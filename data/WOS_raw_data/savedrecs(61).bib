Abstract = {{From 1991 to 1993 we radio-collared and monitored 50 porcupines
   (Erethizon dorsatum) in central Massachusetts to obtain estimates of
   survival and reproduction, and applied these estimates to a model of
   porcupine population dynamics to estimate the annual rate of change
   (lambda). The annual survival rate for all adult (>1 year old)
   porcupines was 0.67 +/- 0.07 (mean +/- SE). Survival was higher, but not
   significantly so (P = 0.22), for adult females (0.74 +/- 0.08) than for
   adult males (0.56 +/- 0.12). Adult porcupines died of starvation (annual
   mortality rate 0.08), injuries (0.05), interactions with humans (0.04),
   and disease (0.05) but not predation. Annual survival of juveniles (<1
   year old) ranged from at least 0.37 in 1992 to at most 0.39 in 1993.
   Minimum birth rates of radio-collared females >2 years old, determined
   by sightings of young near females, lactation, and pregnancy status as
   determined by ultrasound, were 0.64 in 1992 and 0.62 in 1993.
   Incorporation of maximum and minimum values of demographic parameters
   from this study and from the literature into population models indicated
   a decreasing porcupine population.}},

Title = {{Natural and human-induced disturbance of seagrasses}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17-27}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Many natural and human-induced events create disturbances in seagrasses
   throughout the world, but quantifying losses of habitat is only
   beginning. Over the last decade, 90 000 ha of seagrass loss have been
   documented although the actual area lost is certainly greater.
   Seagrasses, an assemblage of marine flowering plant species, are
   valuable structural and functional components of coastal ecosystems and
   are currently experiencing worldwide decline. This group of plants is
   known to support a complex trophic food web and a detritus-based food
   chain, as well as to provide sediment and nutrient filtration, sediment
   stabilization, and breeding and nursery areas for finfish and shellfish.
   We define disturbance, natural or human-induced, as any event that
   measurably alters resources available to seagrasses so that a plant
   response is induced that results in degradation or loss; Applying this
   definition, we find a common thread in many seemingly unrelated seagrass
   investigations. We review reports of seagrass loss from both published
   and `grey' literature and evaluate the types of disturbances that have
   caused seagrass decline and disappearance. Almost certainly more
   seagrass has been lost globally than has been documented or even
   observed, but the lack of comprehensive monitoring and seagrass mapping
   makes an assessment of true loss of this resource impossible to
   determine.
   Natural disturbances that are most commonly responsible for seagrass
   loss include hurricanes, earthquakes, disease, and grazing by
   herbivores. Human activities most affecting seagrasses are those which
   alter water quality or clarity: nutrient and sediment loading from
   runoff and sewage disposal, dredging and filling, pollution, upland
   development, and certain fishing practices. Seagrasses depend on an
   adequate degree of water clarity to sustain productivity in their
   submerged environment. Although natural events have been responsible for
   both large-scale and local losses of seagrass habitat, our evaluation
   suggests that human population expansion is now the most serious cause
   of seagrass habitat loss, and specifically that increasing anthropogenic
   inputs to the coastal oceans are primarily responsible for the
   world-wide decline in seagrasses.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of using
   trans,trans-muconic acid (MA) as a biomarker of environmental benzene
   exposure. A secondary aim was to provide data on the extent of exposure
   to selected toxicants in a unique population consisting of inner-city
   children who were already overexposed to one urban hazard, lead.
   Potential sources of benzene were assessed by a questionnaire. Exposure
   biomarkers including urinary MA and continine and blood lead. Mean MA
   was 176.6 +/- 341.7 ng/mg creatinine in the 79 children who
   participated. A wide range of values was found with as many as 10.1\%,
   depending on the comparison study, above the highest levels reported in
   adults not exposed by occupation. Mean MA was increased in children
   evaluated in the afternoon compared to morning, those at or above the
   median for time spent playing near the street, and those studied in the
   first half of the investigation. MA levels were not associated with
   blood lead or, consistently, with either questionnaire environmental
   tobacco smoke (ETS) data or cotinine. As expected, the mean blood lead
   level was elevated (23.6 mu g/dl). Mean continine was also increased at
   79.2 ng/mg creatinine. We conclude that the use of MA as a biomarker for
   environmental benzene exposure is feasible since it was detectable in
   72\% of subjects with a wide range of values present. In future studies,
   correlation of MA with personal air sampling in environmental exposure
   will be essential to fully interpret the significance of these findings.
   In addition, these inner-city children comprise a high risk group for
   exposure to environmental toxicants including ETS, lead, and probably
   benzene, based on questionnaire sources and its presence in ETS.}},

Abstract = {{We developed and tested a procedure that allows quantification of the
   effects of soil contaminants on earthworm (Eisenia foetida) growth and
   reproduction. The procedure monitors isolated pairs of earthworms and
   generates a higher ratio of data per organism than other commonly used
   procedures. It also incorporates an accurate technique for measuring
   adult growth, has high sensitivity compared to the Organization for
   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 14-d acute toxicity test,
   and is cost effective. We applied the method to a variety of
   soil-testing problems. A food-and-substrate trial using artificial soil
   demonstrated the sensitivity of the method and the need for food
   supplementation to stimulate earthworm reproduction. Application of the
   procedure to assess efficacy of a soil bioremediation technology
   revealed the advantage of measuring both growth and reproduction and
   highlighted the usefulness of a single integrated measure of these two
   responses. The method also was used as a fast-screening analysis for
   field soils in a large-scale ecological risk assessment. Finally, a
   reference toxicant, used in dilution series, demonstrated that responses
   of E. foetida using our method were similar to their responses in the
   OECD artificial-soil test method. The results of this study indicate
   that this procedure can be used both for regulatory and compliance needs
   within the framework of ecological risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation is described into the survival of haddock
   (Melanogrammus aeglifinus (L.)) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus (L.)),
   as a result of escape from 70, 90, 100 and 110 mm diamond mesh cod-ends
   towed at 1.5 m s(-1) by a 550 hp commercial fishing vessel. God-end
   escapes were collected and transferred by divers into 35 m(3) cages on
   the seabed where their survival against control fish was monitored over
   a period of 60 days. Triplicated cage experiments showed a range of
   results for the survival of 15-38 cm haddock and 17-35 cm whiting. The
   survival rates for the haddock and whiting experimental groups were
   48-67\% and 52-60\% (70 mm codend), 79-82\% and 73-78\% (90 mm cod-end).
   73-83\% and 67-77\% (100 mm cod-end) and 85-89\% and 83-86\% (110 mm
   cod-end), respectively. The survival rates of the controls were 100\%
   for both species. These percentages relate only to the numbers of
   survivors from the total escapes in a particular cod-end mesh size
   category, regardless of fish length. Further analysis of the data
   revealed that the survival of the smaller cod-end escapes was much worse
   than for larger fish of either species. This suggests that survival may
   be a more complex function of fish length. Furthermore, there was no
   clear relationship between survival and mesh size for haddock and
   whiting of a given length over the diamond mesh range of 70-110 mm. The
   data from each of the haddock and whiting survival/mortality probability
   curves were applied to the four mesh size selectivity gives obtained on
   the actual haddock and whiting Populations studied. This produced data
   to predict the Fate of haddock and whiting of given length after
   entering the trawl for each of the four diamond mesh sizes, in terms of
   survival, mortality, discards and marketable catch.}},

Abstract = {{Previously reported competition experiments among Artemia (brine shrimp)
   species have not incorporated abiotic variability into their
   experimental design. Recent field and laboratory investigations point to
   temperature as a critical factor in determining the biogeographic
   distribution and competitive ability of sexual and parthenogenetic
   Artemia.
   One sexual diploid strain A. tunisiana Bowen (S) and two A.
   parthenogenetica Barigozzi strains {[}one diploid (PD) and one
   tetraploid (PT)] were raised as single populations and as competitive
   cultures at 15 degrees, 24 degrees and 30 degrees C. Cultures were
   scored for competitive outcome (coexistence, exclusion) and were
   periodically monitored for population age-structure density and female
   parturition mode (encysted vs. non-encysted offspring).
   Temperature affected competitive outcome as follows: at 15 degrees C, S
   > PD > PT; at 24 degrees C, PD > S > PT; at 30 degrees C, PD > PT > S.
   When physiological responses and demographic traits were examined,
   factors that contribute to competitive abilities could be identified. At
   30 degrees C, S die before reproductive maturity, an obvious factor
   contributing to their elimination at warm temperatures. For PT more than
   73\% of the offspring were encysted. While this would be advantageous
   for reestablishing the population following adverse field conditions
   and/or colonization of new sites, it is disadvantageous in continuous
   sympatric cultures where competitor strains produce primarily
   non-encysted embryos.}},

Abstract = {{From 12 Jan.-9 Apr. 1993, 25 Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax
   auritus) were captured, fitted with radio-telemetry transmitters, and
   monitored to determine night-roost fidelity and movements in the Delta
   Region of Mississippi. Transmitter-equipped cormorants were located at
   15 different roost sites during the study. The mean number of roosts
   used by cormorants was 2.08 +/- 0.172 SE. The mean number of
   transmitter-equipped cormorants located each week was 8.25 +/- 0.87 SE.
   The distances moved by cormorants among night roosts ranged from 0-398
   km. In the eastern part of the Delta Region two studies were conducted
   concurrently with this telemetry study to determine if repeated
   harassment of roosting cormorants using pyrotechnics would cause
   cormorants to abandon selected roosts and nearby aquaculture facilities.
   Dispersed roosts were repeatedly harassed with pyrotechnics in the
   eastern part of the Delta Region and non-dispersed roosts in the western
   part of the Delta Region were not harassed. There was no significant
   difference in cormorant movement to more than one roost after
   transmitter attachment between birds captured in dispersed roosts versus
   non-dispersed roosts. Three transmitter-equipped cormorants were located
   on the Gulf coast approximately 390 km from the study area. One
   subsequently moved back to the study area These observations provide
   evidence that in Mississippi wintering populations of cormorants show no
   strong fidelity to a primary roost, but shift throughout the Delta
   Region and to the Gulf coast.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance of all tree and shrub species has been monitored for eight
   years in a 50 ha census plot in tropical moist forest in central Panama.
   Here we examine population trends of the 219 most numerous species in
   the plot, assessing the impact of a long-term drying trend. Population
   change was calculated as the mean rate of increase (or decrease) over
   eight years, considering either all stems greater than or equal to 10 mm
   diameter at breast height (dbh) or just stems greater than or equal to
   100 mm dbh. For stems greater than or equal to 10 mm, 40\% of the
   species had mean growth rates <1\% per year (either increasing or
   decreasing) and 12\% had changes greater than or equal to 5\% per year.
   For stems greater than or equal to 100 mm, the figures were 38\% and
   8\%.
   Species that specialize on the slopes of the plot, a moist microhabitat
   relative to the plateau, suffered significantly more declines in
   abundance than species that did not prefer slopes (stems greater than or
   equal to 10 mm dbh). This pattern was due entirely to species of small
   stature: 91\% of treelets and shrubs that were slope-specialists
   declined in abundance, but just 19\% of non-slope treelets and shrubs
   declined. Among larger trees, slope and non-slope species fared equally.
   For stems greater than or equal to 100 mm dbh, the slope effect vanished
   because there were few shrubs and treelets with stems greater than or
   equal to 100 mm dbh. Another edaphic guild of species, those occurring
   preferentially in a small swamp in the centre of the plot, were no more
   likely to decline in abundance than non-swamp species, regardless of
   growth form. Species that preferentially colonize canopy gaps in the
   plot were slightly more likely to decrease in abundance than
   non-colonizing species (only for stems greater than or equal to 10 mm
   dbh, not greater than or equal to 100 mm). Despite this overall trend,
   however, several colonizing species had the most rapidly increasing
   populations in the plot.
   The impact of a 25-year drying trend and an associated increase in the
   severity of the 4-month dry season is having an obvious impact on the
   BCI forest. At least 16 species of shrubs and treelets with affinities
   for moist microhabitats are headed for extinction in the plot.
   Presumably, these species invaded the forest during a wetter period
   prior to 1966. A severe drought of 1983 that caused unusually high tree
   mortality contributed to this trend, and may also have been responsible
   for sharp increases in abundance of a few gap-colonizers because it
   temporarily opened the forest canopy. The BCI forest is remarkably
   sensitive to a subtle climatic shift, yet we do not know whether this is
   typical for tropical forests because no other large-scale censuses exist
   for comparison.}},

Abstract = {{It has often been observed that the abundance of sea urchins is lower
   inside kelp forests and along their nearshore edges than outside their
   offshore boundaries. We tested the hypothesis that this distributional
   pattern is a reflection of settlement patterns by monitoring settlement
   on artificial surfaces at 3 kelp forests near San Diego, California,
   USA. We estimated settlement at paired sites under the canopy and
   outside the offshore edge of the kelp forests and at paired sites
   located 20 m outside the canopy near the inshore and offshore boundaries
   of each kelp forest. There was no evidence of an effect of dense stands
   of giant kelp on the settlement of purple sea urchins. The results for
   red sea urchins were ambiguous; in 3 of 7 comparisons, average
   settlement was higher or observations of higher settlement were more
   frequent offshore from the kelp forest than elsewhere. Although this
   could result from different effects on the 2 species, we think it
   probably was due to accidents of sampling. We conclude that the
   distributional patterns of purple and red sea urchins relative to kelp
   forests are unlikely to reflect larval availability or settlement, but
   are more probably a function of post-settlement events. We qualify our
   conclusions because of the tremendous temporal variability in the
   physical and biological factors that can potentially affect the local
   distribution of sea urchin larvae. The 2 years of this study may be
   short relative to natural cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Overwintered Yespula germanica colonies make a major contribution to the
   total wasp population in some New Zealand habitats. All vespulid
   colonies found at two scrubland-pasture sites near Hamilton, New
   Zealand, were monitored in three successive years to record the
   frequency of overwintering. Ten percent of V. germanica colonies
   overwintered but no V. vulgaris colonies did so. Prey collected by an
   overwintered V. germanica colony was sampled over 13 months by
   intercepting returning foragers. The most common prey recorded were
   arthropods of the orders Diptera, Araneae, and Lepidoptera. The
   proportions of different prey orders in the diet varied seasonally. In
   winter-spring compared with summer-autumn, Diptera decreased while
   Lepidoptera and other orders increased. An estimated 125.6kg of prey was
   carried into the two overwintered colonies for which traffic rate was
   measured, 29\% of which was captured during winter-spring
   (June-November) when foragers from annual colonies are few or absent.
   Overwintered colonies contributed an estimated 50\% of the total forager
   population, and consumed 70\% of the total prey captured by vespulid
   wasps during a year in this habitat.}},

Abstract = {{In 1994, we conducted aerial, mail, and telephone surveys to determine
   the distribution and abundance of roof-nesting gulls in states bordering
   the Great Lakes. We documented more than 7,922 nesting pairs of gulls at
   30 colonies in four states; species composition was 71\% ring-billed
   (Larus delawarensis), 24\% herring (L. argentatus), and 5\% unknown.
   Colony size ranged from 1 to 1,003 nesting pairs. Proportions of
   ring-billed gulls nesting less that 5.0 and more than 10.0 km from the
   Great Lakes were 31\% and 39\%, in contrast to 63\% and less than 1\%
   for herring gulls, respectively, Maximum distances herring and
   ring-billed gull colonies were located from the Great Lakes were 23.5
   and 58.0 km, respectively. Roof-nesting ring-billed and herring gulls
   represented approximately 2\% and 4\%, respectively, of the total
   nesting population for these species in the U.S. portion of the Great
   Lakes, As previous surveys of colonial waterbirds in the Great Lakes did
   not document roof-nesting gull colonies, future surveys should include
   potential inland colony sites, particularly roofs and other urban
   habitats to obtain more accurate estimates of total population size and
   to monitor population trends of roof-nesting gulls.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments on the parasitoid Aphidius ervi and its host, the pea aphid
   Acyrthosiphon pisum, produced what appeared to be a paradox. In a
   laboratory cage, we monitored the population densities of parasitoids
   and pea aphids for roughly seven parasitoid generations, over which time
   the parasitoid eventually went extinct. This occurred despite the
   parasitoid's high potential fecundity and the superabundance of its
   host. To investigate this apparent paradox, we performed further
   experiments to quantify the parasitoid's numerical response - the number
   of adult parasitoids produced per host killed. A. ervi develops as an
   egg and larva within its living host for approximately eight d, and we
   estimated survival of parasitoids over this period between 2.8\% and
   6.4\%. The estimated parasitoid survival depends on the
   density-dependent survival of the pea aphids, with low survival of
   aphids and consequently larval parasitoids occurring at high aphid
   densities. Therefore, the population growth rate of A. ervi will be the
   lowest when aphid densities are high, and this will limit the ability of
   A. ervi to control aphid outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behaviour of Crab Plovers is directly analogous to the
   `walk-stop-search-walk' hunting behaviour of true plovers, and changes
   slightly depending whether the birds are foraging on sand or in water:
   they are nonterritorial when foraging. Crabs dominate the diet, but
   other invertebrates and fish are also eaten. Foraging efficiency
   increases with age and adults and subadults are able to satisfy their
   daily energy requirements in a single tidal cycle. The population of
   Crab Plovers at Mida Creek was much larger in 1994 than in 1992, but in
   1994 adults achieved much higher intake rates than in 1992, suggesting
   considerable year-to-year variation in the carrying capacity of Mida
   Creek for Crab Plovers. The world population of 43-50 000 birds breeds
   at very few colonies and the species is thus a potential conservation
   concern. Because of the relative accessibility of large concentrations
   of Crab Plovers away from the breeding grounds, we suggest that a
   programme to monitor numbers and population demography should be
   targeted at nonbreeding aggregations.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of populations of the northern red-backed vole, carried out
   in the Kamenskii raion, Sverdlovskaya oblast, over two years (1992 and

   an increase in the number of small morphogenetic aberrations and
   malformations in the skull structure steadily manifested itself in the
   exposed territory (along the axis of the Eastern Ural Radioactive
   Trace-EURT). It is revealed that the exposed sample has a steady
   undirectional deviation from the control ones, located outside the EURT
   zone, with respect to the frequencies of the phenes of nonmetric cranial
   traits, which do not depend on annual conditions and testifies to the
   genetic nature of the distinctions. It is assumed that these differences
   are accounted for by the chronic effects of small radiation doses on the
   processes of individual development in the northern red-backed vole and
   the accumulation of small genetic aberrations leading to the
   manifestation of an increased concentration of phenotypic malformations
   in the EURT zone.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental releases of low levels of radioactivity can occur as a
   consequence of normal operations at nuclear facilities. In England and
   Wales, the impact of gaseous discharges on the terrestrial environment
   is monitored routinely by the site operators as well as by Food Science
   Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The
   terrestrial surveillance programme carried out by MAFF Food Science
   concentrates on agricultural produce to provide assessments of doses to
   members of the population derived from the consumption of terrestrial
   foodstuffs. We present here the results of a survey, undertaken in 1993
   to supplement the monitoring data of MAFF, of artificial radioactive
   contamination around eighteen nuclear establishments in England and
   Wales. Grass and soil samples were used as indicators of environmental
   contamination at these sites for the radionuclides Cs-137, Sr-90,
   Pu-239+240 and Am-241. When compared to estimated background
   radionuclide concentrations close to each site, these data reveal that
   four of the 18 sites have contributed measurable increases to both the
   Cs-137 and Pu-239+240 inventory within 500 m outside the boundary fence.
   Two additional sites showed slight increases above the expected
   background soil levels of Pu-239+240.}},

Abstract = {{The biology of the zebra mussel is reviewed as it relates to
   water-quality problems in rivers. A relationship between population
   densities of the zebra mussel and their respiration demands for oxygen
   is developed, which can be used to support the analysis of the impact of
   zebra mussel infestation on the oxygen resources of streams and rivers.
   Dramatic changes in the water quality of the Seneca River, N.Y., a major
   tributary to Lake Ontario, have been brought about by zebra mussel
   infestation. These changes are documented from 3 years of monitoring
   data. The infestation converted the Seneca River from a turbid,
   phytoplankton-rich, nutrient-depleted system, with nearly saturated
   oxygen concentrations, to a river with high clarity, low-phytoplankton
   concentrations, enriched in dissolved nutrients, with greatly
   undersaturated oxygen concentrations. The degradation of oxygen
   resources was severe enough to cause violations of New York State
   standards for daily minimum and daily average concentrations for a
   number of days in the late summer of 1993. The associated loss in the
   waste assimilative capacity of the river is confounding waste discharge
   management and planning efforts in the river basin. This form of
   degradation is expected for other systems as the zebra mussel
   infestation spreads. The impact is expected to be greatest in rivers and
   streams with high concentrations of phytoplankton, large areas of rock
   substrate, and limited reaeration capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The toxic effects of 2,4-D on Phaedoactylum tricornutum (Bohlin) and
   Dunaliella tertiolecta (Butcher), two species of phytoplankton well
   suited to bioassay studies and responsive to pollutants, were studied by
   monitoring changes in growth in terms of cell populations, chlorophyll
   fluorescence and the rate of (CO2)-C-14 assimilation. Short term
   bioassays, batch and continuous cultures were studied. Pure 2,4-D acid
   appeared more toxic than the commercial amine form of the herbicide but
   this may have been due to small quantities of acetone present in the
   solvent. Concentrations of amine herbicide in excess of 100 mg l(-1)
   extended the duration of the lag phase and inhibited growth but smaller
   concentrations stimulated growth, the amine being consumed by
   phytoplankton in preference to nitrate. Continuous culture confirmed the
   ability of phytoplankton to adapt slowly to herbicide concentrations
   even as high as 500 mg l(-1). It is suggested that green algae adapt
   more rapidly to environmental change than do diatoms.}},

Abstract = {{The proportion of a crocodilian population seen during night spotlight
   counts (sighting proportion) is affected by environmental conditions. I
   developed multiple regression models to estimate the sighting proportion
   of black caimans (Melanosuchus niger) using 7 environmental variables as
   predictors. Although the models were statistically powerful, their use
   in long-term monitoring programs appeared to be limited, given that
   changes in density affected the sighting proportion. This finding has
   implications in the management of wild populations of crocodilians;
   long-term monitoring programs based on night counts usually assume that,
   once the environmental effects have been accounted for, the sighting
   proportion remains constant over time.}},

Abstract = {{North American populations of Mountain Plovers (Charadrius montanus)
   have declined 63\% since 1966. Using radiotelemetry, we monitored plover
   nesting and brood rearing during the 1993 and 1993 breeding seasons in
   Weld County, Colorado. Our objectives were to extend preliminary
   breeding studies of 1992 (Miller and Knopf 1993) and to determine the
   minimum area required for successful reproduction by this species.
   Plovers began arriving on the breeding grounds in mid-March. Due to a
   high incidence of predation, eggs hatched in only nine of 34 (26\%)
   nests in 1993 and in 20 of 54 (37\%) nests in 1994. Daily survival rates
   of chicks were 0.957 (442 telemetry days, 44 chicks) and 0.951 (610
   telemetry days, 42 chicks) each year, respectively. Plover broods moved
   an average 337 +/- 46.5 m/day (N = 30) and 298 +/- 41.9 m/day (N = 14)
   in 1993 and 1994 (t = 1.10, P = 0.27), respectively. Plovers that raised
   chicks to hedging used between 28 and 91 ha, averaging 56.6 +/- 21.5 ha.
   Daily movement rates (t = 0.7, P = 0.48) and total area used (t = 1.4, P
   = 0.17) were similar between broods where greater than or equal to one
   chick hedged and broods from which no chicks hedged. Success of plovers
   in raising chicks appeared related either to overall fox activity in the
   area or to how effectively the adult detected and distracted foxes. Most
   plovers left the breeding grounds in mid-to-late July, four months after
   arrival. Population declines of Mountain Plovers appear independent of
   any recent landscape fragmentation within this breeding stronghold of
   the species.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the distribution of blood lead levels and lead in
   various environmental samples (water sediments, soils, and air) near the
   Shing-Yie storage battery recycling plant in Taiwan before (July 1990 to
   June 1991) and after (July 1992 to June 1993) amelioration. Before
   amelioration, the average blood lead levels in the neighborhood of the
   plant were in the range of 10.55 +/- 5.7 to 12.28 +/- 7.9 mu g/dl. After
   amelioration, relatively lower average concentrations of blood lead
   (range 8.35 +/- 3.0 to 9.13 +/- 2.5 mu g/dl) were generally found;
   however, these averages were still higher than that (7.79 +/- 3.5 mu
   g/dl) from other lead-unpolluted areas of Taiwan. An exceedingly high
   geometric mean (GM) lead concentration (128 mu g/L) was found in the
   downstream river water of the Tawulum River passing by the plant. The
   concentrations of lead (GM = 372 and 418 mu g/g) in the downstream river
   sediments were higher than those (GM = 123 and 158 mu g/g) in the
   upstream river sediments before and after amelioration, respectively.
   Furthermore, lead species in river sediments were analyzed by a
   sequential leaching technique. The sum of phases I, II, and III
   accounted for 83.7\% of total lead at station R(2) (nearest to the
   plant). Maximum lead concentration (GM = 2402 mu g/g) in dust at the
   soil surface from station S-1 (nearest to the plant) was much higher
   than those from the other stations by about 18 times before
   amelioration. However, the maximum value dropped to 1,155 mu g/g after
   amelioration. On the whole, the geometric mean concentration of lead in
   dust at the soil surface nearest to the plant was >1,000 mu g/g and
   decreased to <100 mu g/g in the 15-30 cm depth soil about 2 km away from
   the plant. Before amelioration, the geometric mean lead concentration of
   4.57 mu g/m(3) (range 0.102-37.6 mu g/m(3)) in the air near the plant
   was higher than that at the background locations, the geometric mean
   value of which was 0.08 mu g/m(3).}},

   maculata De Geer. Fourth instars of C. maculata were exposed by direct
   contact with a granular formulation of B. bassiana containing 1.1 x

   was the fungus isolated from any of the exposed coccinellids.
   Coleomegilla maculata populations and indigenous B. bassiana on corn
   plants and in the soil also were monitored in held plots under three
   tillage systems. Results suggested a spatial and temporal specificity
   for B. bassiana. When C. maculata density was highest, B. bassiana was
   not isolated from corn plant tissues (leaf collar). We concluded that

Abstract = {{Individually marked bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) were monitored to
   determine how seasonal and lifetime changes in mass affected the
   development of sexual dimorphism, and to what extent mass at a given age
   could predict mass of the same sheep at a later age. We trapped sheep
   from late May to early October each year from 1971 to 1985 in a
   population artificially kept at low density. Lambs and yearlings gained
   mass linearly from June to September, while absolute mass gain of older
   sheep was faster in June-July than in August-September. Males gained
   more mass than females each summer up to at least 3 years of age.
   Relative summer mass gain, calculated as a proportion of body mass at
   the beginning of June, was the same for male and female lambs but was
   greater for male than for female yearlings and 2-year-olds. With the
   exception of lambs, all age-classes lost mass during winter. Mass loss
   between September 15 and June 5 was greater for females than for males,
   possibly because ewes lost mass through parturition in late May. For
   both sexes, asymptotic mass was not reached until at least 7 years of
   age. Mass at 4 and 12 months of age was correlated with mass at 4 years.
   For all sex-age classes, mass on June 5 was negatively correlated with
   summer mass gain. For lambs and yearlings, winter mass loss was
   positively correlated with mass on September 15. Our results suggest
   that at low population density, sheep optimize rather than maximize
   summer mass accumulation. Most sexual dimorphism develops after weaning,
   through faster mass gain by males than by females at 1 and 2 years of
   age and possibly a longer season of mass gain each year for males than
   for females after females reach puberty.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of a remnant population of the palm Neodypsis decaryi were
   characterized using a linear stage-structured demographic model. This
   palm is a threatened keystone species restricted to a narrow ecological
   zone in southeastern Madagascar. The population showed high mortality
   rates in the early stages of the life cycle, followed by a period of
   lower adult mortality. Demographic, results indicated that the
   population was either stable or increasing inside the reserve (lambda(m)
   close to 1.0). Sensitivity and elasticity analyses indicated that adult
   stage classes were the most sensitive to producing changes in population
   growth rates . Continued biological monitoring is appropriate for the
   long-term conservation management of this palm inside the reserve.
   Outside the protected area the population appears to be declining
   rapidly;mainly because of anthropogenic effects (especially fire and
   grazing). If the conservation of Neodypsis decaryi is to be successful
   In the long term, then conservation methods must be carried oat in
   cooperation with local villagers, and the species should be managed as a
   renewable resource in situ and ex situ. In situ conservation should
   include nlltivntiolz of this species throughout its natural range and
   protection of the existing viable natural populations. Alternative
   conservation management practices, both ecologically and economically,
   sustainable, may be useful to alleviate the human pressures on this
   renewable resource. If leaves of N. decaryi are to be harvested by local
   people, we recommend restricting annual harvesting to about 25\% of
   leaves per tree per year, Based on sensitivity analysis, seed collection
   should be kept well below 95\% of the yearly crop if harvesting is not
   to have a significant impact on population growth rates.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies demonstrated strong fertility selection for a
   self-fertile, homostyle morph due to pollinator loss in an isolated
   population of Primula sieboldii, an endangered heterostylous species. To
   predict genetic consequences of the selection we developed a
   deterministic genetic model based on a classical `'super-gene'' model
   and we studied the effects of pollinator availability and inbreeding
   depression on temporal changes of morph frequencies through model
   simulation. Because of the severe pollinator limitation experienced by
   the population fast, irreversible loss of the thrum morph from the
   population was predicted even if high inbreeding depression was assumed
   To prevent the breakdown of the normal breeding system of the species,
   morph frequency monitoring for timely active management should be
   implemented Active management should include hand pollinations and
   pollinator therapy-reintroduction and reestablishment of suitable
   pollinator populations The method we adopted in this study to
   parametrize pollinator availability can be used widely in conservation
   modeling for a range of plant species that have multiple mating types
   with different degrees of self-incompatibility.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},

Abstract = {{Many heavily fished coral reefs have a high abundance of sea urchins
   that may suppress the recovery of fish and coral populations once
   fishing effort is,reduced or eliminated Restoration of these reefs may
   be accelerated by intervening and reducing sea urchin
   populations-particularly those of long-lived species. We studied three
   Kenyan coral-reef lagoons to determine the influence of reductions in
   sea urchin populations on coral algae, and fish populations. Populations
   were monitored seven times over a 1-year period in 50 X 50 m
   unmanipulated control plots and experimental sere urchin reduction plots
   where sea urchin populations were reduced by about 85\%. Census of the
   most-abundant fish families found the greatest positive population
   responses to sea urchin reduction in plots protected from fishing. The
   wet weights of fish nearly tripled population density increased by 65\%,
   and species richness increased by 30\% compared with adjacent control
   plots. Parrotfish, wrasse, scavenger and snapper families showed the
   greatest population and wet-weight increases lit the two fished reefs,
   fish populations also increased but to a lesser neg, ee than in the
   unfished reef-particularly when comparing the wet-weight estimates of
   fish. Small-bodied species of the dam-selfish and wrasse families and
   juvenile parrotfish exhibited the largest population increases in these
   fished reefs. In fished reefs algae and seagrass cover exhibited the
   greatest increases following sea urchin reduction. Seagrass colonized
   bare sand, whereas fleshy brown algae colonized hard substrate (dead
   coral). The tall canopy-forming alga Sargassum latifolium became the
   dominant alga in the unfished reef was about half that the two fished
   reefs-attributable to the greater abundance of parrotfish in the
   unfished reef. This suggests that greater herbivory in the unfished reef
   kept the algae from reaching an algal forest climax typified by
   Sargassum dominance. In the fished reefs the high S. latifolium cover
   and the increased thickness of the algal turf reduced hard coral cover
   by around 30\% In the unfished reef coral cover was reduced by around
   13\%, but by the end of the experiment coral cover and genera richness
   were the same in both the control and the sea urchin reduction plots. We
   conclude that, primarily, fishing and, secondarily and indirectly, high
   sea urchin abundance are reducing fish numbers and diversity in Kenyan
   reefs and that sea urchin reduction has the potential to increase reef
   fisheries production and recovery from overfishing. Sea urchin reduction
   is not recommended, however, on moderately fished reefs due to the
   possible loss of coral cover and diversity. If reefs are either severely
   degraded or if fishing effort is reduced or eliminated, then sea urchin
   reduction is recommended for the restoration of fish numbers, feeding
   importance, species diversity, and fisheries production.}},

Abstract = {{We compiled published and unpublished records of large nestings of White
   Ibises (Eudocimus albus) in the United States between 1930 and 1993. The
   resulting database provides evidence of at least four major geographic
   shifts of the breeding population Of White Ibises during the period
   Banding returns and colony histories demonstrate that the movements were
   not migratory. The extremely fast growth of most White Ibis breeding
   colonies indicates that local recruitment could not have fueled the
   large increases in breeding numbers in colonized areas Ibises seem to
   colonize wetland areas that have good feeding resources and to abandon
   areas that lose the ability to supply this resource. Mechanisms of
   attraction to new sites and repulsion from degraded ones may work: alone
   or in tandem. Degradation of breeding sites frequently occurs through
   natural processes, such as hurricanes, stochastic weather patterns, and
   wetland conditions, and the nomadic behavior of White Ibises appears to
   be an obligate life-history feature. Although surveys throughout the
   range of the U.S. population of White Ibises hare never been
   comprehensive, available records indicate minimum breeding populations
   of 125,000 pairs in 1933, 170,000 pairs in 1976, and 51,000 pairs in
   1991. The U.S. population as a whole appears to be decreasing. White
   Ibises share a suite of population, social, and movement characteristics
   with a number of nomadic species. Conservation strategies for these
   species may differ fundamentally from those targeting more sedentary
   species. Nomadic species may typically depend on large populations to
   find food and to stimulate breeding and are therefore likely to decline
   abruptly and unpredictably as habitat is lost or degraded Rapid
   population declines may occur at population levels well above those
   predicted by genetic and minimum viability models. Because of its
   nomadic habit, the survival Of this species may depend on a regional
   planning approach. To conserve this species we recommend a continuing
   commitment to the monitoring, assessment and preservation of a mosaic of
   fresh and estuarine wetlands in the southeastern US.; the maintenance of
   natural disturbances needed to produce pulses of food in these wetlands,
   and the coordination of management efforts throughout tbe US., as well
   as between the U.S. and Cuba.}},

Abstract = {{All organisms have the ability to respond and adapt to a myriad of
   environmental insults, The human respiratory epithelium, when exposed to
   oxidant gases in photochemical smog, is at risk of DNA damage and
   requires efficient cellular adaptative responses to resist the
   environmentally induced cell damage. Ozone and its reaction products
   induce in vitro and in vivo DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) in
   respiratory epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. To determine if
   exposure to a polluted atmosphere with ozone as the main criteria
   pollutant induces SSBs in nasal epithelium, we studied 139 volunteers,
   including a control population of 19 children and 13 adult males who
   lived in a low-polluted Pacific port, 69 males and 16 children who were
   permanent residents of Southwest Metropolitan Mexico City (SWMMC), and
   22 young males newly arrived to SWMMC and followed for 12 weeks.
   Respiratory symptoms, nasal cytology and histopathology, cell
   viabilities, and single-cell gel electrophoresis were investigated.
   Atmospheric pollutant data were obtained from a fixed-site monitoring
   station. SWMMC volunteers spent >7 hr/day outdoors and all had upper
   respiratory symptoms. A significant difference in the numbers of
   DNA-damaged nasal cells was observed between control and chronically
   exposed subjects, both in children (p<0.00001) and in adults (p<0.01).
   SSBs in newly arrived subjects quickly increased upon arrival to the
   city, from 39.8 +/- 8.34\% in the first week to 67.29 +/- 2.35 by week
   2. Thereafter, the number of cells with SSBs remained stable in spite of
   the continuous increase in cumulative ozone, suggesting a threshold for
   cumulative DNA nasal damage. Exposure to a polluted urban atmosphere
   induces SSBs in human nasal respiratory epithelium, and nasal SSBs could
   serve as a biomarker of ozone exposure. Further, because DNA strand
   breaks are a threat to cell viability and genome integrity and appear to
   be a critical lesion responsible for p53 induction, nasal SSBs should be
   evaluated in ozone-exposed individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Average daily dietary exposures to 11 contaminants were estimated for
   approximately 120,000 adults by combining data on annual diet, as
   measured by a food frequency questionnaire, with contaminant residue
   data for table-ready foods that were collected as part of the annual
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration Total Diet Study. The contaminants
   included in the analysis were four heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead,
   mercury), three organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos, diazinon,
   malathion), and four organochlorine pesticides (dieldrin, p,p'-DDE,
   lindane, heptachlor epoxide). Dietary exposures to these contaminants
   were highly variable among individuals, spanning two to three orders of
   magnitude. Intraindividual exposures to the metals, organophosphates,
   and organochlorines were estimated to be strongly correlated; Pearson's
   correlation coefficients ranged from 0.28 for lindane:dieldrin to 0.84
   for lead:mercury. For some of compounds (e.g., arsenic and dieldrin), a
   substantial fraction of the population was estimated to have dietary
   intakes in excess of health-based standards established by the EPA.
   Before use for risk assessment or epidemiologic purposes, however, the
   validity of the exposure estimates must be evaluated by comparison with
   biological indicators of chronic exposure. Because of their low
   detection rate in table-ready foods, the estimated distributions of
   exposures for dieldrin, p,p'-DDE, heptachlor epoxide, lindane, diazinon,
   and chlorpyrifos were found to be sensitive to assumed values for
   nondetect samples. Reliable estimates of the population distribution of
   dietary exposures to most other contaminants cannot be made currently,
   due to their low rate of detection in table-ready foods. Monitoring
   programs that use more sensitive study designs and population-based
   assessments for other subpopulations should be a priority for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{During the summers of 1992 and 1993, particle mass concentrations
   (PM(2.5) and PM(10)) were measured at eight sites located within
   metropolitan Philadelphia. Particle sampling was performed
   simultaneously at these sites on alternate days during the summer of
   1992 and every day at seven of these sites during the summer of 1993.
   Sampling was conducted over 24-h periods beginning at 9 AM (EDT) during
   both summers. All PM(2.5) and PM(10) samples were collected using 10
   L/min inertial impactors with particle cutpoints of 2.5 and 10 mu m,
   respectively. In this paper, we examine the relationship among PM(2.5),
   coarse particulate (2.5 < d(a) < 10 mu m), and PM(10) concentrations. In
   addition, we analyze their spatial variation and compare our findings
   with those made in an earlier study of sulfate (SO42-) concentrations.
   PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentrations were found to be relatively uniform
   across Philadelphia, suggesting that concentrations measured at a single
   monitoring site are able to characterize particulate concentrations
   across Philadelphia and other similar urban areas well. Coarse
   particulate concentrations were found to vary spatially within
   Philadelphia, with its variation related to population density. Coarse
   particulate levels were also shown to vary by day of week as weekday
   levels were higher than weekend levels. Variability in PM(10)
   concentrations was driven primarily by variability in PM(2.5)
   concentrations, which in Philadelphia comprised approximately 75\% of
   PM(10). SO42- related species in Philadelphia were, in turn, responsible
   for variability in PM(2.5) and, as a result, in PM(10) as well.
   SO42--associated species were the largest component of both PM(2.5) and
   PM(10) concentrations, comprising approximately 65 and 50\% of their
   concentrations, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Yellow cypress (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D.Don) Spach) stecklings
   (stock derived from rooted cuttings) were fall (September 1990) and
   spring-planted (April, 1991) on a coastal reforestation site in British
   Columbia to determine the influence of planting season and various
   nursery cultural treatments on steckling establishment, growth and
   survival, Gas exchange and water relations measurements were made in the
   first year after planting, with morphological development monitored
   during the first and second year. A randomized complete block design (6
   blocks) was used and influence of planting season was analyzed as an
   independent factor from the nursery cultural treatments. Nursery
   cultural treatment means within each plant-time population were similar
   (t-test, a = 0.05), with no effect on steckling physiology during the
   first growing season. Moisture stress nursery cultural treatments
   produced smaller stecklings (e.g. shoot height, diameter, root and shoot
   dry weights) than well-watered treatments, but morphological differences
   disappeared after the first year, Water relation parameters indicated
   that fall-planted stock had greater turgor maintenance than
   spring-planted stock throughout the first growing season (e.g. fall
   greater than or equal to spring in predawn and minimum shoot water
   potentials, total and utilized turgor, fall less than or equal to spring
   in osmotic potential at saturation and turgor loss point, and relative
   water content at turgor loss point). Spring-planted stecklings had
   greater maximum net photosynthesis under optimum conditions in a
   controlled environment, but had lower net photosynthesis under low air
   temperature conditions in the field, compared with fall-planted
   stecklings. Fall-planted stecklings had greater stomatal conductance
   under all measured field climatic conditions, except moderate conditions
   when both populations had similar stomatal conductance, Shortly after
   fall planting, extreme environmental conditions (i.e. soil surface
   temperatures of 42 degrees C, evaporative demand > 4 kPa and steckling
   minimum shoot water potentials of -1.61 +/- 0.04 MPa) resulted in high
   fall-planted steckling mortality, As a result, survival rates measured 8
   weeks after spring planting were 82.9\% and 99.8\% for fall- and
   spring-planted stecklings, respectively, Thereafter, spring planting,
   mortality was low and similar between the two plane-time populations.
   Fall-planted stecklings had greater root development early in the first
   growing season, but by season end, spring-planted stecklings had greater
   root development. At the end of the second growing season, both
   populations were similar in shoot development, though spring-planted
   stecklings had greater root development.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the genetic structure of plant populations is necessary for
   the understanding of the dynamics of major ecological processes. It also
   has applications in conservation biology and risk assessment for
   genetically modified crops. This paper reports the genetic structure of
   a linear population of sea beet, Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima (the wild
   relative of sugar beet), on Furzey Island, Poole Harbour. The relative
   spatial positions of the plants were accurately mapped and the plants
   were scored for variation at isozyme and RFLP loci. Structure was
   analysed by repeated subdivision of the population to find the average
   size of a randomly mating group. Estimates of F-ST between randomly
   mating units were then made, and gave patterns consistent with the
   structure of the population being determined largely by founder effects.
   The implications of these results for the monitoring of transgene spread
   in wild sea beet populations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Diel variations in the vertical distribution of copepods were studied in
   the north coast of Spain and related to the physical and biological
   structure of the water column. Zooplankton samples were taken at three
   different stations during a 24 h period, in the proximity of a drogue
   buoy using a Longhurst Hardy Plankton Recorder (LHPR) sampling net, so
   that it is assumed that the same water mass was sampled continuously.
   Physical and other biological parameters were monitored by Conductivity
   Temperature Depth Recorder (CTD) profiles and vertical Undulating
   Oceanographic Recorder (UNDULATOR) dips for temperature, salinity, and
   chlorophyll a. Copepods were counted and classified into seven
   categories according to their size, and their distribution in the
   vertical plane was analysed using univariate and multivariate
   statistical techniques.
   Vertical distribution of copepods and their developmental stages were
   mainly determined by chlorophyll distribution and, when a subsurface
   chlorophyll maximum was present, small copepods and copepodite stages
   appeared aggregated in this layer. Nocturnal upward movements of the
   population and an ontogenetic component in the position and behaviour of
   the community were also important features that characterised the
   distribution of the community. Those patterns may explain a part of the
   observed variability of the abundances and distribution of the copepods
   in the water column. However, the water mass displacement in the 24 h
   period of study must also be considered as a main variability factor in
   the spatial and temporal distribution of the zooplankton populations.

Abstract = {{It is difficult to make valid comparisons of chimpanzee densities among
   sites because observers calculate them using different methods. We argue
   that nest count estimates of density are preferable to densities from
   home range estimates because of the problems of defining home range.
   There are many problems associated with nest count methods, some of
   which have not been addressed in previous studies. In 1992, we censused
   chimpanzees in the Budongo Forest using three methods; the standing crop
   nest count (SCNC), the marked nest count (MNC), and visual sightings of
   the animals (VS). Each method is based on standard line transect
   techniques. Of 96 nests monitored for decay rate, those constructed in
   the dry seasons decayed faster than those in the wet seasons. All-day
   follows of individual chimpanzees and observations of nesting
   chimpanzees at dusk showed that about 15.8\% of night nests were reused,
   17.5\% of the population did not build nests, and 18.8\% of nests were
   first constructed as day nests. Given the variability in nest decay
   rates, we argue that MNC is a better method than SCNC because it avoids
   having to calculate decay rates.}},

Title = {{A model for the effect of Sphecophaga vesparum vesparum as a biological
   control agent of the common wasp in New Zealand}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-44}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. A model of intermediate complexity is described to predict and
   understand the reasons for the ultimate impact of Sphecophaga vesparum
   vesparum (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), introduced as a classical
   biological control agent of Vespula vulgaris (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) in
   New Zealand. The model was parameterized as far as possible from
   independent field data then fitted to the observed performance of the
   parasitoid over the first 5 years after release.
   2. Wasp nest densities monitored over 5 years and seven sites in beech
   (Nothofagus spp.) forests averaged 12.2 ha(-1), with a maximum of 33
   ha(-1). These are among the highest Vespula densities in the world. A
   Ricker model accounted for changes in nest density from year to year,
   giving a maximum ratio of increase in nest density of 3.3 per year and
   overcompensating density dependence at high densities, probably caused
   by queen competition and nest usurpation in spring.
   3. The parasitoid has established at low levels in two sites, one of
   which has been studied in detail. Here parasitism levels (\% autumn
   nests parasitized) have remained around 5\% for 5 years, with a slight
   suggestion of an upward trend.
   4. The model suggests that ultimate parasitism levels depend almost
   entirely on the parasitoid's effective ratio of increase, R, defined as
   the maximum number of spring adults produced per spring adult (spanning
   several intermediate summer generations). Ultimate suppression of wasp
   nest densities depends on R, the rate of increase in parasitism within a
   year, and the mortality of parasitized early spring nests. The initial
   rate of build-up of parasitism additionally depends on the pattern of
   emergence of parasitoid cocoons, which may extend over 4 years.
   5. R for S. vesparum vesparum at the site where it has established
   appears to be about 1.3-1.6, which is close to the lower limit of 1 for
   persistence. Such values suggest an ultimate suppression of wasp nest
   density and level of parasitism of about 10\% and 25\%, respectively.
   6. The low value of R at this site and the parasitoid's limited likely
   impact, appear to be due to a combination of delayed emergence of
   overwintering cocoons, low overwintering cocoon survival, and low
   production of cocoons per parasitized autumn nest. Additionally, a
   reduced or variable attack rate may contribute to the parasitoid's lack
   of establishment at other sites, possibly due to poor synchrony between
   spring emergence of wasp queens and adult parasitoids.
   7. A more successful parasitoid species or ecotype would need to have a
   higher R value, which requires cocoon emergence after 1 year rather than
   2 or more, and/or higher values for the above parameters, particularly
   overwintering survival of cocoons. In addition, it would have to: act
   after the spring host density dependence; cause a high (> 80\%)
   mortality of parasitized spring nests; and ideally also reduce queen
   output from autumn nests. An alternative to an agent causing mortality
   to spring nests would be a microbial one which significantly reduced
   queen fertility without impairing her competitive ability.
   8. A 50\% reduction in queen output from autumn nests, due to parasitism
   by S. vesparum vesparum, contributes little to host suppression because
   of its timing relative to host density dependence. If an alternative
   agent reduced wasp densities to a greater extent, the additional
   contribution of reduced queen output would become relatively more

Abstract = {{1 The methods commonly used to estimate stem turnover rates (i.e.
   mortality and recruitment) in species rich tropical forests suffer from
   a previously unrecognized artefact. The estimated rate is not
   independent of the census period.
   2 An average rate estimate will decrease with time if the sample
   population cannot be characterized as homogeneous. This artefact may
   have considerable significance for comparisons between permanent plot
   studies that have used different census periods.
   3 We present a theoretical consideration of this census effect. The
   artefact will be severe when a fraction of the population has a very
   much higher mortality rate than the average.
   4 Using a simple formulation we provide a mathematical proof that rate
   estimates will decline with increasing census periods for all but
   perfectly uniform populations.
   5 The phenomenon of apparent rate decrease may be used to provide
   ecologically significant information about the diversity and dynamics of
   the population as it is related to the variance of life expectancies
   within the sample.
   6 Such an artefact complicates evaluation of change over nonstandard
   time intervals and requires careful and detailed attention. Similar
   problems will effect any estimation procedure which cannot account for
   all the rate variation within a study population. Recognition of the
   problem is a necessary first step.}},

   to 2 avermectins, abamectin and MK-243 (4 `'-epi-methylamino-4 `'

   evaluations of 17-19 geographically diverse populations. Both
   avermectins were very potent to 3rd-instar diamondback moth; LC(50)s for
   abamectin and MK-243 ranged from 0.4 to 44.0 ng (AI)/ml and 0.2 to 8.0
   np (AI)/ml, respectively. Although most populations showed resistance to
   methomyl and permethrin, the populations were not resistant to abamectin
   or MK-243. Pairwise correlations indicated lack of cross or multiple
   resistance between the avermectins and methomyl and permethrin. This
   information will serve as an aid for resistance monitoring programs and

Abstract = {{A cotton management program in the Imperial Valley, California, was
   specifically designed to reduce pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella
   (Saunders), populations in the area by optimizing the host-free period.
   The program established 1 March as the earliest planting date, 1
   September for defoliant or plant growth regulator application and 1
   November for cotton stalk destruction and plowdown. In-season
   gossyplure-baited pink bollworm male moth activity monitoring and
   immature green cotton boil inspections for larval infestation were
   encouraged as decision making aids to determine the need for additional
   control action. Male pink bollworm moth catches in gossyplure-baited
   Lingren and delta sticky traps were substantially reduced each year from
   1990 to 1994 following the initiation of the management program in 1989.
   Fewer larvae per cotton boil occurred in the years from 1990 to 1992.
   Fiber quality of commercial cotton sampled was also improved from 1989
   to 1994, as compared with the 1984 to 1988 average. Male moth trap
   catches in gossyplure-baited traps placed around the perimeter of the
   Imperial Valley suggest that pink bollworm moth migration into the
   valley occurred from surrounding cotton growing areas during the growing
   season. Highest numbers of moths were caught in perimeter traps
   directionally placed toward cotton growing areas in the Mexicali, Baja
   California, Mexico, and Bard-Winterhaven and Pale Verde, CA. Cotton
   production, in general, was reduced during 1989-1994 in these areas and
   may have contributed partially to reduced populations in Imperial
   Valley.}},

   Seven flexible cables, each with 20 sensors 15 cm apart, were installed
   vertically in the grain mass along a transect across the diameter of the
   bin. A computer collected and stored the data. The automated system
   detected insects in all of the bins in which insects were found in grain
   samples and provided a good estimate of infestation level. Lesser grain
   beetle, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) was the dominant species, and red
   flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and rice weevil, Sitophilus
   oryzae (L.) were also detected. The number of times that insect sounds
   were detected was correlated with insect density in grain samples over a
   density range of 0-17 insects per kilogram. Insects were most abundant
   in the top center of the wheat stored in bins, and only a few sensors in
   this area were needed for early detection. Insects were found in grain
   samples at 5-37 sensor locations in any bin, but locations differed
   between bins. Insects were found in grain samples at a total of 50
   sensor locations in 10 bins. Sensors will need to be distributed over a
   representative portion of a bin to determine insect infestation levels
   accurately.}},

Title = {{Do marine reserves export adult fish biomass? Evidence from Apo Island,

Abstract = {{A frequent expectation of the use of marine reserves in management of
   coral reef fisheries is maintenance or enhancement of yields to areas
   adjacent to reserves by adult (post-settlement) movements from reserve
   to fished areas (the so-called `spillover effect'). Demonstration of
   this effect has been rare. This paper reports on some circumstantial
   evidence derived from underwater visual census monitoring of densities
   of large predatory coral reef fish {[}Serranidae (Epinephelinae),
   Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae and Carangidae as a group] inside and adjacent
   to a small marine reserve at Apo Island in the central Philippines over
   a 10 yr period (1983 to 1993). The marine reserve (sanctuary) at Apo
   Island was established in 1982 and was protected from fishing for the
   duration of the study. The non-reserve area was open to fishing by up to
   200 municipal fishers using traditional fishing gear (bamboo traps,
   hooks and lines, gill nets and spears). Significant positive
   correlations of both mean density and species richness of large
   predatory fish with duration of reserve protection (from 1 to 11 yr)
   were observed in both the reserve and non-reserve areas surveyed. The
   minimum distance from the boundary of the reserve to the non-reserve
   area surveyed was 200 m. During the first 8 yr of reserve protection
   combined, the density of large predatory fish at distances 200 to 300,
   300 to 400 and 400 to 500 m from the reserve boundary did not differ
   significantly from an even distribution (chi-squared test, p > 0.05).
   During the period of 9 to 11 yr of protection combined, there was a
   significantly higher density of these fish in the area closest to the
   reserve (i.e. in the 200 to 300 m area, chi-squared test, p < 0.05).
   This visual census data is consistent with a proposed model of adult
   fish export from the reserve to the non-reserve areas. Along with
   interview data collected in 1986 and 1992 that showed that fishers were
   unanimous that their yields had increased since the reserve was
   implemented, this study provides evidence for export of adult fish from
   reserve to fished areas.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variations in surf zone fish assemblages and various physical
   factors at 11 sites in False Bay, South Africa, were studied over 2 yr
   from July 1991 to June 1993. Changes in the abundance of fish in the
   surf and in the relative ranking of the more frequently occurring
   species were evident between years and relative to an earlier study. Of
   the 9 environmental variables monitored, only water temperature and wind
   direction varied seasonally. Seasonal fluctuations in fish abundance and
   numbers of species captured were absent, except at 1 site, where numbers
   of species recorded varied seasonally. Physical factors responsible for
   these fluctuations varied in response to differences in the physical
   attributes of the different sites, but water temperature, wave height,
   wind speed and direction and macrophyte abundance were considered to be
   the most important. When data from all sites were combined, the overall
   numbers of fish captured did not appear to vary seasonally. However,
   seasonal patterns were evident in the abundance of juvenile fish in the
   surf, and to a lesser extent in the species richness and total number of
   species captured. Abundance and species richness were highest from
   mid-summer up to the beginning of winter, which is the period during
   which most species recruit into the surf zone. We concluded that even
   when seasonal variations in physical variables such as water temperature
   are not great, spawning periods of surf zone fish are nevertheless timed
   to allow most resident and transient 0+ juveniles to optimise their use
   of this habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Abundances of copepod nauplii, copepodite/adult copepods, and the larvae
   of iteroparous anchovies (primarily the bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli)
   were monitored in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA) at 2 wk intervals for 2 yr.
   All possible pairings of the 3 time-series variables yielded significant
   positive correlations. Nearly all (>98\%) of the collected anchovy
   larvae occurred with prey (nauplius) densities higher than those
   reported to affect larval starvation (<100 l(-1)). The larval
   association with abundant prey could be explained as (1) the remnants of
   earlier larval starvation, or (2) spawning being concentrated in
   zooplankton-rich waters. To evaluate the 2 explanations, the diet of
   adult A. mitchilli was analyzed, and egg/adult prey surveys were
   conducted across a 290 km(2) area of Tampa Bay. In 5 of the 6 spatial
   surveys, A. mitchilli egg abundance was correlated with the abundance of
   calanoid copepods, a principal adult prey item. Calanoids (primarily
   adult Acartia tonsa) were never correlated with net plankton biomass or
   with the eggs of the bay anchovy's congener, Anchoa hepsetus. Calanoids
   were aggregated near sites of stable freshwater discharge during a dry
   season, but became dispersed as discharge increased during a rainy
   season. Among spatial surveys, egg abundance exhibited a strong
   nonlinear relationship with calanoid aggregation (r(2) = 0.96, n = 6, p
   = 0.001). Collectively, these findings suggest that the bay anchovy's
   size-specific fecundity is related to adult prey availability, with
   adult prey availability being represented by a combination of abundance
   and patchiness. We discuss relationships between spawning pattern and
   environmental instability, and suggest that iteroparity serves to
   fine-tune reproductive effort to environmental parameters that are
   relevant to larval survival.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the ecology of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)
   wintering along the upper John Day River in northeastern Oregon from
   late-November through March, 1991-92 and early-December through March,
   1992-93. Our primary objective was to locate night roosts. Secondary
   objectives were to document eagle abundance, locate foraging areas, and
   describe food habits. The number of eagles peaked at 96 during
   early-February 1992 and 64 in early-March 1993. Midwinter Bald Eagle
   Counts and Christmas Bird Counts suggest that the number of bald eagles
   wintering in the area has increased recently. Primary foraging areas
   were the John Day River between Picture Gorge and Blue Mountain Hot
   Springs, the North Fork of the John Day River, and Fox Valley. Mammal
   carrion was an important food; fish, ground squirrels (Spermophilus
   spp.), and birds were also utilized. Sixty one night roosts were located
   and 19 more were suspected. Eighty-five percent of roosts were used by
   less than or equal to 5 bald eagles. Only 16\% of roosts identified in
   1991-92 were used in 1992-93 because eagles moved frequently in response
   to small, scattered, and ephemeral food supplies. Sixty-six percent of
   the night roosts were in conifers, 33 \% were in black cottonwood
   (Populus trichocarpa), and one roost (2\%) was in a mixed western
   juniper (Juniperus occidentalis), deciduous tree stand; 62\% of roosts
   were on private land. Non-commercial and unregulated cutting of trees on
   private land is done to expand fields for agriculture, obtain firewood,
   or clear land for subdivision and other purposes, and commercial harvest
   of cottonwoods is becoming economical. Consequently, the potential for
   losing roosts is great, resulting in the possible degredation of
   wintering habitat for bald eagles. We conclude with management
   recommendations for monitoring the bald eagle population and managing
   their foraging and roosting habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and biomass dynamics of earthworms and cocoons in a meadow
   fescue ley (Festuca pratensis Huds.) were monitored by soil coring in
   September 1982 and once a month from June until October 1983. In
   addition, the influence of temperature on cocoon development time and
   cocoon production in Aporrectodea caliginosa Sav. was studied in the
   laboratory. At 15 degrees C, 0.8 - 1.7 cocoons were produced per adult
   and week. Cocoon production was three times lower at 10 degrees C, and
   it was almost zero at 5 degrees C. At 15 degrees C cocoons hatched after
   10-12 weeks, whereas at 10 degrees C they had still not hatched after 16
   weeks. At 15 degrees C two hatchlings per cocoon emerged from 5\% of the
   cocoons. The mean biomass and population density of earthworms was 28.7
   +/- 4.6 g m(-2) and 60.1 +/- 8.2 m(-2) respectively. A. caliginosa was
   the dominant species, accounting for 86\% of the earthworm biomass and
   92\% of the numbers. The majority of the population aestivated in
   August, when the soil temperature was high and the humidity low. It was
   estimated that cocoon production in this species lasted for ca. 120 days
   in 1983. Based on laboratory studies on cocoon production rates at
   various temperatures, as well as on the number of adults in the field
   and climate data, the number of cocoons produced by A. caliginosa was
   estimated at 260 m(-2) year(-1). Assuming all adults were reproductive,
   this corresponded to a production rate of 12 cocoons adult(-1) year(-1).
   However, the high individual cocoon mass indicated that it was mainly
   the larger adults that produced cocoons. The discrepancy between
   predicted numbers of cocoons produced and the actual number of cocoons
   or newly emerged earthworms in the samples is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The acute and chronic toxicities of three benzoylphenyl ureas,
   diflubenzuron, hexaflumuron and teflubenzuron were assessed under
   laboratory conditions against two-day-old second (II) instar Desert
   Locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal) nymphs. Following exposure by
   ingestion of a single precise dose applied to short pieces of spring
   barley, nymphs were monitored for two moults until the fourth (IV)
   instar. Analysis of acute response data gave three significantly
   different LD(50) statistics (P < 0.05), 68.0, 26.6 and 0.71 mu g per
   nymph respectively for diflubenzuron, hexaflumuron and teflubenzuron.
   The probit regression slopes also differed significantly, indicating
   distinct tolerance distributions for the three compounds, the narrowest
   response being to diflubenzuron and the widest range of response being
   to teflubenzuron. The timing of death was found to vary between the
   compounds; most nymphs died during the first moult following treatment
   with either hexaflumuron or teflubenzuron. However, the majority of
   nymphs that died after exposure to diflubenzuron did so after completing
   the first moult after treatment, but before the second. The mean
   development times of nymphs during the II and especially third (III)
   instars were significantly longer (P < 0.05) than those of the controls
   following exposure to diflubenzuron and hexaflumuron. Teflubenzuron had
   no significant effect (P < 0.05) on the duration of the II instar. The
   potential of the three compounds to control S. gregaria populations in
   the field is discussed with particular reference to the timing and
   nature of acute and chronic responses.}},

Abstract = {{Second-instar (II) nymphs of the Desert Locust, Schistocerca gregaria
   (Forsk.) were exposed to three benzoylphenyl ureas (BPUs),
   diflubenzuron, hexaflumuron and teflubenzuron. Nymphs were treated with
   precise doses by allowing them to ingest treated barley leaves at
   varying stages of the II instar. They were exposed to the same total
   quantity of active ingredient over one (Days 1, 2, 3 or 4), two (Days
   1-2, 2-3 or 3-4) or four days (Days 1-4) of the four-day inter-moult
   period. The total amounts applied were 60 mu g per nymph of
   diflubenzuron, 30 mu g per nymph of hexaflumuron or 0.25 mu g per nymph
   of teflubenzuron. The nymphs were then monitored for two moults after
   treatment until they reached the fourth (IV) instar, to observe both the
   acute and chronic effects of treatment. The timing of the exposure
   during the inter-moult period and the duration of exposure were both
   found to result in significantly different acute responses for each BPU.
   Treatment over one or two days showed that the closer to the moult II
   instars were treated, the greater the mortality. This indicated that
   locust pharate cuticle is predominantly synthesised late in the instar.
   Treatment over four days resulted in higher mortality than exposure to
   the same quantity of active ingredient over one or two days, suggesting
   that BPUs are highly toxic to locust nymphs but non-cumulative within
   their bodies. The timing of death was also significantly affected by
   both the timing and duration of treatment. A significant proportion of
   the mortality occurred after the first moult following treatment when
   nymphs were dosed on Day 1 and Day 2 with hexaflumuron and diflubenzuron
   respectively. Mortality following all other treatments occurred during
   the first moult after treatment. The duration of the II and third (III)
   instars were significantly prolonged in many cases following treatment
   with BPUs. The implications of increased mortality following prolonged
   exposure to BPUs and extended development periods are discussed in
   relation to the use of BPUs as barrier-sprayed insecticides for the

Abstract = {{Increased inputs of nutrients into the waters of Lake Okeechobee has
   raised concern that the lake is becoming hypereutrophic. One aspect in
   understanding the overall cycling and dynamics of the nutrients in the
   system is the effect of benthic organisms on solute transport. Various
   diffusional models have been used to approximate the effect of benthic
   organisms on solute transport within sediments using diffusion
   coefficient values which represent the pooled contributions of molecular
   diffusion (D-s) and enhanced solute mixing due to macrobenthos activity
   (D-i). The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of
   benthic activity on solute transport by measuring D-s (i.e., no benthic
   activity) and an apparent-dispersion or mixing coefficient D-m (i.e.,
   with benthic activity) for the four major sediment types of Lake
   Okeechobee, Florida using a reservoir technique. This method involved
   monitoring the depletion of a conservative tracer (tritiated water) from
   the overlying water (reservoir) resulting from transport into sediments
   using disturbed sediments repacked in cores (3.2 cm diam.) and
   undisturbed cores (3.2 to 12 cm diam.) obtained from the lake.
   Additional estimates of D-m and D-s were also obtained by measuring
   tracer concentration profiles in the sediment cores at the end of a
   specified diffusion period. Molecular diffusion coefficients (D-s)
   measured for repacked cores of sand, littoral, mud and peat sediments
   ranged from 0.90 to 1.29 cm(2) d(-1), and estimates of D-s were slightly
   higher in undisturbed cores without benthic organisms. D-m values for
   undisturbed cores of mud, sand and littoral sediments having
   macrobenthic populations ranged from 2.09 to 24.78 cm(2) d(-1); values
   that were 1.6 to 15 times higher than those in sediments without benthic
   activity. Undisturbed cores of varying diameter from mud sediments had
   similar estimates of D-m for tritium; however, the undisturbed cores
   with larger diameters from littoral sediments yielded larger estimates
   of D-m, reflecting the heterogeneity of benthic population densities and
   activity. Therefore, D-s estimates may not adequately represent
   transport processes for mud, sand and littoral sediments of Lake
   Okeechobee; hence careful consideration should be given to the role of
   benthic organisms in the overall transport of solutes across the
   sediment-water interface.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in invertebrate population numbers and composition were
   monitored in six small shallow ephemeral pans during four consecutive
   inundations of spring, summer and autumn 1988/1989. The community was
   generally characterized by crustaceans and was invaded by insect larvae
   in summer. Community changes and succession were prominent in spring but
   less so in summer and autumn. Large pans supported more species than
   small pans. During longer inundation there was less difference between
   the initial and the final population composition than during shorter
   inundation, although the total population density did not increase
   significantly. This indicated that population composition stabilized as
   inundation lengthened. Population changes of six representative taxa
   were not correlated to changes in the physical and chemical
   characteristics of the water.}},

Abstract = {{Xenobiotic residues and their metabolites in biological fluids of the
   general population are an important indicator of exposure to toxic
   substances dispersed in the environment. Urine samples collected from
   124 subjects living in SW Tuscany, Italy were analyzed for
   alkylphosphates (dimethylphosphate, dimethylthiophosphate,
   dimethyldithiophosphate, diethylphosphate, diethylthiophosphate,
   diethyldithiophosphate), aspecific metabolites of organophosphorus
   insecticides. The compound most frequently found was
   dimethylthiophosphate which was detectable in 99\% of the subjects
   analyzed, with a geometric mean of 70.7 nmol/g creatinine. The other
   substances were found in the following percentages of our population, at
   the following mean concentrations: dimethylphosphate, 87\%, 62.8 nmol/g
   creat.; dimethyldithiophosphate, 48\%, 21.1 nmol/g creat.;
   diethylphosphate, 81\%, 27.4 nmol/g creat.; diethylthiophosphate, 73\%,
   22.8 nmol/g creat.; diethyldithiophosphate, 7\%, 13.7 nmol/g creatinine.
   Subjects eating food (fruit, meat, vegetables) that was not their own
   produce showed higher urinary concentrations of nearly all the
   compounds. The other variables considered (sex, age, residence, alcohol,
   smoking, sampling period) seem to affect the percentages of positive
   values of the various substances but to different degrees. Age and
   source of foods were the most important variables for
   dimethylthiophosphate excretion when mean values were analyzed by
   Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA).}},

Abstract = {{For quantitative auditory determination of grasshopper population sizes,
   the diurnal song activity pattern must be known. This activity was
   quantified for 14 grassland species under optimal weather conditions.
   Six different patterns were observed: (1) some species sang almost the
   whole day with a rather constant rate. (2) others increased activity
   towards noon followed by a decrease in the afternoon, the increase and
   decrease being rather symmetrical. (3) a third form showed a rapid
   increase in the morning, followed by a slow decrease from noon to the
   evening. (4) another type also showed a rather symmetrical curve with
   increase in the morning and decrease in the evening, with, however, a
   marked decrease around noon. The extremes were species which showed song
   activity (5) only in the morning or (6) from the evening into the night.
   The composition of the grasshopper community allows a rather detailed
   evaluation of grassland biotopes, taking the well-known ecological
   habitat-binding of the species into account.}},

Abstract = {{Many hypotheses have been advanced for the proximate causes of
   dispersal, and the theoretical consequences of dispersal have been
   investigated from the points of view of both population dynamics and
   genetics. However, the theory has not yet been put convincingly to the
   test because of the lack of suitable methods of measuring and analysing
   dispersal in the wild. Monitoring individuals by capture-recapture
   throughout the range occupied by a subdivided population is a good
   candidate provided that 1) entirely new statistical models for the study
   of natal dispersal are developed, 2) the current models for the study of
   breeding dispersal are substantially improved and 3) spatial models of
   population dynamics currently developed are implemented in user-friendly
   software. Given these prerequisites, bird colonies may be an excellent
   biological model because 1) birds are easily marked when young and 2)
   colonies are clearly separated and often conspicuous so that dispersers
   are identified unequivocally. Moreover, some species present a
   manageably small number of colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Age-specific dispersal and colonization were investigated by monitoring
   the colonization of a set of five newly-created ponds over three years,
   and the age structure of colonizer individuals was compared to the age
   structure in two resident populations by means of skeletochronology.
   Whereas the youngest adult individuals in the resident populations were
   3 years old, most colonizers were 1-2 year-old adult newts. This study
   also shows that older newts participate in the colonization of new
   sites, as well as juveniles. As expected, the sex ratio of the first
   year colonizers was biased in favour of males. Juvenile dispersal
   appears adaptive in the context of metapopulation dynamics with patches
   experiencing rapid ecological succession. Sex-biased dispersal may be
   related to the mating system, and asymmetry in reproductive effort
   between the sexes.}},

Abstract = {{We outline a general method to carry out population viability analyses
   (PVA) by making use of matrix population models. We consider a
   structured population (by age, sex, reproductive status, space, etc.)
   whose demographic parameters are known from field study. To assess the
   extinction risk and define a management program, we advocate a
   three-step PVA: (1) Setting up a constant matrix model that includes the
   mean values of demographic rates. The sizes of each population class are
   linked from one year to the next by a transition matrix that contains
   all vital rates. When these parameters are taken to be constant (fixed
   to their mean), the matrix analysis yields the deterministic population
   growth rate, population structure, stage-specific reproductive values
   and the sensitivities of the growth rate to variations in demographic
   rate. (2) Assessing the extinction risk due to stochastic factors:
   demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity and catastrophes.
   We show how to compute the stochastic growth rate, extinction
   probabilities and the distribution of time to extinction, from
   computations based on the constant matrix model (step 1) together with
   Monte-Carlo simulations. (3) Determining action on demographic
   parameters and amelioration of monitoring programs. The extinction risk
   can be reduced by increasing the population growth rate, decreasing its
   temporal variability or boosting current population size. Which
   parameters should be fine-tuned in order to cause the largest increase
   in population growth can be found out by computing the growth rate
   elasticities to demographic rates. Furthermore, variance in population
   growth can be decomposed into that produced by mean parameter values,
   and that produced by fluctuations in parameters. Finally, reproductive
   values and their sensitivities indicate which classes should be
   reinforced to obtain a long-lasting raise of population size.
   The ULM software allows one to apply this agenda automatically to any
   particular case study. The software can be conveniently used to model
   populations with any kind of life cycle. The user will enter the model
   by making use of a friendly, simplified programming language that leaves
   him or her entirely free to decide of the matrix structure, parameter
   values and factors of parameter variations (stochastic factors,
   density-dependence...). All PVA-related parameters mentioned above
   (growth rate, sensitivities, elasticities, extinction probabilities,
   distribution of extinction time, etc.) are computed by the software.
   Here this is illustrated with an overview of two case studies, that of a
   natural, declining population of snakes (Vipera ursinii ursinii) and
   that of a reintroduced, growing population of raptors (Gyps fulvus
   fulvus).}},

Abstract = {{The status of amphibian populations is relatively unknown in the boreal
   mixedwoods of Ontario. The present study focuses on two objectives in
   the context of the Black Sturgeon Boreal Mixedwood Research Project in
   northwestern Ontario. The first is to evaluate the salamander
   populations as potential bioindicators of the impact of forestry
   practices on forest soils. The second focuses on the impact of
   harvesting treatments on frog reproduction. Spruce slabs set as cover
   boards during the summer of 1994 have been verified for the presence of
   salamanders from June to August 1995. No salamanders were found under

Abstract = {{Survival rates of 72 radio-collared moose (Alces alces shirasi) (42
   females and 30 males), > 6 months of age when captured in northcentral
   Colorado, were measured from 1992 through 1995. Individual animals were
   monitored for up to 4 yrs. Forty-seven radio-collared moose, including
   28 females and 19 males, died during the study. Mortality causes and
   proportion of deaths included legal harvest (76\%), illegal kill (15\%),
   auto collisions (2\%), and other causes (7\%). Annual survival estimates
   {[}proportion alive at yr's end excluding fate unknown (unexplained
   signal loss), legal, and illegal harvest] for all age and sex categories
   combined were, 0.95, 1.00, 0.94 and 1.00 for 1992 - 1995, respectively.
   A 95\% confidence interval for the non-hunting related, pooled survival
   rate was 0.967 +/- 0.031. High non-hunting related survival rates
   suggest that managed sport hunting is the most viable method for
   maintaining the Colorado moose population in balance with available
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The Alaska Legislature recently passed a law directing the Alaska Board
   of Game to identify certain game populations that will be managed
   intensively. This mandate implies management for maximum sustained yield
   (MSY), yet managing populations for MSY is problematic. Overharvest at
   MSY may cause populations to decrease to low levels, and in the presence
   of predation low-density equilibria can be established. We recommend
   maintaining intensively managed populations at densities above the
   actual point of MSY to avoid potential over-harvests caused by
   stochastic variation in recruitment. Managing intensively will require
   better information on factors that influence recruitment and
   corresponding rates of increase in moose populations, including: age at
   first reproduction; rates of pregnancy, twinning, age-specific survival,
   dispersal, and predation; as well as population sex ratios. population
   modeling indicates that rate of increase is most sensitive to changes in
   adult survival, but under most circumstances in real moose populations,
   calf survival is very important. Factors affecting calf survival include
   habitat quality, weather, and predation, and the effects of these
   factors can be minimized by maintaining moose densities slightly above
   those which maximize recruitment. An intensive management strategy for
   moose populations in Alaska must include the ability to implement cow
   harvests, predator management, and habitat management. Aggressive
   monitoring of population parameters, cause-specific mortality rates,
   trends in habitat quality, and a knowledge of carrying capacity will be
   essential to selecting appropriate management strategies. Gaining this
   information will be expensive but the alternative is potential
   mismanagement and the risk of population declines.}},

Abstract = {{By using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling coupled
   with Monte Carte simulation,the interindividual variability in the
   concentrations of chemicals in a worker's exhaled breath and urine were
   estimated and compared with existing biological exposure indices (BEIs).
   The PBPK model simulated an exposure regimen similar to a typical
   workday, while exposure concentrations were set to equal the ambient
   threshold limit values (TLV(R)s) of six industrial solvents (benzene,
   chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, methyl chloroform,
   and trichloroethylene). Based on model predictions incorporating
   interindividual variability, the percentage of population protected was
   derived using TLVs as the basis for worker protection. Results showed
   that current BEIs may not protect the majority or all of the workers in
   an occupational setting. For instance, current end-expired air indices
   for benzene and methyl chloroform protect 95\% and less than 10\% of the
   worker population, respectively. Urinary metabolite concentrations for
   benzene, methyl chloroform, and trichloroethylene were also estimated.
   The current BEI recommendation for phenol metabolite concentration at
   the end-of-shift sampling interval was estimated to protect 68\% of the
   worker population, while trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) and
   trichloroethanol (TCOH) concentrations for methyl chloroform exposure
   were estimated to protect 54\% and 97\%, respectively. The recommended
   concentration of TCAA in urine as a determinant of trichloroethylene
   exposure protects an estimated 84\% of the workers. Although many of the
   existing BEIs considered appear to protect a majority of the worker
   population, an inconsistent proportion of the population is protected.
   The information presented in this study may provide a new approach for
   administrative decisions establishing BEIs and allow uniform application
   of biological monitoring among different chemicals.}},

   Evidence from a thirteen-year study of a marked population}},

Abstract = {{We monitored a population of four to seven groups of individually marked
   saddle-back tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis; Callitrichidae) at the Cocha
   Cashu Biological Station in Peru's Manu National Park every year from
   1979 through 1992. In this paper we use data on life histories, group
   compositions, group formations, and dispersal patterns collected during
   these 13 years to examine the reproductive strategies of males and
   females. Group compositions and mating patterns were quite variable in
   this population, with both monogamy and cooperative polyandry common. In
   polyandrous groups, two males shared a female's copulations and
   cooperatively cared for her young. Although most groups contained a
   single breeding female, we recorded four cases in which secondary
   females successfully reared young. Most young females appeared to wait
   in their natal groups for the first opportunity to fill a primary
   breeding position in their own or a neighboring group. Females that
   acquired primary breeding positions maintained those positions for a
   mean of 3 years. No female was observed to transfer between groups a
   second time. Variation in female lifetime reproductive success was high.
   Half of the females marked as juveniles never bred; the other half
   produced an average of 3.5 young. A paucity of female breeding
   opportunities may explain the high mortality of females between 2.5 and
   4.5 years of age and the resulting male-biased adult sex ratio. The
   majority of groups contained more than one probable male breeder.
   Polyandrous groups included both related and unrelated males. Behavioral
   differences between Cocha Cashu tamarins and other studied populations
   may result from the pressures of living in an environment inhabited by
   nine other primate species and numerous predators. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Since 1990, populations of carabid beetles are continuously monitored in
   five coastal dune habitats in Belgium, situated along a transect from
   seaside marram dunes to inland moss dunes. In five complete year cycles
   about 14 000 carabids belonging to 76 species have been obtained. At
   most 50\% of the species are continuously present in reproducing
   populations. The remaining species are only rarely caught, mostly
   outside of their normal reproductive season, and thus are presumably
   non-residents or vagrants. Furthermore, observations on wing and flight
   muscle development and on possible source areas support the hypothesis
   of accidental immigration rather than of local populations passing
   through bottlenecks. Many well-established and typical dune indicator
   species show strong fluctuations in their population dynamics,
   significantly concordant between different sampling stations and largely
   explained by climatological variables, either directly or indirectly.
   This study shows that the use of terrestrial invertebrates as
   bio-indicators in conservation ecology requires a population level
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Urinary hippuric acid, phenol, and o-cresol, which are biomarkers for
   toluene, benzene, and phenol exposures, are usually present in a
   significant amount in urine collected from subjects who have not been
   occupationally exposed to the organic solvents. With the improvement of
   working enviroments, the urinary concentrations of the biomarkers have
   become lower and closer to the levels of urine from unexposed subjects.
   It is very useful to clarify the background levels of these biomarkers
   and the factors which effect the background levels of the biomarkers in
   order to make effective use of biological monitoring under low level
   exposure. In the present study, the effects of life habits and the
   genetic polymorphisms of the metabolizing enzymes on the background
   levels of urinary hippuric acid, phenol and o- and p-cresol were
   clarified, using 351 males (means age: 38.6, range: 19-71) who were not
   occupationally exposed to hazardous chemical materials. Their life
   habits, smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary habits were examined
   by means of a questionnaire. The genotypes of five metabolizing enzymes,
   that is, low Km aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2), polymorphic N-acetyl
   transferase (NAT2), cytochrome P-4501A1 (CYP1A1), cytochrome P-4502E1
   (CYP2E1), and glutathione-S-transferase mu (GSTM1) were determined form
   peripheral blood samples. The urinary hippuric acid and creatinine were
   analyzed by HPLC and urinary phenol, o-, p- and m-cresol were determined
   by GC/MS. Recoveries and the coefficients of variance of phenol,
   o-cresol, and p-cresol ranged from 92.7 to 107.8\% and 1.3\% to 6.7\%,
   respectively. Linear relationships between the concentrations of phenol,
   o- and p-cresol, and their peak area ratios were observed. As results,
   with advancing age, alcohol consumption increased, and the intake of
   greasy food, coffee, and tea was reduced. Smoking, alcohol consumption,
   and coffee and tea consumption were associated with each other. ALDH2
   polymorphism was significantly associated with alcohol consumption and
   coffee and tea consumption, however, NAT2, CYP1A1, GSTM1, and CYP2E1
   polymorphisms did not correlate with any of the smoking, alcohol
   consumption, and dietary habits. From a multiple regression analysis,
   the background level of urinary hippuric acid reduced according to
   alcohol consumption. Urinary phenol concentration was reduced by coffee
   and tea intake, and o-cresol concentration increased with the number of
   smoked cigarettes. No genetic polymorphisms of the five metabolizing
   enzymes were related to the urinary background levels of hippuric acid,
   phenol, o- and p-cresols.}},

Abstract = {{Absenteeism among 161 Dutch forestry workers was investigated in a
   cohort study. The rate of taking sick leave was related to the
   concentrations of sulfate and ozone in ambient air, the air temperature,
   and the relative humidity. The incidence of absenteeism was treated as a
   Poisson process, with the size of population at risk as the offset
   factor and with the environmental monitoring data as hazard factors.
   There appeared to be some overdispersion; therefore, in a second
   analysis the incidence of absenteeism was also treated as a negative
   binomial outcome. With the exception of a separate overdispersion
   parameter in the negative binomial approach, both methods yielded
   approximately the same results. Although no significant association was
   found between absence rate and the measured ambient-air-quality data,
   there appeared to be a time lag of 3 d between a peak in temperature and
   1 d in absenteeism.}},

Abstract = {{The author's mutual validation of the IMPROVE measures of light
   absorption-the light absorption coefficient sigma(a) and the TOR carbon
   measures-at remote sites in the western United States, has identified
   more light-absorbing carbon (LAC) than the current interpretation of TOR
   admits. Further comparison of sigma(a) with the new determination of LAC
   allows us to identify fine soil as the remaining significant contributor
   to light absorption at these remote sites, and thus to fully reconstruct
   sigma(a) there. This reconstruction also confirms the accuracy of the
   blank corrections to the carbon measurements. Using sigma(a) or the new
   reconstruction of it given herein as the appropriate measure of light
   absorption allows more correct reconstructions of aerosol light
   extinction sigma(e) and of organic mass; the latter provides evidence
   that the newly identified LAC is also essentially elemental carbon (EC).
   The new interpretation of the TOR carbons for the remote western sites
   also reveals apparently much less pyrolysis than previously thought
   occurring during TOR analysis, for most of the aerosol samples collected
   at these sites. A very small minority population, comprising less than
   5\% of the samples and occurring mostly in the summer and autumn, is
   also identified, containing a larger proportion of supposed pyrolyzable
   organics. The differences in apparent makeup between the two populations
   strongly suggest that the majority population represents a widespread
   background of aerosol light absorption which averages 5 Mm(-1) and is
   probably due primarily to diesel fuel emissions transported from urban
   areas and highways, while the minority population is probably due to
   wood fires. A number of possible explanations are offered for why the
   newly identified EC is not currently recognized in the TOR analysis. In
   particular, it is claimed that sample darkening during thermal analysis
   is not a reliable quantitative indication of pyrolyzable organics,
   particularly in the remote aerosols considered; and that optical
   monitoring of the sample during thermal analysis should be corrected for
   expected strong multiple scattering effects, as the IMPROVE measurement
   of sigma(a) is already corrected. It is also hypothesized that internal
   mixing of some EC with an oxygen-containing species, most probably
   sulfate, during aerosol transport is the source of the oxygen that
   allows some of the EC to evolve at a lower temperature in TOR analysis
   than previously thought, and in a pure helium atmosphere. Further tests
   are suggested to confirm the new interpretations offered here. The
   primary importance of the present results, besides unifying a number of
   IMPROVE analyses and removing major discrepancies in the data, is to
   highlight what the author believes are the two most important
   measurement problems in aerosol research today: (1) the failure to
   recognize and eliminate multiple scattering effects in the optical
   measurement of light absorption and in optical monitoring of a sample
   during thermal carbon analysis; and (2) the failure to accurately
   distinguish between light absorbing and non-light-absorbing carbons in
   thermal analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) nest in few colonies in the
   northeastern United Slates, and the population is listed as endangered.
   We compare reproductive success from 1987 through 1990 at Cedar Beach,
   Long Island, and in 1980 and 1987 through 1990 at Bird Island,
   Massachusetts, to examine yearly and seasonal differences. Productivity
   was highest for terns breeding in the first six days of the egg-laying
   period and decreased thereafter. Clutch size, hatching success, and
   productivity declined significantly during the season, with some
   variations in pattern among years and between colony sites. Pairs
   initiating nests after 22 June fledged almost no young. Patterns of
   reproductive success were more irregular at the smaller colony (Cedar
   Beach) than the larger colony. Reproductive success was related to age
   of adults; young birds (two to three years old) had lower clutch sizes,
   had lower reproductive success, and laid later than older birds. The
   effective reproductive population of the colony included primarily birds
   that bred in the early and peak periods; thus, monitoring reproductive
   success only from early or peak nests overestimates overall reproductive
   success. Selection against even earlier breeding in this species may be
   due to lower food resources early in the season and higher predation
   rates on early nests.}},

Abstract = {{A species may be considered threatened if it (1) is represented by one
   or a few stable but small populations, or (2) was formerly widespread or
   abundant but is now in decline. In the first case, it may not be
   appropriate to attempt recovery of the species if it has not declined;
   monitoring and perhaps captive breeding should be the only management
   needed. In the second case, research is important to identify the
   processes causing population decline and to ensure that management for
   recovery is informed and effective. A rigorous scientific methodology is
   advocated to identify causes of declines and is applied in case studies
   of the Lord Howe Island Woodhen and a small dasyurid marsupial, the
   Mulgara. Four steps are involved: (1) establish the magnitude and rate
   of population decline, and list possible explanations for it
   (observations); (2) identify the most plausible threatening process or
   processes that may de causing the decline (model); (3) derive
   predictions from the models (hypothesis); and (4) lest critically, using
   null hypotheses, whether the putative threatening processes identified
   in the second step are causing the observed population decline, by using
   mensurative or manipulative experiments. When one or more processes
   causing population decline have been identified, management should be
   initiated to alleviate them and subsequent population changes monitored.
   It is proposed further that scientific methodology be used to identify
   effective management techniques, evaluate contentious practices, and
   guide reintroduction programs. I discuss objections that science is
   sometimes irrelevant for recovery of threatened species, and propose
   that strengthened links between research and management would increase
   the effectiveness of recovery planning.}},

Abstract = {{The endangered plane Grevillea caleyi (Proteaceae) occurs in bushland
   that is adjacent to urban areas in the Sydney region. Within these
   areas, repeated and frequent fire threatens nor only the endangered
   flora bur life and property as well. These threats were well illustrated
   by the impact of the fires that occurred in January 1994 in Sydney
   Management of urban fire-prone areas needs to identify those fire
   regimes likely to drive the endangered flora to extinction, as well as
   identifying if any populations of endangered flora occur in locations
   that pose a fire hazard for the protection of life and property.
   Research into the population dynamics of G. caleyi, as part of the
   development of a recovery plan for the species, indicates that a regime
   of frequent fire will lead to local population declines and extinction.
   Consequently, burning on a frequent basis for hazard reduction to
   protect property assets in the vicinity of G. caleyi is inappropriate
   for the conservation of this plant. Instead, a minimum fire-free
   interval of 8-12 years is recommended for the conservation of G. caleyi
   Additionally, areas unburnt for 20-25 years should be monitored for
   adult plant survival and seedling recruitment. If all or most adults
   have died and there is no seedling recruitment then consideration should
   be given to burning such sites.}},

   Study of a sample of parks indicates that the most frequent threats to

   parks bg the various factors. The causes of inadequate or inappropriate

   information, 3. shortages of resources, and 4. the lack of targeted
   funding. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)
   `'Threatened Plant Population Database'' has been developed to
   facilitate information access. The use of volunteers to assist in
   threatened species management needs to be further encouraged and
   co-ordinated. The South Australian park system does not adequately

   acquisition or negotiation is needed to protect viable populations of
   each species in parks or Heritage Agreement areas.}},

   influence ecological processes in forest canopies, soils, and water

   The macroecology and collective environmental requirements of all 15 bat

Abstract = {{Surveys of night roosts in anthropogenic features, particularly concrete
   bridges, offer an efficient, but species-selective method for examining
   the bat community in forested landscapes. In the upper Sacramento River
   canyon some species (Antrozous pallidus, Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis
   volans, Corynorhinus townsendii) were captured more frequently per
   person-hour of sampling in night roosts than by mist netting over water,
   while others (e.g., Myotis californicus, Myotis ciliolabrum, Lasiurus
   sp., Lasionycteris noctivagans, Euderma maculatum) never used these
   sites. Protected, but open-bridge night roosts remain warmer than
   ambient through most of the night over the summer. Recaptures of Myotis
   yumanensis and small numbers of A. pallidus, E. fuscus, and M. volans
   indicated fidelity to night roosts through four years of survey. Capture
   at aggregated night roosts permits long-term monitoring without
   disturbance to maternity roosts. For species that roost in trees by day,
   particularly in areas of timber harvest, bridge night roosts may persist
   longer than day roosts, and offer continuing access to marked
   populations that switch among day roosts.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored bat activity using Anabat II bat-detector systems in three
   riparian areas that had partially been clear-cut logged in western
   Oregon. Total bat activity averaged 4.1 to 7.7 times higher in wooded
   areas than in adjacent logged areas. activity in wooded areas was almost
   exclusively Myotis species; non-Myotis species, especially Lasionycteris
   noctivagans, accounted for a substantial amount of the activity in
   logged habitats. Different levels of activity between the habitat types
   could be the result of differences in infect prey populations in the two
   habitats. More Lepidopterans, more large-bodied insects, and fewer
   small-bodied insects were captured in the wooded habitat than in the
   logged habitat. Differences in bat-community composition in the two
   habitats could be due to differences in the morphology and echolocation
   call structure of the bat species. Other hypotheses that might explain
   differences in activity include differences in risk of predation,
   competitive interactions, or behavioural or evolutionary constraints,
   Our findings indicate that forest-management activities in riparian
   areas can influence patterns of habitat use by bats.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides monitoring and spatial analysis of forest
   fragmentation based on high-resolution remote sensing, in order to give
   a framework for assessing residual biodiversity in the Guiglo-Tai
   region. Massive deforestation has taken place, mainly in the last 20
   years, 79\% of unprotected forests have been eliminated on the 100 X 100
   km study area. Deforestation is also beginning to encroach on protected
   areas. Forest fragments are mainly found close to the deforestation
   front. In areas which were first deforested, forest fragments are very
   scarce and are restricted to less productive soils; they are often
   severely degraded. Young secondary forests develop on abandoned fields,
   but primary forest regeneration seems unlikely in light of the distance
   from seed sources and the increase in population pressure. Conservation
   initiatives in this zone of high biodiversity should focus on protected
   areas, taking into account short and long term benefits for the local
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The loss of species from a system will lead to changes in ecosystem
   structure, energetics and processes. Consequently, the changes in
   abundance and in particular the presence or absence of species from
   areas where they would normally be expected to occur should be the final
   measure of the biological impact of a pollutant. If such studies are to
   be useful for monitoring pollutant impact, the techniques should be
   simple and relatively quick to undertake. The number of taxa that can be
   incorporated into such studies may be limited to reduce time demands.
   Suitable indicator taxa should conform as closely as possible to the
   seven criteria outlined by Pearson which are described in this paper.
   Three taxa of terrestrial macro-invertebrates that appear to fit these
   criteria are oligochaeta, aranaea and isopods. Surveys of
   macro-invertebrate community structure were undertaken at sites
   contaminated with cadmium, copper, lead and zinc, situated around a
   smelting works. Results indicate that community sensitivity can vary
   considerably between taxa. Earthworms were relatively sensitive to
   metals, whilst no deleterious effect on the total catch, number of
   species or diversity of spiders was detected. As a consequence of the
   differential sensitivities existing between taxa, community resilience
   for any given group should not necessarily be regarded as evidence of
   ecosystem health. A broader based scheme developed with acknowledgement
   to RIVPACS offers a more suitable basis for assessing pollutant induced
   changes at the community level.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored survival, reproduction and emigration of a translocated
   beaver Castor fiber population in the Netherlands for five years and
   used a stochastic model to assess its viability. Between 1988 and 1991,
   42 beavers were released in the Biesbosch National Park. The mortality
   was initially high but gradually fell to normal rates. However, the
   breeding success was low, and we hypothesized that this was either a
   temporary phenomenon (the translocation hypothesis) or a permanent
   feature (the poor habitat hypothesis). According to the computer
   simulations, the isolated population was viable under the first but not
   under the second hypothesis. In the latter case, the prospects generally
   improved by the foundation of another population in the Gelderse Poort
   (100 km from the Biesbosch), However, this second habitat should be
   optimal for beavers in order to reduce the extinction probability of the
   Biesbosch population to below 10\% in 100 years,' the loss of genetic
   variability (1-2\% per generation) was just above the applied tolerable
   risk (1\%), but the effects of inbreeding are unknown in beavers. We
   conclude that the beaver population in the Biesbosch is not viable
   unless the reproductive success increases, either in the Biesbosch
   itself or in a nearby population. We recommend applying such viability
   analyses to evaluate the likely success of any translocation.}},

Abstract = {{There is concern in Britain about damage to nature conservation from
   expanding populations of the non-native muntjac deer Muntiacus reevesi.
   In Monks Wood National Nature Reserve, muntjac attained a sufficiently
   high population by 1985 for significant damage to coppice regrowth to
   result. Electric fences have been used since 1988 to protect sensitive
   areas. Observations on regrowth of ash Fraxinus excelsior showed that
   while damage inside fences was significantly reduced when compared with
   areas outside, the fences sometimes failed to provide adequate
   protection. Observations on all coppice areas fenced since 1988 revealed
   that the extent of canopy formation was positively related to the
   density of surviving stools and to the area of adjacent rides.
   Improvements are suggested for fence design and the siting of coppiced
   areas. Techniques are outlined for monitoring contemporary damage, for
   evaluating damage retrospectively and for assessing abundance of muntjac
   in order to predict the amount of damage they may cause.}},

Abstract = {{Residues of lead and chlorinated insecticides in human breast milk of
   120 Egyptian women representing 20 different governorates (provinces)
   throughout Egypt were determined. The mean values of lead in rural areas
   and small cities were significantly lower than those in industrial and
   highly populated cities. Higher levels of lead in mother's human milk
   from Cairo, Alexandria and Assiut may be attributed to heavy automobile
   traffic and the use of leaded gasoline in addition to the use of lead
   water pipe lines in these areas. On the other hand, the most abundant
   residues of organochlorine pesticides and their metabolits found in
   mother's milk were p,p'-DDE and lindane. Endosulfan I, and p,p'-DDT
   residues were detected in some samples, but aldrin and endrin were not
   detected in most of the samples. The mean values for p,p'-DDE, lindane,
   endosulfan I and p,p'-DDT levels in the milk samples of the 20
   governorates studied were 21.37 ppb, 8.42 ppb, 4.84 ppb and 2.93 ppb
   respectively, which are lower than the levels previously reported in
   some of the developed countries. Relatively higher levels of
   organochlorine insecticide residues were recorded in the samples from
   intensive agricultural activity regions. The results showed that
   population living in large cities have higher levels of lead but lower
   levels of pesticide residues while those living in rural areas have
   lower levels of lead and higher levels of pesticides suggesting that
   levels of pollutants in human milk may serve as a good biomarker for
   body burden exposure.}},

   into the crop. At the same time, insect numbers within the crop were
   assessed on a transect across the field by beating the tops of a random
   selection of plants into a tray. Crop growth stage and weather data were

   early spring, could provide advanced warning of the main migration of
   seed weevils to oilseed rape, and showed that establishment of
   measurable numbers of pollen beetles within the crop was occurring

Abstract = {{Isolates of Septoria tritici collected annually from:field crops located

   the degree of sensitivity to prochloraz, propiconazole, triadimenol,
   flutriafol, tebuconazole and cyproconazole at a range of concentrations
   invitro. Preliminary analysis indicated that propiconazole and
   prochloraz were the most effective fungicides against isolates of S.
   tritici in vitro. Triadimenol was the least effective whilst
   tebuconazole, cyproconazole and flutriafol were intermediate in their
   effectiveness. For populations tested, there appears to have been a
   shift towards a reduction in sensitivity to triadimenol since 1992. A
   shift in sensitivity was also recorded for flutriafol but to a lesser
   extent than for triadimenol. Reactions to propiconazole and prochloraz
   were relatively consistent, although results in 1995 showed possible
   progress towards a reduction in sensitivity. Populations showed
   consistent responses to tebuconazole and cyproconazole in 1994 and 1995.
   Overall, isolates in 1995 showed a greater diversity in sensitivity and
   therefore a higher potential for growth in the presence of fungicide
   than in previous years. Possible implications of these results are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The sweetpotato or cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, is nowadays one of
   the most important homopteran pests on a variety of field and greenhouse
   crops. Imidacloprid, the first chloronicotinyl insecticide launched
   world-wide, is meanwhile registered in over 60 countries and shows
   excellent efficacy against a wide range of pest insects. It controls
   homopteran pests such as B. tabaci both by contact and, because of its
   systemic activity, by feeding. The efficacy of imidacloprid was
   investigated in adult leaf-dip bioassays, egg/larval-dip bioassays,
   systemic bioassays and a feeding bioassay on artificial double membranes
   (sachet-test). Whitefly populations from Almeria, Spain, showed a slight
   tolerance (2 to 5-fold) to imidacloprid compared to a reference
   laboratory strain in all bioassays used. A representative of the
   recently described Bemisia B-strains from cotton in California showed
   the same susceptibility to imidacloprid as the reference strain. Other
   insecticides tested were buprofezin, endosulfan, monocrotophos and
   pymetrozin, however, the highest resistance factors were determined for
   endosulfan and monocrotophos. Field trials in Almeria which were carried
   out between 1988 and 1996 have revealed no decline in the field
   performance of imidacloprid against B. tabaci in greenhouse vegetables
   to date.}},

Abstract = {{The Asian red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus was first
   discovered in north-eastern Egypt in 1992 and has now become established
   as a primary pest of date palm in Egypt. Sizeable cavities are created
   in stem tissue by larval tunnelling, in which multiple generations may
   be completed. Even in advanced stages of infestation visible signs of
   stress are few and infestations are usually located by detection of exit
   holes.
   Experiments examined the use of pheromone/food traps to determine
   seasonal variation of the abundance of adult R. ferrugineus and the
   effectiveness of traps for monitoring populations. Pheromone/food traps
   were strapped to date palms 3 metres above ground to prevent vandalism
   and to be above off-shoots. Many more adult weevils were captured during
   the warmer summer months than during the cooler winter months. The
   threshold for R. ferrugineus was found to be in the range 12-14 degrees
   C with very low numbers of weevils being captured in December and
   January the only months in which the average daily temperature fell
   below 14 degrees C.
   Captures rates were highest in the months of April, May and June, which
   corresponds to the onset of warmer weather in Egypt. The higher capture
   rates during this period are probably due to the emergence of broods
   whose development was slowed by the cooler winter months. Twice as many
   female as male weevils were caught.}},

   plants on Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, Arizona. Plant size controlled the
   number of flowers initiated each spring. The proportion of flowers that
   developed (i.e., did not abort) was perhaps determined by
   December-February rainfall in the months before bloom, with more being
   developed in the wettest years. Models based on different ratios of
   initiated cladodes to initiated flowers demonstrated that continued high
   investment in flowers and fruits would eventually terminate reproduction
   altogether; therefore periods of high sexual reproduction should
   alternate with periods of high vegetative growth. In the first 3 years
   of this study, the ratio of new cladodes to initiated flowers was low,
   showing a high investment in sexual reproduction. As suggested by the
   model, the population recouped this investment in the fourth year, when
   the number of new cladodes was nearly 3 times the 1992-1993 mean, and
   the number of initiated flowers was only 73\%= of the 3-year mean.}},

   predation by crabs and starfish was estimated to have killed about one
   half of the seeded population. The rate of loss decreased markedly over
   the following winter and spring. Dispersion of seeded animals increased
   again through summer and autumn, producing a final scallop density of
   about 2 m(-2) (twice that of the natural population), covering more than
   3500 m(2) of seabed. This expansion was accompanied by little further
   mortality, and the final estimate of survivors in the expanded survey
   area was 40\%. Scallop displacement was directional, but the mean vector
   did not match that of the dominant, near-bed water currents. The average
   growth (shell height increment) of surviving scallops was 35 mm in 13
   months. Our results demonstrate the potential for ecologically viable
   bottom culture of the species in coastal Nova Scotia.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean Sea is the largest partially enclosed sea in the world
   and provides habitat to more than 100 species of waterbirds from the
   Palearctic-North African-Middle Eastern regions. Even though the
   Mediterranean suffers from pollution, has little tidal influence, and is
   oligotrophic, more than half of the western Palearctic populations of
   numerous waterfowl species winter in the region. Thirty-three species of
   colonial waterbirds breed along the 46,000 km Mediterranean coastline
   with nine species considered threatened or endangered, mostly because of
   wetland loss and degradation. The long history of human activity and
   scientific investigations in the region has taught some valuable
   lessons. In the area of colonial waterbird biology and conservation, we
   have learned important lessons about the value of long-term monitoring
   and research on selected populations. From marking studies of Greater
   Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus) and Little Egrets (Egretta
   garzetta) results have been used to derive useful information about
   metapopulation dynamics. Involvement of both African and European
   biologists allowed year-round studies of these species that yielded
   valuable spin-offs for training in avian and wetland conservation. We
   have also learned the value of man-made wetlands as feeding and nesting
   sites for some colonial waterbirds. Careful evaluations of the habitat
   quality of different types of wetlands are required, as in contaminant
   levels such as lead shot and pesticides. Wetland conservationists have
   also learned from some instructive mistakes. Dam construction from the
   past have largely ignored impacts on wetlands and wildlife. In some
   areas, economic ventures such as aquaculture operations and salt mining
   have not involved waterbird habitat needs in their planning. Research
   and conservation needs include: (1) establishing regional monitoring
   programs and data banks for seabirds, wading birds, ducks, and geese;
   (2) implementing a wetland inventory for many countries with little
   quantitative data on wetlands; (3) improving habitat quality
   assessments; (4) improving relationships with industry, the private
   citizenry, and government officials to further an appreciation for the
   value of wetlands and waterbirds; (5) enhancing training efforts,
   especially in underdeveloped countries; (6) evaluating the effects of
   hunting and other disturbances to nesting and feeding waterbirds in
   different regions; (7) setting up `'sister-reserve'' (twinned) sites in
   Europe and Africa to foster international linkages and training; and (8)
   fostering local-regional conservation programs to preserve reed beds,
   wet woodlots, and other key habitats.}},

Abstract = {{We summarize the history of waterbird research in the Mediterranean
   region, how some of these activities developed into long-term ecological
   research programs, and how they created awareness of the need to
   conserve the species and their wetland habitats. We further analyze the
   impact of colonial waterbird studies on conservation actions and
   recommend how current research can be made relevant for conservation.
   An overview is presented of the development of mid-winter counts and
   wetland site inventories, and the contribution of ecological studies to
   the conservation of colonial waterbirds and their habitats is
   summarized. There is still a lack of information on the distribution of
   the breeding colonies throughout the Mediterranean and of a coordinated
   population monitoring program. Data on feeding habitat and colony site
   requirements help to recognize those parts of the aquatic ecosystem that
   ought to be given conservation priority. The study of reproductive
   biology adds complementary data on the dependence of reproductive
   performance on environmental conditions. Ultimately, the identification
   of the environmental factors that influence population size is a key
   requirement for species conservation programs. This requires long-term
   studies. However, due to the infrastructure and long-term commitment
   involved, population studies expanding over decades have remained very
   few.
   To make the important investments in the study of colonial waterbird
   ecology more applicable to the conservation, management and restoration
   of their wetland habitats in the future, the collection of baseline
   monitoring data is required throughout the Mediterranean. Successfully
   tested ecological research methods need to be adopted in different parts
   of the Mediterranean and used in a coordinated way. Foraging ecology,
   ecotoxicology and the study of habitat requirements in relation to
   population dynamics are the research fields than can provide useful
   information for site-specific habitat management and restoration
   programs. Interdisciplinary projects between ecologists, hydraulic
   engineers, and land-use planners need to be developed. Finally, the
   results of the scientific studies need to be disseminated more widely,
   also in a form accessible to the administrator, political
   decision-maker, and local inhabitant of a wetland area.}},

Abstract = {{Wintering Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were
   censused at all identified night roost sites in the Delta Region of
   Mississippi during the winters of 1991-92 and 1992-93 using aerial
   surveys and systematic ground surveys in mid-December, mid-February and
   the end of March. Aerial surveys of primary river drainages were
   particularly useful in locating previously unidentified roost sites and
   aerial counts were highly correlated with ground counts of the same
   sites taken within eight days of each other. Despite an increase in
   monitoring effort and shifts in populations due to human disturbance,
   there were no significant differences detected in cormorant populations
   wintering in this region over the past four years. However, mid-February
   counts were significantly higher than either December or March counts
   and numbered approximately 30,000+/-2,000 individuals. Although up to 34
   sites have been monitored to conduct these censuses, only between six
   and twelve sites were active (having >100 birds) at any one time.
   Although these are not always the same sites, six had a significantly
   higher frequency of occupancy than others, and lack of occupancy of
   these primary sites appeared to be associated with the occupancy of
   nearby alternative sites.}},

Abstract = {{The Dnestr Delta, situated on the northwest coast of the Black Sea,
   supports internationally important breeding populations of Great
   Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo), herons and egrets (Ardeidae) and
   Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus). In addition, small numbers of the
   vulnerable Pygmy Cormorant (Phalocrocorax pygmeus) also nest. Eight
   colonial species are regular breeders in the delta, the Black-crowned
   Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and the Great Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax carbo) being the most numerous. These colonies have been
   monitored for the past 22 years (1972-1993). During this period the
   total number of breeding pairs of all eight species varied between 2,700
   to 4,800. The hydrology of the delta is a key determinant of
   fluctuations in the breeding populations. Numbers of breeding herons,
   egrets and ibises tend to increase with high river discharge. The great
   majority of the colonies are located in the central floodplain of the
   delta. Those situated in the upper part of the delta, where the water
   level sometimes reaches a height of 2 m, are in high trees. In the much
   wider, central part, where flooding is less intensive, the birds nest in
   the low willows (Salix cinerea) and sometimes in reedbeds (Phragmites
   australis). The extensive reedbeds in the lower part near the coast are
   major nesting habitats for Great Egrets (Casmerodius albus) and Purple
   Herons (Ardea purpurea).}},

Abstract = {{The breeding population of the Bonin Petrel (Pterodroma hypoleuca) on
   Midway Atoll has declined dramatically since the accidental introduction
   of the black rat (Rattus rattus). During 1993 and 1994, we examined the
   effects of rat predation on Bonin Petrel reproductive success by
   monitoring nesting petrels in six study sites, three of which were
   treated dth rodenticide (treatment) and three that were not (control).
   Results indicate that the incubation stage of the petrels' nesting cycle
   is most vulnerable to rat predation. Both unattended and incubated eggs
   were attacked by rats. Rat predation was not observed on petrel chicks
   in study nests. However, incidental observations of chick remains
   outside of burrows suggest that rat predation on chicks may occur, but
   at a low frequency. Sites with low burrow density suffered more from rat
   predation than sites with higher burrow density. The rodenticide
   `'Vengeance(TM)'' appeared to successfully suppress the rat numbers in
   treated sites. The number of nests that failed due to rat predation was
   significantly lower in two of the three treatment sites when compared
   with their paired control sites. In addition, the indications of rat
   activity were lower at these two treatment sites than at the paired
   control sites. Therefore, this study provides some evidence that
   rodenticide application is success fur in reducing the number of rats,
   which in turn reduces the amount of rat predation and is associated with
   an increase in the reproductive success of Bonin Petrels.}},

Abstract = {{As population pressure keeps increasing, productive land in sub-Saharan
   Africa (SSA) is becoming increasingly scarce, while soil fertility
   research in SSA is shifting its focus away from production per se
   towards sustainable production. The vital role of spatial and temporal
   scales and their heterogeneity is highlighted in this paper. Spatial
   variation of soil nutrient stocks is shown for agro-ecological zones and
   soil classification units in East and West Africa, but also at the farm
   level and lower levels. Whereas researchers have traditionally focussed
   much on macrovariability, SSA farmers tend to cherish and maintain
   microvariability. Meanwhile, soil nutrient stocks are not static
   entities. On the contrary, studies in different parts of Africa, and at
   different spatial scales, show that they are being depleted at alarming
   rates as nutrients are annually taken away in crops or lost in
   processes, such as leaching and erosion which far exceed the nutrient
   inputs through fertilizers, deposition, and biological fixation. This
   shows how the absence of spatial and temporal variation in models based
   on soil fertility variables strongly diminishes their predictive value,
   and the role attributed to them in supporting land-use planning and farm
   household decision-making. An attempt should be made to quantify and
   monitor the different nutrient flows that play a role on farms and at
   higher levels of aggregation. It is argued that improved soil fertility
   can be achieved through integrated nutrient management (INM), as this
   scientific field is presently replacing traditional fertilizer research.
   Calculating and monitoring nutrient flows and quantifying the impact of
   INM systems on soil fertility, and hence on agricultural production and
   its sustainability, is a high priority issue. The shift of the research
   focus to INM systems implies a broader mandate and greater
   responsibility for soil and plant analytical laboratories in SSA.}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of a genetic map of the chicken enabled us to
   identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting susceptibility to
   Marek's disease (MD). The highly inbred Lines 6(3) (MD resistant) and
   7(2) (MD susceptible) were mated to create 300+ F-2 chickens. The F-2
   chickens were challenged with MD virus (MDV) at 1 week of age. The
   chickens were monitored far symptoms of MD susceptibility up to 10 weeks
   of age and all were necropsied to evaluate gross MD tumor and lesions;
   MDV viremia levels were determined 2 weeks post-challenge. Parametric
   and non-parametric ANOVA techniques were used in the QT. analysis. At
   the first stage of analysis, 65 DNA markers selected from the East
   Lansing genetic map were genotyped in 80 selected F-2 chickens, and 22
   markers residing near to potential QTLs affecting MD susceptibility were
   identified (P less than or equal to 0.2). At the second stage of
   analysis, significant markers at the first stage plus flanking markers
   (42 in total) were genotyped on the entire F-2 population. Eight QTLs (P
   less than or equal to 0.01), each affecting several components of MD
   susceptibility, were identified on seven linkage groups of the chicken.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is strong evidence that a few Neotropical migrant land
   birds have severely declining populations, we know of no evidence of
   general overall declines. One widely cited analysis of data from the
   Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), the only continental-scale monitoring
   program for land birds in the breeding season, indicates declining
   populations in eastern forests in the 1980s, but other analyses conclude
   that most species have had stable or increasing populations in the last
   25 ye These conflicting results call for a new perspective. Here, we
   propose two approaches to the analysis of BBS data that emphasize the
   detection of temporal and geographic variation in population trends. The
   first approach uses nonlinear regression to detect temporal changes in
   population trends, and permits the construction of graphs that compare
   nonlinear trends among regions. The second approach provides statistical
   tests of multispecies patterns of geographic variation in population
   trends.
   We report analyses of BBS data for 1966 to 1992 for the 26 species of
   wood warblers (Parulinae) for which the most data are available and the
   chance of obtaining reliable estimates is best. Using pooled data for
   all 26 species for eastern and central North America, nonlinear
   regression indicated declining populations in the Appalachian Mountains
   and the Eastern Foothills in the 1970s, and stability elsewhere. As
   examples of the use of this first approach in single-species analyses,
   we give maps, graphs, and statistical tests to illustrate variation in
   population trends by physiographic strata in the Blue-winged Warbler
   (Vermivora pinus) and the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus). As an example
   of the second approach, we applied a probit-normal model to a matrix of
   increases and decreases in the 26 species in 37 geographic strata. The
   analysis identified specific highland areas as having unusually high
   proportions of declining populations. These results suggest that
   correlates of elevation should be considered as factors possibly
   regulating populations of warblers and other land birds. Our perspective
   is that focus on studies of temporal and geographic variation in
   population trends of all birds, including Neotropical migrants, could
   help conservation biologists identify where species and groups of
   species are in the most trouble.}},

Title = {{Using landscape ecology to test hypotheses about large-scale abundance
   patterns in migratory birds}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that Neotropical migrant birds may be undergoing
   widespread declines due to land use activities on the breeding grounds
   has been examined primarily by synthesizing results from local studies.
   Growing concern for the cumulative influence of land use activities on
   ecological systems has heightened the need for large-scale studies to
   complement what has been observed at local scales. We investigated
   possible landscape effects on Neotropical migrant bird populations for
   the eastern United States by linking two large-scale inventories
   designed to monitor breeding-bird abundances and land use patterns. The
   null hypothesis of no relation between landscape structure and
   Neotropical migrant abundance was tested by correlating measures of
   landscape structure with bird abundance, while controlling for the
   geographic distance among samples.
   Neotropical migrants as a group were more `'sensitive'' to landscape
   structure than either temperate migrants or permanent residents.
   Neotropical migrants tended to be more abundant in landscapes with a
   greater proportion of forest and wetland habitats, fewer edge habitats,
   larger forest patches, and with forest habitats well dispersed
   throughout the scene. Permanent residents showed few correlations with
   landscape structure and temperate migrants were associated with habitat
   diversity and edge attributes rather than with the amount, size, and
   dispersion of forest habitats. The association between Neotropical
   migrant abundance and forest fragmentation differed among physiographic
   strata, suggesting that landscape context affects observed relations
   between bird abundance and landscape structure. Finally, associations
   between landscape structure and temporal trends in Neotropical migrant
   abundance were counter to those observed in space. Trends in Neotropical
   migrant abundance were negatively correlated with forest habitats. These
   results suggest that extrapolation of patterns observed in some
   landscapes is not likely to hold regionally, and that conservation
   policies must consider the variation in landscape structure associations
   observed among different types of bird species and in physiographic
   strata with varying land use histories.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring long-term population change is an integral part of effective
   conservation-oriented research and management, and is central to the
   current debate on the status of Neotropical migrant land birds. However,
   the analysis of count data such as the Breeding Bird Survey is
   complicated by the subjective nature of trend estimation, and by
   limitations inherent to extensive, volunteer-based surveys, such as
   measurement error and missing data. A number of analysis methods have
   been used that differ in their approach to dealing with these
   complications and produce different estimates of population change when
   applied to the same data. There is, however, no consensus as to which
   method is the most suitable. Many analytical issues remain unresolved,
   such as model of trend, observer effects, treatment of missing
   observations, distribution of counts, and data selection criteria. These
   issues make it difficult to evaluate the relative merits of the methods,
   although a number of new approaches (nonlinear regression, Poisson
   regression, estimating equations estimates) offer promising solutions to
   some problems. I suggest the use of Monte Carlo simulations to
   empirically test the performance of the methods under realistic,
   spatially explicit scenarios of population change, and provide an
   example of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{The selection and spread of insecticide resistance is an evolutionary
   phenomenon. Resistance becomes a problem for pest control when an allele
   conferring resistance increases in frequency within populations and then
   spreads more widely. Ecological genetics studies the interaction between
   population structure and the factors - mutation, selection, genetic
   drift and gene flow - that produce these changes. Traditionally,
   resistance studies identified only two phenotypes, susceptible or
   resistant, and made simplifying assumptions about the inheritance of
   resistance. Such an approach has impeded our ability to test alternative
   hypotheses about the evolution of resistance because the resistance
   phenotype can involve more than one major gene; the genetic basis of
   resistance can change over time; and the expression of resistance can
   vary throughout the life-cycle. More detailed evolutionary studies of
   resistance require suitable tools. Biochemical techniques, such as
   electrophoresis, antibody, protein and DNA-based technologies, provide
   the means to identify unambiguously gene products, or genes and their
   allelic variants. The techniques can address a wide range of issues such
   as: separation of sibling species, detection and monitoring of resistant
   individuals, and the distribution of resistance genes in populations.}},

Abstract = {{Pest-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) can be used to identify key
   predaceous biological control agents. A MAb library was used to (i)
   identify key indigenous predators of the sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia
   tabaci (Gennadius) and pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella
   (Saunders) and (ii) monitor the efficacy of an augmentative predator
   release targeted for these two pests.
   The gut contents of over 10000 individual predators indigenous to
   Arizona cotton fields were examined for the presence of whitefly and
   pink bollworm egg antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Five predator species with frequent positive assays for whitefly
   proteins were (\% positive): Collops vittatus (Say) (55\%), Geocoris
   spp. nymphs (39\%). Orius tristicolor (White) (38\%) and Hippodamia
   convergens Guerin-Meneville (33\%). The most frequent pink bollworm egg
   predator was Lygus hesperus Knight (adults 30\%, nymphs 20\%). L.
   hesperus was also the predator species with the highest percentage of
   individuals scoring positive for both pest egg antigens (12\%).
   In a separate experiment, we compared the efficacy of commercially
   reared Orius insidiosus (Say) against indigenous populations of O.
   tristicolor. The commercially reared predators were released into field
   cages, recaptured 36 hours later and examined by ELISA for the presence
   of whitefly and pink bollworm egg antigens. Some 4\% of the released O.
   insidiosus and 26\% of the indigenous O. tristicolor had whitefly egg
   antigen in their guts. Pink bollworm egg antigen was found in the guts
   of 8\% of the O. insidiosus and 5\% of the O. tristicolor.
   The immunologically based techniques described in this review can
   expedite the search for key indigenous predator species and also serve
   as a tool for monitoring the efficacy of augmentative biological control
   agents. The advantages and limitations of our techniques are discussed.}},

Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{502-511}},
Abstract = {{An explicitly spatial computer simulation model of local and regional
   population dynamics is used to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns
   of population decline for mobile animal species that exhibit varied
   degrees of habitat selection and for different landscapes comprised of
   two habitat types. The model included terms for local, within-habitat
   processes involving birth and death, and between-patch processes of
   immigration and emigration. Ten replicate simulations of 108 different
   factor-level combinations were used to examine relationships between
   increasing rates of mortality and local patterns of abundance. Results
   showed that a region wide decrease in survivorship increased the
   absolute and relative differences in species abundances among habitats
   and over landscapes. Declining populations were detected earlier in
   poorer than in better habitats, in landscapes with proportionately lower
   amounts of poorer habitats, and for species that actively select
   habitats than for those that did not. A better understanding of within-
   and between-habitat patterns of population decline may help decrease
   uncertainty in regional risk assessments and facilitate the further
   development of some species as indicators in large-scale environmental
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The lower part of the floodplain area of the Morava river at the
   Slovak-Austrian frontier was till 1990 closed for the public and from
   the ornithological viewpoint it is most valuable part of the 107.5 river
   km long Slovak reach of the river. This parr of the alluvium (from the 0
   km at the confluence of the Morava and the Danube up to the confluence
   of the Morava and Dyje) on the area of 9050.4 ha includes a complex of
   floodplain forests, dead arms, marshes, natural and semi-natural wet
   meadows being almost unknown in Slovakia. During our investigation in
   the lower part of the alluvium we found 201 bird species, i.e. 92.62 \%
   from the total amount of species found on the alluvium of the whole
   Slovak reach of the Morava river. 111 of them were nesting birds. Most
   species were found in floodplain forests (86) with the highest part of
   nesting birds (83.7 \%), less on meadows (84), and dead arms and marshes
   (82). A most conserved biotopes are on an interleveeal area (3527 ha).
   We can find here also a larger part (1672 ha) of the whole area (2329
   ha) of wet meadows. From the ornithological viewpoint this biotope is
   one of the most endangered ones in Slovakia. Except from suitable
   nesting conditions for rare nesting birds it offers rich supply of food
   for bird populations on the left-side (Slovak) and right-side (Austrian)
   areas of the alluvium. It is important mainly for birds of prey, white
   stork (Ciconia ciconia) and common heron (Ardea cinerea) nesting in
   colonies in the WWF reserve. A comparison of qualitative-quantitative
   representation of birds on the monitoring plots in the floodplain
   forests of the alluvium of the Morava, Danube and Little Danube reflects
   the difference in species composition of vegetation in floodplain
   forests. Since 1993 the whole alluvium of the Morava has been a selected
   Slovak area protected by the Ramsar Convention.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted in 1989 and 1990 to investigate the mechanism
   underlying patterns of invertebrate population recovery in winter wheat
   following treatment with the broad-spectrum insecticide dimethoate.
   Predation of Drosophila pupae and artificially induced aphid populations
   was monitored at different distances into plots treated with dimethoate.
   An initial drop in predation was recorded in all positions following
   treatment. Predation rate then showed a period of recovery, which
   progressed from the edge to the centre of the treated plots. This
   pattern of recovery corresponded to the numerical pattern of recovery of
   the predatory invertebrate groups; Carabidae, Staphylinidae and
   Linyphiidae. The results are discussed in terms of mechanisms to explain
   observed patterns of recovery of invertebrate `prey' groups such as
   aphids. It is concluded that the ranking of pesticides by their toxicity
   alone would fail to take into account ecological processes that
   determine the different patterns of population change following
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were done to determine the effect of 4 fruit ripeness levels on
   the abundance of Psyttalia fletcheri (Silvestri), a parasitoid of
   Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett). In addition, an improved trapping
   method was developed for monitoring mass-released adult parasitoids in
   the field. A total of 420,000 adult P. fletcheri were released over a
   period of 15 weeks, in a 0.16 ha experimental field plot containing
   cucumber, zucchini and tomato in Kauai, HI. We recovered significantly
   more P. fletcheri from rotting fruits of all fruit types than from
   immature, commercial grade or oversized fruits. In addition, there was a
   positive correlation between the number of P. fletcheri and B.
   cucurbitae recovered from rotting fruits. Average parasitism in rotting
   tomato, zucchini and cucumber was 5, 19 and 36\% respectively. Yellow
   pan traps were as effective as sticky sphere traps for monitoring P.
   fletcheri, indicating that parasitoids were foraging close to the ground
   where rotting fruits occurred. The pan traps were much easier to use,
   less expensive and required less set up time. Recovery of parasitoids
   from both fruit collections and pan traps indicated that P. fletcheri
   was least abundant in tomato. Both male and female parasitoids exhibited
   a weakly aggregated distribution in each crop. We discuss modified
   sampling and release methods for population estimation and augmentative
   release studies of P. fletcheri.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, rice farmers in Asia were thought to be unable to
   comprehend biological control because it was too esoteric. This
   perception was exacerbated by vested interest that prefers to maintain
   monopoly of information. Hence, between 1950 to 1990, the preferred
   method of extending technical information to farmers was to package them
   in `'simplistic'' messages. For example, prophylactic chemical control
   was a common approach of many extension systems in Asian economies
   during that period despite evidence from ecological studies to the
   contrary. In fact, the dogma that chemical control is equal to modern
   agriculture persists to this day in some countries. Such an approach
   often exaggerated yield loss figures to scare and justify use of
   chemical insecticides which eventually resulted in further yield losses.
   There has been increasing evidence that in tropical Asia, natural
   enemies are ubiquitous in rice fields and are responsible for keeping
   populations of rice herbivores in check. The rise of the brown
   planthopper as a serious pest was linked to regular use of insecticides.
   Outbreaks of this delphacid in tropical rice resulted from destruction
   of effective predators.
   With the help of biological control scientists, the FAO Intercountry
   Programme for Integrated Pest Control in South and Southeast Asia (ICP)
   presented evidence to the President of Indonesia in 1986 and secured a
   ban of 57 types of insecticides from rice fields. Promulgating
   legislative actions was a start and to sustain it an education programme
   to help farmers understand the importance of biological control was
   developed. This programme recognised that a traditional top-down process
   of instructing farmers would not help farmers and a non-formal education
   process of learning by experimenting and discovery was formulated. This
   approach emphasised the need for farmers to understand the rice
   ecosystem. Hence, rice fields became classrooms for farmers
   participating in the Farmer Field Schools. Farmers learned that not all
   arthropods in the field are pests and to their surprise, most of the
   arthropods are `'friendly'' insects. They discovered that these friendly
   insects eat herbivores. Using insecticide check and exclusion cage
   experiments, farmers learned of the adverse impact of insecticides and
   the impact of predators in keeping herbivore populations in check. The
   curriculum includes crop physiology, agronomy, health risks to
   insecticides and group dynamics. The principles of IPM emphasised in the
   Farmer Field Schools are: 1) Grow a healthy crop; 2) Visit fields
   regularly, preferably once a week to monitor field situation; 3)
   Understand and conserve natural enemies; 4) Farmers become experts in
   pest management. Adoption of this approach has led to a 60\% drop in use
   of insecticides resulting in 13\% increase in yield. Similar results
   were achieved in Vietnam and the Philippines. Facilitating farmers to
   understand biological control through field investigations is the key to
   successful implementation of Integrated Pest Management.}},

Abstract = {{Microclimatic conditions were monitored in cucumber grown under unheated
   plastichouses in three consecutive years, i.e. from 1990 to 1992 in
   Egypt. The relative humidity in the plastichouses constructed on either
   sandy br clay soil did not exceed 30\% during mid-day time, while the
   average temperature did not drop below 30 degrees C. Such conditions
   favoured population build up of the two spotted spider mite Tetranychus
   urticae Koch.
   In 1993 and 1994, three plastichouses planted to cucumber, cultivar Rawa
   or Hana were selected. Relative humidity in two of them was maintained
   over 50\% during the day using spraying nozzles, the third being kept as
   control. Mildew diseases induced by increased leaf wetness needed to be
   managed using fungicides. Phytoseiulus persimilis and P. longipes were
   released in the first two plastichouses, while acaricides were applied
   in the control. In early May T. urticae population increase on the
   growing top of cucumber plants required two acaricidal applications as
   predatory mites did not migrate to the apical leaves which were too warm
   and dry. More than 80\% of the maximum yield was obtained on average in
   plastichouses using increased relative humidity, but without any
   acaricidal applications.}},

Title = {{Application of an improved method for the analysis of pesticides and
   their metabolites in the urine of farmer applicators and their families}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{As the annual use of pesticides in the United States has escalated,
   public health agencies have become increasingly concerned about chronic
   pesticide exposure. However, without reliable, accurate analytical
   methods for biological monitoring, low-level chronic exposures are often
   difficult to assess. A method for measuring simultaneously the urinary
   residues of as many as 20 pesticides has been significantly improved.
   The method uses a sample preparation which includes enzyme digestion,
   extraction, and chemical derivatization of the analytes. The derivatized
   analytes are measured by using gas chromatography coupled with
   isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. The limits of detection of
   the modified method are in the high pg/L - low mu g/L range, and the
   average coefficient of variation (CV) of the method was below 20\% for
   most analytes, with approximately 100\% accuracy in quantification. This
   method was used to measure the internal doses of pesticides among
   selected farmer applicators and their families. Definite exposure and
   elimination patterns (i.e., an increase in urinary analyte levels
   following application and then a gradual decrease to background levels)
   were observed among the farmer applicators and many of the family
   members whose crops were treated with carbaryl, dicamba, and 2,4-D
   esters and amines. Although the spouses of farm workers sometimes
   exhibited the same elimination pattern, the levels of the targeted
   pesticides or metabolites found in their urine were not outside the
   ranges found in the general U.S. population (reference range). The
   farmer applicators who applied the pesticides and some of their children
   appeared to have higher pesticide or metabolite levels in their urine
   than those found in the general U.S. population, but their levels were
   generally comparable to or lower than reported levels in other
   occupationally exposed individuals. These results, however, were
   obtained from a nonrandom sampling of farm residents specifically
   targeted to particular exposures who may have altered their practices
   because they were being observed; therefore, further study is required
   to determine if these results are representative of pesticide levels
   among residents on all farms where these pesticides are applied using
   the same application techniques. Using this method to measure exposure
   in a small nonrandom farm population allowed differentiation between
   overt and background exposure. In addition, the important role of
   reference-range information in distinguishing between various levels of
   environmental exposure was reaffirmed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We have examined the effects of ionizing radiation on somatic mutations
   in vivo, using the hprt clonal assay. The study was performed on blood
   samples obtained from children exposed during a radiological accident
   that happened in 1987, in Goiania, Brazil. The group of children exposed
   to ionizing radiation includes six males and four females ranging in age
   from 6 to 14 years at the time of exposure. The radiation doses ranged
   from 15 to 70 cGy. A Brazilian control group, not exposed to ionizing
   radiation, was also analyzed under similar conditions. The mean hprt
   mutant frequency for the exposed group was 4.6 times higher than the
   control group, although the cloning efficiency from the exposed group
   was significantly reduced. Linear regression analysis of the mutant
   frequency and ionizing radiation dose did not show a significant
   relationship between these two parameters. However, a reliable inverse
   relationship was demonstrated when the regression analysis was performed
   with nonselective cloning efficiency and ionizing radiation dose. It was
   demonstrated that nonselective cloning efficiency diminishes as ionizing
   radiation dose increases. To correct mutant frequencies for clonal
   events, the clonal relationship between the hprt mutant clones was
   examined by T-cell receptor analysis. The majority of the mutants
   analyzed represented individual clones, thus validating the observed
   mutant frequencies. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Structural, and numeric chromosome aberrations (CA), sister-chromatid
   exchange (SCE), phytohemagglutinin stimulation (LI), proliferative rate
   index (PRI), and UV light-induced unscheduled DNA-synthesis (UDS) were
   investigated in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of 48 historical
   controls (''Controls''); of 14 hospital controls in Budapest, Hungary
   (''Budapest controls''); of 9 nurses occupationally exposed to low-dose
   ethylene-oxide (ETO) in Budapest (''Budapest exposed''); of 10 hospital
   controls in Eger, Hungary (''Eger controls''); and of 27 high dose
   ETC-exposed nurses in Eger (''Eger exposed''), where neoplasias, mainly
   breast cancers, were observed. ETO concentrations in the ambient air
   samples varied from 5 to 20 mg/m(3) in Budapest; and from 5 to 100
   mg/m(3) in Eger. Both LI and PRI were depressed in Budapest exposed,
   indicating ETO-induced cytotoxicity and, however, normal in Eger
   exposed. SCE was slightly elevated in Budapest exposed, but
   significantly increased in Eger exposed. The yields of cells with high
   frequency SCE (HFC) were only increased in Eger exposed. The expected
   low CA frequencies were found in Controls and in Budapest controls. ETO
   exposures significantly increased the CA frequencies in Budapest and
   Eger exposed. In Budopest exposed, as expected, we found deletions; in a
   lesser extent chromatid exchanges and dicentrics; but no rings were
   detected. These results are in a good accordance to the published data
   of other investigations carried out on ETC-exposed human populations.
   However, in Eger exposed, beside the increased yields of deletions, the
   frequencies of dicentrics and rings showed a significant excess compared
   to the reviewed data. An unexpected, significant increase of dicentric
   and ring frequencies was also detected among the hospital controls in
   Eger controls without known clastogenic exposure. The role of
   confounding factors (age, smoking and drinking habit, total leukocyte
   count and hematocrit) was investigated by an analysis of variance on CA
   and SCE frequencies in Controls and in Eger exposed. Leukocyte count and
   mean age showed only significant effects on CA in Eger exposed and on
   SCE in Controls, respectively. A possible active confounding factor
   could be the temporary natural radioactivity of the local tap water. UDS
   in Budapest exposed and in Eger control were significantly higher then
   in the Controls and in Budapest controls. In Eger exposed UDS was
   significantly decreased compared to the Budapest exposed and Eger
   control groups. The explanation of the present results is difficult on
   the basis of the reviewed data on ETC-induced CA frequencies in exposed
   human populations, and it raises an issue of an independent genotoxic
   effect in Eger, which is common both in Eger controls and in Eger
   exposed, such as natural radioactivity. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Modern technologies have provided the opportunity to monitor mutations
   in people in vivo. The subjects of this study were accidentally exposed
   to (137)Cesium in a radiological accident that occurred in September
   1987 in Goiania, Brazil, during which more than 150 people received
   doses greater than 0.1 Gy and as high as 7 Gy. The objective of this
   study was to determine how long the hprt mutant T-cells in the
   peripheral blood contribute to mutant frequency by examining the
   time-course of the T-lymphocyte response to ionizing radiation. This
   report describes the results obtained over a period of 2.3 to 4.5 years
   subsequent to the accident, from 11 subjects with doses ranging from 1
   to 7 Gy, and from nine control subjects selected from the same
   population. The mean ln MF (+/-SE) of the control group was 2.5 (+/-0.2)
   + ln 10(-6) The exposed group had a significantly increased mutant
   frequency; the mean In MF (+/-SE) were 3.3 (+/-0.3) + ln 10(-6), 2.8
   (+/-0.2) + ln 10(-6), and 2.3 (+/-0.2) + ln 10(-6), in the years
   1990-1992 respectively. Based on the decline of mutant frequency and
   using Buckton's models {[}Buckton et al. (1967): Nature 214:470-473], we
   demonstrated that mutant T-cells have a short-term memory with a
   half-life of 2.1 years. This relatively short half-life limits the
   effective use of the hprt assay as the method of choice to monitor past
   exposure. The data also demonstrate a positive correlation with age, and
   an inverse correlation with plating efficiency. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Accumulation of radionuclides was studied in molluscs from the
   territories polluted by the Chernobyl outburst. In addition to
   radiochemical evaluation of Sr-90, a simple method of beta-radiometry of
   shells was applied which allowed processing of extensive samples and
   mapping of contamination of large territories. the Dnieper drainage area
   and the Kiev administrative region. Pre-Hiroshima and pre-Chernobyl
   radioactivity was investigated in museum collections. Differences in
   Sr-90 accumulation in molluscs of different genera were demonstrated for
   freshwater and terrestrial snails, an especially, high accumulation
   factor was found in Helix. Indices of relative accumulation were
   calculated treating Lymnaea stagnalis as a standard. All the
   measurements were recalculated to this standard in order to provide
   comparisons between sampling sites disregarding collected species and to
   reduce variance before mapping. Based on shell beta-activity
   measurements, the average accumulation factor for Sr-90 in Lymnaea
   compared to its concentration in the river water was about 5000, its
   transfer factor compared to the soil contamination was about 0.1
   m(2)kg(-1), figures for Cs-137 were smaller by an order of magnitude.
   Inverse dependence between free calcium content in the environment and
   the transfer factor was demonstrated, as well as a difference in
   Sr-90/Cs-137 ratio in molluscs collected on different tracks of
   Chernobyl pollution. Monitoring the biologically accessible and
   biologically active fraction of Sr-90 contamination, the shell
   beta-activity above 15 kBq kg(-1) indicates a dangerous level of
   contamination for the human population. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Mandibular bone fluoride concentrations as well as frequency and
   intensity of fluoride-induced dental lesions were studied in four red
   deer populations from Czechia and Germany exposed to different levels of
   environmental fluoride. The degree of fluorosis in the permanent cheek
   teeth was recorded by a scoring system and the individual mandibles
   assigned to one of three categories (unfluorosed, slightly to moderately
   fluorosed, and markedly to severely fluorosed) on the basis of the tooth
   scores. An increase in the frequency and severity of dental fluorosis
   was positively associated with an increase in bone fluoride level, which
   itself was significantly different between the four samples. In all
   samples, the rate of bone fluoride accumulation was higher in younger
   than in older deer. The results of this study show that frequency and
   intensity of dental fluorosis can be used as valid indicators of
   increased fluoride exposure of deer populations, and thus as a quick,
   easy, economic and reliable means of monitoring fluoride pollution in
   areas inhabited by wild deer. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The survival of faecal and total coliform bacteria and Streptococcus
   faecalis (indicator bacteria) were monitored in experimental plots
   receiving various amounts of biological or dephosphatation municipal
   sewage sludge. Biological sludge was applied on coniferous and mixed
   regenerative forest soils. The results show that except for total
   coliforms, there was little significant treatment effect on the
   indicator bacteria numbers in all of the sires. In most cases, there was
   a significant time effect, indicating that bacterial populations vary
   over time, according to environmental factors such as temperature,
   moisture or nutrient level conditions. In total coliform bacteria,
   populations varied over time but also in function of treatment levels.
   The present study suggests that even if the standards of Quebec (Canada)
   for sludge application are respected, there may be some risk for
   bacterial contamination depending on the types of sewage sludge and
   forest habitat. Although there is only a short-term effect, high slopes
   can influence the movement of the indicator bacteria and may potentially
   cause some contamination problems.}},

Title = {{Ecological risk assessment of atrazine in North American surface waters}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{31-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The triazine herbicide atrazine
   (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-amino-s-triazine) is one of the most
   used pesticides in North America. Atrazine is principally used for
   control of certain annual broadleaf and grass weeds, primarily in corn
   but also in sorghum, sugarcane, and, to a lesser extent, other crops and
   landscaping. Atrazine is found in many surface and ground waters in
   North America, and aquatic ecological effects are a possible concern for
   the regulatory and regulated communities. To address these concerns an
   expert panel (the Panel) was convened to conduct a comprehensive aquatic
   ecological risk assessment. This assessment was based on several newly
   suggested procedures and included exposure and hazard subcomponents as
   well as the overall risk assessment. The Panel determined that use of
   probabilistic risk assessment techniques was appropriate. Here, the
   results of this assessment are presented as a case study for these
   techniques. The environmental exposure assessment concentrated on
   monitoring data from Midwestern watersheds, the area of greatest
   atrazine use in North America. This analysis revealed that atrazine
   concentrations rarely exceed 20 mu g/L in rivers and streams that were
   the main focus of the aquatic ecological risk assessment. Following
   storm runoff, biota in lower-order streams may be exposed to pulses of
   atrazine greater than 20 mu g/L, but these exposures are short-lived.
   The assessment also considered exposures in lakes and reservoirs. The
   principal data set was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, which
   monitored residues in 76 Midwestern reservoirs in 11 states in
   1992-1993. Residue concentrations in some reservoirs were similar to
   those in streams but persisted longer. Atrazine residues were widespread
   in reservoirs (92\% occurrence), and the 90th percentile of this
   exposure distribution for early June to July was about 5 mu g/L.
   Mathematical simulation models of chemical fate were used to generalize
   the exposure analysis to other sites and to assess the potential effects
   of reduction in the application rates. Models were evaluated, modified,
   and calibrated against available monitoring data to validate that these
   models could predict atrazine runoff. PRZM-2 overpredicted atrazine
   concentrations by about an order of magnitude, whereas GLEAMS
   underpredicted by a factor of 2 to 5. Thus, exposure models were not
   used to extrapolate to other regions of atrazine use in this assessment.
   The effects assessment considered both freshwater and saltwater toxicity
   test results. Phytoplankton were the most sensitive organisms, followed,
   in decreasing order of sensitivity, by macrophytes, benthic
   invertebrates, zooplankton, and fish. Atrazine inhibits
   photophosphorylation but typically does not result in lethality or
   permanent cell damage in the short term. This characteristic of atrazine
   required a different model than typically used for understanding the
   potential impact in aquatic systems, where lethality or nonreversible
   effects are usually assumed. In addition, recovery of phytoplankton from
   exposure to 5 to 20 mu g/L atrazine was demonstrated. In some mesocosm
   field experiments, phytoplankton and macrophytes were reduced after
   atrazine exposures greater than 20 mu g/L. However, populations were
   quickly reestablished, even while atrazine residues persisted in the
   water.
   Effects in field studies were judged to be ecologically important only
   at exposures of 50 mu g/L or greater. Mesocosm experiments did not
   reveal disruption of either ecosystem structure or function at atrazine
   concentrations typically encountered in the environment (generally 5 mu
   g/L or less).
   Based on an integration of laboratory bioassay data, field effects
   studies, and environmental monitoring data from watersheds in high-use
   areas in the Midwestern United States, the Panel concluded that atrazine
   does not pose a significant risk to the aquatic environment. Although
   some inhibitory effects on algae, phytoplankton, or macrophyte
   production may occur in small streams vulnerable to agricultural runoff,
   these effects are likely to be transient, and quick recovery of the
   ecological system is expected. A subset of surface waters, principally
   small reservoirs in areas with intensive use of atrazine, may be at
   greater risk of exposure to atrazine. Therefore, it is recommended that
   site-specific risk assessments be conducted at these sites to assess
   possible ecological effects in the context of the uses to which these
   ecosystems are put and the effectiveness and cost-benefit aspect of any
   risk mitigation measures that may be applied.}},

Abstract = {{A number of chemical pollutants have physiological effects mimicking
   those of estrogen. These xenobiotic estrogens pose an insidious risk to
   wildlife and humans by disrupting reproductive and developmental
   processes, thereby impairing both the exposed individuals and their
   offspring. Xenobiotic estrogens are impacting both wildlife and human
   health, thus it is important to screen chemicals for estrogenic
   potential, and to monitor environmental levels of estrogenic pollutants.
   Although most known xenobiotic estrogens show little structural
   similarity, they do produce predictable physiological responses. This
   allows the use of functional estrogenicity assays employing specific
   biomarkers of estrogen action, such as vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is an
   egg-yolk precursor protein produced by the liver in response to
   estrogens and estrogen agonists. Vitellogenin is normally found only in
   the serum of adult female oviparous vertebrates, but it can be induced
   in males and immature females by estrogen. Vitellogenin induction
   bioassays can be used to screen chemicals for estrogenic and
   antiestrogenic activity, to test water for the presence of xenobiotic
   estrogens, and to screen wildlife populations for exposure to
   environmental estrogens.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that most chemical carcinogens act by binding to
   cellular genetic material and causing somatic mutations. Chemical
   modification of DNA (e.g., the formation of DNA adducts) is the first in
   a series of stages that lead to mutation, cell transformation, and tumor
   development.
   Sensitive methods for detection of DNA adducts are essential for
   mechanistic studies of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and for
   biomonitoring of populations at risk for environmentally caused cancer.
   DNA adducts may be detected with such methods as P-32-postlabeling,
   immunoassays, HPLC with fluorescence detection, and gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry, with varying degrees of sensitivity
   and structural specificity. Alkylation at the N-7 position of guanine is
   a preferential site of attack for most alkylating agents, but may be of
   little biological consequence, while adduct formation at the O-6
   position of guanine (less common) is most highly correlated with
   carcinogenesis.
   We have examined the suitability of western mosquitofish (Gambusia
   affinis) as a native sentinel species for monitoring environmental
   exposures to mutagens and carcinogens. Mosquitofish are a native species
   to the U.S. and are also widely distributed in warm waters throughout
   the world. These fish are ideal for monitoring local exposures because
   they are non-migratory and are found in a wide variety of habitats. In
   the laboratory, they are easily cultured using techniques developed for
   other small fish species and appear resistant to infectious diseases.
   Thus, methods may be directly assessed under controlled conditions
   before being applied to field situations.
   In these studies, mosquitofish were exposed to a model alkylating agent,
   methylazoxymethanol acetate, at 10 ppm in the ambient water for 2 h.
   Fish were then transferred to clean water and held for up to 72 h.
   Livers were excised, pooled for 5 fish, and DNA was extracted and
   prepared for analysis. Liver DNA extracts were assessed for levels of
   N-7 and O-6-methylguanine by isotope dilution GC/mass spectrometry,
   using deuterated analogs of methylguanine adducts as standards.
   Detection limits for the assay were approximately 1.6 femtamoles of
   adduct per mg DNA (about 1 adduct per 2 million bases). Approximately
   55-185 pg (330-1100 femtomoles) O-6-methylguanine per mg DNA were
   measured in exposed fish in the first 72 h after exposure. These lesions
   were correlated with a 33\% liver tumor incidence after 25 weeks in
   parallel experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty Finnish isolates of Rhynchosporium secalis (Oud.) J.J. Davis, the
   causal agent of scald, were taken from infected barley (Hordeum vulgare
   L.) plants and inoculated on to seedlings of a differential series of
   barley containing a range of major genes for resistance to the fungus,
   as well as on to six Nordic B-row spring barleys and three winter ryes
   (Secale cereale L.). These fungal isolates derived from four sites and
   three host varieties. Disease development was monitored on two leaves of
   seedlings in the greenhouse employing a standard scale, and on adult
   plants in the field by assessing the diseased area on the three
   uppermost leaves. A comparison was also made between the pathogenicity
   and virulence of ten Finnish and ten Canadian R. secalis isolates. The
   Finnish isolates varied in virulence, but with the exception of Algerian
   (CI 1179) seedlings and adult La Mesita (CI 7565) all seedlings and
   adult plants of the entire differential series were resistant to all
   isolates. Canadian isolates were, on average, less virulent than Finnish
   isolates. All the Nordic checks were susceptible to all Finnish and
   seven Canadian isolates, but differences in the degree of susceptibility
   were evident. Isolates of R. secalis from barley were non-pathogenic on
   rye, isolates from Elymus repens L. were non-pathogenic on barley and
   rye, and isolates from rye were only pathogenic on rye. Finnish R.
   secalis isolates contain no redundant pathogenic diversity. The
   differential series represents a useful, but as yet untapped, source of
   resistance to R. secalis for Finnish barley breeders.}},

Abstract = {{In a vineyard having three varieties of grape (Merlot, Trebbiano and
   Garganega) differently colonized by two phytoseiid species, Typhlodromus
   pyri Scheuten and Amblyseius andersoni (Chant), the dynamics of mite
   populations were monitored over 5 years (1989-1993) in order to study
   their colonization, interspecific competition and the control of spider
   mites, i.e. Panonychus ulmi (Koch). These aspects were also investigated
   by releasing T. pyri, A. andersoni and Amblyseius aberrans (Oudemans) on
   some of the above varieties. Tn most of the experimental years
   (1989-1992), selective pesticides were used in order to allow a
   successful release of phytoseiids, in particular A. aberrans. The use of
   non-selective insecticides was re-established during 1993 in order to
   test its effect on the new mite communities originating from 1989
   onwards. In the first years of the experiments an apparent relationship
   between grape variety and phytoseiid species was observed: in the
   control plots, A. andersoni occurred on Merlot where T. pyri was rare,
   while the latter species was largely dominant over A. andersoni on
   Trebbiano and Garganega. Panonychus ulmi populations reached moderate
   levels only on Merlot and in the first part of experiments. The
   variety-phytoseiid species relationship was temporary as, at the end of
   experiments, T. pyri was completely dominant on all varieties. This new
   situation started when prey occurrence and interspecific competition
   decreased in importance. The moderate success of the T. pyri release on
   Merlot contrasts with the results of previous experiments. Two factors
   could be involved in this phenomenon: low interspecific competition by
   phytoseiids and predation by macropredators. Amblyseius aberrans was
   able to displace A. andersoni and T. pyri on grape varieties where the
   two species were more abundant and reached higher population densities
   on varieties with pubescent leaf undersurfaces. In the first
   experimental year, spider mite densities were reduced more effectively
   in A. aberrans release plots than in the control or in T. pyri release
   plots. One year later, P. ulmi reached lower levels in the release
   treatments than in the control. Typhlodromus pyri and A. aberrans
   persisted in conditions of prey scarcity. The high competitivity of A.
   aberrans over the remaining two phytoseiid species constitutes a major
   factor in selecting predatory species for inoculative releases in
   vineyards.}},

Abstract = {{Much debate in ecology has focused on the roles of density-independent
   factors (e.g. temperature) and density-dependent factors (e.g.
   resources) in regulating populations of animals, particularly
   ectotherms. I incorporate parameters expressed as general functions of
   temperature into a simple mechanistic model of resource-limited
   population growth. This model predicts that increased temperature should
   lead to greater density-dependent per capita mortality rates and lower
   equilibrium densities. I tested these predictions in a Field experiment
   by monitoring mortality in grasshopper (Orthoptera: Acrididae)
   populations stocked at different densities in replicate cages and
   subjected to one of three different thermal treatments (shaded, control,
   or greenhouse). With increased temperature, per capita mortality rates
   were significantly higher and grasshopper densities at the end of the
   experiment were significantly lower. Increased temperature was
   associated with increased density-dependent mortality but not
   density-independent mortality. These results support the predictions of
   the model. In addition, strong interactions between temperature and
   resources may make species' populations more sensitive to thermal
   environmental change than would be expected from species' thermal
   tolerances.}},

Abstract = {{Recent analyses of aphid population dynamics have used yearly totals of
   the suction trap catches of aphids, but it is questionable whether such
   analyses reveal anything more than that aerial numbers are regulated in
   some way. The numbers of the host specific Turkey-oak aphid, Myzocallis
   boerneri, on two Quercus cerris trees have been monitored weekly for 18
   years. This census data was analysed to determine the nature of the
   density dependence and the time scale over which it operated. In
   addition, an individual based simulation model was developed for the
   aphid and used to identify possible mechanisms of regulation. The
   partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots of seasonally adjusted
   data revealed that aphid abundance is regulated by First-order density
   dependent processes acting over a time frame of a month or less. A
   correlation matrix also confirmed that the spring and autumn increases
   and the numbers overwintering are predictable, but not the extent of the
   summer decline. The model was used to predict seasonal population
   trends. The output very closely matched the empirical data, suggesting
   that the regulatory process is intraspecific competition for resources,
   causing an immediate size related reduction in recruitment and increase
   in the tendency to migrate. The correlation matrix indicated a negative
   correlation between the numbers in July and those next spring. The
   negative correlation between the numbers of First generation in spring
   and the last generation in autumn, observed in other tree-dwelling
   aphids, is weak or not present in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The competitiveness (C) of released, mass-reared Australian sheep
   blowfly, Lucilia cuprina has been shown to vary as their frequency in
   the mating population changes with C declining as the frequency of
   released males increases. While the mole L. cuprina studied carried a
   Y-autosome translocation, reanalysis of published data on genetic
   control programs suggest that this effect may be exhibited by other mass
   reared insects, and is not restricted to this particular Lucilia strain.
   Simple stochastic models are employed to determine the consequences of
   this phenomenon to the efficacy of the sterile insect release method
   (SIRM). When C is frequency dependent, the overall cost of SIRM programs
   to eradicate target populations is increased as 1) ii is necessary to
   release for a longer period, and 2) additional sterile males are
   required. This effect is especially evident when large numbers of
   sterile insects are released, causing high released: wild ratios, which
   is commonly the approach employed. However, by monitoring the wild
   population throughout the course of the release program and adjusting
   release numbers accordingly, acceptable competitiveness levels may be
   maintained. The financial benefits of such a strategy depend on the
   relative cost of rearing and releasing flies, but considerable savings
   can be expected for typical SIRM programs.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{We studied the interactions between two entomopathogenic nematode
   species each with a different foraging behavior in the presence of two
   hosts at different soil depths. One week after nematode inoculation,
   hosts were added to the soil and additional hosts added at 30-day
   intervals. The densities of infective juveniles of the two nematode
   species were monitored over 90 to 180-day periods in soil samples or
   directly in the experimental containers using wax moth larvae as baits.
   Host placement in the soil strongly influenced the outcome of the
   competition between the sit-and-wait forager (ambusher) Steinernema
   carpocapsae and active forager (cruiser) S. glaseri. When hosts were
   introduced at 2 and 10 cm depths, few S. carpocapsae were recovered at
   60 days and onwards after the first hosts had been introduced. S.
   glaseri, on the other hand, was not adversely affected by the presence
   of S. carpocapsae. When hosts were introduced at 0 and 10 cm depths, S.
   carpocapsae persisted in the presence of S. glaseri at significantly
   lower numbers than when it was alone, whereas S. glaseri was not
   significantly affected by the presence of S. carpocapsae. Numbers of
   recovered S. glaseri however, tended to decrease after 30-60 days, even
   in the absence of its competitor. We postulate that this decrease was
   because of its high susceptibility to intraspecific competition. In the
   combination of S. carpocapsae and the active forager Heterorhabditis
   bacteriophora, S. carpocapsae dominated the system during the first 90
   days, and H. bacteriophora dominated during the last 60 days. In the
   laboratory, an ambusher and a cruiser entomopathogenic nematode species
   can coexist. In the field, many other factors will influence the
   population dynamics, and the higher diversity should promote the
   coexistence of entomopathogenic nematode species with different foraging
   behavior.}},

Title = {{An endemic condition of biochemical hypoglycemia among male volunteers}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{323-333}},
Abstract = {{Biochemical hypoglycemia has attracted attention because it triggers
   accidents through errors in judgment by impairing cognitive function.
   Its prevalence and associated risk factors have remained unexplored in
   the area of occupational health. The present study was designed to
   investigate its epidemiological aspects in male volunteers. The study
   population of 76 malt! volunteers, 63 of whom were firefighters and 13
   had other jobs, filled out questionnaires by interview covering 37
   factors concerning age, physical parameters, past and current health
   problems, habits !smoking, drinking, and exercise), food preferences and
   life style. The participants were asked to measure their blood glucose
   levels 9 times over a representative workday and holiday and record any
   symptoms of hypoglycemia at the time of measurement. The body fat ratio
   of each participant was measured by the bioelectrical impedance analysis
   method. 22.4\% of the participants (17/76) experienced biochemical
   hypoglycemia (less than 60 mg/dl) at the time of blood glucose
   monitoring. Those who experienced biochemical hypoglycemia had
   significantly lower peak, average and nadir blood glucose levels (p <
   0.05; 115.1 +/- 18.7 mg/dl, 82.2 +/- 7.0 mg/dl, 52.2 +/- 5.6 mg/dl,
   respectively) than those who did not (129.9 +/- 26.7 mg/dl, 97.0 +/- 9.9
   mg/dl, 75.9 +/- 9.7 mg/dl, respectively). No symptom other than sudden
   hunger (p < 0.05) was correlated with biochemical hypoglycemia. Lower
   lean body mass index (lean body mass/height(2)) was the only
   statistically significant contributory risk factor (P < 0.05, Odds
   ratio: 2.91, 95\% confidence interval 1.29-6.65) by multiple logistic
   analysis. Mean blood glucose levels had a positive correlation with lean
   body mass index (P < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.372). The present results suggest
   that biochemical hypoglycemia is a potential risk problem in
   occupational settings. Low L.B.M.I. males should be educated about the
   possibility of biochemical hypoglycemia whoever have experienced a
   feeling of sadden hunger, Such precautions should he highly recommended
   to workers under dangerous and/or tense conditions in order to prevent
   error accidents in occupational settings.}},

   Various chemical and physical parameters were monitored at the same time
   as Microcystis sampling, however, there was no correlation between these
   parameters and microcystin dynamics. The spatial distribution of
   microcystin in the Microcystis population was investigated once and
   showed no difference between samples taken at five stations. The
   microcystin concentration in the cell free water from the reservoir was
   below the detection threshold (<1 mu g L(-1)). Size dependent fractions
   of the Microcystis population analyzed for microcystin concentration
   correlated with colony size. In the small fraction (>30 <66 mu m)

Abstract = {{In Hungary eight years, experiences are available in implementing IPM.
   In order to make logical decisions about the necessity of treatments and
   to choose the most suitable selective preparations - taking into
   consideration also the interest of parasitoids and predators - the most
   important investigation or monitoring methods used are: systematic plant
   surveying, monitoring the population dynamics of the main pests,
   operating pheromone traps in order to observe important lepidopteran
   spp., monitoring the occurence of predators and parasitoids, registering
   the occurence of secondary pests.
   In the recommendation of the program, the insecticides Pirimor
   (pirimicarb), Dimilin 25 WP (diflubenzuron), Insegar (fenoxycarb), Match
   (lufenuron), Dipel (Bt), Zolone (phosalone), Neviken
   (sulphur+vaselinoil) were applied. As acaricides Mitac (amitraz) and
   Torque 55 (fenbutin oxide) were used. Only those fungicides were
   applied, which did not endanger predatory mites.
   Using IPM technology, we succeed in: keeping the density of leaf miners
   below the level of economic loss; retarding the build-up of populations
   of leaf rollers, mainly of Adoxophyes orana by using two treatments per
   year. The population density of Zetzellia mall and Phytoseiidae species
   increase and they are able to regulate the population dynamics of
   tetranychid mites. The parasitoids the leaf rollers and leaf miners can
   immigrate in the IPM plot, and in the orchard their population density
   Increase.
   The population density of aphids (Dysaphis devecta, D. plantaginea,
   Aphis pomi) is regularly high in the IPM orchards, therefore we have to
   use every year pirimicarb against them. From the secondary pests
   Anthonomus pomorum and Stephanitis pyri multiplied in the orchard.}},

   assessment for the apple sawfly Hoplocampa testudinea within the scope
   of IFP in Switzerland. A soil temperature driven phenology model proved
   to be a useful tool to determine the optimal time for the installation
   of white sticky traps. Based on mark-release-recapture experiments the
   optimal number of traps for a reliable population monitoring was found
   to be three per variety. Due to the limited range of action of the traps
   and the low mobility and heterogeneous distribution of the sawflies a
   maximum distance of 50m between traps is suggested. The relationship
   between trap catches and infestation level varies between the different
   cultivars. and hence specific economic injury levels have to be
   established.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1990 we have been monitoring the populations of pear pests and
   beneficials in a commercial orchard free from pesticides.
   The Heteroptera, Anthocoridae and Miridae, were the predators whose
   populations were more related to the dynamics of Cacopsylla pyri
   populations.
   Within the Anthocoridae, Anthocoris nemoralis was able to respond to
   psylla outbreaks, with a stronger response when the outbreak was in
   summer than when it: was in autumn. The group of Ol-ius species was more
   constant in numbers and as abundant as A. nemoralis the years without
   psylla outbreaks.
   The Miridae appeared every year earlier than the Anthocoridae and in
   numbers related to the psylla population from the previous year. The
   years with the higher initial numbers of Miridae showed the lower peaks
   of psylla. Although these predators are polyphagous, as are the Orius
   species, their populations were more related to the psylla fluctuations.
   These relationship can clearly be seen in Pilophorus perplexus, the
   species that could be identified every year in all its stages.}},

Abstract = {{1. Data from Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (EMS) transect counts were used
   to investigate the decline in synchrony of population fluctuations with
   increasing distance between sample units, and to evaluate the relative
   effects of local and regional scale processes on population
   fluctuations.
   2. Each BMS transect is divided into sections and numbers (densities) of
   butterflies are recorded separately in each section. Local scale
   analyses examined population fluctuations on different sections within a
   single transect. Regional scale analyses examined fluctuations on
   different transects.
   3. At the local scale population dynamics were found to be more closely
   synchronized between very close population units (sections) than more
   distant ones. There was considerable variation between data sets but on
   average this correlation declined relatively quickly over 1-2 km.
   4. At the regional scale, where local environmental heterogeneity was
   averaged out (sections were lumped together within transect sites), the
   decline in synchrony with increasing distance (up to 200 km) was very
   small compared with local scale decrease, and populations remain
   partially synchronized throughout the range studied due to regionally
   correlated weather patterns.
   5. Butterfly dispersal had a significant effect on synchrony at a local
   scale (several km): the dynamics of populations of relatively mobile
   species remained correlated over relatively long distances. At the
   regional level, however, mobility was not a significant factor, implying
   that widespread environmental stochasticity is of over-riding importance
   at this scale.
   6. Although mobility and distance are significant factors in determining
   population synchrony/asynchrony, the low r(2) values attributable to
   them indicate that these factors are actually contributing relatively
   little to the overall dynamics. Butterfly species show local variation
   in population dynamics, nested within broad scale synchrony which is
   presumably generated by the climate. Heterogeneity in population
   dynamics, in local environments, potentially aids metapopulation
   persistence by buffering the effects of high levels of temporal
   environmental stochasticity.}},

Abstract = {{The general reproductive pattern in spiders is to produce large clutches
   with small eggs although some species produce a few, large eggs. The
   spider Stegodyphus lineatus (Eresidae) is unusual in that it lays a
   single extremely small clutch and has small eggs. The female feeds the
   young after hatching and eventually the young completely consume her.
   Differential mortality risks in different life stages may provide an
   explanation of relative maternal investment in eggs versus hatchlings.
   By monitoring natural populations of S. lineatus, sources and rates of
   mortality were assessed during the reproductive period. Complete failure
   of reproduction was more likely during egg development than after the
   spiderlings had hatched. This was partially explained by the presence of
   a parasitoid wasp that only attacked females before the young had
   hatched. Overall attack rates were similiar in the egg stage and in the
   hatchling stage; however, the spiderlings suffered less mortality
   because they were mobile.
   By allocating the major reproductive effort to hatchlings rather than
   eggs, these spiders may pass through the risky egg stage relatively
   fast; and overall development and growth can be maximized. Small egg
   size might be an adaptation to high predation pressure during the
   reproductive period. Small clutch size can be explained by the
   importance of early growth for offspring fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Exposures to acid aerosols have been associated with acute and chronic
   health effects. Beginning in 1988, extensive monitoring of acid aerosols
   (H+), sulfates SO42-), and ammonia (NH3) was conducted in 24 communities
   in the United States and Canada in order to characterize the seasonal
   and daily variations of these pollutants. More recently, in 1992 and
   1993, summer monitoring of the same pollutants was conducted by Harvard
   researchers at multiple locations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to
   examine the factors causing spatial variation in the acidity levels in
   the greater metropolitan Philadelphia area. Earlier, a similar study
   also was conducted by Harvard in a more rural community, State College,
   Ohio, providing data on acidity, sulfate, and ammonia levels. In
   addition to these studies, New York University researchers have gathered
   substantial data on aerosol acidity, sulfates, and NH3 levels from sites
   in the New York City metropolitan region, Albany, Buffalo, and the
   Toronto metropolitan region between 1988 and 1992. This paper examines
   the relationships among H+, SO42-, ozone, and population density using
   summer measurements from sites in 24 cities across the United States and
   Canada, as well as Philadelphia, State College, the New York City
   region, Buffalo, and Albany. While past studies have consistently shown
   that H+ and SO42- are 4 correlated over time at sites in eastern North
   America, the results of our analysis show that spatial variations in the
   ratios of mean acid-to-sulfate levels also can be predicted
   satisfactorily with the use of either a linear or a quadratic model,
   once variations in population density are addressed (R(2) = 0.6). These
   models may be useful in retrospective epidemiological investigations of
   acid aerosol exposures and health effects, using widely available
   sulfate measurements and data on local population size.}},

Abstract = {{The PTEAM Study was the first large-scale probability-based study of
   personal exposure to particles. Sponsored by the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) and the Air Resources Board of California, it
   was carried out by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and the Harvard
   University School of Public Health (HSPH). HSPH designed and constructed
   a 4-lpm, battery-operated personal monitor for inhalable particles
   (PM(10)) that could be wont comfortably for up to 14 hours by persons
   from 10 to 70 years old. The monitor was worn for two consecutive
   12-hour periods (day and night) during the fall of 1990 by 178
   participants representing 139,000 nonsmoking residents of Riverside,
   California. Nearly identical monitors were employed to collect
   concurrent indoor and outdoor samples. The monitors were equipped with a
   different sampling nozzle to collect fine particles (PM(2.5)).
   Population-weighted daytime personal PM(10) exposures averaged 150 +/- 9
   (SE) mu g/m(3), compared to concurrent indoor and outdoor concentrations
   of 95 +/- 6 mu g/m(3). This suggested the existence of excess mass near
   the person, a `'personal cloud'' that appeared related to personal
   activities. Fourteen of 15 prevalent elements also were elevated in the
   personal samples. The two major indoor sources of indoor particles were
   smoking and cooking; even in these homes, however, more than half of the
   indoor particles came from outdoors, and a substantial portion of the
   indoor particles were of undetermined indoor origin.
   Outdoor concentrations near the homes were well correlated with outdoor
   concentrations at the central site, supporting the idea of using the
   central site as an indicator of ambient concentrations over a wider
   area. Indoor concentrations were only weakly correlated with outdoor
   concentrations, however, and personal exposures were even more poorly
   correlated with outdoor concentrations. Elemental profiles were obtained
   for environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (major contributions from
   potassium and chlorine) and cooking emissions (aluminum, iron, calcium,
   and chlorine). These profiles can be used in future source apportionment
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of colonization and subsequent population density increases of
   Dreissena have been monitored annually at a sire in eastern Lake Erie
   near the Niagara River. Striking changes in environmental conditions
   coincided with build-up of the Dreissena population from 1989 to 1992. A
   peak mean population density of 320,000 individuals/m(2) was observed in
   July 1991. Changes in conditions between 1988 and 1992 were
   characterized by: a progressive shift in sediment particle size
   distribution from fine sand of a mean particle size of 125-200 mu m to
   silt-sized particles of a mean particle size of 4-7 mu m; increased
   sediment concentrations of total organic carbon, polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH) and some metals; secchi disc transparency increases
   from less than 4 m to over 6 m, chlorophyll a concentration decreases
   from over 3 mu g/L to less than 1 mu g/L and; decreases in numbers of
   native bivalves and polychaetes while gammarid amphipods and tubificid
   worms remained abundant. Data suggest that the large Dreissena
   population has altered depositional patterns of sediment in this area of
   eastern Lake Erie.}},

Abstract = {{Megachile inermis Provancher and M. relativa Cresson populations were
   monitored in wooden `'trap-nests'' in Upper Michigan between 1985 and
   1992. Completed nests were routinely replaced with empty tunnels so that
   nest sites were less likely to be limiting than in natural populations.
   M. inermis, the larger species, nested in tunnels 11 mm in diameter
   whereas M. relativa nested in tunnels 5.5 and 6.0 mm in diameter.
   Numbers of M. inermis nests generally increased each year, except when
   floral resources were low in drought years and at one dry site. Nest
   numbers of the small species were more consistent over sites and years,
   but never reached the extremes of M. inermis nests. M. relativa nest
   structure was more variable than that of M. inermis nests in number of
   cells per nest and amount of empty space in the nest. The small species
   was more likely than the large species to make nests with few cells, to
   abandon nests before they were complete, or to have them usurped by
   other trap-nesting bees and wasps. This suggests that even when nest
   sites are abundant, the small species may be limited more by
   inter-specific competition for nest tunnels than the large species,
   while the large species may be limited more by pollen resources than the
   small species.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{18-28}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We tested 1 index of density (a kilometric index: number of sightings
   per km of transect) and 2 estimators of population number
   (Petersen-Lincoln, strip transect), all based on direct observation
   data, against actual animal number in an enclosed population of fallow
   deer (Danza dama) of known size. The study included phases of population
   increase, stability and decrease, and took place in woodland habitat
   typical of that inhabited by wild temperate ungulates. All 3 estimators
   were good reflectors of population trend, explaining 75-96\% of the
   variation in actual population number during the e-year study. Using the
   Petersen-Lincoln method and the strip transect method, reasonably
   unbiased estimates of absolute population size were obtained (percent
   relative bias: between -8.1 and 8.2\%, and -19.5 and -3.4\%,
   respectively), however, some bias was detected in each measure. Little
   difference in observability among sex-age classes or among marked
   individuals was found, suggesting such data may be used to determine
   population structure. For management purposes, a kilometric index based
   on highly standardized methods may provide a powerful, cost-effective
   tool to monitor population trend. Where an estimate of absolute animal
   number is required and habitat structure is sufficiently homogeneous to
   aid measurement of the width of the observation band, these same data
   may be used in a strip transect approach, extrapolating to an estimate
   of population size. Whatever the method employed, use of data from
   summer and autumn periods should be avoided because of problems of
   differential visibility during the growing season and altered behavior
   patterns during the autumn rut.}},

Abstract = {{Because immunocontraception may have management application for
   white-tailed deer populations in parks and preserves where hunting is
   illegal or impractical, we examined physiological aspects of
   immunocontraception with porcine zonae pellucidae (PZP) in fertile
   white-tailed does (Odocoileus virginianus). In 4 experiments, we
   examined the effectiveness of 3- and 2-PZP injections for controlling
   fertility of does, as well as 2 protocols using 1 injection. We used
   sample sizes of 5, 8, 6, and 7 does for PZP treatment and 8, 6, 6, and 7
   does for controls in the experiments. We administered a single PZP
   booster inoculation after 1 year to all does used in the 3-injection
   experiment. Each 1-injection vaccination consisted of 1 dose of PZP as
   in other protocols plus a second controlled-release dose of PZP
   delivered via an osmotic minipump implant or injected biodegradable
   polymer microspheres. We monitored fawn production for 1-3 years in all
   does and measured serum anti-PZP antibody titers at various times post
   treatment in 15 randomly selected PZP-treated does and in 2 control
   does. Except for 2 of 7 does given 1 injection containing microspheres,
   none of the PZP-treated does in any experiment produced fawns the first
   year after treatment. In 49 possible breeding periods among control does
   (placebo = 8, untreated = 41) the pooled incidence of fawn production
   was 93.8\%. Fawn production among 8 monitored does (2- and 3-injection
   protocols) was 75\% 2 years after treatment was discontinued,
   demonstrating reversibility of treatment. Serum anti-PZP antibody titers
   (17 does tested) were present only after PZP treatment, and highest
   titers occurred in does given 2 or 3 separate PZP injections. Regardless
   of protocol, PZP-treated does with >50\% of maximal antibody titers at
   the onset of a breeding season did not produce fawns, whereas does with
   <33\% of maximal titers produced fawns. In 82\% of 2- and 3-injection
   does and in 50\% of 1-injection does the antibody titers remained >50\%
   of maximal after 32-40 weeks. Our data demonstrate in white-tailed does
   that PZP vaccination: (1) can produce contraception for at least 1
   breeding season, (2) yields greater efficacy with multiple injections
   than with 1 injection, (3) is reversible within 2 years in 75\% of does,
   (4) is associated with elevated anti-PZP antibody titers, and (5) can
   produce a sustained antibody response through at least 1 breeding
   season. The titer data suggest that PZP vaccine in white-tailed deer
   behaves in a manner physiologically similar to PZP vaccine effects
   reported in several other species. The fawn count data indicate that PZP
   vaccine has potential management application for white-tailed deer.}},

Abstract = {{We collected 48 blood and 61 feather samples from nestling bald eagles
   (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at 42 nests and adult feather samples from 20
   nests in north and central Florida during 1991-93. We obtained 32 liver,
   10 feather, and 5 blood samples from 33 eagle carcasses recovered in
   Florida during 1987-93. For nestlings, mercury concentrations in blood
   (GM = 0.16 ppm wet wt) and feather (GM = 3.23 ppm) samples were
   correlated (r = 0.69, P = 0.0001). Although nestlings had lower mercury
   concentrations in feathers than did adults (GM = 6.03 ppm), the feather
   mercury levels in nestlings and adults from the same nest were
   correlated (r = 0.63, P < 0.02). Mercury concentration in blood of
   captive adult eagles (GM = 0.23 ppm) was similar to Florida nestlings
   but some Florida nestlings had blood mercury concentrations up to 0.61
   ppm, more than twice as high as captive adults. Feather mercury
   concentrations in both nestlings and adults exceeded those in captive
   eagles, but concentrations in all tissues were similar to, or lower
   than, those in bald eagles from other wild populations. Although mercury
   concentrations in Florida eagles are below those that cause mortality,
   they are in the range of concentrations that can cause behavioral
   changes or reduce reproduction. We recommend periodic monitoring of
   mercury in Florida bald eagles for early detection of mercury increases
   before negative effects on reproduction occur.}},

Abstract = {{The first successful trials with stationary `crest' nets to monitor the
   nocturnal fluxes of larval fish crossing reef margins in both eastern
   and western Australia are described. Lengthy deployments were possible
   on Ningaloo Reef, north-western Australia, because that system is
   topographically suitable: i.e. a fringing barrier reef where surf
   produces a constant flow into a coastal lagoon. Sampling on 85 nights
   between October 1994 and March 1995 revealed a rich larval fish fauna
   (56474 individuals) dominated by pelagic juveniles nearing settlement
   stage. Variations in the daily catches of replicate nets (200 m apart)
   were highly correlated, showing the suitability of this technique for
   monitoring larval supply. Another trial (five nights) was made at One
   Tree Reef, southern Great Barrier Reef. On nocturnal flood tides, when
   rising water first spilled into the lagoon, triplicate nets caught many
   presettlement fish (47797 individuals) in this flow. The behaviour of
   some taxa clearly assisted their transport through the surf. Despite the
   successful short-term deployments at One Tree, there may be limited
   potential to deploy this gear elsewhere on the Great Barrier Reef
   because of unsuitable flow regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Settlement and recruitment of the apogonids Apogon doederleini (Jordan
   \& Snyder) and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus (Cuvier) to continuous
   reef were examined at One Tree Island, southern Great Barrier Reef. Many
   settled to patch reefs in sand habitat. Moreover, peaks in settlement
   (over five to six days) corresponded to peak catches of potential
   settlers in ichthyoplankton nets at the reef crest. Few newly settled
   (<20 mm standard length) apogonids were found on continuous reef where
   juveniles and adults were abundant. A similar pattern was found on the
   reef slope outside the lagoon, but total abundance of both species was
   low in this environment. Results of tagging with tetracycline, diel
   censuses of patch reefs, and examination of gut contents indicated that
   fish of all size classes moved from daytime sites and foraged at night.
   Recruitment to continuous reef appears, particularly in A. doederleini,
   to take place in two phases: potential settlers enter the lagoon at
   night and settle into sand rubble habitats; fish feed at night and their
   night-time excursions increase with the size of the fish until they move
   to continuous reef as Phase 2. The monitoring of continuous reef would
   not have detected patterns of settlement to One Tree Island.}},

Abstract = {{The redevelopment of disused docks around Liverpool into areas suitable
   for shops, offices, housing and recreational watersports has
   necessitated the maintenance of good water quality in these areas. The
   main source of water to the docks is the River Mersey, which contains
   high concentrations of nutrients, encouraging algal blooms - including
   potentially nuisance species - in the enclosed dock basins. Since 1988
   an extensive monitoring programme has been run sampling the hydrography,
   plankton and benthos of the docks. During this period there has been an
   improvement in water quality, including a reduction in summer
   phytoplankton biomass and anoxic bottom water. There are strong
   indications that phytoplankton biomass has been severely reduced by the
   filter feeding of Mytilus edulis. Changes in the composition of the
   benthic community since 1988 suggest that the large population of M.
   edulis is now suffering from limited recruitment. The long-term
   development and stability of the system is discussed with reference to
   community succession and its link to ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, Sydney's domestic and industrial sewage was discharged
   to the Tasman Sea through outfalls at the cliff-face at North Head,
   Bondi and Malabar, NSW, Australia. To overcome the resulting pollution
   of nearby beaches, three deepwater outfalls were constructed and
   effluent is now discharged from the seabed in 60-80 m of water some 2-4
   km offshore. An environmental monitoring programme was set up to assess
   the impacts of the new deepwater outfalls. This study describes the
   underlying philosophy and sampling designs of this monitoring programme.
   In doing so, it provides an overview of the pre-commissioning phase
   studies of the ichthyoplanktonic, demersal fish and soft-bottom
   communities. The abundances of the organisms comprising the three
   communities fluctuated in space and time. This sampling highlighted
   marked differences in the depth-distributions of larval fish. Trawling
   and long lining further reinforced technique-dependent selectivity and
   overcame problems of environmental heterogeneity, which are often
   manifest when sampling fish populations. Power analyses using data for
   six families of polychaetes demonstrate the concerns over Type II errors
   in environmental impact assessment, and this paper suggests ways of
   addressing this issue. Finally, an experimental design is discussed that
   incorporates estimates of spatial and temporal variation, thus allowing
   better (unconfounded) assessments of the impacts of sewage-disposal on
   marine biological communities.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid post war development of Hong Kong as a centre of population,
   industry and commerce far outstripped the provision of sewers,
   wastewater treatment and disposal facilities. A legacy of marine
   pollution remains; the Government is now addressing this problem through
   the implementation of an ambitious sewage strategy. At the core of the
   strategy lies a major sewerage programme and the construction of new
   sewage treatment plants and marine disposal outfalls. The authors
   outline the background to recent sewerage and related infrastructure
   development in Hong Kong and discuss the scope and role of an outfall
   performance verification monitoring programme. This monitoring programme
   also is intended to identify the need for future improvements to the
   system in order to ensure that statutory Water Quality Objectives can be
   achieved and maintained. This work is seen as an essential element in
   the strategy for providing a cost effective treatment and disposal
   system. The early stages of a programme to measure the effects of major
   sewage outfalls on coastal waters is described. Initial work in the
   north-west New Territories of Hong Kong has focused on understanding the
   dilution and dispersion of sewage plumes. Ongoing and recently completed
   plume tracking work, which has made use of innovative tools such as
   radio-isotope tracers, dye fluorescence, ADCP and other water quality
   sensors multiplexed to three dimensional positional recording systems is
   reviewed. The subsequent interpretation of these results and their value
   in assessing outfall performance is considered. The success of this work
   is discussed and the lessons for future monitoring programmes are
   identified. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The study is based on 27 disc-trenched reforestation areas on dryish
   upland sites in central Finland. These regeneration areas were monitored
   from since the establishment year 1987 up to seventh growing season in
   1993. All regeneration areas were planted with pine (Pinus sylvestris
   L.) and measurements were made on permanent sample plots 50 m(2) of
   size. These, altogether 300 sample plots were inventoried in the autumns
   1987, 1988-89, 1990 and in the summer 1993. The survival of planted
   seedlings and the dynamics of natural seedling establishment were the
   most important variables in the research.
   The survival rate of barerooted pine seedlings was higher than that of
   containerized seedlings. This was partly due to the bad health condition
   of containerized pine seedlings in the spring 1987. In some seedling
   lots, used the roots of containerized seedlings had frozen in the
   previous winter. The loss of planted seedlings in the first four growing
   seasons was about 20\% in the barerooted seedlings and about 30\% in the
   containerized seedlings. The main reasons for the losses of planted
   seedlings were the damage caused by pine weevils and grass and the
   mistakes made in the planting operation. After the fourth growing season
   the population of planted seedlings seemed to be stable. In the seventh
   growing season there were about 1 400 viable planted seedlings per
   hectare.
   Natural seedlings were rare in the first growing seasons. The invasion
   of natural pine seedlings took place in the second and in the third
   growing season but the amount of broadleaved seedlings continued to
   increase at least up to the-seventh growing season. Altogether, the
   number of natural conifer seedlings was about 2 000 per hectare and the
   number of birches (Betula pendula and B. pubescens) originating from
   seed summed up to 10 000 per hectare. Additionally the number of sprouts
   and other broad-leaved trees, mainly rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), was about
   6 000 per hectare on the average in the seventh growing season.}},

   species have developed multiple mechanisms of resistance. Molecular
   genetics is bringing new understanding of the genetic basis of
   resistance and the ways in which resistance evolves and spreads. Recent
   molecular characterization of several resistance genes has provided the
   means to study the evolution, population genetics and ecology of
   resistance at the genotypic level. This paper will review recent
   discoveries of resistance mechanisms, contributions of genetic
   technology to monitoring for resistance, and will consider the role of
   molecular genetics in assessing the risks of resistance to new
   pesticides and pest control strategies, including transgenic methods.}},

Abstract = {{Fisheries biologists frequently conduct studies to assess abundance and
   size structure of reservoir fish populations. These investigations
   include: (1) surveys and monitoring studies designed to inventory
   fisheries resources and track trends in various fisheries parameters,
   and (2) experimental and manipulative studies conducted to evaluate fish
   population responses to management programs or system manipulations. The
   distinction between these types of studies is often blurred, however,
   because survey and monitoring data frequently are used to assess
   experimental manipulations or management recommendations. Reservoir
   survey and monitoring programs often follow procedures that lack proper
   design and are infrequently evaluated and updated. Many studies use
   various forms of nonprobability sampling and subjectively chosen fixed
   stations, which limit statistical inference to those sites sampled and
   restricts potential uses of the data. With the increasing cost of data
   collection and the potential consequences of management strategies based
   on biased data, alternative sampling methods are needed. Various forms
   of probability sampling (especially stratified random sampling) provide
   a means for increasing the utility, reliability, and credibility of
   fisheries data. Probability sampling procedures also yield data that can
   be applied more easily to unanticipated questions and issues that may
   arise in the future. Coupled with geographic information systems,
   probability samples enhance the ability of reservoir fisheries managers
   to visualize and interpret spatial patterns in fish populations and to
   predict fishery responses to management actions or habitat
   manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the application of adaptive management to development of a
   system-wide approach for protecting and enhancing populations of
   salmonids Oncorhynchus spp. in the Columbia River basin. This represents
   one of the few applications of the concept to an ecosystem level
   recovery program. The use of adaptive management in the Columbia River
   basin has had mixed results. While a variety of actions in the basin
   have been promoted on the basis of their potential for adaptive
   learning, few were implemented as part of an explicit learning plan. As
   a result, it is difficult to identify significant scientific questions
   that have been resolved in the basin through the use of adaptive
   management. Many of the scientific questions that prompted the call for
   adaptive management in the basin remain. However, the development of a
   system model and the broad-based participation encouraged by adaptive
   management have aided development of a vision of the basin as an
   integrated system, a key feature in managing an area of the size and
   jurisdictional diversity of the Columbia River basin. It also has
   fostered an appreciation among decision makers of the impacts of
   scientific uncertainty and biological variability. Despite the practical
   difficulties of using an adaptive approach, the learning emphasis of
   adaptive management will be required if we are to manage ecosystems. An
   adaptive approach implies, foremost, an overt commitment to learning
   while moving forward with needed management actions. Because of the
   broad range of questions likely to face the ecosystem manager, an
   adaptive approach needs to include a similarly broad range of tools
   including manipulative management experiments, research, and monitoring.
   These should be focused through the use of an explicit learning plan
   that links goals, uncertainties, and actions. Such a plan presents an
   organized approach to learning and could prevent the diffusion of
   activities that can occur under the banner of adaptive management.}},

Title = {{A small predator removal experiment to protect North Island weka

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that predation on eggs and chicks by ferrets (Mustela
   furo) and cats (Felis catus) was limiting the productivity of North
   Island weka (Gallirallus australis greyi), was tested by removing
   predators from the home ranges of four breeding pairs of weka.
   Reproduction by four other breeding pairs was monitored to provide a
   control. I was not able to follow the breeding success of some weka
   because they died or removed their radio transmitters. Two of the pairs
   breeding in predator-removal areas reared five chicks to independence,
   while two control pairs reared no chicks to independence after three
   breeding attempts. It was not possible to draw solid conclusions from
   group comparison data gained from so few individuals. Because it is
   necessary to identify the factors preventing weka recovery now, I
   suggest an alternative way to gather reliable data about rare species
   like weka.
   Single subject experimental designs like those developed in the social
   sciences offer an alternative route for investigating agents of decline
   in rare species; such a design would have been preferable to the one
   used in the present study. A common experimental procedure in single
   subject studies is the A-B-A series or some variant of it where A and B
   refer to experimental conditions with A being the control and B the
   treatment. Treatments are switched on and off for individuals (e.g.,
   animals, or areas) which are considered representative of the study
   population. Well designed, replicated single subject studies might allow
   data to be used even after unplanned alterations to experimental
   conditions. The results of such studies would be cumulative,
   interpretable and more readily publishable. For some species all that
   may be required is a reanalysis of existing data.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of ship rats (Rattus rattus), Norway rats (R. norvegicus),
   feral house mice (Mus musculus), stoats (Mustela erminea), weasels (M.
   nivalis), and ferrets (M. furo) were sampled with killtraps every three
   months from November 1982 to November 1987 in logged and unlogged native
   forest and in exotic plantations of various ages at Pureora Forest Park,
   central North Island. Mice (n=522 collected) were fewest in unlogged
   native forest, more abundant in road edge cutover forest, and most
   abundant in a young (5-10 year old) plantation. Traps catching most mice
   were set in dense ground cover under a low, sparse canopy. Ship rats
   (n=1793) were absent from the young plantation, present but not abundant
   in older exotic forest, and abundant in all native forest regardless of
   logging history. Traps set on warmer, steeper sites caught most ship
   rats, and those set in early successional habitats caught fewest. There
   was a marked reciprocal relationship between the distributions of ship
   rats and of mice: the proportion of mice in the total catch of rodents
   decreased significantly at the least, disturbed forest sites (P<0.001).
   Most (81\%) Norway rats (n=43) were caught in a single trap in unlogged
   native forest on the bank of a stream. Stoats (n=57) were most abundant
   in the older exotic plantations; weasels (n=16) in the young plantation
   and along road edges in native forest; and ferrets (n=11) in unlogged
   native forest. Hedgehogs (n=290) were common in unlogged native forest
   far from any roads and also in older exotic forest. Our data suggest
   that selective logging and conversion to exotics have different effects
   on each of the six species we monitored. We hypothesise that (1)
   selective logging is likely to stimulate temporary increases in the
   numbers of mice and weasels, but not rats or stoats, and (2) after
   conversion to exotic forest, mice and occasionally weasels will be
   abundant at first but will gradually be replaced by ship rats and stoats
   as the forest matures.}},

Abstract = {{In Switzerland, aerial photos are indispensable tools for research into
   ecosystems and their management. Every six years since 1950, the whole
   of Switzerland has been systematically surveyed by aerial photos. In the
   forestry field, these documents not only provide invaluable information
   but also give support to field activities such as the drawing up of tree
   population maps, intervention planning, precise positioning of the upper
   forest limit, evaluation of forest damage and rates of tree growth. Up
   to now, the analysis of aerial photos has been carried out by
   specialists who painstakingly examine every photograph, which makes it a
   very long, exacting and expensive job.
   The IMT-DMT of the EPFL and Antenne romande of FNP, aware of the special
   interest involved and the necessity of automated classification of
   aerial photos, have pooled their resources to develop a software
   programme capable of differentiating between single trees, copses and
   dense forests.
   The developed algorithms detect the crowns of the trees and the surface
   of the orthogonal projection. From the shadow of each tree they
   calculate its height. They also determine the position of the tree in
   the Swiss national co-ordinate thanks to the implementation of a numeric
   altitude model.
   For the future, we have the prospect of many new and better uses of
   aerial photos being available to us, particularly where isolated stands
   are concerned and also when evolutions based on a diachronic series of
   photos have to be assessed: from timberline monitoring in the research
   on global change to the exploitation of wooded pastures on small surface
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{The results of the monitoring of woodpecker abundance on the island of
   Aasla (Finnish Baltic coast) during 1979-1995 are presented and
   analysed. Population fluctuations on Aasla were similar to those in
   mainland Finland in the case of the Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canus
   and the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius. Breeding abundance of Black
   Woodpeckers was negatively correlated with snow depth and positively
   correlated with temperature in February. Also, breeding densities of
   Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major and Lesser Spotted Woodpecker
   Dendrocopos minor correlated positively with mean January and February
   temperatures. We suggest that several mild winters in the second part of
   the study period (1988-1995), are the primary reasons for the
   continuously high population densities of Grey-headed and Black
   Woodpeckers. We did not find any evidence indicating competition between
   Grey-headed and Black Woodpeckers. We stress the need for creating
   foraging substrates (e.g. standing dead wood) as food sources for
   woodpecker species in boreal forests under severe winter conditions.}},

Journal = {{PHYTOPARASITICA}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The effect of previous infestation by the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii
   Glover) on resistance of cotton seedlings to further infestation by the
   same insect, was examined in the laboratory. Seedlings-which survived a
   heavy infestation and produced new leaves, were recolonized artificially
   and the fate of the colonizers was monitored. The two cotton varieties
   used in the experiments differed in resistance to aphid colonization,
   and a few seedlings were initially unsuitable for aphid colonization.
   Aphids transferred to new leaves on previously infested plants were not
   so successful as on uninfested seedlings and repeated attempts over a
   few weeks were sometimes required until a colony became established.
   Reinfested plants often showed no visible signs of stress, but the aphid
   colonies were frequently of the `yellow dwarf' morph, indicating that
   the plants had been stressed after the first infestation. We suggest
   that damage caused by the first infestation - and not the production of
   some excess metabolites - is the reason for the lower success on
   previously infested plants.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit-set and seed weight variation was studied in a population of
   Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. vulgaris (Fabaceae) in northwestern Spain.
   The plants produce several shoots, each bearing two to four
   inflorescences that open one at a time from bottom to top. Fruit-set,
   seed-pod weight and seed weight were found to be significantly higher in
   proximal inflorescences than in distal inflorescences of the same shoot;
   mean seed weight was up to three times higher in proximal than in distal
   inflorescences. By contrast, none of the three variables varied
   significantly among plants or among shoots of the same plant. Similarly,
   none of the three variables differed significantly between early- and
   late-flowering plants, or between plants monitored in 1993 and in 1994.
   These results are compatible with the view that shoots function as
   semiautonomous units as regards resource allocation, and that within the
   shoot resources are preferentially allocated to proximal (=
   early-opening) inflorescences. In the plants studied, the ratio of
   seed-pod weight to seed weight was fairly constant, suggesting that the
   pod is important for seed success.}},

Abstract = {{This study monitored activity of eastern equine encephalitis virus
   (EEEV) in bird populations in southern NJ. Culiseta melanura was used as
   an index for the EEEV levels in birds. Reverse transcriptase polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-PCR) and wet-chick/IFA techniques were employed for
   EEEV detection. A total of 5,174 females comprising 501 pools were
   tested from coastal and inland sites. Sixty-three pools tested positive
   by the RT-PCR compared to 6 pools tested positive by the wet-chick/IFA
   technique. Significantly, more pools tested positive from the coastal
   sites by both techniques, but a higher minimum field infection rate
   (MFIR)/1,000 females was detected by RT-PCR from the inland sites. A
   maximum MFIR was detected by the IFA technique from the coastal sites,
   suggesting more infectious virus was transmitted to birds at these
   sites. Early EEEV activity was detected in June from Dennisville and the
   1(st) positive pool of the season consisting of gravid females was
   collected on 6/7/96. The 1(st) positive pool detected by the
   wet-chick/IFA technique was from Dennisville on 7/5/96 and was the
   earliest detection of EEEV by this method in 15 years. A comparison of
   the 2 techniques showed RT-PCR detected a maximum percentage of positive
   pools in late-blood-fed females; whereas the maximum percentage of
   positive unfed pools was detected by the wet-chick/IFA technique. The
   1995 vector surveillance season differed ii-om 1994 in having peak
   mosquito populations in June and July and the populations greatly
   reduced from August-October.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) was conducted
   on Goethe State Forest, Levy County, Florida, in 1994 and 1995. Four
   hundred fifty-one living cavity trees, active and inactive, were
   located. The majority of living cavity trees (97\%) were longleaf pines
   (Pinus palustris). Mean age of cavity trees was 123.6 years (N = 108).
   One hundred ninety-seven living cavity trees occurred in 26 clusters,
   and 25 of these clusters were active in 1995. Nestling production was
   confirmed in 73\% and 65\% of the active clusters monitored in 1994 and
   1995, respectively. To maintain the red-cockaded woodpecker population
   at its current status, management activities should focus on improving
   habitat quality in active clusters, establishing replacement stands to
   provide future nesting and roosting habitat, and providing adequate
   foraging habitat. To enhance the population, recruitment stands of
   suitable nesting and roosting habitat should be established, including
   construction of artificial cavities and cavity starts.}},

Abstract = {{Expansion of the black bear (Ursus americanus) population outside White
   River National Wildlife Refuge, Arkansas, has caused local citizens to
   request reduction of the population. An estimate of black bear
   population size is necessary before any management recommendations can
   be made. We used 2 census methods to estimate population size. Hunter
   surveys of bear sightings during the 2-day firearm deer hunt were used
   in 1994 to estimate population size with a Petersen-Lincoln estimator.
   The survey yielded a population estimate of 213 bears (95\% CI =
   129-297). We used cameras triggered by infrared monitors to photograph
   bears visiting bait sites over a ir-day period during August 1995.
   Infrared monitors recorded 176 events, resulting in 87 photographs of 23
   different bears. We used 2 separate models to calculate population sizes
   using data from cameras. Program CAPTURE calculated a population size of
   348 (95\% CI = 300-396) bears for the refuge. A Minta-Mangel
   mark-resight model calculated a population size of 464 (95\% CI =
   348-638) bears for the refuge. The hunter survey population estimate was
   low even with the probable violation of the assumption that tags were
   not lost. Population estimates based on the photographs were different
   because the actual number of bears on the study area of sampling is
   unknown. Problems with the hunter survey and Minta-Mangel population
   estimates provided evidence that the program CAPTURE population estimate
   is the most reliable.}},

   monitored at the Appleby Research Orchard near Nelson (1994/1996) in two
   apple cultivars as part of an experimental Integrated Fruit Production
   programme which included the insect growth regulator insecticide
   tebufenozide. The aphid population increased dramatically during the
   first season in one cultivar ('Sturmer Pippin') from mid February and
   reached 90\% shoot infestation by late summer. Parasitism of the aphid
   by the specific endoparasitoid, Aphelinus mali (Haldeman), was first
   recorded in late March 1995 and peaked at 13\% by the end of April 1995
   when monitoring ceased. In the second season the parasitoid was present
   from early summer and >80\% parasitism was recorded by late April 1996.
   Aphid control was achieved without the need for specific aphicide
   sprays. The results indicate the potential for biological control of
   woolly apple aphid by A. mali within a selective insecticide programme.}},

   expansion and mucification in vivo and in vitro}},
Journal = {{REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{935-943}},
Abstract = {{The cell cycle characteristics of mouse cumulus granulosa cells were
   determined before, during and following their expansion and mucification
   in vivo and in vitro. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COG) were recovered from
   ovarian follicles or oviducts of prepubertal mice previously injected
   with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) or a mixture of PMSG and
   human chorionic gonadotrophin (PMSG+hCG) to synchronize follicle
   differentiation and ovulation. Cell cycle parameters were determined by
   monitoring DNA content of cumulus cell nuclei, collected under
   rigorously controlled conditions, by flow cytometry. The proportion of
   cumulus cells in three cell cycle-related populations (G(0)/G(1); S;
   G(2)/M) was calculated before and after exposure to various experimental
   conditions in vivo or in vitro. About 30\% of cumulus cells recovered
   from undifferentiated (compact) COC isolated 43-45 h after PMSG
   injections were in S phase and 63\% were in G(0)/G(1) (2C DNA content).
   Less than 10\% of the cells were in the G(2)/M population. Cell cycle
   profiles of cumulus cells recovered from mucified COC (oviducal) after
   PMSG+hCG-induced ovulation varied markedly from those collected before
   hCG injection and were characterized by the relative absence of S-phase
   cells and an increased proportion of cells in G(0)/G(1). Cell cycle
   profiles of cumulus cells collected from mucified COC recovered from
   mouse ovarian follicles before ovulation (9-10 h after hCG) were also
   characterized by loss of S-phase cells and an increased G(0)/G(1)
   population. Results suggest that changes in cell cycle parameters in
   vivo are primarily mediated in response to physiological changes that
   occur in the intrafollicular environment initiated by the ovulatory
   stimulus. A similar lack of S-phase cells was observed in mucified
   cumulus cells collected 24 h after exposure in vitro of compact COC to
   dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (DBcAMP), follicle-stimulating
   hormone or epidermal growth factor (EGF). Additionally, the proportion
   of cumulus cells in G(2)/M was enhanced in COC exposed to DBcAMP,
   suggesting that cell division was inhibited under these conditions.
   Thus, both the G(1) --> S-phase and G(2) --> M-phase transitions in the
   cell cycle appear to be amenable to physiological regulation. Time
   course studies revealed dose-dependent changes in morphology occurred
   within 6 h of exposure in vitro of COC to EGF or DBcAMP. Results suggest
   that the disappearance of the S-phase population is a consequence of a
   decline in the number of cells beginning DNA synthesis and exit of cells
   from the S phase following completion of DNA synthesis. Furthermore,
   loss of proliferative activity in cumulus cells appears to be closely
   associated with COC expansion and mucification, whether induced under
   physiological conditions in vivo or in response to a range of hormonal
   stimuli in vitro, The observations indicate that several
   signal-transducing pathways mediate changes in cell cycle parameters
   during cumulus cell differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{We suggest monitoring genetic diversity (= effective number) in breeding
   populations with a new concept `'status number'', which is half the
   inverse of the average coancestry, including the coancestry of the
   individual with itself. Formulae and numerical evaluations are presented
   for status number, average coancestry and inbreeding for different
   breeding systems. Some properties of status number are discussed.
   Our simulation study showed that genetic diversity was best preserved
   over generations by repeated selfing. Methods that use equal parental
   representation preserved genetic diversity better than panmixis. Small
   sublines preserved genetic diversity better than larger sublines, this
   effect was notable only when subline size was extremely small (like
   repeated full-sib mating). Rapid declining in status number with the
   first generation turn overs seems unavoidable.}},

   season that were separated by a 5 to 9 day period of marked decreases in

   Orleans (includes data from Henderson \& Delaplane 1994) mean alate trap
   counts have increased with each year. These data indicate that Formosan

Abstract = {{Soil termiticides control subterranean termites by acting as chemical
   barriers, but they do not substantially suppress termite populations.
   Therefore, an effective termite population suppression technique is
   viewed as a highly desirable complement to soil treatment. Baiting
   strategies have attempted to suppress termite populations by
   administering slow-acting toxicants to termite feeding substrates. As an
   alternative to baits, this paper describes a new approach for delivering
   slow-acting toxicants, namely, via a transmissible coating which is
   applied directly to the cuticle of trapped termites. The coated termites
   are then released, the coating is groomed off by untreated termites, and
   the material is further circulated in the population by trophallaxis.
   Various toxicants were tested in a resin-based transmissible coating
   against the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes
   (Kollar) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae). Of the 11 compounds tested in the
   transmissible coating formulation, sulfluramid was the most effective.
   Petri dish tests demonstrated that a single resin-sulfluramid coated
   termite could kill up to 1,394 untreated termites. Further lab tests in
   soil cups and soil trays with up to 50,000 termites per test,
   consistently demonstrated greater than 95\% mortality when 5\% or 10\%
   of the termites were treated with the coating.
   Twenty urban field trials were initiated in 1993. The termite
   populations at these sites were characterized by the
   mark-release-recapture technique and other population estimators.
   Population estimates for the 20 sites ranged from 100,572 to 11,422,441
   with an average mean estimate of 1,931,917. Greater than 60\%
   suppression was achieved at 19 of the 20 sites after treatments in the
   first year. Surviving populations were further suppressed with smaller
   follow up treatments in 1994 and 1995. At 12 of the 20 sites which had
   not been expanded, the average number of termites trapped per visit in
   1995 declined by 92.6\% compared to 1993. At the other 8 sites which
   were expanded, new termite activity was mainly located in expanded areas
   and was largely suppressed by the end of 1995.
   Two block trials were initiated in 1994 on two heavily infested,
   residential, city blocks. Trap activity was strongly suppressed within
   both blocks by the end of 1994. Low trap activity and low termite yields
   were seen on both blocks In 1995 and further suppressed by small follow
   up treatments. The number of termites trapped in 1995 had declined by
   90.4\% on one block and had declined by 95.4\% on the other block.
   The field trials documented here are the largest ever reported for an
   alternative termite control system. In total, the 22 field trials
   encompassed 151 residential properties including two city blocks, tyro
   apartment complexes, two apartment buildings, one public housing complex
   and one park. A total of 1,282 traps were monitored, of which 631 traps
   were active. By the end of 1995 only 16 traps continued to be active at
   9 of the 22 sites. These tests establish the field efficacy of a
   transmissible coating containing sulfluramid as a viable strategy for
   subterranean termite population suppression under diverse urban
   conditions.}},

   (DowElanco - Sentricon Colony Elimination System(R)), were evaluated for
   the control of subterranean termites in Texas. Hydramethylnon bait was
   tested for one year at four structures infested with subterranean
   termites. Control of termites was not achieved; however, colony
   suppression, as indicated by the number of wood stakes attacked by
   termites, may have occurred at two locations. Hexaflumuron bait was
   tested for two years at seven structures infested with subterranean
   termites. Control of termites occurred at one location where more than
   17 Baitubes(R) were consumed. Colony suppression, as indicated by the
   number of monitoring stations attacked by termites, appears to have
   occurred at two structures. With both hydramethylnon and hexaflumuron,
   lack of termite activity at bait stations might indicate a reduction in
   colony population size (or elimination); however, independent monitoring
   stations (wooden stakes and wood blocks) used during these tests
   indicated that termites were present even though termites were not

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes preliminary results of three field studies of the
   efficacy of a prototype commercial baiting system using the chitin
   inhibitor hexaflumuron against the Formosan subterranean termite,
   Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae). Using
   mark-release-recapture methods, termite foraging populations at these
   three sites were estimated at 0.33 million, 0.94 million, and 5.35
   million. Following application of hexaflumuron baits, no termite
   activity has been detected at these locations for 24, 10, and 20 months,
   respectively. At these sites, the amount of bait consumed had a
   logarithmic relationship to the size of the estimated populations,
   although in each case there was a great deal of variation among the
   individual population estimates used to calculate the weighted-mean
   population estimate. We argue that monitoring of termite activity at
   unbaited foraging sites is essential in order to document bait efficacy
   without the confounding factors of bait deterrence and/or localized
   termite mortality at the site of bait application. We conclude that
   suppression or removal of the termite population to a level where
   termite activity can no longer be detected in unbaited monitoring
   stations, in the structure to be protected, or elsewhere in the
   immediate vicinity of the structure is the only practical goal of bait
   applications.}},

   Strip to measure size, mortality, fruiting, and recruitment, and to map
   the cacti in the plots. The data have been gathered since 1986. Plants

Abstract = {{Texas wildrice (Zizania texana Hitchc.), an endangered macrophyte, is
   endemic to the San Marcos River and Spring Lake in Hays County, Texas.
   Its population declined dramatically between 1940 and 1967. In a
   reintroduction program that was initiated in 1992, plants were
   transplanted into five microhabitats at a density of 10 plants/m(2).
   Seasonal monitoring identified an initial increase in plant size
   followed by high mortality in three of five sites. Data suggest that
   stem density is a good indicator of future transplant success and that
   current velocity is an important environmental factor associated with
   transplant success. However, herbivores have continually clipped
   reproductive culms just below the water surface. This limits transplants
   to clonal reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{A gene-dosage population was obtained by crossing two genotypes that
   were duplex for the GBSS allele. Nulliplex, simplex, duplex or
   triplex/quadruplex plants could be identified by monitoring the
   segregation of red and blue microspores after staining with iodine. GBSS
   activity was significantly different for all groups and showed an almost
   linear dosage effect for the wildtype GBSS gene. A dosage effect was
   found for amylose content that was not linear. The amylose content was
   similar for both the duplex and triplex/quadruplex group. Within the
   simplex group, differences in amylose content were found, which might be
   due to a different genetic background. There was no linear correlation
   between GBSS activity and amylose content. A certain level of GBSS
   activity led to a maximum amount of amylose, and further increase in
   GBSS activity did not result in a further increase in amylose content.
   The presence of one or more wildtype GBSS allele(s), and therefore the
   presence of amylose in the starch granules, had a great influence on the
   physico-chemical properties of the starch suspensions.}},

Abstract = {{In 1968, a direct water reclamation system from domestic sewage was
   pioneered in Windhoek, Namibia, to supplement the potable water supply
   to the city. This system went through a succession of modifications and
   improvements over the years, but consistently produced water of
   acceptable quality, as evidenced a comprehensive chemical,
   bacteriological, virological, and epidemiological monitoring. Now, in
   1995, Windhoek is again facing a shortfall of potable water in the light
   of a population increase (growing at 6\% to 8\% per annum) and
   increasing water demand, and is currently extending the water
   reclamation system from the previous 4800 to 21000 m(3).d(-1), the
   maximum attainable. All the components of the reclamation system are
   being reviewed and re-analyzed; demand management, diversion of some
   industrial effluents, wastewater treatment, water reclamation, oxidation
   and adsorption technologies, blending of reclaimed wastewater with other
   sources, buildup of salinity, treatment costs, and monitoring and
   quality control strategies. The practical experience at Windhoek
   demonstrates that a direct wastewater reclamation system is a practical,
   responsible way of augmenting potable water supplies in arid regions,
   but that it requires comprehensive planning, training and on-going
   commitment for its continued success. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.}},

Abstract = {{In the Athens Metropolitan area nearly 700,000 m(3) of effluent is
   produced per day which after its primary treatment is being discharged
   into the sea. A serious concern has been expressed by local
   municipalities and the government on wasting a valuable potential
   resource. An integrated approach has been selected, which takes into
   account the water resources management aspects, the growing population
   and the increasing demand for improving the environmental standards in
   the greater Athens area. The methodology developed includes: the
   geographical distribution of prospective users, the quantities required
   and the availability and cost of the existing sources, the quality
   standards required and the treatment needed per use, the associated
   public health and environmental hazards, the institutional and political
   aspects, the monitoring and control requirements, the social awareness
   and the need for education and public acceptance for effluent reuse. The
   various uses examined include: crop irrigation, irrigation of
   afforestated areas, industrial water supply and domestic non potable
   use, Twelve different reuse schemes were evaluated, The conclusions are
   of great interest, since the quantities of the available effluent are
   enormous and allow the development of an overall reuse strategy for a
   typical Mediterranean metropolitan area like Athens. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Marselisborg WWTP is designed for 220,000 population equivalent as an AB
   process i.e. biosorption followed by a BIO-DENITRO plant. The plant was
   designed to remove nitrate in summer only. It was designed to remove
   phosphorus by pre-precipitation in the biosorption process and by
   simultaneous precipitation in the biological tanks. Introduction of an
   on-line control system for the nitrogen removal made it possible to
   remove nitrate all year to effluent values 1-3 mg N/l below the effluent
   standard of 8 mg N/l. The control system automatically introduced about
   50\% longer denitrification time in the tanks. During the last 4 years,
   the amount of filtered COD has through optimization increased from 65\%
   to above 80\% in relation to total GOD. This in combination with the
   longer time without aeration in the biological ranks has made it
   possible to optimize biological phosphorus removal at the plant It is
   possible to remove about 400 kg P/d biological out of about 500 kg Pld.
   Strategies to run the biological P removal simultaneously with the
   nitrogen removal in the same biological tanks has been tested. It seems
   possible to control the biological phosphorus removal by modifying the
   on-line control system for the nitrogen removal. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{The reproductive characteristics of natural populations of meadow
   salsify were monitored between May 1990 and October 1991. Plants in
   even-aged populations did not produce seeds prior to the second winter
   and plants in uneven-aged populations died after seed production
   suggesting that meadow salsify at this site is a monocarpic perennial
   and not a true biennial. Delayed seed production may enhance abundance
   of this species by increasing the size of its bud bank. Plants of
   uneven-aged populations flowered over a range of root crown diameters;
   the percentage of plants bearing flowers increased with increasing root
   crown diameters. The minimum root crown diameter at which plants
   flowered in 1990 and 1991 was 0.2 and 0.6 cm respectively demonstrating
   that factor(s) other than plant size regulate flowering in this species.
   Seed production ranged between 100 to 850 seeds per plant. Total number
   of flower heads per plant and florets per plant were positively
   correlated with each other and with the root crown diameter. Root crown
   diameter is, therefore, a good indicator of potential fecundity in
   meadow salsify. Greater seed production by larger plants may compensate,
   at least in part, for the high juvenile mortality and longer generation
   time in this species. The results suggest that prolific seed production
   and long vegetative survival are important strategies in the maintenance
   of meadow salsify populations.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in germination behaviour of meadow salsify seeds buried
   at different depths, and survivorship of seed and plant populations were
   investigated. Freshly matured seeds were mixed with sterilized soil,
   placed into nylon mesh bags, and buried at three soil depths in a meadow
   salsify-infested rangeland. Two germination peaks were observed: one in
   the fall, 2 to 3 mo after burial, and a second the following spring.
   Burial depth affected seed dormancy. The number of seeds with enforced
   dormancy, and innate or induced dormancy, increased with burial depth in
   the 1989 cohort, and the number with enforced dormancy increased in the
   1990 cohort. Burial depth also affected seed survivorship. The
   survivorship curves for 1989 and 1990 seed cohorts were not different as
   indicated by the Logrank test. The seed population was nearly depleted
   after 9 to 10 mo of burial; less than 3\% of the buried seeds remained
   viable after 13 mo. About 50\% of the plants monitored in a natural
   meadow salsify population in 1990 died before winter, and an additional
   35\% died during winter. The mortality of the remaining plants during
   the second growing season was very low Only 12\% of the 1990 cohort
   remained in October 1991. Mortality of meadow salsify plants was
   density-independent.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring programmes are often confined by limited funds.
   By use of Monte Carlo simulations and GLM procedures, it is examined to
   what extent trends documented for some Norwegian seabird populations
   could have been obtained with less field effort. Changes in both
   breeding and wintering numbers are analysed. To minimise bias from
   merging different populations, only regional trends are considered. The
   results strongly suggest that some populations can be monitored
   adequately by less effort than that applied, i.e. still ensuring that
   the counts will reveal the various sources of variation in reliable
   proportions to the total variance in bird numbers. This may be achieved
   either by reducing the number of plots or by counting them less
   frequently, for example in alternate years only. General advise with
   respect to what changes deserve special attention from conservation
   authorities, and a discussion of the principles and considerations which
   should be taken into account when designing monitoring programmes for
   seabirds are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Clevenger, P.A. \& Purroy F.J. 1996: Sign surveys for estimating trend
   of a remnant brown bear Ursus arctos population in northern Spain. -
   Wildl. Biol. 2: 275-281.
   Brown bears Ursus arctos in Spain's Cantabrian Mountains are continuing
   to decline in numbers despite their protected status. Recovery plans for
   this population stress the need for monitoring of occupied habitat using
   non-intrusive methods. A population monitoring program to estimate bear
   abundance indices by quantifying tracks and scats (sign surveys) along a
   network of survey routes was designed. Each route was divided into
   consecutive 1.6-km segments, which comprised the basic sampling unit,
   and were assumed to provide independent observations. During a 3-year
   pilot study surveys were run twice per year, totaling 70 routes,
   including 950 segments, and covering over 1,500 km annually. Averages of
   0.06 sign per segment were observed; only 4\% of the segments had sign.
   It is concluded that the present sampling scheme does not provide enough
   statistical power to accurately detect significant declines in
   population level. The difficulties of monitoring trends of low density
   populations using surveys are recognized. However, by increasing the
   sampling intensity, more reliable information and greater precision of
   the population trend estimate should be obtainable. Thus, a future
   monitoring strategy should be based on increasing sampling intensity and
   closely monitoring bear distribution and occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Biotronics has been involved, under NASA sponsorship, in a wide ranging
   research and development program for instrumentation used in the
   monitoring and control of controlled environment agriculture. This
   program has embraced both chemical monitoring of plant nutrient

   these same solutions. This paper emphasizes the microbiological
   monitoring aspects of this program. In contrast to traditional methods
   of microbiological analysis based on culturing, staining and microscopic
   observation, the development described here is based on spectroscopic
   measurements, more specifically spectral fluorometry. The rationale,
   objectives, analytical methods and new instrumentation employed in the
   development of an on-line microbiological analyzer (MBA) are presented
   in some detail. Finally, the signal processing/pattern recognition
   methods used to evaluate the spectral data and produce estimates of
   microbial populations are described along with experimental test results
   to conclude the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling procedure and plant parts which are sampled strongly depend on
   the scope of the investigation. In contrast to sampling of abiotic
   components trace element concentrations of plant materials are strongly
   dependent on plant age, organ and tissue function, genotypic character
   of uptake, translocation and allocation, and are modified by the impact
   of other organisms. The consequences of these dynamic processes are
   considerable differences in element matrices. After the identification
   of the individual in the field the aim of the investigation will decide
   on the plant part(s) to be sampled, either at random or selectively. The
   most frequently taken plant parts in space and time are the leaves,
   either deciduous or evergreen. Leaf age, their position and insertion on
   the plant, their longevity, infestations by pathogens, injury by
   herbivores, and exposure to atmospheric components determine the element
   concentration; therefore a rigid sampling protocol is necessary. Due to
   their different chemical compositions, twigs and stems have to be
   separated into bark inclusive of phloem and wood. Exposure to
   precipitation and colonisation by epiphytes and bark decomposers have to
   be noted. In the case of roots, many chemical elements are only adsorbed
   to the root cell walls and are not, or only to very low degree,
   translocated to the other root cell components and from roots to shoots.
   In addition to high fragility of fine roots and root hairs and their
   strong association with soil particles and soil organic matter, roots of
   most plant species have an intimate symbiotic association with
   mycorrhizal fungi. The change in the degree of infestation with
   endomycorrhizal fungi during one growing season and the change of
   ectomycorrhizal partners during life history are important aspects of
   sampling for monitoring purposes. The great variation of rooting depth
   during ontogeny, dependent on soil conditions, requires control of this
   parameter in the field. A protocol for random and selected sampling will
   be presented.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists have hypothesized that an increase in the biomass of
   piscivorous fish in lakes will cause a decrease in populations of
   planktivorous fish, an increase in the size of herbivorous zooplankton
   and a decrease in the biomass of phytoplankton. Here we present an
   experimental test of whether the effects of largemouth bass (Micropterus
   salmoides) cascade to the planktivorous fish, zooplankton and
   phytoplankton of a 15-ha water storage reservoir. A pilot study
   indicated that the reservoir was eutrophic with dense populations of
   planktivorous fish dominated by threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense). No
   piscivorous fish were present in the reservoir. We conducted a one-month
   mesocosm experiment using water and plankton from the reservoir showing
   that the presence of threadfin shad reduced large-sized zooplankton and
   increased the productivity and biomass of phytoplankton. To test whether
   the effects of piscivorous fish could cascade to the plankton, we
   assessed the effects of the addition of piscivorous largemouth bass on
   the planktivorous fish, zooplankton and biomass of phytoplankton of the
   reservoir by monitoring the reservoir during the year before and the two
   years after largemouth bass were stocked. In the second year after the
   addition of largemouth bass, the number of planktivorous fish decreased
   and the relative abundance of threadfin shad declined. Although the
   abundance of cladocerans increased after the addition of largemouth
   bass, the average size of zooplankton did not change. We did not detect
   changes in chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, or concentrations of total
   phosphorus and total nitrogen as a result of the addition of largemouth
   bass.}},

Abstract = {{Movements of the elephant population of Samburu and Laikipia Districts
   in northern Kenya were studied between 1990 and 1992. This population
   consists of about 3000 animals, and is the largest existing in Kenya
   primarily outside protected areas. Radio-tracking of a sample of twenty
   females indicated that a portion of the population, estimated at 800
   individuals, moved a distance of up to 140 km north from the cattle
   ranches of Laikipia to the drier pastoralist areas of Samburu twice a
   year, during the two rainy seasons. Six elephants from this
   sub-population were monitored. Their movements gave the appearance of a
   regular migration between small dry season ranges and larger wet season
   ranges. Northward movements were associated with rainfall in the Samburu
   range land, and the return to the south was related to the drying up of
   temporary water sources. Until the 1970s the majority of elephants in
   the area were resident in Samburu. It is suggested that the main reasons
   for the development of long distance movements were the change in the
   dominant vegetation in Laikipia from grassland to bushland and an
   increase in the number of permanent water sources, together with an
   upsurge in poaching in Samburu in the 1970s. The reason for the
   continuation of these movements, despite the recent decrease in
   poaching, may be competition for water with the increased human
   population in Samburu. In contrast to Samburu, the Laikipia ranch lands
   have abundant permanent water, and little human disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{An aerial sample count of large mammals and ostriches was carried out in
   the Waza National Park, Cameroon, using systematic transect sampling.
   Total population estimates are given and distribution maps are presented
   for seven species. Results are compared with three previous estimates.
   Population sizes of giraffe, roan antelope, and topi showed a limited
   increase since 1977. Rather surprisingly, the population of kobs, the
   most abundant larger herbivore, had increased dramatically. Red-fronted
   gazelle and ostrich seemed to maintain their stock. Elephants showed a
   significant increase of 9.3\% per annum since 1977. It is recommended
   that quantitative data be collected on the increasing elephant crop
   damages and that measures be taken to limit human/elephant conflicts.
   The Acacia seyal zone appeared to be an important wildlife habitat. It
   is suggested that this habitat should be permanently monitored given the
   increase in wildlife numbers and the changes in local hydrological
   conditions.
   The cost of the aerial survey was about US\$2.30 per km(2), a quite
   expensive operation for local low-budget Wildlife Department and
   Research Institutes.}},

Abstract = {{Genetically identical (isogenic) fish could be important experimental
   animals in aquacultural, genetic and biomedical research. Homozygous
   clones and isogenic hybrids are the two classes of isogenic research
   fish, Homozygous rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were produced by
   androgenesis followed by blockage of the first cleavage division, Clonal
   lines were produced in the following generation by another round of
   androgenesis and cleavage blockage, or gynogenesis followed by retention
   of the second polar body. Isogenic hybrids were produced by crossing
   homozygous individuals. The developmental stability of isogenic fish was
   estimated by comparing the fluctuating asymmetry and variance of four
   bilateral meristic traits in homozygous fish, isogenic hybrids and
   outbred fish. The homozygous fish were significantly more asymmetrical
   and showed higher variance in total counts than either the isogenic
   hybrids or outbred fish, indicating reduced in fitness in this group.
   There was no significant difference in asymmetry between outbred fish
   and isogenic hybrids, Fluctuating asymmetry of spotting pattern was
   investigated as a potential measure of developmental stability.
   Asymmetry of spotting pattern was not significantly different in
   homozygous fish compared to isogenic hybrids, However, spotting pattern
   showed a low coefficient of variation within lines and therefore may
   prove useful for identifying isogenic lines and monitoring genetic
   divergence within lines. The increased developmental stability and
   decreased variance of meristic traits in the isogenic hybrid rainbow
   trout indicates they were less influenced by environmental conditions
   and may make better research organisms than would the homozygous clones.}},

Abstract = {{Using satellite telemetry, we monitored the movements of an adult female
   polar bear (Ursus maritimus) as she traveled from the Alaskan Beaufort
   Sea coast to northern Greenland. She is the first polar bear known to
   depart the Beaufort Sea region for an extended period, and the first
   polar bear known to move between Alaska and Greenland. This bear
   traveled for four months across the polar basin and came within 2
   degrees of the North Pole. During the first year following her capture,
   she traveled 5256 km. Evidence to suggest her use of maternity dens in
   northern Alaska and in northern Greenland demonstrates the potential for
   genetic exchange between two widely separate populations of polar bears.
   The long life spans of polar bears and the rarity of their long-range
   movements means the significance of interpopulation movement can be
   assessed only after long-term monitoring of individuals.}},

   Benzene concentrations measured in the metropolitan area of Milan in an

   carbon monoxide (CO) measurements realized by the Milan air pollution
   network. Starting from these two series of values a typical ratio
   between CO and benzene has been calculated and it has been found to be

Abstract = {{Field experiments in which clip-caged apterae of Myzus persicae (Sulzer)
   (Homoptera: Aphididae) were monitored on sugarbeet revealed that leaf
   age, plant age and infection of the host with beet yellows closterovirus
   (BYV) had very large effects on aphid performance (development,
   reproduction and survival). On healthy plants performance was much
   better on young, expanding heart leaves than on older leaves.
   performance on senescent leaves was poor. When apterae were kept on
   young heart leaves all their lives (by moving clip-cages to younger
   leaves every 4 days) there was a strong negative relationship between
   aphid performance and plant age (measured as plant leaf number at
   birth). On plants inoculated with BYV apterae showed large improvements
   in performance. These occurred so rapidly that nymphs born at the time
   of virus inoculation could benefit as much as those born later. The
   sizes and between-leaf distributions of M. persicae populations which
   developed from standard numbers of colonists on whole plants in cages
   were consistent with the results of the clip-cage experiments. Alatae
   were less sensitive than apterae to differences in plant and leaf age.
   Implications of the results for BYV epidemiology and control are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of estimates of population size of ringed seals (Phoca hispida)
   and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from several areas indicated that
   estimates of one predicted the range of expected population size of the
   other in areas where ringed seals constitute the primary prey. In some
   areas, the closeness of this relationship indicates where estimates of
   either seals or bears may be inaccurate. The number of seals required to
   support a population of polar bears of predetermined size was estimated
   independently using both behavioral and energetic data. Behavioral
   estimates of the number of seals killed may overestimate energetic
   requirements and vice versa. Predation and energy matrices indicated
   that high levels of predation on seals are sustainable only if most
   animals killed are young-of-the-year, The field metabolic rate of the
   polar bear appears to be about twice the basal metabolic rate. Densities
   of seals vary in response to overall productivity of the ecosystem in
   different areas, and fluctuations in their numbers and reproductive
   rates between years can be used to monitor changes in productivity of
   the ecosystem. These changes also cause variation in productivity of
   bears, which indicates the sensitivity, at the population level, of the
   relationship between ringed seals and polar bears.}},

Abstract = {{I used source-sink population models to explore the consequences of
   habitat degradation for populations living on good and degraded habitats
   linked by movement. In particular, I modeled the conversion of land form
   good habitat quality supporting positive population growth to a degraded
   condition in which there was population decline. I found that with high
   rates of movement between good and bad quality areas populations require
   relatively large amounts of good habitat to remain stable. However, low
   movement rates resulted in greater sensitivity of population growth to
   habitat loss. Even small amounts of habitat degradation could result in
   rapid changes in overall population growth rates depending upon the
   rates of population increase and decline in the two habitat types. I
   also developed and simulated an age-structured model for grizzly bears
   (Ursus arctos horribilis) existing in good and degraded habitats and fit
   this model to data from the Yellowstone grizzly population. I used this
   model to Predict the ability to detect crucial amounts of habitat
   degradation from census data and found that when degradation is slow
   (e.g., 1\% conversion of good to poor habitat per year), more than a
   decade may pass between crucial amounts of degradation-beyond which
   populations begin long-term decline-and its detection, even if census
   data were unrealistically good. Thus these simple models indicate that,
   at least in some circumstances, habitat degradation can have rapid and
   severe impacts on population dynamics and traditional monitoring
   programs may not be adequate to detect the consequences of degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of breeding habitat in North America has been implicated
   in the decline of forest-nesting, Neotropical migrant birds. We used a
   comparative approach to examine the effects of fragmentation on three
   forest-nesting migrants: Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo
   (Vireo olivaceus), and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). We surveyed
   birds and monitored reproductive success on 28 study plots in fragmented
   and contiguous forests in true midwestern regions. Distribution of
   individuals between fragmented and contiguous forests appeared to vary
   among species and regions, but total nest failure was significantly
   higher in fragments than contiguous forests in both regions for all
   species (p = 0.053). We attributed greater nest failure to increased
   nest predation (p = 0.093) and increased brood parasitism by the
   Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater, p = 0.009). In addition to greater
   total nest failure partial nest failure due to cowbird parasitism led to
   a reduction in the number of host fledglings. Although the causes of
   nest mortality appeared to be species specific, total nest failure and
   partial nest failure acted in concert to reduce the number of offspring
   per adult for all three species on fragments. We used simple population
   growth models to assess the viability of the three species in fragmented
   and contiguous habitats in both regions. In general populations on
   fragments appeared to be population sinks and populations on continguous
   forests appeared to be population sources. Assuming constant mortality
   during winter, projected growth indicated that without immigration
   Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo populations should become extinct on
   fragments in both regions and Wood Thrush populations should be
   maintained or slightly decline on fragments. Populations of all three
   species should increase in contiguous habitats in both regions without
   emigration. We suggest that habitat fragmentation reduces local
   reproduction and may have ramifications for the entire population. A
   clear understanding of population demography depends on examination of
   demographic dynamics within and among sources and sinks. We emphasize
   that the long-term viability of these species depends on maintaining
   large tracts of forest throughout the breeding range until the spatial
   scale at which source and sink populations interact can be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Density-dependent reproductive rate may be the result of all individuals
   in a population suffering reduced fecundity when density increases (Lack
   1954), or it may be the result of a lower proportion of individuals
   living in favorable places at high density (Andrewartha and Birch 1954).
   We used a key-factor analysis to investigate whether reproductive rate
   in two red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) populations was density
   dependent. Four k values were determined, indicating offspring mortality
   caused by: adult females not entering oestrus (k(1)), oestrous females
   not giving birth (k(2)), lactating females failing to wean offspring
   (k(3)), and mortality in litters of successful females (k(4)). We also
   investigated the effect of food availability on the different k values
   and tested predictions of the two contrasting hypotheses (Lack vs.
   Andrewartha and Birch) by examining the mechanisms of density
   dependence.
   The reproductive performance of female squirrels was monitored over 18
   breeding seasons in a coniferous forest and over 16 breeding seasons in
   a deciduous forest. In the coniferous forest, annual variation in pine
   seed abundance only affected k(4), which was only weakly related to
   total mortality of offspring (K). In the deciduous woodland, however,
   the key factors k(2) and k(3), which were strongly related with total K,
   were inversely correlated with food abundance. In the coniferous forest,
   only k(2) was female density dependent, and breeding failure before
   parturition occurred primarily among floaters, which were more numerous
   at high density. In the deciduous forest, annual and seasonal variation
   in the number of floaters caused density dependence in fecundity (k(1)).
   Increased breeding failure of lactating females (k(3)) with high female
   density was positively correlated with the number of floaters and with
   the proportion of females occupying poor quality home ranges. We
   concluded that density-dependent reproduction in red squirrels can be
   caused by two mechanisms: a direct density effect of more floaters at
   high female density, and an effect of habitat heterogeneity, with more
   females occupying poor territories at high densities, resulting in low
   breeding success. That reduced fecundity or breeding failure at high
   densities occurred mainly in female squirrels not occupying good
   territories, and that annual and seasonal variation in litter size of

Abstract = {{Factors limiting seed germination and seedling establishment of the
   hemiepiphyte Ficus stupenda were investigated with two field experiments
   conducted in a Bornean rain forest canopy. In Experiment I, seeds of F.
   stupenda were planted in potential establishment sites averaging 31 m
   above the ground in each of 45 dipterocarp trees. Twenty seeds each were
   planted in a total of 336 sites. Germination, survivorship, and growth
   were monitored over 1 yr, and examined in relation to microsite and host
   tree characteristics. The presence of substrate with good moisture
   retention (soil, rotting wood, or moss) was the most important factor
   for germination. Such substrates were most frequently associated with
   knothole sites in the canopy, which had the highest level of
   establishment success. Seedling survival to 12 mo was low (1.3\% of
   planted seeds), especially considering that the best available sites in
   each tree were selected. Only 0.04\% of seedlings showed vigorous growth
   after 12 mo. A seed-harvesting ant in the genus Pheidole significantly
   reduced germination success, and herbivory and desiccation killed many
   seedlings at later stages. In Experiment 2, seedling growth in natural
   canopy sites was compared with growth of seedlings in artificial planter
   boxes raised into the canopy in order to assess the relative quality of
   canopy sites. Planters were superior to natural sites for seedling
   survivorship and supported much more rapid seedling growth with a
   positive response to light level. Higher growth rates in planters
   compared with natural sites showed that water stress appeared to be the
   critical factor limiting seedling growth in the canopy, even in this
   very wet climate. Sites in the canopy with the optimal combination of
   conditions for fig seedling establishment appear to be very scarce.
   Ficus population densities may be limited by both biotic and abiotic
   factors reducing early recruitment success.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure is described for conducting an aquatic hazard assessment of
   selenium, Hazard is characterized in terms of the potential for
   food-chain bioaccumulation and reproductive impairment in fish and
   aquatic birds, which are the most sensitive biological responses for
   estimating ecosystem-level impacts of selenium contamination. Five
   degrees of hazard are possible depending on the expected environmental
   concentrations of selenium, exposure of fish and aquatic birds to toxic
   concentrations, and resultant potential for reproductive impairment. The
   degree of hazard is given a numerical score: 5, high hazard; 4, moderate
   hazard; 3, low hazard; 2, minimal hazard; and 1, no identifiable hazard.
   A separate hazard score is given to each of five ecosystem components:
   water, sediments, benthic macroinvertebrates, fish eggs, and aquatic
   bird eggs. A final hazard characterization is determined by adding
   individual scores and comparing the total to the following evaluation
   criteria: 5, no hazard; 6-8, minimal hazard; 9-11, low hazard; 12-15,
   moderate hazard; 16-25, high hazard. An example is given to illustrate
   how the protocol is applied to selenium data from a typical contaminant
   monitoring program. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored prevalence of Neozygites fresenii (Nowakowski) Batko in
   populations of cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover, during a 3-yr
   period and used these data to develop sampling strategies for predicting
   aphid population decline caused by disease. Aphid populations began to
   decline when average fungal prevalence (percentage of fungus-killed
   aphids) reached approximate to 15\%. Populations declined to low levels
   5-16 d later. Declines were more rapid in fields with higher initial
   densities of aphids. Fungus-killed aphids were detectable up to 10 d
   before prevalences reached approximate to 15\%. Detection at this early
   stage required (theoretically) the examination of 70-150 leaves per held
   (95\% probability of detection). However, a sample size of only 4-5
   leaves was required for detection after prevalence reached 4\%, which
   would be expected to occur approximate to 4 d before initial decline of
   aphid populations. With microscopic examination of 100 aphids per leaf,
   detection of fungus-infected aphids (95\% probability) required between
   9 and 17 leaf samples 10 d before decline of aphid populations, but only
   1 sample was required 4 d before decline of aphid populations. During
   early stages of epizootics (prevalences <15\%), fungal prevalences were
   greater on leaves 6 nodes below terminals, compared with leaves at the
   1st or 2nd positions below terminals. During this time, fungal
   prevalences were correlated in subsamples collected 2 m apart, In
   samples collected 100 m apart during the very early stages of epizootics
   (prevalences <1\%), distributions of infected aphids were clumped in 1
   of 3 sample fields. These results underscore the importance of
   representative sampling of cotton fields if the goal is early prediction
   of epizootics.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of the boundary of the geographic distribution of gypsy moth,
   Lymantria dispar (L.), populations is important for monitoring and
   controlling the spread of this species in North America. In this study,
   gypsy moth population boundaries were estimated from male moths counts
   in pheromone-baited traps and from egg mass counts in a 5.18-million-ha
   area in northwestern Virginia and southeastern West Virginia. Population
   boundaries were estimated for 5 yr (1988-1992) and for different
   population density thresholds using the following 3 methods: (1) best
   classification (minimizing the number of grid cell misclassifications),
   (2) 1st occurrence method, and (3) logistic regression of log population
   counts versus distance perpendicular to population boundary. All 3
   methods generated similar boundaries for male moth counts, and
   boundaries obtained with the first 2 methods were most correlated. The
   regression method failed to estimate boundaries of egg mass populations
   because of their irregular spatial distribution. However, the 2 other
   methods were successful and yielded similar results. The average gypsy
   moth spread rate estimated using male counts was 10.7-11.9 km/yr. The
   minimum spread rate was 3.8-4.9 lan in 1991, and the maximum rate was
   19.4-22.6 lan in 1989.}},

Abstract = {{Results presented here are the 1st report of synthetic lepidopteran

   Small squash, Cucurbita pepo (L.), plots treated with 5 mg of a
   pheromone blend of 99:1 E,Z,-2,13-octadecadien-1-ol acetate and Z,Z,-3,
   13-octadecadien-1-ol acetate were significantly more infested by squash
   vine borer, Melittia cucurbitae (Harris), than control plots. In
   electroantennogram tests, antennae of both mated and virgin females
   responded significantly to squash vine borer pheromone blend and
   components. Infestations of squash vine borer are a result of female
   immigration from feral populations, so release of pheromones for mating
   disruption or monitoring in squash fields may not stop establishment of
   squash vine borer populations and may in fact attract females.}},

Abstract = {{During the summers of 1985-1987, the southeastern United States suffered
   a drought equaled in severity only five times since AD 372. We monitored
   the abundance and population structure of five species of aquatic snakes
   before, during, and after this record event in South Carolina. There was
   significant variation among species in response to drought conditions.
   Based on capture records before the drought, Nerodia fasciata and
   Seminatrix pygaea left the study site in relatively high numbers whereas
   Nerodia floridana left in relatively low numbers. We found significant
   variation in the timing of movements among species; N. fasciata left the
   site mainly in 1986 and 1988 whereas Seminatrix pygaea left the site
   mainly in 1987. We suggest that N. fasciata left the site in direct
   response to low water levels whereas S. pygaea left in response to the
   absence of suitable prey. Snakes exited the site using discrete,
   non-random corridors. Long-term changes in abundance and species
   composition were marked; the prey base was altered radically, overall
   abundance of snakes was lowered, and Nerodia floridana was not seen at
   the site for five years after the drought. Our results support earlier
   suggestions that long-term data on populations are needed to determine
   whether population declines result from natural or anthropogenic
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{External morphologies of Clastoptera achatina Germar and C. obtusa (Say)
   from various collections were compared. The findings were described and
   illustrated. The only species found inhabiting pecan trees in the
   southeastern United States was C. achatina. C. obtusa rarely, if ever,
   develops on pecan. Also, the biology and life history of C. achatina was
   studied and described. During years of small or moderate populations, an
   overwintering and 2 generations of adults occurred, along with a very
   small, questionable, 3rd generation. Adults laid approximate to 2 eggs
   per site, and oviposition sites were adjacent to buds and usually on the
   smallest-diameter, youngest, and most succulent shoot tissue. Time
   required for egg-to-egg generations was approximate to 49 d. Five
   nymphal instars occurred. Females averaged 0.7 mm longer than males.
   Large numbers of spittlebug nymphs on pecan caused dieback of shoots,
   reduced nut size, poor nut quality, and sometimes abortion of immature
   nuts. Each of several large populations of spittlebugs on pecans failed
   to produce a subsequent generation, leading to their disappearance from
   the orchard. Parasites of C. achatina were not observed, but a number of
   heteropteran predators were found, the most numerous species being
   Deraeocoris nebulosus (Uhler). Several sympatric dipterans were found
   inhabiting spittlemasses. A trap for monitoring the presence of adult C,
   achatina is described.}},

   infested with lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), and rice
   weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L), and subsequently aerated when
   temperatures cooled, was compared with untreated wheat infested and
   aerated at the same conditions. Temperatures were monitored from 7 July
   to 5 April inside the bins and populations of the introduced species and
   a natural infestation of red Hour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst),
   were assessed using probe tl aps and a grain trier. Average daily
   temperatures at 7 sample positions in untreated wheat were from 17.01
   +/- 0.53 to 21.46 +/- 0.52 degrees C, and were not significantly
   different from average temperatures at corresponding positions in
   treated wheat, which were from 16.00 +/- 0.63 to 18.98 +/- 0.60 degrees
   C. Initial chlorpyrifos-methyl residue on treated wheat was 5.75 +/-
   0.51 ppm, but after 6 wk residues declined by 67.2 - 52.7\%. Lesser
   grain borers collected from probe traps and trier samples were
   significantly more numerous in untreated wheat than in treated wheat on
   the Ist sample date (20 August); however, populations were larger in
   treated wheat on 2 later sample dates (12 November and 29 March). Few
   rice weevils or red flour beetles were collected from treated wheat.
   There was significantly more dockage (ground flour and insect frass) in
   untreated wheat than in treated wheat on 4 of 6 sample dates, while the
   percentage of insect-damaged kernels was significantly greater in
   untreated wheat than in treated wheat on all sample dates.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple approaches to control viral infections in fish are being
   employed on an experimental basis in many fish disease laboratories.
   They include techniques to monitor fish populations for viruses by
   tissue culture infectivity, tagged antibody reagents to detect viral
   proteins, and nucleic acid probes for in situ hybridization or
   polymerase chain reaction amplification. The specificity and resolution
   of these detection methods are being constantly improved to increase
   their ease-of-use and sensitivity. In addition, scientists are
   developing prophylactic treatments in the form of traditional vaccines
   and subunit, peptide and genetic vaccines using molecular biological
   techniques. The success of all these approaches is obviously dependent
   on an understanding not only of the molecular structure of the virus and
   its genome but on the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to disease in the
   host animal as well. It is at this level, where there is so little
   known, that the formulation of appropriate control strategies has been
   difficult. For example, molecular techniques have provided evidence that
   the survivors of infection with infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus
   are long-term carriers of the virus. This finding raises questions
   regarding the policy of releasing anadromous fish that have survived the
   disease. Viral vaccines have been shown to work in preventing
   virus-induced mortalities in rainbow trout fry in laboratory trials, but
   no determination has been made on whether Vaccination also prevents the
   formation of a virus-carrier state in the survivors. More importantly,
   is there a vaccine formulation that will prevent carrier formation? (C)

Abstract = {{Brown trout Salmo trutta is one of the most valuable species inhabiting
   river drainages in Galicia (northwestern Spain). The influence of man,
   through overfishing and pollution, is thought to have caused the decline
   of trout in Galician rivers. To balance the possible population decline,
   Galician rivers have been stocked extensively with a brown trout stock
   of German origin during the last 30 years. In this study, the incidence
   of stocking practices has been investigated by an LDH-5{*} genetic
   marker. A very low number of stocked individuals have been observed
   within river populations. despite the long period of repopulation. Only
   eight out of the 44 populations analysed showed a limited number of
   individuals of hatchery origin. Most stocked individuals detected were
   0+ age, and showed a poor condition factor (K<1). Environmental factors
   (muscular stamina and food habits) and genetic factors (different
   selective conditions in hatchery medium) are invoked to explain the low
   viability of hatchery fish observed in this study. (C) 1995 The

Abstract = {{Ethoprop and disodium tetrathiocarbonate (TTC) were evaluated as

   of Rotylenchulus reniformis on pineapple in Hawaii. Treatments were
   established in a field on the Del Monte Fresh Fruit (Hawaii) plantation
   in spring 1991. Preplant soil treatments consisted of fumigation with
   1,3-D at 226 kg a.i./ha and TTC at 135 kg or 270 kg a.i./ha. Postplant
   nematicides for the 1,3-D treated plots were fenamiphos (3.4 kg a.i./ha
   trimonthly) and ethoprop (3.4 or 6.7 kg a.i./ha monthly).
   Tetrathiocarbonate was applied postplant to the TTC-treated plots every
   2 months at 67 kg a.i./ha. Nematode population densities were monitored
   in all plots at 3-month intervals. Tetrathiocarbonate was not effective
   in reducing the preplant soil population densities of R. reniformis or
   limiting subsequent nematode damage to the plants. Ethoprop and
   fenamiphos reduced nematode damage, resulting in greater yield in the
   first and second crop harvests (P < 0.05). Ethoprop was an effective
   alternative to fenamiphos for control of R. reniformis in pineapple.}},

Abstract = {{Two dhole (Cuon alpinus) packs were monitored in Mudumalai Sanctuary,
   southern India, during 1989-93 to look at population dynamics, movement
   pattern, and foraging strategy and their inter-relationship with the
   maintenance of social groups. Pack size fluctuated substantially (4-18
   and 4-25 in the two packs) owing to dispersal and demographic factors
   such as females not breeding in a given year. Both packs killed a much
   higher proportion of chital (Axis axis) and sambar (Cervus unicolor)
   fawns (< one year old) than their availability in the population. There
   was no correlation between pack size and body weight of prey killed,
   while per capita consumption of meat declined with increasing pack size.
   Home-range area (83.3 km(2) and 54.2 km(2) for the two packs) was not
   correlated with pack size. Pack movement from one resource patch
   (consisting of resting sites and aggregations of prey species) to
   another was not random or based on factors such as inter-patch distance
   or relative prey densities. There was no difference in mean residence
   time of the pack across the four resource patches; the pack moved across
   these in a sequential manner in one direction. We conclude that dholes
   live in groups not because of any advantages accruing from enhanced
   group sizes through increased per capita yield of food, but as a
   consequence of the dispersion of resources.}},

Abstract = {{Samples from populations of a common Red Sea coral reef sponge, Mycale
   fistulifera, contained 1.7 to 25\% sponges associated with polyps of
   Nausithoe cf. punctata Kolliker,1853 (Scyphozoa: order Coronata). In the
   northern Red Sea this colonial scyphozoan was found exclusively in
   symbiosis with sponges. The proportion of the symbiotic sponges within
   the population differed significantly between seasons. Polyps were found
   significantly more frequently on large (>30 cm(2)) sponges than on small
   (< 30 cm(2)) ones. The polydisc polyps of N. cf. punctata released
   ephyrae for 1 to 4 mo during the summer, several days before full moon,
   mainly during the afternoon and early evening. A colony discharged up to
   1340 ephyrae d(-1), with variations between colonies and years. During
   the 13.5 mo of monitoring, symbiotic sponges survived better than
   aposymbiotic ones (43 versus 3\%). Few ephyrae survived in the
   laboratory until maturity (12\% for 30 d). During in situ experiments
   the starfish Choriaster granulatus avoided symbiotic sponges but fed on
   aposymbiotic ones. The echinoid Tripneustes gratilla showed a similar
   trend (although statistically P > 0.05), while Diadema setosum fed
   equally or less (P > 0.05) on symbiotic compared with nonsymbiotic
   sponges. Echinotrix calamaris fed on both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic
   sponges. This mutual symbiosis seems to be facultative for the sponge
   and obligatory for the scyphozoan. Some of the demonstrated benefits of
   this symbiosis are: the sponge enhanced survival, size and relative
   protection; and the absence of free-living scyphozoans indicates the
   necessity of the association for the survival of N. cf. punctata.}},

Abstract = {{We review the application of spatially explicit models to conservation
   biology, and discuss several problems regarding the use of these models.
   First, it is unclear whether increasing the complexity of spatial models
   to include age structure enhances our ability to predict population
   growth in temporally varying environments. Second, if simulations of
   individual behavior are used to identify options for landscape
   management, predictions about the fate of dispersing organisms are
   likely to be hugely in error unless dispersal attributes are known to a
   far greater degree of accuracy than is reasonable to expect. Third, the
   compelling metaphor of extinction debts resulting from habitat
   destruction in competitive communities stands firm as a cautionary tale
   even when the metapopulation models include multiple trophic levels -
   but the question remains of how widespread and tight are the tradeoffs
   between dispersal capacity and competitive superiority. Given the
   shakiness of spatial models as a foundation for specific conservation
   recommendations, we conclude they may be more useful as a tool for
   exploring the design of spatially-structured monitoring schemes, so that
   management mistakes might be detected before they become irreversible.}},

Abstract = {{Sesamia nonagrioides Lefebvre diapauses as mature larvae. Once diapause
   is induced, larvae continue to grow and moult with no apparent changes,
   so distinction between non-diapausing and diapausing larvae is
   difficult. In the present work two physiological markers of diapause
   induction are obtained and their efficacy in detecting diapause onset
   and in monitoring diapause development in field populations is
   evaluated. The first marker is based on the differential capacity of two
   photoregimes, LD 0:24 h and LD 16:8 h, to reverse diapause induction.
   When larvae of the first and second stadia were subjected to the
   diapause-inducing LD 12:12 h light cycle and then transferred to LD 0:24
   h, larvae pupated after a development duration significantly higher than
   that of the larvae transferred to LD 16:8 h. This criterion was used to
   monitor diapause development in overwintering larvae until
   field-collected larvae submitted to LD 0:24 h pupated synchronously with
   those submitted to LD 16:8 h. This occurred between late January and
   early March. The second marker refers to development of imaginal wing
   discs. A relative index of the tracheal mass area divided by the total
   disc area diminishes steadily during development in non-diapausing
   sixth-instar larvae until it becomes zero just before pupation, whereas
   it remains constant in diapausing larvae. Though wing disc development
   was blocked in diapausing sixth-instar larvae, the disc continued to
   grow and, consequently, the total area of the disc was not a suitable
   marker of diapause induction. When the constancy of the relative area
   index was used to monitor diapause development and termination in
   overwintering larvae, the results agreed with those obtained using the
   first criterion and with previous field observations.}},

Abstract = {{Foliar and root growth of potato (cv. Russet Burbank) and colonization
   of roots and stem vascular sap by Verticillium dahliae were monitored
   weekly for 4 weeks beginning at emergence in soils maintained at
   different water pressures. A significant soil water pressure x V.
   dahliae interaction resulted in reduced aerial biomass and increased
   root-to-shoot ratio under excessive soil moisture conditions (-0.01
   MPa). At -0.01 MPa, the percent increase in root-to-shoot ratio of
   plants grown in infested compared with noninfested soil ranged from 40
   to 82\% over 2 years. In contrast, both root length and colonization of
   roots by V. dahliae were significantly suppressed at -0.01 MPa compared
   with the low est soil water pressure (-0.15 MPa). Roots of plants grown
   at -0.01 compared with -0.15 MPa were 19.6 to 44\% shorter at emergence,
   and suppression of root growth at this high soil water pressure
   persisted through the observation period. Root colonization by V.
   dahliae was suppressed consistently at -0.01 compared with -0.15 MPa.
   Reduction in CFU per 100 cm of root length for these respective soil
   water pressures ranged from 60 to 100\%. Soil water pressure had no
   effect on the population size of V. dahliae in stem sap. High soil water
   pressures may enhance potato early dying caused by V. dahliae by slowing
   root growth and/or by indirectly increasing the rate of microsclerotial
   germination. Both would facilitate entry of the pathogen into the stele
   through the vulnerable tissue of the root apex.}},

Abstract = {{Many aspects of plant development are associated with changing
   concentrations of the phytohormone auxin, Several stages of root
   formation exhibit extreme sensitivities to exogenous auxin and are
   correlated with shifts in endogenous auxin concentration, In an effort
   to elucidate mechanisms regulating development of adventitious roots, an
   ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized Mp population of Arabidopsis was
   screened for mutants altered in this process. A recessive nuclear
   mutant, rooty (rty), displayed extreme proliferation of roots,
   inhibition of shoot growth, and other alterations suggesting elevated
   responses to auxin or ethylene, Wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings grown on
   auxin-containing media phenocopied rty, whereas rty seedlings were
   partially rescued on cytokinin-containing media. Analysis by gas
   chromatography-selected ion monitoring-mass spectrometry showed
   endogenous indole-3-acetic acid concentrations to be two to 17 times
   higher in rty than in the wild type. Dose-response assays with exogenous
   indole-3-acetic acid indicated equal sensitivities to auxin in tissues
   of the wild type and rty. Combining rty with mutations conferring
   resistance to auxin (axr1-3) or ethylene (etr1-1) suggested that root
   proliferation and restricted shoot growth are auxin effects, whereas
   other phenotypic alterations are due to ethylene. Four mutant alleles
   from independently mutagenized populations were identified, and the
   locus was mapped using morphological and restriction fragment length
   polymorphism markers to 3.9 centimorgans distal to marker m605 on
   chromosome 2. The wild-type RTY gene product may serve a critical role
   in regulating auxin concentrations and thereby facilitating normal plant
   growth and development.}},

Abstract = {{Population dynamics of epiphytic fungi associated with the summer bunch
   rot complex of five wine grape (Vitis vinifera) varieties in commercial
   vineyards in the San Joaquin Valley of California were monitored every
   two weeks by berry washings during 1989-1992. Vines in the five
   replicated experiments were subjected to basal leaf removal or left
   unaltered, Although numerous genera of fungi were isolated, species of
   Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Alternaria predominated.
   Population densities of most fungal taxa increased at or after veraison.
   Leaf removal in the fruiting zones of bilateral cordon-trained vines
   generally reduced (P < 0 . 05) mid to late season numbers of epiphytic
   mycoflora; species of Penicillium, Botrytis and Aspergillus were most
   commonly reduced. Populations of Alternaria spp. and yeasts were not
   consistently affected by leaf removal. Numbers of fungi were no lower on
   berries when leaves were removed from both sides of vines than when
   leaves were removed only from the shaded side, Incidence and severity of
   bunch rots (sour rot, rots caused by Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus
   niger, and total rot) at harvest were consistently reduced where leaves
   had been removed in comparison to vines where no leaves were removed. In
   one experiment, berries from vines sprayed with the grower's choice of
   pesticides at 50\% or 100\% of label rates had similar numbers of
   epiphytic mycoflora in both cases frequently lower than those from
   unsprayed controls, There was a significant interaction between chemical
   rate and leaf removal on the incidence of sour rot at harvest, Timing
   and extent of leaf removal did not affect population dynamics of
   epiphytic fungi, or incidence or severity of bunch rots (P < 0 . 05) at
   harvest in other trials.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal patterns of social organization and habitat use were studied in
   the kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros population of the central Kruger
   National Park. The population was monitored continuously over three
   years with radio telemetry and regular road counts. Habitat use by kudu
   cows and bulls differed significantly during wet and dry seasons. Bulls
   maintained a strong preference for riverine/watercourse habitat
   throughout the year. Cows were distributed across savanna habitat and an
   ecotone between hills and savanna in the wet season. In the dry season
   they increased their use of riverine/watercourse habitat, which is a dry
   season forage reserve for the browsing guild. The greatest potential for
   intersexual competition would thus be expected in the dry season, but in
   fact this was when kudu bulls and cows were least segregated. Therefore
   sexual segregation in kudu cannot be explained by intersexual
   competition. Alternative hypotheses entail (i) sex differences in
   nutritional needs and (ii) predation avoidance behaviour that differs
   between cow groups and bull groups.}},

Abstract = {{Based on combined information available from air quality monitoring data

   NO2 and O-3 has been estimated. This information has been combined with
   the results of epidemiological studies assessing strength of association

   pollution on health in Europe. The analysis indicates that a
   considerable number of health problems, ranging from mild irritation of
   the respiratory system to increased mortality, can be attributed to
   short-term peaks of pollution observed in Europe. Chronic impacts of
   prolonged elevated SO2 levels on lung function are estimated to occur in

Abstract = {{The `'Shenandoah National Park: Fish in Sensitive Habitats'' (SNP:FISH)
   project is a response to declining pH and acid neutralizing capacity in
   Shenandoah National Park (SNP) streams. SNP receives more atmospheric
   sulfate than any other USA national park, and pH had decreased to the
   point where early negative effects on fish were expected. SNP provides
   the opportunity to study the early stages of acidification effects on
   fish. Three different classes of geological formations yield streams
   with low-ANC (0 mu Eq/L), intermediate-ANC (60-100 mu Eq/L) or high-ANC
   (150-200 mu Pq/L) waters in SNP. This allows a comparison of responses
   across a water quality gradient in a small geographic area receiving
   similar deposition. Both chronic and episodic acidification occur in SNP
   streams. Biological effects are apparent in fish species richness,
   population density, condition factor, age, size, and bioassay survival.
   A primary project objective was to provide the necessary data for
   development and testing models for forecasting changes in fish
   communities resulting from changes in stream chemistry. Monitored
   variables include several which are predictive of acidification effects
   on SNP fish communities.}},

Abstract = {{Acid-induced fish damage in small lakes in southern Finland was studied
   in a fish status survey of eighty lakes from 1985-1987. Later, twenty of
   these lakes were selected for further monitoring. A sampling of these
   lakes from 1988-1989 showed that the decrease in some perch (Perca
   fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) populations still
   continued. The results from the same lakes in 1992 showed that
   successful reproduction had taken place with many of the perch
   populations that had been close to extinction in 1985. in contrast, no
   signs of recovery in the roach populations were detected The explanation
   for the appearance of new cohorts of perch could have been the decrease
   in acid deposition but the exceptional hydrological conditions of
   winters in the early 1990s may also have affected them The different
   responses of the perch and roach populations were interpreted as a
   consequence of the different sensitivity of these two species to
   acidification. Even a slight improvement in the water quality has
   resulted in the appearance of strong new year-classes of perch, but not
   of roach. Therefore, more improvement in water quality is needed until a
   sensitive species like roach can reproduce again.}},

Abstract = {{The awareness of the effects of transboundary pollution has increased
   the necessity to use comparable methods and to initiate joint studies
   between countries in environmental monitoring. In freshwater fish
   monitoring a number of different methods have been used, strongly
   reducing the possibilities to comparative assessments between countries.
   In 1990, a workshop on freshwater fish sampling was initiated in order
   to develop and intercalibrate methods used in freshwater fish studies in
   the Nordic countries. During a three year period, a new type of
   multi-mesh gill net to be used for fish monitoring in Norway, Finland
   and Sweden have been developed. Comparative studies and
   gillnet-selectivity assessments show that these new multi-mesh gillnets
   better describe the actual population structure of European perch (Perca
   fluviatilis), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and Arctic char (Salvelinus
   alpinus) than do the traditional giunet series used in the Nordic
   countries. Ageing of fish is central in most environmental studies,
   however, the comparability of analyses performed at different
   laboratories may be low. Comparative age analyses between the three
   countries have been performed for a number of fish species. The results
   of ageing E. perch, whitefish (Coregonus sp.) and roach indicate that
   differences between laboratories can be reduced by intercalibration. In
   the future, the workgroup will be focused on a further development of
   joint methods within studies of freshwater fish and on joint internordic
   assessments on species distribution, abundance and life history
   characteristics in relation to airborne pollutants and liming.}},

Abstract = {{Sulphur emissions from Russian Kola Peninsula smelters are known to
   cause surface water acidification in the border areas between Norway and
   Russia. The sulphur deposition is also high in the eastern part of
   Finnish Lapland. In 1990, a monitoring programme was started to survey
   the effects of acid deposition on sensitive fish populations in
   north-eastern Finnish Lapland. Altogether 103 sites in three areas were
   electrofished and autumn water samples were taken. Besides the brown
   trout (Salmo trutta), special attention was paid to the occurrence of
   minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) since it is a common species in small waters
   and is highly sensitive to acidification. During the first three years
   of monitoring no signs of acidification were recorded. The alkalinity
   values of brooks generally exceeded 0.1 mmol/l. Brown trout, minnow and
   burbot (Lota lota) were caught frequently in the study sites. Later the
   study was focused on the uninhabited Vatari area which is receiving the
   highest sulphur deposition in Finnish Lapland. The alkalinity values of
   the sampled brooks were in most cases below 0.05 mmol/l, indicating a
   decreased buffer capacity. However, the electrofishing of the brooks
   showed no acid-induced damage. The lowest alkalinity values were
   detected from a group of small upland ponds. In four such ponds the
   alkalinity was zero or negative. No minnows were caught from these four
   ponds apart from one, where the minnows were exceptionally large. The
   results show that the waters near the eastern border of northern Finnish
   Lapland are threatened by acidification. No damage to fish populations
   subject to fishing was observed. The absence of minnows in some small
   waters is possibly the first sign of acid-induced fish population
   damage.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of benthic animal communities in three limed Norwegian rivers
   showed differed progress in the recovery response of sensitive animals.
   In River Vikedal highly sensitive species established populations in the
   limed part of the river after a few months. The response was slower in
   River Audna. Longer distances to parental populations was probably the
   main reason for this. The benthic community of the main River Ogna was
   unstable, while continuous liming of a highly acidified tributary did
   not result in improvement of the fauna. In River Vikedal, the bivoltine
   mayfly Baetis rhodani was more numerous in the autumn samples indicating
   critical water quality during spring. An adjustment of the pH of the
   limed water resulted in an increase of this species. The relative
   abundance of sensitive animals increased downstreams from the point of
   liming. This may partly be explained by clogging of powdered limestone
   in the areas closest to the lime doser. A better and more stable water
   chemistry in the downstream reaches is probably also important.
   Contrary, the suspended lime did not influence the abundance of
   filter-feeders.}},

Abstract = {{The acidified Lake Hovvatn have been limed in 1981, 1987, 1989 and 1991.
   After the first liming the lake reacidified close to the prelimed
   condition. The reliming, which started in 1987, was planned to maintain
   the pH at a relatively high level for the lake. A detailed monitoring of
   pH and temperature was performed at depth 0.5, 1, 1,5 and 5 m since
   spring 1983. Quantitative samples of benthic invertebrates were taken in
   spring and fall in 1977 and regularly at the same seasons from 1981 at
   depth 0.5, 2, 5 and 10 m. A reference lake, Lille Hovvatn have been
   sampled with the same procedure since 1988. The acid tolerant mayfly
   Leptophlebia vespertina responded quickly to the first liming with a 20
   times increase in density after a few months. However,the densities
   rapidly decreased during the first years of reacidification. The lime
   treatments in 1987 and 1989, resulted in a second peak in density in
   1990. After this, the densities have been reduced in spite of generally
   good water quality in Hovvatn. During fall the density increase was
   significant at 0.5 m depth in 1990, at 2 m depth in 1989, 1990 and 1992
   and at 5 m depth in 1988 to 1990. No significant increase was observed
   in the limed localities during spring. It is concluded that acid surface
   water, prior to ice break, affect the food resources to L. vespertina
   and reduce the population at all depths during spring and in the
   littoral zone in fall.}},

Abstract = {{Research during the mid 1980s identified acidified forested catchments
   in central Scotland whose hydrochemistry was not capable of supporting
   native fish populations. Calcium concentrations were around 20 mu eq
   1(-1), less than the suggested critical value of 50 mu eq 1(-1), with
   hydrogen concentrations around 70 mu eq 1(-1), greater than the critical
   value of about 30 mu eq 1(-1). Limestone was applied by aerial
   application to the source areas of selected streams in 1990 with around
   5\% (15 ha) of the total catchment area of 270 ha treated at 10 tonnes
   ha(-1). Stream monitoring, carried out over the period 1989-1995, showed
   an immediate response to liming followed by a progressive decline.
   Calcium values were elevated to > 150 mu eq 1(-1) and hydrogen
   concentrations reduced to 20 mu eq 1(-1), reverting in time towards
   pre-liming values. Although salmonid survival was improved during low
   flow conditions in summer, only a few fry survived to the autumn as acid
   episodes increased and these were subsequently lost from the system
   during the winter period Budget calculations indicated losses of around
   30\% of the applied calcium during the first four years. Studies on the
   vegetation and soils revealed a greater than expected penetration of
   calcium to depth (10-20 cm) in the soil profile. Results suggest that
   source area liming at this rate has had minimal effects on the
   vegetation and by increasing the proportion of the catchment limed to
   15\% could have a much greater success in reducing the frequency of
   biologically damaging episodes.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Orvattnet has been monitored extensively for both chemical and
   biological variables since 1967. The lake acidified during the 1960's
   and pH was mostly below 5 throughout the 1970's. Due to the
   acidification, peat moss (Sphagnum spp.) expanded over the lake bottom
   and the only surviving fish species was perch (Perca fluviatilis), but
   it experienced reproduction problems. In the mid 1980's, the Sphagnum
   cover collapsed, and by 1989 it had almost disappeared. There has been a
   clear recovery of the perch population. Recovery of the lake is also
   recorded by diatom assemblages in the lake sediment. Diatom-inferred pH
   increased from 4.7 to 4.9. The development of measured lake-water pH is
   unclear, but acid episodes in spring have become less severe. By 1993,
   atmospheric sulphate deposition had decreased by 30-40\% in this area of
   Sweden compared to the late 1960's. Lake-water sulphate concentrations
   have decreased by similar to 30\% since the 1960's. Nitrogen deposition
   has increased over the last decades, but is not yet contributing to lake
   acidification. No major land-use changes have occurred and changes in
   hydrology cannot explain the observed changes in chemistry and biology.
   We ascribe the recent recovery in the lake to reduced deposition of
   sulphate. In conclusion, Lake Orvattnet has begun to recover from
   acidification.}},

Abstract = {{Seed populations of Avena sterilis ssp. ludoviciana (Durieu) Nyman were
   monitored in a naturally occurring infestation throughout its life
   cycle. Considering the large weed population present (298 panicles
   m(-2)), total seed production was relatively low: 3838 seeds m(-2). Only
   68\% of these seeds were recovered from the soil surface and a further
   3\% were removed with wheat grain and straw during harvest operations.
   The numbers of seeds from the stubble between mid-July and mid-September
   were relatively low (10\%). Ploughing the stubble in October buried most
   of the recently produced seed rain and resulted in a relatively uniform
   vertical distribution of the seedbank. Maximum seed persistence in the
   soil ranged from 27 to 43 months (depending on the experimental
   technique used to do the study). Seed decline followed an exponential
   pattern on a yearly basis, with the greatest decline taking place
   between October and April (57-90\% in year 1 and 10-40\% in year 2).
   Between May and September the buried seed populations remained
   practically constant. Seedbank depletion was primarily due to seedling
   production (25\%) and `lethal' germination (24\%). Although the depth of
   burial had very little effect on seed survival, the mode of seed
   disappearance was closely related to their depth in the soil. Seed
   depletion through `lethal' germination increased with increasing depth
   in the soil, whereas depletion through seedling emergence decreased with
   increasing depth.}},

Abstract = {{Traps baited with synthetic aggregation pheromones of Carpophilus
   hemipterus (L.), C. mutilatus Erichson and C. davidsoni Dobson and
   fermenting bread dough were used to identify the fauna and monitor
   seasonal abundance of nitidulids in orchards in four stone fruit growing
   regions of southeastern Australia (Shepparton, Cobram (Victoria),
   Renmark (South Australia), Windsor (New South Wales)). During 1992-94,
   seven species (C. davidsoni, C. hemipterus, C. mutilatus, C. (Urophorus)
   humeralis (F.), C. gaveni Dobson, C. marginellus Motschulsky and an
   unidentified species `'Y'') were trapped at all sites and an additional
   unidentified species (''X'') was recorded from Windsor. C. davidsoni was
   the dominant species at all sites, particularly at Shepparton where it
   accounted for 88-98\% of all nitidulids trapped. C. hemipterus was
   trapped commonly at Cobram and Renmark but was rare at Windsor and
   Shepparton. C. mutilatus was common at Windsor and Renmark but rare in
   Shepparton and Cobram. The total number of nitidulids trapped at
   Shepparton was 10-15 times greater than at the other sites in 1993-94.
   Seasonal abundance of Carpophilus spp. was similar at all sites with
   high numbers in spring, followed by a decline and a secondary peak in
   early summer. At the three inland sites (Shepparton, Cobram, Renmark),
   populations `'crashed'' and beetles were virtually absent during
   January-March. A less dramatic decline also occurred at Windsor.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the validity of dogs and cats as sentinels of
   environmental lead exposure to humans. This paper reports findings from
   a study conducted in Granite City, IL, during the summer of 1991. At
   this site, a former secondary lead smelter had been in activity for more
   than 80 years. The smelter was shut down in 1982. The surrounding area
   was found to be contaminated with lead, with soil lead concentrations
   above 5000 ppm in some places. The Illinois Department of Public Health
   conducted a survey in the community to determine the effects of lead on
   the local population. We sampled dogs and cats owned by these people.
   Our results suggest that living near a closed lead smelter, with heavy
   soil contamination, was not associated with high blood lead
   concentrations in pets, or their owners. There was a significant
   relationship between BLC (blood lead concentrations), in indoor pets and
   younger children, which was consistent with our hypothesis that pets
   could be used to monitor childhood lead exposure. We also found that,
   when there was one pet with a high BLC in a house, the likelihood of
   finding one person with a BLC above 10 mu g/dl was significantly
   increased.}},

Abstract = {{Recently it was suggested chat the handling of wild dogs (Lycaon pictus)
   by researchers in the Serengeti ecosystem created stress, resulting in
   the reactivation of latent rabies viruses in carrier animals. We present
   data from ongoing studies on free-ranging and captive wild dogs
   elsewhere in Africa which do not support this hypothesis. Cortisol
   profiles suggest that immobilization of wild dogs does not cause the
   chronic stress required for stress-reactivation of latent viruses.
   Furthermore, there is no evidence of handling-related mortalities in
   wild dogs: the survivorship of unhandled and handled free-ranging wild
   dogs did not differ and no captive animals died within a year of
   handling (immobilization and/or vaccination against rabies). We suggest
   that the mortalities observed in Tanzania were due to an outbreak of a
   disease which rabies vaccination was unable to prevent. Intensive
   monitoring and active management research programmes on wild dogs are
   essential as without these, critically endangered wild dog populations
   have little hope of survival.}},

Abstract = {{Seathwaite Tarn, in the English Lake District, was used as an
   experimental site to test the feasibility of increasing the pH of an
   acidified waterbody by adding a phosphorus-based fertiliser solution.
   The impact of this experiment on the planktonic rotifer community was
   assessed by monitoring for two years before treatment (1990-1991), and
   for a further two years once treatment had begun (1992-1993). The pH of
   the water rose by 0.5 pH units over the period of fertilisation, and the
   lake became very eutrophic. This had little effect on the species
   composition of the rotifer assemblage, which continued to reflect the
   acid, oligotrophic nature of the untreated lake. However, there were
   marked changes in the levels of abundance of most planktonic species.
   Population densities of Keratella serrulata and Trichocerca longiseta
   increased in early spring, compared to pre-treatment levels, apparently
   due to the rises in chlorophyll-a concentrations. In contrast,
   Polyarthra dolichoptera became very scarce after fertilisation began.
   The treatment seemed to have little effect on the population dynamics of
   the dominant openwater rotifer, Polyarthra remata. In 1993, very high
   densities of Bosmina coregoni (up to 250 x 10(3) ind m(-3)) developed in
   response to the eutrophication programme. This seemed to suppress the
   rotifer community in the summer months.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis were monitored in three
   small ponds in a marsh on the Mediterranean coast. Samples were taken
   approximately every three weeks from July 1992 to November 1993.
   Salinity, temperature, conductivity, pH and oxygen concentration were
   measured in the field. Population density was determined from preserved
   quantitative samples. Individuals were classified as mictic females,
   amictic females, non-ovigerous females, and males, differentiating
   between two morphotypes ('S' and `L'). From these counts, a level of
   mixis was calculated. We also determined the proportion of mictic
   females in natural populations by culturing females isolated from fresh
   samples. From these data, mictic patterns over time and correlation
   between levels of mixis and environmental and population parameters were
   analyzed. From a previous study `S' and `L' morphotypes were known to
   correspond to genetically different clonal groups. Our data showed that
   reproduction was predominantly parthenogenetic in these clonal groups,
   but mictic females were found in most samples, the proportion of mictic
   females ranging from 0 to 29\%. The clonal groups showed different
   patterns of mixis. L clonal group presented a continuous sexual
   reproductive pattern. In contrast, S clones showed a rather punctuated
   mictic pattern. A positive correlation between levels of sexual
   reproduction and population density was found for S and L groups.
   However, they differed in their density threshold for mictic
   reproduction. The adaptive meaning of these patterns and their
   implications in maintaining genetic diversity within and between
   populations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of bats emerge from maternity colonies in a non-random
   manner; however, quantifying the extent to which the emergence differs
   from random is complicated by the underlying variation in intensity of
   the emergence. In this paper an empirical method which overcomes these
   analytical difficulties is used to examine the functional nature of the
   pattern of bat emergence. The emergence behaviour from two large
   colonies of pipistrelle bats containing between 102 and 976 individual
   bats was monitored during the summers of 1992 and 1993. Both colonies
   had two primary exit holes with bats from one hole crossing the face of
   the second hole. Emergence events at the first hole triggered events at
   the second hole at both colonies demonstrating that the clumped
   emergence pattern was not a bottleneck artefact. The extent of clumping
   was greatest during the first half of the emergence, when light levels
   were high, suggesting an anti-predation function. This pattern was not a
   consequence of a higher emergence intensity early in the evening. (C)

Abstract = {{The functional response of Orius insidiosus (Say) to one of its primary
   prey, the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande),
   was measured on bean, tomato, and pepper plants in the greenhouse. Fewer
   thrips were taken by the predator on tomato than on bean plants, and a
   lower attack coefficient was calculated on tomato than on bean and
   pepper plants. Differences in the searching behavior of the predator on
   the 3 plants affected the shape of the functional response of O.
   insidiosus to its prey. To assess the relationship between populations
   of O. insidiosus and its prey (thrips, aphids, leafhoppers, and
   whiteflies), bean, tomato, pepper, and corn plots were monitored at 2
   field sites. At both sites, O. insidiosus density was significantly
   higher on bean and corn than on pepper (densities in tomato were
   intermediate). Although the phenology of the predator differed among
   crops, its population dynamics generally followed that of its prey. A
   direct (behavioral) density-dependent response was found to prey in
   pepper and tomato, whereas a delayed (reproductive) response was
   detected in bean and corn. Further, the ratio between the densities of
   O. insidiosus nymphs and adults (an indication of population growth) was
   higher in bean and corn than in tomato and pepper. The importance of
   plant characteristics to predator-prey interactions is discussed, and
   particular attention is given to the influence of the plant-feeding
   habits of O. insidiosus.}},

   Hybridization with cloned or PCR-amplified fragments determined the map

   detected a high level of length variation including heteroplasmy near or

Abstract = {{Traps consisting of open, cylindrical tins containing moistened clay
   aggregates were evaluated as field oviposition sites for corn rootworm,
   Diabrotica spp. Six trap features were investigated: clay aggregate
   size, water saturation level, trap opening, trap cover, trap volume, and
   trap position relative to corn plants. More eggs were recovered in traps
   containing clay aggregates ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 mm diameter compared
   with aggregates from 2.5 to 8.0 mm diameter. Saturation of the trap to
   2.5 cm from the opening resulted in greater egg recovery compared with
   traps saturated to 6.0 cm from the opening. Covering the exposed surface
   of the trap with a metal ring and/or a corn leaf increased egg recovery
   in the field.
   Oviposition traps were placed in four commercial corn fields in 1990 and
   three in 1991 to monitor egg populations. Egg recovery from traps and
   estimates of the absolute egg population in the soil were compared with
   densities of adult corn rootworm to predict larval damage on roots of
   corn planted the next year. Ln five fields, adult populations were above
   the current economic threshold of one beetle per plant. However,
   economic damage to roots occurred only in the field in which the most
   eggs were recovered from traps (226.6 eggs per trap) and soil samples
   (30.2 eggs per litre). Mean egg recovery per trap per field was
   correlated with mean damage ratings from untreated corn.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the spatial dynamics of fox squirrels (Sciurus niger)
   occupying 12 woodland sites in a predominantly agricultural landscape of
   west-central Indiana. The 12 sites represented woodlands of varying
   degrees of isolation and size. Forty-nine adult fox squirrels were
   fitted with radio collars and monitored from May 1993 through September
   1994. No movements of collared adults were observed between wooded sites
   during the study, although squirrels traveled 200-500 m from woodlots
   along hedgerows, and 2.6\% of observations occurred in agricultural
   fields. Multiple regression revealed a positive linear relationship
   between home-range size and woodland size, with larger home ranges in
   the growing season. Home-range size was not related to woodland
   isolation, squirrel density, or sex. We found no evidence of spatial
   interactions between pairs of squirrels (i.e., male-male, male-female,
   female-female) at resolutions of 20, 40, or 100 m. Excursions beyond a
   core area were of relatively greater magnitude for squirrels occupying
   continuous forest. Agriculturally induced fragmentation of forests
   appears to restrict movements of adult fox squirrels, despite the
   well-documented ability of the species to persist in such a landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Bird populations in a subtropical wet forest were monitored every two to
   three weeks with mist nets and paint counts beginning two weeks after
   the passage of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The results were
   compared with those of a pre-hurricane study in the same locations in
   which birds were sampled in forest understory and openings. Capture
   rates were initially higher than in the previous study, due to displaced
   canopy dwellers foraging in the understory. The shift of canopy dwellers
   may have obscured expected declines in nectarivores and fruit/seedeaters
   and contributed to increased detections of omnivores and insectivores.
   Bird captures and fruit production peaked 93-156 days after the storm in
   pre-existing gaps, where higher capture rates and a distinct assemblage
   of birds occurred in contrast to sites without fruit (forest understory
   and a powerline opening). Captures in preexisting gaps decreased as
   fruit production ceased, and overall captures declined to baseline
   levels after 198 days. After one year of recovery, new gaps and forest
   understory became distinguishable on the basis of their unique foliage
   profiles. Although different bird assemblages had been found in forest
   understory and in gaps prior to the hurricane, these assemblages lost
   their distinctiveness after the storm. It may take many years after a
   hurricane for forest understory and gaps to become sufficiently distinct
   in structure and resources before birds differentiate between the two
   habitats.}},

   DECLINE OF AN EXOTIC PLANT}},

Abstract = {{The Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) population in
   Brownington Pond, Vermont, declined between 1986 and 1989. Watermilfoil
   covered approximate to 10-11 ha of the littoral zone in 1986. Less than
   0.5 ha remained in 1989. An herbivorous weevil (Euhrychiopsis lecontei),
   which is native to North America, was found associated with this
   watermilfoil population and we hypothesized that this weevil played a
   role in the decline. We monitored watermilfoil and E. lecontei
   populations in Brownington Pond from 1990 through 1992 by (1) mapping
   the location and extent of beds in the pond, and (2) determining
   watermilfoil biomass along permanent transects. The abundance of weevil
   eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults were monitored by sampling individual
   watermilfoil stems.
   Watermilfoil cover increased to approximate to 2.5 ha by 1991 and then
   declined again to approximate to 1 ha by 1992. The reduction in
   watermilfoil biomass from 1991 to 1992 ranged from 4- to 30-fold
   depending on location. Mean weevil abundance increased from 1990
   (<1/stem) through early 1992 (3-4/stem) and then began to decline. The
   number of weevil eggs/stem also peaked in early 1992 and then declined.
   These survey results are consistent with the hypothesis that the weevil
   played an important role in producing both observed declines.
   The effect of weevils on watermilfoil was evaluated in twoexperiments.
   In an aquarium experiment, we found that the viability of stem fragments
   damaged by weevils was reduced compared to stem fragments without weevil
   damage. Watermilfoil commonly spreads by producing fragments so the
   spread of watermilfoil beds by fragmentation may be reduced when weevil
   abundances are high. In a pond enclosure experiment, weevils suppressed
   the production of new watermilfoil biomass. The biomass of lateral stems
   and roots of water milfoil plants damaged by weevils was significantly
   less than those of control plants. There was no significant difference
   in the biomass of the stems originally planted in the enclosures. Weevil
   damage did have a negative effect on the buoyancy of these original
   stems, however. These experimental results also support the hypothesis
   that this native weevil played an important role in the two watermilfoil
   declines observed at Brownington Pond.}},

Abstract = {{This study documents the detrimental effects of human recreation on the
   North American wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta) in Connecticut. We
   chronicled the dynamics of two allopatric wood turtle populations in a
   protected southern New England wildlife reserve for 20 yr (1974-1993).
   Both wood turtle populations were reproductively isolated from one
   another, physically separated approximate to 100 yr ago when a 1.5 km
   long human-made pond was constructed. We conducted a mark-and-recapture
   study on a 1000-ha section of a protected watershed in south-central
   Connecticut (New Haven County). During this study we monitored 133
   different wood turtles, observing them a total of 1176 times. Human and
   wood turtle demographics were recorded throughout this period.
   The data support the following conclusions: (1) following a period of
   apparent stability, two populations of wood turtles declined; (2) the
   declines were more or less synchronous in both populations; (3) the
   beginning of each decline corresponded to the opening of the habitat for
   recreation; (4) an increase in mean turtle age suggests a failure of
   recruitment; however, (5) a simultaneous reduction in numbers of adult
   females suggests that the failure of recruitment alone is not sufficient
   to explain the declines.
   Throughout our study the size of the forest remained the same, road
   building was restricted, and the quality of the air and water were
   constant. The wood turtle populations remained stable when people were
   denied access to the property. When this area was opened to human
   recreation (hiking, fishing) the two discrete wood turtle populations
   declined steadily; the total number of turtles in both populations
   declined by 100\% in 10 yr.
   As wilderness areas become mixed-use recreation areas, wood turtle
   populations may suffer. We conclude that without proper management, the
   increasing recreational use of parks, reservoirs, and wildlife reserves
   will adversely affect the long-term survival of the North American wood
   turtle.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrethroid resistant and susceptible adults of Helicoverpa armigera
   (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were screened for tolerance to pyrethroids
   after 6 wk or 12 wk pupal diapuse. Resistant larvae and F-2 larvae from
   a cross between resistant and susceptible parents (two replicates), were
   reared under conditions to induce pupal diapause. After eclosion, adults
   were tested in glass vials coated with the pyrethroid fenvalerate, at a
   dose (DD) that is known to discriminate between susceptible and
   heterozygous resistant individuals. In all diapause experiments, the
   frequency of resistance was lower in the test groups that had
   experienced diapause compared with the non-diapausing control group. The
   underlying cause of the decline is not certain but selective mortality
   of resistant versus susceptible individuals could not account for all
   the difference in two of the three experiments - tolerance to the
   pyrethroid, fenvalerate, is most likely; to have declined either as a
   consequence of diapause or from the extended time of development
   associated with diapause. These results indicate that monitoring
   programs could underestimate pyrethroid resistance frequencies when
   using H. armigera adults emerging from diapause.}},

Abstract = {{Sun exposure has now been established as the most important avoidable
   cause of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma. With specific
   reference to melanoma, there are several key issues that remain to be
   resolved. These include definition of the action spectrum, the
   importance of systemic effects of sun exposure, whether a tan is
   protective, the risk of tanning booth exposures, and the efficacy of
   sunscreens. Also the role, if any, of sun exposure in noncutaneous
   malignancies remains to be established. Melanoma incidence and mortality
   have increased dramatically over the past several decades, but these
   increases have now slowed, and for mortality among those 15 to 45 years
   of age, decreasing rates are now observed. Improving the coverage of the
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries by
   requiring pathology laboratories in nor-SEER areas to report cancers
   among SEER area residents will allow correct interpretation of these
   trends in the future at minimal cost. The available data on trends in
   NMSC incidence and mortality are suboptimal but suggest a pattern of
   declining mortality despite increasing incidence. Trends in NMSC
   morbidity have not been defined. Establishing NMSC registries in a few
   diverse sentinel areas would allow more reliable inference and
   monitoring. Techniques are being developed for reducing sun exposures
   and increasing early detection of skin cancers in the general
   population, but improved monitoring of incidence, mortality, and
   morbidity is required to monitor the effects of current and future ozone
   depletion and to evaluate prevention and early detection measures.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of very short pulse-exposures with the synthetic pyrethroid
   esfenvalerate on survival and growth of larval crimson-spotted rainbow
   fish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) were investigated in two series of
   experiments. Larval rainbow fish {[}2, 7, or 14 days (d) old] were
   pulse-exposed to esfenvalerate (30-700 ng L(-1)) for 1 h and then
   transferred to growth chambers where survival and growth were monitored
   for periods of 7-28 d, depending on the experimental protocol. Mortality
   was found to be a more sensitive indicator of pesticide effects than
   growth. Effects on growth were only observed in treatments where there
   was significant pesticide-related mortality. In these treatments,
   rainbow fish larvae were larger than control larvae. However, as
   increase in growth was always associated with mortality, it was not
   possible to determine if this was a direct effect of the pesticide or an
   artefact of density-dependent interactions within test populations.
   There was some evidence to suggest that pulse-exposure with
   esfenvalerate at an early age may cause subtle longterm detrimental
   effects to growth of larval rainbow fish. Dry weight and condition
   (length/weight) were more sensitive indicators of treatment effect than
   total length. Esfenvalerate was extremely toxic to larval fish, with 1 h
   pulse-exposures as low as 60 ng L(-1) causing significant mortality.
   Newly hatched larvae were more sensitive to esfenvalerate than animals
   that were 14 d old. The effects of esfenvalerate on 7-d-old larvae could
   not be determined because of high control mortality. Larvae of this age
   undergo transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding and may be more
   sensitive to handling stress. The lowest 1 h pulse-exposure
   esfenvalerate no observed effect concentration and lowest observed
   effect concentration were <60 and 60 ng L(-1) respectively, based on
   2-d-old larval mortality. (C) 1995 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A 5 year study was undertaken in Kielder Forest to examine changes in
   pellet group counts, direct observations, body weight and potential
   fertility in a population of roe deer Capreolus capreolus subjected to
   heavy hunting pressure.
   Over the study period, the mean number of pellet groups per plot and
   mean number of deer observed per hour declined consistently while the
   mean number of hours hunting effort required to remove one deer
   increased. Measuring the rate of accumulation of pellet groups in
   permanent sample plots over 6 month periods appeared to provide a
   reliable method of monitoring changes in population density, as did
   systematic collection of observational data.
   Based on estimates derived from the pellet group counts, the deer
   population was reduced from a density of 12.0 to 3.0 deer km(-1) over
   the study period. In the latter stages, the number of deer removed from
   the population was equal to or greater than the estimated population
   size, suggesting that immigration from the surrounding forest area was a
   major factor affecting population density.
   Despite the significant reduction in population density, the average
   body weight and number of corpora lutea present in female deer was
   apparently unaffected, suggesting that habitat quality (rather than
   population density), was the main determinant of fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Spruce Picea spp, trees in Kielder Forest produced a heavy cone crop in
   1990/1991 but not in 1991/1992. Common crossbills Loxia curvirostra and
   siskins Carduelis spinus rely upon conifer seed for food, and
   consequently large numbers were present in the good cone year. The
   abundance of these two finches was one of the main reasons why songbird
   density was four times higher in 1991 than in 1992. The numbers and
   breeding productivity of two raptors that specialise in hunting
   songbirds were also monitored in both years, Sparrowhawks Accipiter
   nisus appeared to respond to this increased food supply. In 1991 they
   fed on crossbills and siskins, and increased their breeding numbers and
   productivity so that seven times more chicks were reared than in 1992.
   These results indicate that sparrowhawk numbers are likely to fluctuate
   far more in large spruce forests than in other habitats in Britain where
   food supply is more stable. To ensure that spectacular `'crossbill
   years'' occur in future it is important to maintain a diversity of
   coniferous species in forests, including appreciable areas of Norway
   spruce Picea abies, Merlins Falco columbarius did not switch to feeding
   on crossbills and siskins, and their breeding numbers and performance
   were similar between years, Moorland birds were their main food,
   although considerable numbers of woodland songbirds were also taken in
   early spring. These results suggest that forests provide merlins with
   some prey at a time of year when moorland birds are scarce. Thus, the
   planting of large conifer forests may not be detrimental to merlin
   populations, provided that extensive areas of moorland remain nearby.}},

Title = {{THE CONTRIBUTION OF SOME RECENT RESEARCH ON BIRDS TO ECOLOGICAL
   UNDERSTANDING}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{64}},

Pages = {{675-696}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. In this address I discuss the contribution to ecological
   understanding of four aspects of ornithological research, based on
   long-term or large-scale studies.
   2. Long-term population studies of birds, involving marked individuals,
   have provided, for more than 20 species, information on lifetime
   reproductive success (LRS); that is, the total numbers of young raised
   by individuals during their entire lives. LRS values are useful because
   they combine two key measures of performance (annual survival and annual
   breeding success) into a single overall measure, which could give a
   close approximation to Darwinian fitness. In any one bird population,
   LRS values have proved to be markedly skewed, with most individuals in a
   generation producing no young and a few producing many young. Depending
   on species, some 3-9\% of fledglings in one generation produced half the
   young in the next generation.
   3. The application of island biogeography and metapopulation theory to
   the bird populations of woods and other fragmented habitats has
   confirmed the widespread occurrence of the species-area relationship,
   and the importance of the stochastic processes of local extinction and
   recolonization in influencing species numbers and distributions among
   fragments. Certain bird species are found only in habitat patches that
   are two or more orders of magnitude larger than their individual area
   needs, as judged from territory sizes. By implication, the more that
   habitats are fragmented, the more likely are species with special
   habitat or area needs to disappear, and the more the long-term
   persistence of the remaining avifauna depends on chance processes. If
   these points hold for birds, which are among the most mobile of
   organisms, they surely apply to other less mobile taxa.
   4. The nation-wide monitoring of bird populations has revealed long-term
   declines in many bird species in Britain, associated with modern
   land-use practices. Research on birds has been paramount in revealing
   pesticide impacts on non-target species. Some bird populations have been
   affected directly by pesticides reducing their individual reproductive
   or survival rates, while others have been affected indirectly by
   pesticides reducing the abundance of their food organisms, plant or
   animal.
   5. Migration is perhaps more developed in birds than in any other
   animals. It is impressive in terms of the global scale over which it
   occurs, the distances travelled, the large proportion of species
   involved, and the enormous numbers of individual participants. It
   results each year in huge seasonal changes in the distribution of birds
   over the earth's surface, linked to seasonal changes in food supplies.
   In some bird species, annual changes in overall population levels were
   related to conditions on the wintering range, and in other species to
   conditions on the breeding range. Large-scale migration studies have
   raised questions on the factors influencing the geographical ranges of
   birds, and on the relationship between breeding and wintering areas, and
   between abundance and distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The early migration of northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) pups was
   investigated using very high-frequency (VHF) radiotelemetry. In
   1989-1990, 184 pups were radiotagged and monitored to determine the date
   of their departure from St. Paul Island, Alaska. After their departure,
   70 pups were located by receiver stations in the eastern Aleutian
   Islands and by aerial surveys. Mean (+/-1 SD) time of travel between St.
   Paul Island and the Aleutian passes was 11 +/- 6 days (n = 63),
   suggesting that, on average, pups progressed southward at the rate of
   ca. 36-40 km/day. Near the Aleutians, they were distributed throughout
   the study area from Unimak Pass to Samalga Pass, and Unimak Pass was not
   the main migratory route from the Bering Sea into the North Pacific
   Ocean. The pups remained dispersed as migration continued south of the
   Aleutian Islands. The migratory routes of northern fur seal pups in the
   Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean have important implications for their
   pelagic ecology, including the type and availability of prey,
   oceanographic conditions encountered, population dynamics (e.g.,
   survival and reproductive recruitment), and potential for interaction
   with human activities.}},

Abstract = {{Duration of estrus may exceed 24 h in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus). We examined the influence of mating and injected
   gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH; 100 mu g/deer) on duration of
   estrus. Nine adult females were monitored daily for estrous behavior
   during autumn and winter 1991-1992 (31 separate estrous cycles). Estrus
   was assessed using a tractable, epididyectomized adult male. From 13
   November 1991 to 3 January 1992 (experiment 1), adult females in estrus
   were assigned randomly as either control (unbred) or bred to the
   epididyectomized male. In experiment 2, duration of estrus for females
   injected with GnRH was compared with unbred females from 2 February 1992
   to 23 March 1992. For experiment 1, unbred females were in estrus longer
   (P = 0.01) than were females that were bred ((X) over bar +/- SE; 2.3
   +/- 0.3 days versus 1.3 +/- 0.2 days, respectively). For experiment 2,
   duration of estrus for unbred females treated with GnRH did not differ
   (P = 0.48) from those that were not bred (1.7 +/- 0.3 versus 2.0 +/- 0.3
   days, respectively). There was no significant (P = 0.71) change in the
   duration of estrus for unbred females between the two experiments.
   Copulation may shorten the duration of behavioral estrus. Administration
   of exogenous GnRH did not shorten duration of estrus. Prolonged duration
   of estrus for unbred females may be a mechanism to help ensure all
   females are bred even in populations with low numbers of males.}},

Abstract = {{Coexisting populations of the mussels, Perna perna and Mytilus

   coast, east of Algiers, over a five year period (1985-1989). While
   spatfalls were observed throughout the year, only the major
   spring-summer recruitment, which occurred during favourable weather
   conditions, contributed to the renewal of both mussel species at both
   sites. Very high densities (>10,000 ind. m(-2)) wore observed at both
   sites, but the mussel beds were composed principally of young and small
   specimens due to harvesting of the largest animals for use as bait and
   for human consumption. The maximal length observed was 75 mm in P, perna
   and 49 mm in M. galloprovincialis. The life span of the species was low,
   12-24 months in P. perna and 11-28 months in M. galloprovincialis. This
   survey showed that M. galloprovincialis became dominant in both mussel
   beds due to its resistance to disturbance by human activities.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution reflectance spectra in the range of 400-850 nm were
   obtained from Lake Kinneret during a period when dense populations of
   the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense dominated the phytoplankton.
   Chlorophyll (Chi) concentrations ranged from 5.1 to 185 mg m(-3) and
   from 2.4 to 187.5 mg m(-3) in the samples of two independent
   experiments. The most prominent features of the reflectance spectra
   were: (i) a wide minimum from 400 to 500 nm; (ii) a maximum at 550-570
   nm, which did not surpass 3\% in samples with high Chl concentration
   (>20 mg m(-3)), indicating a strong absorption by pigments in the green
   range of the spectrum; (iii) a minimum at 616 nm; this was similar to
   1\% and was almost insensitive to variation in Chi concentration >10 mg
   m(-3); (iv) a maximum reflectance showed near 700 nm; its magnitude and
   position were highly dependent on chlorophyll concentration.
   High-spectral-resolution data were used as a guideline for selection of
   the most suitable spectral bands for chlorophyll remote sensing. Models
   were devised, based on the calculation of the integrated area above the
   baseline from 670 to 850 nm and the reflectance maximal height within
   this range. Some algorithms already used in previous studies were tested
   and showed a plausible degree of accuracy when applied to the current
   data base. However, novel models devised in this study improved
   substantially the accuracy of Chi estimation by remotely sensed data, by
   reducing the estimation error from >11 to 6.5 mg m(-3). Those models
   were validated by an independent data set where Chi concentration ranged
   over two orders of magnitude. The use of three relatively narrow
   spectral bands was sufficient for Chi mapping in Lake Kinneret.
   Therefore, a relatively simple sensor, measuring only a few bands will
   be employed in future applications for Chl monitoring in inland waters.
   Radiometric data were also used to simulate radiances in the channels of
   TM Landsat and to find the algorithm for Chi assessment. The ratio of
   channel 4 to channel 3 was used and enabled Chl estimation with an error
   of <15 mg m(-3). This algorithm was employed to map Chl in the entire
   area of Lake Kinneret with 10 gradations.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed particle microcontamination measurements were made in Class 100
   and Class IO {[}unidirectional flow, or vertical laminar flow (VLF)]
   environments used as final assembly and electro-optical assembly areas,
   respectively, at Particle Measuring Systems, Inc. (PMS), Two groups of
   measuring instruments monitoring the two areas included four laser
   particle counters (LPCs) and three condensation nucleus counters (CNCs).
   The utility of both types of measurements in these environments is
   discussed relative to sensitivity, flow rate, and background noise.
   These data indicate that the statistical advantage of CNCs over 1 cu
   ft/min LPCs can only be achieved at flow rates > 0.50 cu ft/min. The
   most prevalent range of particle sizes is limited to those near the most
   penetrating particle size, The higher count rare of lower flow rate CNC
   and LPC instruments was also found to be a factor in quantifying
   episodic events and transient populations. Outside ambient air was shown
   to be the major contributor to in-room particle counts under the
   conditions studied here.}},

Abstract = {{During spring and summer 1993, we monitored settlement of crabs
   (primarily Cancer spp.) and sea urchins Strongylocentrotus spp. in
   conjunction with physical variables associated with coastal circulation
   to investigate how physical conditions influence the spatial
   distribution of recruitment along the coast. Observations were made
   along a 100 km stretch of the northern California coast (USA), from the
   Gulf of the Farallones north to Point Arena. Temperature, salinity and
   wind stress data indicated fluctuations in upwelling and provided
   evidence for the alongshore, northward flow of warm, low salinity water
   during upwelling relaxation events which typically lasted several days.
   On a weekly time scale, crab settlement was positively correlated with
   temperature, and negatively correlated with salinity, indicating that
   settlement, occurred during relaxation events. Correlations were higher
   north of Point Reyes, where high settlement occurred only during
   relaxation, than south of Point Reyes, where settlement occurred both
   during relaxation events and to a lesser degree during upwelling.
   Overall crab settlement was higher south of Point Reyes. On a daily time
   scale, crab settlement north of Point Reyes was associated with the
   sharp increase in temperature observed as the relaxation current reached
   that point on the coast. This association suggested that crabs were
   transported northward alongshore in the thermal front which propagated
   northward during each relaxation event. This alongshore transport
   mechanism may be responsible for the predictable pattern of settlement
   variability within this system: with continuous, event-modulated
   settlement south of Point Reyes and episodic, event-dependent settlement
   to the north. Similar physical/biological interactions may occur at
   other points along this coast and along the midlatitude boundaries of
   other oceans.}},

Abstract = {{Mussels Mytilus edulis, collected from 26 coastal sites from the
   Shetland Islands to the Thames estuary and 8 offshore Light vessels,
   were used to monitor changes in environmental quality along the North
   Sea coastline of the UK (July 1990 and August 1991). The combined
   measurements of the stress response, scope for growth (SFG), and
   chemical contaminants in the tissues of mussels were able to detect,
   quantify and identify some of the major toxicants causing the observed
   pollution effects. SFG declined from north to south, reflecting both the
   major inflow of clean water from the North Atlantic via the north of
   Scotland, and the overall increase in environmental contamination with
   increasing urbanisation and industrialisation towards the south. There
   were coastal regions (e.g. Humber-Wash area and the Thames estuary) as
   well as specific sites (e.g. Ythan, Montrose, Blyth, Teesmouth, Whitby)
   which showed markedly reduced SFG. Using experimentally derived tissue
   concentration-response relationships it was shown that at over half the
   sites the reduced SFG could be entirely explained by the recorded
   concentrations of contaminants in the tissues. At the majority of sites,
   a large contribution towards the observed decline in SFG was caused by
   toxic (mainly polyaromatic) hydrocarbons, largely reflecting
   urbanisation and shipping activity. in addition, reductions in SFG
   appear to be partially explained by the accumulation of significant
   amounts of `polar organic compounds' and tributyltin. At no sites were
   metals accumulated to concentrations that could cause a significant
   reduction in SFG. At those sites with a large `unexplained component' to
   the very low SFG values, there was a significant correlation between
   this `residual unexplained toxicity' and concentrations of
   organochlorines in the mussels. More research on the toxicity of these
   organochlorine compounds to mussels is needed.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the Likely cause of the dramatic decrease in abundance
   experienced by a population of reef-building polychaetes Phragmatopoma
   virgini Kinberg, 1867 at the low rocky intertidal of the Mehuin Marine
   Reserve, southern Chile. The abundance level there contrasts strongly
   with the levels of abundance that this species has outside the area. To
   determine if this decrease resulted from processes operating in the
   post-settlement stage, we offered textured and untextured cement plates
   as substrata for settling P. virgini. In addition, in order to assess
   the effect of mobile consumers on post-settlement mortality, we enclosed
   settlement plates in cages. After 18 mo of monitoring the abundance of
   recruits on the artificial plates, we determined that recruitment occurs
   throughout the year, but with a clear seasonal variation in intensity.
   Recruitment densities were highest on rough textured plates. The
   exclusion of consumers resulted in a major increase in the number of
   recruits on both types of surface. The higher density of recruits on the
   rough surfaces was probably the result of microenvironmental conditions
   that enhance settlement and survival of the new settlers by providing a
   refuge from mobile consumers, specifically dislodgement by rasping
   invertebrates. We concluded that the decrease observed in the population
   of P. virgini at the Marine Reserve is the result of higher
   postsettlement mortality produced by predation activity of high
   densities of mobile consumers within this reserve.}},

Abstract = {{The population dynamics of insects in a spatially fragmented environment
   were studied by examining three main aspects of their ecology, namely,
   rates of local population extinction, density dependence in population
   change, and movements between populations. Ten phytophagous insects and
   seven parasitoids inhabiting the flowerheads of two herbaceous plants,
   Centaurea nigra and Arctium minus, were studied by monitoring their
   populations on more than 50 patches of each plant, scattered over 5
   km(2) of arable farmland. The results were used to test the relative
   importance of immigration and of local population regulation to
   population persistence. This paper describes the rates of local
   extinction of the various species and the density-dependent factors
   operating on their populations. Local extinction was found to be a
   regular feature of these populations, especially on the smaller patches
   of the plants. Density dependence was identified in the changes in
   population sizes between generations of eight species (five herbivores
   and three parasitoids). Parasitoids appeared to be incapable of
   regulating their host populations, in the four host species for which we
   have data. Populations of all species were, however, limited by their
   food resources, and their numbers tracked changes, both spatially and
   temporally, in resource availability. The implications of these findings
   to population theory are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The population dynamics of ten species of phytophagous insects and seven
   parasitoids inhabiting the flowerheads of two herbaceous plants,
   Centaurea nigra and Arctium minus, were studied, and three main aspects
   of their ecology were examined, namely, rates of population extinction,
   density dependence in population changes from one generation to the
   next, and movements between populations. The study was based on
   monitoring the insect populations on more than 50 patches of each plant,
   scattered over 5 km(2) of arable farmland and the results were used to
   test the relative importance of immigration and population regulation to
   the persistence of these populations. This paper describes the study of
   movements between patches of food plant. Experimentally planted new
   patches of plants were rapidly colonised by all species and this
   appeared to be unaffected by distance from a source population, up to
   the maximum distance of 800 m considered in the experiment. Large
   patches tended to be colonised more readily than small ones. Movements
   between plant patches were studied with the use of chemical markers (Rb,
   Sr, Dy and Cs) which were applied as chloride salts to individual
   patches, and which were translocated to the flowerheads and so to
   insects feeding on the seed, and to their parasitoids. Initial
   experiments in the laboratory showed that these elements could be
   readily detected by ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) mass spectrometry
   in the bodies of all species reared on potted plants sprayed with
   solutions containing them. Background levels of strontium were patchily
   high on the study area, but the other elements were naturally either
   absent or in very low concentrations. Four patches of each plant were
   marked with a different element in 1991. In 1992, samples of four
   species of tephritid fly and two parasitoids were collected from all
   patches, and analysed for the four elements. These analyses showed that
   individuals of all species moved considerable distances, with movements
   of up to 2 km being commonly recorded. Estimates of rates of immigration
   to patches showed that movement plays an important role in the
   population dynamics of these insects, There was some evidence that
   immigration was density-dependent: it was highest when the resident
   populations (numbers per flowerhead) were low.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae were collected from wheat
   and cocksfoot stands around Hampshire, UK, during March and April 1994.
   Eight wheat and eight cocksfoot aphid clones were chosen on the basis of
   readily distinguishable RAPD-PCR fingerprint profiles. The performances
   (weight, fecundity and survival) of successive generations of each of
   these clones were then carefully monitored in the laboratory as new
   generations of aphids were transferred either to winter wheat or to
   cocksfoot in planned sequences. Even those clones that were originally
   caught on the same host showed significant variability in performance.
   Clones generally performed better on their host of origin than they did
   on the alternate host, and they performed less well on the alternate
   host compared to the clones that had originated there. A comparison of
   the performance of third generation aphids with first generation aphids
   showed that the experience of the mother in the second generation often
   influences the subsequent performance of their offspring. As the
   sequence of host transfers had more effect on the performance of wheat
   clones than cocksfoot clones, it is likely that wheat clones are more
   specialised, such that wheat is a satisfactory host for cocksfoot clones
   but not vice versa. The study provides evidence of genetic variation in
   performance on hosts and evidence for clonal adaptation to particular
   host species. This adaptation may well be a major cause of the observed
   consistent genetic differentiability of populations of S. avenae found
   on wheat and roadside grasses in early spring in southern England.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorella was used to study the effects of dehydration on photosynthetic
   activities. The use of unicellular green algae assured that the extent
   of dehydration was uniform throughout the whole cell population during
   the course of desiccation. Changes in the activities of the cells were
   monitored by measurements of fluorescence induction kinetics. It was
   found that inhibition of most of the photosynthetic activities started
   at a similar level of cellular water content. They included CO2
   fixation, photochemical activity of Photosystem II and electron
   transport through Photosystem I. The blockage of electron flow through
   Photosystem I was complete and the whole transition occurred within a
   relative short time of dehydration. On the other hand, the suppression
   of Photosystem II activity was incomplete and the transition took a
   longer time of dehydration. Upon rehydration, the inhibition of
   Photosystem II activity was fully reversible when samples were in the
   middle of the transition, but was not thereafter. The electron transport
   through Photosystem I was also reversible during the transition, but was
   only partially afterward.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain a genetically marked strain of Trichoderma harzianum that can
   be used as a tool for studies of population dynamics, T. harzianum was
   cotransformed with the Escherichia coli uidA beta-glucuronidase (GUS)
   gene and the hygromycin B (hygB) gene as the selective marker. To
   improve the efficiency of conditions used for the transformation, the
   isolation, reversion, and germination of mycelial protoplasts were
   studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Hexamethyldisilzane was
   useful for preparing protoplasts from suspensions for SEM. It was
   essential to obtain a transformant that phenotypically resembled the
   wild-type. After mitotic stabilization of the transformants by
   single-spore isolations, three transformants were compared to the
   wild-type by measurement of spore germination and mycelial growth rates,
   identification of secondary metabolite profiles, and studies of
   extracellular proteins. One transformant, T3c, was dissimilar to the
   wild-type in most tests, whereas transformant T3a was physiologically
   very similar to the wild-type. Furthermore, transformant T3a remained
   genetically stable during nonselective cultivation on plates and in
   sterile peat-bran.}},

Abstract = {{Population development, activity, and stability of a beta-glucuronidase
   (GUS)-transformed strain of Trichoderma harzianum were studied in the
   rhizosphere of cucumber plants grown in sphagnum peat. When compared to
   the wild-type isolate, there was no significant difference in terms of
   population development (CFU/g of sphagnum peat). In a treatment with a
   combination of the wild-type isolate and the transformant, the
   proportion of GUS-active colonies on plates was constant throughout the
   experiment. On that basis, we concluded that the transformant was
   genetically stable when grown in a natural potting mixture. GUS was
   extracted from infested rhizosphere peat and assayed
   spectrophotometrically. The activity curve was inversely related to the
   population curve. Quantification of activated conidia by fluorescein
   diacetate staining indicated that GUS activity correlated with the
   activity of the fungus. Hyphae of Y. harzianum stained with
   5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-beta-D-glucuronide were easily detected on the
   roots, especially around small wounds, such as damaged epidermal cells.
   Colonization of wounds may be important for the antagonistic effect of
   the organism, because it may block a possible way for pathogens to
   infect root tissue. Our results demonstrate the suitability of using a
   GUS transformant for detecting and monitoring a specific strain of T.

Abstract = {{Age-0 bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix were widely distributed and
   seasonally abundant in shallow beach habitats of Narragansett Bay, Rhode
   Island. Based on length-frequency data that were polymodal in some
   years, these age-0 fish comprised spring- and summer-spawned cohorts.
   Cohort-specific measures of abundance, growth, total mortality and
   emigration, and size were determined for 1982-1992. In all years,
   spring-spawned fish dominated the catch from at least July to September.
   For this cohort, annual abundance varied by an order of magnitude,
   growth ranged from 0.9 to 2.1 mm/d, total mortality and emigration rates
   were between 0.2 and 2.8\%/d, and mean length on October 1 ranged from
   164 to 248 mm fork length. Spring-spawned fish were about twice as large
   as summer-spawned fish by October, Summer-spawned fish also occurred
   less frequently and in lower abundance. These findings confirm that
   Narragansett Bay is an important nursery for bluefish, and that the
   trend toward declining annual abundance measured in this bay is
   concordant with the reported decline of bluefish throughout the western
   Atlantic. Correlation analysis with data for only the spring-spawned
   cohort suggested density-dependent (i.e., compensatory) processes
   occurred; growth decreased monotonically but not linearly, relative to
   abundance, whereas combined mortality and emigration rates increased
   linearly. Measures of abundance were also a function of seine-net size;
   seines less than 25 m long were particularly ineffective for collecting
   age-0 bluefish. These relationships suggest that monitoring age-0 fish
   in estuaries may help predict future population size.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the identification of the main air pollution sources
   in the Balearic islands (Spain) from statistical energy consumption
   values, establishing the appropriate empirical emission factors. Results
   are compared with measured values obtained from stack isoldnetic
   sampling and laboratory analytical determinations. The emissions from
   1986 and 1991 are compared to check the evolving pattern of emissions.
   The most important conclusions are: (1) the absolute values of emitted
   pollutants (SO2, NOx, TSP) do not reveal cause for concern and are
   improving with time as better fuels are used based upon air quality data
   measured by monitoring stations in Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza, whose
   results are always below the guide values fixed by the European Union
   Directives; (2) the major impact is produced in the island of Mallorca,
   due to the size of its stable and visitor populations, as well as its
   industrial installations.}},

Abstract = {{Biochemical biomarkers measure the exposure of organisms to
   environmental chemicals. They can also provide measures of toxic effect,
   e.g. where they are based on molecular mechanisms which underly
   toxicity. Ideally, biomarkers should be sensitive, specific, simple to
   use and suitable for the assay of material obtained by non-destructive
   sampling procedures (e.g. of blood). Recently, there has been
   encouraging progress in the development of several different types of
   biomarker assays: (1) The measurement of inhibition of serum `B'
   esterases to monitor exposure of birds to organophosphorus insecticides.
   (2) The measurement of DNA damage caused by aromatic hydrocarbons. DNA
   adduct formation has been studied using the P-32-postlabelling
   technique. Several other techniques are currently under investigation.
   (3) The measurement of disturbances to the transthyretin-retinol binding
   protein complex caused by a metabolite of 3,4,3',4',tetrachlorobiphenyl.
   (4) The measurement of precursors of clotting proteins in blood
   following the inhibition of the Vitamin K cycle by anticoagulant
   rodenticides. Of these examples, the first is only a biomarker of
   exposure but the remaining three examples are, in principle, biomarkers
   of toxic effect since they all represent measures of molecular
   mechanisms which underly toxicity. Biochemical biomarkers have
   considerable potential for measuring effects of chemicals under field
   conditions - especially where carefully selected combinations of them
   are used.}},

Abstract = {{The year 1992 in the Southern California Eight is embedded in a 17-year
   warm anomaly which is the longest in the 1922-94 period. The length of
   the warm anomaly may make it more useful for studying the effects of
   global change on fish with generation times of 5 years than the usual
   ENSO event lasting 1-3 years. The trend since 1985 of zooplankton volume
   and anchovy spawning biomass has been downward, and that of sardine has
   been upward. Although the trends in the growth rates of fish populations
   can be observed, the causes result from the combined effects of the
   environment in the absence of a significant fishery. Directed,
   long-term, process-oriented research on the anchovy and the more
   subtropical sardine is needed to `'explain'' differences in population
   growth rates: incidental data from static monitoring and fish stock
   assessment are necessary but will not likely be sufficient to construct
   combined effects of temperature and zooplankton on population growth
   rates of sardine and anchovy.}},

Abstract = {{Spacing patterns in mammals are influenced by mating systems such as
   polygyny -promiscuity. Movement parameters were monitored over 3 years
   in an increasing population of ermine, Mustela erminea cicognanii, in
   southern Quebec (45 degrees 22'N, 71 degrees 51'W), and the effects of
   age, sex, breeding status, and annual densities on movements were
   examined. Residency times (range 24-443 d) were significantly higher in
   females than in males. Populations were composed of more visiting males
   than residents and more resident females than visiting females. Adult
   and juvenile males travelled significantly more than adult females and
   during the year of highest density than in other years. Males' travel
   distances significantly decreased and those of females increased during
   the postbreeding season. Males' home range sizes (range 1.0-87.4 ha)
   were significantly larger than those of females during the postbreeding
   period and over the whole season. Home ranges overlapped only between
   the sexes. Our study showed little influence of annual variations in
   population density on spacing patterns. We conclude that (i) movements
   in Nearctic ermine populations are, at moderate to high population
   levels, influenced by intraspecific characteristics, and (ii) in view of
   the similar behavior of Palaearctic and Nearctic ermine, interdemic body
   size range has little influence on spacing patterns of ermine.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that helminth parasitism is demographically
   significant to a noncyclic population of snowshoe hares (Lepus
   americanus) near the species' geographic boundary in central Wisconsin
   (U.S.A.). During November 1988 to December 1991, we injected 93
   individuals (greater than or equal to 760 g, aged greater than or equal
   to 2 months) with anthelmintics: Ivermectin for nematode and Droncit for
   cestode infections. We injected 98 control hares with propylene glycol,
   the common vehicle for both drugs. All treated and control hares were
   radio-collared with mortality-sensing transmitters and monitored daily
   to weekly from the ground or air. Prevalence and intensity of lungworms
   (Protostrongylus boughtoni), intestinal worms (Nematodirus
   triangularis), and stomach worms (Obeliscoides cuniculi) were markedly
   reduced by Ivermectin treatment. No other nematodes were found to be
   present. Treatment with Droncit to remove intestinal cestodes was
   apparently unnecessary, as prevalence among necropsied untreated hares
   and controls was just 10\%. We compared body-condition indices (mass
   changes, response to trap stress, and bone-marrow fat), reproduction
   (pregnancy rate and litter size), home-range sizes, and time-specific
   survival rates of anthelmintic-treated Versus control hares. None of
   these demographic variables differed significantly between treated and
   control cohorts, nor was there any evidence that parasitism increased
   the risk of death from predation, which was the proximate cause of 96\%
   of all natural mortalities. We conclude that helminth parasitism played
   no detectable role in the dynamics of this Wisconsin snowshoe hare
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Catches per unit of effort (CPUE) with experimental gill nets,
   recruitment. growth. and condition were monitored between 1977 and 1992
   to evaluate the impact of impoundment on the main fish species of La
   Grande 2, Opinaca, and Caniapiscau reservoirs and the Boyd-Sakami
   diversion. CPUE and recruitment of northern pike (Esox lucius) and lake
   whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) increased markedly at most stations
   after impoundment and decreased at the end of the series. The lake
   whitefish and cisco (Coregonus artedii) showed their most striking rise
   in CPUE at two bay stations of La Grande 2 and Opinaca reservoirs. CPUE
   and recruitment of the longnose sucker (Carostomus catostomus), white
   sucker (Catostomus commersoni), and lake trout (Salvelinus namaysuch)
   (Caniapiscau) showed a general decrease following impoundment. CPUE for
   the walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) also decreased at several stations;
   however, the two most southerly stations in La Grande 2 reservoir and
   the Boyd-Sakami station showed high CPUE during the series.
   Concentration-redistribution phenomena explain part of the observed
   variations in CPUE. Correlation analyses showed that walleyes and whits
   suckers were attracted to the warmer, more turbid stations, and that the
   high primary and secondary productivity of bay stations attracted the
   coregonines. Growth and condition of the main species increased during
   variable time intervals after impoundment and decreased at the end of
   the series.}},

Abstract = {{Syntopic populations of bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), green frogs (Rana
   clamitans) and mink frogs (Rana septentrionalis) were monitored between
   May and October in each of 1985 through 1987 and 1991 through 1993 in
   Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. We assessed the descriptive
   and predictive utility of a dichotomous system for classification of
   anuran life histories by testing the hypothesis that large body size and
   large clutch size are associated with a survivorship curve in which
   mortality is highest for very small individuals. Ages of individuals
   were estimated from size-frequency and recapture data. Survivorship and
   longevity were estimated from standing age distributions smoothed with
   the log-polynomial method. Survivorship was also estimated by comparing
   the number of animals in an age-class in a given year with the number in
   the next age-class in the next year. Age distributions were unstable in
   all three species. The strengths and weaknesses of both methods of
   estimation of survivorship are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Thirteen red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were radio-tracked between September
   1989 and August 1993 in the Swiss Jura mountains. Home ranges of
   subadult and adult resident foxes did not differ and were small
   (seasonal estimates 0.48-3.06 km(2)). A nomadic adult was also
   monitored; it used a significantly larger area (12.71-25.90 km(2)). In
   most cases, home range sizes did not vary seasonally and were not
   affected by drastic changes in food availability. That foxes maintain a
   constant territory size is in accordance with both the `'contractor''
   and `'obstinate'' strategies. The small observed sizes suggest that
   after the eradication of rabies, rural areas of central Europe are very
   good habitats for foxes. In the absence of clumped feeding patches or
   constraining factors (e.g.. deep snow cover), the foxes moved regularly
   throughout their home range, typically in a `'non-oriented zigzag.'' The
   distance travelled per day seemed to be affected only by home range size
   (positive correlation) and occasionally, according to the individual, by
   weather or snow cover. On average. the foxes moved 3.9-12.0 km a day.
   Despite its significantly larger home range, the nomadic fox did not
   move more than the resident foxes; the physical characteristics of red
   foxes probably set a limit to the distance travelled daily.}},

Abstract = {{As extinction due to loss of habitat grows more imminent for a wide
   variety of species, population management has been recognized as an
   important means toward species survival and recovery in the wild.
   Genetic management practices generally seek to preserve population
   variation at the level of the genome. It has been proposed however that
   such efforts should instead be directed to specific loci harboring
   alleles with particular selective benefits. This strategy may in fact
   result in greater loss of variation in the rest of the genome,
   potentially threatening population viability. Pedigrees of Przewalski's
   horse (Equus prezewalskii) and the California Condor (Gymnogyps
   californianus) were used to evaluate a `'rare kinship'' management
   strategy in which a single individual known to carry a unique allele is
   repeatedly bred to mates chosen by mean kinship in order to increase the
   frequency of the rare allele. This strategy led to increased population
   mean kinship and reduced gene diversity and founder genome equivalents
   relative to a no-management control pedigree and performed considerably
   worse than a pedigree managed for mean kinship Reduced success in the
   breeding program can be directly attributed to significant deviations of
   founders' representations from their respective target values. As a
   result, a strategy for increasing the frequency of rare alleles cannot
   be generally recommended for management of captive populations. Under
   strict conditions, however, limited use of this strategy may be
   applicable only if used for a short time under careful monitoring by
   pedigree analysis. Even if these conditions are met, managing by a more
   conventional method such as mean kinship is preferable. These results
   illustrate the utility of thoughtful analysis of pedigree information to
   successful population management.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the strength, frequency, and nature of density-dependent
   processes in natural plant populations, the densities of two perennial
   grass species, Bouteloua rigidiseta and Aristida longiseta, were
   perturbed in an otherwise undisturbed community. Both seed additions and
   adult removals, of each species separately, were used. Individual plant
   survival, growth, and reproduction were monitored, as well as
   recruitment to the population and the numbers in each size class of each
   species, for 5 yr.
   The responses to the experimental perturbations were small relative to
   the magnitude of the perturbations, indicating that density dependence
   in demographic parameters in both populations was weak throughout the
   period. The results therefore do not support the suggestion of Fowler
   (1986) that the weak density dependence in the Bouteloua rigidiseta
   population in the ist yr of the experiment was a temporary result of
   drought.
   Significant responses to the density manipulations were scattered among
   annual intervals, characters, and replicates. This may be simply a
   result of testing responses at the limits of detectability, or it may
   reflect intermittent and scattered density dependence. Density effects
   were generally much smaller than other differences among quadrats and
   differences among plants within quadrats, indicating that other factors
   had much more effect on a plant's fate.}},

Abstract = {{A census of small mammal populations was taken, and freeze-dried gypsy
   moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), pupae were placed at 6 sites near the
   leading edge of moth spread into the southeastern United States. Pupal
   predation was monitored during 3 consecutive nights and a significant
   relationship between the number of live small mammals and predation was
   observed. There was a significant inverse relationship between
   vertebrate and invertebrate predation levels. Pupal predation by
   vertebrates increased as small mammal density increased,; but
   invertebrate predation apparently decreased with increasing small mammal
   density. At all sites, pupae were preyed on beginning the Ist night of
   exposure, suggesting that the native generalist predator complex should
   exhibit no time lag in recognizing and accepting gypsy moth pupae as a
   new food item. The percentage of intact pupae preyed on by vertebrates
   increased from day 1 to day 2 but then declined on day 3. In contrast,
   invertebrate predation increased from day 1 to day 2 and remained at the
   higher rate on day 3. These observations are discussed in relation to
   behavioral characteristics of the predator populations.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of seven variable enzyme loci and multiple-locus
   heterozygosity on time to death (TTD) during an acute 96-h copper
   exposure were examined by two failure-time regression models. Allozymes
   for five enzyme loci (GPI-1({*}), GPI-2({*}), IDHP-1({*}), MDH-2({*}),
   and PGM({*})) were significantly related to TTD. Heterozygosity was not
   significantly related to TTD. Fish weight was found to have a negative
   relationship with TTD, larger fish having shorter TTD. This unusual
   relationship may have resulted from differential survivorship of
   individuals with sensitive and resistant alleles at the MDH-2({*}) and
   the IDHP-1({*}) loci. For the IDHP-1({*}) locus the allele ({*})a was
   associated with increased copper survivorship; however, it was also
   associated with small size. Conversely, the allele ({*})a at the
   MDH-2({*}) locus, which was present in higher frequency in larger fish,
   was associated with decreased survivorship. These results indicate that
   genetic selection for one characteristic may have a negative impact on
   other characteristics. Survivors of the copper exposure were genetically
   selected for copper resistance, resulting in the significant reduction
   in frequencies of several sensitive genotypes in the population. We
   conclude that monitoring population genetic structure and frequency
   changes of sensitive genotypes is a useful biomarker.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale aquatic mesocosm studies were formerly required by the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for ecological risk assessment in
   pesticide registration. However, the use of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis
   macrochirus; Rafinesque) to evaluate pesticide effects on fish
   reproduction in large mesocosms (>300 m(3)) resulted in
   over-exploitation of invertebrates by large numbers of young-of-the-year
   (YOY) bluegill, thus confounding the interpretation of pesticide
   effects. As an alternative, a reproduction study with fathead minnows
   (Pimephales promelas Rafinesque) was conducted in 17-m(3) outdoor
   microcosms. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects
   of varying sex ratios of 20 adult fathead minnows (FHMs) on their
   reproduction during a 4.5-month period. The outcome of this study was
   compared to a bluegill reproduction study in 400-m(3) mesocosms
   conducted synchronously. The logistics of monitoring the microcosms were
   simpler, and harvesting FHMs from microcosms took considerably less
   effort in comparison to harvesting bluegills from mesocosms. The FHMs
   produced a smaller number of larger young in comparison to bluegills,
   which produced large numbers of less mature YOY. The variability in
   total fish biomass between replicates was greater in the bluegill study,
   resulting in less statistical power to detect biomass effects. The FHM
   sex ratios significantly affected reproduction and growth, thus altering
   the fish population structure, despite similar stocking densities. Sex
   ratios with similar numbers of males and females produced a lower total
   biomass and number of YOY. There was no evidence of system
   carrying-capacity constraints on FHM growth or reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton standing stocks have shown a steady decline in Galveston
   Bay, Texas over the last 20 years. Phytoplankton provides the primary
   food resource for oyster populations in Galveston Bay. We used a
   time-dependent population dynamics model of oyster populations to
   examine the impact of a decline in phytoplankton stocks on oyster
   populations. Simulations were run with two different types of mortality:
   winter mortality, assuming that the oyster fishery is the primary source
   of mortality; and summer mortality, assuming that predators and disease
   are the primary source of mortality, All simulations showed the same
   qualitative trends. Market-size adults disappear from the population in
   about 4 years, with an approximate 15\% decline in food supply.
   Submarket-size adults maintained an increasing or steady population
   density for 10-14 years, after which the populations crashed to near
   extinction in 2-4 years. The proximate cause was a cessation in
   reproductive activity when food supply ceased to be sufficient to
   generate a fall spawn, an approximate 60\% drop in food from current
   levels in Galveston Bay. The temporal sequence of mortality affected the
   outcome very little, The simulations suggest that populations decline
   rapidly in response to declining food supplies because a minimum food
   level is required to support a market-size population and a minimal
   reproductive activity. The simulations suggest that a reduction in
   market-size individuals is the primary early-warning signal of decreased
   food supply within the affected population and that this warning signal
   might easily be mistaken for overfishing. Proper management requires the
   monitoring of food supply and the use of a mathematical model to assess
   the importance of observed declines in population abundance.
   Unfortunately, once the fishery is affected, little time may remain
   before the termination of spawning and population extinction.}},

Abstract = {{1. Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) cease feeding before entering their
   home river to undertake upriver migration and spawning. Here we examine
   whether the onset of this anorexia is related to body condition and/or
   gonad development.
   2. The food intake and growth rate of 100 individually marked
   one-sea-winter fish (stocked in an outdoor tank) were monitored
   regularly over 11 weeks during summer. The relative size of body lipid
   reserves, lean mass and gonad size were estimated in all maturing
   females in midsummer and at the end of the experiment.
   3. The date on which individual fish stopped feeding varied greatly;
   after ceasing to feed all lost weight at a consistent rate of 0.1\% per
   day.
   4. The onset of anorexia was significantly correlated with estimates of
   fat reserves, lean mass and gonad size. However multivariate analysis
   showed that lean mass was most important. Female salmon thus appear to
   continue feeding until their lean mass has reached threshold levels. The
   evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed with respect
   to inter-population variation in the length and relative difficulty of
   upriver migration.}},

   diamondback moths. Three and five virgin females were more attractive
   than the two-component lures, which were as attractive as lures that

Abstract = {{Experiments on the development of a sticky trap monitoring system for
   the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), were carried out in six
   cabbage fields (two in each of three villages) in North Sulawesi,
   Indonesia. This region is characterized by small, closely-situated,
   fields. Yellow cardboard traps with a sticky upper surface were placed
   10 cm below the crop canopy, four traps per field, and were maintained
   throughout the 1991 growing season. Larvae were sampled weekly in
   quadrats centred around each trap. One village where continuous cabbage
   growing occurred had higher P. xylostella populations than the other two
   villages, where growing is discontinuous. Although the relationship
   between trap catches and larval populations for individual fields was
   weak, the relationship between catches in all fields pooled and larval
   populations 2 weeks later was very strong, suggesting that a region-wide
   predictive system would be feasible. An increase in larval numbers as
   distance from the traps increased further suggests that sticky traps may
   have potential for use in mass trapping.}},

Abstract = {{A glass vial bioassay procedure was used to monitor insecticide
   resistance to organophosphorus, carbarnate, and cyclodiene insecticides
   in field populations of adult male tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens
   (F.). These tests indicated that resistance was present in field
   populations in Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi in 1992 and 1993.
   Diagnostic concentrations needed to distinguish susceptible tobacco
   budworms from those that were heterozygous and homozygous for resistance
   were as follows: profenofos (10 mu g per vial), methomyl (1 mu g per
   vial), and endosulfan (1 mu g per vial). The seasonal pattern of
   resistance was similar for all insecticides in that relative proportions
   of resistant genotypes peaked in midseason and declined late in the
   season. The occurrence of resistance was higher in 1999 than in 1993.
   The data presented suggest that resistance management is possible with
   these insecticides just as it is with pyrethroids and strategies to
   manage resistance should involve conservative use of all classes of
   insecticides for tobacco budworm control.}},

   major mechanism of resistance to this insecticide. Percentage of
   survival of several partially resistant tobacco budworm populations at
   diagnostic concentrations of profenofos and methomyl was highly
   correlated, suggesting the same mechanism confers resistance to these
   insecticides. Differences between resistant and susceptible tobacco
   budworms in inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by tetrachlorvinfos
   (7-fold), methomyl (7.6-fold), and carbaryl (4-fold) indicated that
   target-site insensitivity was a major mechanism of resistance to
   organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides. The high correlation of
   survival of field tobacco budworm populations exposed to diagnostic
   concentrations of endosulfan and dieldrin suggested that the same
   mechanism (target-site) conferred resistance to both insecticides.
   Measurements of penetration of radiolabeled profenofos indicated that a
   decrease in insecticide uptake may be an additional resistance factor in
   the tobacco budworm. Because target-site resistance to insecticides is
   expressed in both larvae and adults, monitoring for resistance in adults
   is appropriate with these insecticides.}},

Abstract = {{A dry plastic insect trap for monitoring populations of tephritid fruit
   flies is described. The plastic trap is constructed of acetate him that
   is painted to provide a visual cue and contains a toxicant panel that
   provides a visual cue and a feeding stimulant to flies that have entered
   the trap. The trap baited with a e-component blend of ammonium acetate
   and putrescine was tested against feral populations of the Mediterranean
   fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), and the Mexican fruit fly,
   Anastrepha ludens (Loew), in field trials conducted in Guatemala. The
   combination of ammonium acetate and putrescine was better than either
   ammonium acetate-only, putrescine-only, or unbaited traps. More female
   Mediterranean fruit flies were trapped in green traps than in colorless
   traps, and capture of male Mediterranean fruit flies was greater in
   yellow traps than in orange traps. Neither female nor male Mexican fruit
   flies differentiated among orange, green, and yellow traps, but the
   percentage trapped in any colored trap was higher than in colorless
   traps. McPhail traps with standard protein bait caught more Mexican
   fruit flies than either of the plastic traps at any of the doses of
   synthetic baits tested. However, plastic traps baited with either the
   medium or high dose of synthetic blend caught equal numbers of
   Mediterranean fruit flies as McPhail traps. Although McPhail traps
   caught more female Mediterranean fruit flies than plastic traps baited
   with the low dose of synthetic blend, a greater percentage of females
   captured in plastic traps were unmated (55-65\% versus 22\% in McPhail
   traps). Increase in dose of the synthetic lure increased the percentage
   of mated females captured in the plastic traps. Unlike McPhail traps,
   which catch large numbers of miscellaneous Diptera, the plastic traps
   were highly specific and caught few nontarget files.}},

Abstract = {{Wooden boards impregnated with sulfluramid were nailed together with
   boards treated with acetone to form a block for placement in selected
   monitoring stations of 3 colonies of the Formosan subterranean termite,
   Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, in Hallandale, FL. Under this
   choice-test condition, sulfluramid-treated boards initially accepted by
   termites were later avoided. When sulfluramid concentration was reduced,
   differences in feeding between sulfluramid-treated boards and boards
   treated with acetone only became insignificant, indicating
   nonpreferential feeding by the same population at the reduced toxicant
   concentration. Feeding deterrence was detected even for the reduced
   toxicant boards in later months for some colonies. We hypothesized an
   associative teaming by C. formosanus to avoid feeding on the treatments.
   The 12-mo baiting with sulfluramid-treated blocks reduces foraging
   populations of the treated colonies by 52-86\%. Without additional
   baiting, all populations substantially recovered in later years. It is
   suggested that lethal time (time required to kill) of a bait toxicant
   must be dose independent to be delivered to the majority of the
   population using a feeding medium.}},

   N88-91 had the lowest numbers of whiteflies, and total counts were
   significantly higher for F90-724 on trifoliolates 2, 4, and 6. Leaf
   damage ratings (\% leaf burn) ranged from 1.3\% (F90-724) to 74.0\%
   (F90-1054). Sampling ceased after 10 wks because of excessive
   whitefly-induced plant injury to most soybean entries. This study
   reflected significant differences in soybean varietal response to
   whitefly population densities and demonstrated that the greenhouse can
   be used effectively to screen soybeans for resistance to whiteflies.}},

Abstract = {{Aspects of the life history of the 2 common soft coral genera Sinularia
   and Sarcophyton were investigated on 360 individually tagged colonies
   over 3.5 yr. Measurements included rates of growth, colony fission,
   mortality, sublethal predation and algae infection, and were carried out
   at 18 sites on 6 mid- and outer-shelf reefs of the Australian Great
   Barrier Reef. In both Sinularia and Sarcophyton, average radial growth
   was around 0.5 cm yr(-1), and relative growth rates were size-dependent.
   In Sinularia, populations changed very slowly over time. Their per
   capita mortality was low (0.014 yr(-1)) and size-independent, and
   indicated longevity of the colonies. Colonies with extensions of up to
   10 x 10 m potentially could be several hundreds of years old. Mortality
   was more than compensated for by asexual reproduction through colony
   fission (0.035 yr(-1)). In Sarcophyton, mortality was low in colonies
   larger than 5 cm disk diameter (0.064 yr(-1)), and significantly higher
   in newly recruited small colonies (0.88 yr(-1)). Photographic monitoring
   of about 500 additional colonies from 16 soft coral genera showed that
   rates of mortality and recruitment in the family Alcyoniidae differed
   fundamentally from those of the commonly more `fugitive' families
   Xeniidae and Nephtheidae. Rates of recruitment by larval settlement were
   very low in a majority of the soft coral taxa. The general assumption
   that soft corals are fast-growing pioneers does not apply to the
   Alcyoniidae on the central Great Barrier Reef, where their life history
   traits indicate great persistence.}},

Abstract = {{Adult female populations of Haemagogus leucocelaenus (Dyar and Shannon),
   the sylvan vector of yellow fever, were monitored weekly during 1981-82
   by human collectors on the ground at Point Gourde in Chaguaramas Forest,
   16 km west of Port of Spain, Trinidad.
   Hg. leucocelaenus showed only diurnal landing activity, from 06.00 to
   18.00 hours (sunrise to sunset, universal time), with a single peak of
   activity between 10.00 and 14.00 hours.
   Densities of Hg, leucocelaenus during the wet season (May-November) were
   about double the level recorded during the dry season (December-April).
   Monthly parous rates averaged 53.9\% (range 25-90\%) and some females
   were up to five-pars. Retained eggs (range 2-6, mean 4/female) were
   found in the ovaries of 0.34\% of landing females, all of which had
   stage 1 ovarian follicles for the next gonotrophic cycle. Therefore
   blood-feeding is not inhibited by egg retention. Hg. leucocelaenus
   vector potential is reappraised in the light of these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, major advancements have occurred in the
   application of nucleic acid-based methods to detect and determine the
   levels of catabolic genes in environmental samples. Studies have focused
   on validating methods in microcosms, studying changes in the structure
   and expression of microbial communities in response to contaminants, and
   improving the sensitivity of the methods. Only in the last few years
   have these methods transitioned from development and validation to
   efforts to apply these methods for monitoring in situ bioremediation.
   Methods that analyse nucleic acids extracted from environmental samples
   are of value to bioremediation because they allow analysis independent
   of the artefacts that can arise from laboratory biodegradative potential
   assays and laboratory culture-based enumerations and from the inability
   to culture a large proportion of the micro-organisms in the environment.
   In theory, these methods enable a more comprehensive perspective, and a
   more defensible interpretation, of the microbial community response to
   intrinsic and engineered bioremediation processes. Results from the
   first studies applying nucleic-acid-based methods to intrinsic or
   engineered bioremediation indicate that these methods have both
   potential and limitations. The rapidly increasing number of cloned and
   sequenced catabolic genes, methodological advancements such as the
   ability to track specific micro-organisms without prior sequence data,
   and the potential use of bioaugmentation in the field suggest that the
   utility of these methods for in situ bioremediation will increase in the
   coming years.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the structure of bacterial communities and their response to
   stimuli is key to understanding community function and the interactions
   that occur between microorganisms and the environment. However,
   bacterial communities often comprise complex assemblages of large
   numbers of different bacterial populations. An approach is presented
   which allows bacterial community structure to be determined by
   fractionation of the complex mixture of total bacterial community DNA
   using the DNA-binding dye bisbenzimidazole which imposes G + C-dependent
   changes in the buoyant density of DNA. Bacterial community structure
   presented as percentage of total DNA vs. percentage G + C content of DNA
   is an indication of the relative abundance of phylogenetic groups of
   bacteria. Changes in the composition of a soil bacterial community in
   response to perturbations in the form of carbon amendment and altered
   water status were monitored.}},

Abstract = {{Macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins are widely used to
   quantify diversity in natural communities, to monitor the dispersal of
   organisms and their genes, and to trace phylogenetic relationships among
   organisms. With such widespread use of molecules as markers, it is easy
   to forget that they perform functions that are integral to the survival
   of organisms. The structural and functional properties of macromolecules
   have been intensively studied in genetics, biochemistry, and physiology.
   These fields, however, have not generally focused on the ecological
   significance of molecular variation, but instead have used defective
   variants as tools for identifying structure and function. Understanding
   the significance of molecular variation for organismal success or
   failure is a central problem in ecology, one whose solution will require
   the integration of diverse approaches and perspectives from ecology,
   molecular biology, genetics, physiology, and evolutionary biology. I
   review several studies of bacterial populations evolving in simple
   environments that have begun to integrate these approaches and
   perspectives in order to examine the consequences of molecular variation
   for ecological performance.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of total bacteria and Erwinia herbicola were monitored on
   apple blossom in selected orchards at two different geographical regions
   in New Zealand (Canterbury and Hawke's Bay). In all four orchards
   surveyed E. herbicola populations remained negligible (less than 50
   cfu/blossom) throughout flowering, increasing rapidly at petal drop to
   reach levels of 1 x 10(3) cfu/blossom (Hawke's Bay) to 1 x 10(5)
   cfu/blossom (Canterbury). Total bacterial populations increased 100-fold
   at petal drop in both locations. Pseudomonas populations were
   predominant in Canterbury throughout all flowering stages and in Hawke's
   Bay after early flowering. When screened for inhibitory activity to E,
   amylovora, 26\% of all isolates from Canterbury showed some inhibition
   in vitro, but none of the isolates from Hawke's Bay showed inhibition of
   E. amylovora in vitro. Two Canterbury isolates with strong in vitro
   inhibitory activity also inhibited E. amylovora in immature pear fruit.
   One isolate was identified as E, herbicola and one isolate as
   Pseudomonas fluorescens.}},

Abstract = {{The relocation of unionacean mussels is commonly used as a conservation
   and management tool in large rivers and streams. Relocation has been
   used to recolonize areas where mussel populations have been eliminated
   by prior pollution events, to remove mussels from construction zones and
   to re-establish populations of endangered species. More recently,
   relocation has been used to protect native freshwater mussels from
   colonization by the exotic zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. We
   conducted a literature review of mussel relocations and evaluated their
   relative success as a conservation and management strategy. We found
   that 43\% of all relocations were conducted because of construction
   projects that were forced to comply with the Endangered Species Act 1973
   and that only 16\% were monitored for five or more consecutive years.
   Most (43\%) relocation projects were conducted from July to September,
   presumably a period when reproductive stress is relatively low for most
   species and the metabolic rate is sufficient for reburrowing in the
   substrate. The mortality of relocated mussels was unreported in 27\% of
   projects; reported mortality varied widely among projects and species
   and was difficult to assess. The mean mortality of relocated mussels was
   49\% based on an average recovery rate of 43\%. There is little guidance
   on the methods for relocation or for monitoring the subsequent long-term
   status of relocated mussels. Based on this evaluation, research is
   needed to develop criteria for selecting a suitable relocation site and
   to establish appropriate methods and guidelines for conducting
   relocation projects.}},

Abstract = {{Seeds of Viola arvensis collected in different years and in different
   months within those years were buried in soil under natural seasonal
   temperature cycles, and changes in their germination requirements
   monitored. Seeds were dormant at maturity in May or June, but nondormant
   by autumn. During winter, some seeds entered dormancy, while others
   entered conditional dormancy, i.e. retained the ability to germinate at
   15/6 and 20/10 degrees C but not at other thermoperiods. Dormant and
   conditionally dormant seeds became nondormant the following summer.
   Seeds collected in 1981 exhibited an annual dormancy:nondormancy cycle,
   while those collected in 1982 exhibited an annual conditional
   dormancy:nondormancy cycle. The type of dormancy cycle found in these
   seed lots during their first year of burial persisted in subsequent
   years. Thirty-five and 36\% of seeds collected in May 1983 and 1986,
   respectively, were conditionally dormant the following May, while only 5
   and 9\% of those collected in the same field in June 1983 and 1986,
   respectively, were conditionally dormant. Dormant seeds collected in
   1981, 1982 and 1984 and buried at 5 degrees C during summer germinated
   to 0, 33 and 0\% respectively, at 15/6 degrees C in autumn. After the
   1982 seeds became nondormant during summer, only 25\% entered
   conditional dormancy when buried at 5 degrees C, but after the 1981 and
   1984 seeds became nondormant, 100\% entered conditional dormancy at 5
   degrees C. Thus, the persistent seed bank of V. arvensis at a population
   site may consist of seeds with an annual dormancy:nondormancy cycle and
   others with an annual conditional dormancy:nondormancy cycle. This is
   the first report of the two types of annual seed dormancy cycles in the
   same species.}},

Abstract = {{The success of eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris)
   restoration programs in the Midwest has led to dramatic increases in
   occupied range. Habitats with limited forest land, once thought
   unsuitable for wild turkey, now support densities that exceed 30
   birds/km(2) of timber. Turkey population growth has resulted in the
   liberalization of harvest regulations with corresponding increases in
   hunter numbers and turkey harvest. As pressures on the wild turkey
   resource escalate, so does the need for an enhanced understanding of
   population dynamics.
   We used radiotelemetry to investigate survival and reproduction of wild
   turkey hens from 1980 to 1989 in the mixed timber-agricultural region of
   north-central Missouri. We also used direct recovery rates of banded
   gobblers to examine spring harvest mortality. Radio-marked hens (n =
   327) were monitored annually, greater than or equal to 5 times/week, to
   derive estimates of cause-specific mortality, seasonal survival, and
   reproductive parameters. Band numbers from tagged gobblers (n = 134)
   were recorded at mandatory turkey check stations to estimate harvest
   mortality.
   Seasonal survival rates of hens were variable, with winter rates
   exhibiting the greatest range (0.625-1.00). Although daily survival
   rates did not differ among seasons (P = 0.142) according to analysis of
   variance, a model selection procedure indicated that seasons could not
   be combined. Cause-specific mortality varied among seasons within years,
   with predation being the major cause of mortality. Legal fall-harvest
   mortality averaged 4.4\% of radio-marked hens. Illegal kill of hens
   during the spring gobbler season ranged from 0.0 to 30.0\% and averaged
   5.2\%, exceeding legal fall harvest of hens in some years. During the
   first year after banding, 11.2\% of adult gobblers were harvested during
   spring hunting season.
   The nesting rate (measured as the proportion of hens attempting to nest)
   was consistent and high (greater than or equal to 0.9) across years;
   however, hen success and nest success showed significant annual
   variation. Hen success differed between adult and subadult hens as did
   the success of first nests. We observed no difference in the success of
   renests between age classes of hens. Most poult mortality occurred by
   2-weeks posthatch; however, annual estimates varied among years. Poult
   mortality at 4-weeks posthatch ranged from 0.419 to 0.705. Across years,
   increasing poult mortality was associated (p = 0.75, P = 0.054) with the
   number of days in June that rainfall exceeded 2.54 cm.
   We used a stochastic population model to examine the effects of
   simulated spring harvest on the age structure of males and the effects
   of fall harvest on population growth. Increasing levels of spring
   harvest resulted in a decreasing proportion of adult males in the spring
   population and in the harvest. At a 5\% level of fall harvest,
   population size at year 40 increased in 72\% of the simulations. When a
   10\% level of fall harvest was modeled, population size at year 40
   decreased in all simulations. The model was sensitive to changes in hen
   survival, nest success, and poult mortality. Simulations were run for 40
   years with an initial population size of 5,820. Decreases in poult
   mortality of 10 and 20\% resulted in increases in average simulated
   population size at year 40 of 3,154 and 19,957\% (32.54 and 200.57
   fold), respectively. The variation we observed in wild turkey survival
   and reproduction and our population model outputs suggest that harvest
   strategies can affect population growth and age structure. Fall harvests
   have the greatest potential to affect population growth. We recommend
   that state-level estimates of harvest, hunting pressure, reproduction,
   and survival form the basis for developing and evaluating wild turkey
   harvest strategies in the Midwest. A conservative approach to spring and
   fall harvest regulations is recommended if sufficient data to model
   populations are not available.}},

Abstract = {{Remote high elevation sites are thought to be good sites to monitor
   global change and anthropogenic effects on ecosystems. This study was
   conducted during 1987-1990 in a high elevation wetland (3593 m) located
   in the Green Lakes Valley, Front Range, Colorado (USA). Salix spp. was
   the dominant riparian species in this 2 ha. wetland. Small shallow pools
   (<0.5 m depth) constituted a water area of 236 m(3). The major source of
   water during the study period was snowmelt. The wetland had a well
   defined outlet and inlet, although an undetermined amount of water
   entered as groundwater from the snow patch above. Outlet discharge was
   424-460 m(3) during the month of July and declined thereafter as water
   input from the snowpatch declined. Inlet discharge was 67\% of outlet
   discharge. Water temperatures in the outlet were always less than 6.8
   degrees C, pH 6.0-6.3, and mean conductivity 30.8 mu S cm(-1). Both NO3-
   and SO4-2 were higher in the inlet than in the outlet. Dominant cations
   in the inlet and outlet waters 4 were Ca+2 much greater than Mg+2 > K- >
   Na-; dominant anions were SO4-2 much greater than HCO3- > NO3- much
   greater than Cl-. Nutrient limitation 4 by P was demonstrated once using
   nutrient diffusing substrata. No limitation could be shown for NO3-,
   HCO3-, or Fe+EDTA. Slow colonization rates of periphyton on tiles were
   attributed to low temperatures and/or ultraviolet radiation. However,
   interannual differences in biomass on tiles were as much as 300\% after
   35 days. A minimum of 16-54 samples would be needed to detect a
   significant interannual change in biomass on tiles after 35 days
   assuming that the extreme case for periphyton patchiness. Global climate
   change is likely to affect discharge and water temperature in this
   wetland which will have direct and indirect affects on population
   dynamics and ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{Field surveys of egg populations of Cryptophlebia leucotreta (Meyrick),
   C. batrochopa (Meyrick) and their egg parasitoid Trichogrammntoidea
   cryptophlebiae Nagaraj were undertaken on macadamia trees at four
   orchard sites in Malawi. At three sites, significantly more
   Cryptophlebia eggs were laid on nuts at the bottom of the canopy. There
   was a decrease in the number of eggs with increasing height in the tree
   at all sites. Differences between the number of eggs at the middle and
   top of the trees were not significant at two sites. Differences in the
   level of oviposition at the centre and periphery of the canopy were also
   not significant. Although all sites showed a slight increase in
   percentage parasitism of Cryptophlebia eggs by T. cryptophlebiae with
   height in the tree, none of these increases was statistically
   significant. At two sites, there was a decrease in the number of viable
   and dead Cryptophlebia eggs with increasing height. The differences in
   the number of live, hatched and dead eggs at the centre and periphery of
   the canopy were not significant. A higher percentage parasitism did not
   cause reductions in the number of borer-damaged nuts, and there was a
   weak negative correlation between the percentage of mature nuts and the
   percentage of borer damage at all of the sites. These findings suggest
   that monitoring for pest management decisions should be concentrated at
   the bottom of the tree canopy.}},

Abstract = {{This study was aimed to determine whether thermoregulation by juvenile
   garter snakes is affected by developmental temperature imposed by their
   mothers during pregnancy. Maternal temperature treatments were created
   by maintaining six groups of females at six different constant
   temperatures (24-32 degrees C) during pregnancy. A seventh group of
   females was allowed to thermoregulate during pregnancy. The body
   temperatures of juveniles (N=324) on thermal gradients were monitored in
   the morning and afternoon for 5 consecutive days, beginning 5 days after
   birth. The body temperatures of juveniles were consistent, apparently
   heritable and remarkably stereotyped. Juvenile body temperature was
   virtually unaffected by maternal temperature treatment. (C) 1995 The

Abstract = {{There are three main methods used in the study of feeding behaviour and
   food consumption in captive populations of fish. These are direct
   observation, the recording of feeding activity using `on-demand'
   feeders, and the quantitative determination of gastrointestinal content
   using a non-invasive `labelled feed' technique. Observational techniques
   have been widely used in studies of foraging behaviour and feeding
   responses, but these methods are usually confined to the study of fish
   held in small groups. `Labelled feed' techniques are well suited to the
   monitoring of feed intake of individual fish held in large groups, but
   cannot be used for the continuous monitoring of feeding behaviour. They
   are, therefore, not particularly suitable for the collection of
   information about short-term changes in feeding rhythms, or possible
   die1 changes in feeding activity. Studies of feeding activity may best
   be carried out using computer-operated `on-demand' feeding systems, but
   the data collected using these systems give no information about
   individual feed consumption. Examples are presented showing how data
   collected using the three methods can be used to provide insights into
   how various abiotic and biotic factors influence fish feeding.}},

Abstract = {{During a long-term study of the amphibian fauna on an artificial island
   near Vienna (Austria), one isolated site was completely encircled with a
   permanent drift fence and pitfall traps. Eleven amphibian species
   occurred at the study site. For the Common Spadefoot Toad (Pelobates
   fuscus) and for the Danube Crested Newt (Triturus dobrogicus)
   individuals could be recognized by photographing the highly variable
   dorsal/ventral patterns. Daily patrols of the drift fence, for 6 years
   since 1986, enabled us to monitor the demography and dynamics of these
   two species. For T. dobrogicus, the adult part of the censused
   population decreased from 207 to 87 individuals during the first 2 years
   of investigation and then remained stable. Pelobates fuscus showed a
   constant decrease over 6 years, from 626 to 62 individuals. Juveniles
   were produced annually; a massive increase in this age class was
   observed for both species during the period of investigation. Triturus
   dobrogicus showed higher adult survival than P. fuscus. The constancy of
   several population parameters of both species may reflect the stability
   of the cultured parkland habitat in which the study site is located.}},

Abstract = {{Fungus gnats, Bradysia coprophila, damage plant roots and are involved
   in transmitting serious plant pathogens. The entomopathogenic nematode
   Steinernema feltiae (SN) significantly reduced numbers of fungus gnat
   larvae in potting medium in greenhouse-grown poinsettias, Euphorbia
   pulcherrima, in comparison with Steinernema carpocapsae (All), the
   bacterial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis, and the
   insect growth regulator kinoprene. Levels of insect control were
   indistinguishable between Steinernema feltiae (SN) and the
   organophosphate insecticide diazinon, suggesting that the use of S.
   feltiae (SN) may be both a biorational and an economical alternative to
   conventional chemical control. In a petri dish bioassay, second- and
   fourth-instar fungus gnats were significantly more susceptible than
   pupae to infection by S. feltiae (SN). However, pupae mere susceptible
   to some level of nematode infection not only by S. feltiae (SN), but
   also by S. feltiae (UK), S. carpocapsae (All), and Heterorhabditis
   bacteriophora (NC). Potato discs placed on the potting medium proved to
   be a reliable method of monitoring fungus gnat populations in comparison

Abstract = {{Field studies of orientation responses of the IIS-10.11 sibling of
   Simulium arcticum Malloch species complex and other simuliid species to
   host-mimicking cattle silhouette traps (CSTs) were carried out in the
   Athabasca region of Alberta, Canada. Simuliids were attracted to CSTs
   from downwind by a CO, bait but very few were attracted to an unbaited
   CST. Passively searching simuliids tended to fly at lower levels than
   actively host seeking ones. Simuliids appeared to fly at lower levels
   when within visual range of the CST than when outside of it. Higher
   flight levels may improve chances of eventually making visual contact
   with the host or CST. Experiments in which a CO, outlet was separated by
   increasing distances from a CST indicated that simuliids see the 1.1 m
   long CST at a range of approximately 8 m. Simuliids landing on the CST,
   whether CO2-baited or not, showed a strong preference for the trap's
   ends followed by the downwind side, followed by the upwind side. Species
   composition of collections from CST collections differed significantly
   from the species composition of cattle sweeps taken at the same times.
   Simulium vittatum was over-represented in collector catches in
   comparison to cattle sweeps. This bias may be due to species-specific
   differences in responses after landing on the CST since sweeps taken
   around CSTs had compositions similar to cattle sweeps. Results are
   discussed in terms of host orientation in biting flies in general and
   the suitability of CST-type traps as components of attractant-based
   control strategies and in simuliid population monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy oil pollution has been found in sea water and coastal environments
   not only near industrial petroleum districts and places of oil spillage
   but also in other places where crude oil and/or refined products can be
   carried to by winds, streams, etc.
   Marine oil pollution may not only affect productivity and quality of
   marine organisms but may ultimately affect the health of the human
   population as there is a possible health risk from consumption of sea
   food contaminated by oil-derived carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs). In the marine habitat, many organisms readily
   accumulate n-alkanes and PAHs from the environment and store them at a
   relatively high level in their tissues (Murray et al. 1991; Singh et al.
   1992), and studies have been carried out on the accumulation and
   depuration of toxic organic pollutants in marine organisms (Murray et
   al. 1991; Narbonne ef al. 1992; Ogata and Fujisawa 1985).
   As a part of a continuous monitoring program of the foods imported to
   the Canary Islands (Galindo et al. 1986, Brito at al. 1990) this paper
   presents the results obtained in the determination of n-alkanes and PAHs
   in fresh-frozen and precooked-frozen mussels, Perna canaliculus,
   commercialized in these islands.}},

Abstract = {{The beetle fauna of conventional, organic, and abandoned apple orchards
   was monitored in the Annapolis Valley, Nova Scotia, between May and
   September 1991. Treatment in the three types of orchards differed with
   respect to weed control, disease control, fertilization, and general
   care. The most commonly captured beetles in all three types of orchards
   were carabids, in particular, Carabus nemoralis Muller, Carabus
   granulatus Linne, Harpalus rufipes (DeGeer), and Pterostichus coracinus
   (Newman). In general, abundance of predaceous beetles was highest in the
   conventional orchards and lowest in the abandoned orchards. Generic
   composition of predaceous beetles was similar among orchards, although
   the abandoned orchards were characterized by high proportions of the
   larger carabids, C. nemoralis and C. granulatus, whereas the organic and
   conventional orchards were dominated by the smaller carabids, H. rufipes
   and P. coracinus. Although there were no significant differences among
   orchard type in the total abundance of non-predaceous beetles, the
   abandoned orchards displayed the greatest diversity of non-predaceous
   beetles, with the lowest diversity found in the organic orchards.}},

Abstract = {{Settlement and growth of age 0+ cod were monitored using snorkel and
   self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) in four distinct
   habitat types (sand, seagrass, cobble, and rock reef) in St. Margaret's
   Bay, Nova Scotia. Newly settled cod were marked with acrylic dye,
   allowing repeated visual length estimates of individual fish. Settlement
   of cod did not differ between habitat types, but postsettlement survival
   and subsequent juvenile densities were higher in more structurally
   complex habitats. These differences appear to be due to increased
   shelter availability and decreased predator efficiency in structurally
   complex habitats. Growth rate was highest in seagrass beds, while the
   efficiency of cod predators was lowest and cod survival was highest on
   rocky reefs and cobble bottoms. Thus, trade-offs occur between energy
   gain and predation risk. In St. Margaret's Bay, the population structure
   of Atlantic cod may be less influenced by patterns of larval supply than
   by postsettlement processes such as habitat-specific growth and
   mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Increased use of fishing gear in the marine environment can be
   detrimental to animals such as cetaceans, particularly through
   entanglement. Examination of the impact of such mortality on two
   substocks of the western North Atlantic humpback whale, Megaptera
   novaeangliae, indicates that when entanglement losses are added to
   natural mortality estimates and subtracted from birth rate estimates,
   annual mortality may be as high as 5.4\% in the Newfoundland and
   Labrador population and 4.8\% in the Gulf of Maine population. More
   effective entanglement reporting and assisting systems are needed in the
   Gulf of Maine and increased efforts are needed to decrease
   entanglements, entanglement mortalities, and damages to fishing gear. We
   conclude that monitoring of the size of humpback populations needs to
   continue, given their particular vulnerability to coastal fishing and
   the potential impacts of entanglement mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Zebra Finches Taeniopygia guttata are renowned for breeding
   opportunistically in arid Australia and for their ability to nest
   immediately in response to rain at any time of year. However, this
   conclusion has rested on short-term and incidental observations. We
   monitored breeding of Zebra Finches at Alice Springs, central Australia,
   over a seven-year period by estimating the month of hatching of
   free-flying subadults caught at a walk-in trap. Capture-mark-recapture
   analysis suggested that the monitored population was open and highly
   mobile and exploited a large home range. Despite gaps in the sampling a
   multiple regression analysis found a significant statistical
   relationship between breeding and the incidence of rainfall. When
   conditions were favourable in a given year Zebra Finches had a very long
   reproductive period with 10.6 equally good consecutive months for
   breeding. Breeding was possible in every month of the year but was least
   in April and greatest in October. Low winter temperatures did not
   prevent breeding. The heavier the rainfall, the more intense and the
   longer the breeding episode. Once a breeding episode began, surges of
   breeding activity corresponded with follow-up rains. We did not observe
   the immediate response to rainfall described by earlier authors. On the
   contrary, the statistical analysis revealed that rain had a negative
   effect on breeding in the month in which it fell, and in the following
   month. There was a lag between the onset of the first rains and the
   onset of breeding, ranging from one to two months in summer to two to
   three months in winter. The statistical analysis revealed that rain four
   months previously had the most profound positive effect on breeding.
   Hatching of the first clutches coincided with the first availability of
   ripening grass seeds. The artificial supply of abundant dry seed, on its
   own, did not stimulate breeding. The timing of seed set by grasses in
   central Australia is complex, depending on the species composition, the
   prevailing temperatures immediately after rain, and the amount and
   timing of previous falls of rain. We suggest that Zebra Finches track
   these factors and breed opportunistically as soon as new supplies of
   seed are available.}},

   towards conservation and machalilla national park, Ecuador}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{Economic and social problems facing many developing countries jeopardize
   the effectiveness and very existence of their national parks and
   protected areas. Rural poverty exacerbates the need for access to
   natural resources in protected areas and increases public conflict with
   protected-area management. A prerequisite for the long-term
   sustainability of parks and protected areas is public involvement and
   support for the conservation of natural resources.
   Towards the above ends, the present study analyses local residents'
   attitudes, knowledge, and concept of values concerning conservation and
   the management of natural resources in Machalilla National Park,
   Ecuador. A survey was administered of 90 households in three villages
   located within the Park boundaries and two villages adjacent to the
   Park. Survey results indicated that local residents living either within
   or adjacent to Machalilla National Park hold a variety of negative
   attitudes towards the Park. Positive attitudes tended to increase with
   respondents' level of education (X(2) = 19.001, df = 2, p < 0.0001) and
   knowledge about conservation issues (X(2) = 26.616, df = 1, p < 0.0001).
   Younger residents (X(2) = 12.960, df = 2, p 0.002), respondents
   perceiving benefits from the Park (X(2) = 14.292, df = 2, p = 0.001),
   and respondents reporting good relations with the Park staff (X(2) =
   5.514, df = 1, p = 0.019), were more positive towards the Park. Factors
   influencing public attitudes are compared with study results in other
   countries.
   Negative attitudes stemmed from (1) a lack of public participation in
   the Park's creation and a misunderstanding of the National Park concept,
   (2) perceived restrictions on resource-use outweighing perceived
   benefits from the Park, and (3) conflicts between local inhabitants and
   the Park staff. Attitudes towards Machalilla National Park do not differ
   markedly between people living within or adjacent to the Park (F = 1.04,
   p = 0.8741).
   The results indicate management policies that would be needed to improve
   incorporation of the human populations into long-term strategies for
   sustaining the Park. A multifaceted approach, incorporating community
   involvement, environmental education, the development of feasible
   economic alternatives, and long-term social as well as ecological
   monitoring, is needed to attain also the goal of conserving biological
   diversity. The survey provided meaningful information for administrative
   decision-making and will provide data for monitoring the efficacy of
   subsequent policies.}},

Abstract = {{`'Resistance management'' tactics have been much discussed, but such
   tactics have provided surprisingly limited practical results for pest
   management programs to date. We have learned a great deal about
   pesticide resistance mechanisms, the mode of inheritance of resistances,
   the molecular basis of resistance and cross resistance mechanisms, and
   how to evaluate the impact of resistance on fitness. However, it remains
   difficult to `'manage'' resistance once resistant individuals make up
   more than 5 to 10\% of the population. Generally, the best that can be
   achieved is to delay the development of high levels of resistance for a
   few years, most often by using the product less often.
   A more effective resistance management strategy will combine a variety
   of effective pest management tactics along with a reduction in numbers
   and rates of pesticides applied. Effective pest management tactics
   include monitoring, evaluating economic injury levels so that pesticides
   are applied only when needed, biological control, host plant resistance,
   cultural controls, biorational pest controls, and genetic control
   methods. As a part of this multi-tactic strategy, it is crucial to
   evaluate the impact of pesticides on natural enemies. Sometimes,
   pesticide-resistant natural enemies can be effective components of a
   program to delay the development of resistance in pest arthropods.}},

Abstract = {{Permanent sample plot (PSP) studies play a major role in ecological and
   management research. Bias and error may arise in such studies at each
   stage of the assessment procedure from plot establishment through to
   data interpretation, and can undermine confidence in the use of PSP
   data. This paper considers these problems and suggests how they might be
   identified and minimised. Examples are taken from Budongo Forest,
   Uganda, which provides some of the world's longest-term PSP data from
   both primary and treated tropical forest (1939-1993 and 1933-1992
   respectively).
   Three distinct types of artefact in PSP studies are recognised: errors
   in methodology, impact of methodology, and inappropriate analysis.
   Deficiencies in each aspect of plot evaluation can have considerable
   influence on the evaluation of change with time and of differences
   between sites. Each technique can be controlled and/or improved. Data
   correction and `harmonisation' procedures are discussed. Interpretation
   of PSP data must consider the many pitfalls of assessing such complex
   data. Some of the central considerations in data interpretation are
   reviewed and critical areas are defined e.g. time period between
   observations influences the evaluation of dynamic quantities. Some
   conclusions disagree with those of other authors. The most significant
   factors identified (many with implications for vegetation monitoring
   generally) are summarised and a set of recommendations is provided.}},

Abstract = {{In a controlled crossing experiment on Lychnis flos-cuculi plants in the
   greenhouse, outbred and selfed maternal plants were each treated with
   pollen from unrelated plants, siblings and selves. The seeds thus
   obtained had expected inbreeding coefficients of 0, 0.25 and 0.5 for the
   outbred maternal plants, and 0, 0.5 and 0.75 for the selfed maternal
   plants. Seed abortion rate, seed weight and germination rate were
   estimated. Seedlings were transplanted to an outdoor garden, and
   monitored for survival, probability of flowering, number of capsules and
   area of capsules next spring. Inbred seeds germinated slower and in
   lower proportions than those less inbred, and seedlings had lower
   survival, flowering, fruit set and area of capsules if inbred.
   Combined fitness values were estimated from the survival and fecundity
   components, and severe inbreeding depression was detected for these
   estimates (0.51 and 0.56 for one generation of selfing). The fitness
   function decreased linearly with the increase in inbreeding coefficient,
   which is as expected if the inbreeding depression is additive among
   loci.}},

Abstract = {{These studies were done to determine the prevalence of infection, over
   time, of progeny from a population of 1988 year class brook trout,
   Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill), that was asymptomatically infected
   with Renibacterium salmoninarum, the causative agent of bacterial kidney
   disease. This population and its progeny from the 1991 and 1992
   spawnings were monitored for approximately 3 years for prevalence of R.
   salmoninarum and development of bacterial kidney disease. Ovarian fluid
   samples from the 1991 and 1992 spawnings, and from a 1993 spawning of
   the 1991 progeny, were analysed for R. salmoninarum by enzyme linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the membrane filtration fluorescent
   antibody technique. Kidney and spleen tissues of the 1988 year class
   were assayed by ELISA following the 1992 spawning. The progeny of the
   1991 and 1992 spawnings were followed for increased prevalence of R.
   salmoninarum by the ELISA. Kidney tissues were assayed and sampling
   began once the fish were large enough. Each population of progeny was
   sampled quarterly for one year. Overall, the progeny displayed
   decreasing prevalence of R. salmoninarum and all ovarian fluids of the
   1991 progeny (in 1993) were negative. Brood fish and progeny remained
   asymptomatic during the course of the study.}},

Abstract = {{A population of white-throated savanna monitor lizards (Varanus
   albigularis) in Etosha National Park, Namibia, was studied for 17
   months. A total of 238 lizards was examined, of which 31 were
   radiotagged for periods up to 14 months. The hot/wet season
   (January-April) home ranges determined from radiotelemetry data were
   large and differed significantly between adult males (18.3 +/- 2.4
   km(2)) and females (6.1 +/- 0.6 km(2)). During the cool/dry season
   (May-August) males and females utilized less than 10\% of their wet
   season home range, except during the mating period (July-August), when
   males moved extensively while locating estrous females. When
   supplemental food was made available during the cool/dry season, male
   lizards increased their daily movements over 30-fold, suggesting that
   food, not seasonal differences in ambient temperature, limits activity.
   The largest adult lizards were males; however, there was no difference
   in wet season mass between males and females of similar snout-vent
   length. The apparent sex ratio varied dramatically by season, but this
   was a result of the different activity patterns between the sexes.
   Overall, the data suggest parity between the sexes. The biomass of V.
   albigularis at least rivaled that of any sympatric medium and
   large-sized mammalian carnivore species in the park.}},

Abstract = {{Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is an Asian mosquito that recently has
   colonized North America via used tire transport. Temperate Ae.
   albopictus populations overwinter as diapausing eggs, but tropical
   populations cannot diapause. Eggs of tropical (SABAH) and temperate
   (INDY) Ae. albopictus were obtained in diapause-inducing conditions and
   placed inside a scrap tire to monitor overwintering survival in northern
   Indiana during the winters of 1989-1990 and 1990-1991. Diapause eggs of
   Ae. triseriatus (Say), a native North American mosquito, were included
   for comparison. Tropical Ae. albopictus from Malaysia did not survive
   either winter. Temperate Ae. albopictus from Indianapolis, IN, did not
   survive the winter of 1989-1990, but 78\% survived the winter of
   1990-1991. In contrast, 92 and 96\% of Ae. triseriatus survived the
   winters of 1989-1990 and 1990-1991, respectively. Neither mean
   temperature nor absolute minimum temperature (a winter's lowest
   temperature) accurately predicted Ae. albopictus overwintering
   survivorship in the field. The possible effect of snow and other
   insulating materials on the overwintering survivorship of Ae. albopictus
   eggs is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{During the austral spring of 1990, rotation of the Antarctic polar
   vortex resulted in a 2-fold change in ozone concentrations (170-380
   Dobson units) over regions of the marginal ice zone of the
   Bellingshausen Sea. The changes in ozone caused significant variations
   in incident and in-water UVB fluences. Phytoplankton cell densities,
   nutrient concentrations, DNA concentrations and stable carbon isotope
   ratios (delta(13)C) of particulate organic and dissolved inorganic
   carbon were monitored for a 5-week period during the ozone fluctuations.
   Phaeocystis was the dominant phytoplankton taxon and cell numbers were
   positively correlated to ozone and the delta(13)C of seawater Sigma CO2,
   and negatively correlated to nutrient concentrations. The densities of
   co-occurring diatoms were not related to changes in ozone, delta(13)C or
   nutrients. These observations suggest that Phaeocystis sp. responds very
   rapidly and adversely to increased UVB exposure, and that seawater
   delta(13)C data may be a useful tool for assessing the physiological
   state of high-latitude marine communities relative to increased UVB
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{From 1984 through 1988, I studied Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni)
   ecology during the breeding season on the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site
   (PCMS) in southeast Colorado. The number of nesting attempts located and
   monitored annually ranged from four in 1984, to 22 in 1987. Nests used
   by Swainson's hawks were located predominantly in one-seed juniper
   (Juniperus monosperma) or cottonwood (Populus spp.) trees. Traditional
   nesting success estimates averaged 0.64 and ranged from 0.42 in 1985 to
   1.00 in 1984. Mayfield estimates of nesting success ranged from 0.27
   (1988) to 1.00 (1984). Based on prey remains collected at nest sites,
   food deliveries to nestlings consisted primarily of small birds (50\%)
   and mammals (45\%), and diet breadth over the 5-yr study period was
   high. Minimum-convex-polygon home-range size of radio-marked adults
   during the late-nestling and post-fledging period averaged 21.2 km(2) in
   1985 and 27.3 km(2) in 1986, with males exhibiting larger home ranges
   than females (P = 0.15) across years. Compared with other breeding
   Swainson's hawk populations, breeding area reoccupancy among years on
   the PCMS was moderately high, home ranges during the late-nestling and
   post-fledging periods were large, and ground-nesting birds were
   important in the breeding-season diet.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of heterotrophic dinoflagellates, phytoplankton and ciliates
   were monitored daily during summer 1994 in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan.
   The growth rates of heterotrophic dinoflagellates in screened seawater
   (<50 mu m) were also measured. During the survey period, a Gymnodinium
   mikimotoi red tide occurred, continued for 1 wk and disappeared.
   Following the outbreak of the red tide, abundance and growth rates of
   heterotrophic dinoflagellates (mainly composed of Gyrodinium dominans
   and Gyrodinium spirale) increased rapidly. Calculations of the impact of
   grazing by the heterotrophic dinoflagellates on the G. mikimotoi red
   tide strongly suggest that they played an important role in the
   disappearance of the red tide. On the other hand, the ciliate population
   (mainly composed of oligotrichs of ca 45 mu m) did not respond to the
   red tide but covaried with the population of small (2 to 8 mu m)
   flagellates, suggesting that ciliates are not direct competitors of
   heterotrophic dinoflagellates in this region.}},

Abstract = {{The timing of foliar and sexual development of Phyllocladus
   aspleniifolius (Gymnospermae: Podocarpaceae) were recorded at Mt Field
   in Tasmania. Seed fall, germination, and survival were monitored in
   different regions of Tasmania. The timing of pollen release and cone
   development in P. aspleniifolius indicates that gene-flow between
   populations is possible and may provide the genetic diversity to support
   the wide altitudinal range of this species. P. aspleniifolius produced
   variable amounts of seed between the sites and between years.
   Germination and survival were not favoured by substrate disturbance. The
   number of germinants two springs after seed fall reflected the variation
   in annual seed production and suggests that pulses in regeneration are
   likely although soil-stored seed and immigrant seed may offset this
   effect.}},

   low numbers for the following 3 years (Reid et al. 1995). Lemming
   numbers often declined throughout the summer in spite of continuous
   reproduction, and population recovery occurred overwinter. Heavy
   predation losses of radio-collared lemmings occurred each summer and
   this lemming population may be trapped in a predator-pit. Collared
   lemmings breed in winter and only because of winter population growth do
   these populations persist. Tundra vole numbers increased rapidly in most
   summers but usually declined overwinter. Tundra voles do not seem able
   to sustain winter reproduction in this extreme environment and this
   prevents them from reaching high density because of the short summer.
   Population growth in both these rodents could be prevented by poor food
   or by predation losses, and landscape patchiness may also help to
   prevent population growth. For lemmings we do not think that a shortage
   of shelter or intrinsic limitations could be restricting population
   increase at Pearce Point. This is the first detailed study of a
   non-cyclic collared lemming population.}},

Abstract = {{Although adaptationist hypotheses predict a functional relationship
   between mating systems and sexual size dimorphism, such predictions are
   difficult to test because of the high degree of phylogenetic
   conservatism in both of these traits. Taxa that show intraspecific
   variation in mating systems hence offer valuable opportunities for more
   direct tests of evolutionary-ecological hypotheses. Based on a collation
   of published and unpublished records, we document intraspecific
   geographic variation in mating systems (presence versus absence of
   male-male combat) within the widely-distributed Australian python
   Morelia spilota. Radiotelemetric monitoring of 19 free-ranging pythons
   in a population in north-eastern New South Wales showed that these
   animals display a mating system of female defence polygyny. Previous
   studies on a southern population of the same species found that males
   engaged in long mate-searching movements, showed no overt agonistic
   behavior, and formed long-term (>2 months) aggregations around
   reproductive females. In strong contrast, our adult male carpet pythons
   (i) moved about relatively little (mean displacement <11 m/day) during
   the mating season, (ii) remained with females only briefly (<5 days),
   and (iii) engaged in male-male combat in the vicinity of females. This
   male-male combat included vigorous biting as well as ritualised
   `'wrestling'' matches, resulting in a high incidence of bite scars in
   adult males. In keeping with predictions from sexual selection theory,
   males attain larger body sizes than females in this population, whereas
   females grow larger than males in the previously-studied southern
   population where males do not engage in physical combat for mating
   opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the relationship between resistance genes and
   hydrolytic enzyme induction, the interaction between two Phaseolus
   vulgaris cultivars (Sierra and Olathe) and two Uromyces appendiculatus
   races (47 and 55) were analyzed. Resistance of Sierra to race 55 was
   expressed as hypersensitive flecking, whereas the resistance of Olathe
   to race 47 was not associated with macroscopic symptoms and was classed
   as immunity. The Sierra/race 47 and Olathe/race 55 interactions were
   compatible. An analysis of a F-2 population and F-3 families
   demonstrated that a monogenic factor controlled resistance to race 47
   while two genes controlled the interaction with race 55. At one locus
   determining resistance to race 58 resistance is dominant to
   susceptibility, and al the second locus hypersensitive resistance is
   dominant to immunity. Both alleles at the second locus are hypostatic to
   the susceptibility allele at the first locus. The induction of the
   hydrolytic enzymes beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase was monitored for
   the four interactions over a ten-day period. For the compatible
   interactions, the hydrolytic enzyme activities increased slightly over
   time. This pattern was also noted for the Olathe/race 55
   immune-resistance interaction. In contrast, the beta-1,3-glucanase and
   chitinase activity for the Sierra/race 55 hypersensitive-resistance
   interaction was significantly greater from day 2 through day 10. These
   results suggest the possibility that induction of hydrolytic enzyme
   activity may be associated with hypersensitive, but not immune
   resistance in the bean/bean rust interaction. (C) 1995 Academic Press

Abstract = {{In South Africa, at the periphery of its distribution, the saddlebilled
   stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis has been most abundant in areas
   where human activity has been limited by factors such as disease or
   conservation protectionism, e.g. the Kruger National Park (KNP). This is
   perhaps the primary reason for the unchanged distribution of the
   saddlebilled stork in South Africa. A statistical power analysis is
   carried out to determine whether the current survey methods conducted in
   the KNP, which count storks incidentally, are sufficient to detect
   trends in population size. The surveys are unable to detect assumed
   trends and, in order to do so, marked improvements will have to take
   place. Two other methods have been used to count the KNP saddlebilled
   stork population, (i) a specific saddlebilled stork aerial survey and
   (ii) a modified capture-recapture technique based on individual
   photographic recognition. Both of these have greater power to detect
   trends in population size than those presently undertaken by the park
   authorities. Of these two methods, the latter has a greater ability to
   detect decreasing population trends. However, because of logistic and
   temporal constraints which will negatively affect technique precision, a
   specific saddlebilled stork aerial survey is proposed as the method most
   able to monitor population trends. However, a combination of aerial and
   photographic estimation techniques will also yield demographic data,
   which are as yet unavailable.}},

   in field populations of the tobacco budworm (TBW), Heliothis virescens

   resistance from 1991 to 1994 was similar each year in that resistance
   increased midseason and declined in late season. Resistance gene
   frequencies were highest in 1992. A vial test was successfully used to

Abstract = {{Corn earworm, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), pheromone trap capture, larval
   infestation and adult emergence was monitored in corn in the Lower Rio
   Grande Valley (26.2 degrees N, 98.0 degrees W), Uvalde (29,2 degrees N,
   99.7 degrees W), and Lubbock (33.5 degrees N, 101.8 degrees W), Texas.
   On a regional scale, larval infestation of fruiting corn and emergence
   from pupae excavated from maturing corn fields provided discrete
   population events that were well separated by location. In most
   instances trap capture of adults appears, on a local scale, to be
   related to these two events. However, in early season, the variability
   observed in trap capture and larval infestations on vegetative corn
   within regions provide difficulty in temporally defining the occurrence
   of meaningful events related to these variables across regions. When
   ambient air temperatures and wind velocity occurring during trap capture
   peaks were compared to those occurring two days prior and two days after
   after the peaks only minor correlations were observed. The implications
   are that trap capture values did not abruptly change with either
   significantly warmer or cooler temperatures or with increased or
   decreased zonal or meridional wind speed. We conclude that the
   atmospheric factors used as independent predictor variables were not
   correlated with the response of corn earworm males to pheromone traps,
   or with the long-distance atmospheric transport of populations into the
   trapping area. Our data further show that simulated nocturnal within
   regions, provide a mechanism for determining the atmospheric systems
   available to transport moths from one region to another.}},

Abstract = {{Adult populations of black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), males
   were monitored 1 June to 31 December 19851987. Texas 70-50-cm cone traps
   baited with sex pheromone were located north to south, 41 degrees 45'N
   to 25 degrees 45'N latitude, at Ankeny, Iowa; Columbia, Missouri;
   Crowley, Louisiana; and Beaumont, College Station, and Brownsville,
   Texas. Forecasts of nightly near-surface (100-300 m) airflow were
   recorded from 18 weather stations in the midcontinental United States.
   Average moth capture summed per 2-week interval for each Gulf Coast
   location was regressed upon nights of near surface northerly flow
   (southward displacement) summed per 2-week interval and also on average
   moth capture summed per 2-week interval at Ankeny or Columbia.
   Near-surface northerly flow was not a limiting factor at Crowley or
   Beaumont. Increased moth capture at Crowley was associated with
   decreased moth capture at Ankeny and Columbia during 1987. Although not
   significant, there was a consistent relationship between increased
   capture at Beaumont and decreased capture at Ankeny. Farther west, in
   south-central Texas, there was strong evidence for moths captured at
   College Station to be related to near-surface northerly flow (one of
   three years) and to source moths (two of three years) from Ankeny.
   Farther south and west, capture at Brownsville was also associated with
   near-surface northerly flow two of three years of the study. During
   1987, similar to moth capture at Crowley, moth capture at Brownsville
   was related to source moths from Ankeny. These results suggest that
   near-surface (100-300 m) northerly winds may be responsible for autumnal
   southward migration of black cutworm moths.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that adults of the
   black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), undergo both a spring and
   autumn migration in the United States. This migration activity involves
   the Corn Belt and southern regions, including the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Because of the importance of coastal influences on migration and because
   Texas is a probable source of moths migrating into the Midwest in April
   and May, the Texas coastline was chosen as a study area likely to
   produce winter-time data on black cutworm moth activity. In 1987-91,
   wing-style pheromone traps were used for short-term trapping of black
   cutworm moths along the Texas coastal region in an attempt to observe
   black cutworm moth premigratory activity from January to mid- to
   late-February. Texas-style cone traps monitored at locations on and near
   the Texas coast provided longer-term data on black cutworm moth
   activity. Data from moth captures along the coastal areas indicated some
   possible trends. Black cutworm moths were active throughout the winter
   months; however, greatest captures of moths tended to occur within a
   rather narrow time window in February. Black cutworm moths begin their
   well-documented northward transport approximately one month after major
   mid-winter coastal capture periods. If, as the weather patterns suggest,
   the source for moths captured in mid-winter in coastal areas is interior
   south-central and southeastern Texas, a study of the coastal populations
   during this behavior transition period may provide better prediction
   capabilities for the onset of the spring transport of black cutworm
   moths northward to the Corn Belt.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial populations capable of accumulating polyphosphate in pure
   culture were followed during the first 10 months of operation of a full
   scale biological nutrient removal plant with a modified U.C.T.
   configuration. Special emphasis was placed on the Acinetobacter isolates
   obtained. Results showed that of these, most could be identified as A.
   johnsonii (genospecies 7) although other genospecies including 9 and 12
   were also found in smaller numbers. A large number of these could not be
   identified with the Biolog system. Several other Gram positive and Gram
   negative bacterial genera capable of removing polyphosphate were also
   isolated from the biomass. The filamentous bacterial populations seen in
   the mixed liquor and foam were monitored regularly over this period, and
   after early changes, Microthrix parvicella and Eikelboom Types 0092 and
   0041/0675 gradually assumed dominance in the mixed liquor,while Nocardia
   amarae-like organisms and Type 0092 together with M. parvicella were in
   the foam.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored survival of 60 woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus)
   translocated from British Columbia to the Selkirk Mountains of northern
   Idaho between March 1987 and February 1992. This translocation was to
   assist in recovery of the endangered Selkirk population. For all
   translocated caribou combined, estimated annual survival rates ranged
   from 0.65-0.94 and were consistent with declining established
   populations. No differences (P > 0.10) in survival were found between
   male and female caribou or between mountain and northern ecotypes.
   Causes of death included unknown (n = 14), predation (n = 7), other (n =
   4), and human-caused (n = 2), with summer accounting for the greatest
   proportion (53\%). Emigration of 7 mountain ecotype animals also was a
   loss to the population. Mountain lions (Felis concolor) caused most
   confirmed predator kills. Seasonal pattern of mortality was consistent
   with established populations where predation was identified as a
   significant factor.}},

Abstract = {{Arm regeneration in the crinoid echinoderm Antedon mediterranea can
   provide a very useful model for studying regenerative development. This
   process can be described as an epimorphic process in which new
   structures develop from migratory actively proliferating cells. Both the
   repair and the regenerative phases are due to this fundamental
   mechanism, which is the only way of recruiting cells to form the
   cicatricial layer and the blastema. In order to identify the source, the
   proliferation sites and the recruitment times of these cells, cell
   proliferation was monitored by employing an immunocytochemical system to
   detect the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporated by
   S-phase cells of the regenerating tissues. On the basis of BrdU
   incorporation the actively proliferating elements can be identified both
   close and far from the amputation 1) in the populations of migratory
   cells which are produced at the level of the brachial nerve and the
   coelomic wall and 2) in the coelomic epithelium itself. These structures
   are preferential sources of new cells and give a differential
   contribution during the repair and the regenerative phases in terms of
   potential of cell proliferation. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The monitoring range of a sex pheromone trap for the rice stem borer
   moth, Chilo suppressalis, was evaluated by the bimodal distributions of
   male moth head width. The distribution of male moth head width in both
   flight seasons was a combination of the two normal distributions. The
   larger one was shown to be from male moths that fed on water oats
   (Zizania latifolia) during the larval stage and the smaller one was that
   of males that fed on rice plants (Oryza sativa). Male moths emerging
   from water oats were caught by pheromone traps set at six locations near
   a water oats population (< 250 m) at a higher rate in the second flight
   season than in the first. The reverse relationship was observed at five
   other locations (> 250 m). These results suggest that the monitoring
   range of a sex pheromone trap for this species is narrower in the second
   flight season than the first one, probably because of competition
   between wild virgin females and synthetic sex pheromone.}},

Abstract = {{A population of zoo bred Partula taeniata was released into a patch of
   native Polynesian plants in the Palm House at the Royal Botanic Gardens,
   Kew, London, UK. The released snails were from a colony established from
   wild-caught snails in 1982, which had been in captive conditions for up
   to six generations. Monitoring of the snails was continuous and
   intensive for the first 2 weeks, and at decreasing frequency over the
   next 15 months. There was high survivorship early on in the release, but
   once the intensive monitoring ended survivorship became hard to
   determine due to difficulties in locating snails in the large and
   complex habitat. However, snails are known to have persisted for at
   least 15 months, and new individuals have been noted maturing into all
   developmental stages. The snails exhibited patterns of feeding and
   microhabitat choice similar to those observed in the wild, despite being
   reared in a highly artificial environment. The methods and results
   provide some guidelines for future release trials for this highly
   endangered group of snails.}},

Abstract = {{The colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri is a model organism for
   research on invertebrate histocompatibility, development, and
   evolutionary biology. Nonetheless, the basic life history of Pacific
   Ocean populations of the species remains unknown. We determined field
   rates of growth, reproduction, and senescence in four cohorts of B.
   schlosseri colonies in Monterey Bay, California. Colonies grew
   exponentially as juveniles and reached sizes of up to 1400 zooids within
   69 days. After a juvenile phase lasting at least 49 days, the colonies
   began to reproduce sexually. Each zooid produced up to 10 clutches, each
   with a maximum of 5 eggs, resulting in very high fecundity of up to 8000
   eggs per colony. Following a short period (maximum 70 days) of
   continuous sexual reproduction, colonies abruptly senesced and died
   while still bearing a full clutch of eggs. Senescence progressed through
   four distinct stages over 1-2 weeks, and inevitably led to the
   simultaneous death of ail zooids in the colony. Although senescence was
   the main cause of mortality, some colonies died as a result of predation
   or undetermined causes. Certain life history traits varied significantly
   between cohorts that settled at different times of year. For example,
   lifespans in the field varied from about 3 months for spring to 8 months
   for fall-born colonies, but the lifetime fecundity of colonies did not
   vary between cohorts. The morphologies and life histories of colonies
   monitored in the field and reported here differed from those of colonies
   cultured previously in the laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal behavior has important effects on the persistence and
   recolonization of populations, but is one of the least understood traits
   of most organisms. Knowledge of patterns of fledgling, natal, and
   breeding dispersal of birds in a patchy environment will assist in
   decisions regarding reserve design and protection or construction of
   corridors. I present data on movement patterns of three migratory bird
   species, American Robin (Turdus migratorius) Brown Thrasher (Toxostoma
   rufum), and Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus). These birds are
   relatively common breeders in south-central North Dakota (U.S) in
   riparian woodlands and in shelterbelts (woodlots planted as windbreaks
   in the open agricultural environment). Field assistants and I
   individually marked and monitored the movements of more than 500 adults
   breeding in a network of shelterbelts across an 8 X II km study area.
   Most movement occurred at relatively short distances within a
   shelterbelt. Movements by adults between shelterbelt sites, although
   rare, occurred significantly more frequently between sites connected by
   a wooded corridor than between unconnected sites. For robins, there were
   on average 2.5 dispersal events between each pair of connected sites,
   but only O.17 dispersal events between each pair of unconnected sites
   (Mann-Whitney test significant at p < 0.009). Because unconnected and
   connected sites were similar in average area (1.7 to 1.9 ha), distance
   to next wooded habitat, and tree-species composition, this result
   provides a test of the hypothesis that organisms disperse preferentially
   along connecting corridors.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Recent declines in the number of breeding ducks in the Canadian
   prairie-parklands have been hypothesized to be due to loss of habitat to
   agriculture. However, prairie-parkland also has experienced wetland loss
   to drought as well as to agriculture. If habitat restoration is to be
   implemented and monitored successfully, it is important to separate the
   effects of anthropogenic changes to the landscape on duck populations
   from those caused by changes in climate. We used data from annual
   air-ground surveys and from precipitation records to develop
   relationships between indices of abundance of each of 10 species of
   ducks and indices of wetland conditions during 1955-1974. We used these
   relationships to predict annual abundance of each species during
   1975-1989. We compared predicted and observed abundances over the period
   1975-1989 to distinguish declines in duck abundance greater than those
   accounted for by drought alone and to determine the magnitude and
   location of real `'deficits'' in duck abundance. Average annual deficits
   within Canadian prairie-parkland over the period 1975-1989 were
   estimated at 1.2 X 10(6) birds for both Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and
   Northern Pintail (A. acuta), 480 000 for Blue-winged Teal (A. discors),
   190 000 for American Wigeon (A. americana), 175 000 for Northern
   Shoveler (A. clypeata), 50 000 for Gadwall (A. strepera), 10 000 for
   Green-winged Teal (A. crecca), 40 000 for Canvasback (Aythya
   valisineria), 25 000 for Lesser Scaup (A. affinis), and 5000 for Redhead
   (A. americana).
   Overall, the effect of agricultural expansion in the east on prime
   waterfowl habitat since 1951 appears to have been negligible. There, as
   much as 90\% had been already lost prior to 1951. In the west, however,
   where prime waterfowl habitat was still relatively abundant in 1951,
   agricultural development has encroached substantially. The relationship
   between the lost area of the best breeding habitats and the size of
   population deficits for Mallards and Northern Pintails in the entire
   Canadian prairie-parkland region was significant for both species (P <
   0.0027 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Consequently, habitat restoration
   programs located where the highest quality waterfowl habitat and the
   lowest quality agricultural lands overlap most should have the greatest
   potential to affect recovery of breeding duck populations in the
   Canadian prairie-parklands.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations in
   Texas, where high density polygyne red imported fire ants (Solenopsis
   invicta) account for >50\% of all (S. invicta) colonies, has been cited
   as a reason to repudiate impacts by this exotic species on Northern
   Bobwhite. We used two approaches to investigate the relationship between
   red imported fire ants acid Northern Bobwhite. In the first approach, we
   used correlation analysis to compare Northern Bobwhite abundance trends,
   determined from Christmas Bird Count data in 15 Texas counties, before
   and after fire ant infestation. Before red imported fire ant
   infestation, no significant trend in Bobwhite abundance existed (r=
   -0.355, P = 0.314). After fire ant infestation, Northern Bobwhite
   abundance declined and was highly negatively correlated with years of
   infestation (r = -0.867, P < 0.001). Bobwhite populations from 16
   uninfested counties in Texas revealed no trend over a 27-yr (1966-1992)
   period (r = -0.081, P = 0.688). In the second approach, red imported
   fire ant populations were reduced on five 202-ha study areas in the
   Texas Coastal Bend; autumn Northern Bobwhite densities were monitored
   for 2 yr on those reduced areas and five untreated areas. By the 2nd yr,
   Bobwhite autumn density was higher (P = 0.028) on areas where red
   imported fire ants were suppressed. We concluded that polygyne red
   imported fire ants were negatively impacting Northern Bobwhite in this
   region of Texas.}},

Abstract = {{Planning regulations pursuant to the National Forest Management Act of
   1976 require the USDA Forest Service to produce cost-effective,
   multiple-use forest plans that ensure the viability of native wildlife
   populations within the planning area. In accordance with these
   regulations, this paper presents a method for determining cost-effective
   conservation plans for sensitive wildlife species. The method is a
   decision framework for determining what forest areas should be managed
   as habitat to meet a population viability constraint and what areas
   should be used for timber production to maximize the present value of
   revenue from timber yields. The viability constraint is a minimum
   probability of meeting a standard for the risk of population extinction.
   This viability constraint focuses regulatory decisions on two key
   parameters: the standard for extinction risk and the probability of
   attaining the standard. The decision model is used to estimate the
   economic costs of these parameters. Examples for single- and multi-patch
   conservation problems show that the cost of habitat preservation
   increases as the standard for extinction risk becomes more stringent and
   as the required probability of attainment increases. Results from the
   decision model are useful for evaluating research and monitoring
   activities and determining the economically efficient risk standard.}},

Abstract = {{A two-component pheromone blend containing a 1:1 (vol:vol) ratio of
   isomeric 5,11-dimethylheptadecane and isomeric 2,5-dimethylheptadecane
   was tested in high-capacity Unitraps to monitor populations of the
   western hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria lugubrosa (Hulst),
   throughout the coastal western hemlock and interior cedar hemlock
   biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia. Rubber septa were loaded with
   each component at doses of 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 mu g (1992) and 1
   and 10 mu g (1993). Males demonstrated a dose-dependent response, except
   that captures in traps with the 2 highest doses (1,000 and 10,000 mu g)
   did not differ. Unitraps with 10-mu g lures captured significantly more
   males than similarly baited sticky traps at the beginning of the flight
   and with 1- and 10-mu g-baited lures at midflight. Both 1- and 10-mu g
   lures maintained their attractiveness over the 3-mo flight season, which
   extends from mid-August through October, but catches in traps with 1-mu
   g lures were low. In all cases, >80\% of the males were captured by the
   beginning of October. Seasonal trends in trap catches were not closely
   related io temperature. This research suggests that traps baited with
   10-mu g lures could be used to monitor populations and detect incipient
   outbreaks of the western hemlock looper.}},

Abstract = {{Fortuitous introductions of plant species with forestry planting
   material used in areas deforested by air pollution were studied in the
   Krusne hory Mountains, Czech Republic. The number and abundance of
   species of higher plants accompanying spruce saplings were recorded at
   three stages of the afforestation process: (1) before planting; (2)
   after planting; (3) after the first growing season. The reduction in the
   number of species and individuals during these stages of afforestation
   process was monitored. In total, 39 species were brought into the site
   with pre-grown saplings and 14 (36\%) became successfully established;
   the corresponding figures for the total number of individuals were 524
   (i.e. 1.024 per sapling) and 56 (i.e. 10.7\% of the original number),
   respectively. In terms of the number of species, the planting procedure
   itself accounted for 72\% of total losses, whereas the remaining 28\%
   died during the first year of growth on the site. In terms of the
   mortality of individuals, the corresponding figures were 90\% and 10\%.
   Annuals were reduced to a greater extent than perennials. Epilobium
   adenocaulon and Betula pendula were the most successful species in terms
   of the size of established population. Eight species previously not
   reported from the area under study were found accompanying the
   transported saplings. The importance of introductions for the
   ruderalisation of forest sites is discussed. Considering the extent
   (millions of saplings being planted each year) and duration (two
   centuries in Europe) of afforestation efforts, it is suggested that this
   form of dispersal has caused an important enrichment to the local flora.}},

Abstract = {{1. We hypothesized that the fishery management practices of toxaphene
   application and trout stocking would affect non-target organisms in
   lakes. Because these practices were rarely monitored in the past,
   cladoceran and algal assemblages were quantified in sediment cores from
   two lakes treated 30+ years ago to determine the long-term response of
   organisms near the base of the food chain.
   2. Chydorids were remarkably resistant over the short term (a few years)
   in both the oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes despite toxaphene
   treatments that extirpated native fish and other invertebrates. In the
   oligotrophic lake (Annette Lake), six chydorid taxa were less abundant
   in the years following treatment, although no loss of species richness
   was detected. In the eutrophic lake (Chatwin Lake), the dominant
   Chydorus cf. sphaericus declined coincident with toxaphene treatment,
   but longer-term declines of all taxa were probably related to food web
   or other changes rather than to toxaphene toxicity. Cause and effect
   coupling was complicated by the fact that many chydorids were present at
   low concentrations in some pretreatment samples.
   3. The algal communities (as fossil pigments) responded to treatment
   differently in the two lakes. In the oligotrophic lake, planktonic
   diatoms, dinoflagellates and chlorophytes were replaced as dominants by
   deep-water or benthic blooming cryptophytes, chrysophytes and
   cyanobacteria. This shift occurred along with increases in large
   daphnids and the `grazing indicator', pheophorbide a. While both lakes
   appear to have had enhanced pigment preservation following treatment,
   the eutrophic lake encountered few long-term changes in its fossil
   pigment assemblage. Redundancy analysis estimated that the presence or
   absence of stocked trout explained much of the variation in the algal
   assemblages, particularly in the oligotrophic lake.
   4. Toxaphene remained elevated in profundal sediments from these lakes
   30 and 35 years after treatment.}},

Abstract = {{1. The influence of annual and seasonal (summer versus winter) rainfall
   variability and of different seasons and systems of sheep grazing,
   including complete protection, on the botanical species composition of a
   community characterized by dwarf shrubs, annual and perennial grasses,
   and ephemeral dicotyledons, was investigated for 23 years in the Karoo,
   South Africa.
   2. Ordination and bivariate techniques revealed dramatic changes in
   response to interannual rainfall variability, mostly associated with
   annuals or short-lived perennials. Annual rainfall showed a pronounced
   temporal pattern being wetter in the 1950s and drier in the 1960s, and
   with annual rainfall correlated with summer rainfall.
   3. Annual grasses and ephemeral dicotyledons irrupted in certain years
   of suitable rainfall to an extent that was influenced by grazing
   treatments. Perennial grasses and shrubs were strongly influenced by
   rainfall variation, with grazing treatments further influencing the rate
   and extent of change. Only perennial grasses were almost eliminated by
   grazing during the summer.
   4. Community change was mostly driven by rainfall variation, but the
   influence of grazing treatments on longer-lived plants became more
   important over a longer time period. The community was therefore a
   matrix of longer-lived perennial grasses and dwarf shrubs within which
   dramatic variations in the abundance of annual grasses and ephemeral
   forbs took place.
   5. The need is discussed for long-term data sets and appropriate
   monitoring approaches, as aids to a more complete understanding of the
   forces determining community structure in semi-arid environments.}},

Abstract = {{Olfactory synergism, where combinations of plant volatile kairomones are
   quantitatively more attractive to insects than the sum of attraction of
   the individual components, is an important but little-studied phenomenon
   in host plant selection and feeding and in pollination ecology.
   Diabroticite beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are strongly attracted
   to Cucurbita blossoms, and 2- to 5-fold olfactory synergism has been
   demonstrated in four species by combinations of the key blossom
   volatiles, 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, indole, and (E)-cinnamaldehyde, This
   TIC mixture represents an optimized Curcurbita blossom volatile
   kairomone mixture useful in monitoring Diabroticite populations and in
   studying their behavior and ecology. Indole, which exhibits a spectrum
   of attraction to these beetles ranging from moderate for Diabrotica
   virgifera virgifera and Acalymma vittatum to very weak for D. barberi,
   is the primary synergistic component. Indole combined with
   4-methoxycinnamaldehyde was significantly synergistic to D. v. virgifera
   at a ratio of 1:300 and produced 4-fold synergism at a ratio of 1:1.
   Indole combined with 4-methoxyphenethanol was less synergistic to D.
   barberi with 1.5- to 2-fold synergism at a 1:1 ratio. These consistent
   variations in diabroticite beetle olfactory responses presumably
   indicate evolutionary divergences in the numbers of relict indole
   antennal receptors.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the relationship between seed production and seedling
   recruitment in Quercus robur in order to determine whether oak
   recruitment was seed-limited, herbivore-limited or microsite-limited.
   Over a 15-year period, Q. robur showed a pattern of alternate bearing,
   with significant (but not complete) synchrony between individual trees
   at several sites in south-east England.
   2 Seedling recruitment was assessed in three ways: by annual destructive
   sampling, by monitoring permanent quadrats, and by ageing destructive
   samples of saplings using basal ring counts.
   3 Seedling recruitment was closely correlated with the size of the acorn
   crop in some habitats but not others. In Sunningdale, where a
   competition-free seed bed was available every year and where seed
   predators were relatively scarce, oak seedlings appeared almost every
   year, and three peak densities of seedling recruitment followed three
   peaks of acorn production during the period 1985-92. In Silwood Park,
   where rabbits were abundant, there was little seedling recruitment
   except within rabbit exclosures and then only in years of peak acorn
   production. In Windsor Great Park, rabbit densities were lower and
   seedling recruitment was higher than at Silwood Park, but the
   association between seedling recruitment and acorn production could not
   be established with confidence because of imprecision in ageing the
   saplings.
   4 Rates of acorn loss to invertebrate seed predators were broadly
   consistent with the hypothesis of predator satiation; low acorn crops
   suffered a higher percentage mortality than large acorn crops. The two
   principal acorn-feeding insects (the alien cynipid gall wasp Andricus
   quercuscalicis and the native weevil Curculio glandium) killed between
   30\% and 90\% of the acorn crop in given years and between 0\% and 100\%
   of the acorn crop on individual trees. Vertebrate herbivores
   (principally rabbits and wood mice) destroyed most of the sound acorns
   in low years, removing experimentally placed acorns within 24h.
   5 The effectiveness of alternate bearing as a defence against
   short-lived, specialist insect herbivores and long-lived, generalist
   vertebrate herbivores is discussed. The evidence presently available
   does not allow us to discriminate between the competing hypotheses that
   alternate bearing is an evolved, antipredator strategy on the part of
   the oaks, or a constraint imposed by limited resource availability
   within the trees.
   6 We conclude that the relationship between seed production and seedling
   recruitment in Quercus robur is variable from site to site: oak
   recruitment is seed-limited in open sites where vertebrate herbivores
   are scarce, microsite-limited beneath a dense forest canopy, but
   herbivore-limited in other sites, especially those where rabbits are
   abundant.}},

Abstract = {{1 Hylocomium splendens is a perennial clonal moss with annual
   periodicity in the emergence of new modules. New growing points usually
   emerge in spring and develop into mature segments their second summer.
   Population increase is brought about by ramification (branching) of the
   youngest segment or by regeneration from older parts of the shoot
   system.
   2 A technique for nondestructive re-identification of segments in
   permanent plots is devised. Precise demographic information on 9206
   growing points and 7602 mature segments was obtained by following 119
   local populations in seven Norwegian reference areas for monitoring
   during 3 years. The dry weight of each mature segment was estimated from
   morphological field measurements.
   3 The potential of each mature segment for production of new growing
   points was strongly size-dependent; c. 40\% of the variation in a
   segment's size was explained by the size of its mother segment.
   Integration within segment chains was largely restricted to neighbouring
   segments. The number offspring growing points (by ramification as well
   as regeneration) was positively size-dependent, while termination risk
   was negatively size-dependent. Mature segments produced by regeneration
   were smaller, while segments produced by ramification were larger than
   the average segment. Strong apical dominance was demonstrated.
   4 Mortality and branching rates, averaged over populations, areas and
   years, are reported. Annual recruitment was 32.3\%; 23.3\% by
   regeneration, 7.5\% by ramification, and 1.5\% by accidentally
   introduced shoots. Annual mortality was 19.7\%. 6.8\% by loss, 1.9\% by
   grazing, and 11.0\% by termination for other reasons.
   5 Demographic data for growing points and mature segments were analysed
   separately by stage-structured transition matrix models. The total
   population increased every year (average lambda = 1.10-1.11). Vital
   rates were strongly size-dependent. The contributions of ramification
   and regeneration to increase in lambda are equal as ramification
   occurred in large segments with high probability for survival.
   6 Ramification is considered important for maintenance of size and
   risk-spreading among ramets under favourable conditions, while high
   regenerative ability facilitates resilience to, and recovery after,
   disturbance. The ecological significance of size is discussed.
   7 Hylocomium splendens is closely similar to clonal forest vascular
   plants in major demographic traits, e.g. size-dependence of fitness and
   branching patterns.}},

Abstract = {{A better understanding of the relationships between endangered San
   Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis mutica) and sympatric larger canids
   that prey on them is important for conservation efforts toward kit
   foxes. We used radiotelemetry to monitor the survival and cause of death
   of 41 San Joaquin kit foxes and 24 coyotes (Canis latrans) on the
   Carrizo Plain Natural Area, California, during the 1989-1991 drought.
   The estimated minimum-annual-survival rate for all coyotes was 0.88.
   Estimated annual-survival rates for juvenile foxes (0.21-0.41) were
   somewhat less than those for adult foxes (0.58-0.61). Survival rates for
   foxes were similar across years and sexes. Larger canids accounted for
   78\% of 23 verified deaths of kit foxes: 15 killed by coyotes; 2 by
   non-native red foxes (Vulpes vulpes); 1 by a domestic dog. High
   predation by larger canids, coupled with poor reproduction in kit foxes
   due to reduced prey availability during the drought, contributed to a
   significant decrease in density of kit foxes (from 0.24 to 0.12
   foxes/km(2)) during the study. Although coyotes can have a significant
   impact on populations of kit foxes, larger non-native red foxes may pose
   a greater threat in some areas.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the cannibalistic behaviour of the freshwater
   amphipods Gammarus duebeni celticus Stock and Pinkster, 1970 and G.
   pulex (L., 1758). In the first experiment, interactions were staged
   among all combinations of single adult males, single adult females,
   adults in the precopulatory mate-guarding phase and juveniles.
   Cannibalism by inter-moult individuals on newly moulted conspecifics
   occurred in all interaction categories in both species. Gammarus d.
   celticus, however, were significantly more cannibalistic than G. pulex.
   Cannibalism between and within sex and size categories (males > females
   > juveniles) was facilitated by the vulnerability of individuals at
   moult. Individuals of smaller size categories, however, did not
   cannibalize newly moulted conspecifics of larger size categories. Males
   were less cannibalistic on newly moulted females than on newly moulted
   males and juveniles and, when in the precopulatory condition, appeared
   to defend females from cannibalistic attacks. In a second experiment,
   stream conditions were simulated in the laboratory and replicated
   populations monitored for nine weeks. High levels of cannibalism, and
   the species and sex differences in cannibalism identified in the first
   experiment, were confirmed under these heterogeneous conditions.
   Cannibalism by males on their newly moulted female mating partners,
   termed `reversed' sexual cannibalism, was further investigated. When
   males were deprived of foraging opportunities, cannibalism of
   precopulatory partners was significantly more frequent. The occurrence
   of `reversed' sexual cannibalism is thus interpreted as a conflict
   between motivation to feed and motivation to mate.}},

   dynamics of coral-reef fishes. To examine the role of predation,
   resident piscivorous fishes {[}moray eels (Muraenidae), large
   squirrelfishes (Holocentridae), groupers (Serranidae), and snappers
   (Lutjanidae)] were removed from 3 of 6 isolated patch reefs of living
   coral near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas, in 1992. All 6 reefs were then
   seeded with natural densities of newly settled recruits of 3 species:
   Chromis cyanea (blue chromis, Pomacentridae), Halichoeres pictus
   (rainbow wrasse, Labridae), and Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse,
   Labridae). Controls showed that any secondary effects of transplanting
   new recruits were negligible. Over the next month, survivorship of C.
   cyanea (mean: 41.3\%) and H. pictus (80.8\%) on the predator-absent
   reefs was significantly greater than on the predator-present (control)
   reefs (9.4\% for C. cyanea and 43.2\% for H. pictus). No statistical
   difference was evident for T. bitasciatum (48.5 vs 37.8\% survival),
   perhaps because juveniles of this species are cleaner fish and/or
   because they were less conspicuous to predators than the other species.
   Although the size distributions of the wrasses did not differ between
   treatments, the size distribution of C. cyanea shifted significantly. At
   the end of the experiment, surviving C, cyanea were slightly larger on
   the predator-present reefs (mode = 4.0 cm total length, TL) than on the
   predator-absent reefs (mode = 3.5 cm TL), despite no significant
   difference at the start of the experiment (mode for both treatments =
   3.0 cm TL). We interpret this size shift as predators differentially
   consuming smaller recruits and/or surviving recruits growing faster
   after densities were reduced by predators. Preliminary remote video
   monitoring of the activity of transient piscivores {[}mostly jacks
   (Carangidae)] over the experimental reefs suggested that such predators
   may regularly visit isolated reefs in search of prey. If so, transient
   predators may have accounted for the surprisingly low first-month
   survivorship (about 40 to 80\%) of new recruits on reefs where resident
   predators were removed. In any case, we conclude that resident predators
   can substantially alter the local density and size structure of reef
   fishes shortly after they settle from the plankton. Because piscivores
   differentially affected the survivorship of different species, predation
   may also influence the structure of reef-fish communities by altering
   the relative abundances of prey species established at the time of
   settlement.}},

Abstract = {{Simulated howling provided information on the location of coyotes (Canis
   latrans) and gray wolves (Canis lupus) in north-central Washington.
   Coyotes responded to simulated howling at a rate of 9.9\% and wolves at
   a rate of 0.1\% from April through October. The low response rate for
   wolves can most likely be attributed to low density in our study area.
   Response rates of coyotes were highest in September and October, and
   during dawn and dusk. Both wolf responses occurred during early August
   and at dusk. The sex of the person simulating the howl did not affect
   the response rate. There was not a significant difference in the
   response rates of coyotes between backcountry and road surveys.
   Monitoring the RR/S of these species may be useful in estimating the
   response of coyotes to a recolonizing wolf population. This method would
   be a useful component in programs monitoring the populations of wolves
   and coyotes.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of removal. of breeding nomadic avian predators
   (the kestrel, Falco tinnunculus and Tengmalm's owl, Aegolius funereus)
   on small mammals (voles of the genera Microtus and Clethrionomys and the
   common shrew, Sorer araneus) during 1989-1992 in western Finland to find
   out if these predators have a regulating or limiting impact on their
   prey populations. We removed potential breeding sites of rapt ors from
   five manipulation areas (c. 3 km(2) each), whereas control areas had
   nest-boxes in addition to natural cavities and stick-nests. Densities of
   small mammals were monitored by snap-trapping in April, June, and
   August, and densities of mammalian predators (the least weasel, Mustela
   nivalis nivalis, the stoat, M. erminea and the red fox, Vulpes vulpes)
   by snow tracking in early spring and late autumn. The yearly mean number
   of raptor breeding territories was 0.2-1.0 in reduction areas and
   3.0-8.2 in control areas. Breeding raptors alone did not regulate prey
   populations in the long term, but probably caused short-term changes in
   the population dynamics of both the main prey, the sibling vole
   (Microtus rossiaemeridionalis) and an alternative prey (the common
   shrew). The densities of an alternative prey, the bank vole
   (Clethrionomys glareolus) decreased in raptor reduction areas, most
   likely due to increased least weasel predation pressure in the absence
   of breeding avian predators.}},

Abstract = {{Debate on the control of population dynamics in reef fishes has centred
   on whether patterns in abundance are determined by the supply of
   planktonic recruits, or by post-recruitment processes. Recruitment
   limitation implies little or no regulation of the reef-associated
   population, and is supported by several experimental studies that failed
   to detect density dependence. Previous manipulations of population
   density have, however, focused on juveniles, and there have been no
   tests for density-dependent interactions among adult reef fishes. I
   tested for population regulation in Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, a
   small, short-lived goby that is common in the Caribbean. Adult density
   was manipulated on artificial reefs and adults were also monitored on
   reefs where they varied in density naturally. Survival of adult gobies
   showed a strong inverse relationship with their initial density across a
   realistic range of densities. Individually marked gobies, however, grew
   at similar rates across all densities, suggesting that density-dependent
   survival was not associated with depressed growth, and so may result
   from predation or parasitism rather than from food shortage. Like adult
   survival, the accumulation of new recruits on reefs was also much lower
   at high adult densities than at low densities. Suppression of
   recruitment by adults may occur because adults cause either reduced
   larval settlement or reduced early post-settlement survival. In summary,
   this study has documented a previously unrecorded regulatory mechanism
   for reef fish populations (density-dependent adult mortality) and
   provided a particularly strong example of a well-established mechanism
   (density-dependent recruitment). In combination, these two compensatory
   mechanisms have the potential to strongly regulate the abundance of this
   species, and rule out the control of abundance by the supply of
   recruits.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the collembolan community were studied during the
   decomposition of conifer needles. Organic matter, nitrogen and carbon
   mass, and collembolan populations in litter bags, were monitored over a
   5 year period. Decomposition of Chamaecyparis obtusa needle litter was
   represented by three phases; the initial leaching of nitrogen (0 - 3
   months), nitrogen immobilization (3 - 200 months), and nitrogen
   mobilization (20 - 60 months) and thus provided three resource states
   for the colonization of collembolan species. The species composition of
   the collembolan community in the soil was constant over the study
   period, while the litter bag communities showed seasonal and
   successional changes. According to the successional patterns,
   collembolan species were classified into three groups; the species
   occurring in the immobilization phase, the species abundant during the
   immobilization and mobilization phases, and the species occurred in the
   mobilization phase. The successional changes of Collembola may be
   explained through immigration and emigration of species into or from the
   litter bags in response to the litter fall supply and decomposition
   phases. The litter bag study suggests that the collembolan community
   might be maintained at an equilibrium state through the responses of
   individual species to the litter fall supply and decomposition process.}},

Abstract = {{The Biomass Production Chamber at John F. Kennedy Space Center is a
   closed plant growth chamber facility that can be used to monitor the
   level of biogenic emissions from large populations of plants throughout
   their entire growth cycle. The head space atmosphere of a 26-day-old
   lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann's Green) stand was repeatedly
   sampled and emissions identified and quantified using GC-mass
   spectrometry. Concentrations of dimethyl sulphide, carbon disulphide,
   alpha-pinene, furan and 2-methylfuran were not significantly different
   throughout the day; whereas, isoprene showed significant differences in
   concentration between samples collected in light and dark periods.
   Volatile organic compounds from the atmosphere of wheat (Triticum
   aestivum cv. Yecora Rojo) were analysed and quantified from planting to
   maturity. Volatile plant-derived compounds included 1-butanol,
   2-ethyl-1-hexanol, nonanal, benzaldehyde, tetramethylurea,
   tetramethylthiourea, 2-methylfuran and 3-methylfuran. Concentrations of
   volatiles were determined during seedling establishment, vegetative
   growth, anthesis, grain fill and senescence and found to vary depending
   on the developmental stage. Atmospheric concentrations of benzaldehyde
   and nonanal were highest during anthesis, 2-methylfuran and
   3-methylfuran concentrations were greatest during grain fill, and the
   concentration of the tetramethylurea peaked during senescence.}},

Abstract = {{The infectivity to wheat seedlings of ascospores from apothecia of
   Tapesia yallundae grown in vitro was demonstrated for the first time.
   The infection process from spore adhesion to lesion formation was
   monitored using low-temperature scanning electron microscopy and was
   similar to that observed for conidia of the anamorph,
   Pseudocercosporeila herpotrichoides. Mycelium isolated from lesions was
   characterized using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers
   and was compared to DNA amplification patterns obtained for parental
   isolates from which the teleomorph was induced. Recombination was
   demonstrated in all but one lesion from which mycelium was successfully
   reisolated. A high proportion of reisolates had unique RAPD profiles,
   indicative of novel genotypes. The implications for pathogenic variation
   and the development of fungicide resistance in the field are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The king penguin colony at Ile aux Cochons, Crozet Archipelago (southern
   Indian Ocean) is the largest in the world. The change in its surface
   area was investigated by means of satellite remote sensing using spot
   scene. The satellite picture enabled us to locate the colony and to
   determine that the surface area occupied by the colony has increased by
   56\% between 1962 and 1988. The increase in the surface area occupied by
   the colony was confirmed by a map realised in 1982 (by the Institut
   Geographique National). The high resolution system available on the spot
   system which allows at present at 10 m ground resolution, and 5 m in the
   near future, can thus be a useful tool for monitoring medium to
   long-term changes in marine bird populations breeding in colonies
   composed of birds spaced a constant distance from one another. Based on
   the surface area occupied by the colony and the published data on the
   population size on Possession Island, as well as information on the
   breeding frequency of the species, we estimated that the total breeding
   population is about 1,000,000 pairs for the whole archipelago and that
   about 70\% of birds breed at Ile aux Cochons.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental model system is presented that allows the identification
   and follow-up of mice exposed to ionizing radiation using
   flow-cytometric measurements of peripheral blood cells. In an
   experiment, properties of peripheral blood cells were analysed with flow
   cytometry for a rapid identification of individuals exposed to
   radiation. Individuals were then followed longitudinally in an attempt
   to identify those developing neoplasias. Male CBA mice, 25 days old,
   were subjected to fractionated x-irradiation (4 x 1.31 Gy) to induce
   haematopoietic malignancies. By repeated blood sampling followed by flow
   cytometry, frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes and of
   proliferating nucleated cells were determined. Neoplasias were diagnosed
   by histopathology. Five days after the end of radiation exposure,
   increased frequencies of proliferating cells, polychromatic erythrocytes
   and micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes clearly distinguished the
   exposed group from the control group. Increased cell prolife ration in
   peripheral blood cells could be used to identify animals with manifest
   tumours, although these animals were at a late stage of tumour
   development. Animals with thymic lymphoma (not generalized) could not be
   identified with the flow-cytometric parameters used. We consider that
   this model system has a potential use when a small number of risk
   individuals need to be identified and monitored within a large
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to analyse the short-term effects of
   restoration on river morphology, flow field, substrate and biota. One of
   the aims of the restoration measures is to arrest the degradation of the
   river Drau, which has caused technical (instability of bank protection
   measures) and ecological (loss of dynamic river reaches with alternate
   bars) problems. The restoration programme consists of several measures
   such as digging a new side channel on the right side, leaving an island
   and erection of groins on the left side of the main channel. These were
   made to keep the entrance open. After a two year monitoring programme
   the results of the analysis show that with respect to the river
   morphology, flow held and substrate, positive and negative effects were
   recorded, whereas for the ecology, positive effects were in general
   documented. Repeated morphological surveys using an echosounder showed
   that within a year without major flood events the main channel aggraded
   on average about 16 cm and the upper parts of the island degraded by up
   to Im. The groin pools became partially filled due to their function as
   sediment traps for finer material during low flows. Subsequent,
   measurements performed after several hoods showed that degradation
   reduced the amount of aggradation by 50\%. Flow velocity measurements
   demonstrated the effects of groins and their inability to force the main
   flow path to the side channel. In contrast with the main channel, the
   side channel was characterized by highly variable sediment grain sizes
   and dynamic morphological changes. The lower shear stresses and higher
   growth of algae in the side channel were associated with higher numbers
   of species of macroinvertebrates. Population studies showed
   significantly higher densities of fish species in this reach with a side
   channel than in any other river reach. Forty species of birds were
   observed, seven of which were typical water-related species, and the
   number of plant species increased from 48 to 118.}},

Abstract = {{Shell length and tissue growth, biomass and production of 1-2-year-old
   mussels suspended from salmon sea cages, mussel rafts and long-lines
   were monitored during May 1990-May 1992 in Lochs Etive and Leven on the
   west coast of Scotland. Water temperature, salinity and food
   availability were also determined. These showed a clear seasonal cycle
   and, in consequence, growth of mussels was relatively rapid from May to
   October and very slow or absent during the rest of the year. Particulate
   organic matter and chlorophyll-a were higher at salmon farms than at
   adjacent mussel farms (significant at P < 0.05 with POM in Loch Etive).
   Maximum tissue growth occurred during April-May and shell length during
   June-August. Tissue growth and hence production were negative during
   winter (October-April). Annual length increments of 25.1-25.9 mm at
   sites in Loch Etive were significantly greater than those of 20.1-22.8
   mm in Loch Leven (P < 0.001). This difference is due to greater
   temperature and food availability in Loch Etive and possible heavy metal
   stress in Loch Leven. Shell length growth of mussels at salmon farms was
   slightly higher than at neighbouring shellfish farms, but differences
   were significant only during 1991-92 (P < 0.001). A multiple regression
   model of the effects of environmental factors on shell length increment
   gave significant coefficients for water temperature and chlorophyll-a,
   together accounting for 67-88\% of total variance, but the effect of
   non-algal POM (estimated by difference between total POM and that
   associated with chlorophyll) was significant only in Loch Etive in
   1990-91, where it explained 6\% of the variance (P < 0.05). In addition
   there were significant differences in live (whole) and wet and dry meat
   weights (P < 0.05), and in situ production losses at salmon farms during
   winter were less than at shellfish farms, indicating that mussels at
   salmon farms did not deplete their reserves as much as those at mussel
   farms. The differences in performance between salmon and shellfish farms
   probably resulted from the utilization of higher organic matter
   concentrations at salmon farms. The advantages and disadvantages of
   integrating filter-feeding bivalves with cage culture of finfish are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The joint project, `Environmental Monitoring and Impact Assessment in
   Nigeria' consisted of universities from Nigeria, Germany and Great
   Britain, and was funded by the European Union. Within the context of
   this project, an air monitoring station was purchased and placed in
   Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria. In addition to these permanent
   measurements, single samples were taken at different places in Lagos. A
   northern wind, the so-called Harmattan, transports much dust from the
   Sahara. But most of the identified air pollution in Lagos is caused by
   the traffic which can even be recognized without measurements, by strong
   turbidity, bad smell and eye irritation. This pollution is caused by the
   combination of many strongly emitting vehicles and frequent traffic
   jams. Diesel vehicles emit plumes of black smoke consisting of soot.
   Many petrol engined cars exhaust blue smoke which is caused by unburnt
   oil; market places are established especially around bus stops, and many
   people are exposed to unhealthily high concentrations of aromatic
   hydrocarbons, CO and particles. The results of measurements at such
   places are presented here. The measured CO values, for instance, often
   exceed the limits set by WHO guidelines. These initial results show that
   drastic measures are necessary to protect the population against this
   high pollution. The measured benzene concentrations cause a raised
   carcinogenic risk.}},

Abstract = {{Juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) are omnivorous, and the
   question asked in this study is how they affect on their environment? Do
   they mainly act as predators on the cladoceran zooplankton or do they
   compete with the cladocerans for phytoplankton? This problem was studied
   in three ponds with and three ponds without small tilapia (3-5 cm). The
   fish growth rate, the succession of plankton species and the changes in
   abiotic conditions, were monitored over a period of 67 days. The fish
   biomass was kept low and the mean was approximately constant (12.6 g
   m(-2)) during the experiment. Phosphate was added to avoid phytoplankton
   nutrient limitation. Although the diet of Nile tilapia contained both
   phytoplankton and zooplankton, the fish affected the ecosystem in a
   similar way as zooplanktivorous fish. The fish ponds got more
   phytoplankton due to increase of Chlorophyta. Effects on the other
   phytoplankton groups Euglenophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cryptophyta and
   Cyanophyta could not be registered. The ponds without fish had higher
   densities of Daphnia lumholtzi and D. barbata. The other Cladocerans
   seemed less influenced by fish presence. The relative fish growth rate
   was most positively correlated with the density of Daphnia lumholtzi,
   Diaphanosmoa excisum and Bosmina longirostris. Tilapia seemes to have
   two feeding modes: (1) preying on large zooplankton and (2) unselective
   filtration of small planktonic organisms such as phytoplankton. In our
   experiment the first feeding mode affected the ecosystem more than the
   second.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history traits associated with midwestern breeding bird population
   trends were assessed using data from the North American Breeding Bird
   Survey (BBS). Analyses of BBS population trends by bird-habitat
   association, nest location and migratory strategy groups showed that
   grassland bird species had exhibited more extensive population declines
   between 1966 and 1993 than other groups of midwestern breeding bird
   species. Analysis of species representation in the midwestern BBS data,
   however, revealed significant biases in species representation based on
   habitat associations. Wetland bird species are significantly
   underrepresented on midwestern BBS routes, whereas urban and
   shrubland/early successional bird species are overrepresented relative
   to other groups of bird species. Because of these differences in species
   representation, additional surveys and monitoring programs are needed in
   order to compile a comprehensive pattern of population vends of
   midwestern breeding birds.}},

Abstract = {{The spittlebug, Aeneolania albofasciata Lalleman, is the most
   economically important insect pest of buffelgrass pastures in Mexico. In
   1984-1986 we studied the effect of climate on the life cycle of this
   insect in Sonora, Mexico, by monitoring spittlebug nymph and adult
   densities in relation to summer precipitation and maximum and minimum
   temperatures. The amount of summer precipitation appeared to be the most
   important climatic factor affecting spittlebug population density and
   duration of nymphal and adult life stages. The correlation coefficient
   between cumulative summer rainfall and density of nymphs was 0.93, and
   for adults it was 0.92 in the 3 yr. Mean maximum, and minimum
   temperatures, however, were not related to adult or nymphal densities in
   any year. Hatch of overwintered eggs was initiated after 45-60 mm of
   summer rainfall. Total and peak adults were higher in 1984 when
   precipitation was two times above normal (320 mm) than in 19S5 and 1986
   when precipitation was below and approximately average. Insect densities
   declined when preoipitation was below normal (286 mm) in 1985.
   Life-cycle duration from the first-instar nymph through adult averaged
   43 +/- 3 d across the 3 yr. The spittlebug was univoltine in 1985 and
   1986, however, during wet years (such as 1984), nymphal and adult stages
   can be present for a longer period.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed data from a long-term fisheries-independent monitoring
   program to quantitatively assess seasonal variations in species
   diversity, abundance, and composition of fish communities in the
   northern Indian River Lagoon. Between fall 1990 and 1993, over 2.24
   million fish representing 108 species and 43 families were collected by
   using seines, trawls, and gillnets during seasonal stratified-random
   sampling and monthly fixed-station sampling regimes. Seasonal
   collections were numerically dominated by less than 10 small estuarine
   forage species including Anchoa mitchilli, Menidia spp., Floridichthys
   carpio, and Lucania parva which were present in high abundances
   throughout the year. We observed strong seasonal patterns in abundance
   measures for several less common or transient species collected from
   shallow-water habitats (e.g., Brevoortia spp., Trachinotus falcatus,
   Caranx hippos, Cynoscion nebulosus, and Leiostomus xanthurus) and from
   lagoon-basin habitats (e.g., Micropogonias undulatus and Diapterus
   auratus). Estimates of species richness and abundance were directly
   correlated with water temperature, reaching maxima during summer or fall
   and minima during winter. Species diversity (H') ranged from 0.9-1.4 and
   followed similar seasonal trends. This study provides baseline estimates
   of seasonal variations in fish communities of the northern Indian River
   Lagoon, based on comprehensive sampling techniques, that can be used for
   future comparisons of Indian River Lagoon fish communities.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study presented here was to simultaneously measure
   air quality and respiratory function and symptoms in populations living
   in the neighborhood of waste incinerators and to estimate the
   contribution of incinerator emissions to the particulate air mass in
   these neighborhoods. We studied the residents of three communities
   having, respectively, a biomedical and municipal incinerator, and a
   liquid hazardous waste-burning industrial furnace. We compared results
   with three matched-comparison communities. We did not detect differences
   in concentrations of particulate matter among any of the three pairs of
   study communities. Average fine particulate (PM(2.5)) concentrations
   measured for 35 days varied across study communities from 16 to
   32mug/m(3). Within the same community, daily concentrations of fine
   particulates varied by as much as eightfold, from 10 to 80mug/m(3), and
   were nearly identical within each pair of communities. Direct
   measurements of air quality and estimates based on a chemical mass
   balance receptor model showed that incinerator emissions did not have a
   major or even a modest impact on routinely monitored air pollutants. A
   one-time baseline descriptive survey (n=6963) did not reveal consistent
   community differences in the prevalence of chronic or acute respiratory
   symptoms between incinerator and comparison communities, nor did we see
   a difference in baseline lung function tests or in the average peak
   expiratory flow rate measured over a period of 35 days. Based on this
   analysis of the first year of our study, we conclude that we have no
   evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no acute or chronic
   respiratory effects associated with residence in an of the three
   incinerator communities.}},

Abstract = {{Many environmental data sets contain observations which are below the
   method or instrumental limit of detection which are often referred to as
   `censored data'. These censored data create great uncertainties in the
   data analysis for the environmental quality management. It is necessary
   to quantify these uncertainties in order to determine compliance, or
   non-compliance, with relevant environmental quality standards, to
   estimate the parameters used in assessment models, and to monitor the
   environmental quality. The analyses for data sets that contain censored
   data are not new, but most distribution free methods require large
   sample sizes. For a data set containing censored observations with a
   small size, e.g. n = 3, which is typically observed for environmental
   samples, distribution free techniques will fail to provide reasonable
   answers due to the tremendous uncertainties in the analysis, This paper
   is proposed to demonstrate one approach which could be used to analyse
   environmental data sets with small sample sizes. If a distribution is
   known to be normal, or log-normal, optimal estimates are easily
   obtained. In the scientific investigation that motivated this study, at
   most three observations are available. We address two statistical
   questions. The first concerns normality. If all the populations are
   normal, even with different means and variances, we can obtain an
   overall check of fit. To do so, we propose to calculate the correlation
   between the three order statistics and the normal scores. The
   distribution of the whole set of correlations is then compared to what
   it would be if all of the populations are normal. Secondly, we consider
   transformations of the original observations and illustrate how our
   goodness-of-fit procedure can be used to select a transformation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of elk (Cervus elaphus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana),
   and. mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) browsing on shrubs in big sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata) communities were monitored over a 31-year period
   in Yellowstone National Park. Ungulates were restricting Wyoming big
   sagebrush (spp. wyomingensis) heights, size, and recruitment on the
   lower-elevation stratum only, while no such suppression was observed on
   the high-elevation stratum. Parallel increases in mountain big sagebrush
   (spp. vaseyana) densities and cover occurred over the study period on
   both browsed and unbrowsed sites at the higher-elevation stratum,
   although big sagebrush, green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus
   viscidiflourus), and horsebrush (Tetradymia canescens) were slightly
   taller and crown sizes were slightly larger on unbrowsed than browsed
   sites. Wyoming big sagebrush utilization (percent leader use) was eight
   times higher (x (\$) over bar = 87 +/- 7.2\% by pronghorns, mule deer,
   and elk) on the low-elevation winter range stratum (the Boundary Line
   Area {[}BLA] portion of the winter range), while mostly mountain big
   sagebrush with leader use averaged only 11 +/- 4.1\% (nearly all by elk)
   on the high-elevation range stratum. In addition, annual aboveground.
   biomass production of big sagebrush did not differ between browsed and
   unbrowsed study sites on the high-elevation stratum of the winter range.
   Population turnover was higher on browsed big sagebrush at the
   high-elevation plots; seedling germination and survival rates were
   higher on browsed. plots versus unbrowsed plots. No difference was
   observed in percent dieback of big sagebrush adult plants between
   browsed and unbrowsed plots at the higher stratum. Browsing did not
   influence the number of leaves or seedstalks per plant (P > .05), but
   leaves averaged 45\% longer and seedstalks 42\% longer on browsed big
   sagebrush. Ungulate browsing, however, apparently suppressed production,
   germination, and survival of Wyoming big sagebrush on the low-elevation
   stratum. Numbers of Wyoming big sagebrush declined 43\% and cover
   declined 29\%, 1957-1900, on browsed sites on the BW. Annual biomass
   production on browsed sites at the low-elevation stratum was only 6-35\%
   that of unbrowsed sites, and big sagebrush recruitment was less on
   browsed sites. Percent leader use of big sagebrush did not differ
   between the period of ungulate reductions, 1962-1969, and the: 1980s on
   the lower stratum ((\$) over bar x = 87\% leader use), but utilization
   was less on higher portions of the winter range during the period of elk
   reductions ((\$) over bar x = 2\%) than during the 1980s following
   cessation of elk controls ((\$) over bar x = 11\%).}},

   active polyps of Hydra vulgaris (Pallas, 1766) strain `'Scotland 1989''
   covering an observation period of 4 years (1989-93). The monitored
   sexually active hermaphrodites and all their asexually generated
   offspring produced gametes in uninterrupted series of individual sexual
   periods, which did not exclude reproduction by budding. Quantitative
   data are given about the investments made by polyps into gametogenesis
   in the course of a sexual period. A growing oocyte incorporates more
   than 10,000 nurse cells (interstitial cells) into the ooplasm by
   phagocytosis. Various observations suggest that male and female gametes
   derive independently from separate predetermined stocks of stem cells
   which are autonomous in their turn from the cell populations committed
   to somatic renewal processes. Only a small number of the fast and slow
   developing embryos survived a critical post-hatching period.}},

Abstract = {{Using soil ventilation to promote in situ biodegradation is a promising
   technology for remediation of unsaturated, hydrocarbon-contaminated,
   subsurface soils. Evaluating in situ hydrocarbon biodegradation rates
   and levels is a critical part of this approach and determining changes
   in subsurface O-2 and/or CO2 levels is a convenient method for
   monitoring this process because repetitive, noninvasive measurements can
   be made. In this study, two rapid held procedures for gas analysis,
   using either liquid- or solid-phase absorption of O-2 and CO2, were
   compared and the implications of these gas measurements for evaluating
   in situ hydrocarbon biodegradation considered. Air samples were taken
   from 5 vadose zone piezometers in a gasoline-contaminated soil under
   treatment by a soil vapor extraction system and one piezometer in a
   noncontaminated background area. Similar rates and levels of O-2
   consumption and CO2 production were obtained by both techniques during
   the 20-d study; thus, the method of choice will depend on factors such
   as cost, air sample volume limitations, or the need for contaminant
   vapor analyses in the field. While these techniques were good assays for
   relative microbial activity levels, significant discrepancies between
   predicted and measured CO2 levels raised questions concerning the
   validity of basing hydrocarbon biodegradation estimates solely on O-2
   consumption data. To improve the reliability of in situ fuel
   biodegradation estimates based on O-2 measurements, the relationship(s)
   between metabolic activities of microbial populations in
   hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, and changes in subsurface O-2 and CO2
   levels should be clarified.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this proposed Phase I field study is to determine the
   distributions of total human exposures to multimedia pollutants in the
   classes of metals, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
   This will be achieved by studying a proportion-based sample of the total
   population in Arizona with a nested design for the different stages of
   sampling. Specific objectives are: (1) to document the occurrence,
   distribution, and determinants of total exposures in the general
   population; (2) to characterize the 90th percentiles of total exposures
   to each pollutant; (3) to monitor geographic and temporal trends of the
   multimedia exposures; (4) to evaluate the different media, personal,
   time-activity, and geographical factors that contribute to current total
   exposure; (5) to evaluate biomarkers in blood and urine for the target
   pollutants; (6) to perform evaluations of relationships between exposure
   reports, environmental measurements, and biomarkers of the target
   pollutants; (7) to predict total exposures; and (8) to assess total
   exposures in minority and disadvantaged subsets of the population. The
   latter is particularly feasible in Arizona due to the large proportions
   of such population subgroups.
   The proportionate-based population sampling of households within blocks
   will occur in Stage 1; the target is 1,200 such households. They will be
   interviewed utilizing National Human Exposure Assessment Survey (NHEXAS)
   questionnaires. In Stage 2, additional questionnaires will be completed;
   environmental sampling will take place in 450-900 households
   representatively selected from the respondents. Environmental sampling
   will include: metals in dust, soil, outside air, and some tap water;
   pesticides in dust, soil, and some tap water; total VOCs in air. In
   Stage 3, a subset of representative households will be reevaluated for
   metals, pesticides, and VOCs using methods with greater resolution and
   reliability; subjects in these households will be asked to complete
   questionnaires and provide biological samples. Follow-up temporal
   evaluations will be performed in a randomly selected subset of homes
   evaluated during this stage.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, the availability of appropriate data to estimate human
   exposures to toxic chemicals is scarce. Consequently exposure
   assessments are often based on indirect surrogates of exposure, such as
   a combination of questionnaire data on time-activities and
   concentrations of toxic chemicals measured in environmental media (e.g.,
   air, water, food, soil, dust). Recent advances, however, make it
   technically feasible and relatively affordable to measure low levels of
   multiple toxic chemicals in accessible human tissues (e.g., blood,
   urine). The increasing availability of biological markers far exposure,
   along with improvements in pharmacokinetic understanding, present new
   opportunities to estimate exposure from human tissue measurements and
   from knowledge of intake and uptake parameters. Biological monitoring
   provides exposure information that is usually complementary to the type
   of exposure information obtained from environmental monitoring.
   Biological and environmental monitoring can be used separately or
   together in order to meet desired objectives. We present here a
   discussion of the value of biological monitoring far improving exposure
   assessment. We emphasize the role of biological monitoring in
   identifying high-priority exposures, evaluating the effectiveness of
   intervention and prevention efforts, identifying at-risk subpopulations,
   recognizing time trends in population exposures, establishing reference
   ranges of tissue concentrations, and providing integrated dose
   measurements.}},

   Florida. Throughout this region, major declines in the abundance of Ae.
   aegypti have been associated with the expansion of Ae. albopictus in
   both urban and rural areas. Generally, the same results have occurred in
   central Florida, but at some urban locations AE. aegypti has remained a
   common mosquito long after the arrival of Ae. albopictus. In
   southeastern Florida, Ae. aegypti is currently the dominant
   container-inhabiting Aedes in urban areas, whereas sites dominated by
   Ae. albopictus are in rural settings or in undeveloped tracts of land
   within urban or suburban areas. At some locations, immature Ae.
   albopictus were found in the same containers with another exotic
   mosquito, Ae. bahamensis Berlin. The persistence of thriving Ae. aegypti

Abstract = {{Personal exposures to ozone were measured in the summers of 1992 and
   1993 in the Fraser Valley, a suburban and rural river valley bordering
   the metropolitan region of Vancouver, British Columbia (population
   approximately 1.8 million). In 1992, two groups of 25 healthy
   individuals were selected for 14 consecutive days of 24-hour personal
   monitoring, based on prior expectations of their activity patterns. The
   first group, composed of adult healthcare workers, was expected to spend
   most of the work day indoors or commuting. The second group, teenage
   camp counselors, was expected to spend more time outdoors. Time-activity
   data were collected to investigate the association between activity
   patterns and ozone exposures. In 1993, 15 adult farmworkers wore
   personal ozone samplers during their workday, which was spent entirely
   outdoors. Personal monitoring was conducted with a nitrite-coated filter
   passive ozone sampler described by Koutrakis and colleagues.(1,2) Ozone
   collection rates were determined empirically by collocation of the
   passive samplers with continuous ozone analyzers at fixed sampling
   sites. Sampler performance was assessed by collecting several duplicate
   personal samples. Although ozone levels were low (<35 ppb 24-hour
   average) during both summer sampling periods, the passive ozone samplers
   agreed well with collocated UV absorption ozone measurements. Based on
   replicate personal samples, we estimated that personal measurements
   differing by more than 35\% were associated with true differences in
   exposure. Within the two groups with varying time activities,
   differences in ozone exposures were associated with the fraction of time
   spent outdoors. Similarly, differences in ozone exposures were observed
   between the three sampling populations, with higher exposures recorded
   in the group that spent more time outdoors. Outdoor ozone exposures were
   estimated to account for 14-35\% of the variability in measured personal
   ozone exposures.}},

Abstract = {{Because visibility bias can confound attempts to detect changes in
   abundance, we evaluated factors that affect visibility rate in aerial
   surveys of wintering waterfowl. We placed waterfowl decoys in 32 2- x
   0.25-km strip transects in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) during
   February 1990 and 1991 and observed the decoys under different
   experimental conditions. Visibility rate was influenced (P < 0.10) by
   habitat, transect width, and decoy group size. We simulated variation in
   use of habitat and found that changes in use between open and wooded
   wetlands would cause changes in visibility rate and affect the power to
   detect a change in abundance. The effect of changes in visibility rate
   on likelihood of detecting population change depended on the magnitude
   and direction of population change and precision of the population
   index. For transect surveys of wintering ducks in the MAV we recommend
   reducing transect width from 250 to 150 m on each side of the aircraft
   and restricting comparisons between years when greater than or equal to
   70\% of the population is likely to be distributed in open wetlands.
   Improved techniques for estimating abundance of wintering waterfowl are
   also needed so use of questionable population indices can be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Managing and conserving uncommon mammals, such as fisher (Martes
   pennanti) and American marten (M. americana), depend upon a reliable
   mechanism to index their populations. In parts of their ranges where
   these species are not commercially harvested, baited track stations
   provide an alternative means to collect data on distribution and
   abundance. Although tracks of many species can be identified using
   unique qualitative traits, distinguishing tracks of these closely
   related, similar-sized mustelids requires a quantitative approach. We
   present a general method to collect mensurative data from track
   impressions on carbon-sooted track plates and use this approach to
   distinguish tracks of fisher and American marten. We used 80 tracks from
   21 individuals to develop a discriminant function that distinguishes
   tracks of adults of each species. The linear combination of 3 variables,
   all associated with the palm (interdigital) pad, correctly classified 95
   (100\%) test tracks. This result makes it possible to positively
   identify both species without using more expensive photographic bait
   stations and will facilitate development of regional survey and
   monitoring approaches for marten and fisher.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive monitoring of the maximum quantum yield of carbon fixation
   phi(max) and of the minimum quantum yield of chlorophyll a in vivo
   fluorescence (phi(Fo)) was followed along the path of drifting buoys in
   the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. Samples were collected
   every third hour during two 24-h periods. Over the 170 measurements,
   phi(max) varied by a factor of 20 {[}from 0.004 to 0.08 mol C (mel
   quanta)(-1)]. As predicted by a model of primary processes in
   photosystem 2, a significant and positive linear relationship was
   observed between phi(max) and phi(Fo). In the estuary, the covariability
   of phi(max) and phi(Fo) seems to be driven by Light, because it was
   observed only during daytime and was characterized by a parallel
   increase of phi(max) and phi(Fo) with depth. Examination of the spectral
   values of phi(Fo) suggests a contribution of photoprotectant
   carotenoids. In the gulf, because a parallel, although weaker, increase
   of phi(max) and phi(Fo) with depth also persisted during nighttime,
   nutrient deficiency is probably an additional cause of covariation
   between phi(max) and phi(Fo). In both regions, an overall diel cycle was
   observed for phi(max) with a maximum at around noon; phi(Fo) did not
   show a clear diel periodicity. Despite the vertical covariability of
   phi(max) and phi(Fo), the diel cycle of phi(max) was uncoupled to
   phi(Fo) and thus to photosystem 2 activity. These results suggest a
   significant diel variation in the photosynthetic quotient of natural
   phytoplankton.}},

Abstract = {{Monitored since 1967, the fish community of the Wabash River main stem
   has experienced increases in most species populations since 1983. Some
   species populations expanded into previously unoccupied areas of the
   river. The average size of an individual has also increased for many
   species, suggesting the possibilities of greater longevity and faster
   growth. The density of carp remained unchanged and gizzard shad declined
   because of increased predator pressure. This improvement probably
   resulted from a combination of long-term, 50\% reduction in BOD loading
   through improved point-source waste treatment and low flow summers in
   1983, 1988, and 1991, which facilitated good reproduction and survival
   through the first year. A 25\% reduction in agricultural loadings to the
   river may have occurred during the 1983 Payment-in-Kind program, which
   paid farmers notto grow crops. Continued improvement may depend upon
   limiting nutrient delivery and reducing diatom densities in the river.
   Many smaller tributaries lost darters, sunfish, smallmouth bass, and
   sensitive minnows during the 1970s through a combination of agricultural
   impacts. However, three summers of drought since 1983 reduced nonpoint
   agricultural pollution and permitted the fish communities of many
   streams to recover, especially in stream systems in which less disturbed
   tributaries served as refugia.}},

Abstract = {{A population of Amphibia inhabiting urban territories was studied for
   more than 10 years (Amphibia, Anura, Ranidae: Rana arvalis, R.
   temporaria, R. ridibunda; Caudata, Salamandridae: Triturus vulgaris;
   Hynobiidae: Salamandrella keyserlingii). During the same period the
   pollution level of water bodies remained the same, but eutrophication
   increased. The abundance and the number of habitats decreased, the
   species ratio and species composition changed, the frequency of
   pathologies increased, the average fecundity decreased, the populational
   phenocharacteristics changed, and some adaptive features appeared that
   may be used in ecological monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Possible causes of the genetic erosion that occurs during the fragmented
   phases of the tree-improvement delivery system are reviewed. The impacts
   of intentional and unintentional directional selection during phenotypic
   selection, seed production (with its associated reproductive-phenology
   asynchrony, fecundity differential and varying propensity to
   inbreeding), seed processing and storage, and seedling production are
   evaluated. In general, genetic diversity and heterozygosity parameters
   of seed orchards are higher or similar to those observed in their
   natural-population counterparts. However, parental contribution to the
   resultant seed orchard seed crops is consistently asymmetrical, and this
   is a major cause of genetic erosion. In most cases, less than 20\% of an
   orchard's clones contribute 80\% of the cone crop, thus reducing the
   effective population size. Because seed germination of coniferous tree
   species is under strong maternal genetic control, the combined effects
   of differences in reproductive output and germination, as well as of
   management practices (e.g., simulated long-term storage of seed showed
   that loss of viability during storage is genotype specific), cause
   unintentional directional selection during seedling production. This
   review confirms the need for genetic monitoring of each phase of the
   tree-improvement delivery system, so that practical solutions can be
   developed to alleviate genetic erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Leafy spurge is a troublesome, exotic weed in the northern Great Plains
   of the United States. Leafy spurge produces showy yellow bracts during
   June that give this weed a conspicuous appearance, A study was conducted
   to determine the feasibility of using remote sensing techniques to
   detect leafy spurge in this phenological stage, Study sites were located
   in North Dakota and Montana, Plant canopy reflectance measurements
   showed that leafy spurge had higher visible (0.63- to 0.69-mu m)
   reflectance than several associated plant species, The conspicuous
   yellow bracts of leafy spurge gave it distinct yellow-green and pink
   images on conventional color and color-infrared aerial photographs,
   respectively. Leafy spurge also could be distinguished on conventional
   color video imagery where it had a golden yellow image response.
   Quantitative data obtained from digitized video images showed that leafy
   spurge had statistically different digital values from those of
   associated vegetation and soil, Computer analyses of video images showed
   that light reflected from leafy spurge populations could be quantified
   from associated vegetation, This technique permits area estimates of
   leafy spurge populations. Large format conventional color photographs of
   Theodore Roosevelt National Park near Medora, ND were digitized and
   integrated with a geographic information system to produce a map of
   leafy spurge populations within the park that can be useful to monitor
   the spread or decline of leafy spurge.}},

Abstract = {{The main questions on the validity of the studies and routine monitoring
   (e.g., in the scope of the WHO/UNEP GEMS programme) assessing exposure
   to chemicals through water and food (i.e., through digestion) relate to
   the following. (a) Sampling: variations due to sampling strategy and
   approach usually exceed analytical errors. (b) Measurement: quality
   assessment and quality control (QA/QC) procedures are essential.
   However, potential limitations of measurement errors resulting from
   implementation of these procedures should be kept in perspective with
   other errors and confounding factors. (c) Methodology: which depends on
   the variability of the intake patterns in the population, as well on the
   adequacy of the information on the consumption of food of a specified
   type as an indicator of the intake of a specific chemical. These factors
   should be considered in particular in studies using `food basket'
   methods. Whenever possible, structure of the population in respect to
   the factors determining typical diet should be registered. (d) Form of
   reporting: limiting possibilities for re-analysis of the exposure
   estimates. In conclusion, the routinely collected data on exposure
   through food and water should be used with care in epidemiological
   studies. Assessment of the exposure conducted specially for the
   epidemiological study should consider possible changes of the diet with
   time. The data on confounders are crucial for exposure estimates.}},

   difficult and expensive to undertake continuous personal exposure
   monitoring in large study groups. The specification of exposures across

Abstract = {{The first census of cliff-nesting seabirds dependent on the resources of
   the Northeast Water polynya was carried out in 1993. We made direct
   counts in six known colonies of the northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis)
   and used a combination of direct and photo counts in one colony of
   black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Glaucous gulls (Larus
   hyperboreus) occurring at these colonies were also surveyed. A total of
   1887 apparently occupied fulmar sites were counted, and a subjective
   attempt to correct for missed sites gave a total of 2550 apparently
   occupied sites, in which an estimated 1475 pairs laid eggs. The cliffs
   at Mallemukfjeld and a neighbouring unnamed cliff held 80\% of the
   fulmar sites. Kittiwakes nested only at Mallemukfjeld, which held 873
   apparently occupied sites in which an estimated 733 pairs initiated
   laying. The minimum glaucous gull population present in the six fulmar
   colonies was estimated at 22 occupied sites. The fulmar and kittiwake
   colonies at the Northeast Water polynya were larger than previously
   assumed. We present estimates based on daily variation in colony
   attendance of the effort required to detect annual differences in
   population size. There is now a basis for evaluating any future
   population changes in some of the most extreme high-arctic seabird
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{When site quality cannot be fully studied, due to lack of time or
   available specialists, the use of particular species as indicators has
   been proposed. However, species which indicate species-richness are
   needed for appreciation of biodiversity, whereas widespread stenotopic
   species are appropriate for habitat quality. Birds are potential
   bioindicators, uniting inherent biological and methodological
   advantages. Birds can only be bioindicators of habitat quality if they
   occur in the same habitat in all the sites under consideration.
   Standard bird counts and captures, and standard measurements of
   habitat-characteristics taken along chosen transects, yield avifaunal
   composition and relative density in pristine and man-changed areas in
   equatorial Africa, in two complex areas situated in the historical
   forest belt (Zaire and Cameroon). The use of these data for
   bioindication was examined. Segregation was found to be highest in
   undisturbed sites within the mosaic of present-day habitats. The present
   study proposes, for this particular region, the use of proportions in
   relative density of four common species among a particular family, the
   bulbuls, which all are well-characterized according to habitat.
   Nevertheless, the authors are fully aware that this indicator cannot be
   extended to other regions.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroduction to the wild of threatened species has become a modern
   additional justification for captive propagation. This conservation
   procedure is costly, and both economic resources and the abscence of
   optimal conditions in the field limit the IUCN recommendations for
   reintroduction to a small proportion of potential candidate species.
   Furthermore reintroduction attempts often fail. In carnivores,
   reintroduction failure is attributed to unsuitable adaptation in the
   field by captive-reared animals, due to their lack of hunting skills,
   their tendency to leave the target area, their inadequate interaction
   with conspecifics or their excessive confidence in humans. This list of
   causes is based on very few studies of carnivore adaptation after
   reintroduction. In very rare and endangered species, monitoring
   individual case-histories is the only way to evaluate reintroduction
   success. We report a successful experimental release of an Iberian lynx
   (Lynx pardinus) which grew up in captivity. Careful feeding-training and
   avoidance of human contact during the captive phase, as well as good
   habitat quality and correct interaction with other wild lynx in the
   release site, seem to account for the observed success. Permanence of
   the lynx within the release area might be related to the availability of
   territory vacancies in the receiving population. Our results allow some
   optimism for future reintroductions of this endangered species in areas
   where it has become extinct recently.}},

   from 1986 to 1993 in the Ghibe valley, south-west Ethiopia. From January
   1991 to December 1993 between 2000 and 4000 cattle were treated at
   monthly intervals with a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, cypermethrin
   (RS-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl {[}IRS]-cis,
   trans-3-{[}2,2-dichlorovinyl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate). An
   approximate dosage of I mi per 10 kg bodyweight was used to control
   tsetse flies (Glossina spp.). Treatments were given as pour-on'
   applications along the backlines of animals, using automatic drench-gun
   applicators. This resulted in a decline of 93\% in the apparent density
   of G. pallidipes Austen. A reduction of 83\% in the apparent density of
   G. morsitans submorsitans Newstead was also observed. This reduction was
   associated with a reduction in trypanosome prevalence in cattle of over
   74\% in 1993, despite a high level of resistance to all available
   trypanocidal drugs. The numbers of Stomoxys spp. (Diptera: Muscidae) and
   Tabanidae were also significantly reduced (P < 0.01).}},

   unsuccessful individuals should relocate if given the opportunity to
   appropriate a higher quality territory. Relocation by these animals,
   however, may be prevented by habitat saturation, poor competitive
   ability, or the costs of relocating. We conducted two removal studies
   that created numerous territory vacancies in a population of the North
   American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), thus providing
   favourable conditions for relocation. In both experiments, we tested
   whether nonbreeding females were more likely to relocate than breeding
   females, presumably because they (the nonbreeders) occupied relatively
   poor-quality territories. In our first experiment we permanently removed
   most of the squirrels from a study site and monitored the relative
   proportions of the remaining nonbreeding and breeding females that
   relocated. In our second experiment we monitored the response of
   squirrels to vacant territories that had been previously held by
   nonbreeding and breeding females, as well as by males. We also monitored
   the behaviour of squirrels that did not hold territories (dispersing
   offspring), as these individuals would not experience the same costs of
   relocation as adults. Our experiments showed that neither category of
   female was likely to relocate, regardless of the type of territory
   available. Both residents and dispersing offspring displayed no biases
   towards vacant territories that previously belonged to nonbreeding or
   breeding females or to males. Relocation does not appear to be a
   strategy for a female in this system to increase her reproductive
   opportunities. This suggests that either territory quality is
   inconsequential or the costs of relocation are prohibitive. Dispersing
   offspring also may be unable to select certain territories because of
   the premium placed on acquiring a territory, regardless of its quality.}},

Abstract = {{The population stability and home ranges of rock doves (Columba livia
   var.) were investigated by means of surveys and monitoring of marked
   individuals. We also studied the population response to removal of
   animals. Pigeons used small home ranges, and there was very little
   exchange between adjacent populations despite their proximity.
   Individual day attendance at the home range was not bimodal, so
   individuals cannot be divided into regular and sporadic visitors. The
   number of individuals remained very stable during the 5 months of the
   study. Pigeons did not show any group cohesion, but individuals simply
   used the same small area. The consequence of the removal experiments was
   a rapid immigration of individuals from areas where no control was
   exerted, supporting the hypothesis that compensatory changes in
   dispersal are probably the main mechanism of pigeons' response to
   external perturbations. The rapid response after control and the
   disappearance of marked pigeons over time indicate the existence of some
   sampling movements of individuals between alternative sites.
   Redistribution of pigeons after the creation of a population vacuum
   would be in accordance with current models of habitat selection.}},

Abstract = {{Twelve unpaired Helmeted Honeyeaters Lichenostomus melanops cassidix
   were radiotracked during the non-breeding season of 1992 to determine
   the extent and nature of their movements. Three of the birds moved away
   from the site where they were resident at the beginning of the study.
   The purpose of these movements may have been to become familiar with the
   local topography before dispersal or to assess breeding opportunities at
   other sites. All three were females aged less than one year. Movements
   of two of these birds were characterised by repeated forays away from
   their natal territories, culminating in dispersal. Additional monitoring
   of movements by sightings indicated that the proportions of birds
   without transmitters and radio-tagged birds which moved were similar. A
   greater propertion of female than male Helmeted Honeyeaters moved during
   the non-breeding season and breeding records from 1984 to 1994
   demonstrated that natal dispersal was female-biased. In small
   populations such as that of the Helmeted Honey eater, sex-biased
   dispersal does not reduce the chances of in-breeding to the same extent
   as it would in large populations. Radiotracking revealed that unpaired
   Helmeted Honeyeaters may move many kilometres from their territories
   over winter and this should be considered when planning management
   strategies for this population.}},

Abstract = {{A nearest-neighbor discriminant analysis based on the frequencies of
   occurrence of six random amplified polymorphic DNA markers was used to
   identify individuals from an insecticide-resistant laboratory biotype
   (SEL) of the walnut aphid parasite Trioxys pallidus after release into
   three California walnut orchards. Releases of SEL individuals were made
   in a Hanford, CA, orchard in 1988 and in a Gridley, CA, orchard in 1989.
   Nearest-neighbor analysis of postrelease collections from both the
   Hanford and Gridley orchards showed a continuing influence of the SEL
   biotype up to 3 yr after the release. SEL individuals also were released
   in a Red Bluff, CA, walnut orchard in 1991. At this orchard, SEL males
   were recovered from the release area throughout the season of release,
   but a June 1992 sample indicated that no SEL individuals remained in the
   orchard. Comparison of observed data at Hanford and Gridley to simulated
   hybrid data provided evidence that there was interbreeding between the
   SEL and the native field biotypes. Bioassays indicated that the level of
   azinphosmethyl resistance in these two orchards was intermediate between
   the level in the orchards before release and the level in the pure SEL
   biotype. Therefore, the release of pesticide-resistant T. pallidus in
   two California walnut orchards significantly increased the level of
   resistance, but did not completely displace the native populations,
   despite multiple treatments of postrelease populations with
   azinphosmethyl.}},

Title = {{THE NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF PUBLIC EXPOSURE TO ARSENIC - A REVIEW OF
   ITS RELEVANCE TO SOUTH-WEST ENGLAND}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{57-82}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In South West England, more than two hundred years of intensive
   exploitation of metalliferous ore deposits, combined with the natural
   processes of pedogenesis from mineral-rich parent rocks, has resulted in
   the creation of a significant area of arsenic-contaminated wastes and
   soils. The scale of arsenic dispersion by natural and anthropogenic
   processes is such that 722 km(2) of land contains concentrations of
   arsenic in excess of 110 mu g g(-1), more than twice the maximum that
   might be expected in a normal soil.
   The general rationale for the clean-up of derelict and contaminated
   mining sites often includes aesthetic factors and the desirability of
   preventing the dispersion of contaminants beyond the site boundaries.
   Only in extreme cases is public health directly invoked as justification
   for remediation. In South West England, if arsenic constitutes a genuine
   threat to the public, an increased rate of site remediation would be
   justified. The primary purpose of this review is to establish whether or
   not widespread arsenic contamination (principally of soils) has any
   measurable effects on public health in South West England, and how this
   might affect current contaminated site remediation policy. The review is
   based on data from previous research in the region, and other relevant
   international studies of mining and smelting communities, and other
   populations exposed to elevated arsenic concentrations. The literature
   reviewed also includes the determination of the extent and sources of
   contamination, and pathways between source and man.
   While the contamination of potable waters in some countries has led to
   measurable health effects, this scenario has not yet been identified in
   South West England, and there is little reason to believe that
   significantly contaminated potable water supplies would escape detection
   for extended periods of time under the current monitoring regime.
   In relative terms (based on both global and local data), one of the most
   significant links between contaminated soils and humans appears to be
   contaminated food stuffs. In absolute terms, such exposure is low due to
   the natural constraints on arsenic uptake by herbage, cereal crops and
   vegetables, and the food chain does not appear to have been
   significantly compromised in South West England. Chronic health effects
   are unlikely as excessive arsenic concentrations in locally grown food
   crops remain rare.
   With the problems of confounding medical and social factors, it is not
   surprising that studies in South West England have failed to identify
   chronic exposure to arsenic at very low concentrations as a significant
   health risk. Those studies that indicate otherwise do not stand up to
   close scrutiny. It appears that the number of additional deaths arising
   from the widespread arsenic contamination in South West England is
   small. The relative benefits of a costly statistical study to actually
   determine the number of additional deaths might be considered minimal,
   but one major area could benefit from further studies: the sensitivity
   of certain population sub-groups to environmental arsenic exposure. Of
   particular interest are children, for whom significant exposure to
   arsenic via soil ingestion may be occurring.
   Based on available information, there appears to be no justification for
   a large programme of site remediation. Resources should, however, be
   expended on enlightening the general public, and private and
   governmental organisations as regards the gap between the perceived and
   actual significance of arsenic contamination in South West England.}},

Abstract = {{The biodegradation of the fuel oil hydrocarbons contained in drilling
   cuttings was studied in soil microcosms during a 270-day experiment.
   Concentration and chemical composition of residual hydrocarbons were
   periodically monitored by quantitative capillary gas chromatography. The
   decrease in hydrocarbon concentration was logarithmic with time. At the
   end of the experiment, the fuel oil was 75\% degraded. In the saturated
   fraction, normal and branched alkanes were almost totally eliminated in
   16 days; 22\% of the cycloalkanes were not assimilated. The aromatic
   fraction was 71\% degraded; some polycyclic aromatics were persistent.
   The resin fraction (10\% of the initial weight) was completely
   refractory to biodegradation. The inorganic part of drilling cuttings
   had no influence on the biodegradation rates of hydrocarbons. Biogenic
   hydrocarbons and traces of degradable fuel oil hydrocarbons were
   protected from microbial activity by the soil and cuttings matrix.
   Enumerations of total heterotrophic bacteria and hydrocarbon-utilizing
   bacteria showed a strong stimulation in both populations.
   Hydrocarbon-degrading strains of bacteria and fungi were isolated and
   identified at the generic or specific level.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid spread of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
   concerns aquatic resource managers in the United States and Canada.
   Since 1990, it has been spreading from the Great Lakes into the
   Northeast. The zebra mussel cannot colonize equally in northeastern
   lakes in part because soft water causes ion exchange and reproductive
   problems when {[}Ca2+] reaches a lower limit of approximately 12 mg/L,
   and pH drops below 7.3. We used (1) an alkalinity map to conservatively
   delineate areas expected to be at low risk for zebra mussel invasion and
   (2) water chemistry data from 344 lakes sampled in the 1991-1994
   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) to estimate
   numbers and surface area of lakes at risk in the Northeast (New England,
   New York, and New Jersey). These lakes were randomly selected from a
   target population of 11,080 lakes > 1 and < 10,000 ha using a
   probability design that allowed inference to all lakes in the. region
   with known confidence. An estimated 25\% (2,770 SE = 410) of lakes in
   the Northeast have {[}Ca2+] > 12 mg/L and could potentially support
   zebra mussel. An estimated 80\% of lakes in high alkalinity areas are at
   risk, while only 5\% of lakes in low alkalinity areas have {[}Ca2+] > 12
   mg/L. The alkalinity map adequately segregated low- and high-calcium
   lakes. State resource managers can use this information to better
   allocate control, monitoring, and education resources.}},

Abstract = {{A survey was conducted to identify the types and relative abundance of
   predatory arthropods associated with Panonychus ulmi in 21 Ohio apple
   orchards. Mite populations were sampled by leaf blushing, and insects
   and spiders were sampled by limb jarring. A state-wide survey was
   conducted in early July and in late August 1992, and five blocks were
   evaluated periodically from May until August 1992 at one farm in central
   Ohio. Predatory mites were detected in only 27\% of the blocks surveyed
   in early July, but in 74\% of the blocks surveyed in late August. The
   ratio of predatory mites to motile P. ulmi was greater than or equal to
   10.1 in 20\% of blocks in July and in 26\% of blocks in August. In
   commercial orchards, the predominant species was Neoseiulus (Amblyseius)
   fallacis (Acari: Phytoseiidae), but Agistemus fleschneri (Acari:
   STigmaeidae) and Zetzellia mall (Acari: Stigmaeidae) were found in
   several blocks. In orchards monitored throughout the season, N. fallacis
   was rarely detected until July, and reached the highest density in
   August when P. ulmi was at a seasonal peak. Important predators of P.
   ulmi that were detected in limb-jarring samples were Stethorus punctum
   punctum (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), green lacewings (Neuroptera:
   Chrysopidae), the black hunter thrips (Leptothrips mall; Thysanoptera:
   Phlaeothripidae), and the insidious flower bug (Orius insidiosus;

Abstract = {{There is at present no routine method for measuring zooplankton
   secondary production in the ocean. Such a method is required, however,
   if we are to be able to estimate the potential productivity of marine
   ecosystems and to quantify food transfer from primary producers through
   mesozooplankton to higher trophic levels. A practical approach, suitable
   for measuring both the production of eggs and the recruitment of
   nauplii, is presented. It is based on the measurement, in a given
   species, of only three variables (E = fecundity of females; B-f =
   biomass of females, and V = hatching success) and is expressed by two
   simple equations: P = E X B-f for production and R = E X B-f V for
   recruitment. Accuracy of this method relies on the number of replicates
   of both E and V, estimated in laboratory or shipboard incubations, and
   on the type of zooplankton sampler used to monitor biomass (B-f) and
   distribution of females in a defined watermass. This approach has been
   applied to Calanus helgolandicus. Although restricted to a fraction of
   the total population production, the method is accurate, operational,
   easy to apply and comparable with parallel measurements of primary
   production at similar scales in time and space. These characteristics
   have never been met by other methods used for estimating pelagic
   secondary production and recruitment. (C) 1995 International Council for

Abstract = {{During the overwintering period Calanus finmarchicus is known to reside
   in deeper waters in high-latitude environments. More recent data
   indicate that the overwintering stages of this species are also found in
   surface water during the winter period. The present article documents
   that overwintering stages CIV and CV are abundant in the uppermost 100 m
   at selected sites in the western part of the Barents Sea, and in
   coastal- and fjord areas in North Norway. The moulting cycle of the
   surface and deep-water dwelling population components was studied by
   using a method for monitoring the formation of the opal teeth on the
   mandibular gnathobase. Although only a limited number of specimens were
   examined, no moulting indices were found out of approximately 300
   specimens examined from November to January. The overall daytime
   vertical distribution pattern in Grotsund appeared to have a fairly
   large component of the population in the uppermost 100 m of depth during
   the entire winter period, differing from the Barents Sea, where a higher
   degree of variability in the vertical distribution of C. finmarchicus
   was found. Physical conditions and trade-offs due to differences in the
   degree of diapause might account for this vertical distribution pattern.
   In Grotsund, the apolysis in stages CIV and CV was found at the
   beginning of February, prior to the onset of ecdysis. The present study
   indicated that apolysis in overwintering generations is more closely
   coupled to ecdysis than shown earlier in C. finmarchicus from the Gulf
   of Maine. (C) 1995 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea}},

Abstract = {{A procedure involving the use of glass vials containing insecticide was
   developed to monitor for resistance to biodegradable insecticides among
   field populations of adult tobacco budworms, Heliothis virescens (F.).
   These insecticides are replacing pyrethroids for the tobacco budworm
   control in areas where pyethroid resistance is a problem. Residues of
   profenofos, chlorpyrifos, methomyl, and endosulfan in glass vials were
   depleted in 2 d when they were held either in daylight or in the dark at
   room temperature. Residues of these compounds remained much longer (>70
   d) in vials held in the freezer. The loss of toxicity was shown to be
   mainly caused by hydrolytic degradation of the insecticide rather than
   to the volatilization. The addition of mineral oil or ethylene glycol
   did not increase the persistence of insecticide residues in glass vials;
   however, addition of an organic acid (benzoic or decanoic) to the vials
   significantly extended stability of insecticide residues. Based on these
   results, treating vials with combinations of insecticides plus benzoic
   acid and storing them in a freezer is the preferred technique if they
   are held for extended periods before use. The usefulness of this
   technique was confirmed by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of
   insecticide residues and by field monitoring data.}},

Abstract = {{Citrus fruits infested with California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii
   (Maskell), and yellow scale, A. citrina (Coquillett), were collected
   from a total of 68 orchards in four counties in the San Joaquin Valley
   of California over three seasons to test for insecticide resistance.
   California red scale populations were collected from Madera, Fresno,
   Tulare, and Kern counties. Yellow scale populations were fewer in number
   and were found only in Tulare County. The results of laboratory
   bioassays of the infested fruit suggest that resistances to the
   organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and methidathion are
   developing in the two armored scale species in this region. Armored
   scale resistance to the carbamate insecticide, carbaryl, appears to be
   less intense than for the organophosphates at this time. The populations
   showing the lowest percentage of mortality to any of the tested
   insecticides were located in eastern Tulare and Kern counties. An
   insecticide resistance management strategy for this citrus growing
   region is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Density estimates are important to investigations of population dynamics
   and the effectiveness of management activities. Methods currently used
   to estimate density of breeding female Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) on
   localized study areas were derived ad hoc and have never been validated.
   The accuracy of ad-hoc estimates was tested by comparing them to
   mark-resight estimates of female density During spring 1993, 61 females
   were color- and radio-marked in southcentral Saskatchewan, and density
   was estimated via ad-hoc and mark-resight methods using data from four
   surveys. The assumptions and minimum data requirements of the
   mark-resight technique were met, and a reliable benchmark estimate of
   density was developed using data from the second survey (3.7
   females/km(2), SE = 0.8). Ad-hoc and mark-resight estimates were
   significantly different (P = 0.046), with the ad-hoc estimate being
   greater by 1.5 females/km(2). For many research and monitoring
   applications, this level of error may be inconsequential, and the ad-hoc
   estimator, which is more easily applied than the mark-resight estimator,
   may be adequate. The mark-resight estimator can be used to provide more
   accurate estimates with measured precision but requires that large
   samples of females be color- and radio-marked, monitored and resighted.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-year study was conducted in field microplots to determine the
   relative importance of soybean phenology and soil temperature on
   induction of dormancy in Heterodera glycines in Missouri. Four
   near-isogenic soybean lines differing for maturity date were planted in
   microplots infested with a race 5 isolate of H. glycines. Soil
   temperature was monitored at a depth of 15 cm. Eggs of H. glycines,
   extracted from cysts collected monthly from each microplot, were used in
   hatching tests and bioassays to determine dormancy. Egg hatching and
   second-stage juvenile (J2) infectivity rates decreased sharply from
   their highest levels in midsummer (July-August) to a low level by
   October of each year and remained low (< 10\% hatching and < 0.2 J2/cm
   root) until May or June of the following year. The patterns of numbers
   of females and eggs in the bioassays were similar. The decreases were
   not related to soil temperature and did not differ consistently among
   soybean isolines. The monophasic changes in all nematode responses with
   peak midsummer rates suggest that H. glycines produces one primary
   generation per year in central Missouri. Changes in hatching rates and
   the timing of minimum and maximum rates suggested that H. glycines eggs
   exhibit more than one type of dormancy.}},

Abstract = {{Blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum (a causative
   organism of paralytic shellfish poisoning) in the Derwent and Huon
   estuaries of southern Tasmania, Australia, are predictable, annually
   recurrent events in the period January to June (late summer to early
   winter). However, their spatial distribution, duration and magnitude
   exhibit significant interannual variability. High shellfish toxicities
   in 1986, 1991 and 1993 (>8000 mu g paralytic shellfish poisoning per 100
   g shellfish meat) also coincided with the greatest spatial extent of
   shellfish toxicity (up to 35 shellfish farms closed for periods up to 6
   months). An exploratory analysis of the results of a shellfish toxin
   monitoring programme conducted from 1986 to 1994, and of available
   hydrological and meteorological data for the region, indicates that a
   significant G. catenatum bloom in Tasmanian waters can only develop
   within a permissive seasonal water temperature window (>14 degrees C at
   the time of bloom initiation) requiring a rainfall event as a trigger
   (Huon River discharge, measured at Frying Pan Creek, must exceed 100 000
   megalitres over a 3-week period) and a calm stable water column for
   sustained development (windspeed <5 m s(-1) for periods of 5 days or
   more). Once established, dinoflagellate populations are subject to
   disturbance by turbulence caused by high windstress; this explains the
   incidence in some years of multiple shellfish toxicity peaks. In winter
   months declining water temperatures (<10 degrees C) and increasing
   windstress are responsible for the termination of seasonal
   dinoflagellate blooms.}},

Abstract = {{Acidic sulfate concentrations were measured in metropolitan Philadelphia
   during the summers of 1992 and 1993, as part of a continuing effort to
   characterize particle concentrations in urban environments. Sampling was
   performed simultaneously at eight sites located within and around
   metropolitan Philadelphia. Sites were selected based on their population
   density and on their distance and direction from the city center. Air
   pollution sampling was conducted every other day during the summer of
   1992 and every day during the summer of 1993. All samples were collected
   for 24-h periods beginning at 9 a.m. (EDT). All acidic sulfate and
   ammonia samples were collected using modified Harvard-EPA Annular
   Denuder Systems (HEADS).
   In this paper, we examine the spatial variation in acidic sulfate and
   ammonia concentrations within the metropolitan Philadelphia area. We
   also identify factors that may influence their variation and develop
   models to predict their concentrations. Outdoor sulfate (SO42-)
   concentrations were uniform within metropolitan Philadelphia; however,
   aerosol strong acidity (H+) concentrations varied spatially. This
   variation generally was independent of wind direction, but was related
   to local factors, such as the NH3 concentration, population density, and
   distance from the center of the city. Physico-chemical models, which
   were developed using data collected during the summer of 1992, were
   excellent predictors of 24-h and mean summertime H+ concentrations
   measured during the summer of 1993. Models accounted for 78\% of the
   variation in 24-h H+ levels. Results suggest that a single stationary
   ambient (SAM) monitor would be sufficient to estimate SO42- exposures
   for populations living in Philadelphia. For H+, however, multiple
   monitoring sites or models should be used to determine the outdoor H+
   exposures of populations Living in urban environments, although a single
   SAM site may provide an excellent index of H+ variation over time.}},

Abstract = {{The present study monitored a fish population before and after fishing
   within a marked area. Visual census counts along transects were used to
   estimate fish abundance inside and around the fishing area. The emperor
   Lethrinus borbonicus made up 64\% of fish in terms of numbers and 44\%
   of the catch in terms of weight. As fishing progressed, the catch per
   unit effort (CPUE) of L. borbonicus declined. Visual census counts of L.
   borbonicus were lower after fishing both inside and outside the fishing
   area. Linear models were used to calibrate CPUE and visual census data
   as indices of abundance to obtain 2 independent estimates of population
   size, which were found to be similar. These estimates further converged
   if the models included an estimate of the immigration rate into the
   fished population. The present study demonstrated that depletion
   experiments provide valuable information on coral reef fish populations,

Abstract = {{Two populations of Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck) (Echinodermata:
   Echinoidea) from the Northwestern Mediterranean were compared to
   ascertain the plasticity and adaptive value of certain biological
   parameters. These populations were found in habitats which differed in
   terms of stability of environmental parameters and food availability. A
   yearly reproductive cycle was seen in both communities, with a spawning
   season at the end of spring that lasted up to several months.
   Recruitment data, inferred from abundance of post-settlement stages,
   indicated lack of settlement during the study period in the unstable
   community, while a major recruitment in summer, with less intense
   episodes occurring until autumn, was recorded in the stable community.
   The intensity of recruitment varied over an order of magnitude in the 2
   consecutive years monitored. The gonadal indices were higher and the
   feeding indices were lower in the unstable community, indicating greater
   allocation of resources to reproduction, at the expense of somatic
   growth, in response to unfavourable conditions. The graph of the feeding
   and gonadal indices with size was parallel in the unstable community,
   while there was a lag between the sizes at which feeding activity and
   gonadal biomass reached their highest values at the stable site,
   indicating that feeding activity is not so tightly determined by gonad
   investment needs in the stable, food-rich community.}},

Abstract = {{We examined survival, behavior, and social interactions of wild
   bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) on release areas, pen-raised bobwhites
   liberated on release areas, and bobwhites on control areas without
   pen-raised bobwhites. We monitored 419 radio-tagged bobwhites
   representing wild release-area, control-area, and pen-raised birds from
   fall to early summer, 1990-1992 in Alabama. Survival of wild bobwhites
   on control sites ((\$) over cap S = 0.929/6 weeks) was higher (P =
   0.004) than wild bobwhites on release sites ((\$) over cap S = 0.665/6
   weeks) before pen-raised birds were released. Survival of all groups
   were compared for 22 weeks post-release; control ((\$) over cap S =
   0.414) and release-area bobwhites ((\$) over cap S = 0.358, P = 0.443)
   did not differ. However, pen-raised bobwhites exhibited lower survival
   rates ((\$) over cap S = 0.178) than control-area (P = 0.001) and
   release-area birds (P = 0.014). The majority of bobwhite deaths in all
   groups were attributed to avian predators. All groups of bobwhites
   exhibited reproductive behavior, and we observed successful cross
   pairing of pen-raised and wild bobwhites. We confirmed that due to low
   survival rates, pen-raised birds are unsuitable for restocking efforts;
   however, their use to supplement harvest may be justified where wild
   bobwhite numbers are low or hunter use is high.}},

Abstract = {{Green turtle fibropapillomatosis (GTFP), characterized by multiple
   benign fibroepithelial tumors on the skin and eyes, has become a growing
   threat to green turtle Chelonia mydas populations worldwide. The cause
   of GTFP is unknown, but a viral etiology is suspected. This study
   investigated whether GTFP could be experimentally transmitted to young
   captive-reared green turtles using cell-free fibropapilloma extracts
   prepared from free-ranging turtles with spontaneous disease. Turtles
   raised from eggs collected from 4 separate clutches in the wild were
   assigned to 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. For each
   experiment a crude homogenate (33\% w/v) was prepared from
   fibropapillomas removed from a free-ranging turtle with spontaneous
   disease. The crude tumor homogenates were freeze-thawed and centrifuged
   to yield cell-free extracts that were used (both filtered and unaltered)
   for inoculation. Recipients were inoculated by intradermal injection or
   by scarification; control turtles were not treated but were housed with
   treated turtles. Fibropapillomas developed in all 12 turtles receiving 3
   of the 4 tumor extracts, and were first detected between 15 and 43 wk
   post inoculation. Both filtered and unfiltered tumor extracts
   successfully induced tumor development. During the 10 and 12 mo
   monitoring periods, fibropapillomas did not develop in control turtles
   or in any turtles inoculated with the fourth tumor extract. Although 2
   sets of experiments were performed 8 wk apart, most of the tumors in
   both sets became evident simultaneously after water temperatures rose.
   Experimental tumors were histologically indistinguishable from
   spontaneous fibropapillomas found in free-living turtles but lacked
   evidence of endoparasites. Scattered foci of epidermal degeneration were
   found in most sections of experimentally induced fibropapillomas and
   within some sections taken from donor turtles. Electron microscopy
   revealed virus-like particles conforming in size, morphology, and
   intranuclear location with herpesvirus. Negative-staining electron
   microscopy of transmission-positive tumor extracts failed to demonstrate
   intact virus particles. This study demonstrates that the etiology of
   GTFP is an infectious filterable subcellular agent. The herpesvirus
   identified in this study is 1 possible candidate for the etiology of
   GTFP.}},

Abstract = {{The common marine mussel Mytilus edulis was used in
   laboratory-controlled experiments to investigate the effects of exposure
   to cadmium on immune capability. Haemolymph was extracted from mussels
   exposed for 7 d to 40 and 400 mu g l(-1) of cadmium, and assays were
   carried out to investigate the potential for immune response. The assays
   included total and differential haemocyte counts, the release of
   intracellular and extracellular reactive oxygen metabolites,
   phagocytosis, release of degradative enzymes and uptake of neutral red.
   Cadmium at 400 pg l(-1) resulted in significantly enhanced numbers of
   circulating haemocytes and increased uptake of neutral red. No
   alteration was demonstrated in proportions of circulating haemocyte
   types, phagocytosis or production of reactive oxygen metabolites. The
   release of degradative enzymes during phagocytosis was found to be
   significantly suppressed at the 40 pg l(-1) cadmium concentration.
   Assays to determine the immune function may provide a sensitive measure
   of the health status of an individual or population under pollutant
   stress. However the variability in effects produced in different aspects
   of immune function emphasises the need for a multi-assay approach to
   monitoring pollution. The observed effects on immunocompetence, at
   environmentally realistic levels of contaminant, support the view that a
   relationship exists between pollution and immunomodulation in aquatic
   organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The densities of benthic vegetation and invertebrate grazers were
   monitored in the seagrass system dominated by Zostera marina L. and
   Zostera japonica Aschers. \& Graebn. in Padilla Bay, Washington.  The
   primary invertebrate grazers included the isopod Idotea resecata
   Stimpson, caprellid amphipods and the gastropod Lacuna variegata
   Carpenter.  Densities of Idotea and caprellids peaked in summer, and
   Lacuna density reached a maximum in winter.  Spatial variation in
   densities was great, and was in the range of four orders of magnitude
   during some seasons.  The mean, experimentally determined, grazing rate
   by Idotea was 0.95 mg dry wt. m-2 day-1.  At this rate, Idotea
   populations alone could remove up to 8 g dry wt. eelgrass m-2 day-1. 
   Based upon (1) high grazer densities, (2) the results of grazing
   experiments, and (3) experiments and observations by others showing the
   significance of caprellids and Idotea, we conclude that herbivory is an
   important process in Padilla Bay.}},

Abstract = {{The spawning activity of the Australian crimson-spotted rainbowfish
   (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) was monitored over a period of nine days.
   After the first three days, groups of rainbowfish were pulse-exposed
   with the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate at one of six nominal
   concentrations (O, 1, 3.2, 10.0, 32.0, or 100 mu g/L). The effects of
   esfenvalerate on fecundity, total hatch, hatchability of eggs, frequency
   of hatch defects, and the survival and growth of subsequent larvae were
   monitored. Hepatic cytochrome P-450 activity (ECOD, EROD, EFCOD) was
   measured six days post-exposure in controls and fish exposed to 32 mu
   g/L esfenvalerate. Cytochrome P-450 activity was also measured in single
   sex populations of male and female rainbowfish similarly exposed. The
   effects of esfenvalerate pulse-exposure on the lymphoproliferation of
   immune cells isolated from spawning and non-spawning groups of
   rainbowfish were examined in a second experiment.
   Over 75\% of fish pulse-exposed to 100 mu g/L esfenvalerate died, and
   males in all treatments were more strongly affected than females. There
   was a negative correlation between pesticide concentration, fecundity,
   and total hatch. All eggs laid in the first three days post-exposure
   failed to hatch in some treatments, although esfenvalerate
   pulse-exposure did not increase the prevalence of deformed larvae.
   Esfenvalerate pulse-exposure significantly increased hepatic ECOD
   activity in male rainbowfish but had no effect on male EROD or EFCOD
   activities. There was no significant effect of esfenvalerate
   pulse-exposure on hepatic EROD, ECOD, or EFCOD activities of female
   rainbowfish. Unstimulated lymphocyte proliferation was lower in treated
   female rainbowfish than non-exposed female fish, and there was some
   evidence of an interaction with spawning activity.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using the Barn Owl (Tyto alba guttata) to monitor
   environmental quality in the Netherlands was investigated, using Cd, Cu,
   Pb, Mn, and Fe as indicators for environmental contamination.
   Throughout 1992, bird-watchers, volunteers, and officials submitted 53
   birds. The age and geographical distribution of these birds formed a
   representative sample of the population. The following
   interrelationships were investigated: cause of death, nutrient reserve,
   age, time of death, place of death, body measurements, sex, condition,
   and heavy metal concentration in kidney, liver, and tibia.
   Twenty-eight animals had died after collisions. Fifteen Barn Owls died
   of exhaustion. In total, twenty-four birds were exhausted, with
   coccidiosis or other parasitic gastrointestinal infections. The
   condition of the birds showed that as the birds' condition worsened, fat
   reserves were depleted before protein reserves. Significant linear
   relationships were found between decreasing protein reserves and
   decreasing dry weights of the liver, kidney, flight muscle and heart,
   but not of the tibia. An asymptotic, nonlinear relation was observed
   between dry organ weight and fat reserve. This suggested that fat
   reserves were only found when protein reserves exceeded 15\% of the body
   mass at starvation. Concentrations of Cu and Fe in liver and kidney rose
   as protein reserves fell; the total content of Cu and Fe per organ,
   however, remained constant. The Mn concentration of these organs
   remained constant; Mn content increased with increasing organ sizes.
   Neither Cd nor Pb showed a clear relationship with parameters of body
   condition. The ratio between the organ content of Pb or Cd and the dry
   organ weight, however, revealed some birds from contaminated habitats.
   The findings suggested that concentrations of environmental contaminants
   Should be measured on a dry weight basis. Furthermore, depending on the
   pharmacokinetic characteristics of a contaminant, the total content of
   that contaminant per organ can be more informative than the
   concentration. In this one year sample of Barn Owls, no indications were
   found of toxic levels of Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, or Fe in the Netherlands.
   It is concluded that the Barn Owl is a suitable biomonitor. Furthermore,
   a network of volunteers can produce an informative sample of the Barn
   Owl population without interfering with the population.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring the seed rain of a species, population, or community is
   important to quantify that component of life history that follows
   anthesis yet precedes establishment in the seed bank or as a seedling. I
   have developed a unique seed trap that is ideal for monitoring the seed
   rain of a grassland community. The trap consists of a 10-cm diameter
   funnel attached by Velcro to one end of a 15-cm long PVC pipe. The trap
   is sunk into the ground with 1.5-2 cm protruding above the soil surface
   to prevent soil and ground-dwelling insects from entering the trap. A
   small cotton bag is attached to the stem of the funnel and acts as the
   reservoir for trapped seeds. I was able to trap propagules ranging in
   size from 0.5-mm seeds (Juncus interior) to >2 cm long awned spikelets
   (Andropogon gerardii). Because this trap minimizes predation, is easy to
   construct and monitor, and is inexpensive, it is superior to traps used
   by previous researchers.}},

Abstract = {{To test the critical short-term predictions of the individual
   optimization hypothesis (IOH), Yellow-headed Blackbird (Xanthocephalus
   xanthocephalus) clutches of three and four eggs were experimentally
   enlarged or reduced by one egg, and broods were monitored until hedging.
   Predictions that control clutches would a) have greater hedging success
   than experimental clutches, and b) produce heavier or bigger offspring
   than enlarged broods were generally not supported. Within control
   clutches, the number of nestlings that fledged did not increase with
   clutch size. In fact, three-egg clutches were more productive than the
   most common clutch size of four eggs. The IOH appears to be unsupported
   for this population, at least up until the time of fledging. We suggest
   a potential insurance value exists for the fourth-laid egg, thus
   explaining the maintenance of a modal clutch size of four eggs in this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of environmental impacts are being subject to greater
   scientific and legal scrutiny than ever before. The application of
   traditional statistical decision-making criteria to questions of
   environmental impacts has become increasingly inadequate as society
   demands greater environmental accountability from economic development.
   In particular, impact assessment has inherited a preoccupation with Type
   I error rates that has pervaded ecological research, even though Type II
   errors are often equally severe in impact assessment. Estimation of Type
   II error rates and specification of critical effect sizes-or the
   magnitudes of impacts considered important-are mutually dependent.
   Consideration of Type II errors, therefore, requires the exact
   specification of an hypothesized impact, which is often difficult.
   Insistence on low rates of Type I error (e.g., alpha = 0.05) typically
   means that equivalent rates of Type II error can be realized only when
   effect sizes (ES) are very large or when very many samples are taken.
   Rather than adhering to a fixed, arbitrary, critical, Type I error rate,
   I propose a procedure by which the critical ES is given primacy.
   Statistical decision criteria are then selected according to the
   relative weighting of the perceived consequences of Type I or Type II
   errors. The critical Type I error rate is set by iteration to some
   multiple (k) of the estimated potential for Type II error, and the null
   hypothesis is rejected if that (variable) Type I probability is not
   exceeded. The value of k would be determined by the ratio of the
   consequences (e.g., costs) of Type II and Type I errors. The procedure
   focuses attention on the magnitudes of impacts considered important, and
   provides for statistical decisions based on the a priori consideration
   of the development and environmental costs of Type I and Type II errors.
   It also provides incentive for development proponents to support
   rigorous environmental monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Water, nitrogen, and water-plus-nitrogen at levels beyond the range
   normally experienced by shortgrass steppe communities were applied from
   1971 through 1975, plant populations were sampled through 1977, and the
   results of the experiment were published. Upon revisiting the plots in
   1982, we found it apparent that large changes had occurred since 1977.
   Sampling was re-established in 1982 to follow trajectories of recovery.
   Our purposes in this paper are to examine how conclusions from this
   study changed through time, and discuss implications of these changes
   for monitoring potentially stressed ecosystems.
   Although productivities increased, dissimilarities in plant species
   composition at the end of the 5 yr of nutrient treatments were not
   significantly different from controls. Two years after cessation of the
   treatments exotic `'weed'' species were increasing in
   water-plus-nitrogen treated communities, and community dissimilarities
   were diverging in water and water-plus-nitrogen treated communities.
   Seven years after cessation of treatments all communities were
   significantly different from controls. Exotics were more than ten times
   more abundant in water-plus-nitrogen and nitrogen treated communities
   than they had been 2 yr post-treatment. A consistent trend in recovery
   of all treated communities was evident over the next 5 yr. However, the
   trend towards recovery reversed over the next four consecutive years in
   the previously water-plus-nitrogen and water treated communities. The
   four-to-five year cycles in species composition and abundance of exotics
   towards, and then away from, conditions in undisturbed control
   communities were not related to weather but large accumulations of
   litter suggested biotic regulation.
   Inertia of existing plant populations, or the tendency to continue to
   occupy a site when conditions become unfavorable, can mask both future
   deterioration in ecosystem condition and unstable behavior resulting
   from environmental stressors. Time lags in initial response means that
   an ecosystem can pass a threshold leading to transitions to alternate
   states before it is evident in structural characteristics such as
   species composition. Global climate change and sulfur and nitrogen oxide
   pollutants also have the potential to act as enrichment-stressors with
   initial time lags and/or positive effects and cumulative, subsequent
   negative effects, rather than as disturbance forces with immediate
   negative impacts. Sociopolitical systems, however, often require change
   in biological variables or negative impacts before acting to ameliorate
   environmental problems. The manner in which conclusions changed at
   various periods in time, and the potential for time lags in responses of
   species populations, raises questions about which variables are most
   useful for detection of stress and how long studies must last to be
   useful.}},

Abstract = {{1. Unlike most parasitoids, tachinid flies of the tribe Ormiini use
   sound to locate their hosts. Although thought to exert selection
   pressure on their host's calling behaviour, little is known about the
   biology of ormiines. Accordingly, this study reports the biology and
   impact of the ormiine Homotrixa sp. upon calling males of the univoltine
   bushcricket Sciarasaga quadrata Rentz in south-western Australia.
   2. Populations of adult S.quadrata were monitored in the field over two
   successive calling seasons. Females, which do not call, were not
   parasitized by Homotrixa sp., but the risk of parasitism for males
   increased as the 3-month calling season progressed. Parasitism did not
   commence until c. 2 weeks into the calling season, but by the end of the
   season up to 87\% of surviving males were parasitized.
   3. Parasitized males lived for 14 days and were found singing until
   their penultimate evening before death in the field. Unparasitized males
   lived on average 69 days and a maximum of 119 days.
   4. Multiparasitism of hosts was common, with up to sixteen fly larvae
   found within parasitized males. The number of fly larvae within hosts
   significantly increased at the end of the season. However, successful
   emergence of fly larvae from hosts, as well as pupal size, significantly
   decreased as more than one fly larva developed within the host.
   5. Homotrixa sp. has a long pupal duration of 30-31 days at 20 degrees
   C. As a consequence, only one complete fly generation, which overwinters
   in the pupal stage, is likely within each host generation.
   6. No evidence for differential (size-bias) mortality by Homotrixa sp.
   on male S.quadrata was found. The size of parasitized and unparasitized
   males collected in the field was not significantly different.
   7. It is concluded that Homotrixa sp. is a significant mortality factor
   acting on the survival of adult male S.quadrata.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic spatial model of tropical deforestation and land-use change
   was developed from remotely sensed data for the Fouta Djallon mountain
   range in the Republic of Guinea, West Africa. The objective was to
   simulate patterns of forest clearing for shifting cultivation in terms
   of farmers' selection behavior for new fields based on topography and
   proximity to villages. Data describing the current and historic
   condition of the vegetation cover and land use for a watershed in Guinea
   were derived from aerial photography and ground sampling. Maps of these
   conditions were prepared and entered in a geographic information system
   (GIS) together with topographic data. From these data, maps of secondary
   variables (slope, village proximity, site productivity, and labor) were
   derived using the spatial operators contained in the GIS. These
   variables were ranked for agricultural preference and then combined
   following a pair-wise hierarchy to generate a composite agricultural
   site-preference map. Shifting agriculture was simulated by running the
   model through 18 iterations on a two-year time increment which
   corresponds to the typical duration of cultivation for any one field. An
   empirically derived number of cells from the agricultural
   site-preference map were converted from forest to active farms for each
   iteration to simulate deforestation. Different variable combinations and
   underlying assumptions of model logic were tested to determine influence
   on simulation results. To validate the model, the spatial
   characteristics of the projected landscape were compared with land-use
   data collected in 1989, using tests for (1) size and distribution of
   agricultural sites, (2) image similarity (Kappa test), and (3) physical
   characteristics (slope and distance from population centers) of the
   site. Although the model did not simulate the farmers' selection
   behavior for topography and village proximity successfully, test results
   with individual variables suggest that site productivity as determined
   by the length of fallow is a critical variable in the site selection
   process. Thus, aside from documenting the dynamics of shifting
   cultivation, this model allows planners to evaluate alternative
   strategies of land-use conversion with a graphic display of zones of
   potential hazards. Finally, the data contained in the GIS serve as a
   structure for monitoring long-term change in the region.}},

   broccoli (Brassicae oleracea var. botrytis {[}L].) interplanted with
   leguminous cover crops (cover crop background) or broccoli grown as
   monoculture (bare soil background), and fertilized with compost or
   synthetic fertilizer. Alate Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) and Myzus
   persicae (Sulzer) (Homoptera: Aphididae) were monitored in yellow pan
   water traps and on broccoli leaves. Reflectance intensity was higher
   with a background of bare soil at all wavebands except blue (400-455 nm)
   in the early-season. Intensity decreased as broccoli canopy cover
   increased at all wavebands except blue and green (515-550 nm),
   declining-most dramatically in the yellow (550-590 nm). Highest
   late-season intensities were in plots with bare soil background and
   fertilized with compost (those stressed for nitrogen). Few differences
   in spectral composition, expressed for each waveband as a percentage of
   total intensity, were recorded. Numbers of alatae were lowest in cover
   crop background plots in the early season, reached equivalency with bare
   soil background by mid-season, and showed highest positive correlations
   with intensity in the yellow (550-590 nm). Results correspond to
   laboratory findings that aphids are attracted to higher intensity light,
   especially in the yellow waveband, and support a phototactic explanation
   for aphid orientation in the field.}},

   operations (target population), who are potentially exposed to toxicants
   from mining waste, have increased genotoxic effects compared with people
   residing elsewhere (reference population), Population surveys were
   conducted, and 24 target and 24 reference residents were selected. The
   selected subjects and controls were matched on age and gender and they
   were nonsmokers. Blood samples were collected for laboratory studies,
   The standard cytogenetic assay was used to determine chromosome
   aberration frequencies, and the challenge assay was used to investigate
   DNA repair responses. We found that individuals who resided near uranium
   mining operations had a higher mean frequency of cells with chromosome
   aberrations and higher deletion frequency but lower dicentric frequency
   than the reference group, although the difference was nor statistically
   significant. After cells were challenged by exposure to gamma-rays, the
   target population had a significantly higher frequency of cells with
   chromosome aberrations and deletion Frequency than the reference group.

Abstract = {{A high degree of spatial variation in Nephrops size, female maturity and
   sex ratio was observed. Disaggregated total catch size frequency data
   for male Nephrops from the western Irish Sea are described for the
   period 1968-1990. Temporal variation is discussed by reference to
   sub-areas of ICES rectangles in an attempt to look for long-term trends
   within different parts of the Irish Sea. The data showed that if
   localised temporal change has occurred it is probably masked by spatial
   variability. Because of this spatial variability within rectangles the
   data are pooled from all rectangles in order to reduce the variance and
   so give an overall view of the western Irish Sea stocks. Despite this
   treatment no temporal trend in mean size was apparent. The stable sex
   ratio observed in temporal data is tabled as evidence of stock
   stability, though it is emphasised that the situation should be
   carefully monitored in view of the high fishing effort on Irish Sea
   Nephrops.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect sampling methods for pocket gophers (Family: Geomyidae) lack

   trials in forest clearcuts, our new `'burrow index'' accounted for 95\%

   only 68\%. Using published data, we found that mound counts and plot
   occupancy provided precise estimates (R(2) = 0.76 - 0.99) of gopher
   density in clearcuts. We recommend the more efficient `'burrow index''
   for sampling gophers, and `'effective depopulation'' for estimating
   population change due to abatement, after accounting for natural
   population dynamics in `'control'' plots. A modified burrow index on
   strip transects can be used for measuring association of gophers with

Abstract = {{1. Seed input, changes in the seed bank and seedling recruitment of
   Onopordum were monitored over 1 year at three contrasting sites
   (pasture, oat crop and hillside) within an 80-hectare paddock at Galong,
   New South Wales, about 100 km NW of Canberra. Each site was c. 2000
   m(2). Time constraints precluded a longer study and repetition of the
   sampling procedures at similar sites in other areas.
   2. In the pasture there were few Onopordum plants but a seed bank of c.
   5000 seeds m(-2). During the year the seed bank decreased by more than
   half, but the most dormant component remained constant at c. 800 seeds
   m(-2).
   3. In an oat crop nearby there were no flowering Onopordum plants and
   there was no direct seed input. Nevertheless, the seed bank of c. 700
   seeds m(-2) did not decrease.
   4. At the third site, a grazed hillside, Onopordum density was high (19
   plants m(-2)). The seed input of 1788 seeds m(-2) caused a temporary
   small increase in the seed bank in summer but there was no change over
   the 1-year period either in the total seed bank (c. 3000 seeds m(-2)) or
   in its most dormant component (c. 750 seeds m(-2)).
   5. Seedlings appeared in all seasons, invariably after rain. More than
   95\% of seedlings appeared in late summer or autumn, but different
   management practices changed the pattern of winter establishment.
   6. For ecological studies of weeds, the population dynamics of the seeds
   in the soil and of the plants above ground are equally significant. This
   study shows that the existence of a small pool of labile seeds (c. 15\%
   minimum) in the seed bank that can be recruited opportunistically,
   together with a large, strongly persistent component, will make any form
   of short-term control difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Forest canopy change information over two-, four-, and six-year periods
   was extracted digitally from multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)
   imagery over a 415 km(2) area in north central Minnesota. This paper
   discusses the complementary character of the pixel-based change
   information with respect to stand-based data that traditionally have
   provided the foundation for management prescriptions.
   Change maps generated from TM data, and change overlays created from
   traditional stand maps updated with aerial photography, were
   site-specifically cross-verified using contingency matrices and
   geographical information system (GIS) modeling, supported by intensive
   held verification. It was demonstrated clearly that a majority of the
   so-called digital change classification inconsistencies were not errors,
   but embodied a powerful source of sub-stand information with the
   potential to significantly impact the sustainability of the resource
   management. While the pixel approach does not directly encompass the
   stand concept (stand representing the actual management unit),
   qualitative and quantitative data on change at the stand level could be
   readily extracted from the TM imagery, provided pre-change stand
   information was available. For example, for the six-year monitoring
   cycle, 714 out of 759 stands identified as `'changed'' (canopy depletion
   or increment) in the traditional stand maps were also digitally
   classified as such, whereby change was detected in at least 75\% of the
   pixels which made up the stands. New information being made available to
   the resource manager ranged from location and areal extent of sub-stand
   changes, e.g. trespasses, flooding, insect infestations, and
   species-specific dieback, to the detection of local failures in tree
   establishment and/or population development.}},

Abstract = {{With a continued increase in the range of transgenes, and plant species
   for which genetic modification is possible, this review attempts to
   bring together some of the factors that will influence the eventual fate
   of transgenes in the environment, and the effects that such a dispersal
   may have. The review is developed from papers presented at the SEE
   Swansea meeting (April, 1994).
   Using experiments with GM (genetically modified) plants, and markers in
   non-GM plants, as well as observations on natural and crop populations,
   it is possible to predict isolation distances required for limiting the
   unintentional release from GM crops, and the probable fate of both GM
   pollen and seed if it is released beyond the GM plot, Knowledge of wild
   relatives of crop plants, and ecological mechanisms can also give
   insights into the possible effects of different transgenes on native
   plants, and other agricultural crops. A large number of limited scale
   releases of GM plants have now taken place from which we can gain
   information on the performance of GM crops in an agricultural
   environment, and the stability of the GM phenotype. All this
   information, can help to form a sound basis for regulations on the
   release of GM plants, an assessment of the need for, and scope of
   monitoring, and the best way in which to use GM crops.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the first occurrence in Atlantic Canada waters of `'bitter
   crab disease'' in the snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio. The condition is
   caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate, Hematodinium sp. Male crabs held
   in captivity harbored vegetative, prespore, and dinospore stages.
   Incidence of the disease was low (=<0.11\%) off the eastern and
   northeastern coasts of Newfoundland in 1992-1993, except in Conception

Abstract = {{Individual isolates (in total 4040) of Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei
   were collected between 1989 and 1991 in fields of spring barley
   varieties with resistance genes Mla9, Mla12 and Ml(La) in the local air
   spora, i.e. remote from barley fields, in Hesse, Germany. Their
   virulence pattern was determined on a 13-partite differential set. In
   the air spora, virulence complexity (the number of Virulence genes per
   isolate) increased by 30\% (4.2 vs. 5.5) between 1989 and 1991. This was
   mainly due to an increase of pathotypes with virulence genes Va7, Va13,
   Vk and V(La). In each mildew field population, frequencies of several
   non-corresponding virulence genes, e.g. V(La) on Mla9 variety, greatly
   increased during the period. Such change can be caused by hitchhiking
   selection, i.e. indirect selection resulting from asexual reproduction,
   and direct selection by non-corresponding resistance genes. To separate
   the two effects, the aerial barley mildew population of 1991 was sampled
   on cv. Pallas and near-isogenic lines of Pallas. Frequencies of
   non-corresponding virulence genes as observed in samples from the
   near-isogenic lines were compared to expected non-corresponding
   virulence frequencies which were obtained by subdividing the sample on
   Pallas into 12 subsamples, comprising all isolates virulent to line 1
   through 12, respectively. Among 90 resistance/virulence gene
   combinations selection for non-corresponding Virulence was significant
   in five cases (e.g. Va9 on Mla7 host) and against non-corresponding
   virulence in nine cases (e.g. Vk on Ml(La) host). Hitchhiking selection
   was significant in eight cases. In 11 cases the two types of selection
   were significant in combination but not individually. It is suggested to
   monitor the stability of selection against non-corresponding virulence
   genes in race surveys and utilize it in diversified barley crops such as
   variety mixtures in order to retard the evolution of complex races.}},

Abstract = {{In the eastern English Channel (a coastal and shallow system),
   photosynthetic parameters of the phytoplankton population were measured
   during 36 h at four depths, in a neap tide period. The vertical
   distributions of chlorophyll a (chl a), nutrients, and hydrodynamic
   properties were monitored during the cruise. Despite vertical
   homogeneity in salinity, chlorophyll a and nutrient profiles, a vertical
   gradient in both photosynthetic parameters (P-MAX(B) and alpha(B)) and
   in vivo fluorescence/chl a ratios was observed. Photosynthetic
   adjustment occurred in the water column: low vertical current shear at
   mid-depth favoured shade adaptation of phytoplankton, as compared to the
   photoinhibited cells in the upper layer. This was consistent with the
   observed similar light saturation parameters on vertical profiles,
   suggesting the presence of shade-type phytoplankton. Synchronous
   circadian variations were observed in both photosynthetic capacity
   (P-MAX(B)) and in vivo fluorescence/chl a ratios. Estimates of daily
   primary production, computed with and without the observed daily and
   depth variability in P-MAX(B) and alpha(B), showed large differences
   (from -40 to +33\%) between them. The strong light penetration in the
   water column, the photoadaptation processes occurring at neap tide and
   the presence of shade-type phytoplankton (prymnesiophytes) could be
   major factors inducing a high daily rate of 2.1 g C m(-2) day(-1).}},

Abstract = {{A 4-year study was conducted on Kansas Flint Hills bluestem range to
   monitor animal gain, grass, and forb standing biomass following grazing,
   plant population dynamics, and in 2 years, subsequent feedlot
   performance of steers under intensive-early stocking supplemented with
   increasing levels of sorghum grain. Each year from 1988 through 1991,
   crossbred beef steers were stocked at 0.24 ha/100 kg of initial steer
   weight from 5 May to 15 July. Steers in twice-replicated pastures were
   given no supplementation, 0.91 kg rolled sorghum grain per head daily,
   or 1.82 kg rolled sorghum grain per head daily, which corresponded to
   approximately 0, 0.3, and 0.6 of body weight(-1). All steers were
   implanted with estradiol 17 beta in 1988 and zeranol in 1989-91 during
   initial processing and had unlimited access to a lasalocid/mineral
   mixture during the entire trial. In 1989 and 1990, representative groups
   of steers selected from all treatment/pasture combinations were
   subjected to a feedlot finishing phase and carcass data were obtained.
   Grass and forb standing crops were estimated each year at livestock
   removal in mid-July and again in early October. Pretreatment species
   composition and basal cover were determined in 1988 and compared to
   those at the end of the study. In mid-July, when cattle mere removed,
   residual standing biomass of grass increased in direct proportion to
   increasing level of supplement. Standing biomass of grass at the end of
   the growing season did not differ among pastures with different
   supplement levels, Forb standing biomass did not differ among pastures
   with different supplement levels in July or October. Changes in plant
   populations among treatments during the course of the study were
   minimal. During the early portion of the grazing period, sorghum grain
   supplementation did not significantly influence steer gains, but average
   daily gain during the latter part of the grazing period increased in
   direct proportion to increasing level of sorghum grain supplement. Daily
   gain, feed intake, carcass characteristics, and gain:feed ratio were not
   different among treatments during the feedlot phase. Although conversion
   efficiencies may be economically marginal, low-level grain
   supplementation has the potential to increase the daily gain of tattle
   grazing early-season tallgrass prairie under an intensive-early stocking
   program.}},

Abstract = {{The responses of Gelidium sesquipedale productivity, photosynthetic
   efficiency and respiration to changes in light and temperature were
   measured on plants acclimated to different light/temperature
   combinations simulating average winter and summer conditions at 2
   different depths. Photosynthetic efficiency was reported relative to
   frond surface area computed by a method described in this study. Algal
   pigment contents were monitored during acclimation. Results suggest that
   seasonal acclimation to light and temperature may have a significant
   effect on photosynthetic efficiency and on the dependence of
   productivity on light and temperature. This effect may be the opposite
   of what is generally expected from acclimation to photon flux density
   alone but is in good agreement with previously reported results
   indicating an increase in photosynthetic efficiency in plants grown at
   higher temperatures. There is some evidence that temperature adaptation
   may compensate light adaptation through changes at physiological levels
   other than the pigmentary system. Significant seasonal effects on
   respiration, as well as a strong temperature dependence, are apparent.
   Winter acclimated plants had higher respiratory rates than summer
   acclimated ones. Among the former, plants acclimated to the greater
   depth exhibited lower respiratory rates than those acclimated to the
   shallower depth, which is an important adaptation for surviving under
   low light conditions by reducing energetic losses. The compensation
   photon flux density values obtained in this work for G, sesquipedale
   suggest that during winter the average net photosynthesis may be
   negative for a significant part of its subtidal populations.}},

Abstract = {{The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins associated with PS II (LHC
   II) are often considered to have a regulatory role in photosynthesis.
   The photosynthetic responses of four chlorina mutants of barley, which
   are deficient in LHC II to varying degrees, are examined to evaluate
   whether LHC II plays a regulatory role in photosynthesis. The
   efficiencies of light use for PS I and PS II photochemistry and for CO2
   assimilation in leaves of the mutants were monitored simultaneously over
   a wide range of photon flux densities of white light in the presence and
   absence of supplementary red light. It is demonstrated that the
   depletions of LHC II in these mutants results in a severe imbalance in
   the relative rates of excitation of PS I and PS II in favour of PS I,
   which cannot be alleviated by preferential excitation of PS II. Analyses
   of xanthophyll cycle pigments and fluorescence quenching in leaves of
   the mutants indicated that the major LHC II components are not required
   to facilitate the light-induced quenching associated with zeaxanthin
   formation. It is concluded that LHC II is important to balance the
   distribution of excitation energy between PS I and PS II populations
   over a wide range of photon flux densities. It appears that LHC II may
   also be important in determining the quantum efficiency of PS II
   photochemistry by reducing the rate of quenching of excitation energy in
   the PS II primary antennae.}},

Abstract = {{We show that temporal variability in root populations can depend upon
   the scale of measurement (particularly the sampled soil volume), The
   presence of roots in a range of volumes of soil was studied using
   perspex tubes installed horizontally into the soil around three mature
   kiwifruit vines, Roots intercepting lines scored on the tubes were
   counted using a periscope, For small volumes of soil (c.2.4cm(3)) the
   root counts varied with time in a very irregular manner, and as the
   interval between measurements increased the autocorrelation between the
   measurements decayed rapidly, At about half of the locations monitored
   there was no significant autocorrelation between measurements 27d apart,
   Linear interpolation in these time series was unreliable, and where the
   correlation dimension could be resolved it was usually non-integer
   (suggesting chaotic behaviour), The time series measured at different
   locations were poorly correlated, indicating weak coordination, As the
   observed soil volume Increased, the coordination between locations
   improved, the autocorrelation function increased, and linear
   interpolation errors decreased (although these remained substantial),
   Clearly there are considerable fundamental constraints on our ability to
   predict the root behaviour of kiwifruit vines at scales that are
   appropriate for mechanistic models of nutrient and water uptake, We
   discuss the need for a new conceptual model of the fine-root systems of
   kiwifruit and similar species.}},

Abstract = {{Sclerotinia homoeocarpa is an important turfgrass pathogen on golf
   courses in Michigan and Ohio. Isolates were collected from golf courses
   on which sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides had never been
   used and from courses where DMI fungicides were used but where little or
   no control of dollar spot was achieved. The mean relative growth value
   on DMI-amended media of 150 isolates from golf courses treated with DMI
   fungicides was two to three times higher than for 150 isolates from golf
   courses with no history of DMI treatments. Isolates with high relative
   growth values for triadimefon also had similarly high values for
   fenarimol and propiconazole. The difference in growth on DMI-amended
   media of the S. homoeocarpa isolates from untreated courses compared to
   treated courses indicated that resistance to DMI fungicides had
   developed. Dollar spot control on a golf course in southeast Michigan
   infected by DMI-resistant S. homoeocarpa was not obtained with
   triadimefon, fenarimol, or propiconazole. Chlorothalonil applied at 191
   ml/100 m(2) was the only chemical that provided acceptable disease
   control for the duration of the study (1991 through 1993). A triadimefon
   concentration of 2 mu g ml(-1) was an effective monitoring dose for S.
   homoeocarpa populations.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the predatory ostracod Australocypris insularis on
   zooplankton abundances and species composition in an Australian saline
   lake was monitored over 8 months in aquaria and tank microcosms. 
   Control, Predator (double A. insularis Control densities) and No
   Predator (all A. insualris removed) treatments were set up in small 11.5
   l aquaria and large 883.5 l tanks.  Microcosm salinities were
   manipulated to accord with seasonal lake salinities and ranged from 35
   to 110 g l-1.  Densities of the calanoid copepods Calamoecia clitellata
   and C. salina, the small ostracods Diacypris compacta and D. dietzi, and
   juvenile ostracods (excluding A. insularis) were significantly reduced
   by A. insularis predation in the aquaria experiments.  Daphniopsis sp.
   was only present (in low numbers) in the No Predator aquaria.  Results
   from the large tank experiments were not as clear-cut, due to
   difficulties in the manipulation of predator numbers.  Differing
   salinity tolerances of predator and prey may confound the predation
   impact of A. insularis.}},

Abstract = {{Levels of total mercury were determined in body feathers of 257 seabirds
   belonging to seven species from the Azores Archipelago, Mid-North
   Atlantic Ocean. Mercury levels in adult birds showed highly significant
   inter-specific variations. Median levels were higher in small petrels
   (Madeiran storm petrel = 12.5 mu g/g; Bulwer's petrel = 22.1 mu g/g)
   than in shearwaters (Little shearwater = 2.1 mu g/g; Gory's shearwater =
   6.0 mu g/g) and terns (Roseate tern = 2.0 mu g/g; Common tern = 2.3 mu
   g/g). Such inter-specific variability is discussed in relation to
   biological factors that may influence mercury dynamics in birds.
   Intra-specific variations in mercury levels were also found. Mercury
   levels were significantly lower in chicks than in adults of Gory's
   shearwater, Roseate tern and Common tern. The levels in chick feathers
   were 60-70\% of those in adult feathers. In Gory's shearwater and the
   terns (Roseate and Common combined), mercury levels decreased
   significantly with increasing age of chicks. Mercury levels in adult
   Madeiran storm petrel showed pronounced seasonal variation, being about
   50\% lower in Spring breeders than in Autumn breeders. Mercury levels
   are compared with levels reported for seabird populations of the same or
   related species, from a variety of regions. The use of bird feathers to
   monitor mercury in the marine environment is briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Phlox idahonis is a narrow endemic known from four metapopulations in
   north-central Idaho. Due to its extreme rarity, past habitat loss, and
   ongoing disturbances, Phlox idahonis is a candidate for listing under
   the Endangered Species Act. Seven permanent plots were established in
   mountain meadows containing Phlox idahonis in 1978 and resampled in
   1993. Direct gradient analysis of vascular plant cover data indicated
   that livestock grazing intensity explained a majority of the Aoristic
   variation in the plots. Two secondary variables, physiognomic meadow
   type and soil water content, explained much of the remaining variation.
   Ramet density for all plots over the 15-year monitoring period indicated
   that Phlox idahonis remained stable. There were, however, significant
   intersample differences. Ramet density increased in one plot for
   unexplained reasons and decreased in another, probably resulting from
   post-fire succession at this plot. Phlox disappeared completely from one
   plot. Ramet density and vegetation composition and structure data
   suggest that intense livestock grazing caused the disappearance. Our
   results indicate that no grazing and moderate levels of grazing are not
   detrimental. We recommend that all populations be protected from further
   direct habitat loss, grazing be excluded from heavily grazed meadows to
   facilitate recovery, and permanent plots be sampled every five years.}},

Abstract = {{The autumn calfcow ratio of a remnant Caribou herd in Gaspesie Park,
   Quebec, declined from approximate to 20-30 calves per 100 females in
   1984-1985 to only four in 1987, after Coyotes colonized the area. Twenty
   adult female Caribou were radiotagged in November of the same year, and
   examination of blood samples and vaginal swabs did not detect diseases
   likely to affect fecundity. The following spring, 13 of 19 (68\%)
   radio-collared Caribou were observed to be followed by a calf at the
   time of parturition, but only one neonate survived until the following
   autumn. In 1989 and 1490, 25 radio-tagged calves were monitored and 16
   of them died in the course of the summer. Likely cause of death was
   determined for 11 cases and suggested that Coyotes were responsible for
   7 deaths, Black Bears for 3 and Golden Eagle for 1. The mortality rate
   of neonates was higher for the Caribou group inhabiting the eastern
   portion of the park than for the other group which used the centre of
   the park. Calves surviving until autumn exhibited low mortality during
   their first winter of life: 8 of 9 survived this season during three
   winters. Between 1987 and 1992, annual survival of adults exceeded 0.90
   on average; most deaths occurred during the harsh winter of 1990-1991,
   and Coyote predation was possible in a maximum of two of six cases.
   Predators were reduced in the park and surroundings between 1990 and
   1992 in order to improve calf survival. Recruitment was sufficient to
   replace mortality after 1988 for the Caribou group occupying the centre
   of the park, but it remained at about 10 calves:100 females until 1992
   for the group inhabiting the eastern part of the park, at which time
   calf survival finally improved.}},

Abstract = {{To test the response of the freshwater bivalve Pyganodon grandis
   (formerly Anodonta grandis) to increased metal exposure in the field, we
   transferred specimens (8 cm length; 4-6 years old) from a less to a more
   contaminated lake in the mining area of Rouyn-Noranda, in northwestern
   Quebec. The transplanted bivalves were maintained in open enclosures
   placed in the bottom sediments of the contaminated lake. Up to 16
   individuals were removed from pairs of enclosures at times t = 0 (June
   1990), 5, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 400 d; tissue concentrations of
   metallothionein (MT) and metals were monitored over time. Measurements
   on control molluscs enclosed in their lake of origin showed that
   enclosure per se had no apparent effect on tissue {[}MT] or tissue metal
   levels, but did decrease shell growth. Metallothionein levels in
   specimens transplanted to the more contaminated lake showed a slow but
   steady increase with time; in contrast, MT levels in the control
   populations showed only modest seasonal fluctuations. The increase in MT
   over time in the transplanted bivalves was closely correlated with a
   similar slow increase in soft tissue {[}Cd]. We conclude that MT in the
   freshwater bivalve P. grandis is a promising biochemical indicator of
   metal exposure.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the extent and impact of predation on red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) during a cyclic decline of snowshoe hares in
   the southwestern Yukon, Canada. We monitored survival of squirrels on
   three control grids and a predator exclosure from March 1991 through
   August 1993. On controls, adult survival during the breeding season
   decreased from 1991, when snowshoe hare populations were high, to 1992,
   when hare populations declined rapidly. Survival increased slightly in
   1993, when hare and predator populations were very low. Similarly, adult
   survival during winter was lower in 1992-1993 than in 1991-1992. Adult
   survival on the exclosure remained similar in each breeding season but
   declined during winter 1992-1993. Adult survival was similar on the
   controls and the exclosure in each year except during winter 1991-1992
   and the 1992 breeding season, when it was lower on the controls. There
   was no difference in juvenile survival between the controls and the
   exclosure. Despite the decrease in adult survival due to predation,
   there was no population decline on any of the control grids. We conclude
   that predation did not have a measurable impact on red squirrel
   densities at Kluane and that it is unlikely red squirrels show 10-year
   population cycles in conjunction with snowshoe hares.}},

Abstract = {{I examined the home-range relationships and spatial organization of an
   untrapped lynx (Lynx canadensis) population in the southern Northwest
   Territories, Canada. I determined annual home ranges and static and
   dynamic interactions among 30 radio-collared adult lynx from April 1989
   to April 1993. Densities of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), the main
   prey, declined during winter 1990-1991. There was extensive range
   overlap between sexes, and between certain pairs of female lynx. Ranges
   among most males and among other individual or pairs of females were
   more exclusive. Most intrasexual dynamic interactions indicated neither
   attraction nor avoidance, suggesting that home-range boundaries were
   maintained by passive means. Two male-female pairs showed some positive
   attraction during the early part of the first winter of low hare
   density. Home ranges of three male and three female lynx monitored for 3
   consecutive years were stable. Spatial organization broke down during
   winter 1991-1992, when all resident lynx died or dispersed; this was
   concomitant with the first full winter of low hare density. Spatial
   organization observed prior to low hare densities may be described as a
   land-tenure system, based on prior residency, and may have served to
   regulate the density of this untrapped population during peak prey
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of long term data concerning a period of six years has
   allowed for the first time a detailed study of the trend and evolution
   of atmospheric depositions, and the evaluation of their interaction with

   deposition over critical loads will be examine;l. The data concerning
   Bosco Fontana (province of Mantua - Lombardy) are referred. They are
   representative of the Po Valley reality, where different anthropic
   activities, mainly agriculture and zootechnics live together. Average
   contents of sulphur and nitrogen of wet and dry depositions are 12.6 and
   16.1 kg ha(-1); average exceedances of atmospheric depositions over
   critical loads for sulphur, nitrogen and acidity are in the classes 3, 3
   and 5 respectively. Parameters of wet and dry depositions have a
   lognormal and exponential distribution respectively, while pH has two
   superimposed normal populations.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 15 years the endangered eastern timber wolf (Canis lupus
   lycaon) has been slowly recolonizing northern Wisconsin and, more
   recently, upper Michigan, largely by dispersing from Minnesota (where it
   is listed as threatened).  We have used geographic information systems
   (GISs) and spatial radiocollar data on recolonizing wolves in northern
   Wisconsin to assess the importance of landscape-scale factors in
   defining favorable wolf habitat.  We built a multiple logistic
   regression model applied to the northern Great Lakes states to estimate
   the amount and spatial distribution of favorable wolf habitat at the
   regional landscape scale.  Our results suggest that areas with high
   probability of favorable habitat are more extensive than previously
   estimated in the northern Great Lake States.  Several variables were
   significant in comparing new pack areas in Wisconsin to nonpack areas,
   including land ownership class, land cover type, road density, human
   population, and spatial landscape indices such as fractal dimension
   (land cover patch boundary complexity), land cover type contagion,
   landscape diversity, and landscape dominance.  Road density and fractal
   dimension were the most important predictor variables in the logistic
   regression models.  The results indicate that public forest land and
   private industrial forest land are both important in managing for a
   broad-ranging animal such as the wolf.  Our data portray favorable
   habitat that is highly fragmented along development corridors in
   northern Wisconsin, which may be responsible for the slow growth of the
   wolf population.  Upper Michigan, which is just beginning to be
   colonized by wolves, has very large, contiguous areas of likely habitat
   approaching the importance of those in northeastern Minnesota.  If
   continuing development or wolf control restrict dispersing wolves from
   moving from Minnesota to Wisconsin, and Wisconsin habitat becomes more
   marginal through further fragmentation, Michigan has the potential to
   maintain a significant wolf population independent of Minnesota and
   serve as a source population for Wisconsin.  However, a simple
   island/corridor model of wolf habitat in Wisconsin does not seem to
   apply.  Wolves apparently move throughout the landscape, across many
   unfavorable areas, but establishment success is restricted to higher
   quality habitat.  Source-sink dynamics may be operating here, and they
   suggest that reduction of the Minnesota population in the near term may
   affect recovery in Wisconsin and Michigan.  Our analysis is an example
   of use of long-term monitoring data and large-scale cross-boundary
   regional analysis that must be done to solve complex spatial questions
   in resource management and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{We compared evidence for successful reproduction of tuatara (Sphenodon
   punctatus punctatus) in the presence or absence of introduced Pacific
   rats (kiore, Rattus exulans) for islands in the Mercury Group and Hen
   and Chickens Group, New Zealand.  Tuatara were captured more frequently
   on the two kiore-free islands than on the six kiore-inhabited islands,
   suggesting reduced density in the presence of kiore.  On the two
   kiore-free islands, 22.2-30.8\% of all tuatara captured were juveniles
   or small adults (< 200 mm snout-vent length).  In contrast, juvenile
   tuatara were not seen on five of the six kiore-inhabited islands and
   small adults were absent from three.  These data support an earlier
   study suggesting that kiore inhibit recruitment of tuatara.  Both sexes
   of adult tuatara were present on kiore-inhabited islands, and plasma
   concentrations of sex hormones suggest that at least some adults remain
   reproductively active on most islands.  Throughout their range, tuatara
   have become extinct this century on four islands inhabited by kiore,
   they are on the verge of extinction on two kiore-inhabited islands
   sampled in this study and two kiore-inhabited islands not sampled, and
   they are absent from at least six other kiore-inhabited islands on which
   on biogeographic grounds they would be expected to be present.  Although
   the data remain circumstantial, the most plausible explanation of these
   observations is that kiore can cause extinction of tuatara through
   competition for food and/or predation on eggs and juveniles.  In the
   absence of kiore eradication the four worst-case populations of tuatara
   would probably be extinct within 10-20 years and populations on three
   other islands would probably be relictual or extinct within 30-50 years.
   Kiore eradiction is being carried out on most of these islands, in part
   to help ensure tuatara survival.  Well-monitored eradication programs
   will enable an experimental test of the hypothesis that tuatara
   densities and recruitment rates are enhanced in the absence of kiore.}},

Abstract = {{Three hundred and thirty-eight plants of Acer rufinerve Sieb. et Zucc.
   were monitored in a secondary deciduous forest for 5 years in terms of
   their sex expression and fruiting habit.  Two types of flowers,
   functionally male and female, were recognized.  The adult population
   consisted of constant males, inconstants and constant females.  Constant
   males, plants that bore exclusively male flowers throughout the study
   period, accounted for 87\% of the adult population.  Thirty-four
   inconstant plants (11\%) changed their sex in various ways.  Constant
   females which accounted for only 2\% of the population, were
   significantly smaller plants than the other two morphs, and suffered
   greater mortality.  Fruit set was consistent and generally high for
   plants bearing female flowers.  Thirteen juvenile plants out of 17 began
   reproduction during the 5 years, and all became male.  For inconstant
   plants, fluctuation in sex expression tended to be more frequent and/or
   greater in magnitude for smaller plants.  However, there was no evidence
   of the directional sex transition predicted by the size advantage
   hypothesis.  Plant health and the successional stage of the stand should
   be taken into account as well as resource allocation problems to explain
   the proximate mechanisms of sex expression.}},

Abstract = {{Six monitoring plots were established in the northern part of West Java,
   Indonesia, to clarify the factors that influence population fluctuations
   of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci.  Yellow sticky traps were used to
   monitor adult populations.  To examine the relationship between the
   population fluctuations and the quantity of food resources, the quantity
   of food resources of B. tabaci (i.e.  soybean and mung bean) was also
   investigated routinely in each subdistrict where the experimental plot
   was located.  The maximum number of adults per trap in each sowing
   season showed a similar noticeable seasonal trend in all experimental
   plots.  Climatic factors did not have a major role to play in population
   fluctuations.  The number of adults per trap in each experimental plot
   tended to increase when the quantity of food resources in each
   subdistrict increased.  The changes of the quantity of food resources
   seemed to influence the population fluctuations.  It is suggested that
   the operation of regulatory processes in population density is
   influenced largely by both the distance between habitat patches and the
   amplitude of temporal fluctuations of the quantity of food resources. 
   An explanation for why the time lag between fluctuations of the quantity
   of food resources and the number of individuals of B. tabaci occurred is
   discussed.  Based on their flight ability and intrinsic rate of natural
   increase, B. tabaci is considered not to be a serious pest in the
   environment where the host plants are grown discontinuously in time and
   space.}},

Abstract = {{I combined long-term (10 yr) descriptive and short-term experimental
   studies in a headwater stream in northern Minnesota to assess: (1) the
   effect of annual variation in stream discharge and spatial proximity of
   beaver (Castor canadensis) ponds on lotic fish abundance and (2) the
   subsequent influence of discharge and fish predation on lotic
   invertebrate colonization. Considerable annual variation in fish density
   occurred in the stream over the 10-yr period, particularly in pool
   habitats. Increased fish density was associated with increased stream
   discharge and creation of beaver ponds downstream from the study site.
   Weir traps used to monitor directional (upstream vs. downstream) fish
   movement during the last 4 yr of the study indicated annual changes in
   fish density were associated with the amount of fish dispersal occurring
   along the stream segment. Downstream fish movement, out of an upstream
   beaver pond occurred primarily during periods of elevated stream
   discharge. Upstream movement, out of a downstream beaver pond, occurred
   over a broader range of discharge conditions. A controlled,
   `'split-stream,'' experiment examining the effect of very low vs.
   elevated discharge on upstream fish movement indicated, however, that
   upstream movement of fish out of beaver ponds was also reduced by very
   low discharge conditions. Movement data for individual fish species
   revealed considerable variation among the taxa in the tendency for
   downstream vs. upstream movement, due to variation in the morphology of
   upstream vs. downstream beaver ponds and its subsequent effect on the
   composition of fish dispersing from these source areas. Most fish
   movement occurred over relatively brief time periods, suggesting life
   history and developmental processes were critical in influencing the
   timing of dispersal. Size structure of fishes captured in the stream
   indicated predominantly older age classes (>age I) of fish were
   dispersing along the stream. However, based on the occurrence of age 0
   individuals only 1 of 12 species, the creek chub (Semotilus
   atromaculatus), routinely reproduced in the stream.
   Experiments conducted in an artificial stream located below one of the
   beaver ponds indicated discharge and fish predation have potentially
   strong and interactive effects on invertebrate colonization in stream
   ecosystems. Differences in colonization of riffles and pools under low
   vs. elevated discharge and fish vs. no-fish treatments suggested,
   however, that the interactive effect of these factors on invertebrate
   colonization was variable over even small spatial scales. Elevated
   discharge increased invertebrate colonization in riffles but decreased
   invertebrate colonization in pools. Contrary to intuitive expectations,
   fish predation reduced invertebrate colonization more under elevated
   than low discharge conditions, particularly in pool habitats.
   Taken together, these results suggest: (1) beaver ponds act as
   reproductive `'sources'' for fish on the landscape, while adjacent
   stream environments act as potential reproductive `'sinks,'' (2)
   large-scale spatial relationships between beaver ponds and streams,
   along with the influence of discharge on the permeability of the
   boundaries between these habitats, are critical in controlling fish
   dispersal between ponds and streams and the subsequent abundance and
   composition of fish in lotic ecosystems, and (3) fish predation and
   discharge have potentially cascading effects on invertebrate
   colonization in lotic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{This field study used a precise method of assessing effects of
   insecticides on bird populations by establishing a marked population
   before application and determining survival rates of known individuals
   after application of the insecticides. We investigated the effects of
   two organophosphate granular insecticides applied to cornfields in
   southwestern Ontario to combat the corn rootworm (Diabrotica spp.). Nine
   control fields and 11 treated fields, six of which were treated with
   Fonofos (Dyfonate 20G) and five treated with Terbufos (Counter 15G),
   were chosen. A colour-banded population of 228 Song Sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia) was established and numbers monitored before and after
   application of the insecticides. Activity watches showed that
   territorial individuals spent at least some of their time foraging on
   the cornfields. There was no evidence that the insecticides affected the
   survivorship of either male or female Song Sparrows in the test
   population. Results from analyses of counts suggest no dramatic impact
   in three other species of passerines (Horned Lark Eremophila alpestris,
   Savannah Sparrow Passerculus sandwichensis and Vesper Sparrow Pooecetes
   gramineus). Sublethal effects of the insecticides on reproductive
   success of the Song Sparrow population were investigated. Ninety-one
   nests were found and their outcome (successful or failed) determined.
   Nest watches showed that parents collected some food for their young
   from cornfields in at least half of the nests. None of the reproductive
   parameters measured - reproductive success, clutch size, number of
   unhatched eggs, number of young fledged per nest - differed among the
   two types of treated fields and the control fields. In conclusion, the
   Song Sparrows studied were not ingesting the insecticide granules in
   lethal doses or in amounts sufficient to affect reproductive success
   and, hence, no differences in survivorship of adults nor in those
   reproductive parameters measured among the three field types were
   detected.}},

Abstract = {{The pharmacokinetics of thiocyanate (SCN-) in the blood plasma of 35-g
   rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were followed during a 20-day
   exposure to 39.8 mg SCN- liter(-1) and the subsequent 16-day depuration
   period. SCN- concentrations were determined by reverse-phase HPLC.
   Kinetic constants were estimated using a one-compartment first-order
   kinetic model fitted to the data by the computer programs BIOFAC and
   SYSTAT. The respective BIOFAC and SYSTAT estimates for the uptake rate
   constant (k(1), 0.55 and 0.49 day(-1)), the depuration rate constant
   (k(2), 0.34 and 0.29 day(-1)), and the bioconcentration factor (BCF,
   1.61 and 1.66) were similar for both methods of calculation. Field
   studies were conducted to determine the impact of SCN- on white sucker
   (Catostomus commersoni) populations in waters receiving SCN--bearing
   effluents. The assessment was based on SCN- concentrations in water and
   fish plasma, and the thyroid histology of the fish. Although SCN- was
   detected in the water at one site, no SCN- was detected in fish plasma
   and none of the thyroid pathology characteristic of chronic SCN-
   exposure was present. The results suggest that SCN- was not a hazard to
   the white sucker populations studied. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A two-year sampling study (1992-93) in a flat storage of shelled corn
   showed that the larger pirate bug, Lyctocoris campestris (F.)
   (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae), can be detected by relative sampling
   techniques as early as the second week of May. The perceived seasonal
   pattern of L. campestris varied with trapping method. Of the three
   relative sampling methods used, probe traps consistently captured more
   bugs of both sexes than cardboard traps in the grain and sticky flight
   traps. Probe traps showed a third degree polynomial trend through the
   season. On the other hand, flight traps were effective for monitoring L.
   campestris population during early and mid-summer when temperatures were
   high, but the effectiveness declined during late summer and early fall.
   Cardboard traps showed the opposite trend to those of flight traps, with
   increasing L. campestris abundance during the fall when bugs sought
   refuge as temperature decreased. Sampling date and environmental
   factors, including grain moisture content, air and grain temperatures
   were correlated with trap capture. Earlier work reported that L.
   campestris showed a highly female biased sex ratio in the field as
   opposed to a 1:1 sex ratio in laboratory colonies. The present study
   found that the estimate of sex ratios in the field can differ with
   trapping methods. Of the three relative sampling methods used, flight
   and cardboard traps, in most cases, showed no deviation from a 1:1 sex
   ratio. Probe traps, however, indicated a highly female biased sex ratio
   in field populations. Absolute sampling using a 1140 mi cup sampler also
   showed no deviation from a 1:1 sex ratio in the field population. The
   data suggested that relative sampling methods may be inappropriate for
   sex ratio estimation in the field. Thus, an absolute sampling method is
   required for determination of the true field sex ratio of L. campestris.
   Analyses of dispersion patterns showed that both males and females of L.
   campestris exhibit an aggregated spatial distribution in the grain.}},

   colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta Buren. Thirty laboratory
   colonies were fed 1, 2, or 4 crickets per day. Half were given access to
   unlimited sugar water. Colony biomass, cricket collection, and sugar
   collection were monitored weekly until each colony stopped growing
   Caloric intake was strongly correlated with and directly proportional to
   colony biomass (live weight) over an 8-fold range (2-16 g). Colonies
   needed approximate to 1.14 +/- 0.29 (Standard deviation) Kcal of food
   per gram of colony per week to sustain themselves. The presence of sugar
   decreased the amount of cricket biomass collected (dry weight) from
   0.186 g/g of colony per week for colonies receiving crickets to 0.196
   g/g of colony per week for colonies receiving both sugar water and
   crickets. Colonies fed only crickets approximately doubled their final
   size with the doubling of cricket availability; whereas, colonies
   receiving both crickets and sugar increased to a lesser extent. The
   laboratory food collection rates in this study suggest that a field

Abstract = {{Data obtained from national probability sample surveys provide important
   information on the prevalence of various health conditions and
   distributions of physical and biochemical characteristics of the U.S.
   population. The sample design of a survey specifies how sampling from a
   designated population over a stated period is to be accomplished. A
   survey's analytical objectives and interests-in particular
   subpopulations-affect the sample design strategy. Selected subdomains of
   ?he population often must be oversampled so ?hat estimates can be made
   with acceptable precision. This article addresses sample design
   considerations for a national probability sample for human tissue
   monitoring and specimen banking. Among the sampling issues addressed are
   the oversampling of special populations e.g., minority groups and
   at-risk groups such as low income or elderly persons; geographic
   coverage; and sample size considerations. The sample design for a major
   health survey, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (NHANES III), is used to illustrate a complex, multistage
   probability sample design and to highlight some of the sampling issues
   discussed in this article.}},

Abstract = {{The short-term effects of air pollution on morbidity in the Athens
   population were studied. Data were collected on the daily number of
   emergency outpatient visits and admissions for cardiac and respiratory
   causes (diagnoses at time of admission) to all major hospitals in the
   greater Athens area during 1988. Measurements of air pollution made by
   the Ministry of the Environment monitoring network included values for
   smoke, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Statistical analysis was
   done using multiple linear regression models controlling for potential
   confounding effects of meteorological and chronological variables,
   separately for winter (1/1-3/21 and 9/22-12/31) and summer (3/22-9/21).
   It was found that the daily number of emergency visits was related
   positively with the levels of air pollution, but this association did
   not reach the nominal level of statisical significance for most
   pollutants. The number of emergency admissions for cardiac and
   respiratory causes was related to a statistically significant degree
   with all indices of air pollution during the winter. Thus, the average
   adjusted increase in the daily number of cardiac admissions
   corresponding to an increase from the 5th to the 95th percentile of the
   season-specific distribution of each pollutant ranges from 15 to 17\% or
   from 11 to 12.5 admissions per day, and for the daily number of
   respiratory admissions from 20 to 29\% or from 8.3 to 12.1 admissions.
   The results of the present study indicate that air pollution in the
   Athens area has short-term effects on morbidity in the population. (C)

Abstract = {{Breeding crested newts (Triturus cristatus) were studied in two ponds at
   a privately-owned secure site. Numbers counted at night were found to be
   positively related to numbers trapped or netted using standardized
   techniques. Night counting was used to monitor changes in breeding
   numbers from 1983 to 1993. In one pond, counts declined to zero by 1990
   as a result of siltation and drought conditions. In the main breeding
   pond, considerable year-to-year fluctuations occurred, with annual mean
   counts ranging from 3 to 183. A significant rise was recorded in 1985,
   that was attributed to exceptional recruitment to the adult population.
   Counts remained high until 1988, but then declined. Numbers decreased
   even further during the drought years of 1991 and 1992, despite small
   pools being dug. These small pools were evidently unattractive and were
   mainly ignored. After heavy rain recharged the pond in autumn 1992,
   counts returned to a similar level in 1993 to that recorded at the start
   of the study, 9-10 years before. Catches of larvae varied considerably
   from year to year. Larval numbers were not related to counts of adults,
   but were positively correlated with catches of larvae of smooth newts T.
   vulgaris, which also breed at the site. Implications for the
   conservation of crested newts are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies were undertaken to document pod infestation by European
   corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) during the harvest season, to evaluate
   timings of insecticide applications, and to evaluate whether monitoring
   populations in traps is an appropriate basis for timing insecticide
   applications. Over a three year period at several locations, acephate
   was sprayed on 5-d to 14-d schedules, and pepper pods were evaluated
   during periodic harvests. Damage by O. nubilalis was usually highest in
   the first two harvests, when as few as 36\% of the pods were undamaged
   in untreated plots. Later harvests were less affected by O. nubilalis
   but were sometimes infested by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) or
   corn earworm (Helicouerpa zea). In 1990, when O. nubilalis populations
   were moderate in size, fewer infested pods and higher yields were found
   in plots treated on a 7-d schedule than on a 14-d schedule. In 1991,
   when populations were exceptionally high, damage was high even in plots
   sprayed every 7 d. In 1992, when populations were low to moderate,
   damage was light and no yield advantage resulted from a variable 5- to
   10-d schedule versus a 7-d schedule. A 7-d schedule was suitable in
   years with average O. nubilalis activity, starting when blacklight traps
   consistently caught one or more moths per night. Pheromone traps appear
   to be an acceptable alternative to blacklight traps, but a
   pheromone-based threshold has not yet been tested. Management of
   European corn borer on peppers in Ohio must be supplemented in the later
   part of the season by management of fall armyworm and corn earworm.}},

Abstract = {{A seven-year study has been carried out in Lleida (NE Spain) to evaluate
   the relative occurrence of holocyclic and anholocyclic populations of
   Rhopalosiphum padi and Sitobion avenae and how this may determine their
   population dynamics and the BYDV epidemiology. Winter cereal, forage
   cereals and cereal volunteers were sampled in autumn, winter and the
   beginning of spring using a D-Vac. Alates were also monitored with a
   suction trap. A number of twigs of several species of Prunus sp. other
   than Prunus padus, which is absent from the region, were monitored for
   R. padi eggs and fundatrices. The following features were found: (1) low
   percentage of males caught in suction traps and D-Vac samplings; (2) no
   sexual morphs or eggs of S. avenae were found on winter and forage
   cereals and volunteers; (3) no eggs and fundatrices of R. padi could be
   detected on possible alternative primary hosts; and (4) a wide presence
   and development of populations of both aphid species on cereals over the
   autumn and winter. These findings support the hypothesis that the
   anholocycle is the main overwintering strategy for R. padi and S.
   avenae. This would enhance the influence of winter conditions-mainly
   temperature and rainfall-on the yearly population dynamics of cereal
   aphids and on BYDV epidemiology.}},

Abstract = {{1 Various resistance phenotypes of L. marginale can be identified
   according to their responses to nine distinct pathotypes of the rust
   fungus M. lini. The relative frequency of these phenotypes was monitored
   on an 8-m x 8-m permanent plot established at Kiandra in southern New
   South Wales, Australia.
   2 Over the period 1986-92 there was a marked change in the resistance
   structure of this population. This change was particularly associated
   with a major epidemic of rust occurring in the summer of 1989. The
   dominance of the host population by three resistance phenotypes prior to
   the epidemic was subsequently lost.
   3 A similar change in resistance structure was detected in random
   samples taken in 1981 and 1991 from a different part of the same
   population. The changes in resistance in both the random-sample and the
   permanent plots were of no obvious adaptive value.
   4 The distribution of the commonest resistance phenotypes on the
   permanent plot originally showed distinct patterns of aggregation which
   disappeared after the 1989 epidemic.
   5 It is possible that the changing frequencies of particular resistance
   phenotypes could be explained by linkage between resistance genes and
   other traits that are under more intense selection, Alternatively, the
   changing frequencies could result from the combined effects of the
   presence of a pathogen pathotype which is, at least at certain
   locations, virulent on all host phenotypes, recruitment patterns in the
   host population and low pathogen transmission efficiencies.}},

   organophosphorus, carbamate, cyclodiene, and pyrethroid insecticides to
   the boil weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, and to monitor
   field populations for tolerance to such insecticides. In tests in which
   responses of the USDA Ebony strain boil weevils were compared with those
   collected in the field in the Brazos Valley, TX, in 1988, tolerance to
   organophosphorus, pyrethroid, and carbamate insecticides was
   demonstrated. The usefulness of the glass vial technique for monitoring
   tolerance was confirmed in 1991 and 1992 by field data from Texas,
   Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Sonora, Mexico. These tests
   indicated tolerance to organophosphorus and pyrethroid insecticides in
   several boil weevil populations. Tolerance monitoring may be a useful
   technique in the implementation of boil weevil eradication programs.}},

   ornamentals nurseries in California in which abamectin has been used for
   the control of Liriomyza sp. leafminers and twospotted spider mites were
   evaluated for their susceptibility to abamectin with a leaf residual
   assay. Mite populations sampled during 1991 varied greatly in their
   susceptibility, with ratios at the LC(95) ranging from 1 to 658 in a 1-d
   leaf residual assay. Resistance was correlated with the number of
   applications and the total time of abamectin use. Resistance was not
   detected in nurseries that had used the product <6 times per year and
   for a total of <30 applications over a 6-yr period. In these nurseries,
   spider mite populations had up to 77\% survivorship at a discriminating
   concentration of 3 ppm of abamectin. Twospotted spider mites collected
   from a rose nursery not included in this analysis were subjected to
   further selection with abamectin in the laboratory. After 38 cycles of
   selection over 9 mo, resistance in the selected population (relative to
   a susceptible standard population) increased from 13- to 1,597-fold at
   LC(95) in a 1-d leaf residual assay The resistance ratio of the selected

Abstract = {{Five applications of abamectin applied at a concentration of 12 ppm and
   at 3- to 5-d intervals as full canopy sprays provided effective control
   of Tetranychus urticae Koch on greenhouse roses, but also eliminated a
   biological control agent, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot.
   However, abamectin applications confined to the upper portion of the
   canopy (from where the marketed portion of the crop is taken) provided
   chemical control of spider mites in the upper canopy. The lower canopy
   supported a rapidly decreasing spider mite population and a slightly
   increasing population of P. persimilis. These results show the potential
   for integration of biological control of T. urticae with chemical
   control of T. urticae and other pests of greenhouse roses. Dispersion of
   T. urticae was determined using Taylor's power law, and
   fixed-precision-level sampling plans were developed for estimating
   population densities. Use of binomial sequential sampling plans, using
   differential action thresholds for upper and lower canopies, are
   proposed for monitoring T. urticae in commercial rose production. The
   potential for control of T. urticae through pest population monitoring
   and integration of chemical and biological control is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction between twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch,
   and the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot, on roses
   was studied in a greenhouse at Cornell University. In the absence of
   predators, the spider mite population showed typical S-shaped growth and
   averaged approximate to 4-fold increases in density in 3 wk. In the
   presence of predators, spider mites showed an initially slow (<50\%)
   increase followed by a decline concurrent with a rapid increase of
   predators. Spider mites were nearly eliminated within 5 nk of the
   introduction of the predators. Most spider mites were found on the lower
   canopy when their overall density was low but more mites were found on
   the upper canopy when their density increased, especially in the absence
   of predators. Both spider mites and predators were strongly aggregated.
   The dispersion of spider mites was similar in the upper and lower canopy
   and was not affected by the presence of predators. Regressions of
   predator density on prey density revealed 44\% positive
   density-dependent aggregation. The strength of aggregation increased
   with predator density and was positively associated with the suppression
   of prey population. The spider mite population growth rate was
   negatively related to both predator and spider mite density; the effect
   of predator density on the growth rate was 35 times greater than that of
   spider mite density. Potential for control of T. urticae on roses
   through pest population monitoring and the integration of chemical and
   biological control is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The response of newer thrips, Frankliniella spp., to various colors and
   sticky trap designs was evaluated in staked tomato fields in western
   North Carolina. Yellow sticky traps caught significantly more thrips
   compared with blue or white traps. There were no differences in the
   relative proportion of thrips species caught on different colored traps.
   The size of the flower sampling unit (i.e., 10-flowers versus all
   flowers per plant) did not influence the correlation between sticky trap
   catches and thrips abundance in flowers. Only F. occidentalis (Pergande)
   exhibited a significant correlation between percent abundance on all
   colors of sticky traps and percent abundance in flowers. Colored sticky
   traps caught high numbers off. tritici (Fitch), despite the fact that
   few F. tritici were collected from flowers. In tests to evaluate
   different trap designs, cylindrical and cup traps caught more F. tritici
   than glass slide traps. Cylindrical sticky traps were more economical
   and enabled easier identification of thrips than glass slide or cup
   traps.}},

Abstract = {{An ozone (O-3) exposure assessment study was conducted in Toronto,
   Ontario, Canada during the winter and summer of 1992. A new passive O-3
   sampler developed by Harvard was used to measure indoor, outdoor, and
   personal O-3 concentrations. Measurements were taken weekly and daily
   during the winter and summer, respectively. Indoor samples were
   collected at a total of 50 homes and workplaces of study participants.
   Outdoor O-3 concentrations were measured both at home sites using the
   passive sampler and at 20 ambient monitoring sites with continuous
   monitors. Personal O-3 measurements were collected from 123
   participants, who also completed detailed time-activity diaries. A total
   of 2,274 O-3 samples were collected. In addition, weekly air exchange
   rates of homes were measured.
   This study demonstrates the performance of our O-3 sampler for exposure
   assessment. The data obtained are further used to examine the
   relationships between personal, indoor (home and workplace), and outdoor
   O-3 concentrations, and to investigate outdoor and indoor spatial
   variations in O-3 concentrations. Based on home outdoor and indoor,
   workplace, and ambient O-3 concentrations measured at the Ontario
   Ministry of the Environment (MOE) sites, the traditional
   microenvironmental model predicts 72\% of the variability in measured
   personal exposures. An alternative personal O-3 exposure model based on
   outdoor measurements and time-activity information is able to predict
   the mean personal exposures in a large population, with the highest R(2)
   value of 0.41.}},

Abstract = {{Within the past decade, populations of the poplar twiggall fly, Hexomyza
   Schineri (Giraud) (Diptera: Agromyzidae), have greatly increased along
   the Front Range of Colorado. The insect produces smooth, knot-like galls
   on the current year twigs of Populus spp., particularly aspen. These
   swellings continue to expand even after the insect emerges from the gall
   the following spring. The average length of galls produced in aspen was
   12.91 mm with an average diameter of 8.48 mm. The average number of live
   H. schineri larvae and pupae was 1.4/gall. However, number of insects
   per gall was not correlated to gall size. Only one species of parasitoid
   wasp, Eurytoma contractura (Bugbee) (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae), was
   reared from the galls and percent parasitism averaged 21.5 percent.
   Additionally, predation by chickadees, particularly of the pupal stage,
   was observed. A wide range of galling was observed in an established
   planting of nine aspen clones, suggesting that development of resistant
   cultivars may be a useful control approach. The color fluorescent green
   was most attractive to adult flies and could be used to monitor adult
   insects but was not sufficiently attractive to be used in trap out
   strategies.}},

   harvested bears.  I investigated characteristics of an indiscriminate
   brown bear harvest in the Oshima Peninsula, Hokkaido, Japan, by
   interviewing hunters and determining the sex and age of bears killed
   from 1983 through 1987.  Harvest structure differed by seasons and
   methods.  Females with cubs were killed during den hunts 10 times more
   often (P < 0.001) than during postemergence hunts in spring (Jan-May). 
   A higher (P = 0.028) ratio of males (excluding young bears) was taken in
   traps when compared with those pursued and shot in summer and autumn
   (Jun-Dec).  There were reproductive, status-related differences in the
   proportions of adult females taken in spring harvest and those taken in
   summer and autumn harvests.  During spring, the proportion of females
   with cubs was lower (P = 0.043), whereas the proportion of females with
   yearlings was higher (P < 0.001) than during summer and autumn.  Den
   hunting should be prohibited to protect females with cubs.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring body mass and composition is important for detecting
   declining vigor in caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) populations.  We
   developed regression models to predict body mass and composition of
   female barren-ground caribou, using easily measured variables, including
   those available under 4 constraints faced by managers:  access to
   harvested carcasses but not to measurements that would destroy meat, no
   access to pre-dressing measurements of harvested carcasses, no access to
   specialized laboratory techniques, and access only to external
   measurements of live animals.  We evaluated 38 continuous variables for
   predictability of body mass and composition.  Heart, gastrocnemius, and
   liver masses were best (P = 0.001) all-seasons indices of body mass. 
   Peroneus tertius mass correlated (P < 0.001) with body mass in June,
   September, and November.  Predicted body mass generally did not differ
   (P > 0.01) from observed body mass for simple and multiple regression
   models.  Gastrocnemius and kidney fat masses were best (P < 0.001)
   all-seasons indices of carcass plus viscera mass.  Best (P < 0.001)
   monthly indices of carcass plus viscera mass were femur and peroneus
   tertius masses in March-April, peroneus tertius mass in June, kidney fat
   mass or kidney fat index in September, and heart and peroneus tertius
   masses in November.  Water content in indicator muscles and left kidney
   fat index were the only all-seasons indices of percent body fat.  Best
   (P < 0.001) monthly indices of percent body fat were femur marrow water
   and kidney fat mass in March-April, tibia marrow fat mass in June,
   gastrocnemius fat content and chest girth in September, and metatarsus
   marrow water in November.  Marrow fat mass correlated (P < 0.001)
   linearly with percent body fat over all observed body fat values and was
   an alternative to percent marrow fat, which provided estimates of body
   fat in lean animals only.  Single indices of percent body protein were
   found only in March-April.  There were more indices of carcass plus
   viscera mass and percent body fat in September than in any other
   sampling month, and fewest in June.  Superior (P < 0.001) correlations
   in multiple regression models of all body components justified use of
   combined indices, but use of meat-destroying pre-dressing, or
   complicated measurements were not always warranted.  Exclusion of
   meat-destroying measurements from multiple regression models did not
   reduce (P < 0.001) correlations with body or carcass plus viscera masses
   appreciably, but reduced (P < 0.001) correlations with body fat in all
   seasons and with body protein in September and November.  Further
   exclusion of pre-dressing measurements and those requiring sophisticated
   laboratory techniques reduced (P < 0.001) correlations with body mass
   and precluded use of multiple regression models in predicting body
   protein.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated age-specific annual survival rates for 159 bald eagles
   (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) radiotagged from 1989 to 1992 in Prince
   William Sound (PWS), Alaska.  We monitored radio-tagged eagles for
   less-than-or-equal-to 3 years beginning 4 months after the Exxon Valdez
   oil spill.  There was no difference (P > 0.10) in survival rates between
   eagles radiotagged in oiled areas and eagles radiotagged in unoiled
   areas of PWS.  Pooled annual survival rates were 71\% for first-year
   eagles, 95\% for subadults, and 88\% for adult bald eagles.  Most deaths
   occurred from March to May.  We found no indication that survival of
   bald eagles radiotagged > 4 months after the oil spill in PWS was
   directly influenced by the spill and concluded that any effect of the
   spill on survival occurred before eagles were radiotagged.  A
   deterministic life table model suggests that the PWS bald eagle
   population has an annual finite growth rate of 2\%.  Given the
   cumulative effects of direct mortality and reduced productivity caused
   by the oil spill, we predicted that the bald eagle population would
   return to its pre-spill size by 1992.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted annual aerial surveys of white-fronted (Anser albifrons
   frontalis) and Canada (Branta canadensis hutchinsii) geese during the
   first week of incubation over 8,000 ha near Walker Bay, Northwest
   Territories, from 1986 through 1992 to monitor population size and
   trend.  Unexpectedly, population estimates of each species fluctuated
   widely but similarly among years (r = 0.912, P = 0.003), causing us to
   examine relationships with ground studies.  Population estimates and
   nest success were negatively correlated for both species (r = -0.86, P =
   0.03 for white-fronted geese; r = -0.93, P = 0.01 for Canada geese). 
   Ground counts of nests on random 100-ha plots provided an unbiased
   estimate of nest density.  Visibility (the probability that an object
   within the field of search will be seen by the observer) of nesting
   geese was estimated from the ratio between nest densities estimated from
   the air and from the ground and was related to nest success for both
   species.  We concluded that the decrease in visibility of pairs with
   increasing nest success resulted from behavioral changes in birds that
   lost their nests.  Geese that lost their nests were more conspicuous
   because both members of the pair were together and flushed at greater
   distances, whereas 1 member of a successful pair was usually incubating.
   Because visibility of pairs can be low in years of high nest success,
   variation in visibility must be accounted for when estimating densities
   of nesting geese by aerial survey.  Failure to consider visibility could
   lead managers to erroneous conclusions about the status of arctic goose
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of management efforts, population indices for canvasbacks
   (Aythya valisineria) declined during 1955-93.  Since 1985, Catahoula
   Lake, located in central Louisiana, has attracted more wintering
   canvasbacks than any other site in North America.  Canvasbacks are
   attracted to Catahoula Lake because of its consistent flooding regime
   and abundant below-ground plant foods, but are at risk of lead (Pb)
   toxicosis because of the high density of spent Pb shot contained in
   sediments.  To estimate survival rates and determine sources and timing
   of mortality, we radiomarked 172 immature canvasbacks during winters
   1991-94.  Half of our sample had blood Pb concentrations
   greater-than-or-equal-to 0.2 parts per million (ppm) at time of capture
   and were considered Pb exposed.  Blood Pb concentrations of others
   (unexposed) were initially at background levels (i.e., Pb < 0.2 ppm). 
   Year had no effect on canvasback survival (P = 0.357), but survival was
   positively related to body mass (P = 0.014) and negatively related to
   the interaction of blood Pb concentration and body mass (P < 0.001). 
   Winter survival estimates for Pb-exposed immatures were lower (P
   less-than-or-equal-to 0.045) than those for unexposed immatures in
   1992-93 (0.569 vs. 0.815, respectively) and 1993-94 (0.578 vs. 0.923,
   respectively) but did not differ (P = 0.34) in 1991-92 (0.747 vs. 0.857,
   respectively) when Pb-exposed canvasbacks had greater body mass and
   lower blood Pb concentration.  Causes of mortality were gunshot (31\%),
   Pb toxicosis (16\%), drowning in commercial fishing nets (6\%), and
   unknown (47\%).  Survival estimates for Catahoula Lake canvasbacks,
   especially Pb-exposed individuals, were lower than those previously
   reported for immature females wintering in coastal Louisiana or
   Chesapeake Bay.  Most immatures that were initially exposed to Pb
   apparently survived the winter; however, subsequent survival and
   performance of annual cycle events may have been affected because
   exposed birds weighed less than unexposed birds.  We recommend that Pb
   exposure in waterfowl be periodically monitored and managers give
   priority to reducing Pb shot availability at concentration areas.}},

   length, and maximum distance reached from home were computed from 124
   complete foraging routes obtained from 18 higher-zoned and 18
   lower-zoned limpets. P. vulgata typically performed a single loop per
   night (average total length, ca. 70 cm), moving from the individual home
   scar to graze the surrounding algal grounds (average maximum distance,
   ca. 25 cm), then following its own trail back home. On the average,
   limpets moved from the home scar during three of four available
   nocturnal low tides and exploited about half the emersion time. Evidence
   for size-related variability in behaviour was found, as a positive
   correlation was assessed between both total duration and length of the
   excursions, and shell length. In addition, zonation was proved to affect
   the limpets' foraging behaviour, since low-shore limpets moved faster
   and covered greater distances than high-shore ones. Moreover, consistent
   seasonal variation in foraging behaviour emerged, since in April the
   excursions were longer and longer-lasting than in November, but limpets
   exploited a larger fraction of potential activity phases in November
   than in April. The within-population variability in the temporal and
   spatial characteristics of the foraging excursions is discussed in
   relation to the available data on zonal and seasonal variation of food
   resources and in relation to physiological changes due to reproductive
   cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The lipophilic pigment content and composition and in vivo optical
   density (OD) spectra for batch cultures of the Florida (USA) red-tide
   dinoflagellate Gymnodinium breve Davis were analyzed after exposure to
   irradiance treatments representative of an irradiance gradient that
   cells might experience in a coastal water column. Decreases in total
   chlorophyll (chl) content (attributable to decreases in chls a,
   c(1)/c(2) and c(3)) and total carotenoid content (attributable to
   decreases in total fucoxanthin and 19'-acylofucoxanthins, and
   gyroxanthin-diester) coincided with exposure to increased irradiance.
   The relative abundances of chi pigments remained constant whereas
   decreases in the relative abundances of total fucoxanthin and
   19'-acylofucoxanthins, and beta-psi-carotene and an increase in the
   relative abundance of diadinoxanthin coincided with exposure to
   increased irradiance. Because gyroxanthin-diester has been observed only
   in a limited number of toxic dinoflagellates (of which G. breve is the
   only warm-water taxon), was consistently quantifiable throughout various
   irradiance-induced physiological states, and had a distinctive elution
   position and absorption maxima in the chromatographic eluent, this
   carotenoid may serve as a `biomarker' for G. breve within Florida
   coastal waters. An analysis of variance, performed on fourth-derivative
   plots derived from normalized OD spectra, identified portions of the OD
   spectra which differed among irradiance treatments. Designated
   wavelengths coincided with wave crests in the fourth-derivative plots
   representative of absorption maxima for total chi c (460 to 468, 585 to
   590 nm) and total fucoxanthin and 19'-acylofucoxanthins, and
   diadinoxanthin (490 to 496 nm). Stepwise discriminant analysis
   identified a set of 6 wavelengths (403, 541, 546, 509, 673 and 663 nm)
   which optimally classified OD spectra for populations among irradiance
   treatments. This lack of correspondence between wavelengths identified
   by the 2 statistical techniques was not unexpected; fourth-derivative
   analysis identified portions of the OD spectra where differences in the
   sharpness of curvature (as produced by absorption maxima of component
   pigments) occurred among treatments whereas discriminant analysis
   identified portions of the spectra which could be used to classify
   populations among treatments and did not necessarily have to correspond
   to absorption maxima. Such detectable differences in the bio-optical
   `signatures' of G. breve indicate that previous light history, as
   manifested in the pigment component, could be incorporated into future
   pigment-based monitoring applications to allow for the detection and/or
   physiological characterization of problematic taxa prior to bloom
   status.}},

Abstract = {{Coal tar treated psoriasis patients were used as a model population to
   evaluate a panel of immunoassays for monitoring exposure to
   benzo{[}a]pyrene (BP) and related polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAH). The assays included measurement of PAH diol epoxide-DNA adducts
   in white blood cells by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) with fluorescence endpoint detection, PAH-albumin adducts by
   competitive ELISA with color endpoint detection and serum levels of
   antibodies recognizing BP diol epoxide-DNA adducts by noncompetitive
   color ELISA. PAH-DNA adducts by ELISA were elevated in patients (mean
   6.77 +/- 12.05/10(8)) compared to controls (4.90 +/- 8.81/10(8), p =
   0.12). There was no difference in PAH-albumin adducts between patients
   (mean 0.61 +/- 0.31 fmol/mu g) and controls (0.63 +/- 0.30 fmol/mu g).
   Glutathione S-transferase M1 genotype was also determined but no
   relationship was found between presence of the gene and either DNA or
   protein adduct levels. About 30\% of both patients and controls had
   measurable titer of antibodies recognizing BPDE-I-DNA adducts.
   Measurement of white blood cell DNA adducts by ELISA was the most
   sensitive method for detecting PAH exposure in coal tar-treated
   psoriasis patients.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated population monitoring study was initiated to investigate
   whether occupational exposure to current low levels of butadiene is
   mutagenic to workers. Ten exposed workers (mean production area
   concentration of 3.5 ppm) and 10 matched plant controls (mean exposure
   to 0.03 ppm) were selected and blood samples were collected for our
   study. The standard cytogenetic assay was used to determine chromosome
   aberration frequencies. In addition, a challenge assay was used to
   determine response to gamma-rays as an indication of DNA repair
   deficiencies. In the latter assay, cells were exposed to gamma-rays at
   the G1 phase of the cell cycle in vitro and the frequencies of
   chromosome aberrations in the first post-irradiation metaphase cells
   were quantitated. Based on results of the cytogenetic assay, the exposed
   group had a higher frequency of cells with chromosome aberrations and
   higher chromatid breaks per 100 cells compared with the control.
   However, the difference was not significant (p > 0.1). With the
   challenge assay, the exposed group had a higher frequency of aberrant
   cells (p < 0.04), chromatid breaks (p < 0.05), deletions (p < 0.07), and
   dicentrics (p < 0.02) than the controls. In addition, the dicentric
   frequencies from workers were significantly correlated with the presence
   of a butadiene metabolite
   {[}1,2-dihydroxy-4-(N-acetylcysteinyl-S)butane] in urine with a
   correlation of coefficient of 0.6 (p < 0.01). Two outliers were
   identified and our interpretation of their responses will be discussed.
   This study indicates that the workers had exposure-induced mutagenic
   effects. Together with the observation of gene mutation in a subset of
   the present population, this study indicates that the current
   occupational exposure to butadiene may not be safe to workers.}},

Abstract = {{The meristematic mitotic cells of plant roots are appropriate and
   efficient cytogenetic materials for the detection of clastogenicity of
   environmental pollutants, especially for in situ monitoring of water
   contaminants. Among several cytological endpoints in these fast dividing
   cells, such as chromosome/chromatid aberrations, sister-chromatid
   exchanges and micronuclei, the most effective and simplest indicator of
   cytological damage is micronucleus formation. Although the Allium cepa
   and Vicia faba root meristem micronucleus assays (Allium/Vicia root MCN)
   have been used in clastogenicity studies about 12 times by various
   authors in the last 25 years, there is no report on the comparison of
   the efficiency of these two plant systems and in different cell
   populations (meristem and F-1) of the root tip as well as under adequate
   recovery duration. In order to maximize the efficiency of these
   bioassays, the current study was designed to compare the Allium and the
   Vicia root MCN assays on the basis of chromosome length, peak
   sensitivity of the mitotic cells, and the regions of the root tip where
   the MCN are formed. The total length of the 2n complement of Allium
   chromosomes is 14.4 mu m and the total length of the 2n complement of
   Vicia is 9.32 mu m. The peak sensitivity determined by serial fixation
   at 12-h intervals after 100 R of X-irradiation is 44 h. The slope of the
   X-ray dose-response curve of Allium roots derived from the meristematic
   regions was lower than that derived from cells in the F-1 region. Higher
   efficiency was also demonstrated when the MCN frequencies were scored
   from the F-1 cells in both Allium and Vicia treated with formaldehyde
   (FA), mitomycin C (MMC), and maleic hydrazide (MH). The results
   indicated that scoring of MCN frequencies from the F-1 cell region of
   the root tip was more efficient than scoring from the meristematic
   region. The X-ray linear regression dose-response curves were
   established in both Allium and Vicia cell systems and the coefficients
   of correlations, slope values were used to verify the reliability and
   efficiency of these two plant cell systems. Based on the dose-response
   slope value of 0.894 for Allium and 0.643 for Vicia, the Allium root MCN
   was a more efficient test system. The greater sensitivity of the Allium
   roots is probably due to the greater total length of the diploid
   complement and the higher number of metacentric chromosomes. The
   Allium/Vicia root MCN test system was applied to determine the
   clastogenicity of saccharin (SC) and wastewater from Rio Queretaro and
   the Arena canal in the city of Queretaro, Mexico. The minimum effective
   dose (MED) is 10 R for X-rays, 50 mM for FA, 2.2 mM for MMC, 0.01 mM for
   MH, and 40 ppm for SC.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation aimed to assess the degree of dependence of young
   plants of Hyacinthoides non-scripta (L.) Chouard ex Rothm. on the
   formation of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) at different stages of its life
   cycle. H. nonscripta is a bulbous perennial with a restricted root
   system of coarse, unbranched elements which are plainly inadequate for
   the acquisition of phosphate (P) from soil. In a glasshouse experiment
   non-mycorrhizal H. nonscripta were unable to take up sufficient P to
   maintain a positive P budget, confirming that the species is obligately
   mycorrhizal when adult.
   We needed to be able to assess the ages of field-collected plants. The
   bulb of H. non-scripta, which is totally rebuilt annually, provides no
   indicator of age other than size. The development of individual bulbs
   was monitored in reconstructed soil profiles for several years and the
   relationship of size and age calculated in order to determine the age
   structure of a population in the field and to quantify the mycorrhizal
   colonization of their roots according to age and depth in the soil.
   Seedlings of H. non-scripta are supplied with a P-rich endosperm and
   initially inhabit upper soil horizons where P is plentiful. However,
   they are at risk from winter frosts, summer drought and, possibly,
   predators. During their first four to five seasons they descend in the
   soil to a depth of approximately 20 cm, down a gradient of decreasing
   soil phosphorus concentration; simultaneously, their roots become
   increasingly colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Because of the
   change in environment, they appear to become increasingly dependent on
   the symbiosis, suggesting that the association changes from facultative
   to obligate during the plant's life history.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that food resources regulate population size was tested
   in Columbian ground squirrels, Spermophilus columbianus, from 1981 to
   1986 in southwestern Alberta, Canada. Two replicate populations received
   supplemental food resources from 1981 to 1983, and were subsequently
   monitored until 1986. Two reference (unmanipulated) populations were
   monitored throughout the 6 years. During the experiment, dramatic
   increases in population size of about 500\% occurred. After
   supplementation, spring populations declined by about 20\% per year,
   under conditions that produced stressful shortages of food (as evidenced
   by significant decreases in body mass of ground squirrels). The
   demographic process that contributed most to increasing and decreasing
   experimental populations was production of yearlings, through changes in
   reproductive success and survival of young. Changes in migration
   contributed secondarily to changes in population size, and changes in
   adult survival were least important. While similarities of demographic
   processes were evident between replicates during population increases, a
   dramatic decrease in survival of young contributed to population decline
   at one replicate, and `'normal'' levels of reproduction and survival
   were sufficient to produce a decline in the other replicate. Demographic
   mechanisms may vary, but population regulation of mammalian populations
   appears strongly dependent on food resources.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of fishes on coral reefs are replenished by the settlement
   of pelagic larvae to demersal populations. Recruitment varies spatially
   and temporally and can exert strong effects on the dynamics of reef fish
   populations. This study examined the effect of microhabitat
   characteristics on small-scale and large-scale recruitment variation in
   the three-spot damselfish, Stegastes planifrons (Cuvier). Comparison of
   0.25-m(2) quadrats occupied by three-spots with randomly sampled null
   quadrats showed that three-spots quadrats contained a higher percent
   cover of the coral Montastrea annularis than would be expected at
   random. Manipulative experiments on three types of 1.0-m(2) patch reefs
   (living M. annularis, dead Porites Porites and dead Acropora palmata)
   patch reefs on showed that this non-random distribution was established
   by microhabitat choice during settlement and not by differential
   post-settlement survival. The presence of conspecific juveniles did not
   affect settlement. Recruitment was monitored at nine sites on three
   islands over 3 years. Recruitment showed no consistent pattern in the
   relative levels of recruitment among sites. Similarly, no consistent
   relationship emerged between recruitment levels and microhabitat
   characteristics at the nine sites. For example, at this large scale, the
   percent cover of M. annularis explained variation in recruitment in only
   1 out of 3 years. These results suggest that small-scale recruitment
   patterns are influenced by microhabitat choice during settlement, but
   that these habitat effects do not scale up to influence large-scale
   variation in recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{We intensively monitored space use and movement in Microtus californicus
   over a 2-year period that included 1 year of high density (maximum
   618/ha) and one of low (minimum 5/ha); historically this population has
   exhibited cycles of 2 or 4 years. Adults of both sexes dispersed at the
   start of the breeding season, culminating in the establishment of
   intrasexually exclusive territories. In females, these territories
   persisted throughout life, except that many young females recruiting
   during the breeding season established contiguous, overlapping, or
   adjacent home ranges with their mothers. This female philopatry explains
   the conclusion of previous workers that females of this species are
   non-territorial. In the dry (non-breeding) season, females had smaller
   ranges that often overlapped and were clustered. Adult males moved
   breeding territories at a modal interval of 6 weeks; this is consistent
   with their avoidance of inbreeding with philopatric daughters. Ranges
   overlapped 1-4 adult females at any one time, and a cohort of 7
   long-lived males overlapped an average of 16.4 females during their
   tenure on the grid. The period of maximum overlap with adult females
   varied among individual males. and did not correlate with the time of
   maximum body weight. Ranges of males in the dry season overlapped
   extensively, with persistent associations among some individuals. In the
   low-density year, ranges of some adults failed to overlap intersexually.
   Juvenile males dispersed gradually between 3 and 13 weeks of age (half
   before 9 weeks), with some leaving after reaching sexual maturity; a few
   remained philopatric. Of juvenile females, 47\% remained philopatric
   with the rest disappearing before 9 weeks of age. New understanding of
   vole social behavior, dispersal, and space use is achieved by focusing
   on the seasonal dynamics of spatial relationships among individuals with
   respect to age, sex, and relatedness.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how the population dynamics of the same bird species
   varied in different environments, and how the population dynamics of
   different species varied in the same environment, by calculating
   long-term trends for 59 insectivorous songbird species in 22 regions or
   strata of eastern and central North America using data from the North
   American Breeding Bird Survey. Of the 47 species that occurred in more
   than one region 77\% increased in some regions and declined in others.
   Of the 22 regions 91\% had some species that increased and others that
   decreased. There were only slightly more significant correlations
   between strata in species trends and between species for stratum trends
   than would be expected by chance. Because of nonlinearities in the data,
   the actual patterns of population fluctuations of the same species in
   different regions and of different species in the same region were even
   more heterogeneous than suggested by our analyses of linear trends. We
   conclude that these bird species respond to spatial and temporal
   variation in their environment in a very individualistic fashion. These
   individualistic responses show that the extrapolation of population
   trends gained from a few local studies to a larger spatial scale, and
   the use of a few indicator species to monitor the status of a broader
   community, are suspect.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclodiene insecticide resistance is associated with replacements of a
   single amino acid within the putative lining of a delta-aminobutyric
   acid (GABA)-gated chloride ion channel gene Resistance to dieldrin
   (Rdl). Only two resistance-associated amino acid replacements have been
   identified; alanine to serine in Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans,
   Aedes aegypti, and Tribolium castaneum and alanine to glycine as a
   second allele in D. simulans. Here we report that single stranded
   conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of genomic DNA, amplified by
   the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for exon 7 of the Rdl gene, can be
   used to genotype strains or individuals of all of these insects. This
   technique also appears simultaneously to distinguish between D.
   melanogaster and D. simulans, sibling species only reliably identifiable
   by examination of male genitalia. The relative advantages of this
   genotyping technique against other PCR-mediated techniques in monitoring
   for insecticide resistance are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal variation in force application of uni sized Asterias rubens
   on mussels of three different sizes was monitored by equipping mussel
   shells with electronic indicator devices and connecting them to a
   dynamometer. Three types of behaviour were observed. On small mussels a
   short pulse of approximate to 150 s was applied whereas on medium sized
   mussels the pulse exceeded 500 s. On large mussels a short pulse of
   approximate to 150 s was followed by a change in position to the dorsal
   side of the mussel. Sometimes a pulse was applied from this position.
   The maximum force during a pulse was between 7.6 and 70 N and not
   correlated to size of either mussel or starfish. Asterias seems to be
   able to respond to mussel size and morphology by changing its attack
   strategy. If the starfish is not able to open the mussel by a short
   force pulse or by exhaustion, it seems to use a siege strategy and wait
   out its prey. A high variability in mussel morphology was found between
   and within three different habitats in the North Sea. 70\% of Mytilus
   edulis of North Sea origin were able to resist the force applied by
   Asterias rubens whereas all mussels of Baltic Sea origin were opened
   within one hour. Differences in mussel height, muscle size and muscle
   attachment were found between surviving and non-surviving mussels. These
   differences can also be noted between habitats with high versus low
   predation pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The black sea urchin Diadema antillarum was until 1983 an important
   component of Caribbean coral reef communities, affecting the
   distribution and abundance of all major guilds of sedentary organisms.
   Between 1983 and 1984 this species suffered the most extensive and
   severe mass mortality ever recorded for a marine animal. Continuous
   monitoring in Panama shows that in the subsequent 10 years D. antillarum
   densities remained at < 3.5 \% of their pre-mortality levels. Despite
   pre-1983 evidence that D. antillarum competed with other echinoids,
   there has been no competitive release by other sea urchin species.
   Reef-wide inclusions and exclusions of echinoids indicate that: (i) the
   low rate of Diadema recruitment does not result from absence of
   settlement cues for the larvae or from lack of protection by conspecific
   adults but from paucity of larvae in the water column; and (ii)
   Echinometra viridis - an echinoid previously shown to compete with adult
   Diadema - actually facilitates the latter's recruitment. The lack of
   recovery of D. antillarum despite its high fecundity, planktonic larvae
   and the assistance of E. viridis, demonstrates that unique disturbance
   events in the history of a species can have long-lasting effects on its
   abundance, independently of community-level processes.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory-obtained veliger larvae of the bivalve Scrobicularia plana
   were used to test the toxicity of the antifoulant tributyltin (TBT) by
   means of a static renewal trial which monitored larval survival and
   growth as influenced by nominal TBT concentrations of 50, 125, 250 and
   500 ng Sn . 1(-1) during 10-day exposure. While S. plana veligers (mean
   initial shell length = 100 mu m) were found to develop to pediveligers
   (mean length = 230 mu m) in 10 days under control culture conditions,
   all levels of TBT tested significantly reduced the veliger growth rate
   (by a factor of greater than or equal to 2.7); probable lethal effects
   of nominal levels greater than or equal to 250 ng Sn . 1(-1) could not
   be demonstrated because of reduced larval survival in the solvent
   control. The results are discussed in relation to the widespread
   disappearance of S. plana in North Atlantic European estuaries during
   the 1980s and the concurrent TBT pollution in their waters. It is
   concluded that TBT has probably contributed to the reported demise of
   clam populations by preventing the successful and timely development of
   their veliger larvae.}},

Abstract = {{Bracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a gregarious parasitoid
   of phycitine moth larvae that infest stored grain. It has been
   hypothesized that B. hebetor females produce proportionately more female
   offspring under conditions of superparasitism (when laying eggs on
   previously parasitized hosts) because daughters are reproductively more
   valuable than sons when resources are limiting and adult body sizes are
   reduced. This hypothesis was reexamined by measuring the effects of body
   size on male and female performance and by monitoring the sex ratios and
   clutch sizes of individual females. The results of this study provide
   only weak evidence that small size differentially affects the
   reproductive success of male and female B. hebetor. Sex ratios were more
   female-biased on superparasitized hosts, but the difference arose as a
   consequence of two aspects of oviposition behaviour. First, male eggs
   were laid later within ovipositional sequences, and second; females laid
   smaller clutches when superparasitizing. A larger sex-ratio shift
   towards male progeny was seen, however, in females that committed
   ovicide (i.e. killed some of another's eggs by piercing them with the
   ovipositor). The offspring sex ratios of ovicidal females were much less
   female-biased because these females laid male eggs earlier in the
   ovipositional sequence. Ovicidal females shifted their sex ratios
   whether superparasitizing or ovipositing alone. None of the females
   killed their own eggs, even though they were observed probing among them
   with their ovipositors. It is hypothesized that oviposition behaviour
   and sex ratio in B. hebetor may be grouped into two syndromes: ovicidal
   and non-ovicidal. The variation in sex ratio and ovicide may be a
   consequence of density-dependent selection, favouring non-ovicidal
   behaviour when population density is low and ovicidal behaviour when the
   density is high and competition for larval resources is acute.}},

Abstract = {{Three sibling species of European small ermine moths of the Yponomeuta
   padella complex have been collected in North America.  To allow
   identification of fresh as well as dried specimens without host data, we
   examined these three species for diagnostic differences in their
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).  We report the sequence for a 2.3-kb region
   of mtDNA that includes the cytochrome oxidase I and II and transfer RNA
   (tRNA) leucine genes.  The mtDNA of Y. malinellus Zeller showed
   0.8-0.9\% divergence from that of the other two species, Y. padella (L.)
   and Y. cagnagella (Hubner).  The latter two species had divergences of
   only 0.0-0.2\%.  A survey of restriction sites in 44 collections
   demonstrated that Y. malinellus has distinct, diagnosable mtDNA in North
   America, whereas Y. padella and Y. cagnagella were not distinguished
   from each other by this method.  The recent establishment and range
   expansion of Y. malinellus and Y. padella in western North America is
   currently being monitored by pheromone traps that potentially have some
   degree of cross-attraction.  Restriction sites in amplified mtDNA should
   allow rapid confirmation of species identities of such dried
   collections.  The method used to generate the particular diagnostic
   reported here can be expanded readily to include new species and
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{1. Hong Kong has suffered from gross water pollution, as a direct
   consequence of the territory's rapid growth in population and in
   industrial and commercial prosperity. In 1989, the government of Hong
   Kong adopted a comprehensive strategy for water pollution control. Water
   quality monitoring is essential to the success of this strategy.
   2. The monitoring programme was designed rationally to provide the
   information required to detect progress towards (or away from) water
   quality objectives. Practical constraints have prevented the ideal
   implementation but the programme gives comprehensive coverage of marine
   waters, including bathing beaches and inland waters.
   3. Sampling and analytical methods are an important part of programme
   design, to ensure that the programme yields accurate and consistent
   data. Presentation and interpretation also need to be taken into
   account. More effort on interpretation of a well-designed survey can
   reduce the effort required for sampling and analysis.
   4. Examples show how the monitoring programme has been used for
   practical environmental management purposes, including the control of
   dredging operations, the justification of new sewage disposal
   facilities, and the control of waste from the livestock industry.}},

Abstract = {{Site- and season-specific regressions of particulates less than 10 mu in

   throughout California during years when both were monitored. The
   regressions were then applied to monitored TSPs for the years 1973 to
   1987, and indirect estimates of PM(10) were formed. These estimates of
   PM(10) were validated by interporating them to other monitoring
   stations. The split-halves correlation between the estimated and
   monitored mean concentrations, obtained when both were first cumulated
   for a 2-y period, was .86. Indirect estimates of PM(10) at monitoring
   stations were interpolated, by month, to zip code centroids of home and
   work location and were cumulated for a cohort of 3 914 California
   Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) nonsmokers. Multivariate analyses, adjusted
   for several covariates, showed statistically significant (p < .05), but
   small, positive associations between PM(10) and development of (a)
   definite symptoms of overall airway obstructive disease, (b) chronic
   productive cough, and (c) increased severity of airway obstructive
   disease and asthma. The relative risk (RR) associated with 1 000 h/y (42

   development of airway obstructive disease was 1.17 (95\% confidence

   RR was 1.21 (CI 1.02, 1.44); and for development of asthma, the RR was
   1.30 (CI, 0.97, 1.73). Stronger associations were observed for those who
   were exposed occupationally to dusts and fumes. The RR of developing
   airway obstructive disease as an adult for those who had airway
   obstructive disease as a child was 1.66 (CI 1.15, 2.33).}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in water chemistry and periphytic diatom assemblages
   were monitored for a saline, a subsaline, and a freshwater lake in the
   central Yukon Territory.  Athalassic saline lakes, such as these, are
   believed to be extremely rare in arctic regions.  All three study lakes
   exhibited a gradual shoreline retreat over the season (28 May to 22
   August 1992) due to evaporative water loss.  As the season progressed,
   the saline lake exhibited a marked increase in conductivity and
   salinity, similar to changes observed for inland salt lakes in more
   southern regions.  The seasonal changes in water chemistry were less
   pronounced in the subsaline and freshwater lakes.  The periphytic diatom
   populations of the saline lake closely tracked changes in the lake's
   salinity, exhibiting a successional shift from taxa with low salt
   tolerances (e.g., Nitzschia cf. commutata and N. cf. palea) to those
   with high salt tolerances (e.g., Amphora acutiuscula) over the study
   period.  Periphytic diatoms in the subsaline and freshwater lakes also
   exhibited marked successional changes, shifting to almost complete
   dominance by a single species (Cocconeis placentula and Achnanthes
   minutissima respectively), but these shifts were not related to lake
   water salinity alone.}},

Abstract = {{One group of biological tools that are useful for monitoring exposure to
   xenobiotics (and hence water quality) have been collectively referred to
   as biomarkers and are defined in this paper as any biochemical,
   histological and/or physiological alterations or manifestations of
   stress. Biomarkers within an aquatic toxicological context generally
   represent biological responses of individual organisms to xenobiotic
   exposure (i.e. responses at the whole organism level of biological
   organization) These include among others, enzyme alterations, bile
   metabolites, RNA/DNA ratio, adenylate energy charge, skeletal
   abnormalities, immune dysfunction, behavioural changes and
   histopathological lesions. Biomarkers can act as effective early warning
   sentinels ro ensure the protection of the integrity of whole ecosystems,
   including freshwater and
   This paper briefly reviews a selection of fish biomarkers of xenobiotic
   chemical exposure and marine ecosystems discusses their respective
   strengths and limitations for use in biomonitoring. An example of the

   P-LSO as biomarkers of chemical exposure in Port Phillip Bay is provided
   it is concluded that judicious application oi biomarkers such as MFO in

Abstract = {{A brief account is given of the methods developed for use of algae,
   bryophytes and angiosperms to monitor rivers and streams. The methods
   fall broadly into those based on features of populations of
   representative species, those based on part or all of the whole
   photosynthetic community and those based on various types of bioassay
   and ecotoxicological test. The methodology for using bioaccumulation of
   heavy metals, insecticides and other organic molecules is well developed
   and has been applied widely in western Europe for practical purposes.
   Coarse filamentous algae and bryophytes are especially useful, but some
   angiosperms are suitable, provided general information about
   bioaccumulation in the particular species is available; it is difficult
   to use periphyton. Other methods based on species include measurement of
   genetic tolerance, physiological approaches (chlorophyll: phaeophytin
   ratio, tissue N:P ratio and surface phosphatase assays) and observations
   on cyanobacterial and eukaryotic algal morphology.
   Among community-based methods for monitoring, measurement of biomass is
   used widely for phytoplankton, but seems of little use for benthos. The
   use of indices based on benthic communities, especially diatoms, has,
   however, been applied widely. The earlier indices based on diversity
   have been replaced almost entirely by ones integrating ecological
   information from component species. In addition, the authors have
   started to produce a diatom-based parallel to the
   macroinvertebrate-based RIVPACS by obtaining floristic data from `clean'
   sites. Bioassays and ecological tests, mainly using algae or Lemna, are
   often carried out together with the other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Biological monitoring programmes for environmental protection should
   provide for both early detection of possible adverse effects, and
   assessment of the ecological significance of these effects. Monitoring
   techniques are required that include responses sensitive to the impact,
   that can be subjected to rigorous statistical analysis and for which
   statistical power is high. Such issues in baseline research of `what and
   how to measure?' and `for how long?' have been the focus of a programme
   being developed to monitor and assess effects of mining operations on
   the essentially pristine, freshwater ecosystems of the Alligator Rivers
   Region (ARR) in tropical northern Australia. Application of the BACIP
   (Before, After, Control, Impact, Paired differences) design, utilizing a
   form of temporal replication, to univariate (single species) and
   multivariate (community) data is described. The BACIP design
   incorporates data from single control and impact sites. We argue for
   modification of the design for particular studies conducted in streams,
   to incorporate additional independent control sites from adjacent
   catchments. Inferential power, by way of(i) more confidently attributing
   cause to an observed change and (ii) providing information about the
   ecological significance of the change, will be enhanced using a modified
   BACIP design. In highly valued environments such as the ARR, monitoring
   programmes require application of statistical tests with high power to
   guarantee that an impact no greater than a prescribed amount has gone
   undetected. A minimum number of baseline years using the BACIP approach
   would therefore be required in order to achieve some desired level of
   statistical power. We describe the results of power analyses conducted
   on 2-5 years (depending upon the technique) of baseline data from
   streams of the ARR and discuss the implications of these results for
   management.}},

   RESULTS OF A DISTURBANCE EXPERIMENT AND THE DESIGN OF A MULTIVARIATE
   BACIP MONITORING PROGRAM AT CORONATION HILL, NORTHERN-TERRITORY}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate methods for the detection of impacts on communities are:
   (i) explored in the context of a disturbance experiment at a site of
   previous uranium mining in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory; and
   (ii) applied to the design of a monitoring programme for a proposed
   mining development at nearby Coronation Hill. The disturbance experiment
   in Rockhole Mine Creek used a gravity-fed redirection of polluted water
   from the mine adit to create a point-source pollutant. Weekly samples of
   the macroinvertebrate communities were taken both before and after
   disturbance at the control and `impact' site, as part of a multivariate
   BACIP (Before-After-Control-Imp act-Pairs) design. The results of the
   experiment show that the multivariate approach provided high sensitivity
   in detecting impacts on the community, with little difference in
   sensitivity between species and family level analyses. A simple
   procedure for deleting those taxa that show poor discrimination between
   pristine and presently disturbed areas further increased the sensitivity
   of the tests. In addition to the BACIP analyses, robust ordination of
   the community data suggested a time/treatment interaction effect.
   Application of the multivariate BACIP approach also was explored using
   baseline data for benthic communities from the South Alligator River
   near Coronation Kill. The method provides high statistical power for
   monitoring; a relatively small change in community dissimilarity would
   be detectable in a programme with 5 years of observations before and
   after commencement of mining. A robust ordination of the yearly samples
   for the control and potential-impact sites showed that, although samples
   varied along identifiable gradients over time, the two areas changed in
   parallel so that the difference between the areas was approximately
   constant over years. This result demonstrates that the multivariate
   BACIP approach can provide relative constancy of pre-impact difference
   values, a key requirement of BACIP designs that is difficult to satisfy
   using abundance data for a single species.}},

Abstract = {{Biological methods are widely accepted in water quality monitoring
   programmes worldwide; however, some concern remains over their
   effectiveness in predicting the effects of contaminants on aquatic
   ecosystems. While the so-called `early warning' approaches, such as
   bioassays and biomarkers, have been used in Australia to demonstrate
   mechanisms of toxic action and exposure to contaminants, as elsewhere,
   little attempt has been made to link observed effects at these lower
   levels of biological organization to real impacts on aquatic systems.
   The ecological consequences of exposure to contaminants is undoubtedly
   best studied at higher levels of biological organization (i.e. at the
   population or community level). However, monitoring aquatic communities
   is labour intensive and inadequate for the early detection of impacts.
   Research is needed to identify links between the bioassessment measures
   used, so that changes at the lowest biological level (e.g. using
   biomarkers and bioassays) can be translated into likely `real' impacts
   on the aquatic system, as measured at the population or community level.
   Monitoring the genetic structure of populations of aquatic organisms,
   particularly invertebrates, may provide a potential link between subtle
   effects observed in bioassay tests and subsequent changes in population
   density and/or community structure. A streamlined approach to monitoring
   changes at the community level needs to be developed to improve
   predictive ability and to make this approach more responsive to the
   early detection and prevention of unacceptable impacts. In addition,
   research on the use of ecosystem level parameters. such as
   production/respiration ratios or community metabolism, should be
   undertaken to determine their suitability for routine biomonitoring of
   water quality in Australian inland waters.}},
