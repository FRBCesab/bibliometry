Abstract = {{The coastal areas of Eastern African are the centers for economic growth
   in most of the countries in the region. Migration toward the coast and
   population growth, together with overuse of resources and widespread
   poverty, contribute to the degradation of coastal environments. During
   the last decade a number of local-level projects have been carried out
   in the region to improve coastal development and management. This
   article discusses the experiences and lessons learned from many of these
   projects. Overall, the degree of success of these projects has been
   mixed. Projects focusing on biodiversity protection, but neglecting
   local development are often only successful in the short term. An
   important concern is that most projects are completely dependent on
   donor support and are thus far from sustainable. To be successful over
   the long term, local and national ownership is critical and has to be
   improved. Legal and regulatory frameworks are still poorly developed and
   enforcement of regulations is weak at best. The article discusses the
   need for research and capacity building to support coastal management
   projects; the role of monitoring and evaluation; and the importance of
   better communication. Project experiences with community participation
   are presented. It is noted that coastal managers have not yet fully
   recognized that private enterprise is the single most important factor
   driving change along the coastline of the region. In conclusion, the
   experiences gained over the last 10 years of ICZM in Eastern Africa
   indicate that projects directly targeted at the local level with
   activities planned and carried out in cooperation with local
   stakeholders have a relatively high degree of success.}},

Title = {{Trends in the types, amounts, and toxicity of pesticides used in
   Tanzania - Efforts to control pesticide pollution in Zanzibar, Tanzania}},
Journal = {{AMBIO}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{669-676}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The amount of pesticides used in Tanzania increased from 330 g
   capita(-1) in 1977 to 500 g capita(-1) in 1988. With population growth
   at 2.7\%, this implies a significant increase (140\%) in pesticide use.
   The control of importation, formulation, and use of pesticides is
   inefficient. Imported amounts can exceed the authorized amounts, because
   of donations and the specific projects that import pesticides without
   official authority from the licensing agent (Tropical Pesticides
   Research Institute). The types of pesticides used in Zanzibar have
   changed significantly over the last 10 years. The more toxic pesticides
   have been phased out and replaced by less toxic ones. The pesticides
   used decreased from 13 tons in 1990 to about 2 tons in 1995. Among the
   reasons for the decreases are the efforts by the Plant Protection
   Department and the Ministry of Agriculture to support a more organic
   form of agriculture, and the removal of government subsidies on
   agrochemicals. The pesticides discussed here are those ordered by the
   Plant Protection Department (90\% of all the pesticides used in
   Zanzibar). Pesticides are also ordered by the public health sectors and
   by individuals. However, the malaria project, the main source in the
   public health sector was stopped in 1989. Private importation is for
   only a few types of pesticides. Monitoring of what is being sold by
   individuals is poor, despite the fact that all chemicals imported should
   be registered. This paper discusses pesticide use in Tanzania with
   emphasis on the trends in types and amounts of pesticides used in
   Zanzibar for the last 10 years and implications for the marine
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Gall formation in Prionitis laceolata is associated with a specific
   eubacterium (Proteobacteria {[}alpha subclass], Rhodobacter grouping),
   which, typical of bacterial symbionts, has not yet been cultivated or
   isolated in pure culture. This investigation tested the hypothesis that
   P. laceolata gall formation was caused by the associated eubacterium
   using a species-specific rDNA probe (S-S-P.l.sym-0949-a-A-25) to
   identify and assay for symbiont presence during consecutive laboratory
   induction trials. Gall induction was quantified and whole-cell in situ
   hybridization used to determine the relative percentage of symbiotic
   eubacteria in inoculation homogenates. In situ hybridization of
   symbionts in sections allowed localization and monitoring of this
   microbe during gall development. Induction trial results indicate a
   significant correlation between bacterial symbiont presence and gall
   initiation (P = 0.00005). The gall bacterium comprised the majority of
   the eubacteria hybridized in laboratory induction homogenates
   (85-97\%?), in galls induced in the laboratory and in three algal
   populations in nature. The evidence presented here demonstrates the
   causative role of the identified eubacterium in gall induction and
   formation. This investigation is significant in the application of
   molecular methods towards understanding the roles of noncultivable
   marine bacteria in marine algal-microbe interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between colony area and population density of Adelie
   penguins Pygoscelis adeliae was examined to determine whether colony
   area, measured from aerial or satellite imagery, could be used to
   estimate population density, and hence detect changes in populations

   penguin colonies in the Mawson region, pair density ranged between 0.1
   and 3.1 pairs m(-2), with a mean of 0.63 +/- 0.3 pairs m(-2). Colony
   area explained 96.4\% of the variance in colony populations (range
   90.4-99.6\%) for 979 colonies at Mawson. Mean densities were not
   significantly different among the 19 islands in the region, but
   significant differences in mean pair density were observed among
   colonies in Mawson, Whitney Point (Casey, East Antarctica) and Cape
   Crozier (Ross Sea) populations. The relationship between colony area and
   population may be locality- and/or species-specific, and a robust data
   set is required to validate the relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian life histories suggest that maternal body condition and social
   dominance (a measure of resource-holding potential) influence the
   physical and social development of offspring, and thereby their
   reproductive success. Predictably, a mother should produce that sex of
   offspring which contributes most to her fitness (as measured by the
   number of her grandchildren) and that she is best able to raise within
   the constraints imposed by her condition, social rank, and environment.
   Such combined effects were investigated by monitoring variations in body
   condition (weight) and behavior of female toque macaques, Macccca sinica
   of Sri Lanka, in a changing forest environment over 18 years. Maternal
   rank, by itself, had no influence on offspring sex, but did affect
   maternal body condition. The combined effects of rank and condition
   indicated the following: mothers in robust condition bore more sons,
   whereas those in moderate condition bore more daughters, but both
   effects were expressed most strongly among mothers of high rank. Where
   the consequences of low rank were felt most acutely, as shown by poor
   condition, mothers underproduced daughters. Environmental quality
   directly influenced rank and condition interactions, and thus sex
   ratios. These relationships, and data from other mammals suggest an
   empirically and theoretically consistent pattern of sex allocation in
   mammals. New predictions integrate effects, proposed by Trivers and
   Willard, that are rooted in male mate competition, which is universal
   among polygynous mammals, with those of local resource competition
   (and/or female reproductive competition), which are not universal and
   differ in intensity between the socioecologies and local environments of
   different species.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a mark-recapture study to evaluate short-term movements of
   the endangered American burying beetle Nicrophorus americanus. We found
   that beetles moving between sites averaged 1.23 km night(-1) in their
   search for carrion (n = 23 movements between sites) with a range from
   0.25 km for I night to a maximum of 10.0 km over 6 nights. In support of
   the supposition that American burying beetles are generalists in their
   search for carrion, we observed individual beetles moving between
   different habitat types (71\% of recaptures were in a habitat different
   from that of the previous site of capture), including movements between
   grassland and woodlands, as well as between bottomland and upland
   woodlands. No differences in recapture rates were detected between males
   and females, or between teneral and fully sclerotized beetles. No
   beetles were recaptured between trapping sessions within a few weeks of
   one another within the same year, or from 1 year to the next. The
   relatively long distances that individual beetles move and the
   potentially short residency time should be taken into account when
   evaluating data from monitoring of extant populations and when devising
   plans to establish new ones. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The grey seal breeding assemblies on the Inishkea Island Group and
   Blasket Islands in western Ireland were studied in 1995 and 1996. A
   census of pup production in each area provided data on the timing of
   breeding and site selection at these island groups in addition to birth
   and mortality parameters. An estimated 154 pups were born at the
   Inishkea Group in 1995 and 155 pups at the Blasket Islands in 1996-97.
   These figures correspond to minimum all-age population estimates of
   539-693 and 543-697 animals, respectively. These minimum estimates are
   similar to those derived in previous work at these islands, suggesting
   little change in the breeding population size at these colonies since
   1983. Observed mortality was approximately 7.8\% at the Inishkea Group
   and 2.6\% at the Blasket Islands, though the true mortality may have
   been higher. Changes in breeding site use since 1980-83 were observed at
   the Inishkea Group in 1995. These are thought to be a result of past
   human interference. More effective coverage of the breeding season and
   long-term monitoring of these sites would contribute more accurate
   estimates and facilitate the determination of population trends.}},

Abstract = {{In West Africa different insecticides had been applied in selected river
   areas for the reduction of the blackfly populations vectors of
   Onchocerca volvulus, a parasite causing blindness. To evaluate the
   possible long term effects of the larvicides on the non target fauna an
   aquatic monitoring programme has been up from the initial phase of the
   project. Addressing the attention to the invertebrates data collected in
   four countries during a maximum period ranging from 1977 to 1996, this
   paper shows and discusses the data analysis strategy for the measure and
   interpretation of the biological variation. In particular the
   application of quantitative ecological analysis methods: Principal
   Component Analysis, rank abundance models and the community diversity
   indexes, is critically discussed and comments are given to the

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the potential for clearcutting to fragment
   habitat of area-sensitive, for est-dependent mammals such as American
   marten (Martes americana). We examined relationships among measures of
   landscape pattern and spatial use of habitat by 33 resident and 32
   nonresident, adult marten that were I radio-monitored in an extensively
   logged landscape Size and distribution of forest patches (trees over 6
   nz in height) were associated with patch use by marten. Patches of
   forest used by resident marten (median = 27 ha n = 12) were larger (p <
   0.003) than patches with no observed use (median = 1.5 ha n = 128).
   Further, patches used by residents were closer to the nearest patch
   larger than 2.7 ha (38 nz versus 55 nz; p = 0.057) and to an adjacent
   forest preserve (2.5 km versus 3.5 km; p = 0.075) than patches with no
   observed rue. At four spatial scales (10, 65, 125, and 250 ha), grid
   cells used by resident marten comprised a greater percentage of residual
   forest over 6 in in height (p less than or equal to 0.008) and
   intersected forest patches of greater area (p less than or equal to
   0.006) than cells with no observed use. Edge indices were not different
   (p greater than or equal to 0.490) between used grid cells and cells;
   with no observed use at any of the four spatial scales. Analyses of
   forest edge associations indicated that marten did not avoid
   residual-regenerating forest edge within home ranges or within the study
   area. Home ranges (n = 27) of all resident adult marten were composed of
   more than 60\% forest cover over 6 m in height; median values were
   78-80\% for both sexes. The median size of the largest forest patch in
   marten home ranges was 150 ha for females and 247 ha for males Our
   results suggest that reducing fragmentation by consolidating clearcuts
   and retaining large residual patches would help to maintain resident
   marten in extensively logged landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Despite move than two decades of conservation efforts only limited
   information is available on the metapopulation structure of the tiger
   (Panthera tigris). We report on the geographic distribution of tigers in
   Nepal in relation to habitat quality and describe an inventory and
   monitoring system that can be applied across the entire range of the
   species Using information from previous studies, interviews with local
   people, and digital thematic mapper satellite data, we identified four
   populations of tigers three occur primarily within the borders of Nepal,
   and a fourth is across the border in India. We estimate that there are
   153 breeding tigers in these four populations. in the Chitwan population
   77\% of breeding tigers live in three protected areas; the rest occupy
   national forests. Tigers in all four populations survive in isolated
   forest remnants of what was once a continuous subtropical forest zone
   lying south of the Himalayas. Within central Nepal the ratio of good- to
   poor-quality, tiger habitat ranged from 16\% to 86\% across seven forest
   districts. The four areas with the highest ratio of good-quality,
   habitat (>54\%) supported breeding populations, one area with a marginal
   ratio of good-quality habitat (46\%) was used only occasionally, and the
   two areas with the lowest ratio of good-quality habitat (<26\%) were not
   used by tigers. We suggest that when the ratio of good to poor habitat
   drops below approximately 50\%, tigers no longer breed when it drops
   below 30\%, tigers no longer occur in an area. Estimates of potential
   tiger habitat and data on habitat used by tigers demonstrate the need to
   expand current management beyond parks to encompass the entire land base
   supporting these fragmented populations so that small tiger-populations
   can be managed as ecosystem or tiger management units rather than as
   portions of population within protected areas.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of deer hunting by humans on deer population dynamics and
   behavior may indirectly affect the population dynamics and behavior of
   deer predators We present data on the effects of hunting on the behavior
   of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on the Osceola National
   Forest, a potential reintroduction site for the endangered Florida
   panther (Felis concolor coryi). We then use this information to
   formulate and recommend testable hypotheses to investigate whether these
   changes in deer behavior influence panther movements, mortality: and
   hunting success. We monitored 14 radio-collared deer front June 1990
   through July 1991 to compare movement activity, and habitat-use patterns
   between the hunting and non-hunting seasons. Mean distance of deer to
   the nearest road, mean distance of activity centers of diel home ranges
   to the nearest road, and mean nocturnal rate of activity were gr eater
   during the hunting than the nonhunting seasons. During the hunting
   season, deer avoided clearcuts, young pine plantations (4-10 years old),
   and other open habitats and preferred su,amp and mature pine forests,
   both of which provided cover. These results suggest that deer responded
   to hunter disturbance by moving away from roads and increasing nocturnal
   activity Although recreational deer hunting may reduce the prey base for
   panthers the changes we observed in deer behavior during the hunting
   season may benefit panthers in the following ways: (I) an increase in
   nocturnal activity and movement away from roads by deer into areas
   frequented by panthers may increase prey availability for panther's; (2)
   the movement of deer away from roads may in turn draw panthers away from
   om roads, which may decrease the chance of panthers being killed by
   vehicular traffic or poachers.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effect of fishing on the density, biomass,
   species richness and overall structure of the reef fish community at two
   islands (Sumilon and Ape) in the Philippines from 1983 to 1993. A series
   of natural fishing experiments over this period involving marine
   reserves were monitored at each island, where estimates of fishing
   intensity and selectivity were available. Fishing intensity (15\% and
   25\% of biomass removed per year at Sumilon and Ape, respectively) was
   high enough to affect total community biomass, but not density,
   significantly. Species richness was not affected significantly by
   fishing, except at Sumilon reserve. The fishery was relatively
   non-selective with most families/trophic groups caught roughly in
   proportion to their contribution to community biomass. Thus fishing did
   not alter the relative abundance of the major families/trophic groups
   significantly, except during a period of use of explosives and drive
   nets in the Sumilon reserve. At the level of family/trophic group the
   community displayed strong resilience of structure. There was little
   evidence of secondary effects e.g, declines in abundance of large
   predators resulting in measurable increases in abundance of their prey.
   This resilience of the community to the effects of fishing most likely
   results from three important community attributes (open nature of the
   component populations, likely maintenance of upstream recruitment supply
   and apparent lack of any obvious ``keystone{''} species or families) and
   one important characteristic of the fishery (relatively non-selective
   with respect to the components of the community).}},

Abstract = {{Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) in the South Shetland
   Islands are recovering from 19th-century exploitation more slowly than
   the main population at South Georgia. To document demographic changes
   associated with the recovery in the South Shetlands, we monitored fur
   seal abundance and reproduction in the vicinity of Elephant Island
   during austral summers from 1986/1987 through 1994/1995. Total births,
   mean and variance of birth dates, and average daily mortality rates were
   estimated from daily live pup counts at North Cove (NC) and North Annex
   (NA) colonies on Seal Island. Sightings of leopard seals (Hydrurga
   leptonyx) and incidents of leopard seal predation on fur seal pups were
   recorded opportunistically during daily fur seal research at both sites.
   High mortality of fur seal pups, attributed to predation by leopard
   seals frequently observed at NC, caused pup numbers to decline rapidly
   between January and March (i.e., prior to weaning) each year and
   probably caused a long-term decline in the size of that colony. The NA
   colony, where leopard seals were never observed, increased in size
   during the study. Pup mortality from causes other than leopard seal
   predation appeared to be similar at the two sites. The number of pups
   counted at four locations in the Elephant Island vicinity increased
   slowly, at an annual rate of 3.8\%, compared to rates as high as 11\% at
   other locations in the South Shetland Islands. Several lines of
   circumstantial evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that leopard
   seal predators limit the growth of the fur seal population in the
   Elephant Island area and perhaps in the broader population in the South
   Shetland Islands. The sustained growth of this fur seal population over
   many decades rules out certain predator-prey models, allowing inference
   about the interaction between leopard seals and fur seals even though it
   is less thoroughly studied than predator-prey systems of terrestrial
   vertebrates of the northern hemisphere. Top-down forces should be
   included in hypotheses for future research on the factors shaping the
   recovery of the fur seal population in the South Shetland Islands.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports evidence for family effects (i.e., nonindependence
   between siblings) on components of juvenile fitness in two
   high-performance populations of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). In Trois
   Fontaines (eastern France), 51 sets of twins were ear-tagged as newborns
   and then intensively monitored until adulthood (to greater than or equal
   to 4 yr of age). On the island of Storfosna (central western Norway), 79
   sets of twins and 40 sets of triplets were radiotracked from birth to
   greater than or equal to 1 mo of age. In both populations, family
   effects were observed for measures of early body development and winter
   body mass. Measurements for sibling fawns were more similar than the
   same measures for nonsiblings. During unfavorable years (i.e., poor deer
   survival in summer or high population density), sibling fawns survived
   or died together much more often than expected by chance. Conversely,
   during favorable years (i.e., high fawn survival or low density), there
   was no evidence for family effects on survival of either twins or
   triplets. These results demonstrate that family effects on juvenile
   fitness of roe deer are pervasive, and that family effects on early
   survival differ among years. To assess the consequences of family
   effects an population dynamics, we tested the model of J. F. Crow and N.
   E. Morton. This model proposes that family effects should cause
   increased variance in recruitment among females. Consistent with this
   model, Family effects led to a threefold increase in the variance of
   total reproductive success over 5 yr of 37 females in Trois Fontaines.
   Data from Storfosna (11 females monitored for 3 yr) also supported Crow
   and Morton's model. Ultimately, family effects in polytocous species
   could reduce the intensity of sexual selection and modify the genetic
   structure of populations.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of breeding habitat may cause declines in many bird
   populations. Our perception of the demographic effects of habitat
   fragmentation comes primarily from studies in the midwestern and eastern
   United States and Scandinavia. We know very little about the demographic
   effects of anthropogenically caused habitat fragmentation in habitats
   prone to natural disturbance, as is typical of most forest types in the
   western United States. We located and monitored 1916 nests on eight
   sites located in mostly forested landscapes and eight sites located in
   primarily agricultural landscapes to study the effects of
   landscape-level fragmentation on nest predation and brood parasitism in
   riparian areas in western Montana.
   Patterns of nest predation were opposite those documented from more
   eastern locales; predation rates were higher in forested landscapes than
   in fragmented landscapes dominated by agriculture. This pattern probably
   reflects the importance of forest predators in these landscapes: red
   squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were much more abundant in forested
   landscapes and declined quickly with decreasing forest cover, whereas
   predators that typically increase in fragmented landscapes in the
   Midwest (such as corvids) increased only at very high levels of
   fragmentation. Patch size and distance to habitat edge did not influence
   predation rates. Brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus
   ater) decreased with increasing forest cover, but the strongest
   predictors of parasitism were the abundance of human development (farms
   and houses) on the landscape and the density of cowbird host species,
   not forest cover. The combined effects of predation and parasitism
   resulted in low nesting productivity in both forested and agricultural
   landscapes for heavily parasitized species, while the species not
   affected by cowbird parasitism had greater nesting productivity in
   fragmented agricultural landscapes. Our results suggest that the effects
   of fragmentation are dependent on the habitat structure, the landscape
   context, the predator community, and the impact of parasitism. All of
   these factors may differ substantially in western ecosystems when
   compared to previously studied forests, making generalizations about the
   effect of fragmentation difficult.}},

Abstract = {{The western newer thrips, Frankliniella occidantalis (Pergande), has
   been present on Reunion Island since 1987. The tomato spotted wilt
   virus, which is transmitted by F. occidentalis, was first observed on
   the island in 1991. Because of the strong threat to newer crops, we
   studied western flower thrips dynamics at a newer farm (900 m elevation)
   from 1993 to 1997. The population dynamics were monitored using sticky
   traps. The density of western newer thrips was studied through
   auto-correlograms and cross-correlograms with climatic data
   (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall). Thrips populations varied
   annually, typically due to temperature variation. Stepwise regression
   allowed us to fit a model of density increment including 2 climatic
   parameters: ln (R) at lag = 0 and H at lag = -3 (with R for rainfall,
   and H for relative humidity; 1 lag = 15 d) and auto-regressive moving
   average terms for residuals. It appeared the western Bower thrips was
   present all year round on the site but density started to increase when
   temperatures reached 15 degrees C. Nevertheless, the density decreased
   before the mean temperature reached its maximum. Heavy rainfall,
   involving submergence of pupae or high relative humidity, conditions
   which are favorable to an entomopathogen, could explain this early
   decrease.}},

Abstract = {{A monitoring system established within an array of cultivated and
   uncultivated habitats was used to characterize the first 5 yr of
   establishment of the erotic multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia
   axyridis (Pallas), in an agricultural landscape of southwestern
   Michigan. Population trends over time were summarized for ii species of
   resident coccinellids before and after the arrival of H. axyridis. In
   addition, annual population increase, habitat utilization patterns, and
   within-season population fluctuation for H. axyridis were analyzed H.
   axyridis became a dominant coccinellid species in the landscape 4 yr
   after its arrival. Adults of this species were found in all habitats
   monitored, including early secondary succession, poplar plantation,
   alfalfa, soybean, corn, and winter wheat. Significant population peaks
   were observed early and late in the season, depending on the habitat.
   Resident species that appear affected by the establishment of H.
   axyridis are Brachiacantha ursina (F.), Cycloneda munda (Say), and
   Chilocorus stigma (Say). However, to attribute the decline on the
   numbers of those species to H. axyridis will require further assessment.}},

Title = {{Scientific sampling effects: Electrofishing California's endangered fish
   populations}},
Journal = {{FISHERIES}},
Year = {{1998}},

Abstract = {{Standard methods used by biologists around the world for sampling fish
   populations and determining fish and habitat relationships primarily
   involve electrofishing. With the recent listings of mining fish and
   habitat relationships primarily involve electrofishing. with the recent
   listings of coastal salmon and steelhead as threatened or endangered,
   one must ask how electrofishing-induced injury to fish in rare
   populations relates to ``take{''} under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
   Issues related to electrofishing are under discussion in California as
   federal and state agencies determine how to approach permitting for
   monitoring and research activities in rivers containing protected fish
   populations. Many problems have been discussed in the literature based
   on short- and long-term injury to individual fish from different forms
   of electrofishing. To date no standard approach for this technology
   exists that will allow effective surveys without probable injury to some
   portion of the fish population. How electrofishing injuries made at the
   individual fish level translate into population effects has not been
   adequately studied. In many areas of central and southern California,
   however, where the numbers of salmon and trout can be very small, and
   effective population size is frequently less than 25 breeding pairs,
   accumulated effects due to electrofishing may be significant. This paper
   reviews the electrofishing literature published during the last nine
   years. Based on this review and personal experience, I belie iie
   fisheries biologists frequently electrofish without considering
   potential harm or alternative methods. Therefore, I suggest the American
   Fisheries Society (AFS) develop a set of guidelines for least-invasive
   sampling methodologies, and adopt a policy on the ethical use of
   electrofishing for use by federal or state agencies to regulate all
   electrofishing activities in habitats containing wild fish. I believe
   other noninvasive study methods should be required in areas where it can
   be shown that electrofishing may significantly reduce a population's
   ability to persist.}},

Abstract = {{Previous study of Cupressaceae pollen in the Tulsa atmosphere during
   December and January suggested that the source of this pollen is the
   Juniperus ashei (mountain cedar) populations that occur mainly in
   southern Oklahoma and central Texas. The present investigation examined
   the evidence of long-distance transport of pollen from these populations
   during the 1996/1997 season at three sites in Oklahoma using Burkard
   traps. Two of the pollen-monitoring stations were operated in
   conjunction with Mesonet meteorological stations. It was found that the
   December and January Cupressaceae pollen occurs outside of the local
   season at Tulsa. Pollen concentrations are intermittent and correspond
   to days of peak concentrations at sites nearer the mountain cedar
   populations. Peak concentrations are associated with winds coming from
   the south over the mountain cedar areas. Diurnal rhythms show night-time
   peaks with a delay in timing at the northern-most site. These results
   are all consistent with the hypothesis that pollen is being transported
   over long distances from the mountain cedar populations to Tulsa,
   Oklahoma. These findings are important as they represent one of the few
   incidences of long-distance transport of pollen in significant
   concentrations to an area where the source vegetation is not present.
   Pollen-monitoring sites located in conjunction with Mesonet
   meteorological stations provide a unique opportunity to further examine
   atmospheric conditions during long-distance transport events. This will
   aid future studies of the spatial modeling of long-distance dispersal of
   pollen.}},

Title = {{Predicting the determinants of weed abundance: a model for the
   population dynamics of Chenopodium album in sugar beet}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{1. Previously published literature on the population dynamics of a
   common arable weed, Chenopodium album, and its interactions with an
   arable crop, sugar beet, is reviewed with a view to (i) assessing the
   degree of variability in life-history traits, and (ii) parameterizing
   simple models of population dynamics to explore the factors determining
   weed abundance.
   2. Comparison of previously published data sets indicates that (i) the
   yield-density responses of C. album in monoculture are remarkably
   consistent across sites and years; (ii) the per plant interspecific
   competitive effect of sugar beet on C. album is roughly the same as the
   per plant intraspecific effect of C. album; (iii) the allometric
   relationship between the seed production of C. album and plant biomass
   is invariant: and (iv) there is considerable variation in published
   estimates of rates of seed emergence, mortality and seedbank decay.
   3. These data are used to parameterize a simple analytical model for the
   population dynamics of C. album in a rotation containing sugar beet.
   Sensitivity analysis indicates that the key parameters in determining
   changes in population size are the rates of emergence and mortality of
   seeds, as well as the rate of mortality of plants through control.
   4. Using inferred levels of variability to compare deterministic and
   stochastic implementations of the model indicates that population sizes,
   and variability in population sizes, will be dominated by
   environmentally driven variations in the rate of seed germination and
   the rate of control.
   5. From a practical perspective, these results indicate that (i) further
   information on the effects of control on plant numbers, and (ii)
   monitoring and prediction of emergence rates is likely to be the most
   successful approach to predicting weed numbers and levels of
   infestation.
   6. The modelling shows how it is possible to use existing published data
   to parameterize simple analytical models, as well as to use information
   on scales of parameter variability with sensitivity analysis of such
   models to explore population dynamics. This provides an effective basis
   for exploring the impact of changing management on weed numbers in
   variable environments.}},

Abstract = {{1. We evaluated the reliability of aerial surveys to monitor trends in
   breeding population density of ptarmigan Lagopus spp. in south-western
   Yukon, Canada.
   2. Aerial surveys provided repeatable indices of density.
   3. Aerial indices of density were positively and linearly related to
   density between areas within the same year.
   4. However, aerial indices of density were not positively related to
   density between years because the aerial index was lower in 1996 than in
   1995, while in fact the density of ptarmigan increased. This could be
   explained by a reduction in the flushing response of ptarmigan in 1996.
   5. We caution wildlife managers against a possible inter-year variation
   in the number of animals that can be seen from the air when conducting
   aerial surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic pheromone trap captures of Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lep.,

   and with visual observations. Delta-traps with females and Uni-traps
   with synthetic pheromone (1Z,3Z,6Z-9, 10-epoxyheneicosatriene, 3Z,6Z-9,
   10-epoxyheneicosadiene, and 9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienal; total, 2-6
   mg/dispenser) and visual observation at a fixed point were used. The
   diurnal rhythm of activity in the little studied first (spring)
   generation showed a bread peak (3 h) after sunset. The second (summer)
   generation showed a short (1.5 h) but intense peak of attraction before
   sunrise, both to natural and to synthetic pheromones. A second small
   peak, just after sunset, was detected only in traps with the synthetic
   bait. Males started to be attracted to females about 1 h later than to
   synthetics in both generations. The main flight of males (mid-50\% of
   cumulative male catches) was longer (8-11 days) in the first than in the
   second generation (5-7 days). The catches of males were increased by
   high daily maximum temperatures in the spring generation, while rain
   suppressed activity (phenology was delayed) in both generations. The
   total period of activity detectable by visual observations was about 6
   days shorter than by pheromone traps. Population trends were recorded
   over four generations 1992-94 in two sites by trappings of moths and
   counting of larval webs. The second (summer) generation was two to six
   times larger than the spring generation. There was a correlation between
   the log-transformed catch of males and larval webs (r = 0.92 for
   proportions of both infested trees and web density) of the same period.
   This allows prediction of the subsequent larval abundance (offspring)
   based on adult (parent) pheromone trapping in preceding weeks.}},

Abstract = {{A natural colony of Reticulitermes speratus (Kolbe), the foraging
   population and territory of which had been estimated previously by a
   triple mark-recapture program at the Uji campus of Kyoto University, was
   used to determine the effect of bait applications. Bait stations and
   bait tubes containing hexaflumuron were placed in the foraging territory
   in October 1995 to eradicate the colony. The number of monitoring
   stations with foraging termites decreased after May 1996 and no attack
   was observed by July 1996. Because a later inspection in October 1996
   demonstrated no further termite attacks of monitoring stations in the
   foraging territory, the colony that was Composed originally of >300,000
   foraging termites was considered to be eliminated by bait application.
   Approximately 33 mg of hexaflumuron was consumed by the colony. Ten
   months after the end of bait application (May 1997) some termites were
   present at 3 monitoring stations in the foraging territory of the
   eradicated colony. Reinfestation of a few more stations was found after
   lune 1997. Because no marked termite individuals were recaptured from
   any station in the foraging territory of the test colony after
   elimination by baitings, it was impossible to determine whether this
   group of termites belonged to the original colony or came from a
   separate colony. Our results suggest limited applicability of
   mark-release-recapture methodology to determine colony eradication of R.

Abstract = {{Three trap types-probe, cone, and sticky-were used to monitor insect
   populations infesting shelled maize, Zea mays L., housed in galvanized
   steel storage bins. Sticky traps were suspended in the headspace 1 m
   above the grain mass, probe traps were inserted into the grain near the
   top and bottom of the grain mass, and cone traps were positioned at the
   surface of the grain mass. Although there was some overlap, each trap
   type was rather specific in the range of insect species trapped. Probe
   traps positioned near the grain surface trapped mostly Oryzaephilus
   surinamensis (L.), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and Cynaeus angustus
   (LeConte) whereas those positioned near the bottom of the grain mass
   trapped mostly Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky. Cone traps caught mostly
   Typhaea stercorea (L.), Cryptolestes spp., and Ahasverus advena Waltl.
   Sticky traps caught primarily stored-product moths {[}Plodia
   interpunctella (Hubner) and Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier)] and A.
   advena. In addition to catching pest species, done traps also caught
   hemipteran predators and hymenopteran parasitoids, and sticky traps
   caught large numbers of parasitoids. Although probe traps caught smaller
   numbers of several pest species than cone traps, these traps generally
   detected the presence of these species at the same time as cone traps,
   in addition to trapping other species that were not detected at all in
   cone traps. Therefore, a combination of sticky traps in the grain bin
   headspace and probe traps positioned just below the grain surface is
   probably most efficient for monitoring the presence of pest and
   beneficial insect species in grain storage. If pests cannot be
   eliminated from the space beneath the false floor of a grain bin, probe
   traps set at the bottom of the grain mass should provide the best early
   warning of infestation by species colonizing a grain mass by this route.}},

Abstract = {{In July 1997, in response to health studies showing that cumulative
   exposure even to low levels of ozone can have adverse health affects,
   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated a more stringent
   National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone, One-hour
   average ozone concentrations ranging from 0.07 parts per million (ppm)
   to 0.09 ppm were considered as alternative heath-protective standards
   during the regulatory process, To determine the extent to which resident
   and tourist populations on the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland are
   exposed to potentially harmful concentrations of ozone, this study
   examines state and local monitoring site (SLAMS) data from 1985 to 1988,
   the only years in which monitoring was performed on the Lower Eastern
   Shore. The results show that hourly concentrations exceeded 0.07 ppm
   (which the Clean Air Science Advisory Committee has recommended be
   considered a health-significant level) in 1,132 instances, In 479
   instances, concentrations were above 0.08 ppm, and in 193 instances,
   concentrations were above 0.09 ppm. The total number of days on which
   the hourly ozone maximum exceeded 0.07 ppm was 185. On 102 days, the
   maximum was above 0.08 ppm, and on 48 days it was above 0.09 ppm. Ozone
   levels exceeded an eight-hour average concentration of 0.08 ppm a total
   of 52 days during the study period. Nevertheless, under the new
   standard, the Loser Eastern Shore SLAMS would have achieved compliance.
   Comparisons with ozone levels in the Baltimore-Washington corridor show
   that extrapolation from monitoring results in these urban areas map hot
   predict high ozone levels on the Eastern Shore, Consequently local
   monitoring in rural areas is critical to the provision of accurate local
   public health information and the development of forecast models
   specific for the area.}},

Abstract = {{The timing of mortality in the mussel Mytilus edulis and the activities
   of its predators were monitored on the mid and low shore at three
   similar sites in sheltered bays. Experimental clumps containing an
   average of 15 mussels were attached to the rocky shore for 11-57 days
   during three summers. The arrival of predators, deaths due to predators
   and to other causes were recorded on successive visits to each clump.
   Failure time analysis was used to analyze the effects of site,
   intertidal height and years on: (I) the time of the first arrival of the
   predatory snail Nucella lapillus, (2) the time to the commencement of
   drilling, and (3) the time to the first mussel death due to Nucella.
   Attacks by crabs were rare, and no attacks by seastars were recorded.
   Analyses showed striking differences among sites, years, and height. At
   the site most affected by predators, Nucella arrived at clumps in less
   than 4 days, commenced drilling within 4 days, and killed the first
   mussel within eight days in all three years. At the least affected site,
   arrival and attacks by predators were so rare that the estimated median
   time of the first death was greater than 7 weeks. Rates of arrival,
   attacks, and mortality tended to be greater on the mid shore than the
   low shore. Analyses suggest mortality rates are very variable among
   seemingly similar sites and among years. Data on abundance of Nucella
   showed site-to-site variation, but no correlation with mussel mortality.

Title = {{Management of orthopteran pests: a conservation perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{253-261}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although the vast majority of orthopterans are not pests, some species
   have the potential to cause serious damage to human interests.
   Management of pest populations frequently conflicts with conservation of
   orthopteran species and processes, particularly when the pest species or
   its ecological processes are susceptible to extinction or when the pest
   population is coincident with non-target orthopterans. With respect to
   chemical control, the greatest hazards are the broad-spectrum, highly
   lethal properties of most agents, which can be mitigated with
   formulation and application methods. Biological control risks permanent,
   large-scale changes to orthopteran species and processes which can be
   minimized with bioinsecticidal and other short-lived or selective
   formulations and reliable host-range testing. Cultural control may have
   large-scale, broad-spectrum impacts to non-target orthopterans, but
   these hazards can be diminished by appropriate testing and monitoring.
   Mechanical control methods may be impractically labour intensive, but
   they are highly target specific and therefore warrant further
   consideration. Social control measures such as education, insurance and
   compensation programmes appear to have little direct potential for harm
   to orthopteran conservation, but the complex socioeconomic and,
   ultimately, environmental consequences of such programmes have not been
   assessed. The melding of orthopteran pest management and conservation
   requires that we perceive these insects and their ecological processes
   to be vital elements of sustainable agroecosystems. Our management of
   orthopterans (both non-target and pest populations) must focus on
   keeping good stewards on the land.}},

Abstract = {{One of the primary obstacles to understanding why some oyster
   populations are successful and others are not is the complex interaction
   of environmental variables with oyster physiology and with such
   population variables as the rates of recruitment and juvenile mortality.
   A numerical model is useful in investigating how population structure
   originates out of this complexity. We have monitored a suite of
   environmental conditions over an environmental gradient to document the
   importance of short time-scale variations in such variables as food
   supply, turbidity, and salinity. Then, using a coupled oyster disease
   population dynamics model, we examine the need for short rime-scale
   monitoring. We evaluate the usefulness of several measures of food
   supply by comparing field observations and model simulations. Finally,
   we evaluate the ability of a model to reproduce field observations that
   derive from a complex interplay of environmental variables and address
   the problem of the time-history of populations. Our results stress the
   need to evaluate the complex interactions of environmental variables
   with a numerical model and, conversely, the need to evaluate the success
   of modeling against field observations of the results of complex
   processes. Model simulations of oyster populations only approached field
   observations when the environmental variables were measured weekly,
   rather than monthly. Oyster food supply was estimated from measures of
   total particulate organic matter, phytoplankton biomass estimated from
   chlorophyll a, and total labile organic matter estimated from a
   regression between chlorophyll a and total labile carbohydrate, lipid,
   and protein. Only the third measure provided simulations comparable to
   field observations. Model simulations also only approached field
   observations when a multiyear time series was used. The simulations show
   that the most recent year exerts the strongest influence on oyster
   population attributes, but that the longer time-history modulates the
   effect. The results emphasize that year-to-pear changes in environment
   contribute substantially to observed population attributes and that
   multiyear environmental time series are important in describing the
   time-history of relatively long-lived species.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic mechanisms of filarial nematode susceptibility were studied in
   Aedes togoi. Acid hydrolases may play an important role in this process,
   including humoral or cell-mediated defenses. Levels of acid phosphatase,
   alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase
   were determined for 1st- and 4th- instar larvae, male and female pupae,
   and 1- and 7-day-old adults using fluorometric and colorimetric assays.
   Acid phosphatase activity was highest in 1-day-old adults, moderate in
   larvae and pupae, and lowest in 7-day-old adults. Female 7-day-old
   adults had significantly higher levels than males of the same age.
   Moderate levels of cr-glucosidase were found in larvae, with progressive
   increases in activity from pupae to 7-day-old adults. Levels in male
   pupae and 1-day-old males were higher than in females, but activity was
   twice as high in 7-day-old females. Activity of beta-glucuronidase was
   greater in adults, with females showing a 2-fold higher level than males
   at 7 days. In contrast, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity was
   highest in 1st- and 4th-instar larvae and 1-day-old males and females.
   Activity also was significantly higher in male pupae, slightly greater
   in 1-day-old males, but twice as high in 7-day-old females when compared
   to males of the same age. Results showed significant changes and
   variation in acid hydrolase enzyme titers in the different Life stages
   of Ae. togoi. These and other specific acid hydrolases could prove
   effective in monitoring biochemical and genetic changes in mosquito
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Age structures of populations of canopy trees in Wormley Wood are
   consistent with reports that successional change is occurring, with
   Carpinus betulus replacing Quercus petraea as the dominant species.
   TWINSPAN analysis of data from a vegetation survey identifies three
   communities (described in earlier work), the `Bracken', `Bramble', and
   `Bareground' societies, characterized by increasing prominence of C.
   betulus and loss of species diversity.
   An experiment was set up in which C. betulus, Q. petraea and Betula
   pendula seedlings were explanted into each of the communities. Survival
   of seedlings was monitored over 860 days and differences investigated.
   Cohort survivorship differed between species and sites. C. betulus
   seedlings survived longer than Q. petraea in Bracken and Bramble
   communities.
   Species- and site-specific variation in the types and effects of
   herbivory were found. Herbivory did not appear to be a critical factor
   in the survival of Q. petraea seedlings. The photosynthetic light
   response of the seedling species was measured in the field. The light
   compensation point for Q. petraea seedlings (77 mu mol photon m(-2)
   s(-1)) is higher than the maximum available light under the main tree
   canopies in the wood. In contrast, seedlings of C. betulus have a lower
   light compensation point (15 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) and the mature
   tree casts a deeper shade than Q. petraea. It is suggested that the
   invasion of the canopy by C. betulus, following the cessation of
   coppicing, is creating light levels too low for Q. petraea seedling
   banks to persist.}},

Abstract = {{High-frequency sampling of surface picoplanktonic populations was
   performed in Villefranche Bay (north-western Mediterranean Sea) during
   the first week of July 1996. The evolution of abundance and cell
   parameters were monitored once per hour by flow cytometry for these
   populations: Synechococcus cyanobacteria, photosynthetic picoeukaryotes,
   and heterotrophic bacteria plus Prochlorococcus. Some parameters, such
   as the right-angle light scatter of Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, or
   the red chlorophyll fluorescence of picoeukaryotes, exhibited a very
   clear 24-h diel periodicity. For other parameters, such as Synechococcus
   red chlorophyll fluorescence, it was necessary to perform a Fourier
   analysis to establish a major 24-h period unambiguously. This analysis
   also revealed that some other parameters, however, such as the cell
   concentration, right-angle light scatter, and red chlorophyll
   fluorescence of picoeukaryotes, or the red chlorophyll and orange
   phycoerythrin fluorescence of Synechococcus, had a period of 17-18 h,
   corresponding to the inertial frequency at this latitude. The cell cycle
   of Synechococcus, sampled twice per hour, was synchronized with the
   daily light cycle, allowing an estimate of their growth rate, which
   averaged 0.95 d(-1) (SD = 0.26, n = 7). Its large day-to-day variability
   was related to the duration of the interval between the maxima of S and
   G2 phases that ranged from 2 to 3.5 hours. Generally, the division rate
   was depressed on sunny days. The loss rate of Synechococcus was in
   general lower than the division rate and appeared to follow the
   evolution of the latter with a 1-d lag, as if grazers or viruses adapted
   very rapidly to changes in division rates. Over the period of study,
   concentrations of Synechococcus and other bacteria were significantly
   correlated (r(2) = 0.60, p < 0.01, n = 340), suggesting the possibility
   of a common controlling factor for these populations, e.g., phosphorus
   or grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial and nuclear genes have different inheritance, thus studies
   of fungal populations should use both mitochondrial and nuclear markers.
   Using nuclear markers, the S238N strain of the ectomycorrhizal
   basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor ((Maire) Orton) has been previously shown
   to persist for at least 10 yr after outplanting in a plantation of
   Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mir.) France) inoculated with this
   strain. In the present study, we have sampled j39 sporophores of
   Laccaria spp. from this plantation, some of which had the S238N nuclear
   genotype, to study mitochondrial DNA polymorphism and persistence of the
   inoculated S238N mitochondrial genome. Length polymorphism in fragments
   of the large subunit of mitochondrial ribosomal DNA (LrDNA) allowed
   distinction of the haplotypes present in the plantation at the species
   level. In addition, heteroduplex analysis and sequencing revealed
   intraspecific polymorphism of LrDNA among the L. bicolor sporophores and
   enabled specific identification of S238N LrDNA. This haplotype was only
   retained in sporophores carrying the S238N nuclear genome, confirming
   the survival of this introduced strain in a natural population.}},

Title = {{Pesticide resistance: Assessment of risk and the development and

Journal = {{PESTICIDE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{435-446}},

Abstract = {{Insecticides, fungicides and herbicides are critical to successful crop
   production, but the development of pesticide resistance is a continual
   threat, especially to many of today's selective toxophores with specific
   binding sites. In order to manage resistance effectively, an assessment
   of genetic, ecological and operational risk factors is required, which
   must then be translated into meaningful local strategies that can be
   implemented through appropriate labelling of products and education of
   end users. Assessing resistance risk is a fundamental part of the
   development process for new molecules and is increasingly becoming a
   requirement of registration alongside toxicological and environmental
   risk data. Laboratory studies, including elucidation of target sites and
   metabolic degradation pathways, mutagenesis, computer models and
   cross-resistance tests, and field studies, including establishment of
   baseline sensitivities and evaluation of anti-resistance strategies, all
   play a part in such assessment. The challenge is then to devise
   management strategies which are relevant to local practice and actually
   reduce selection pressure to a point where product life is preserved. A
   preventative strategy should be in place at time of launch and for most
   pesticides, regional co-operation between all interested parties, of the
   kind advocated by the Resistance Action Committees of GCPF (Global Crop
   Protection Federation), increases the chance of success. Implementation
   of strategies via a universal product labelling system, already
   practised in some herbicide markets, is seen as a key way to improve
   product usage patterns. Monitoring resistance levels in field
   populations after product launch enables any fine tuning of tactics over
   time, for example in response to new technologies such as transgenic
   varieties being introduced. The limited successes in resistance
   management in Australia, Zimbabwe, Europe and USA are not so easily
   achieved in small-holder farming in developing countries, as exemplified
   by continuing problems in parts of India and China. Emphasis must be
   given to the education of growers and dealers in IRM and IPM, and
   improved extension services, in order to bring about a more sustainable
   approach to crop protection. (C) 1998 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

   cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni {[}Lepidoptera : Noctuidae], were
   monitored over two years in broccoli plantings (Brassica oleracea var.
   italica) in southeastern New Brunswick. Four population peaks of
   imported cabbageworm were seen in 1990 and 1991 with 92 and 99\% of the
   total larval population, respectively, being recorded during the latter
   part of the season, after 23 July. Four population peaks were also
   recorded for the diamondback moth in 1990 and 1991 with 81 and 97\%,
   respectively, of the population being recorded after 23 July.
   Populations of cabbage looper appeared later in the season and because
   of low numbers were more difficult to assess. Using cabbage looper
   equivalents (CLE), the effectiveness of planting date as a pest
   management tool was also studied. Early crops have lower mean CLE per
   plant per week, and would require less insecticide applications than
   later crops.}},

Abstract = {{Isolates of Puccinia triticina were obtained from wheat leaf collections
   made by cooperators throughout the United States and from cereal rust
   field surveys of the Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and Gulf Coast states in
   1993, 1994, and 1995. Sixty-two virulence/avirulence phenotypes on 14
   host lines that are near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance were found
   among 681 single uredinial isolates in 1993, 42 phenotypes were found
   among 683 isolates in 1994, and 51 among 701 isolates in 1995. As in
   previous surveys, regional race distribution patterns showed that the
   central United States is a single epidemiological unit distinct from the
   eastern United States. The distinctive racial composition of collections
   from the Southeast, Northeast, and Ohio Valley indicates that
   populations of P. triticina in those areas are discrete, suggesting
   epidemics originate from localized overwintering sources.}},

   studies from Ontario, Canada, offers encouraging evidence that lake
   trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations can be restored to acidified
   lakes once the problem of acid deposition is solved in North America.
   Predicting the rate of chemical and biological recovery remains
   difficult, because there are several limnological attributes (dissolved
   organic carbon, flushing rate) and biological attributes (acid
   sensitivity, species longevity, fish community composition) of lake
   trout ecosystems that can either enhance or delay the recovery process.
   Some options for managing recovering lakes are also reviewed, including
   increased pollution controls, liming, hatchery stocking, and harvest
   controls.}},

Abstract = {{Viable Escherichia coli cells were entrapped in agar gel layers to form
   artificial biofilms. Sessile-like bacteria and planktonic (suspended)
   counterparts were exposed for 28 d to natural (spring)-water at two
   temperatures (4 degrees C and 18 degrees C). Culturabilities on
   non-selective and selective solid media were monitored over the exposure
   period, together with cell viability that was determined by using a
   fluorescent viability probe and confocal scanning laser microscopy
   analysis. The number of planktonic organisms recovered on non-selective
   medium decreased by 3 logarithmic units during exposure at 4 degrees C
   and was reduced to an undetectable level at 18 degrees C. Whatever the
   temperature of the spring water microcosm, however, the immobilized-cell
   population did not decrease by more than one log unit over the exposure
   period. Cell counts on coliform-selective, lactose-deoxycholate agar
   plates confirmed the enhanced resistance of gel-entrapped cells to
   environment stress as compared to planktonic organisms: at the two
   tested temperatures, sublethal injury of suspended E. coli reached more
   than 80\% whereas it did not exceed 65\% for immobilized cells.
   Viability studies indicated that planktonic cells rapidly died. These
   results show that the ability of microorganisms to colonize aquatic
   ecosystems in the fixed state (i.e. as biofilms) must be considered in
   studies evaluating cell survival in these environments. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Sludge was taken from laboratory-scale simulators of landfill bioreactor
   (LFBR) treating the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW)
   over a period of 1 year. Population densities of acetogens, hydrogen-
   and acetate-utilizing methanogens and the specific methanogenic activity
   (SMA) on degrading butyrate, propionate, acetate and formate were
   measured. The results indicate that the Gompertz equation is a suitable
   model for describing the growth data of acetogens, hydrogen- and
   acetate-utilizing methanogens. The development of SMAs can be
   systematically described by a simple mathematical equation derived from
   the Gompertz equation. The measurements of bacterial population growth
   and methanogenic activity reveal that the SMA of acetate is an ultimate
   indicator for monitoring the OFMSW decomposition. Leachate recycling can
   stimulate the carbon flow from hydrolysis/fermentation through the
   hydrogen/acetate toward methane. A moisture content of 75\% is suggested
   to be an initial rapid decomposition threshold for the anaerobic organic
   refuse mineralization in a landfill bioreactor. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An 1991 investigation of PCB concentrations in water and fish along a
   river was repeated in 1996 after the completion of a remediation of
   PCB-containing sediment in a lake within the river system. The PCB
   concentrations in the lake water decreased significantly (from 8.6 to
   2.7 ng/L), and the concentrations in fish was halved (significantly
   lower) after remediation. PCB still remaining in littoral sediment was
   probably the cause for a recorded gradient of PCB concentrations in fish
   from the lake and downstream. The PCB concentrations in water and fish
   was lower in 1996 compared to 1991 in all locations studied. The
   decreased levels of PCB in fish between the years for the two upstream
   locations, probably results from a decline in background PCB exposure.
   Monitoring data from 30 years back, recorded in a south Swedish lake,
   has shown a 6\% decline per year in the PCB concentration in pike (Esox
   lucius) (Bignert, A.; Olsson, M.; Persson, W.; Jensen, S.; Zakrisson,
   S.; Litzen, K.; Eriksson, U.; Haggberg, L.; Alsberg, T. Environ. Pollut.
   1998, 94, 177-198). The data on PCB concentration in fish (perch, in the
   present study) from the two upstream locations were recalculated on the
   basis of this yearly decline and resulted in concentrations close to
   those measured in 1996. The results indicated, that changes in
   background exposure must be taken into account when evaluating the
   success of remedial actions measures carried out over several years.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of disturbance to coral on the abundances of fishes were
   investigated experimentally on the Great Barrier Reef. Fishes on ten
   large (108-267 m(2)) isolated patch reefs or `bommies' were monitored at
   1-2 month intervals for a year. The hard corals on five of these were
   disturbed by breaking the colonies into small pieces with a mallet.
   Fishes were counted for the next year. Cover of coral on the damaged
   bommies decreased from approximate to 66\% to approximate to 29\% by the
   end of the study, but increased by 5\% at the control bommies. Linear
   mixed-effects models were used to examine the numbers of 53 species of
   fishes (from a total pool of 150 species). Significant declines in
   abundance were detected in five species, all of which associate closely
   with live coral: an apogonid (Cheilodipterus artus), a chaetodontid
   (Chaetodon rainfordi) and three pomacentrids (the species complex
   Chromis atripectoralis-viridis, Dascyllus reticulatus, and Pomacentrus
   moluccensis). One herbivorous pomacentrid (Pomacentrus grammorhynchus)
   significantly increased in abundance. Each of the affected species
   showed a different temporal response to file disturbance, ranging from
   emigration and local extinction within one month, to changes in
   recruitment six months later. This study shows that many species of
   fishes are robust to physical disturbances which substantially reduce
   cover of coral and modify the fine-scale (1 m) heterogeneity provided by
   the veneer of live corals on the surface of a reef. The few negatively
   affected species frequently sheltered in live coral; the one positively
   affected species was herbivorous. Many coral-associated species and many
   herbivores were not affected, so it is not yet possible to make precise
   predictions about which species will be affected by disturbance to
   coral. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term systematic approach to planning the reintroduction of
   Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica) and Arabian oryx (Oryx
   leucoryx) in Israel is presented. The reintroductions rely on local
   breeding-cores that are at their holding capacity of 150 deer and 80
   oryx. The approach is based on three elements: (1) maximizing the number
   of animals that can be withdrawn from a permanent breeding core for the
   purpose of reintroduction using `maximum sustained yield' (MSY)
   techniques; (2) determining a priori, using rules-of-thumb (such as IUCN
   Red List Categories), preliminary criteria for project completion; and
   (3) estimating the time it would take the reintroduced populations to
   meet the criteria for project completion. I used Monte Carlo Leslie
   matrix growth models to determine MSY and to project the growth of the
   reintroduced population. Based on these simulations, the MSY for the
   fallow deer breeding-core is 15 adult females in the first year and 12
   adult females/year thereafter. The oryx breeding-core can yield 12 adult
   females during the first year and 16 adult females every third year
   thereafter. Project completion was preliminarily set to a wild
   population of 250 adult deer and 100 adult oryx. The simulations predict
   that it will take 8-11 years to complete the fallow deer reintroduction
   and 6-10 years to complete the oryx reintroduction. Post-release
   monitoring will help improve the data used in the model and permit
   re-assessment of the criteria for project completion.}},

Abstract = {{Colonies of the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Sta1),
   virulent against two resistant rice cultivars carrying BPH resistance
   genes, either bph8 or Bph9, were selected under laboratory conditions.
   Two BPH resistant indica cultivars, Thai Col. 11 (a bph8 carrier) and
   Pokkali (a Bph9 carrier), were used as selection hosts on which the
   wild-type population of RPH was continuously cultured. The virulence or
   adaptation was monitored on the resistant hosts during the selection
   process based on the following five parameters; survival rate, wing
   dimorphism, oviposition, egg hatch and egg hatchability. Selection
   appeared to be achieved at the 9th-15th generations depending on the
   parameters and the selection hosts. The colony selected on Thai Col. 11
   showed a high level of virulence not only against the selection host but
   also against another bph8 carrier, cv. Thai Col. 5. The colony selected
   on Pokkali also showed virulence on the selection host but this
   virulence was unstable and not effective against another Bph9 carrier,
   cv. Balamawee. Our results suggested the presence of virulent BPH
   individuals (forerunners) in the wild population that could effectively
   be selected on resistant rice hosts with specific major resistance
   genes. The genetic system of BPH virulence and rice resistance is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of density of juvenile sea scallops (Placopecten
   magellanicus; 0-45 scallops m(-2)) on behavioural responses of predatory
   crabs (Cancer irroratus) and sea stars (Asterias vulgaris and A.
   forbesi) was examined in an experiment using tethered scallops in
   Lunenburg Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. Within experimental plots (4 m(2)),
   mortality of tethered scallops, density of shell remains of unattached
   scallops, and density of predators were monitored to determine the
   functional and aggregative responses of crabs and sea stars. The cause
   of mortality (crab or sea star predation) could be identified from the
   scallop shell remains. Predation rate on scallops increased
   significantly with scallop density, but predator density did not. Thus,
   predators displayed a functional response, and not an aggregative
   response. Proportional mortality of scallops indicated that crab
   predation tended to be positively density-dependent, whereas sea star
   predation was density-independent. The results of this study are
   relevant to bottom culture operations and indicate that crabs would have
   a greater impact than sea stars on seeded populations of scallops. (C)

Abstract = {{An allozyme survey was conducted in three naturalized populations of
   rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), from rivers in two Andean
   lakes of southern Chile. The analysis was based on 32 presumed loci, 10
   of which were variable, and revealed that the mean percentage of
   polymorphic loci (P = 21.8\%: range = 15.6-28.1\%), the mean number of
   alleles per locus (n = 1.26; range = 1.2-1.3) and the mean observed
   heterozygosity (H-O = 7.0\%; range = 6.0-8.2\%) are high, although
   within the range reported for rainbow trout. Although the mean genetic
   distance between the samples was low (D = 0.003), and only 5.2\% of the
   total observed genetic variation can be accounted by interpopulation
   differences (F-ST = 0.052), eight out of 10 polymorphic loci exhibited
   significant allelic heterogeneity, Some loci, notably EST-1{*},
   IDHP-3,4{*}, MEP-1{*} and PGM-1{*}, showed considerable discriminatory
   capacity among the samples. Rainbow trout has a longer history in
   Chilean waters since salmonid introduction started earlier this century.
   Under current intensive farming practices, the preliminary information
   provided in the present paper is likely to be helpful in setting up a
   baseline for further characterization and/or monitoring of naturalized
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The stenoglossan prosobranch Hinia incrassata, collected along the coast
   of Brittany and Normandy between 1988 and 1997. exhibits imposer also
   known as pseudohermaphroditism (the occurrence of male parts in addition
   to the female genital system) in response to tributyltin (TBT)
   pollution. Excluding some normal females (stage 0), different imposer
   stages as defined by Fioroni et al. (1991a) (1a, 1b, 2a, 3a and 4) can
   be distinguished and have been documented for the first time using
   scanning electron micrographs. Additional malformations of the genital
   tract are described. Neither TBT-induced sterilization nor sex change
   occur in the analyzed samples. TBT accumulation in soft parts was
   analyzed and bioconcentration factors (BCF) were found to be between
   4.68 . 10(4) and 1.22 . 10(5). The VDS (vas deferens sequence) index,
   RPL (relative penis length) index and the average female penis length
   (FPL) in populations exhibit a significant dependence on both TBT
   concentrations in ambient sea water and TBT body burden. An
   interspecific comparison between imposer intensities in sympatrically
   living populations of Hinia incrassata, Nucella lapillus and Hinia
   reticulata reveals that H. incrassata exhibits the lowest TBT
   sensitivity of the three species. But even in this relatively
   unsensitive species the threshold concentration for imposer development
   is below 1.5 ng TBT as Sn l(-1). The VDS index is recommended as the
   most suited biological parameter for effect monitoring purposes because
   this index is characterized by the lowest deviation of data points from
   calculated concentration-effect-equations and shows no seasonal
   variations. Hinia incrassata is proposed for large large-scale TBT
   surveys in the Mediterranean being planned by OSPARCOM for the North
   Atlantic. Furthermore the species can be used for TBT temporal trend
   monitoring. Studies in France, for example, where TBT was partially
   banned in 1982, show little or no recovery from TBT contamination in H.
   incrassata and two other prosobranch species between 1989 and 1997. (C)

Abstract = {{To monitor the exposure of Canadian populations, Health Canada has
   carried out six major surveys of breast milli contaminants, beginning in
   1967. In these national surveys, breast milli was collected from nursing
   mothers at various times in their nursing period, and the concentrations
   of chlorinated hydrocarbons were measured. There was a downward trend
   from 1967 to 1992, in the concentrations of organochlorine (OC)
   pesticides and polychorinated biphenyl hydrocarbons (PCBs). This
   regression was observed for samples across Canada, except for a sharp
   isolated increase in 1982 for the Quebec Province. As the disappearance
   curves of the chemicals surveyed follow the same pattern for both
   Ontario and Canada, a similar decline could be expected of OC
   concentrations in human breast milk in the Great Lakes Basin.}},

Abstract = {{During the winters of 1992/1993, 1993/1994 and 1994/1995 a monitoring
   study was performed in three urban and three non-urban areas in the
   Netherlands. PM10, black smoke (BS), sulfate, nitrate, ammonium
   (non-organic secondary aerosols, ``NOSA{''}) and aerosol acidity were
   measured on a daily basis in both the urban and non-urban areas. During
   the third winter, PM2.5 was measured as well. The elemental composition
   of PM10 was analyzed for one-third of the filters collected during the
   winter of 1993/1994 with inductively coupled plasma (ICP). PM10 and BS
   concentrations were on average 13\% and 19\% higher in the urban areas
   than in the non-urban areas. NOSA concentrations were on average 8\%
   lower in the urban areas. PM2.5 concentrations were similar in the urban
   and non-urban area. Higher elemental concentrations in PM10 were found
   in the urban area for all elements except Si. The contrast between
   elemental concentrations in PM10 was for most elements larger than for
   PM10 mass concentration. The small contrast in particle concentrations
   between urban and non-urban areas in the Netherlands is probably a
   result of the small size of the country, the high population density,
   the lack of small-scale geographical and meteorological differences, and
   the importance of long-range transport of air pollutants. Both the
   absolute concentrations of PM10, BS and NOSA and the urban-non-urban
   differences depended strongly on wind direction. Easterly winds
   resulting in an influx of air masses from Central and Eastern Europe
   were associated with high concentrations and minimal urban-non-urban
   differences. Winds from the sea resulted in low concentrations but
   larger relative differences between urban and non-urban areas. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This note presents vertical concentration profiles of various size
   fractions of suspended particulate matter, measured over the first three
   metres from ground in a street canyon, using a novel sampling system.
   The daily average percentage difference of airborne particulate matter
   concentration between receptor heights 0.81 and 2.88 m, with the lower
   height taken as reference, was more than 35\% for PM10 and more than
   12\% for the inhalable fraction, for 5 out of the 7 days of measurement.
   These preliminary measurements, carried out during June-August 1997,
   consisting of 37 h of data, corroborate the idea put forward by Cells
   and Micallef (Atmospheric Environment 31, 4253-4254), that different
   height groups of the population are exposed to different concentrations.
   Air-quality standards, based on human exposure estimates, should take
   this variation into account. These measurements also have implications
   for the siting of urban air quality monitoring systems. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the findings of a large number of people engaged
   in the study of the Merlin Falco columbarius population in the south
   Pennines. Between 1980 and 1992 the number of nesting areas found to be
   occupied by Merlin increased from two to 66, and the proportion of
   checked sites found to be occupied rose from 29 to 78\%. The apparent
   increase in the size of the population was not solely a result of
   increased observer activity. The fao occupied nests found in 1980 and
   1981 were in trees in grassland areas, but thereafter nearly all were on
   the ground amongst heather. Compared to the study area as a whole, grass
   moor was less frequent and heather moor more frequent within a 1.5 km
   radius of the nesting area. Nearest-neighbour distance varied from 5.7
   km in 1985 to 2.1 km in 1992, remaining relatively stable in comparison
   to the increasing size of the population. Nesting areas were aggregated
   in comparison to a distribution of random points. The density of nesting
   areas was greatest between 0.25 and 1.5 km from the moorland edge. This
   paper demonstrates that collaboration between conservation professionals
   and dedicated volunteers can succeed in monitoring population change.}},

Abstract = {{Broad-scale avian surveys have been attempted within North America with
   mixed results. Arid regions, such as the Great Basin, are often poorly
   sampled because of the vastness of the region, inaccessibility of sites,
   and few ornithologists. In addition, extreme variability in wetland
   habitat conditions present special problems for conducting censuses of
   species inhabiting these areas. We examined these issues in assessing
   multi-scale shorebird (order: Charadriiformes) censuses conducted in the
   western Great Basin from 1992-1997. On ground surveys, we recorded 31
   species of shorebirds, but were unable to accurately estimate population
   size. Conversely, on aerial surveys we were able to estimate regional
   abundance of some shorebirds, but were unable to determine species
   diversity. Aerial surveys of three large alkali lakes in Oregon (Goose,
   Summer, and Abert Lakes) revealed > 300,000 shorebirds in one year of
   this study, of which 67\% were American Avocets (Recurvirostra
   americana) and 30\% phalaropes (Phalaropus spp.). These lakes clearly
   meet Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network guidelines for
   designation as important shorebird sites. Based upon simulations of our
   monitoring effort and the magnitude and variation of numbers of American
   Avocets, detection of 5-10\% negative declines in populations of these
   birds would take a minimum of 7-23 years of comparable effort. We
   conclude that a combination of ground and aerial surveys must be
   conducted at multiple sites and years and over a large region to obtain
   an accurate picture of the diversity, abundance, and trends of
   shorebirds in the western Great Basin.}},

Abstract = {{1. The birch (Betula)-feeding aphid, Monaphis antennata, is always found
   at low densities on individual hosts and has low local abundance, but
   another birch-feeding aphid, Euceraphis betulae, is often found at high
   densities on individual hosts and has high local abundance.
   2. This work attempts to establish whether the interaction between M.
   antennata and its host or the behaviour of individuals limits its
   densities.
   3. Both species were reared on saplings, and population sizes were
   monitored for 6 weeks. Two levels of host quality were used and feeding
   space was kept constant throughout the experiment. Adults were prevented
   from leaving the saplings by clipping their wings, and predators were
   excluded.
   4. On plants of similar host quality, both species achieved similar
   population sizes.
   5. It is concluded that resource availability or the interactions
   between individuals are unlikely to be important causes of rarity.}},

Title = {{Assessing the risk of extinction for the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in
   the Cordillera Cantabrica, Spain}},

Abstract = {{The status of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) in Spain has suffered a
   dramatic decline during the last centuries, both in area and numbers.
   Current relict populations are suspected to be under immediate risk of
   extinction. The aim of our model is to attain an understanding of the
   main processes and mechanisms determining population dynamics in the
   Cordillera Cantabrica. We compile the knowledge available about brown
   bears in the Cordillera Cantabrica, northern Spain, and perform a
   population viability analysis (PVA) to diagnose the current state of the
   population and to support current management.
   The specially constructed simulation model, based on long-term field
   investigations on the western brown bear population in the Cordillera
   Cantabrica, includes detailed life history data and information on
   environmental variations in food abundance. The method of
   individual-based modeling is employed to simulate the fate of individual
   bears, Reproduction, family breakup, and mortalities are modeled in
   annual time steps under the influence of environmental variations in
   food abundance, mortality rates, and reproductive parameters. In
   parallel, we develop an analytical model that describes the mean
   behavior of the population and that enables us to perform a detailed
   sensitivity analysis.
   We determine current population parameters by iterating the model with
   plausible values and compare simulation results with the 1982-1995 time
   pattern of observed number of females with cubs of the year. Our results
   indicate that the population suffered a mean annual decrease of similar
   to 4-5\% during the study period, 1982-1995. This decrease could be
   explained by a coincidence of high poaching pressure with a series of
   climatically unfavorable years during the period 1982-1988. Thereafter,
   population size probably stabilized. We estimate that the population
   currently consists of 25 or 26 independent females and a total of 50-60
   individuals. However, our viability analysis shows that the population
   does not satisfy the criterion of a minimum viable population if
   mortalities remain at the level of the last few years of 1988-1995. The
   ``salvation{''} of at least one independent female every three years is
   required.
   The population retains relatively high reproductive parameters,
   indicating good nutritive conditions of the habitat, but mortality rates
   are higher than those known in other brown bear populations. The most
   sensitive parameters, adult and subadult mortality of females, form the
   principal management target. Our model shows that the series of females
   with cubs contains valuable information on the state of the population.
   We recommend monitoring of females with cubs as the most important
   management action, both for collecting data and for safeguarding the
   most sensitive part of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas habitat conservation plans (HCPs) have been intended to provide
   comprehensive environmental mitigation for multiple species, they often
   narrow in focus to one species and either one mitigation site or
   unspecified sites. We developed an indicators framework from which to
   rate land units for their ecological integrity, collateral values
   (nonbiological qualities that can improve conservation), and restoration
   and conservation opportunities. The ratings of land units were guided by
   the tenets of conservation biology and principles of landscape and
   ecosystem ecology, and they were made using existing physical and floral
   information managed on a GIS. As an example of how the indicators
   approach can be used for HCPs, the 29 legally rare species targeted by
   the Yolo County HCP were each associated with vegetation complexes and
   agricultural crops, the maps of which were used for rating some of the
   landscape indices. The ratings were mapped so that mitigation can be
   directed to the places on the landscape where the legally rare species
   should benefit most from conservation practices. The most highly rated
   land units for conservation opportunity occurred along streams and
   sloughs, especially where they emerged from the foothills and entered
   the Central Valley and where the two largest creeks intersected the
   Sacramento River flood basin. We recommend that priority be given to
   mitigation or conservation at the most highly rated land units. The
   indices were easy to measure and can be used with other tools to monitor
   the mitigation success. The indicators framework can be applied to other
   large-area planning efforts with some modifications.}},

Abstract = {{Larger fish species may not always be suitable for monitoring the
   response to industrial effluents because they are mobile and capable of
   extensive movement beyond effluent exposure areas. Spoonhead sculpin
   (Cottus ricei) was collected upstream and downstream of a large
   bleached-kraft pulp mill on the Athabasca River, Alberta, Canada, during
   fall and spring periods to determine whether small, sedentary fish
   species demonstrate responses reflecting local exposure conditions.
   During the fall sampling period, exposed fish were older and larger than
   upstream fish and showed increases in condition, gonad size, egg weight,
   liver weight, and hepatic mixed function oxygenase activity
   (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase {[}EROD]). Sculpin collected from the
   opposite river bank, where exposure was reduced, showed condition
   factors, gonad size, egg weight, liver weight, and EROD activity that
   were not significantly different from reference sites or intermediate
   between reference and downstream values. In the spring after a prolonged
   overwinter exposure to higher effluent concentrations, exposed fish were
   larger, showed increased size-at-age, condition, liver weight, ovary
   size, and EROD activity. Far-field collections showed that most
   responses persisted downstream for at least 48 km. The general response
   of exposed spoonhead sculpin was consistent with a nutrient enrichment
   effect described in studies investigating water quality, algal growth,
   and benthos communities at this site but also may be related to reduced
   competition associated with the loss of older fish observed in the
   spring. The use of small species for sentinel monitoring provided a
   viable alternative to use of larger, more mobile species.}},

Abstract = {{To further evaluate the suitability of small fish species for sentinel
   monitoring, a comparison was made between the responses of trout-perch
   (Percopsis omiscomaycus) and the larger white sucker (Catostomus
   commersoni) under similar conditions of pulp mill effluent exposure and
   mobility. Fish were collected upstream and downstream of a
   thermomechanical pulp mill on the Kapuskasing River, Ontario, Canada,
   where the presence of a hydro dam restricts the movement of fish between
   reference and exposure areas. Trout-perch collected downstream of the
   mill were shorter, lighter, and younger than upstream fish, whereas
   exposed white sucker were longer, heavier, and, for male sucker, older
   than reference fish. Only male trout-perch showed induced hepatic mixed
   function oxygenase activity (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase). Both
   forskolin-stimulated in vitro production of 17 beta-estradiol in
   trout-perch and plasma concentrations of 17 P-estradiol in sucker were
   significantly depressed in exposed fish. The inconsistency in responses
   between species made it difficult to determine how the opposing
   responses were related and which species was most sensitive to instream
   conditions. Despite the discrepancies, use of an interpretation
   framework indicated that both species identified similar potential
   problems (e.g., size-selective mortality and recruitment problems),
   suggesting that either species could be used as a sentinel species at

Abstract = {{The abundance and biomass of the large heterotrophic dinoflagellate
   Noctiluca scintillans, together with the changes in its potential prey
   items, were monitored in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, during summer 1997
   (17 July-11 August). Growth and grazing rates of N.scintillans fed
   natural plankton populations were also measured eight and seven times,
   respectively, during the survey period. The abundance and biomass of
   N.scintillans averaged over the water column (19 m) were in the range
   1-345 cells l(-1) (temporal average = 93 cells l(-1)) and 0.1-49.6 mu g
   C l(-1) (temporal average = 13.8 mu g C l(-1); three times higher than
   that of calanoid copepods during the same period). Noctiluca scintillans
   populations followed the changes in phytoplankton: N.scintillans biomass
   was increasing during the period of diatom blooms and was at a plateau
   or decreasing during periods of low chlorophyll a. The growth rates of
   N.scintillans (mu) were also consistent with the wax and wane of the
   N.scintillans population: N.scintillans showed highest growth rates
   during diatom blooms. A simple relationship between mu and chlorophyll a
   concentration was established, and the production of N.scintillans was
   estimated using this relationship and the measured biomass. The
   estimated production averaged over the water column was in the range
   <0.1-5.2 mu g C l(-1) day(-1) (temporal average = 1.4 mu g C l(-1)
   day(-1); 64\% of the production of calanoid copepods during the same
   period). Diatom clearance rates by N.scintillans were in the range
   0.10-0.35 ml cell(-1) day(-1), and the phytoplankton population
   clearance by N.scintillans was <12\% day(-1). Thus, although the feeding
   pressure of N.scintillans on phytoplankton standing stock was low,
   N.scintillans was an important member of the mesozooplankton in terms of
   biomass and production in the Seto Inland Sea during summer.}},

Abstract = {{Spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam,) is a non-indigenous weed
   infesting large areas of rangeland in western North America. Life
   history models have been used to identify key processes regulating weed
   population dynamics and may be valuable in developing and testing
   integrated weed management strategies. Our objective was to characterize
   the life history of spotted knapweed, Demographic attributes were
   monitored monthly during snow free periods beginning August 1994 through
   October 1996 on 2 sites. Data were arranged into life history tables,
   and sensitivity analysis was performed to determine key transition
   phases affecting seed output. Spotted knapweed seed production ranged
   from 998 to 7815 viable seeds/m(2) at both sites during the study. Seeds
   reaching the soil averaged 41 and 50\% of seed output at sites 1 and 2,
   respectively. Less than 6\% of seeds reaching the soil germinated in the
   fall at both sites. Recruitment peaked in April at 36\% and in June at
   20\% of seeds reaching the soil on sites 1 and 2, respectively. Spotted
   knapweed juvenile density peaked August 1995 and June 1996 at both
   sites. Peaks corresponded with the beginning of the summer dry period.
   Plants bolted beginning June 1995 and May 1996, Sensitivity analysis
   identified early-summer juvenile survivorship, late-summer adult
   survivorship, transition from juvenile to adult, and seeds produced per
   adult as critical stages for spotted knapweed seed output. Management
   strategies that reduce spotted knapweed populations at these stages are
   likely to have the greatest impact on spotted knapweed population growth
   and spread. A weed population dynamics model using the life history
   demographic data was developed and can be used to design and test
   integrated spotted knapweed strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Passive acoustic monitoring of common dolphins was conducted across a
   survey area of 1000 n.m.(2) (nautical miles) off the west Wales coast
   during the months September, October, November and December 1995.
   Dolphin presence and distribution was assessed by a system of percentage
   acoustic contact. Results were compared with those from a
   seismic/dolphin survey during the same months of the previous year, and
   across the same survey area. Distributions of common dolphins within the
   survey area showed similar trends for both years, with a marked decrease
   in dolphin contacts between September and October of both years. These
   observations suggest offshore migration of common dolphin populations at
   the time of year. Sea surface temperature distribution across the entire
   region was visualized during two survey periods using infrared satellite
   imagery. It is hypothesized from these observations that offshore
   migration of common dolphins coincides with a break-up of the Celtic Sea
   Front, a distinct oceanographic feature which crosses the survey area.}},

Abstract = {{In many estuaries, maxima in turbidity and abundance of several common
   species of zooplankton occur in the low salinity zone (LSZ) in the range
   of 0.5-6 practical salinity units (psu). Analysis of zooplankton
   abundance from monitoring in 1972-1987 revealed that historical maxima
   in abundance of the copepod Eurytemora affinis and the mysid Neomysis
   mercedis, and in turbidity as determined from Secchi disk data, were
   close to the estimated position of 2 psu bottom salinity. The copepod
   Sinocalanus doerrii had a maximum slightly landward of that of E.
   affinis. After 1987 these maxima decreased and shifted to a lower
   salinity, presumably because of the effects of grazing by the introduced
   clam Potamocorbula amurensis. At the same time, the copepod
   Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, the mysid Acanthomysis sp., and amphipods
   became abundant with peaks at salinity around 0.2-0.5 psu.
   Plausible mechanisms for maintenance of these persistent abundance peaks
   include interactions between variation in flow and abundance, either in
   the vertical or horizontal plane, or higher net population growth rate
   in the peaks than seaward of the peaks. In spring of 1994, a dry year,
   we sampled in and near the LSZ using a Lagrangian sampling scheme to
   follow selected isohalines while sampling over several complete tidal
   cycles. Acoustic Doppler current profilers were used to provide detailed
   velocity distributions to enable us to estimate longitudinal duxes of
   organisms. Stratification was weak and gravitational circulation nearly
   absent in the LSZ. All of the common species of zooplankton migrated
   vertically in response to the tides, with abundance higher in the water
   column on the flood than on the ebb. Migration of mysids and amphipods
   was sufficient to override net seaward flow to produce a net landward
   flux of organisms. Migration of copepods, however, was insufficient to
   reverse or even greatly diminish the net seaward flux of organisms,
   implying alternative mechanisms of position maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{Three cDNA clones for cytochrome P450s, CYP6B2, CYP6B6 and CYP6B7 which
   have 84-87\% protein sequence identity have been isolated previously
   from Helicoverpa armigera, and the CYP6B7 mRNA was found to be
   over-expressed in a pyrethroid-resistant field population. Subsequent
   analysis has shown that over-expression is observed in a majority of
   individuals in all populations tested. Single-pair crosses between
   resistant and sensitive individuals indicated that the pyrethroid
   resistance co-segregated with the over-expression of this mRNA. Southern
   analysis indicated that the over-expression, which was confined to
   midgut only in many insects, was not related to gene amplification.
   These observations add weight to the conclusion that CYP6B7 is the
   cytochrome P450 form involved in pyrethroid resistance, and that
   over-expression of cytochrome P450 CYP6B7 is a common cause of
   pyrethroid resistance in H. armiger a. The results suggest that specific
   probes for CYP6B7 protein or mRNA could provide the basis for the
   development of tools for monitoring pyrethroid resistance due to mixed
   function oxidase activity in field populations of this insect. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Fungicides inhibiting sterol biosynthesis are frequently used for
   powdery mildew control and can be subdivided into sterol demethylation
   inhibitors (DMIs) and morpholines with different modes of action.
   Whereas fungicide resistance to DMIs (Rdmi) and morpholines (Rmor) has
   been continuously monitored, there are no data available on the
   combination of Rdmi and Rmor, which led us to ask whether multiple
   resistance to triadimenol (Rtria), representing DMIs and to
   fenpropimorph (Rfen), representing the morpholines, evolved in France
   from 1993 to 1996. The method used allowed testing of both chemicals
   simultaneously, with the same inoculum. In 1993, the resistance factor
   of the mean (RFM) of the French wheat mildew population was 9.59 for
   Rtria and 5.11 for Rfen. Resistance increased, leading to RFMs of close
   to 14 for Rtria and 8 for Rfen at the end of the study. From the
   analysis of single colony isolates (SCI) that are genetically uniform,
   the presence of multiple resistance and its increase were evident and in
   line with the results of bulk isolates. Covariance of resistance to both
   chemicals was close to one. In contrast to the increase of Rfen, the use
   of morpholines decreased. These effects are supposed to result from
   multiple selection due to the use of mixtures of DMIs and morpholines
   that have been favoured in recent years.
   Fungicide sensitivity is, in general, not normally but lognormally
   distributed in a population. A new way to evaluate and describe
   lognormal data is presented. It is easy and convenient to use and
   provides solutions for current problems in the literature with lognormal
   distributions, Multiple resistance, its evolution and persistance are
   discussed in relation to fungicide use and to implications for
   anti-resistance strategies. (C) 1998 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to extract information relevant for agriculture in
   remotely sensed wheat crops, MIVIS hyperspectral images are analysed in
   the visible and near-infrared domains. Through the selection, by means
   of a principal component analysis (PCA), of two endmembers of wheat,
   related respectively to well-developed and stressed plants, a water
   deficiency is detected among the spectral population of wheat. The image
   is then modeled by a spectral mixture analysis (unmixing) of these two
   wheat endmembers rs, soil, and shade. Resulting fraction images are
   interpreted in terms of crop vitality (level of green biomass) in
   relation to stress presence and compared to field knowledge. In
   addition, these Images allow mapping the leaf area index (LAI) over the
   whole scene, with an empirical relationship based on 12 ground
   measurements of this variable. This work shows the interest of the
   approach combining PCA and unmixing for stress detection and napping of
   agronomic variables, with a good accuracy compared to spectral ratio
   analysis. It provides relevant support for crop monitoring and precision
   agriculture, by means of numerical cartographic products obtained by
   hyper- (super-) spectral remote sensing. It demonstrates the need for
   improved methodologies derived from hyperspectral data analysis, and
   reveals that, through such methods, one can, however, retrieve a
   significant amount of information with limited number of spectral
   channels (10-20), highlighting the potential of superspectral
   observations. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.}},

Abstract = {{In spiny lobster, Panulirus argus (Latreile), fisheries in Cuba, Mexico
   and the Bahamas, artificial shelters (casitas) are successfully used as
   fishing gears. However, the mechanisms underlying the operation of these
   artificial shelters and their long-term effects on the resource and
   benthic communities are unclear. Lowered predation-induced mortality due
   to casitas has led to the proposal that they be placed in benthic
   habitats with adequate food, but where natural shelter is lacking. In
   this study, firstly the availability of natural habitat types was
   measured and secondly, habitat features which could influence the
   occupancy of artificial shelters by lobsters were evaluated. Casitas
   were placed in benthic habitats differing in the relative availability
   of seagrass and hard bottom. Spiny lobsters and faunal assemblages were
   monitored from December 1993 to July 1994 at six stations, two for each
   benthic habitat type. The study area was a typical spiny-lobster nursery
   area, with bottom cover dominated by seagrass and macroalgae (79.7\%);
   while hard bottom, including patch reef, amounted to only 0.2\%. Hence,
   a population bottleneck probably occurred, negatively affecting
   postalgal juveniles and subadult lobsters. The results suggest that
   seagrass availability was the key factor determining casitas' occupancy
   by lobsters. The lowest occupancy was found where seagrass was scarce
   and hard bottom was available. Given seagrass availability, casitas
   harbored a similar number of lobsters irrespective of the hard bottom
   availability; allowing to infer that artificial shelters provided
   critical habitats (refuges) for postalgal and subadult lobsters. The
   mean size of lobsters did not vary among stations, and commercial-sized
   lobsters were scarce. An index of predator presence showed a significant
   variation among stations and with time, with higher values from April to
   June. Sea temperature was positively correlated with lobster abundance
   and predator index; the latter two variables were not correlated. These
   study results support the use of casitas for the enhancement of preadult
   lobster populations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science BTV. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During 1991-1993 we radio-collared and monitored 50 porcupines
   (Erethizon dorsatum) on two study sites in central Massachusetts to
   quantify habitat use. During summer, porcupines were found resting
   mostly on tree limbs (greater than or equal to 80\% of locations) in
   daylight hours. During winter, they rested mostly in dens (e.g., rock
   cal es, cavities in trees) (greater than or equal to 70\%) in daylight
   hours. Where talus was abundant, porcupines rested in dens consisting of
   rock caves (90\%). Where talus was absent, they rested in cavities in
   trees (50\%) more than rock caves (27\%). During summer, their use of
   oaks (Quercus spp.) (60 and 50\% of daytime locations in each of two
   study areas) for feeding and resting was more than expected, based on
   the abundance of oaks in the two areas (corresponding abundance = 8 and
   18\%, respectively). During winter, their use of hemlocks (Tsuga
   canadensis) for feeding and resting when not in dens (93 and 71\% of
   daytime and nighttime locations, in each area, respectively) was more
   than expected (6\% in each area). The diameter at breast height (dbh) of
   red oaks (Quercus rubra) ((x) over bar: = 52 cm) used by porcupines was
   larger than a random sample in the area ((x) over bar = 27 cm). The dbh
   of hemlocks used for resting and feeding ((x) over bar: = 45 cm) was
   larger than the dbh of hemlocks used for feeding only ((x) over bar = 33
   cm) and was also larger than a random sample ((x) over bar = 35 cm).
   Porcupine selection of tree species varied between study areas according
   to availability of tree species. Their selection of den types also
   varied between areas according to availability. This study shows that
   porcupines are adaptable during the summer but are more restricted in
   their habitat use during the winter. The loss of hemlock may increase
   mortality in this population due to winter stress and predation.}},

Abstract = {{A non-destructive net aboveground primary production (NAPP) estimation
   technique which reduces the amount of labour required without
   sacrificing method accuracy was developed using phenometric models for
   nine species from freshwater Everglades wetlands. The predictive power
   of these models ranged from 90\% to 97\% and all were highly significant
   (p<0.0001). Five species' models were tested in other habitats. Three of
   these yielded non-destructively estimated biomass values that were not
   significantly different from harvested values. We also determined that a
   small sample of the total plot population could be measured and still
   yield accurate live standing crop (LSC) values using a technique similar
   to rarefaction - only 32\% of the total number of individuals within any
   given plot must be regularly monitored. We tested the accuracy of our
   method by comparing NAPP rates computed using both estimated and
   destructively obtained LSC values. Calculated NAPP rates were not
   significantly different than those produced from the more traditional
   destructive technique. NAPP rates were also computed (1) using a variety
   of computation methods and (2) using different sampling frequencies.
   Both computation method and sampling frequency had an effect on NAPP
   rates and should be considered when conducting NAPP studies. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{For Neotropical migrants, rates of nest survival and brood parasitism
   are thought to decline with the area of the forest fragment in which the
   birds nest. Using the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), we conducted
   the first test of the ``area{''} hypothesis based on direct measures of
   annual production and related demographics of marked individuals. We
   predicted that productivity per female and per ha, proportion of females
   nesting successfully each year, and return rates of adults would
   decrease and that rates of nest predation and brood parasitism and the
   ratio of yearlings:older adults would increase with a decrease in area
   of forest. Intensive season-long banding, nest finding, and nest
   monitoring to determine the annual production of all residents yielded
   data for two annual (1991 and 1992) tests in which we compared mean
   results from 14 small fragments (less than or equal to 2.1 ha) with
   those from a 15-ha site, the University of Delaware Woods (UDW).
   Fledglings per female and per ha, and percent of females fledging
   greater than or equal to 2 young per year, were lower, and percent of
   nests lost to predation and percent of nests parasitized were higher, in
   small fragments than in the larger tract at UDW in both years. The ratio
   of yearlings:older adults was significantly higher in small fragments
   for males and tended to be so for females in 1991, but neither result
   occurred in 1992. Return rate for each sex was lower in small fragments
   in the only year tested. The 17.5 ha of small fragments collectively
   produced many fewer young per female and per ha than the 15-ha UDW.
   Three analyses indicated that the small fragments were population sinks,
   whereas UDW probably was a source of recruits. Although a few small
   fragments equaled the UDW in some measures of quality, our data support
   the area hypothesis in relation to quality of breeding habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors which influence the survival of juvenile
   American Black Ducks is critical to maintaining or enhancing rates of
   recruitment, a factor important in meeting the stated population goals
   of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. To contribute to that
   knowledge base, and to compare survival on wetlands under different
   management strategies, this five-year study of radio-marked HY juvenile
   Black Ducks was initiated in the Maritime Provinces of Atlantic Canada.
   Two hundred and forty-six radio-marked juvenile American Black Ducks
   (Anas rubripes) were monitored on three study sites in New Brunswick and
   Nova Scotia during the summer/fall periods from 1987 through 1991. The
   three sites represented wetlands under the following management
   strategies: unmanaged forested (UF); managed-hunted (MH); and
   managed-sanctuary (MS). Post-fledging dispersal (greater than or equal
   to 10 km from natal marsh) was greatest (26\%) on UF and least (1\%) on
   MS. Mortality from hunting on or near natal wetlands was only slightly
   greater on MH (56\%) than on MS (48\%). One-half of the mortality from
   hunting on juveniles produced on UF occurred on nearby (10-25 km)
   managed wetlands used for fall staging. Most radio-marked Black Ducks
   migrated south by early December, and mortality from hunting continued
   through December on wintering areas in southern Nova Scotia and
   northeastern United States. Total documented mortality on juveniles from
   hunting for MH, MS and UF was 60\%, 57\% and 22\%, respectively. Managed
   wetlands on northern Black Duck breeding habitat may discourage
   post-fledging dispersal and contribute to high losses of HY juveniles to
   hunting early in the season. Size of protected wetlands and
   juxtaposition with other non-protected wetlands should be considered
   when developing sanctuaries or managed reserves to enhance Black Duck
   production and subsequent juvenile survival through the fall hunting
   season.}},

Abstract = {{The recolonization of the clonal intertidal alga Mazzaella cornucopiae
   (Postels et Ruprecht) Hommersand is considered here, as part of a larger
   project on its population ecology. Recolonization in Barkley Sound,
   Pacific Canada, started a few months after completely clearing
   experimental 100-cm(2) quadrats in late spring and occurred both by
   vegetative growth of perennating holdfasts bordering disturbed quadrats
   and by recruitment from spores. In terms of percent cover, both
   mechanisms contributed similarly to recolonization during the first 2
   years, although vegetative recolonization was highly variable among
   quadrats. Great spatial variability prevented the detection of a
   temporal pattern for recruit density on statistical grounds. However,
   cohort demography showed some degree of seasonality. Turnover rates of
   recruits were high; they lived 2.6 months on average. Recruitment was
   highest between fall or winter and midspring (as might be expected,
   given that reproductive structures appeared in fall and winter) and null
   in the first two summer seasons. The highest mortality was recorded in
   summer, when desiccation and irradiance are highest on an annual basis.
   Frond density was very variable on a spatial scale and did not follow a
   clear temporal pattern. The average number of fronds per recruit
   apparently increased between winter and summer, paralleling frond
   dynamics in mature stands. By monitoring recolonization in quadrats of
   the same size cleared previously by other researchers, the time of full
   recovery of M. cornucapiae was estimated to be 2.7-3.5 years.}},

Abstract = {{Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are multilittered synchronous breeders

   radiotelemetry to determine the effects of juvenile cohort (i.e., litter
   group) and food availability on postweaning survival of hares in the
   southwestern Yukon during the increase phase of a hare cycle. During the
   study, I monitored 86 juvenile hares from control areas and areas in
   which supplemental food was provided. Twenty-eight-day survival did not
   differ between food addition and control areas for any juvenile cohort,
   and survival rates of juveniles tall cohorts combined did not differ
   significantly from those of adults (juveniles: 0.91 per 28 days; adults:
   0.93 per 28 days). However, when examined by juvenile cohort, survival
   of third and fourth litters was significantly lower than that of adults
   and first and second litters. These differences were the result of
   differential survival among the juvenile cohorts during a 3-month period
   in the fall (September-November). Predation was the primary proximate
   cause of death for weaned juvenile hares, accounting for 86\% of deaths.}},

Abstract = {{The contamination of shellfish by pathogenic bacteria and viruses is a
   concern of shellfish producers, distributors, and consumers. To address
   these wafer quality concerns, the National Shellfish Sanitation Program
   has classified shellfish growing waters as approved conditionally
   approved, or prohibited. The Tillamook estuary is one of Oregon's
   primary shellfish harvest areas. Degradation of water qualify in
   Tillamook Bay has been linked to oyster bed closures, declines in
   salmonid populations, and decreases in recreational use of estuarine
   resources. in this study, water quality concerns related to shellfish
   management are addressed by examining the patterns of fecal coliform
   bacteria (FCB) concentration in Tillamook Bay. A one-way analysis of
   variance was used to compare log-transformed FCB concentrations in
   prohibited, restricted, and conditional shellfish management areas. We
   found (1) a difference in Tillamook Bay water quality between all three
   areas and (2) a change in FCB concentrations through time in each
   management area. Since the designation of shellfish management areas
   affects the economy and public health, monitoring practices need to be
   reevaluated in order to draw more refined conclusions about wafer
   quality trend; in Tillamook Bay.}},

Abstract = {{From 1987 to 1996 we used capture and telemetry methods to study the
   demography, movements, and population trend of grizzly bears (Ursus
   arctos horribilis) in wilderness and nonwilderness portions of the Swan
   Mountains of Montana. Most data were collected in the nonwilderness
   portion, which included public multiple-use lands and rural areas on and
   near private lands. Population density in nonwilderness averaged 1.6
   bears/100 km(2). The annual total mortality rate (13.4\%) was higher
   than that found in expanding brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations. A
   tenuous finite rate of increase (lambda) of 0.977 (95\% CI =
   0.875-1.046) was related to high female mortality. Annual mortality
   rates for bears utilizing the rural and wilderness zones was 21 and 15
   times higher, respectively, than for bears using only multiple-use
   lands. Our mortality, movement, and occupancy data suggest that the
   multiple-use zone is a population source area, and that wilderness and
   rural zones are sink areas. Mortalities in the wilderness zone were from
   mistaken identification during the black bear (Ursus americanus) hunting
   season and human defense of life. In the rural zone, mortalities were
   from malicious killing and the management removal of habituated or
   food-conditioned bears. We recommend that wildlife managers develop a
   conservation strategy to promote bear population stability or growth by
   improving female survival while minimizing bear conflicts on private
   lands. This would be accomplished by protecting core areas on public
   lands of superior habitat through access management, conducting a
   mandatory bear identification course for black bear hunters, and
   reducing anthropogenic foods on private lands. We also recommend a
   continuing population and habitat monitoring program.}},

Abstract = {{Adequate population viability assessment may require estimation of
   effective population size (N-e). But failure to take into account the
   effect of temporal fluctuation in population size (FPS) on N-e may
   routinely lead to unrealistically optimistic viability assessments. We
   thus evaluate a technique that accounts for the effect of FPS on N-e.
   Using time series of annual counts of 48 free-ranging animal
   populations, we show that N-e is dependent on timescale: as more census
   records are incorporated, estimates of FPS tend to increase, and this
   estimates of N-e tend to decrease. Estimates based on, say, 10 annual
   counts tend to grossly underestimate the influence of FPS on estimates
   of long-term N-e, often by more than 100\%. Moreover, a newly derived
   expression for the confidence intervals of N-e/N (in which N is
   population size) reveals that estimates of N-e based on only a fete
   annual counts are quite unreliable. Our work thus emphasizes the need
   for long-term population monitoring and provides a framework for
   interpreting N-e estimates calculated from limited census data.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies were conducted from 1992 to 1996 to select the most
   effective sex pheromone blend for mating disruption of the obliquebanded
   leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), in tree fruit orchards in
   Washington. Dispensers loaded with a e-component pheromone blend,
   (Z)-11-tetradecen-1-yl (Z11-14:OAc) and (E)-11-tetradecen-1-yl
   (E11-14:OAc), a 3-component blend that included the addition of
   (Z)-11-tetradecenal (Z11-14:Ald), and a I-component blend also including
   (Z)-11-tetradecen-1-ol (Z11-14:OH) were compared within 0.1-ha orchard
   plots and 100-m(2) field cages. The addition of Z11-14:Ald to the 2
   acetate components with or without Z11-14:OH did not improve mating or
   disruption of communication. No disruption occurred in field cages
   treated with E11-14:OAc alone or an 88:12 (\%) E:Z 11-14:OAc blend.
   Management of C. rosaceana with mating disruption was evaluated for 2 yr
   in three 16-ha apple orchards by using a 94:6\% Z:E11-14:OAc blend.
   Orchards were treated with 1,000 polyethylene tube dispensers per
   hectare emitting approximate to 0.9 mg of pheromone per day. Populations
   were also monitored in 3 similar 8-ha orchards treated only with
   insecticides. Catches of male moths in traps baited with synthetic lures
   and virgin females were significantly lower (92-99\%) in
   pheromone-treated than in untreated orchards. Larval population
   densities and fruit injury did not differ between treatments. No
   significant differences were found in larval population densities, trap
   catch, or fruit injury between the 2-ha center and the outer 14-ha areas
   of the pheromone-treated orchards. Significant increases in catch by
   lure-baited traps and fruit injury occurred in the pheromone-treated
   orchards from the Ist to 2nd yr of the study. The pheromone treatment
   saved approximate to\$250/ha in insecticide costs over 2 yr. arval

Abstract = {{Bollworm, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), and tobacco budworm, Heliothis
   virescens (F.), male moth activity were monitored for 15 yr (1982-1996)
   in sex pheromone traps in the Rolling Plains of Texas. The study
   consisted of 2 types of survey as follows: (1) weekly monitoring of
   bollworm and tobacco budworm moths in Hardeman and Knox counties to
   investigate their long-term seasonal activity patterns, and (2) daily
   monitoring of bollworm moths in Haskell, Knox, and Wilbarger counties to
   quantify the effect of lunar cycles on moth generation cycles. Moths
   were active from early April to late October, with increasing activity
   as the growing season of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., progressed
   through September. Although the bollworm-budworm complex in the region
   consisted of approximate to 93\% bollworms and only approximate to 7\%
   tobacco budworms, the seasonal trends in activity patterns were similar
   for both species. Correlation analyses showed a significant positive
   relationship between weekly trap catch and temperatures, but a
   significant negative relationship was observed between trap catch and
   wind velocity for both species. Although the average monthly activity
   levels were positively correlated between adjacent months, there was no
   significant correlation between the activity of the moth population that
   contributed to the overwintering generation and the following spring
   population. Mean seasonal abundance curves, with upper confidence
   limits, were constructed for each species based on 15-yr averages. The
   mean abundance curves of this type are useful for identifying years with
   unusual moth severity. Daily trap catch data showed that the moon phase
   influenced the capture of bollworm moths in pheromone traps, as
   indicated by a significant positive correlation between trap catch and
   percentage moon illumination. Daily trap catch data also showed that the
   maximum trap catch occurred 71\% of the time during the full moon,
   followed by Ist quarter (11\%), last quarter (9\%), and the new moon
   (9\%). However, the relationship between the trap catch and the lunar
   cycles was not apparent when the traps were serviced weekly, indicating
   the importance of sampling frequency in detecting the relationship
   between trap catch and moon phase.}},

Abstract = {{Maladera matrida Argaman is a key pest of peanuts (Arachis hypogaca L.)
   in Israel. The ability to predict accurately the occurrence of different
   developmental stages of this beetle may facilitate and improve the
   control of population of this pest. Thus, 4 non linear (logistic,
   exponential, sigmoid, and biophysical) models and 1 linear model were
   tested to fit the relationship between the developmental rate of M.
   matrida and temperature in a wide range of constant temperatures (20-31
   +/- 1 degrees C). The required degree-days and the developmental
   threshold were estimated from the linear portion of the biophysical
   model. which provided the best fit to the developmental rate data
   generated in the laboratory. A linear phenological model using the
   parameters derived from the biophysical model accurately predicted the
   developmental time of the early generation of M. matrida in peanut
   fields but failed to predict developmental time of Inter generations.
   Predictive extension timing estimation (PETE), a time varying
   distribution delay model, accurately predicted the occurrence of both
   early and late generations. It is critical for growers to be able to
   predict the occurrence of Ist instars in the soil of germinating peanut
   fields following the emergence of the pest after overwintering. This
   information allows peanut growers to be prepared with monitoring and
   control devices to reduce the damage caused by M. matrida to peanuts.}},

   Components and development of a pheromone lure for population monitoring}},

Abstract = {{The sex pheromone components of Choristoneura parallela (Robinson) were
   investigated using gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection
   (CC-EAD) and CC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of sex pheromone
   glands and gland-released volatiles. Analysis of gland-released
   volatiles indicated the presence of (E)-11-tetradecenol (E11-14:OH),
   (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11-14:Ac), and (Z)-11-tetradecenol
   (Z11-14:OH). Whole-gland extracts contained the above components as well
   as (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (Z11-14:Ac), and tetradecanol (14:OH).
   The E11-14:OH/E11-14:Ac ratios in the gland and effluvia were similar to
   4:1 and 20-50:1, respectively. The cis isomers of both the 11-14:OH and
   11-14:Ac were present in the gland at 3-5 and 1-2\% of that of the
   corresponding E isomers, respectively. The presence of tetradecanol
   (14:OH), a preciously identified component in the gland, could not be
   confirmed by GC-EAD or GC-MS in the effluvia Among the various blends
   evaluated in the field, blends containing E11-14:OH (major pheromone
   component), E11-14:Ac, and Z11-14:OH in the range of 100:1-4:1-5 ratios,
   respectively, were equally effective in trapping C. parallela moths. The
   ratio of E11-14:OH to E11-14:Ac appears to be more critical than the
   ratio of E11-14:OH to Z11-14:OH. Moth catches were significantly lower
   in traps baited with E11-14:OH, E11-14:Ac, Z11-14:OH, and 14:OH in the
   ratios of 100:1:1:1-10 than in traps baited with the first 3 components
   alone at 100:1:1 ratio. Addition of Z11-14:Ac to blends containing the
   above 3 components in a 100:4:5 or 100:1:5 ratio did not improve trap
   catches. Rubber septa containing E11-14:OH, E11-14:Ac, and Z11-14:OH, in
   100:4:5 ratio, at 30 to 3,000-mu g loading of the major component were
   evaluated in a field test. Moth catches were not significantly different
   among traps baited with 300 to 3,000-mu g lending of the major
   component. In 2 separate field tests, traps baited with the above 3
   components in 100:4:5 ratio captured as many moths as traps baited with
   the most attractive 4-component blend identified in a previous study.}},

Abstract = {{Residents living near a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility
   expressed concern to health officials over chemical emissions from the
   plant. Environmental monitoring of ambient air near the plant indicated
   the presence of toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which was used in foam
   production. Heath officials collected blood samples from 113 residents
   and analyzed the blood sera for antibodies to TDI and related
   diisocyanates. Ten of the 113 residents (9\%) had elevated levels of IgG
   or IgE antibodies specific for one or more diisocyanates. Exposure
   histories were taken from antibody-positive individuals to identify
   possible occupational exposure to TDI or the use of
   diisocyanate-containing consumer products. Exposure to TDI in ambient
   air may be responsible for the positive antibody responses detected in
   some residents of the community.}},

Abstract = {{During the past thirty years, researchers have been documenting the
   concentrations and effects of persistent toxic substances, such as DDT,
   PCBs, dioxins and furans, in populations of Great Lakes organisms. In
   designing the International Joint Commission's Workshop on Environmental
   Results, the organizers on the Great Lakes Science Advisory Board
   started from the premise that the selection of indicator organisms for
   long-term trend analysis requires that the causal relationships between
   the observed effects and the putative cause should be demonstrated and
   believed. However, the causal relationships that have been documented
   have generally been met with skepticism by fellow scientists and by
   regulatory officials resulting in no agreement on valid indicator
   organisms. To overcome this skepticism, wildlife, fisheries and human
   health researchers have adapted the epidemiological criteria used by
   medical and veterinary researchers for synthesizing the causal evidence.
   Brief reviews of several candidate species and of their suitability as
   long term monitors are presented, and the adequacy of monitoring
   programs for determining trends in the incidence of chemically-induced
   effects is assessed.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and population structure of the serpulid polychaete
   Ditrupa arietina were assessed along the section of the Mediterranean
   coast between Barcelona and Montpellier. The study combined: (1) the
   analysis of the existing historical data referring to the period before
   the 1970s; (2) the results of impact assessment surveys carried out in
   the late 1980s and the 1990s; and (3) the results of two surveys carried
   out in the Bay of Blanes and along the coast between Cape Cerbere and
   Port-la-Nouvelle during 1996. The results of the surveys carried out in
   the 1990s show the occurrence of high densities (i.e. >1000 ind m(-2))
   of Ditrupa arietina at all the sites sampled. These results can be
   compared with the few reports of this species before 1970, leading to
   the conclusion that D. arietina has recently increased all along the
   Catalan coast. Ditrupa arietina is preferentially found between 20 and
   30 m depth, which mostly corresponds to well-sorted fine sands and muddy
   sands. Both the results of population monitoring and the heterogeneity
   of population structure at small spatial scale show that the dynamics of
   this species is unstable. The observed distribution pattern is therefore
   interpreted as resulting from a response to both wide-scale
   environmental parameters (accounting for the dramatic increase of the
   species at a wide geographical scale), and to local environmental
   factors (accounting for small-scale heterogeneity in population
   structure). Analysis of the relationship between sedimentary data and
   densities of D. arietina suggests that this species is highly sensitive
   to the presence of fine sediments. However, because of the regional
   importance of the phenomenon, it is concluded that the dramatic increase
   of D. arietina along both the Spanish and the French Catalan coast does
   not result from sediment instability. (C) 1998 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Growth rate, temporal variability and secondary production were
   quantified for the Mediterranean gorgonian Paramuricea clavata off Medes
   Islands, NW Mediterranean. Fifty-four colonies ranging in size between 5
   and 860 cm in total length (3-55 cm maximum height) were monitored
   photographically for 2 years. Growth varied between and within years.
   Primary branches accounted for 91\% of production, though their growth
   rates were highly variable (on average 23\% of branches displayed zero
   growth). The gross growth rate of primary branches in colonies <20 cm
   was higher (0.8 cm year(-1)) than that of colonies >20 cm (0.5 cm
   years(-1)). On average, net growth of primary branches (0.4 cm year(-1))
   was approximately 60\% of positive growth. There was a significant
   size-specific negative growth effect in which year smaller colonies
   displayed higher rates of loss. Mean growth in colony height was 1.8 cm
   year(-1) (range: 0.2-6.4 cm year(-1)). Based on growth rate data, the
   largest colonies in the population (55 cm) were around 31 years old. On
   average, year net production for an colonies was 75\% of gross
   production. Gross production was 4.4 g AFDW m(-2) year(-1), the
   production/biomass value was 0.11, and the turnover time was 9 years.
   Growth rate and its variation with colony size are discussed within the

Abstract = {{Concern regarding the ecological impact of rapid global warming has
   encouraged research on climate-induced changes in biological systems.
   Critical problems, still poorly understood, are the potential for rapid
   adaptive responses and their genetic costs to populations. The O
   chromosomal polymorphisms of Drosophila subobscura have been monitored
   at a southern Palearctic locality experiencing sustained climate warming
   since the mid-1970s. Observations suggest that the population is rapidly
   evolving in response to the new environmental conditions, and has lost a
   significant amount of chromosomal diversity (18.3\% in 16 years). These
   findings are consistent with results from another population of D.
   subobscura, which is also undergoing climate warming, and are in accord
   with what would be expected from latitudinal and seasonal patterns of
   the various inversions. In addition, data on the O chromosomal
   polymorphisms from other localities throughout the range of this species
   suggest that other populations vary similarly.}},

Abstract = {{To improve ecological relevance, regulatory agencies are promoting
   assessments of effects at higher levels of organization, an objective
   that requires an understanding of current ecological theories. One such
   theory, hierarchy theory, contends that the effects of a disturbance
   acting at one level of organization (e.g., population) are not, as a
   rule, transmitted to higher levels of organization (e.g., community).
   Conversely, effects at higher levels of organization only occur if lower
   level variables have been affected. Further, responses to disturbance
   depend on disturbance history. In this study, I determined the effects
   of a disturbance treatment at the population, guild, and community
   levels of organization for vegetation in five wetlands with a
   disturbance history ranging from highly to rarely disturbed. The 2-year
   field experiment revealed that the effects of the disturbance treatment
   were most strongly felt at the population level of organization in
   wetlands without a history of disturbance. These observed impacts took
   place against a backdrop of constant change. Thus, the eventual
   disappearance of treatment effects was not due to a return to the
   pre-treatment state, but rather a return to a trajectory similar to that
   exhibited by the control plots. The implications of these results for
   ecological risk assessment are: (1) the observed effects of a stressor
   in a system cannot be extrapolated to other systems unless they have
   similar disturbance histories, (2) detecting effects before they become
   serious requires monitoring at lower levels of organization, (3)
   recovery to a naturally innate state is not a viable concept, and (4)
   the traditional approach of using one post-treatment measurement to
   determine if reference and impact sites differ is of very questionable
   value.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-tags were used to track 146 Buzzards Buteo buteo during 1990-1996.
   Each bird was tracked for up to 4 years; of 74 Buzzards tagged since
   1992, 72\% were monitored for more than 3 years, Among the 87 Buzzards
   tracked for more than 1 year, 46\% settled after one dispersal movement,
   37\% dispersed and then changed their ranges, 17\% did not disperse and
   one Buzzard alternated between a summer and a winter range. Natal
   dispersal occurred in two waves, one in the first autumn and the second
   in the following spring, Initial dispersal distances in the autumn were
   significantly greater than those in the spring. For 73 Buzzards that
   dispersed in their first autumn, 96\% settled within 100 km of their
   natal nest, and their distances were similar to 76 records from ringing,
   After their second spring, Buzzards rarely changed ranges and were
   significantly more often to the east than the west, especially those
   that had dispersed more than 20 km, Buzzards that had dispersed farthest
   were most likely to be detected returning towards their natal area each
   spring and returned earlier as they got older. However, none was
   detected returning once it had started to breed, Nine early breeders
   were significantly farther from their natal nests than 44 nonbreeders.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the areawide corn rootworm, Diabrotica spp., management
   project is to determine if corn rootworm populations can be reduced to
   and maintained below economically damaging levels throughout a large,
   contiguous area by coordinating the control of the adults before they
   mate and the females lay eggs. Iowa's Areawide Project is being
   conducted on 41 km(2) in Clinton County. The county is located in east
   central Iowa and is bordered on the east by the Mississippi River. The
   topography is rolling and, because much of the land is erodible, very
   few soybeans {[}Glycine mar (L.) Merrill] are grown in the area. Of the
   4,144 ha in the area, >2,400 ha was planted to corn (Zea mays L.) in
   1997. Approximately 90\% of the corn was planted where corn had been
   planted the previous year. Hay is grown as a strip crop between corn and
   grass waterways, and terraces are prevalent. During 1997, adult corn
   rootworm emergence began on 12 July, about 10 d later than normal due to
   below-normal temperatures in May and June. Pherocon(R) AM sticky traps
   were placed in fields between 21 and 25 July to monitor beetle density.
   Beetle populations were very high in nearly all fields. Threshold beetle
   numbers of six beetles per trap per day were reached in about 30\% of
   the fields by 28 or 29 July. Applications of the insecticidal bait
   SLAM(R) (560 g/ha in 3.8 liters of water) began on 5 August. SLAM
   contains a feeding stimulate (buffalo gourd powder, 87\%) and carbaryl
   insecticide (13\%, 73 g/ha). Of the 2,440 ha of corn planted in 118
   fields, 2,269 ha (93\% of the corn) was sprayed initially. About 10 d of
   residual activity was obtained with the SLAM treatments. When beetle
   densities returned to four beetles per trap per day, the fields were
   resprayed. Resprays began on 22 August and 1,222 ha (54\% of the corn)
   was retreated. No fields were sprayed more than twice. Larval
   root-injury ratings and adult emergence from the soil in 1998 will be
   used to determine the effectiveness of the adult management program.}},

Abstract = {{Pheromone-based management of codling moth {[}Cydia pomonella (L.)] in
   apple (Malus spp.) was investigated over a 3-yr period. The experimental
   design was a direct comparison of pest control in six orchards treated
   with pheromone and six adjacent comparison orchards that were under
   either a conventional program or an organically approved program. Good
   suppression of codling moth was consistently achieved with single
   applications of Isomate-C dispensers in three of the six
   pheromone-treated orchards. Initial densities of codling moth were low
   at these three sites. Pheromone treatments were less effective at sites
   with moderate to high codling moth pressure. Population densities of
   nontarget pests and their natural enemies, as well as the use of
   insecticides to control them, also were monitored in pheromone-treated
   and comparison orchards. Leafrollers (Tortricidae) showed the greatest
   potential for increased pest status in pheromone-treated orchards.
   Increases in leafroller densities were recorded by the second year in a
   majority of pheromone-treated blocks and, in the absence of supplemental
   control with insecticides, two sustained fruit damage >3\%. Predatory
   mites and the leafminer parasitoid Pnigalio flavipes (Ashmead) were
   effective biological control agents in both pheromone-treated and
   comparison orchards. The densities of some natural enemies were
   significantly higher in pheromone-treated than in conventional orchards.
   The observed levels of predators and parasitoids, however, were highly
   variable from orchard to orchard and it was unclear whether they
   provided biological control of pests. Aphid predators and the egg
   parasitoid of white apple leafhopper (Typhlocyba pomaria McAtee),
   Anagrus sp., were particularly abundant in pheromone-treated blocks.}},

Title = {{Bioindication using trap-nesting bees and wasps and their natural
   enemies: community structure and interactions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{1, Results from four field studies show that communities of trap-nesting
   bees and wasps and their natural enemies are promising bioindicators for
   ecological change or habitat quality. These small and easy-to-handle
   communities can be analysed with respect to (i) species richness and
   related parameters, and (ii) ecological functions or interactions. The
   communities comprise Hymenoptera (Apidae, Sphecidae, Eumenidae,
   Pompilidae) and natural enemies belonging to many insect taxa. Traps
   consisted of 150-200, 15-20-cm long, reed internodes, put into tills or
   plastic tubes of 13-15 cm diameter; wooden posts with 2-10 of such
   reed-filled tins were exposed ill the target habitat.
   2, Species richness and abundance of bees (but trot wasps) were closely
   related to plant species richness of the habitat, a measure of the bees'
   food resource. However, availability of nest sites of above-ground
   nesting species was equally important: meadows with old trees supported
   greater populations than meadows without trees. A threefold increase in
   exposed traps resulted in a twofold increase in species.
   3. The sensitivity of this bioindicator system profits from the fact
   that evaluations rely not only on presence/absence data, descriptive
   population attributes or diversity indices, but also on interactions or
   ecological functions. Monitoring ecological responses or multitrophic
   interactions, and their relationship to species diversity, is rarely
   done but much needed. Ecological functions include (i) the percentage
   mortality of trap-nesting bees and wasps due to parasitoids and
   predators, which was correlated with the species richness of these
   natural enemies; (ii) seed set of allogamous plants due to successful
   pollination by trap-nesting bees; and (iii) biological control by the
   predacious wasps.
   4, With increasing isolation of fragmented habitats (when traps were
   exposed in a cleared agricultural landscape), both species richness of
   natural enemies and percentage mortality (parasitism and predation)
   declined significantly. In a comparison of habitat types (grasslands and
   field mal-gins), species richness of the trap-nest community correlated
   with plant diversity, but percentage mortality, due to parasitism and
   predation, with field age only. The threshold distance to the nearest
   habitat was 106-530 m for a 10 50\% decrease in mean mortality, and the
   mortality increased greatly in habitats that were older than 5 years.
   Accordingly, these studies emphasize the significance of a continuum of
   old habitat patches for the augmentation of nat ural enemies.
   5, Exposure of standardized traps is an experimental approach with a
   small, interacting and reproducing community that can be easily
   characterized by simple parameters. Taxonomy and biology are well known,
   and quick evaluations can be done using the close correlation between
   the number of occupied traps and species richness. Species richness of
   trap-nesting bees and wasps was closely correlated with that sampled by
   sweep nets. Further criteria of indicator taxa that apply to this system
   are discussed in the text.}},

Abstract = {{Female calling behaviour and male response to natural and synthetic
   pheromone sources were used for a Portuguese population of the winter
   pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Den. \& Schiff.).
   Virgin females 1-5 days old were studied, the mean calling longevity
   being 3.3 +/- 0.7 days. Calling started approximate to 3 h after the
   onset of scotophase, and 7 h after emergence, lasting, nightly, for 6.4
   +/- 0.7 h, and was not affected by female age. A drop in air
   temperatures during the first half of scotophase and an increase in
   light intensity at dawn apparently determined the onset and termination
   of calling. Male flight activity began, on average, 3 h before the
   females started emitting pheromone, and was similarly affected by air
   temperatures and light intensity. The attractivity of traps baited with
   synthetic pheromone (TP056A; Yne 11, Z13-16AC) was compared with that of
   virgin females. Male flight activity was monitored in central and
   southern Portugal, using pheromone traps, and seen to last between 6 and
   10 weeks, with a major peak occurring, in all sites, at the beginning of
   September.}},

Abstract = {{H. obsoletus is the vector of grapevine yellows (Vergilbungskrankheit,
   VK) in Germany. Monitoring the abundance of the vector populations and
   their infestation with the phytoplasma associated with VK is necessary
   to assess the risk of disease outbreaks and field-spread. We tested
   planthoppers collected in four different vineyards of the Mosel River
   valley in Germany for infection by VK using DAS-ELISA and PCR. ELISA
   readings of female planthoppers were significantly higher than those of
   males. The proportion of positive testing H. obsoletus was higher in PCR
   tests compared to ELISA. The trapping method, either sweep-net or
   sticky-trap, had no significant influence on the proportion of
   planthoppers that reacted positively in PCR tests. The infestation of
   vineyard populations estimated by PCR varied between 7\% and 34\%. Batch
   samples, prepared from mixtures of crude planthopper extracts or from
   groups of 25 planthoppers, proved to be reliable for the detection of a
   single infected vector. For routine monitoring, we suggest PCR tests of
   batch samples from sticky traps.}},

Abstract = {{Diet incorporation and spray chamber assays compared the activity of
   three commercial formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner against
   Heliothis virescens (F.), Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), Pseudoplusia
   includens (Walker), and Spodoptera exigua (Hubner). The commercial
   products evaluated were Condor OF(R) (Ecogen Inc., Langhorne, PA), Dipel
   ES(R) (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and Javelin WG(R)
   (Sandoz Crop Protection Corp., Des Plaines, IL). Variation in results of
   the diet incorporation studies illustrated the importance of including a
   standard reference formulation in the design of the studies and
   suggested that some standardization of insect strains used in such
   assays may be important also. Overall results of the diet incorporation
   studies were similar to those obtained in the spray chamber studies
   where insects were assayed on sprayed cotton and soybean. Dose-mortality
   regressions were developed for each B. thuringiensis formulation applied
   against each insect species on cotton and soybean over a 28-day
   observation period. These regressions may be helpful in the development
   of recommendations for the use of B. thuringiensis on cotton and
   soybean. They may also have value in establishing base-line levels of
   susceptibility for future resistance monitoring efforts. Median lethal
   concentrations (LC50s) tended to be slightly higher on cotton than on
   soybean. The most susceptible insect species was H. virescens, and the
   least susceptible was S. exigua. LC50s for H. tea and P. includens were
   similar and intermediate between those of H. virescens and S. exigua.
   Javelin WG tended to exhibit the highest activity per unit weight of
   commercial product, but the relative differences among the commercial
   formulations were influenced by insect species.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of irrigation and soybean maturity group (Group V `Forrest'
   variety vs Group VII `Braxton' variety) on the seasonal abundance of
   arthropod pest and beneficial population densities were examined in
   large-plot field tests at the Attapulgus Research center in Attapulgus,
   GA, in 1987 through 1990. In general, soybean plant growth was more
   abundant, yields were higher, and canopy closure indices were lower in
   irrigated than in non-irrigated plots for both varieties. irrigation and
   the resultant increased soybean vegetation supported a greater overall
   seasonal abundance of all five of the insect pests monitored: stink
   bugs, primarily Nezara: viridula (L.), velvetbean caterpillars,
   Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, soybean loopers, Pseudoplusia includens
   (Walker), threecornered alfalfa hoppers, Spississtilus festinus (Say),
   and green cloverworms, Plathypena scabra (F.). No overall varietal
   effects were noted for N, viridula; however, each year, population
   densities were higher in the early-maturing `Forrest' up to julian day
   250 then densities were higher in the later-maturing `Braxton' for the
   remainder of the grown season. Mean estimates of the seasonal abundance
   of A. gemmatalis and P. scabra populations were similar between the two
   varieties; however, P. includens and S. festinus were more abundant on
   Forrest than on Braxton. Total arthropod predators, including Nabis
   spp., Geocoris spp., and spiders, also were more abundant on irrigated
   soybeans, while overall varietal means were similar. Yearly analyses
   revealed significant irrigation and variety effects for most of the,
   species sampled.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies of health effects of air pollution often must
   rely on only one monitoring site to characterize the exposure of a large
   population. This is reasonable if ambient air pollution concentrations
   have limited spatial variability within the study area. To verify this
   assumption in an area with many local sources of pollutants, the spatial
   variability of particle strong acidity (PSA), aerosol sulfate, and PM10
   was studied in Erfurt, Eastern Germany. Fine-particles (PM2.5) and
   coarse particles (PM10) were collected using Teflon membrane filters.
   The fine particles were analyzed for PSA and sulfate. Samples were
   collected simultaneously at four sites: one located downtown (D), one at
   the border of the downtown area (ERF), and one each at a northern (N)
   and at a southeastern (SE) suburban locations. The distance between the
   downtown area and the suburban stations was about 4-5 km.
   Because the two suburban locations were not affected by local emissions,
   the measured concentrations were highly correlated and did not differ
   appreciably from each other In contrast, the inner-city sites showed
   more variability since these locations may be affected by local sources.
   Statistically significant differences in levels between the downtown
   site (D) and the two suburban sites (N and SE) for sulfate (up to 17\%)
   and PM10 (30-40\%) were observed With respect to cross-sectional
   epidemiological studies, for which the knowledge of the absolute
   pollutant concentration levels is of importance, the results suggest
   that population exposure estimated by the use of only one monitoring
   site may be inaccurate. This is especially possible in communities with
   substantial sources of pollutants and during periods of low wind speed.
   Epidemiological studies evaluating acute effects, for which the
   demarcation of episodic periods may be sufficient, are not as adversely
   affected by the use of a single monitoring site in a study region. The
   relatively high inter-site correlations for sulfate and PM10 (r greater
   than or equal to 0.9) between SE, D, and N would indicate that regional
   episodes of this pollutant can be identified with only one monitoring
   site. The correlations between the ERF site and the other sites were
   weaker; especially on days with low wind speed since the ERF sire may be
   more strongly influenced by local sources and local traffic due to its
   short distance from a major road. This indicates that even time series
   studies may suffer from misclassified exposures depending upon the
   particular choice of monitoring site and the coincidence of air
   pollution episodes with periods of low wind speed. Our data
   constellation shows that the slope estimate in a univariate model would
   be underestimated by 35\% for PM10 and 22\% for sulfate when using the
   ERF site compared to using the average of all sites for the analysis of
   epidemiological time series data. Since sulfate shows less spatial
   variability than PM10, they may serve as better marker for episodes.}},

Abstract = {{Methods are needed for estimating long-term ozone concentrations in
   epidemiology studies. The objective of this study was to apply and
   compare several alternative spatial interpolation models in a set of
   long-term average ozone data from 1112 U.S. monitoring sites in
   operation between 1981 and 1990. The comparison of methods was carried
   out for five different metrics of ozone concentration: the daily
   one-hour and eight-hour maxima, the average concentrations between 10AM
   and 6PM, between 10AM and 10PM, and the sum of all hourly ozone
   concentrations greater than or equal to 60 ppb. We also tested whether
   estimates were more precise when covariates (population density,
   elevation, meteorology) were added to the interpolation models. Results
   of our study showed that the ozone monitoring network is useful for
   estimating spatial patterns in long-term average ambient ozone
   concentrations. Reasonably good interpolations were possible using a
   variety of models; optimal results were obtained using a
   regression-based interpolation on three nearest sites. Inclusion of
   covariates in the interpolation models did not substantially improve the
   estimates. The largest estimation errors occurred where ozone
   concentrations were highest. The results of this work imply that
   reasonably precise long-term ozone concentration estimates can be
   achieved throughout the U.S. by interpolation of ozone concentrations
   between available U.S. monitoring sites.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the potential impact of the European green crab Carcinus
   maenas (Linneaus) (Decapoda: Portunidae) on possible prey species in
   British Columbia, Canada, and Washington State, USA. This crab was first
   observed on the west coast of North America in San Francisco Bay, CA, in
   1989. In early 1997, adult green crab were found in Coos Bay, Oregon,
   about 300 km further north than its previous known range limit (Humbolt
   Bay, CA). Ocean current transport of larvae may introduce it to Canada
   in the near future. The green crab is a versatile predator with a
   preference for molluscan and crustacean prey. In the Pacific, green crab
   seem to thrive best in habitats protected from oceanic swell, and the
   Strait of Georgia/Puget Sound are expected to provide ideal habitat, as
   are coastal estuaries in Washington State. These areas are main
   production areas for both intertidal bivalves and Dungeness crab (Cancer
   magister Dana) fisheries. It is expected that both bivalve and crab
   fisheries will be negatively impacted by the presence of green crab.
   Deltas in the Strait/Sound also support extensive migrating shorebird
   populations. Any change in densities of small invertebrates arising from
   green crab occurrence and predation may affect these migrating species,
   with ecological implications extending far beyond the actual potential
   range occurrence of green crab. We discuss the need for monitoring
   measures which will document the impact of this exotic species on local
   ecosystems when it ultimately extends its range to Canada.}},

Abstract = {{The world population of the Lesser Grey Shrike funnels in from breeding
   grounds in Eurasia to an area that is ten times smaller on the
   non-breeding grounds in the thornbelt of southern Africa, chiefly in the
   Kalahari basin. The species is abundant in open savanna habitat on the
   non-breeding grounds, where it is regularly spaced in individual
   territories and behaves conspicuously as a perch hunter. It has declined
   considerably during the last 200 years, and the non-breeding grounds
   offer highly favourable conditions for assessing and monitoring the
   world population. Extrapolation according to vegetation types of
   stratified survey data across southern Africa indicates a world
   population of 6.1 million birds (95\% confidence 5.0-7.3 million) during
   the mid 1990s. However, for sensitive monitoring, the establishment of a
   standard-effort index is more appropriate than the assessment of the
   total population.}},

Abstract = {{Insect populations infesting wheat stored in four bins on two Kansas
   farms were monitored from early July 1996 through to the middle of
   January 1997, Estimates of adult insect density based upon the numbers
   of adult insects caught using probe traps differed from those based upon
   the number of insects found in grain samples. These differences were a
   result of differences in numbers of insects found and percentages of
   traps or grain samples with insects. Traps detected insects 15 to 37 d
   earlier than grain samples, The depth of traps below the grain surface
   tended to influence both the total number and species composition of the
   insects that were caught. Traps inserted with the top just below the
   grain surface collected an average of 1.9 times more Cryptolestes
   ferrugineus (Stephens), 1.2 times more Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), 4.1
   times more Ahasverus advena (Waltl) and 77.4 times more Typhaea
   sterdominica (L.) than traps inserted with the top 7.6 cm below the
   grain surface, However, trap depth did not have a significant effect on
   the number of R, dominica caught and on only 12 to 21\% of sampling
   dates did trap depth have a significant effect on the number of insects
   of other species that were caught, Grain temperatures in three of the
   bins averaged 30 degrees C during the first 70 d of storage and then
   decreased by 0.2 degrees C/d. Grain in the other bin was initially more
   than 10 degrees C warmer and grain temperature decreased by 0.2 degrees
   C/d over the full storage period. The numbers of insects captured in
   traps decreased as grain temperature decreased even though grain samples
   indicated that insect populations were still growing, Thus, trap catches
   did not estimate insect population density consistently throughout the
   storage period, A method was developed in the current paper to adjust
   for the effect of seasonal changes in temperature on trap catch.

Abstract = {{We translocated wild cougars (Puma concolor) with known social and
   behavioral histories to evaluate the feasibility of translocation as a
   management tool to reestablish populations, relieve the threat of
   inbreeding in isolated populations, and manage problem individuals.
   Eight female and 5 male cougars 16-108 months old were translocated a
   mean distance of 477 lan from the San Andres Mountains (SAM) study area
   in southcentral New Mexico to 9 release sites in northeastern New Mexico
   (NENM) from December 1990 through June 1991 and then radiomonitored
   through January 1993. Another male cougar was translocated 338 lan from
   the SAM to northwestern New Mexico in April 1989 and monitored until May
   1990. Initial movement directions away from release sites were uniformly
   distributed about a 360 degrees circle. Eight (4 F, 4 M) of 14 cougars
   had movement end points >80 km from their release sites, and end point
   directions were generally south, suggesting they homed toward the source
   population; 2 male cougars returned to their original home ranges.
   Dispersing cougars from a SAM reference population showed no southerly
   tendencies. Distances moved from release sites to end points ranged from
   3 to 494 lan; 4 cougars (3 F, 1 M) established home ranges less than or
   equal to 84 lan from release sites. Mean pretranslocation home ranges
   were generally smaller than mean posttranslocation use areas. Nine of 14
   translocated cougars died during the study. Annual survival rates of
   translocated cougars did not differ by sex and were lower in 1992 than
   survival rates of cougars from the reference area. We concluded that
   translocation was most successful with cougars 12-27 months old.}},

Abstract = {{Aging mammals by the cementum-annuli method to count incremental growth
   layers in the roots of teeth is a technique that many wildlife managers
   use to monitor the demographic structure of populations. However,
   managers of bison (Bison bison) herds have not been able to use this
   aging technique, because a correlation between the cementum age and the
   known age of an animal has never been established. This paper presents
   the results of a study designed to fill that void and establish whether
   bison can be aged accurately by the number of incremental growth bands
   present in the roots of their teeth. The results indicate bison do
   produce regular cementum annuli in the roots of teeth that correspond
   accurately with age.}},

Abstract = {{Survival and cause-specific mortality rates between yarded and nonyarded
   white-tailed deer populations have not been preciously studied with the
   use of radiotelemetry. We captured, radiocollared, and monitored the
   survival of 103 adult male and female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) in northern and southern New Brunswick from February 1994
   through May 1997. Annual survival rates for adult does in northern New
   Brunswick were higher than those for females in the south but were not
   different for adult males between the 2 study areas. Six of 37 adult
   female mortalities in the northern, yarded population died as a result
   of coyote (Canis latrans) predation (0.098); doe harvest was illegal in
   this portion of the province. However, in the southern population, where
   a limited number of antlerless permits were issued but deer did not
   concentrate in traditional deeryards, 9 of 21 adult female mortalities
   were from hunting-related causes (0.114). Mortality rates for adult
   females as a result of predation did not differ between the 2 study
   areas (0.098 for north, 0.058 for south), and mortality rates of
   northern females (0.151) did not differ from hunting-related mortality
   rates for does in the south (0.128). A majority of adult males in
   northern New Brunswick died as a result of predation and hunting-related
   causes, while most (5 of 10) mortality in the southern study area
   resulted from legal harvest. There were no differences in adult male
   mortality rates among seasons or between study areas (P > 0.05). Annual
   survival of adult white-tailed deer in New Brunswick, where deer exist

Abstract = {{Forest-nesting raptors are often difficult to detect and monitor because
   they can be secretive, and their nests can be difficult to locate. Some
   species, however, respond to broadcasts of taped calls, and these
   responses may be useful both in monitoring population trends and in
   locating nests. We conducted broadcast surveys on roads and at active
   red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) nests in northcentral Minnesota to
   determine effects of type of call (conspecific or great horned owl
   {[}Bubo virginianus]), time of day, and phase of the breeding cycle on
   red-shouldered hawk response behavior and to evaluate usefulness of
   broadcasts as a population monitoring tool using area
   occupied-probability-of-detection techniques. During the breeding
   seasons of 1994 and 1995, we surveyed 4 10-station road transects 59
   times and conducted 76 surveys at 24 active nests. Results of these
   surveys indicated conspecific calls broadcast prior to hatch and early
   in the day were the most effective method of detecting red-shouldered
   hawks. Probability of detection via conspecific calls averaged 0.25, and
   area occupied was 100\%. Computer simulations using these field data
   indicated broadcast surveys have the potential to be used as a
   population monitoring tool.}},

Abstract = {{Because logging has replaced fire as the most extensive and frequent
   disturbance regime in northeastern Minnesota, monitoring bird
   populations and their habitats has become increasingly important. We
   surveyed early-successional forests created by fire or logging for birds
   and their habitat during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons. We found
   that overall bird species richness and number of individuals
   (territorial males/ha) were higher (P < 0.05) in burned forests than in
   logged forests. The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), house wren
   (Troglodytes aedon), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas),
   clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), song sparrow (Melospiza
   melodia), Lincoln's sparrow (M. lincolnii), and brown-headed cowbird
   (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in burned areas. The Nashville
   warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla), chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica
   pensylvanica), black-throated green warbler (D. virens), and mourning
   warbler (Oporornis agilis) were present in greater numbers in the logged
   areas. We related these differences in bird presence and abundance to
   vegetation differences in the burned and logged habitat types. Burned
   areas had higher densities of dead trees, wider size ranges of dead
   trees, and greater heterogeneity in the shrub layer. Logged areas had
   higher densities of live trees, more live tree species, and wider size
   ranges of live trees. Red maple (Acer rubrum) was the live tree species
   found in greatest abundance in logged areas. If management goals include
   simulating natural disturbances like fire and maintaining bird
   populations, more dead trees should be left within logged habitats and
   the variability among logged areas should be increased.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced survival of chicks may result from exposure to insecticides and
   may explain declines in northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus)
   populations on agricultural landscapes. To determine the risk
   insecticides pose to quail, we quantified exposure rates and hazard.
   Exposure rate depends on quail habitat use in relation to insecticide
   applications, whereas hazard depends on susceptibility to a toxin and
   the dose an individual receives. Because providing early-successional
   vegetation around row-crop fields is a typical habitat management
   recommendation, we determined rates of exposure of quail and their
   broods to insecticides applied to soybean fields with and without
   vegetated field borders. Radiocollared quail (n = 69) used soybean
   fields extensively (64\% of telemetry locations) at the time of year
   insecticides were applied. Quail used soybean fields twice as often when
   vegetated borders surrounded crop fields (P = 0.04). Ten of 18 broods
   monitored by telemetry were located in soybean fields 88\% of the time.
   In 1993, 4 of 6 broods <14 days old were in crop fields at the time
   insecticides were aerially applied. Mesocosm trials simulating
   worst-case exposure of quail chicks to insecticides resulted in no chick
   mortality or depression of brain cholinesterase (ChE) activity for the
   currently used insecticides thiodicarb and methomyl (P > 0.49). However,
   ChE activity was depressed (P < 0.001) and body mass was lower (P =
   0.02) in chicks exposed to methyl parathion, which historically
   (pre-1980) received significant use in production of row crops in North
   Carolina. Our results, along with data on use and toxicity of other
   insecticides applied to row crops, collectively suggest direct affects
   to survival of quail chicks from use of foliar-applied insecticides does
   not explain reduced quail densities on agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal Variation in reproduction and population size structure was
   investigated for the suspension-feeding bivalve Limopsis tajimae Sowerby
   inhabiting the upper bathyal zone (300 m deep) of Suruga Bay, central
   Japan. The bivalve was collected at 1- to 4-month intervals for a period
   of 22 months, and bottom environment was monitored concurrently to
   detect factors affecting seasonality in the bivalve. Bottom water
   temperature, organic carbon and nitrogen contents in the sediments did
   not exhibit seasonal variation. Size-adjusted soft-tissue weight varied
   slightly, but statistically significantly between stations and months.
   However, its seasonal pattern was not obvious, and the pattern of
   temporal variation was totally different between stations. The sex ratio
   did not deviate from 1:1, and there was no significant difference
   between shell lengths of females and males. Females possess both
   immature small oocytes and large developed oocytes in their ovaries
   throughout the year, suggesting that they can potentially undergo
   year-round continuous reproduction. The proportion of developed oocytes
   in each female varied greatly from month to month, although no seasonal
   cycle was obvious. Population size structure of L. tajimae was
   polymodal. A mode of the smallest size class occurred in most months,
   suggesting long periods of bivalve recruitment. These findings indicate
   that seasonal variation in reproduction of the bivalve was negligible,
   probably reflecting constant physical and nutritive conditions of the

Abstract = {{Habitat utilization and prey species of Vancouver Island gray whales
   were investigated by (1) summarizing 26 yr of distribution and feeding
   data and (2) conducting intensive observations in Clayoquot Sound,
   Vancouver Island, from 1989 to 1996. Whale distribution and movements
   were monitored from March to November through systematic boat surveys
   and whale-watch sighting programs. Prey species were collected by
   suction hose and plankton net or determined through analysis of fecal
   samples. Gray whales utilized virtually all of the southern west coast
   of Vancouver Island over the 26-yr observation period. Distribution,
   prey species, and feeding behavior showed marked variability during any
   one season and between years. Some feeding areas were used on an annual
   basis, others with >10-yr intervals between use. Feeding occurred in
   shallow sand or mud bays, eel grass beds, kelp beds, in the open water
   column, and at the surface. Young whales appeared to utilize habitat and
   prey species differently than adults. Main prey species included herring
   eggs/larvae (Clupea harengus pallasi), crab larvae (Cancer magister
   megalops, Pachycheles spp. zoea), mysids (Holmesimysis sculpta, Neomysis
   rayii, Acanthomysis spp.), amphipods (Ampelisca spp., Atylus borealis),
   and ghost shrimp (Callianassa californiensis). The definition and
   relative importance of specific feeding grounds and the study of human
   impacts on this population are complicated by its broad and variable use
   of habitat and prey species.}},

Abstract = {{Field trials were carried out in 1995 and 1996 on farms in the
   south-west of England to assess the extent to which odour-baited targets
   could be used to suppress populations of the ectoparasitic blowfly,
   Lucilia sericata, in sheep pastures. Targets were constructed from 41 x
   41cm squares of aluminium sheet, covered by white cloth which had been
   dipped in a mixture of sucrose solution (50\% w/v) and the chitin
   synthesis inhibitor triflumuron (10\% suspension concentrate). Each
   target was baited with approximate to 300 g of liver and sodium sulphide
   solution (10\%). Three matched sheep farms were used in the trials. In
   1995, triflumuron-impregnated targets were placed around the periphery
   of sheep pastures at one of the farms in late June, at approximately one
   target per hectare. In 1996, triflumuron-impregnated targets were placed
   around the periphery of sheep pastures of a second of the farms in early
   May, at approximately five targets per hectare. Each year, five sticky
   targets, used to monitor the L. sericata populations, were also placed
   in fields at the experimental and the other two farms, which acted as
   controls. In 1995, the results provided some, although inconclusive,
   evidence that the triflumuron-impregnated targets had reduced the
   numbers of L. sericata relative to the populations on the two control
   farms. In 1996, however, the density of L. sericata on the experimental
   farm was reduced to almost zero and remained significantly lower than on
   two control farms throughout the period during which the
   triflumuron-impregnated targets remained in the field. The results are
   discussed in relation to the use of triflumuron-treated targets as a
   practical means of controlling L. sericata and sheep blowfly strike.}},

Abstract = {{Predation by small mammals is thought to be one of the main regulators
   of outbreaking sawfly species. It has been suggested that predation may
   be lower in poor and dryish forests, and this is the reason why
   outbreaks often begin from this type of environment. We studied
   experimentally how fertility of the forest site affects cocoon predation
   experienced by two sawfly species, the common pine sawfly Diprion pini
   (Linnaeus) and the European pine sawfly Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffroy).
   We applied a fertilization treatment to selected pine-dominated barren
   forest sites in Finland, and 2-4 years later monitored predation on the
   sawfly cocoons in fertilized and control areas. The results did not
   support the idea that forest fertility was related to cocoon predation.
   We also could not verify that small mammal abundance was related to
   fertility of the forest. The most obvious pattern we observed was that
   the two sawfly species differed dramatically in predation experienced.
   N. sertifer has its cocoon phase in mid-summer and experienced only
   moderate predation (37\%) whereas D. pini, with its cocoon phase in
   autumn, suffered from very heavy predation (96\%). Our observations
   suggest that if predation is important in controlling the population
   dynamics of the species, its impact depends more on the sawfly species
   and season than on the fertility of the forest site.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the spatial distribution of turtle nest sites
   and nest predation was investigated in a landscape encompassing a 12-ha
   freshwater wetland in west-central South Carolina, USA. The goals of the
   study were to determine if nest predation is a function of nest density,
   and if two other spatial factors, habitat type and distance of nests
   from the wetland, influence survival rate. Gravid females of three
   turtle species (Kinosternon subrubrum, Pseudemys concinna floridana, and
   Trachemys scripta) inhabiting the wetland were monitored from the time
   they exited the wetland to nest until they returned from their nesting
   forays. A total of 145 nests were located during three nesting seasons
   (1992-1994). Nests were monitored from the day of oviposition until they
   were deemed to have successfully produced hatchlings or depredation was
   documented.
   The three-year mean predation rate was 84.2\% (80\%, 88\%, and 81\% for
   1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively). Modeling of the point pattern of
   nest locations suggests that nests were distributed at varying densities
   and that density changed with habitat type and distance to the wetland.
   Logistic regressions of predation rates against two crowding indices
   demonstrate no significant evidence for density-dependent nest
   predation. Furthermore, autologistic regression provided no evidence
   indicating that nest survival is dependent on the survivorship of
   neighboring nests. Logistic regressions of predation rates against
   habitat type and distance from the marsh of origin suggest that
   predation rate is not a function of these two spatial characteristics.
   In summary, no evidence was found that linked predation rate to any of
   the spatial characteristics of nest distribution that were examined. The
   lack of density dependent nest predation is contrary to findings from
   some previous avian and chelonian studies, but supports the findings of
   other researchers. It is suggested that predation during the current
   study was either density independent or that any local density effects
   were masked by an ideal free distribution of turtle nests. Our data
   support the findings of several researchers that suggest density, as a
   single factor, is not a generalizable predictor of nest predation
   probability.}},

Title = {{Relations of forest cover and condition of elk: A test of the thermal
   cover hypothesis in summer and winter}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{1998}},
Number = {{141}},
Pages = {{5-61}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Many biologists have accepted the concept that the weather-sheltering
   effect of dense forest cover (i.e., thermal cover) reduces energy
   expenditure of large ungulates and therefore enhances survival and
   reproduction. Providing thermal cover for ungulates has become a key
   habitat objective for western elk ranges. However, it remains uncertain
   that thermal cover significantly influences the nutritional condition,
   survival, or productivity of wild ungulates. During 1991-95, we tested
   the hypothesis that the sheltering effect of thermal cover is of
   sufficient magnitude to enhance condition of elk (Cervus elaphus
   nelsoni) during summer and winter. Relative condition of captive young
   cows was monitored during 4 winter and 2 summer season-long experiments.
   These elk were placed in pens (2-3 elk per pen, n = 12 pens) at the
   center of 2.3-ha treatment units, each unit providing 1 of 4 levels of
   cover: (1) dense cover (greater than or equal to 70\% forest canopy
   closure), (2) moderate cover (40-69\% canopy closure), (3) zero cover
   (complete clearcut), and (4) a combination of dense cover and zero
   cover. Controlled diets were set to induce moderate mass loss (5-10\%)
   in winter and moderate growth in summer. Solar and net hemispherical
   radiation flux, windspeed, temperature, and relative humidity also were
   measured in the treatment units.
   We found no significant, positive effect of thermal cover on condition
   of elk during any of the 6 experiments. In contrast, dense cover
   provided a costly energetic environment, resulting in significantly
   greater overwinter mass loss, fat catabolism, and (in 1 winter)
   mortality. These results were consistent in all 4 winters despite
   variable temperature regimes ranging from mild to relatively severe. In
   summer, we found no significant effects of forest cover on condition or
   growth of yearlings, although elk in dense forest cover generally
   consumed less water than those in the zero or moderate cover treatments.
   Our data indicated that (1) the enhanced performance of elk with Little
   or no thermal cover in winter was due to the greater levels of solar
   radiation Aux and (2) potential energetic benefits of thermal cover
   (from reduced windspeed, elevated nocturnal temperature, and nocturnal
   long-wave radiation flux during winter and shading from solar radiation
   in summer) were negligible in respect to the thermoregulatory
   capabilities of elk.
   We conclude that (1) thermal cover does not appreciably enhance the
   energetic status and productive performance of elk in climatological
   settings similar to those of our study, (2) providing thermal cover is
   not a suitable solution for inadequate forage conditions, and (3)
   habitat management based on the perceived value of thermal cover should
   be re-evaluated. Elk biologists should refocus their attention to the
   influences of forest management on (1) forage resources and related
   production potential of forest successional stages and (2) vulnerability
   of ungulates to harvest and harassment. Because the majority of
   empirical support for the thermal cover hypothesis is derived from
   observational studies of habitat selection, our findings amplify the
   difficulty associated with determining need or requirement, relevant in
   the context of population productivity, from empirical observations of
   habitat use.}},

Abstract = {{The preservation of lead within human tissue makes it possible to
   monitor long-term exposure to the element and to model changing sources
   of lead pollution throughout the lifetime of an individual. Dental
   tissues have recently been shown to be particularly useful for this
   purpose. Enamel, for instance, forms at known stages of life and is
   chemically stable in vivo whereas dentine is remodelled in a predictable
   fashion. The relative stability of enamel is reflected in its excellent
   post-mortem preservation. This raises the possibility of using
   historical or archaeological material to reconstruct long-term trends
   and establish baseline data relating to exposure among pre-industrial or
   even prehistoric populations. The use of archaeological material is
   currently problematic, however, because of the site-specific nature of
   diagenesis and incomplete understanding of its chemistry, particularly
   in respect of lead uptake into dental tissue from the burial
   environment. A detailed study of lead distribution within both ancient
   and modem human teeth is presented. Conclusions are drawn on the pattern
   of lead distribution resulting from tissue formation and the manner of
   its alteration in the burial environment. In particular, attention is
   drawn to a consistent enrichment of lead within the outer 30 mu m of the
   enamel of both ancient and modern teeth which appears to be unrelated to
   diagenesis. The implications for current approaches to long-term
   monitoring and for the reconstruction of historical and archaeological
   exposure patterns are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A neurophysiological assay was used to record and compare target-site
   sensitivities to the pyrethroid insecticide, allethrin, in larvae and
   adults of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.) and larvae of
   the bollworm, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie). High frequencies of target-site
   resistance were measured in larval H. virescens and expression was
   greater in early- than late-season collections. Adult H. virescens also
   expressed reduced sensitivity to allethrin, but frequency distributions
   were not statistically different from that of a laboratory-reared
   susceptible strain. Target-site sensitivity was similar between larvae
   from laboratory-susceptible and field-collected strains of H. tea during
   1995, but low frequencies of target-site resistance were detected in
   larvae collected from conventional and transgenic cotton during 1996.
   The significance of these findings with respect to the utility of the
   adult vial test as a monitoring tool and the continued control of H. tea

Abstract = {{This study: (i) established that the introduced papaya fruit fly,
   Bactrocera papayae Drew and Hancock, was not present in three widely
   separated rainforest sites; (ii) established, based on our knowledge of
   host use, the suitability of those sites as habitat for the papaya fruit
   fly; and (iii) raised the question of potential impacts of papaya fruit
   fly invasion of rainforests on the local and endemic fauna and flora.
   Data were collected between February and June 1996 from vegetation
   surveys, fruit fly trapping and records of insects reared from fruits
   collected in rainforest plots. The vegetation survey results indicate
   that habitat suitability for the papaya fruit fly is highly variable
   between the three sites sampled. No papaya fruit fly individuals were
   collected over the course of the study, either from traps or reared from
   collected fruits. Endemic tephritid species were, however, collected
   using both of these sampling methods. Based on analyses of potential
   host availability, the papaya fruit fly has the potential to become
   established in any of the three 1 ha plots surveyed. There is currently
   a lack of evidence to confirm or refute the presence of populations of
   the papaya fruit fly in rainforest areas. Highly focused monitoring
   strategies need to be employed to further assess the status of this
   species and the potential environmental and ecological impact(s), if
   any, that have escaped current detection. Ultimately, many native and
   endemic species of fauna and flora may be endangered by this species
   should populations become established in the rainforests of North
   Queensland.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative scares for 4 behavioural patterns, especially those of an
   antagonistic nature, were recorded from wild individual of Mus musculus
   musculus Linnaeus, 1758 living in semi-confinement in an outdoor
   enclosure divided into four pens. The enclosure was ``permeable{''}, in
   that mice were able to move between pens and between the enclosure and
   the outside. The population was monitored by the capture-mark-recapture
   method. In the spring of 1988 and 1989 the behaviour of mice trapped in
   the enclosure was studied in unisexual encounters in a neutral arena.
   There were no significant differences in scores for behaviour in
   relation to the degree of spatial separation of the places of capture of
   individuals paired together (except in the number of attempts to escape
   noted for females in 1989 and the total activity noted for males in
   1988). Males and females did not differ significantly in scores for
   aggressive behaviour, but mice were more aggressive and more active in

Abstract = {{The feeding behaviour of Cicadulina storeyi China on healthy and
   virus-infected plants of maize varieties with different levels of
   resistance to maize streak geminivirus (MSV) was studied using an
   alternating current (AC) electronic monitor. Three maize varieties were
   rested: 8321-21 (fully resistant), 8329-15 (moderately resistant) and
   FR114 x FR303 (susceptible). Typical waveforms that have previously been
   associated with salivation, ingestion and non-probing activities were
   recorded. Variety and disease status influenced feeding behaviour.
   Leafhoppers probed more frequently, had a higher number of non-probing
   activities such as walking or resting, and a significantly shorter
   duration of phloem feeding on healthy plants of 8321-21 compared to
   those of other varieties. These results suggest that 8321-21 manifests
   antixenosis-type resistance to C. storeyi. The percentage of time spent
   on patterns associated with phloem ingestion was significantly greater
   on healthy plants of all varieties than on virus-infected ones. The
   significance of Cicadulina feeding behaviour in relation to transmission
   of MSV is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Aspects of the ecology of a suburban population of rainbow lizards,
   Agama agama Linnaeus 1758, have been studied in Malindi, a coastal
   locality of SE Kenya. Four different family groups were monitored on a
   wall transect 120 m long. Each group constituted a dominant male (i.e. a
   brightly coloured and aggressive individual) and three to four adult
   females, but in one of the studied groups a subordinate male was also
   seen. Both sexes were active in the morning, and peak activity fell
   between 10.00 and 11.30 hours. Dominant males used elevated perches
   significantly more often than subordinate males and females. The diet
   consisted of terrestrial arthropods, and most of the prey eaten were
   beetles (6-8 mm long). The foraging strategy used by rainbow lizards was
   to eat small insects at very short time intervals. The lizards used
   sit-and-wait foraging, remaining motionless until the prey was <5 cm
   away. The rainbow lizards studied did not feed upon plant material.}},

Volume = {{152}},

Abstract = {{For capital breeders, mass may affect reproductive potential.
   Reproductive expenditure may reduce future reproductive potential,
   particularly when resources are scarce. To test the hypothesis that
   reproductive success and the costs of reproduction vary according to
   mass and population density, we analyzed 25 yr of data on bighorn ewes
   (Ovis canadensis). The number of adult females was first limited by
   yearly removals, then allowed to triple. We found no survival costs of
   reproduction for ewes aged 4-7 yr. For ewes aged 8-14 yr, survival was
   density dependent for barren ewes but not for ewes that weaned lambs.
   Failure to lamb was rare and negatively correlated with fertility the
   following year. At low population density, lactation had a negative
   effect on mass gain but had a limited reproductive cost. At high
   density, heavy ewes had higher reproductive success than light ewes, and
   the reproductive cost and somatic costs of reproduction increased. The
   cost of reproduction was greater for light than for heavy ewes. Survival
   of weaned lambs to 1 yr was affected by population density but not by
   maternal mass or previous reproductive success. In large mammals,
   manipulations of reproductive effort are problematic, but long-term
   monitoring of individual mass and reproductive success under varying
   conditions of resource availability can provide insights into the
   evolution of life histories.}},

Abstract = {{Large amounts of vertebrate remains regurgitated by owls are potentially
   available for continuous monitoring of predated populations, without
   human interference or the need to sacrifice any specimens. Presumably,
   Pleistocene and Holocene fossil microvertebrate assemblages found in
   caves or shelters are also principally the result of predation by
   nocturnal birds. Our study tests, for the first time, the standard
   skeletochronological technique on such prey remains. We analyse two
   Spanish samples from the genus Discoglossus (Amphibia, Anura,
   Discoglossidae), a living population of D. galganoi (n = 65 individuals)
   predated by the European Barn Owl, Tyto alba, and a Pliocene-Pleistocene
   sample of an extinct species (n = 22) presumably predated by Tyro
   balearica, a closely related ancestor of T. alba. The histological
   peculiarities and alterations found in bones of both samples are
   described, but the results indicate that, in general, this type of
   material is suitable for skeletochronological applications. In the
   living population, both size and longevity were greater than previously
   recorded for the species. For both samples, size and age are positively,
   though weakly, correlated. Comparisons by age-class show that the
   extinct species is larger than the living one, particularly for 4- and
   5-year-old individuals. Growth rates in juveniles (or larvae) of the
   extinct species should have been slightly higher than in the living
   species, with similar growth rates after the third year. Recorded
   longevity is higher in the extinct species. All these life-history
   traits support a distinct taxonomic status for the extinct Balearic
   Discoglossus species.}},

Abstract = {{The web-spinning sawflies of the genus Cephalcia Panzer (Hymenoptera,
   Pamphiliidae) are usually monitored by sampling prepupae in soil and by
   catching adults with visual traps, including yellow sticky traps.
   However, adult catches have never been compared with the actual density
   of prepupae. In this paper, a relationship is presented between the
   catches of Cephalcia arvensis Panzer adults (mostly males) and the
   number of prepupae ready to emerge (pronymphs) in ail outbreak area of
   spruce forest (Picea abies Karsten) in the Southern Alps (Asiago,
   Italy). A significant linear relationship between the logarithmic
   estimates of the two variables was found. The model includes a spatial
   autoregressive parameter because adult catches were spatially
   correlated. The relationship allows to know whether or not the
   defoliation threshold of 20 pronymphs/m(2) in spring samples is being
   exceeded, based on the number of adults caught on yellow sticky traps
   (defoliation threshold of 14.26 adults/trap). The variance not explained
   by the model is probably due to the flight behaviour of adult males, to
   the low precision of the estimated pronymph density at low population
   levels, and to the attraction of males by few females that are trapped
   and remain alive. The model was validated in a large monitoring
   programme of undamaged alpine spruce forests and allowed detection of
   two newly infested stands out of six that were considered at risk of
   defoliation, because of adult catch exceeded the threshold. Low adult
   catches were always associated with absence of defoliation. Our
   conclusion is that trapping of adult sawflies is a cheaper and easier
   monitoring method than prepupae sampling in the soil. This makes earlier
   detection of outbreaks possible, and consequently more efficient
   control.}},

Abstract = {{French populations of the codling moth Cydia pomonella (L.)
   (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae), a major pest in apple and pear orchards,
   have developed resistance to different classes of insecticides including
   the benzoylurea diflubenzuron, a chitin synthesis inhibitor. Ovicidal
   tests performed on two susceptible strains and one strain selected for
   its resistance to diflubenzuron revealed the same order of magnitude in
   resistance ratios to this compound (30-fold) and two other benzoylureas
   teflubenzuron and flufenoxuron (22- and Ii-fold, respectively). Field
   rates of these three compounds induced a 45-55\% decrease in hatching in
   the resistant strain, compared to over 90\% in the susceptible insects.
   Despite a 52-fold ovicidal resistance ratio to the juvenile hormone
   analog fenoxycarb, this compound induced a 85\% decrease in hatching in
   the resistant strain. Conversely the newly hatched larvae of the
   resistant strain exhibited a 45 000-, 33- and 2.1-fold resistance ratio
   to diflubenzuron, teflubenzuron and flufenoxuron, respectively. The
   latter value was not significant, and the field rate of flufenoxuron
   killed over 97\% of the resistant larvae while diflubenzuron had no
   effect. This lack of relationship between ovicidal and larvicidal
   resistance may be due to different transport properties together with
   differential enzymatic metabolization. Our results may limit the
   validity of substitution instars, which approach is frequently used for
   resistance monitoring. More importantly for resistance management, the
   resistance of different target instars to each compound has to be
   considered when establishing control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{We present an approach to estimate hourly grid-cell surface ozone
   concentrations based on observations from point monitoring sites in
   space, for comparison with grid-based results from the SARMAP
   photochemical air-quality model for a region of northern California.
   Statistical estimation is carried out on a transformed (square root)
   scale, followed by back-transforming to the original scale of ozone in
   parts per billion, adjusting for bias and variance. We estimate a
   spatially-varying diurnal mean structure and a non-separable space-time
   correlation structure on the transformed scale. Temporal pre-whitening
   is followed by modelling of a spatially nonstationary, diurnally-varying
   spatial correlation structure using a spatial deformation approach.
   Comparisons of SARMAP model results with the estimated grid-cell ozone
   levels are presented.}},

Abstract = {{During the summers of 1991-1994, the Environmental Monitoring and
   Assessment Program (EMAP) conducted variable probability sampling on 344
   lakes throughout the northeastern United States. Trophic state data were
   analyzed for the Northeast as a whole and for each of its three major
   ecoregions-the Adirondacks (ADI), the New England Uplands (NEU), and the
   Coastal Lowland and Plateau (CLP)-and inferred to the entire population
   of lakes greater than or equal to 1 ha (N = 11,076). Results were
   compared to a large, nonrandomly sampled data set for the same area
   compiled by Rohm and others and contrasted with lake trophic state
   information published in the National Water Quality Inventory: 1994
   Report to Congress {[}305(b) report. Lakes across the entire Northeast
   were identified by EMAP data as 37.9\% (+/-8.4\%) oligotrophic, 40.1\%
   (+/-9.7\%) mesotrophic, 12.6\% (+/-7.9\%) eutrophic, and 9.3\%
   (+/-6.3\%) hypereutrophic. Lakes in the ADI and NEU generally are at a
   low, nearly identical trophic state (96\% oligotrophic/mesotrophic),
   while those in the CLP are much richer (45\% eutrophic). EMAP results
   are similar to results of the Rohm data set across the entire region. In
   the CLP, however, EMAP identified approximately 45\% of the lakes as
   eutrophic/hypereutrophic, while the Rohm data set identified only 21\%
   in these categories. Across the entire Northeast, the 305(b) report
   identified a much higher proportion (32.2\%) or lakes in eutrophic
   condition and a much smaller proportion (19.8\%) in oligotrophic
   condition than did the EMAP survey data(12.5\% +/- 7.9\% and 37.9\% +/-
   8.5\%, respectively). Probability sampling has several advantages over
   nonrandom sampling when regional resource condition assessment is the
   goal.}},

Abstract = {{Data on the annual production per area of mosses used as biomonitors is
   of major importance in the calculation of heavy metal deposition rates
   derived from concentration values. Therefore, annual biomass production
   per area was determined for Hylocomium splendens (127 +/- 61 gm(-2)
   yr(-1)), Pleurozium schreberi (161 +/- 56 gm(-2) yr(-1)), Hypnum
   cupressiforme (188 +/- 62 gm(-2) yr(-1)) and Abientinella abietina (144
   +/- 45 gm(-2) yr(-1)) at 54 sites in Austria. Annual increments were
   detected by morphological criteria. Central European populations of
   mosses produce on average 10\% (H. splendens) and 39\% (P. schreberi)
   more biomass per area than populations from Northern Europe or Canada.
   Due to great differences in biomass production at various sites it is
   suggested calculating heavy metal deposition rates by using mean values
   only for larger areas and to take only data from accurate measurements
   of annual growth rates for the calculations of the depositions at single
   sites.
   A comparison between heavy metal concentrations (As, Cd, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe,
   Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) in H. cupressiforme and A. abietina showed
   comparable uptake efficiences for both mosses with somewhat higher
   values (quotient < 1) in H. cupressiforme. These results correspond with
   those obtained from other monitoring species (e.g. H. splendens).}},

Abstract = {{Embryos and newly hatched larvae of three amphibian species, the spotted
   salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), the northern leopard frog (Rana
   pipiens), and the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), were exposed to
   fluoranthene and ultraviolet (UV) light in two scenarios. Embryos were
   exposed in a laboratory setting from an early developmental stage
   through hatching under artificial UV light and newly hatched larvae were
   exposed outdoors in varying sunlight intensity levels. Outdoor exposures
   greater sensitivity in the toxic response than did laboratory exposures.
   In the laboratory, mortality and malformation of X. laevis were the most
   sensitive indicators of exposure. Xenopus laevis was also the most
   sensitive species tested to the effects of UV light alone. Hatching
   success of R. pipiens was monitored outdoors and was not a useful
   predictive endpoint in the determination of photoinduced toxicity;
   however, newly hatched larvae were: sensitive to the effects of
   photoinduced toxicity. Amybstoma maculatum and X. laevis larvae were
   affected by low (mu g/L) concentrations of fluoranthene in sunlight.
   These findings suggest that low levels of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons could be acting synergistically with environmental factors
   such as UV light to place young amphibians at risk.}},

Abstract = {{The development of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr was monitored
   during the first year in a fresh-water hatchery environment to test

   (s)AAT-4{*}, IDDH-1{*}, IDDH-2{*}, IDPH-3{*}, sMDH-3,4{*} and mMEP-2{*})
   is associated with growth (body mass, fork length) and maturity status
   (mature male Fair). The length frequency distribution of population was
   unimodal in September, but was clearly bimodal by December. UMG fish
   tended to be more heterozygous and had higher growth rates than LMG
   fish. The heterozygosity of UMG fish and mature male parr (MMP) did not
   differ significantly but MMP showed lower growth rates than UMG. There
   were positive correlations between the number of heterozygotic loci and
   the fork length, weight or growth rates of individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the population density of the cereal cyst nematode,
   Heterodera avenae, were monitored in four soils in microplots for 10
   years. For the first 4 years, half of the microplots were treated each
   year with drenches of formalin (38 \% formaldehyde) prior to sowing with
   susceptible cereals. Thereafter, plots were sown with susceptible or
   resistant spring barley or ryegrass to manipulate the numbers of female
   nematodes and eggs produced each year. After the fourth application of
   formalin, the densities of the nematophagous fungi, Nematophthora
   gynophila and Verticillium chlamydosporium, were estimated under each
   crop in untreated soil and soil previously treated with the partial soil
   sterilant. Formalin significantly increased nematode populations and
   reduced the densities of the nematophagous fungi in all soils. By the
   second year of formalin application, nematode population densities in
   all soils had increased to levels which caused crop failure in winter
   wheat; thereafter, populations declined under spring barley unless
   applications of formalin were continued. Despite continuous cropping
   with susceptible cereals, populations of the nematode were often not
   detectable in plots after the eighth year. Changes in the densities of
   spores of the fungi in soil were closely related to changes in the
   numbers of nematodes. In soils previously treated with formalin, the
   fungi had increased to levels similar to those found in naturally
   suppressive soils within 3 years of discontinuing formalin application
   and population densities of the nematode had declined to the same levels
   as in untreated soils. (C) Orstom/Elsevier, Paris.}},

Abstract = {{1. We tested for costs of chick rearing in the black-legged kittiwake
   Rissa tridactyla (Linnaeus) by removing entire clutches from 149 of 405
   randomly selected nests, in which one or both mates was colour-banded.
   After the manipulation, we monitored adult nest attendance and body
   condition at unmanipulated and manipulated nests, and measured the
   survival and fecundity of these adults the following year.
   2. Late in the chick-rearing period, adults from unmanipulated nests
   (i.e. with chicks) went on significantly longer foraging trips, and were
   significantly lighter for their size, than adults from manipulated nests
   (i.e. without chicks).
   3. Adults from unmanipulated nests also survived to the following
   nesting season at a significantly lower rate than those from the
   manipulated nests (0.898 vs. 0.953), suggesting that attempting to raise
   chicks can reduce life expectancy by 55\%.
   4. There was a tendency for adults from nests that were unmanipulated in
   year one to have lower reproductive success in year two, primarily
   because of reduced hedging success, and a higher incidence of
   non-breeding.
   5. These findings suggest that mass loss in kittiwakes during chick
   rearing may not be adaptive. Raising chicks can lead to reproductive
   costs, and the causal mechanism appears to be a reduction in body
   condition.
   6. We compare our results with previous brood (or clutch) size
   manipulation experiments that have measured adult body condition,
   survival and/or future fecundity. Although the empirical evidence
   suggests that long-lived species are more likely to experience survival
   costs than short-lived species, we believe the opposite may be true. We
   suggest that shifting the experimental protocol of cost of reproduction
   studies from brood enlargements (an approach taken in most prior
   studies) to brood reductions will provide more accurate quantifications
   of naturally occurring costs.
   7. The cost of reproduction is one mechanism proposed to explain the
   reduced survival rates reported for kittiwake populations in the North
   Atlantic relative to those in the North Pacific ocean. Oceanographic
   data, however, suggest that lower food availability may limit survival
   of kittiwakes in the North Atlantic where a deeper mixed layer and
   reduced primary production combine to make conditions less favourable
   for this seabird during the winter months.}},

   Immersion-challenged fish began excreting virus within 2 d after
   challenge. The rate of IPNV excretion per fish increased steadily from
   about day 4 to day 8 and then decreased. Virus concentrations in tissues
   of immersion-challenged fish increased exponentially. Susceptible fish
   became infected with IPNV within 4 d after being introduced to
   immersion-challenged fish (e.g., 2 d after the challenged fish began

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of the white-throated savanna monitor lizard,
   Varanus albigularis, was examined in the arid savanna of Etosha National
   Park, Namibia. Both sexes were solitary during the the hot/wet season
   when prey were abundant, and during the hot/dry season when prey
   populations were declining. Male-male and male-female behavioral
   interactions were confined to a 2-3 week period at the transition from
   the cool/dry to the hot/dry seasons when prey populations were depleted.
   Interactions occurred at locations occupied by estrus females. Male-male
   interactions were restricted to resident males chasing intruding males
   after visual contact Males appeared to initially locate the general area
   occupied by females through scent cues. Once in visual contact with
   females, males exhibited a spasmodic body shudder, after which females
   responded by flattening their bodies. Mating generally occurred in
   trees. No aggression was noted between pairs during courtship or mating.
   At peak estrus, females had elevated (100 to 500-fold increase over
   non-reproductive period) plasma testosterone and total estrogen titers.
   Males showed similar dramatic increases in plasma testosterone levels
   during the mating period. Aspects of the reproductive biology of this
   species are discussed in the context of general patterns for the family

   the length of gestation, but highly variable in length of incubation.

Abstract = {{We studied the occurrence of exposure to Upper Respiratory Tract Disease
   (URTD) in gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) at protected sites in
   southern Mississippi (Marion County Wildlife Management Area {[}MCWMA])
   and east-central Florida (Kennedy Space Center {[}KSC]). Based on
   antibody assays, exposure to URTD was very common in both populations,
   with combined positive and suspect results ranging from 60\% (KSC) to
   100\% (MCWMA). At KSC, males were significantly more likely to show
   positive or suspect results than were females. Tortoises with active
   signs of URTD were seen at KSC but not at MCWMA. Our data do not support
   the hypothesis that exposure to URTD is associated with human
   disturbance or habitat destruction; several sites that had good habitat
   conditions and little disturbance by humans had high rates of
   URTD,whereas some sites with high levels of disturbance had low rates of
   URTD. Long-term monitoring of populations with positive antibody test
   results is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Lyme disease, caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most
   frequently reported arthropod-borne disease in the United States. To
   develop a national map of the distribution of the vectors of B,
   burgdorferi to humans (Ixodes scapularis Say and Ixodes pacificus Cooley
   \& Kohls ticks),we sent questionnaires to acarologists, health
   officials, and Lyme disease researchers; surveyed the 1966-1996 MEDLINE
   data base; and reviewed 1907-1995 National Tick Collection data. Tick
   collection methods cited included nagging and dragging, deer surveys,
   small- and medium-sized mammal surveys, CO, baiting, and receipt of tick
   submissions. A total of 1,058 unique, county-specific I. scapularis and
   I. pacificus records was obtained. Tick populations were classified as
   ``reported{''} (<6 ticks and 1 life stage identified) or
   ``established{''} (greater than or equal to 6 ticks or >1 life stage
   identified). Established populations of I. scapularis were identified in
   396 counties in 32 states in the eastern and central United States,
   whereas established populations of I. pacificus were found in 90
   counties in 5 western states. Counties with established populations were
   most concentrated in the northeastern, upper northcentral, and
   west-coastal states but were also clustered in southeastern and
   Gulf-coastal states. A less concentrated distribution was found in the
   south-central states. Reports were notably missing from all but a few
   counties in Ohio, West Virginia, western Virginia and North Carolina,
   Kentucky, and Tennessee. They were absent in the Great Plains and Rocky
   Mountain regions and from large areas of western states east of the
   Cascade and Sierra Nevada cordilleras. These data are useful for
   identifying areas of Lyme disease risk, for targeting Lyme disease
   prevention strategies, and for monitoring trends in spatial distribution
   of Lyme disease vector ticks.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly samples of biting Simulium ochraecum s.l. Walker were collected
   before and after ivermectin treatment in southern Mexico and analyzed
   for Onchocerca volvulus Leuckart infection rates, infection intensity.
   and the characteristics of larval distribution among parous flies. The
   variance over mean ratio (VMR) indicated that in all cases this
   distribution departed from Poisson and was strongly aggregated (VMR >
   1). The negative binomial was found to be an adequate model with a small
   value of the aggregation parameter k, but the degree of larval
   overdispersion increased as the mean larval load decreased, invalidating
   the use of a common k, value. A lineal relationship between it and the
   mean (mu) was established, k(mu) = k(1)mu, which permitted exploration
   of the relationship between the observed proportion of infected flies,
   p, and the estimated mean larval bur den per fly, m (all larval stages
   in parous flies). This would allow mean numbers of larvae per parous fly
   to be predicted from presence-absence data (e.g., from infection rates
   provided by polymerase chain reaction methods applied to pools of
   flies), assuming that k(1) is a known parameter. Given that both, and m
   are naturally low in S. ochraceum, their relationship was practically
   linear within the range of observed values. Predictions were tested with
   the Mexican data from which the clumping parameter was estimated as well
   as for Guatemalan data for which this information was not available.
   Results showed a highly satisfactory degree of agreement between
   predictions and observations. The sample sizes required to estimate mean
   larval loads from prevalence data for fixed levels of precision (defined
   as the ratio between SE{[}m] and m) were calculated for realistic S.
   ochraceum infection rates (those found in published pre- and postcontrol
   field surveys as well as in this work). For the special case in which
   the relationship between k and. the mean is linear and goes through the
   origin, k(mu) = k(1)mu, the number of flies to be examined for O.
   volvulus infections does not explicitly depend on the aggregation
   parameter, but rather on the unknown proportion of infected flies.
   Practical recommendations for the calculation of sample sizes are
   discussed. For infection levels <0.2\%, a minimum number between 6,000
   and 13,000 parous flies would have to be examined to estimate the mean
   larval load with a precision between 0.20 and 0.30. The linearity
   between onchocercal infection rare and infection intensity in the fly
   population indicates that relationships between the former and
   onchocerciasis patterns in the human population should be further
   explored. for the purposes of monitoring the impact of ivermectin
   control programs through entomological evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the diameter of the nucleolus of the dorsal pharyngeal gland
   (DPGN) in unhatched second-stage juveniles (J2) of potato cyst
   nematodes, Globodera spp., were monitored for cysts recovered during two
   field experiments in the Bolivian Central Andes. In the first
   experiment, cysts were extracted from soil left fallow or supporting
   crops of potato, barley, lupin, or quinoa. The highest mean DPGN
   diameter for unhatched J2 occurred shortly after planting in January.
   The values were similar for individuals recovered from cysts associated
   with all cultivations. For cysts from potato plots, the lowest mean DPGN
   diameter of 2.26 +/- 0.05 mu m occurred in March, but the value
   increased again by May to 2.53 +/- 0.05 mu m. Similar seasonal changes
   were found for J2 under both nonhost crops and fallow with the smallest
   diameters recorded in May of 2.48 +/- 0.05 mu m and 2.34 +/- 0.05 mu m,
   respectively. Two possible factors might cause this significant seasonal
   change. First, some J2 may hatch early in the growing season, even in
   the absence of the host. This would enhance the proportion of dormant,
   unhatched J2 remaining in the cyst samples. Secondly, a seasonal change
   in the DPGN diameter may occur for most individuals with a transient
   fall value between January and March/May. A model defined by this study
   provides a good description of the observed effect, providing both
   factors are assumed to occur. The second experiment studied if changes
   in size of DPGN in response to a hatching stimulus are influenced by the
   cyst population age. The DPGN in unhatched J2 was measured for cysts
   recovered from soils that had supported potatoes that growing season or
   2 or 4 pears earlier. The unhatched J2 from the freshly cropped potato
   site showed the largest mean DPGN diameter of 3.66 +/- 0.05 mu m after 7
   days in potato root diffusate, whereas those from the 4-year sample had
   the smallest value of 3.20 +/- 0.05 mu m. This significant difference
   may indicate a delayed response to the hatching stimulus with more
   prolonged J2 dormancy.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of a sparse population of rabbits on 100 ha of flats beside
   the Orongorongo River were studied for 21 years. Distribution of rabbit
   sign and plant cover were measured annually over the whole study area.
   The rabbits on 40 ha were counted monthly and live-trapped for 10 years.
   The abundance of predators (cats and stoats) was monitored by the
   frequency of sightings, and their diet from seats. Rabbits had no
   warrens, but hid in the scrub by day and bred in stops. The amount of
   rabbit sign was correlated with their numbers and food supply. Floods
   reduced plant cover but opened new ground for palatable herbs. Without
   floods, shrubs replaced herbs and rabbits decreased. Adult male rabbits
   were in good condition and long lived. Adult females were in poor
   condition, produced rather few young, and did not live as long as males.
   Many young died in the nest or were killed by cats soon after they
   emerged. Cats also killed adult rabbits. Population regulation probably
   involved both extrinsic and intrinsic factors: predators and food
   shortage reduced the number of juveniles to a level at which
   territoriality imposed effective control.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of ungulates on small mammals in an East African savanna
   habitat were investigated by monitoring the population and community
   responses of small mammals on replicated 4-ha plots from which ungulates
   had been excluded. The dominant small mammal in this habitat is the
   pouched mouse, Saccostomus mearnsi, a medium-sized murid rodent. Eight
   other small mammal species, including Arvicanthis sp., Mus sp., Mastomys
   sp., Dendromus sp., Crocidura sp., and, rarely, Tatera sp., Aethomys
   sp., and Acomys sp., were also captured. The dominant ungulates are
   elephant (Loxodonta africana), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), Grevy's
   and common zebra (Equus grevyi and E. burchelli), buffalo (Syncerus
   cafer), eland (Taurotragus oryx), Grant's gazelle (Gazella granti), and
   domestic cattle. Within 1 year, S. mearnsi populations had responded
   dramatically to the exclusion of large mammals by a two-fold increase in
   density, a difference that was maintained through pronounced seasonal
   fluctuations in the second year. Though individual pouched mice showed
   no significant differences in their use of space with and without
   ungulates, male S. mearnsi maintained significantly higher body weights
   in the absence of ungulates, indicating that habitat quality had
   increased. One other species, Mastomys sp., also increase, in the
   absence of ungulates. Overall, the small mammal community maintained
   relatively constant species diversity on the plots to which ungulates
   did not have access. On the plots to which ungulates did have access, on
   the other hand, there was a rapid 75\% decrease in diversity in the
   control plots during one trapping session. Ungulates are most likely
   affecting small mammals through their effects on food quality, since
   there were no detectable differences in their exposure to predators, as
   determined by vegetative cover, in the absence of ungulates. These
   results demonstrate that ungulates call have strong and rapid impacts on
   small mammal abundance and diversity in East African savannas, an
   interaction which has not previously been given serious consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies of post-dispersal seed predation have focused on density
   and distance dependent mortality, while relatively few have examined the
   fates of isolated seeds. Yet, scatter-dispersed seeds (sensu Howe) are
   commonly deposited singly or in small groups. Furthermore, even in
   species with highly aggregated seed distributions, the fates of the most
   widely dispersed individuals may be critical for recruitment. We
   compared predation rates on single, isolated seeds, among 40 species of
   trees in lowland tropical rain forest at Gunung Palung, West Kalimantan,
   Indonesia. Seeds were placed along four replicate transects and
   monitored for damage by predators, removal and germination in four
   trials, each lasting at least 30 days. Tethering of seeds did not affect
   removal rates, indicating that removals were attributable to seed
   predators and not merely to physical disturbance by animals or abiotic
   factors. After 30 days, mortality due to seed predation, averaged over
   species, was more than 50\%; among species, predation losses ranged from
   0 to 100\%. Over the range of seed sizes we examined (0.1 g to 11.6 g
   fresh weight) predation rates were negatively associated with seed size
   and with the thickness and hardness;of the seed coat. Lower predation on
   larger seeds is contrary to theoretical predictions and some prior
   empirical finding, and may be partially explained by the scarcity of
   predators capable of penetrating the physical defenses of large seeds
   with hard seed coats. Large, soft seeds with low predation rates may
   have poor nutrition or may be protected by chemical defenses. Species
   differed greatly in 30-day germination rates, ranging from 0 to 47\%.
   Some species with low predation rates also had low germination rates;
   the implications for the overall risk of predation during the seed stage
   are discussed. Predation rates were not associated with species' natural
   dispersal mode (clumped vs scatter-dispersed), contrary to theoretical
   predictions. Spiny rats (Maxomys spp.) were the most abundant seed
   eating rodent. Caged spiny rats avoided large, hard seeds and preferred
   soft, medium sized seeds. The substantial rates of post dispersal
   predation on isolated seeds that we measured may be sufficient to
   influence strongly the population dynamics and life history evolution of
   trees in this rain forest community.}},

Abstract = {{Invasion by exotic plant species has become a global concern. Although
   some work has been done on the effect of plant invasions on community
   properties, such as the diversity and composition of animal populations,
   little is known about the impacts of introduced plants on ecosystem
   functions such as litter decomposition. We explored the influence of
   introduced plants on the process of decomposition by comparing the
   decomposition of senescent leaves from introduced and native plants. Two
   introduced species, Eucalyptus globulus (Labill) and Acacia longifolia
   (Andrews) Willd, and two native species, Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner
   and Populus nigra (L.) were studied. Changes in litter mass,
   concentrations of polyphenols and nitrogen, and fungal biomass were
   monitored over a period of 16.5 months. In all species, polyphenolic
   content decreased with time. Alder was the only leaf type that released
   N from the beginning of the experiment. Fungal and arthropod
   colonization of the litter of all species followed leaching and
   stabilization of polyphenol content. Fungal colonization differed
   significantly among leaf species. Alnus leaves decomposed at the highest
   rate (k = -0.908/year), followed by Eucalyptus (k = -0.808/year); Acacia
   (k = -0.468/year) and Populus (k = -0.393/year). Decomposition rates and
   associated processes were independent of the geographical origin of the
   species and were better explained in terms of physicochemical
   characteristics of the leaves.}},

Abstract = {{An indirect immunofluorescent technique was developed to localize
   tobacco ringspot nepovirus (TRSV) in the vector nematode Xiphinema
   americanum sensu stricto. A population of this nematode that efficiently
   transmitted TRSV was given an acquisition access period of 10 days on
   TRSV-infected cucumber. Treatment of fragments of viruliferous nematodes
   with a polyclonal antiserum against TRSV followed by fluorescein
   isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G resulted in
   virus-specific bright fluorescence only in the lumen of the styler
   extension and esophagus. Virus-specific fluorescent signals were
   observed in the virus-retention region of 44\% of the nematode fragments
   examined. The percentage of nematodes labeled with virus-specific
   fluorescence increased as the acquisition access period increased from 0
   to 22 days; the increase paralleled the increase in the transmission
   efficiency of the nematode population. Visualization of the entire
   virus-retention region of individual nematodes within a population of
   vector or nonvector nematodes provides a rapid and simple means of
   monitoring specific attachment of plant viruses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper suggests ways forward from the widely perceived present
   failures of fishery assessment and management. A history of fishery
   yield modelling is presented from the carefree days of the 1950s to the
   depressing series of stock collapses and depletions of the 1980s.
   Underlying this gruesome story has been the failure of management by
   quotas to arrest overcapacity in fishing power, the lack of robust and
   informative reference points and the inadequacy of methods dealing with
   some multispecies fisheries. The paper refines the use of the concept of
   F(ext), defined as the minimum value of F in a self-regenerating yield
   model that leads to eventual extinction in a family of yield curves
   generated with a range of stock recruitment curves. Model
   reconstructions for North Sea cod and Icelandic herring make evident
   calamitous losses in catches forgone as result of the failure of
   rational management. An optimistic agenda that may achieve more
   effective fishery management in the future is presented. In some ways,
   we may have been trying to be too clever. A simple management system
   based on careful monitoring of fishing effort, biological targets such
   as F(95), and exploitation of a diversity of fish resources may suffice
   to avert further disaster and hedge against uncertainty.}},

   is the most plausible function of tree marking. Nowadays, the situation
   with communication systems of brown bear and some other mammals is
   mainly determined by the results of human activity (road network,
   glades, paths, patchiness of the territory). The intensity of tree
   marking may reflect the degree of anthropogenic influence on the brown
   bear population and its living conditions. Differences in the number of
   bear trees (per 10 km of census route) reflect differences in the
   density of the brown bear population. In monitoring, bear trees may be
   used as a source of important information about the state of the brown

Abstract = {{Opuntia spinosissima (Martyn) Mill. (Cactaceae) is an extremely rare
   taxon with a single remaining wild population of 13 plants located on
   Little Torch Key, Florida. The plants rarely set viable seeds and most
   ovaries abscise without initiation of fruits. Pollination and breeding
   system were examined in Little Torch Key and in plant accessions located
   at Fairchild Tropical Garden. Four pollination treatments were carried
   out to test for apomixis, self-pollination, outcrossing, and autogamy; a
   control treatment was also monitored. Additionally, pollen viability,
   pollinators, and seed set and viability were investigated. On selfed,
   crossed, and open (control) stigmas pollen grains germinated, but the
   tubes usually did not reach the base of the style. This suggests that O.
   spinosissima has pre-zygotic self-incompatibility. None of the pairwise
   crosses set seed, so the extant plants were apparently not
   inter-compatible. Out of 173 manipulated and control flowers, only one
   set fruit. Although this flower was outcrossed, no pollen tubes
   germinated on the stigma; this suggests agamospermy, a process common in
   the Cactaceae. In those flowers where pollen tubes did reach the ovary
   they failed to penetrate ovules. suggesting ovarian inhibition or that
   this taxon has lost the ability to be fertilized. Most field-collected
   seeds were viable, but there is no seedling recruitment under natural
   conditions, and vegetative reproduction is common. Based on these
   findings, I hypothesize that O. spin osissima is a sterile polyploid and
   that the 13 extant plants are asexually derived from a single lineage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper relates use of the marine habitat by Aonyx capensis, as shown
   by the use of resting and sprainting sites, to the presence or absence
   of fresh water. This paper tests the null hypothesis that spraints and
   couches of A. capensis are randomly distributed with regard to
   freshwater availability. Dependence on freshwater sources by coastal A.
   capensis has important conservation implications. Reduced stream flow or
   seasonal drying up of sources, resulting from increased human
   activities, can negatively affect continued otter occurrence along a
   coastline. Occurrence of spraints, couches and resting places along the
   south-west coast, South Africa, was found to be closely tied to
   freshwater sources. It is hypothesised from the results of this study
   that A. capensis, like the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, needs fresh water
   to use marine habitats. The results indicate that monitoring freshwater
   points along similar coasts would indicate whether otters were present
   in the general area or not - a time-saving method of determining otter
   distribution on a large scale. Monitoring only mouths of rivers is
   possible, as most spraints and couches were located very close to fresh
   water.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of a series of studies on aspects of the
   persistence of the tropical pasture legume Chamaecrista rotundifolia
   (round-leafed cassia) cv. Wynn. The results are contributing to
   formulating a quantitative model of cassia persistence.
   The main study, at Samford in coastal southeast Queensland, was on the
   fate of cassia seed broadcast into cassia-free pastures in 1900 and 1991
   to simulate seed set in an established cassia pasture. The study was
   carried out on a heavily defoliated and a lightly defoliated site.
   Seedling emergence and soil seed reserves were monitored for 3 (1991
   sawing) or 4 (1990 sowing) years. There was a much higher recovery of
   viable over-sown seed as seedlings or soil seed in the second (50\%)
   than in the first (13\%) sowing. Approximately 40\% of the second sowing
   was recovered as soil seed after 3 years compared with 6\% from the
   first sowing. The difference is attributed to poorer quality of the 1990
   seed sample. The rundown of seed banks was similar under both
   defoliation intensities, but there was greater loss of seed and fewer
   seeds recovered as seedlings on the tightly defoliated site.
   Other studies showed that: in early autumn at Samford, a cassia flower
   bud could develop into a mature pod and dehisce in 39 days, but a longer
   time was required in late autumn; there was a linear relationship
   between herbage yield and seed set but, for the same cassia presentation
   yield, ungrazed pasture set more seed than grazed pasture; seed quality
   of cassia varied between sites and years of collection, with quality
   lower in years with wet conditions during pod set; there was little
   predation of cassia seed placed on the soil surface at Samford, whereas,
   at Narayen Research Station in subcoastal southern Queensland, there was
   considerable predation during the hotter months; and hard seed breakdown
   of cassia occurred at lower temperatures than is the case for some
   Stylosanthes spp. Equations were developed which relate rooting depth of
   cassia seedlings and plants, and age of plants, to taproot diameter. The
   implications of these measurements for management of cassia pastures and
   for development of a model of cassia persistence are discussed.
   Further quantification of factors affecting seed set and the fate of
   seed will be required before a model of cassia persistence can be
   developed that will be reliably applicable to all time/site situations.}},

Abstract = {{In spring 1994, the Intermountain Research Station (now Rocky Mountain
   Research Station), Boise National Forest, and Region 4 of the Forest
   Service initiated long-term studies on bird responses to different fire
   conditions in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests of southwestern Idaho.
   The first phase of the project is to evaluate effects of high-intensity
   wildfire on cavity-nesting bi rds and their associated habitats. During
   spring/summer 1994-1996 we monitored 695 nests of nine cavity-nesting
   bird species (including three Forest Service Sensitive Species:
   Black-backed, White-headed, and Lewis' woodpeckers) and measured
   vegetation at nest sites and at 90 randomly located sites. The burned
   forests used for study areas were created in 1992 and 1994 by primarily
   high-intensity wildfire, thus most standing trees were snags. Nests and
   vegetation were monitored in three treatments: standard-cut salvage
   logged, wildlife-prescription salvage logged, and unlogged controls.
   Tree densities for small diameter trees (>23 cm to less than or equal to
   53 cm {[}>9{''} to less than or equal to 20{''}] diameter breast height
   {[}dbh]) in the unlogged units averaged 81 snags per ha (33 per acre)
   and for larger trees (>53 cm dbh {[}>20{''}]) averaged 17 snags per ha
   (7 per acre). In salvage-logged units about 50\% of the trees were
   harvested, tree densities for small trees averaged 43 snags per ha (17
   per acre) and for large trees ave raged 5 snags per ha (2 per acre).
   Lewis' Woodpecker was the most abundant (208 nests) and successful
   cavity nester on the 2-4 year-old burns, while Black-backed and
   White-headed woodpeckers were rare (23 nests). Lewis' Woodpecker and
   American Kestrel experienced the highest nesting success in the
   salvage-logged units, whereas Northern Flicker and Hairy Woodpecker were
   most successful in the unlogged units. All bird species selected nest
   sites with higher tree densities than that measured at random sites, and
   cavity nesters as a group selected clumps of snags rather than snags
   that were retained in uniform, evenly-spaced distributions. Among bird
   species, Black-backed Woodpeckers used nest sites with the highest tree
   densities, while Lewis' Woodpeckers selected relatively open nest sites.
   Cavity-nesters as a group selected larger diameter and more heavily
   decayed snags than that expected based on availability of such snags.
   Snags with the highest probability (>85\%) of being classified as nest
   trees were characterized by heavy decay and broken tops that pre-dated
   the wildfire. We discuss management implications of stand-replacement
   fire and post-fire salvage logging for cavity-nesting birds. Future
   plans are outlined, including bird and plant responses to different fire
   conditions (stand-replacement fire, fire suppression, and prescribed
   fire). The intent of this work is to provide information on the action
   and no action alternatives to the Forest Health Initiative.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in weed seedbank composition are often monitored by removing
   seeds from soil samples. One extraction method accomplishes this by
   creating a slurry of soil and a concentrated inorganic salt solution.
   Centrifugation is then used to separate constituents of differing
   densities. We have found that centrifugation of giant foxtail seeds in
   3.2 M potassium carbonate solution as conducted in a
   centrifugation/flotation extraction method can reduce viability as
   measured by germination and tetrazolium tests. In one experiment,
   centrifugation/flotation separation reduced germination of giant foxtail
   seeds from 94 to 52\%. The likely cause of seed damage was the high pH

Abstract = {{Ecological baseline areas are necessary benchmarks to detect slow change
   and predict fast change in ecosystems that humans depend upon. National
   parks, by default, fulfill this role provided they are large enough to
   maintain natural processes. They should be used to understand natural
   regulatory ecosystem processes that are then compared with other
   human-dominated systems. Natural regulation operates through negative
   feedback mechanisms in reproduction or mortality caused by factors such
   as food shortage and predation. Protected areas are capable of
   self-regulation as evidenced by many studies of such ecosystems covering
   several decades. They exhibit natural change, often with periodicities
   of decades or centuries, and such change must be accommodated in
   management plans. Ecosystems exhibit >1 natural state, often as a result
   of top-down processes such as predation and herbivory. These multistates
   are identified by their irreversibility when the cause of perturbations
   is removed. They are characterized by >1 combination of population
   densities and species. Predators may or may not be present, and
   herbivores may or may not impinge on the vegetation. Therefore, there is
   no single combination of species or ecosystem states for which
   management should strive. Naturalness, per se, is not the objective.
   Rather, the fundamental need is to compare ecosystems experiencing
   modern human impact with those in protected areas that are relatively
   free of such impacts so as to understand their consequences for mankind.
   The presence or absence of prehistoric humans is not relevant to these
   objectives. Management, however, should act to minimize disturbances,
   such as the presence of exotic species, within these ecological
   baselines. Monitoring of ecosystem change should be coordinated on a
   global basis, using simple and robust techniques.}},

Abstract = {{I review studies on the effects of mammalian herbivore grazing on plant
   species composition, biomass, productivity, and nitrogen cycling and the
   responses of ungulates to grazing perturbations at 2 sites in the
   northern United States. Vegetation studies involved use of permanent and
   moveable exclosures and comparison of vegetation attributes along
   natural grazing gradients. Animal responses to herbivore-induced
   vegetation changes were monitored by direct observation and by
   measurement of consumption at various sites. At Wind Cave National Park
   (WCNP), South Dakota, heavily grazed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus)
   colonies typically had lower levels of plant biomass, were forb rather
   than grass dominated, and had plants with higher leaf nitrogen (N)
   concentrations than plants growing outside of the colonies. Soils in
   prairie dog colonies had greater rates of net N-mineralization than
   lightly grazed, uncolonized sites. Bison (Bison bison) grazed
   preferentially on prairie dog colonies, grassland patches mowed to
   simulate grazing, urine patches, and recently burned patches, presumedly
   because of higher forage quality in each of these patch types than on
   unaltered grassland. Uncolonized grasslands used by bison and other
   ungulates at WCNP and areas used by wild horses (Equus caballus) at
   Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and the overlapping Pryer
   Mountain Wild Horse Range in Montana and Wyoming showed no consistent
   differences in plant species composition or in leaf N-concentrations
   compared to vegetation within exclosures. These data suggest that
   ungulates in these parks are managed at levels that are not presently
   degrading the vegetation. Although prairie dogs have had an impact on
   the vegetation in local areas, their colonies provide a significant
   portion of the food bison consume at WCNP. As long as their presence
   does not reduce forage availability for ungulates to a potentially
   critical level, further control of their populations does not appear to
   be warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Predator populations and conflicts of predators with humans have
   steadily increased in the past few decades. Numerous claims have been
   made that lack of trapping has resulted in increases in predator
   populations, but with little documentation. Demonstrating predator
   population increases is difficult, but necessary, if management of
   predators is to be justified to the public. Since 1980 the Mississippi
   Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks has conducted a statewide
   hunter survey. Information from the survey has been used in gathering
   statewide game harvest estimates and may be useful for monitoring
   population trends. Based on this survey, coyotes have experienced a
   7.5-fold increase since 1980, while bobcat (Lynx rufus) and red fox
   (Vulpes vulpes) and gray fox (Urocyon cineroargenteus) populations have
   changed little during 1980-1995. Releases of coyotes (Canis latrans) by
   man and extirpation of native predators in the Southeast may be
   responsible for range expansion of coyotes.}},

Title = {{An evaluation of strip-transect aerial survey methods for monitoring

Journal = {{WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{561-570}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{We evaluated the use of replicated strip-transect aerial surveys to
   estimate population size of manatees (Trichechus manatus) in the Banana
   River, Florida, an important warm-season refuge for this species. Our
   objectives were (1) to estimate population size of manatees, (2) to
   correct for perception bias by applying a Petersen mark-recapture model
   to counts made by 2 independent observers, and (3) to evaluate the
   usefulness of these surveys in detecting population trends over time.
   Five hundred thirty-one individuals comprising 248 manatee groups were
   counted in 15 replicate surveys during August-September 1993 and August
   1994. Survey-specific correction factors for perception bias (the
   proportion of manatees visible within the strip transect but missed by
   observers) averaged 1.12. Annual population estimates derived from strip
   transects were 125 +/- 4 ((x) over bar +/- SE) and 179 +/- 8 in 1993 and
   1994, respectively. We added counts made in a high-density stratum
   (i.e., manatee aggregation sites) to obtain corrected population
   estimates of 159 +/- 7 and 238 +/- 10 in 1993 and 1994, respectively.
   Given the high precision of our annual estimates (CV less than or equal
   to 0.05), we could use this survey protocol to detect a 5\% annual rate
   of change in <4 years with power greater than or equal to 0.75. Our
   study is the first to use replicated strip-transect aerial surveys to
   estimate manatee population size. This survey technique is an
   improvement over previous attempts to estimate manatee abundance,
   because it uses a repeatable, standardized survey design to produce
   population estimates with associated variance and confidence intervals.
   We recommend that managers use warm-season strip-transect surveys in the
   Banana River to corroborate other evidence of population trends of
   manatees on the east coast of Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Historical records of population numbers are almost entirely lacking for
   shorebirds and some species of waterfowl breeding in the Nearctic. In
   1975 and 1976, ground surveys of breeding birds were undertaken in the
   Rasmussen Lowlands, Northwest Territories. We carried out similar
   censuses in the same area during the summers of 1994 and 1995. Weather
   conditions and methods were very similar during the two sets of surveys.
   For all years, we compared densities in different habitat types, as well
   as estimates for the entire region of total numbers of breeding Red
   Phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicaria), Pectoral Sandpipers, (Calidris
   melanotos), White-rumped Sandpipers (C. fuscicollis), Semipalmated
   Sandpipers (C. pusilla), Black-bellied Plovers (Pluvialis squatarola),
   American Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis dominica), Dunlin (C. alpina),
   Baird's Sandpipers (C. bairdii), and King Elders (Somateria
   spectabilis). We found that breeding populations of Red Phalaropes,
   Black-bellied Plovers, American Golden-Plovers, and King Elders in the
   1990s had decreased substantially (76-87\%) from their numbers in the
   1970s. Numbers of other shorebird species did not decrease significantly
   (17-48\%). Numbers of Black-bellied Plovers have apparently decreased at
   staging sites on the east coast of the United States and Canada.
   However, for American Golden-Plovers, there is no evidence of a decline
   on the east coast or in at least one other area in the eastern Nearctic.
   No other population information exists for Red Phalaropes breeding in
   the eastern Nearctic, Elder numbers appear to be decreasing throughout
   the Arctic. Possible reasons for declines are habitat changes in
   migratory staging sites and southern wintering areas. We need more
   consistent monitoring of arctic shorebirds in order to identify species
   with continual population declines. Further studies should emphasize
   Nearctic populations of species showing substantial declines in this
   study, examining consistency of decreases throughout the Nearctic, and
   reasons for such changes.}},

Abstract = {{Lux-marked strains of a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain effective as
   biological control agent were analyzed for survival ability on the
   phylloplane of bean plants under growth chamber conditions. The
   persistence of the genetically engineered bacteria was monitored by
   bioluminescence detection syst ems as well as by conventional serial
   dilution and plating methods. The lux-mutants were able to establish
   large populations on wet bean leaves, comparable with the wild-type
   strain. None of them had lost the bioluminescence and the ability to
   grow on selective media during phylloplane colonization. One of the
   lux-mutants tested exhibit ed significantly higher light production
   relative to the other lux-mutants during 12 days on bean plants.
   Bioluminescence proved to be an innocuous mutation and a sensitive
   detection method for further studies on population dynamics and
   behaviour under various conditions during bacterial colonization of
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular markers can be used for determining BNA-polymorphisms among
   populations of phytopathogenic Fungi. We have characterized 22 single
   spore isolates of Septoria tritici from different locations (30 km apart
   from each other) in North Germany by different marker systems. On the
   average, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers cloned
   from single copy or repetitive DNA yielded 2.4 and 5.8 polymorphic
   bands, respectively. For each primer combination, random amplified
   polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers gave 6.3 and amplified fragment length
   polymorphism (AFLP) markers 36.3 polymorphic bands, respectively.
   Between the groups of isolates, similarities ranged from 0.38 to 0.23
   for RFLPs, 0.43 to 0.25 for AFLPs, and 0.35 to 0.15 for RAPDs,
   respectively. However, clustering was apparent For isolates sampled from
   the same location. For monitoring S. tritici infection in the field, the
   AFLP marker technique proved to be most powerful due to its high
   polymorphism rate.}},

Abstract = {{We used a demographic model to calculate a series of annual N-e/N
   estimates ((Ne/N)(S)) for a population of the endangered San Joaquin kit
   fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) and to identify the demographic parameters
   explaining significant portions of the variation in (N-e/N)(S)
   estimates. Demographic data were collected between 1981 and 1995 from
   adult kit foxes located on the Naval Petroleum Reserves in California.
   Demographic parameters were estimated by determining the sex of captured
   adult foxes and monitoring the survival and reproduction of adult foxes
   fitted with radiocollars. Individual demographic parameters explaining
   significant portions (P < 0.10) of the variation in (N-e/N)(S) estimates
   was determined using forward stepwise multiple regression. Estimates of
   ((Ne/N)(S) were highly variable, ranging from 0.22 to 1.15, (<(x)over
   bar> = 0.67, SEM = 0.07, n = 14), with a harmonic mean of 0.55. Forward
   stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that mean annual female
   survival ( P = 0.002) and mean annual female reproductive success (P =
   0.004) explained significant portions of the variation in estimates of
   (N-e/N)(S), while mean annual sex ratio (P = 0.159), mean annual litter
   size (P = 0.406) and mean annual male survival (P = 0.922) did not.
   Long-term kit fox conservation strategies will probably have to account
   for wide variation in (N-e/N)(S) ratios and focus on maintaining or
   expanding the size and connectivity of populations.}},

Abstract = {{A 5-yr ongoing demographic study of the extremely localized (ca. 0.5
   ha), rare, high-alpine endemic Myosotis oreophila and the widespread M.
   pulvinaris, where their ranges overlap, has revealed widely fluctuating
   populations in both species. Three representative permanent study plots
   totaling 290 m(2) (6.4\% of the total population area) were located near
   the center and on the margins of the M. oreophila population. High
   turnover rates have been confirmed by the loss of 1476 plants of M.
   oreophila and the recruitment of 1600 in the sample population over 5
   yr. Three years of good recruitment and one of high mortality indicate
   that the total population of M. oreophila has varied by ca. 40\%, from a
   maximum of ca. 21,800 to a minimum of ca. 13,000 plants over the 5-yr
   period. Thus it can be assumed that the whole population has essentially
   turned over in the 5-yr study period. The possible role of differential
   distribution of snowlie and/or snowmelt in this exposed high-alpine
   environment is being examined with experimental snow fences within and
   just beyond the limits of the M. oreophila population but monitoring of
   plant responses over the first 3 yr is inconclusive.
   The partially overlapping, but inversely related, distributions and
   density patterns of the leafy M. oreophila and cushion-forming M.
   pulvinaris have revealed similar demographic patterns and give no
   indication that either species is changing its status (i.e. advancing or
   reheating) along their respective margins. We tentatively endorse the
   rare status currently assigned to M. oreophila since the population,
   although extremely local, appears capable of maintaining itself despite
   a surprisingly rapid turnover of individual plants and the total
   population in a habitat where longevity of most of the high-alpine flora

Abstract = {{Pelagic fisheries account for 83\% of the total number of fish landed
   into Irish ports, with mackerel Scomber scrombrus, horse-mackerel
   Trachurus trachurus and herring Clupea harengus constituting 97\% of
   this. Despite the importance of pelagic fish species, there is little
   published information on discarding practices for most Irish trawl
   fisheries and no study of marine mammal by-catch. Fisheries scientists
   accompanied commercial trawlers fishing herring in the Celtic Sea during
   the 1994/5 season. During the study, 85 days were spent at sea, with 78
   tows monitored, amounting to 101h of fishing effort, which was 7\% of
   the total effort in the fishery. Most fishing was carried out in
   International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions
   VIIg01, VIIg02 and VIIa20, and most fish were caught in VIIS01 and
   VIIa20. The fishery was very selective, with 99.5\% of the total weight
   of the catch being the target species. Mean size (+/-SE) of herring
   caught was extremely consistent, ranging from 24.8 +/- 12.7cm in October
   to 26.0 +/- 2.0cm in January. Overall, 1270 tonnes of fish were observed
   being caught, of which 1214 tonnes were landed and 57 tonnes discarded
   (4.7\%). Whiting Merlangius merlangus was the most frequently recorded
   non-target fish species; mackerel and horse-mackerel were also
   frequently caught. Four grey seals Halichoerus grypus were caught during
   the study at a rate of one per 317.5 tonnes of fish or 0.05 seals per
   tow. This catch rate extrapolates to around 60 seals caught in the
   fishery, which is not thought to have a significant impact on the Irish
   seal population.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the first study of the smooth newt in Ireland, a population
   was monitored at a small pond in Dublin over 3 years. Non-destructive
   skeletochronology was used to examine the life history of this animal.
   The investigation has also been the first to monitor the population
   biology of this species and achieve accurate age estimates without the
   need to sacrifice large numbers of animals. Most newts were found to
   mature after four winters on land (4+). However, 20\% of males were
   recorded breeding for the first time as 3+ animals, suggesting that two
   development strategies are open to males: (1) they can mature at 3+
   without the benefits of an additional 1-year's growth on land; or (2)
   they can delay their maturation for 1 year and increase their potential
   annual reproductive output at the loss of 1 year's breeding. The oldest
   animals recorded were 7+, and females predominated in the oldest age
   classes. Annual survivorship was higher in females than males; the
   overall survivorship calculated for the population was 43\%. A
   regression of total length with age proved non-significant, but the
   correlation between weight and age was significant.}},

Abstract = {{In 1991 the population size of the coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) on
   Grande Comore Island, Western Indian Ocean, was estimated at 230-650
   individuals, based on counts of individually recognized fish in an 8-km
   stretch of coastline. This census area represents about 9\% of the total
   suitable habitat at the island. Counts in the same area in 1994
   indicated a reduction of sighted coelacanths of about 30\%. Additional
   surveys in 1995 suggested a total coelacanth population of less than 300
   individuals. The local artisanal fishery is probably responsible for the
   observed decline. The survival of the coelacanth seems to be severely
   threatened if fishing pressure is not reduced. Conservation measures
   should focus on providing local fishermen with fishing alternatives.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},

Abstract = {{The sublethal effects of high predation risk on both prey behavior and
   physiology may have long-term consequences for prey population dynamics.
   We tested the hypothesis that snowshoe hares during the population
   decline are chronically stressed because of high predation risk whereas
   those during the population low are not, and that this has negative
   effects on both their physiology and demography. Snowshoe hares exhibit
   10-yr population cycles; during declines, virtually every hare that dies
   is killed by a predator. We assessed the physiological responsiveness of
   the stress axis and of energy mobilization by subjecting hares during
   the population decline and low to a hormonal-challenge protocol. We
   monitored the population demography through live-trapping and assessed
   reproduction through a maternal-cage technique.
   During the 1990s' decline in the Yukon, Canada, hares were chronically
   stressed-as indicated by higher levels of free cortisol, reduced maximum
   corticosteroid-binding capacity, reduced testosterone response, reduced
   index of body condition, reduced leucocyte counts, increased overwinter
   body-mass loss, and increased glucose mobilization, relative to hares
   during the population low. This evidence is consistent with the
   explanation that predation risk, not high hare density or poor
   nutritional condition, accounted for the chronic stress and for the
   marked deterioration of reproduction during the decline. Reproduction
   and indices of stress physiology did not improve until predation risk
   declined. These findings may also account for the lag in recovery of
   hare reproduction after predator densities have declined and thus may
   implicate the long-term consequences of predation risk on prey
   populations beyond the immediate effects of predators on prey behavior
   and physiology.}},

Abstract = {{To identify the factors responsible for degrading the habitat of the
   endangered plant species Aster kantoensis, as well as the vulnerable
   life stage where this occurs, we carried out sowing experiments. Two
   natural habitats were simulated, being situated along the floodplains of
   the Tama River in central Japan. Seeds collected from a natural habitat
   were sown in two apparently suitable locations (Tomoda and Ishida
   sites). Germination, survival, growth, and seed production were
   subsequently monitored from 1993 through to 1997. The Tomoda site was a
   gravel bar in floodplains formed by flooding in 1991, while the Ishida
   site (two plots) was one gravel bar where several plants were growing
   sparsely and another where a population had become extinct in 1992. Seed
   cohorts completed their life cycle within 3 years at the Ishida site and
   within 5 years at the Tomoda site. Monitored parameters at Ishida were
   substantially lower than those at Tomoda. In addition, estimates of
   population growth indicated an increase at Tomoda and a rapid decrease
   at Ishida. However, degradation of habitats seemed to occur at Tomoda
   over the monitored periods. In view of our results, we conclude that
   natural germination of about 0.13\% is needed for increasing population
   size. The major factors for decreasing population size are believed to
   be the lack of safe sites for germination and seedling establishment in
   old habitats (> 10 years). Conservation measures are suggested based on
   these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Yellow sticky traps are widely used for monitoring and management of
   whiteflies and certain other pests and have also been used to monitor
   their natural enemy activity. A new, nonsticky whitefly trap (CC trap),
   standard yellow sticky cards, and clear colorless sticky cards were
   evaluated in cotton (Gossypium. hirsutum L.) to compare their
   attractiveness to Eretmocerus eremicus Rose and Zolnerowich, an
   aphelinid parasitoid of Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Perring {[}=
   Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) B-strain] that is indigenous to southwestern
   U.S. deserts. The CC traps caught an average of 264 adult whiteflies
   during 24-h test periods compared with 523 adult whiteflies on yellow
   sticky traps. The colorless sticky cards trapped only 37 whiteflies per
   card during the same period. The CC traps caught an average of 0.4 adult
   E, eremicus over a 24-h period compared with 26.6 adult E. eremicus
   trapped by yellow sticky cards. Colorless plastic sticky cards trapped
   an average of 1.1 parasitoids per card, demonstrating that E. eremicus
   was strongly attracted to the yellow sticky cards. Thirty-nine percent
   of E. eremicus trapped on yellow sticky cards and 42\% trapped on
   colorless sticky cards were female. CC traps caught the lowest numbers
   of other arthropods. On average, <1 individual of any other species was
   captured per CC trap in each 24-h period. Yellow sticky traps caught the
   greatest number of other arthropods; these included thrips, flies,
   cotton leafperforator (Buccalatrix thurberiella Busck) moths, small
   beetles, and other parasitic wasps. Clear sticky traps caught a similar
   mixture of species but in lower numbers. These results demonstrate that
   CC traps are highly selective for whitefly, while preserving parasitoid
   populations. CC traps may be especially useful in greenhouses where
   yellow sticky traps are frequently used in conjunction with releases of
   parasitoids.}},

Abstract = {{The fungicide chlorothalonil (TCIN), with both agricultural and
   horticultural applications, is a common aquatic pollutant. The
   immunotoxic potential of TCIN was investigated following a 20-h in vitro
   exposure of striped bass (Morone saxatilus) macrophages to a range of
   sublethal concentrations. Cells from the anterior kidney were separated
   by density-gradient centrifugation to obtain a macrophage-enriched cell
   population. Following TCIN exposure, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   production was evaluated using luminol-augmented chemiluminescence;
   phagocytic capacity was measured by the ingestion of fluorescein
   isothiocyanate-conjugated yeast; and NADPH production was estimated by
   monitoring the reduction of a water-soluble tetrazolium,
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol
   2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner
   salt. Results indicate that TCIN, at concentrations greater than or
   equal to 250 mu g/L, decreased ROS production in both zymosan- and
   phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated cells in a dose-dependent
   manner. The PMA-stimulated NADPH production coincident with the
   respiratory burst was also decreased at concentration greater than or
   equal to 250 mu g/L. The TCIN did not appear to alter phagocytic
   ability. Taken together, these results indicate that the mechanism of
   toxicity affects the activation or function of the NADPH oxidase but not
   the uptake of particles by phagocytosis, and that these effects can
   probably be localized to the signal transduction pathway or the
   assemblage of NADPH oxidase.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand has hosted three Melampsora species attacking poplars
   (Populus spp.), namely, Melampsora larici-populina, Melampsora medusae
   and for a single season, Melampsora medusae-populina, a unique
   interspecific hybrid. The predominant species, M. larici-populina,
   over-winters via larch and each year new races appear causing
   defoliation of previously rust-resistant cultivars. Melampsora medusae
   also occurs in some seasons following over-wintering on certain hosts or
   by aerial transport from Australia. Willows (Salix spp.) host four
   Melampsora species, Melampsora coleosporioides, Melampsora epitea var.
   epitea and two unidentified species attacking Salix viminalis and Salix
   daphnoides/Salix incana x open pollinated hybrids, respectively. The
   host range and pathogenicity of these species have remained static as no
   breakdown in host resistance has been observed. The anthracnose fungi,
   Marssonina brunnea end Marssonina castagnei, on poplar, and
   iCPMarssonina salicicola on tree willows occur throughout New Zealand.
   All three species can cause severe defoliation of susceptible cultivars
   in moist districts where annual rainfall exceeds 1000 mm. Although all
   form abundant microconidia during autumn, the Drepanopeziza states have
   never been observed in New Zealand. During an unusually wet summer
   (1992-93), a new strain of Marssonina salicicola appeared which
   defoliated the previously resistant cultivar, Salix matsudana x Salix
   alba cv. 1002. The importance of monitoring the morphological (conidial
   dimensions, DNA fingerprints) and physiological (host range and
   pathogenicity) attributes of local populations of Melampsora and
   Marssonina species is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In theory, parasites can create time-lagged, frequency-dependent
   selection in their hosts, resulting in oscillatory gene-frequency
   dynamics in both the host and the parasite (the Red Queen hypothesis).
   However, oscillatory dynamics have not been observed in natural
   populations. In the present study, we evaluated the dynamics of asexual
   clones of a New Zealand snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, and its
   trematode parasites over a five-year period. During the summer of each
   year, we determined host-clone frequencies in random samples of the
   snail to track genetic changes in the snail population. Similarly, we
   monitored changes in the parasite population, focusing on the dominant
   parasite, Microphallus sp., by calculating the frequency of clones in
   samples of infected individuals from the same collections. We then
   compared these results to the results of a computer model that was
   designed to examine clone frequency dynamics for various levels of
   parasite virulence. Consistent with these simulations and with ideas
   regarding dynamic coevolution, parasites responded to common clones in a
   time-lagged fashion. Finally, in a laboratory experiment, we found that
   crones that had been rare during the previous five years were
   significantly less infectible by Microphallus when compared to the
   common clones. Taken together, these results confirm that rare host
   genotypes are more likely to escape infection by parasites; they also
   show that host-parasite interactions produce, in a natural population,
   some of the dynamics anticipated by the Red Queen hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Suction dredging for gold in river channels is a small-scale mining
   practice whereby streambed material is sucked up a pipe, passed over a
   sluice box to sort out the gold, and discarded as tailings over another
   area of bed. Natural resource managers should be concerned about suction
   dredging because it is common in streams in western North America that
   contain populations of sensitive aquatic species. It also is subject to
   both state and federal regulations, and has provided the basis for
   litigation. The scientific literature contains few peer-reviewed studies
   of the effects of dredging, but knowledge of dredging practices, and the
   biology and physics of streams suggests a variety of mechanisms linking
   dredging to aquatic resources. Effects of dredging commonly appear to be
   minor and local, but natural resource professionals should expect
   effects to vary widely among stream systems and reaches within systems.
   Fishery managers should be especially concerned when dredging coincides
   with the incubation of embryos in stream gravels or precedes spawning
   runs soon followed by high flows. We recommend that managers carefully
   analyze each watershed so regulations can be tailored to particular
   issues and effects. Such analyses are part of a strategy to (1) evaluate
   interactions between suction dredging and other activities and
   resources; (2) use this information to regulate dredging and other
   activities; (3) monitor implementation of regulations and on- and
   off-site effects of dredging; and (4) adapt management strategies and
   regulations according to new information. Given the current level of
   uncertainty about the effects of dredging, where threatened or
   endangered aquatic species inhabit dredged areas, fisheries managers
   would be prudent to suspect that dredging is harmful to aquatic
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term variations in zooplankton abundance in the north-east
   Atlantic, the North Sea, and in freshwater UK lakes are investigated bq
   means of the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey and the Windermere and
   Esthwaite lakes data. Inter-annual variability of plankton abundance in
   these data sets shows strong correlation with two modes of climatic
   variability in the North Atlantic: the latitudinal shifts of the north
   wall of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Detailed
   analyses reveal that the connection between environmental forcing and
   plankton response depends on various mechanisms, i.e., timing and
   intensity of the spring phytoplankton bloom resulting from changes in
   stratification levels, changes in temperature, and. in the case of the
   copepod Calanus finmarchicus, advection of the population into the North
   Sea at the end of the winter season. Future attempts to predict changes
   in marine ecosystems on the basis of climate scenarios will require
   focusing major effort on biological-physical modelling and large-scale
   plankton population ecology. The maintenance of long-term monitoring
   programmes is also essential to determine whether the climate-plankton
   connections observed during several decades will persist in the future
   or will be overruled by other mechanisms and principally human-induced
   perturbations. (C) 1998 International Council for the Exploration of the

Title = {{Examining threats faced by island birds: a population viability analysis
   on the Capricorn silvereye using longterm data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{1, Population viability analysis (PVA) is widely used for assessing the
   extinction risk faced by endangered species and for evaluating the
   effects of potential management strategies. However, most PVAs are done
   in urgency and with limited data.
   2, It is therefore important to know how the amount and quality of
   available ecological data affect the predictions of PVA. How can PVA
   results be interpreted when we have reliable, long-term population data?
   When a species is endangered on islands, as are many endemic bird
   species, what are the likely causes of the decline, and what is the
   probable impact of new throats? This paper investigates these issues by
   modelling 26 years of monitoring data on the population of Capricorn
   silvereyes Zosterops lateralis chlorocephala Campbell \& White of Heron
   Island on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.
   3. A PVA with parameters estimated from a relatively short (5-year)
   period of data collection produced very different predictions of
   extinction risk compared with a PVA based on more comprehensive
   ecological data spanning 15-25 years. This indicates that caution should
   be exercised when using PVA as an indicator of absolute extinction risk.
   4. Despite remaining viable over the past 26 years, the Heron Island
   silvereye population is predicted to be at risk of extinction within the
   next 100 years, with the magnitude of risk depending on the severity of
   impact of a range of potentially threatening factors. Increased
   mortality due to the introduction of new predators or diseases,
   inbreeding depression or frequent severe storms greatly increased the
   extinction risk. Habitat reduction, if not very severe, is unlikely to
   have a large impact. Similar threats and impacts may apply to other
   island bird populations.
   5. Movement or dispersal between neighbouring islands had a mitigating
   effect on extinction probability and allowed extinct island populations
   to be re-established. However, very small islands could only support
   sink populations that quickly became extinct and required an
   unrealistically high immigration rate to remain viable in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{1 Survival and height growth of permanently tagged understorey seedlings
   in four river floodplain forests in South Carolina were monitored for 8
   years. Regression models were used to determine if a common survival
   pattern emerged and if the pattern varied according to species, spatial
   location, time, seedling size and seedling growth.
   2 For most of the populations, per capita survival was initially poor
   but increased steadily with age. A few populations, however, had
   relatively high survival rates for 1-3 years after establishment, or
   brief periods (1-2 years) with much lower survival. Although the
   underlying survival function was best described by a negative power
   curve, a log-logistic model also fit the data and provided more
   versatility for fitting individual populations.
   3 Significant differences in general survival pattern were found among
   species, sites (forests), years of establishment (cohorts), and all
   two-way interactions of species, site and cohort. Species differences
   were large. Spikes in mortality for individual species and cohorts were
   synchronized within sites and to a lesser degree among sites. In some
   sites, weak relationships were noted between mortality and peak river
   discharge during summer (negatively correlated) and winter (positively
   correlated).
   4 Species differed strongly in their initial height, but effects of
   cohort and site on height were also significant as were all two-way
   interactions of species, site and cohort. During the 8 years of this
   study, very few seedlings grew taller than 30 cm. For most species,
   taller seedlings had greater per capita survival. Height growth,
   however, was not consistently related to survival. Since mean size of
   survivors changed little with time, age may be a better variable than
   size to use in models of survival.
   5 Simulation models could probably be developed using a log-logistic
   function that includes (in order of importance): seedling age, species,
   intensity of winter floods (some sites) and occurrence of summer
   droughts (some sites).}},

Abstract = {{1 The Bibury long-term data set contains information on annual
   fluctuations in the abundance of over 100 grasses and forbs in roadside
   verge vegetation over the period from 1958 to the present. Monitoring
   has been carried out every July by the same individual. The data set
   represents a unique long-term record of the dynamics of a complete plant
   community.
   2 Records for the most abundant taxa (including bare ground and litter)
   were used to determine the effect of climate variability on the
   year-to-year performance of the selected species. Residuals about the
   long-term mean log biomass of each species (detrended where the species
   showed a significant increase or decrease in abundance over time) were
   correlated against indices of interannual climate variability. Plant and
   weather records were compared over 3-month seasonal periods (March-May,
   June-August, September-November, December-February) or 6-month seasonal
   periods (March-August, September-February), with time lags of 0, 1 and 2
   years.
   3 Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to formulate annual
   weather indices, using either conventional weather variables
   (temperature, rainfall and sunshine) or the Lamb catalogue of daily
   weather types.
   4 Between 5\% and 70\% more correlations were observed than might be
   expected to occur by chance, depending on the season and the PCB index,
   indicating markedly non-random plant-weather relationships. Total
   vegetation production was positively correlated with minimum spring
   temperature. The distribution of correlations was generally evenly
   distributed across the three lag periods.
   5 In general, those species favoured by environmental stress or
   disturbance were promoted following warm dry springs and summers,
   whereas those favoured by more productive conditions were promoted
   following a wet growing season.}},

Title = {{Hypericum cumulicola demography in unoccupied and occupied Florida scrub
   patches with different time-since-fire}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1998}},

Abstract = {{1 Metapopulation models predict that unoccupied, but suitable, patches
   will exist for species subject to extinction and colonization dynamics.
   We compared the demographic responses of Hypericum cumulicola, a rare
   herbaceous species almost entirely restricted to Florida rosemary scrub,
   when transplanted to occupied or unoccupied patches.
   2 Seedlings were transplanted and seeds buried into Florida rosemary
   scrub patches differing in time since last lire, and in the presence or
   absence of H. cumulicola. We used a replicated, factorial design to
   place the transplants and seeds in the field, and monitored their
   performance for 18 months.
   3 Neither time-since-fire nor prior H. cumulicola site occupancy
   affected survival of transplants. Only time-since-fire affected growth.
   Time-since-fire, H. cumulicola occupancy, and their interaction affected
   reproductive effort, but these effects were not consistent between
   years.
   4 Flowering and seed production led to subsequent seedling recruitment
   near transplants, mainly in recently burned sites. Genetic screening of
   transplants and seedlings showed that transplants in occupied sites
   could have crossed with nearby resident plants, but that offspring in
   sites previously unoccupied were likely to have been parented only by
   nearby transplants.
   5 Seeds buried, and later exhumed, germinated after 1 or 2 years of
   burial, demonstrating a persistent soil seed bank from which populations
   could recover after fire. Neither time-since-fire nor H. cumulicola
   occupancy affected seed dormancy or germination.
   6 Similar demography in unoccupied and occupied patches suggests that
   the patchy pattern of site occupancy by H. cumulicola is probably due to
   limited dispersal and periodic extinction, especially associated with
   long lire-free intervals. Conservation measures need to protect
   unoccupied patches to allow metapopulation dynamics and persistence.}},

Abstract = {{A field trial comparing the effectiveness of toxic targets impregnated
   with different formulations of the Musca domestica L. female sex
   pheromone (Z)-9-tricosene was conducted in a caged-layer, deep-pit
   poultry unit in southern England. Targets baited with 5 g of technical
   grade (Z)-9-tricosene, or 5 g of a 40\% polymer bead formulation, caught
   significantly greater numbers of M. domestica than control targets. This
   increase in attractiveness of the pheromone-impregnated targets
   persisted for at least 24 wk. However, mean daily catch rates of M,
   domestica at targets baited with 5 g of a 2\% wettable powder
   formulation did not significantly differ from control levels. Technical
   grade and bead formulations of the pheromone attracted significantly
   more males than females. However, the catches of female M. domestica at
   these pheromone-impregnated targets were significantly greater than
   female catches at control targets. Monitoring with sticky cards
   indicated that the introduction of toxic targets successfully suppressed
   adult M. domestica population density for up to 13 wk. Possible
   hypotheses explaining the effect of (Z)-9-tricosene on female attraction
   are discussed.}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{692-712}},

Abstract = {{Four populations of red howling monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) in
   different states of population growth were studied to examine how
   changes in intrasexual competition and kin availability influence mating
   patterns and population genetic structure. The demography of each
   population was monitored for 5 years. Genetic variance within and
   between groups and coefficients of relatedness ((r) over bar) were
   estimated from allozyme loci. Advantages of cooperating with kin over
   non-kin changed with different demographic circumstances for each sex,
   such that social groups were more likely to be kin groups when
   population density was approaching or at carrying capacity than when it
   was low. In populations growing rapidly through new social group
   formation, genetic differentiation between groups was low. Genetic
   differentiation increased as populations approached carrying capacity
   and groups matured socially (i.e., (r) over bar increased). That trend
   was reversed as (r) over bar within group breeding subsets (males and
   females, respectively) increased, thereby decreasing (r) over bar
   between males and females and reducing group (r) over bar. This was
   enhanced when inbreeding within groups was followed by transfer of pods
   of related males, which occurred in a saturated habitat and in a
   declining population experiencing high mortality of adult females.
   Heterozygosity within groups in excess of predicted values was increased
   due to Lineage effects as groups matured and as (r) over bar within
   breeding subsets increased. It also increased when population growth
   occurred through immigration from genetically differentiated demes, and
   when groups fused during population decline. There were large intergroup
   differences in mortality during population decline, which was
   accompanied by social instability that resulted in increased intergroup
   transfer of both sexes, thereby resorting survivors throughout remaining
   breeding groups. Conditions favoring intergroup selection thus decreased
   during periods of population growth when selection was relaxed and group
   (r) over bar was low, increased during periods of stasis when habitats
   were saturated and group (r) over bar was highest, and were most
   prominent during periods of population decline when differences in group
   fitness should have the most pronounced consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Tadpoles of different species of frogs and toads display different
   tendencies to aggregate. We investigated some of the costs and benefits
   of aggregating in three British species by examining their behavioural
   responses to the presence of conspecifics, and by monitoring the
   performance of tadpoles under different levels of social interaction
   with other individuals. The common toad (Bufo bufo), an aggregating
   species, displayed higher levels of activity than the natterjack toad
   (B. calamita) and common frog (Rana temporaria), two species that form
   aggregations less frequently. Moreover, out of the three species, only
   B. bufo increased activity in the presence of conspecifics. In all three
   species, increased interaction between individuals resulted in increased
   variation in size. However, average growth rate was affected only in B.
   bufo, which grew faster when raised in isolation and not interacting
   with other individuals. Under certain conditions intraspecific
   competition therefore seems to tie more important than social
   facilitation, but may lead to average size at metamorphosis being larger
   within the population. The consequences of intraspecific competition
   within aggregations mag therefore be different for individuals and
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to detect population bottlenecks in threatened and
   managed species because bottlenecks can increase the risk of population
   extinction. Early detection is critical and can be facilitated by
   statistically powerful monitoring programs for detecting
   bottleneck-induced genetic change. We used Monte Carlo computer
   simulations to evaluate the power of the following tests for detecting
   genetic changes caused by a severe reduction in a population's effective
   size (N(e)): a test for loss of heterozygosity, two tests for loss of
   alleles, two tests for change in the distribution of allele frequencies,
   and a test for small N(e) based on variance in allele frequencies (the
   `variance test'). The variance test was most powerful; it provided an
   85\% probability of detecting a bottleneck of size N(e) = 10 when
   monitoring five microsatellite loci and sampling 30 individuals both
   before and one generation after the bottleneck. The variance test was
   almost 10-times more powerful than a commonly used test for loss of
   heterozygosity, and it allowed for detection of bottlenecks before 5\%
   of a population's heterozygosity had been lost. The second most powerful
   tests were generally the tests for loss of alleles. However, these tests
   had reduced power for detecting genetic bottlenecks caused by skewed sex
   ratios. We provide guidelines for the number of loci and individuals
   needed to achieve high-power tests when monitoring via the variance
   test. We also illustrate how the variance test performs when monitoring
   loci that have widely different allele frequency distributions as
   observed in five wild populations of mountain sheep (Ovis canadensis).}},

Abstract = {{A number of fleshy-fruit-bearing plants of temperate regions are
   dispersed by migratory frugivorous birds. It has been suggested that the
   more southerly populations of such species should produce ripe fruits
   later than more northerly populations, to ensure that fruit is available
   when the birds arrive. I will call this the `adaptive delay' hypothesis.
   To test this hypothesis, I monitored fruiting phenology of Crataegus
   monogyna Jacq. at ten sites (in all of which fruit consumption is very
   largely by redwings, Turdus iliacus, and fieldfares, Turdus pilaris)
   between northern Spain (42 degrees N) and northern Scotland (59 degrees
   N). There was no negative correlation between latitude and date of fruit
   ripening (earliest recorded date on which ripe fruits had appeared, or
   earliest recorded date by which all fruits had ripened). My results thus
   argue against the adaptive delay hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria can be
   detected in living plant cells after transient transformation of
   protoplasts. Expression of the GFP can be used to monitor protein
   trafficking in a mixed cell population and also to study the different
   function and importance of organelles in different cell types. We
   developed a vacuolar form of GFP that was obtained by replacing the
   C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retention moth of mGFP5-ER by the
   vacuolar targeting peptide of tobacco chitinase A. The vacuolar GFP was
   transported and accumulated in the vacuole as expected. However, we
   found two patterns of GFP accumulation after prolonged incubation (18-24
   h) depending on the cell type. Most chloroplast-rich protoplasts had a
   fluorescent large central vacuole. In contrast, most chloroplast-poor
   protoplasts accumulated the GFP in one smaller vacuole but not in the
   large central vacuole, which was visible under a light microscope in the
   same cell. This differential accumulation reflected the existence of two
   different vacuolar compartments as described recently by
   immunolocalization of several vacuolar markers. We were able to
   characterize the vacuolar compartment to which GFP is specifically
   targeted as non-acidic, since it did not accumulate neutral red while
   acidic vacuoles did not accumulate GFP.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of the autonomous maize transposable element En/Spm of
   maize was studied in Arabidopsis. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying
   En-1 elements were propagated for 12 generations using a single seed
   descent procedure. The distribution and activity of the En-1 element was
   monitored using Southern DNA hybridisations in generations 1, 6 and 12.
   In the first generation the highest number of En-1 insertions per line
   was 7, which increased to 20 in generation 12. The average number of
   En-1 insertions increased only slightly in the population, due to a
   gradual accumulation of segregants that lost the transposable element.
   During the development of the En-1 mutagenised population the element
   remained active even in the high-copy lines. In situ hybridisation
   demonstrated that multiple En-1 insertions were distributed over all
   Arabidopsis chromosomes. From the initial En-1 mutagenised populations
   many unstable gene mutations were recovered, indicating that En-1 can be
   used as a efficient tool for gene tagging in Arabidopsis.}},

Abstract = {{Pilot scale GAC columns (1 m x 140 mm i.d.) were fed ozonated river
   water containing atrazine at concentrations of 0.5, 10 or 20 mu g l(-1).
   Columns were inoculated with an atrazine degrading bacterium Rhodococcus
   rhodochrous strain SL1. At the start of the experiment, gradual
   introduction of SL1 into the GAC column over a period of 30 min improved
   retention of inoculant, compared to rapid (< 10 s) injection. Influent
   and effluent atrazine and atrazine adsorbed to GAC were measured and
   populations of SL1 and indigenous bacteria associated with the GAC were
   monitored for 467 d. Inoculation extended ``bed life{''} (i.e. defined
   as the time before ``breakthrough{''} of atrazine in the effluent
   consistently exceeded the EU maximum admissible concentration of 100 ng
   l(-1)) by a minimum of 41 calendar days or 39 operational days (an
   increase of 14.5\% dr 20.5\% over non-inoculated columns). A definition
   which considers the first time breakthrough occurs as significant, gives
   equivalent figures of 40.2\% or 81.7\%. The effect of inoculation on
   reducing effluent atrazine concentration was greatest in the first 232 d
   of the experiment but was recorded until day 351, by which time an
   indigenous atrazine degrading population had become established in the
   non-inoculated columns. SL1 competed well against indigenous bacteria,
   however periodic reinoculation was required to maintain numbers above
   the threshold level (> 1 x 10(5) g(-1) GAG). Significantly, the pilot
   plant was subject to a series of disruptions and shutdowns throughout
   the experiment, but the resilience of the bioregeneration method was
   demonstrated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Population densities of the green stink bug, Plautia affinis, on canes
   of raspberry, Rubus idaeus, were examined at Caboolture, south-eastern
   Queensland, Australia, during 1994-1995. The presence of natural enemies
   of P. affinis was also monitored. When feeding directly on developing
   and mature fruit, both adult and nymphal P. affinis cause damage.
   Numbers +/- SE of P. affinis peaked at 1.4 +/- 0.3 adults and 5.6 +/-
   0.7 nymphs per metre of row during late December 1994 to early January
   1995. The parasitoids Trissolcus basalis (17.6\%), Trissolcus oenone (<
   2\%) and Telenomus sp. (22.6\%) (Scelionidae) and the hyperparasitoid
   Acroclisoides sp. (Pteromalidae) emerged from eggs. The braconid
   Aridelus sp. (Euphorinae), and an undetermined genus of Tachinidae were
   recovered from late-instar nymphs and adults in which parasitisation
   averaged 0.8 and 1.4\%, respectively. Late-instar nymphs and adults of
   P. affinis were attacked by the predatory pentatomid Amyotea hamatus,
   the reduviid Pristhesancus plagipennis and Thomisidae spiders. In
   laboratory studies, female P. affinis had a mean (+/- SE) longevity of
   74.2 +/- 4.3 days, mean fecundity of 423.0 +/- 30.3 eggs per female, and
   a mean pre-oviposition period of 7.9 +/- 0.5 days; males lived on
   average 44.8 +/- 6.4 days. Other plant-feeding bugs associated with
   raspberry were Nezara viridula, Cuspicona simplex, Piezodorous hybneri
   (Pentatomidae) and Amblypelta nitida (Coreidae).}},

Abstract = {{In a long-term field trial in northwestern Switzerland, the effects of
   organic and conventional land-use management on earthworm populations
   and on soil erodibility were investigated. A silt loam soil which had
   developed in deep deposits of alluvial loess characterised the study
   site. Three methods were applied to analyse soil erodibility, at three
   different periods between autumn 1992 and 1993: aggregate stability
   (measured in the laboratory by a high energy rainfall simulation and by
   percolation) and soil particle detachment (measured in the field by
   splash erosion). Earthworm biomass and density, as well as the
   population diversity, were significantly greater on the organic plots
   than on the conventional plots. Likewise, the aggregate stability of the
   organic plots, when determined by means of percolation, was
   significantly better. Therefore, erosion susceptibility is greater on
   plots farmed conventionally. On the other hand, splash erosion
   monitoring and simulated rainfall experiments only partially highlight
   differences in erodibility between the two main land-management methods.
   Future comparisons between the farming systems should also include
   farmer managed fields with greater differentiation in crop rotations and
   cultural practices like tillage, fertilisation and pesticide use. (C)

   for Reithrodontomys. Annual variability in abundance was positively
   correlated between the following pairs of genera:
   Sigmodon-Reithrodontomys, Peromyscus-Onychomys,
   Onychomys-Reithrodontomys, and Dipodomys-Chaetodipus. Annual abundance
   of Sigmodon in winter was positively correlated with rainfall in the
   prior growing season. Analysis of the distribution of the composite

   of simultaneously parasitized larvae of the host Helicoverpa zee
   (Boddie), made by hybridization probe assay of unamplified host
   homogenates and by dissection, are not statistically distinguishable for
   1st or 2nd instar parasitoids. It should be possible to perform the

Abstract = {{The temporal changes in the composition of different instars of
   Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), was studied in
   Thessaloniki, northern Greece, an area located within the European
   northern limits of the fly's distribution. Field infested `Golden
   Delicious' apples and apples of an unidentified local variety, were
   collected in autumn 1994, maintained outdoors during the winter of
   1994-1995, and regularly monitored for immature stages of Mediterranean
   fruit ny. No eggs were found alive after the end of November. High
   incidences of 3rd instars inside fruits, and of fully grown larvae
   emerging from fruits to pupate, occurred in December-January. In both
   varieties, mortality and the emergence of the fully grown larvae from
   fruits reduced the number of living larvae per fruit from approximate to
   5 at the end of November to <1.3 at the end of December and to <0.3 by
   March. A low percentage (3.1 and 4.4\% for the Golden Delicious and
   local-variety apples, respectively) of Ist instars remained inside the
   fruits without molting until early March. Second instars were found in
   high numbers (20-70\% of the larval population) from November to March.
   The results suggest that larvae that molted to the 3rd instar during
   lute autumn to winter pupate and die, but 1st and 2nd instars survive.
   They are thus the main overwintering stage of C. capitata in northern
   Greece, yielding small adult populations in the spring. The importance
   of slow larval growth for successful overwintering is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of the tropical crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus in earthen
   ponds under ambient winter temperatures was studied in the temperate
   zone in the central coastal plain of Israel. Four treatment groups in
   which sex and size were each tested at two levels were simultaneously
   run in four replicates over a period of 118 days (28 November 1996-26
   March 1997). Minimum and maximum water temperatures were monitored every
   day, with minimum daily temperatures of under 10 degrees C being
   recorded on six days. Overall survival was 60\%; neither independent nor
   combined effects of sex and size on survival were found to be
   significant. Change in weight was minimal and few crayfishes entered
   baited traps, probably reflecting the reduced motor activity and feeding
   at low water temperatures. The economic implications of crayfish
   survival in earthen ponds under ambient winter temperatures, as well as
   the potential establishment of wild populations are discussed. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{1. The Environment Agency has compiled a comprehensive database of the
   physical structure of British rivers using the River Habitat Survey
   (RHS) methodology.
   2. A series of models was developed to ascertain whether RHS could be
   used to predict the environmental requirements of riverine species.
   Austropotamobius pallipes (Lereboullet) was chosen for the model, as it
   is an endangered species throughout Europe. In Britain, many populations
   have been eradicated or severely depleted by the crayfish plague (an
   introduced fungal disease), pollution, competition from non-native
   species and loss of habitat.
   3. A series of models was developed to predict crayfish occurrence
   according to habitat features recorded on the Environment Agency RHS
   database, and also from map-derived information. Sites surveyed for
   crayfish were matched to existing RHS sites. Incidental sightings during
   Agency routine biological or fisheries monitoring were also included.
   4. Logistic regressions on RHS variables yielded two models which showed
   suitable fit of the data, and high success rates when tested on an
   independent sample of sites. The first model mainly comprised variables
   on channel vegetation and on bank and channel structure. Further
   analyses without channel vegetation yielded a second model with
   variables more closely related to crayfish habitat. The variables
   identified as having a positive impact on crayfish presence were
   overhanging boughs, the presence of boulders, the amount of tree shading
   and the number of riffles. The variables with a negative impact were
   exposed tree roots, eroding cliffs, the amount of poached or reinforced
   banks, gravel/pebble/sand banks and cobble substrate.
   5. A discriminant analysis on crayfish presence/absence according to
   altitude, slope and distance from source transformed for normality,
   showed that crayfish could be predicted from map-derived information.
   Results were discussed and consideration was given to the wider
   applicability and potential uses of the models. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{To date, there have been only limited investigations of immunocompetence
   in natural invertebrate populations. The current study monitored a
   variety of immune parameters in the marine mussel, Mytilus edulis, from
   six sites within the UK, comparing ones with histories of severe
   contamination problems with relatively uncontaminated reference sites.
   Assays for immunocompetence in live blood cells (haemocytes) included
   tests for phagocytosis, superoxide generation and enzyme activity.
   Monoclonal antibody probes were also used to investigate variations in
   molecular characteristics of the haemocytes. The results showed that
   significant differences in immunocompetence were evident between mussels
   from contaminated and reference sites. Haemocytes of mussels from
   contaminated sites showed enhanced superoxide production and reduced
   activity of degradative enzymes, effects which may result in tissue
   damage or have implications for the efficient destruction of invading
   microorganisms. Significant reductions in the binding of certain
   monoclonal antibodies to haemocyte epitopes were observed too in mussels
   from contaminated sites. The results from this study show that
   immunomodulation is evident in animals from chronically contaminated
   sites, although it is difficult to attribute observed changes to any one
   contaminant. Certain modulations, such as increased superoxide
   generation, occurred in mussels from all three contaminated sites, while
   others were observed only at one. The results indicate that not all
   immune parameters are affected by contamination and that the type and
   extent of effects on immune defences vary with the nature or
   concentration of the contaminants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Flight feathers from six bird species at Clear Lake, CA were analyzed to
   determine the extent and distribution of mercury contamination from an
   abandoned mercury mine and associated levels of 14 other elements.
   Feather samples were collected from adult and juvenile osprey (Pandion
   haliaetus), including juvenile osprey from three additional comparison
   sites; adult western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis); adult great
   blue herons (Ardea herodias); adult mallards (Anas platyrhynchos); adult
   turkey vultures (Cathartes aura); and juvenile double-crested cormorants
   (Phalacrocorax auritus). Samples were analyzed by a multielemental x-ray
   fluorescence method. The osprey from Clear Lake showed significantly
   elevated mercury concentrations relative to the comparison sites,
   Different species at Clear Lake had different mercury concentrations
   based on trophic status; osprey exhibited the highest mercury
   concentrations and the mallards showed the lowest, Lastly, we quantified
   differences in elemental concentrations, including mercury, between
   adult and juvenile osprey from Clear Lake. Elements known to be
   nutrients, such as sulfur and zinc, did not vary significantly among
   species or sites. Reproductive success of osprey at Clear Lake was
   monitored from 1992 to 1996 to determine if osprey reproduction was
   depressed. During this five-year period, the breeding population grew
   from 10 to 20 nesting pairs and the average reproductive rate was 1.4
   fledglings per nesting attempt. Although the osprey showed the highest
   mercury levels of any species sampled, their reproduction does not
   appear to be depressed.}},

Abstract = {{Quick studies on biodiversity are frequently used in conservation
   assessments. Conclusions from these studies would be consistent if
   assemblages under consideration are stable over time. The stability of
   butterfly assemblages in the Picos de Europa in northern Spain was
   examined at several levels of numerical resolution. The survey was
   carried out in 1993 and 1995, which allowed at least one complete
   turnover of all individuals in each locality. Butterfly assemblages were
   usually stable at the levels of number of species and total number of
   individuals, species presence and absence, and abundance rankings. But,
   absolute abundances of individual species changed from 1993 to 1995 out
   of synchrony with one another. Regional distributions and altitudinal
   ranges of species were also stable. Assemblages were similar in both
   study years, judging by similar site ordinations by reciprocal
   averaging. Overall, these results are in accordance with most studies
   where stability has been examined at several numerical levels; they also
   suggest that abundances of individual species do not vary enough to
   disrupt overall assemblage abundance rankings. Butterfly assemblages at
   sites at higher altitude tended to be more unstable in terms of
   abundance rankings and absolute abundances. This agrees with. ecological
   theory predicting less stable assemblages in physically `harsh'
   environments. We concluded that monitoring for a relatively short time
   period can give a clear picture of both local and regional butterfly
   biodiversity and species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being a relatively recent development, the mapping of bird
   distributions using grid-based atlases has become one of the most
   frequent forms of ornithological survey. The data generated by
   ornithological atlases have a number of potential uses which are
   reviewed in this paper under the following categories: (1) education and
   recreation, (2) documenting distribution and population for conservation
   purposes, (3) documenting changes in population and range, (4) providing
   a framework for survey design, (5) assessing bird-environment
   associations, (6) generating hypotheses about causes of range change and
   (7) investigating theoretical aspects of ecology. The strengths and
   weaknesses of atlas data are considered in each case. We conclude that,
   despite a number of statistical and methodological problems which need
   to be addressed, atlases have become an indispensable tool for assessing
   large-scale patterns of bird distribution and distributional change and
   for answering a wide range of questions relating to them. They have many
   applications in ecology and conservation and should be regarded as an
   essential complement to annual population monitoring schemes and
   fine-scale studies of bird-habitat relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The status and distribution of Common Scoters Melanitta nigra nigra in
   Britain and Ireland were determined from a survey ill April-lune 1995.
   Three visits were made to all known, and a sample of potential, breeding
   sires. A total of 439 birds runs located, from which the British and
   Irish population was estimated at 195 pairs (100 in Ireland, 95 in
   Britain). In Ireland, three sites held 100 pairs or 51\% of the
   population. In Britain, birds were spread over 61 sites in 23 10-km
   squares, all in Scotland. Breeding Common Scoters are somewhat more
   abundant in Britain and Ireland than hitherto thought. However, this is
   due mainly to comprehensive survey coverage in 1995 and, over the past
   30 years, Common Scoters have actually suffered both population decline
   and range contraction. The Irish population declined from 180 to 100
   pairs between 1967 and 1981, but has since remained stable. In Britain,
   Common Scoters have ceased to breed on Shetland, in Central Scotland,
   and in Dumfries \& Galloway. Historical data are lacking, brit ill the
   Flow Country numbers have declined from some 50 pairs in 1988 to 35
   pairs in 1995. All birds in Ireland, but only half of those in Britain
   were on protected sites. Given the Common Scoter's threatened status in
   BI Britain and Ireland and since the population dynamics of the species
   are largely unknown, annual monitoring of numbers and productivity is
   required to determine population trends and establish natural limits of
   population fluctuation. AS Common Scoters in Britain and Ireland are
   threatened both by factors operating over whole water catchments
   (deteriorating water quality resulting from eutrophication and
   afforestation) and at individual sites (competition with introduced
   Roach, predation by American Mink), integrated catchment management
   plans, including site safeguard measures, seem necessary for the
   effective conservation of the species.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding ecology of the Red-necked Grebe, Podiceps grisegena, was
   investigated on a 38-km(2) study area near Yellowknife, Northwest
   Territories (62 degrees 27'N, 114 degrees 22'W). Population size and
   productivity were monitored during 1986-1996, whereas other aspects of
   breeding ecology were studied opportunistically. The mean breeding
   population was 59 pairs, representing a density of 1.6 pairs/km(2).. The
   mean size of ponds used for breeding was 3.7 +/- 0.2 (SE) ha. Plants
   most commonly used as cover and support at nests were cattail (Typha
   latifolia), sedge (Carex spp.), willow (Salix spp.), and horsetail
   (Equisetum fluviatile). Nests were constructed of emergent and
   submergent giants, most commonly sedge, sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.),
   cattail, horsetail, and pond lily (Nuphar variegatum), Nests were
   generally located well away from the shore (mean distance from shore:
   14.8 +/- 1.7 m), within the emergent vegetation zone but close to open
   water (mean distance to open water: 1.5 +/- 0.3 m). Mean depth of water
   at nests was 63 +/- 3 cm. We observed an average clutch size of 4.4 +/-
   0.1 eggs, average brood success of 72\%, and a production rate of 2.0
   young per successful pair or 1.4 young per breeding pair. These values
   are similar or slightly higher than those reported for the species
   elsewhere in North America. Our results, in addition to information from
   other published and unpublished sources, indicate that the Red-necked
   Grebe is abundant and has a widespread distribution in the southwestern
   Northwest Territories. The Northwest Territories breeding population
   appears to be a significant component of the national population of this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Forage deterioration due to field and storage fungi represents a major
   economic loss for hay producers. A series of experiments was conducted
   to develop a methodology for screening alfalfa plants for resistance to
   post-harvest fungal colonization. Pure cultures of Aspergillus glaucus,
   Aspergillus repens, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus versicolor and
   Aspergillus fumigatus, isolated from alfalfa forage sampled during field
   wilting and storage, were established and maintained to produce a 10(5)
   spore mL(-1) suspension containing an equal proportion of spores from
   each Aspergillus spp. Alfalfa leaves were dipped in concentrations of
   propionic acid solution to simulate levels of resistance to fungal
   activity. Fully-developed trifoliate leaves were placed adaxial side
   down onto petri plates containing a dichloran (2 mg mL(-1)) and glycerol
   (18\% vol/vol) agar. The Aspergillus spp. spore suspension was sprayed
   onto each petri plate and the plates were incubated under dark
   conditions at 25 degrees C and 70\% relative humidity. Plates were
   monitored daily for percent of leaf area colonized. The random screening
   of a small population of cloned alfalfa genotypes using this screening
   procedure indicated that variation in post-harvest resistance to fungal
   attack does exist for greenhouse and field-grown plants harvested at an
   early vegetative stage. Leaf dry matter was not related to genotype
   variation in post-harvest susceptibility to fungal colonization;
   however, leaf soluble carbohydrate level was negatively correlated (P <
   0.05) with leaf area colonized, The screening procedure did not detect
   consistent differences among genotypes when dried leaves were used.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate change may have a serious impact on genetic resources in
   tropical forest trees. Genetic diversity plays a critical role in the
   survival of populations in rapidly changing environments. Furthermore,
   most tropical plant species are known to have unique ecological niches,
   and therefore changes in climate may directly affect the distribution of
   biomes, ecosystems, and constituent species. Climate change may also
   indirectly affect plant genetic resources through effects on phenology,
   breeding systems, and plant-pollinator and plant seed disperser
   interactions, and may reduce genetic diversity and reproductive output.
   As a consequence, population densities may be reduced leading to
   reduction in genetic diversity through genetic drift and inbreeding.
   Tropical forest plants may respond to climate change through phenotypic
   plasticity, adaptive evolution, migration to suitable site, or
   extinction. However, the potential to respond is limited by a rapid pace
   of change and the non-availability of alternate habitats due to past and
   present trends of deforestation. Thus climate change may result in
   extinction of many populations and species.
   Our ability to estimate the precise response of tropical forest
   ecosystems to climate change is limited by lack of long-term data on
   parameters that might be affected by climate change. Collection of
   correlative data from long-term monitoring of climate as well as
   population and community responses at selected sites offer the most
   cost-effective way to understand the effects of climate change on
   tropical tree populations. However, mitigation strategies need to be
   implemented immediately. Because many effects of climate change may be
   similar to the effects of habitat alteration and fragmentation,
   protected areas and buffer zones should be enlarged, with an emphasis on
   connectivity among conserved landscapes. Taxa that are likely to become
   extinct should be identified and protected through at situ conservation
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{I conducted field experiments in a western New York marsh to quantify
   concurrently the impacts of resource limitation and predation on benthic
   midge populations (Chironomus plumosus, Chironomus tentans, and
   Glyptotendipes barbipes). Biomass of cattail litter (Typha sp.), numbers
   of small insectivorous fish (primarily juvenile carp, Cyprinus carpio,
   and to a lesser extent juvenile brown bullhead, Ictalurus nebulosus), or
   numbers of large fish (primarily adult brown bullhead, which will
   consume both midges and small fish) were manipulated in mesh-walled
   mesocosms (1.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 m). Using core sampling, midge population
   responses to manipulations were monitored from early May through late
   August.
   Trophic responses of marsh midges to resources and predation changed
   temporally over the summer. In June, neither resource limitation nor
   predation by fish significantly influenced midge numbers. In July, after
   juvenile carp and brown bullhead first became abundant from the spawn,
   these small insectivorous fish significantly reduced midge larval
   densities. At that time, midge densities still did not respond to
   variable detritus supplies. By August, both predation by small fish and
   available supplies of cattail litter significantly affected midge
   numbers. Because midges did not respond to a nonnutritive mimic of
   cattail litter, it suggests that resource limitation of midge abundance
   was nutritionally based. Feeding by large adult bullhead had no apparent
   direct or indirect influence on midge densities in any month. Small fish
   largely disappeared from the study habitats by August, but populations
   of midge larvae did not rebound because they had stopped breeding for
   that year. This study supports emerging concepts on the integrated
   influences of top-down and bottom-up trophic interaction on food web
   function. Predation and resource limitation were simultaneously
   influencing midge abundance. Results also emphasize how life history
   phenologies of predators and prey can contribute to temporal variation
   in food web structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{In a mesocosm study, the effects of a gradient of tributyltin (TBT)
   (nominal TBT concentrations of 0.3, 2.3, 18.5, 146, and 1150 ng Sn
   liter(-1)) on Mytilus edulis larvae and postlarvae, including the
   settlement phase, were investigated over 15 days. Effects of TBT on
   mortality, growth measured as increase in shell length, shell
   dimensions, and settlement were evaluated, In general, mortality was
   high in all mesocosms including the control; during the first 24 h of
   the experiment, mortality was 63\% at the highest TBT concentration
   (26\% in the control), An LC50 (24 h) of 254 ng Sn liter(-1) was
   estimated. The mortality rate of larvae/postlarvae increased 40\% at
   18.5 ng Sn liter(-1) (0.41 day(-1)) compared with the control (0.30
   day(-1)), For postlarvae, the growth rate decreased with increasing TBT
   concentration. The mean shell length at 2.3 ng Sn liter(-1) was
   significantly reduced in comparison to the control on Day 15. Then EC50
   (15 days) for shell growth was estimated to be 5.4 ng Sn liter(-1). This
   is the lowest effect concentration ever reported in the literature. For
   postlarvae, shell dimensions in terms of shell length-shell width
   relations were affected by TBT at 1150 ng Sn liter(-1), because the
   reduced growth led to the failure of adult mussels to secrete a
   dissochonch shell. During the first days of exposure, the settlement
   monitored on polyethylene settling strips was stimulated by TBT, after
   which the settlement decreased due to the high mortality. Only a small
   portion of the population survived to the end of the test period, By
   comparison of the biotic conditions (in terms of larval abundance and
   particle concentration reflecting larval food) in the control mesocosm
   with those in the cove where the experiment was conducted, it was
   concluded that the mesocosm had successfully simulated the field
   conditions. (C) 1998 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining raptor populations is a primary objective of the legislation
   that designates the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation
   Area. Army training activities could influence habitat quality for
   raptors by changing the density, productivity, or behavior of their
   Townsend's ground squirrel (Spermophilus townsendii) prey. These changes
   could occur directly or as a result of changes in the vegetation
   available as food and cover for the ground squirrels. We assessed the
   effects of long-term tracking by armored vehicles by comparing 9-ha
   areas in sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)-dominated shrubsteppe and
   bluegrass (Poa secunda)-dominated grasslands subjected to low-intensity
   tracking for similar to 50 years with others that had not been tracked.
   We did not detect any effect on ground squirrel population dynamics
   associated with long-term tracking. Although densities of adults and
   juveniles tended to be higher in the areas exposed to such tracking, we
   attribute this difference to other factors that varied spatially. To
   determine short-term (two-year) effects, we experimentally tracked two
   sagebrush and two grassland sites with an M-1 tank after animals had
   begun their inactive season. In the following two active seasons we
   monitored squirrel demography and behavior and vegetative
   characteristics on the experimentally tracked sites and compared the
   results with control sites. Although we experimentally tracked similar
   to 33\% of the surface of each of four sites where ground squirrel
   densities were assessed, the tracking had a detectable effect only on
   some herbaceous perennials and did not influence ground squirrel
   densities or behavior significantly during the subsequent two active
   seasons. We conclude that tracking after the start of the inactive
   season is likely to influence ground squirrel demography or behavior
   only if vegetation cover is substantially changed by decreasing coverage
   of preferred food plants or increasing the coverage of annual grasses
   and forbs that are succulent for only a short time each year.}},

Abstract = {{Tidal marshes have been actively restored in Connecticut for nearly 20
   years, but evaluations of these projects are typically based solely on
   observations of vegetation change. A formerly impounded valley marsh at
   the Barn Island Wildlife Management Area is a notable exception;
   previous research at this site has also included assessments of primary
   productivity macroinvertebrates, and use by fishes. To determine the
   effects of marsh restoration on higher trophic levels, we monitored bird
   use at five sites within the Barn Island complex, including both
   restoration and reference marshes. Use by summer bird populations within
   fixed plots was monitored over two years at all sites. Our principal
   focus was Impoundment One, a previously impounded valley marsh reopened
   to full tidal exchange in 1982. This restoration site supported a
   greater abundance of wetland birds than our other sites, indicating that
   it is at least equivalent to reference marshes within the same system
   for this ecological function. Moreover, the species richness of birds
   and their frequency of occurrence at impoundment One was greater than at
   11 other estuarine marshes in southeastern Connecticut surveyed in a
   related investigation. A second marsh, under restoration for
   approximately ten years, appears to be developing in a similar fashion.
   These results complement previous studies on vegetation,
   macroinvertebrates, and fish use in this system to show that, over time,
   the reintroduction of tidal flooding can effectively restore important
   ecological functions to previously impounded tidal marshes.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of spraying the common fertilizer, sodium
   ammonium nitrate, on cattle pastures in central Florida. Shrikes are
   considered good indicators of habitat quality. Hence, eight pairs of
   shrikes whose territories were sprayed were considered as the treatment
   group, and four pairs in unsprayed territories as controls. The
   fertilizer was sprayed on 18 June 1992, when the resident shrikes were
   into their second and third nests, and within 24 h the dominant bahia
   grass and patches of blackberry bushes became chlorotic. The eight
   treatment pairs expanded their territories significantly by 138.5\% on
   average, and the smaller their initial territory, the greater the
   change. The total number of insects collected in the sprayed pasture in
   the first three weeks was extremely low compared to the number in the
   unsprayed pasture. In the control pairs no loss of eggs, young, or
   adults owing to abiotic causes was observed. However, in the treatment
   pairs seven eggs, two nestlings, and eight fledglings disappeared, or
   died from causes attributed to the spraying. In addition, seven females
   and one male disappeared, and one territory was abandoned. Our
   observations suggest the need for additional studies to examine the
   effects of supposedly ``environmentally friendly{''} fertilizers and
   show the value of monitoring breeding bird populations in agricultural
   systems.}},

   are female-produced sex pheromone components of the pyralid moth,
   Diatraea considerata (Heinrich). Compounds extracted from pheromone
   glands were identified by coupled gas
   chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and coupled
   CC-mass spectrometry (MS). In field trapping experiments, Z11-16:Aid,
   Z7-16:Aid or Z13-18:Ald singly were behaviourally inactive, but in
   ternary combination were as attractive as virgin females. Deleting
   either Z11-16:Ald or Z7-16:Aid from the ternary aldehyde blend strongly
   reduced attractiveness indicating that these two compounds are most
   important for attraction of males. Congeneric and sympatric female D.
   grandiosella (Dyar) also utilize Z11-16:Aid and Z13-18:Ald as sex
   pheromone components. Production of Z9-16:Ald by female D. grandiosella
   and Z7-16:Ald by female D. considerata contributes to the specificity of
   pheromone blends but does not prevent cross-attraction of heterospecific
   males. In sugarcane plantations, aldehyde (Z11-16:Ald, Z7-16:Ald and

   monitor population densities of D. considerata.}},

Abstract = {{From 1988 to 1994, adult vial bioassays were conducted on bollworms,
   Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), collected from pheromone traps in Missouri to
   determine their susceptibility to pyrethroids. Although most moths were
   susceptible to cypermethrin, many assays contained individuals that
   survived concentrations of 5 and 10 mu g per vial. The number of
   individuals that survived these concentrations increased each of the
   first 3 yrs, and then fluctuated from year to year. In some cases, moths
   with increased tolerance to cypermethrin occurred in locations where
   little or no pyrethroid insecticides were used for bollworm control. A
   likely explanation for tolerant bollworms in Missouri is immigration
   from more southerly locations, and evidence for long range dispersal of
   these insects is presented. Implications for regional resistance
   monitoring also are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The regulatory performance standards and monitoring requirements that
   are used to evaluate reclamation success in nine western North America
   jurisdictions were reviewed. Ecosystem-based reclamation monitoring, a
   crucial part of regulatory enforcement and adaptive environmental
   management, was lacking in most jurisdictions. Reclamation practices and
   regulatory control in each jurisdiction would be improved greatly by
   effective long-term monitoring. A set of performance standards
   (including productivity, land use capability and functional dynamics) is
   proposed which better integrates with a phased bond release process. As
   well, a long-term hierarchical (population, community ecosystem,
   landscape) monitoring programme is proposed. (C) 1998 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) to the exposure of
   adult nonsmoking Californians was determined for selected toxic air
   contaminants (TACs). The assessment was based an published measurements
   of ETS emission factors and personal exposures to volatile organic
   compounds. The human exposure studies were conducted in three California
   areas - Los Angeles, Pittsburg/Antioch, and Woodland between 1984 and
   1990. We derived unexposed and passive population exposure distributions
   by randomly sampling the monitoring results for individuals classified
   according to exposure status (active smoker, passively exposed, or
   unexposed to ETS during monitoring). The differences between the
   unexposed and passive distributions were used to estimate the ETS-only
   contribution for exposure to benzene, styrene, o-xylene, and mg-xylene.
   Emission factors were then employed to infer the ETS-caused exposure to
   thirteen other compounds. The estimated arithmetic mean increments of
   24-hour exposure attributable to ETS for the nonsmoking Californian
   population (age greater than or equal to 7) exposed to ETS are as
   follows (results in units of mu g m(-3) exposure concentration; results
   using two different emission factors presented as a range): acetaldehyde
   11-15; acetonitrile 7.0; acrylonitrile 0.49; benzene 1.02; 1,3-butadiene
   0.75-2.3; 2-butanone 1.4; o-cresol 0.17; m,p-cresol 0.41; ethyl acrylate
   < 0.015; ethylbenzene 0.49-0.64; formaldehyde 6.5-8.2;
   n-nitrosodimethylamine 0.0028; phenol 1.4; styrene 0.36; toluene
   3.1-3.2; o-xylene 0.77; m,p-xylene 0.99. The 90\% confidence limits on
   these estimates due to the limited sample size in the studies are
   roughly x/divided by 6. For four winery studied compounds, ETS is
   estimated to contribute the following percentages to the total
   inhalation exposure of all nonsmoking Californians: o-xylene 5\%;
   m,p-xylene 3\%; benzene 5\%; and styrene 8\%.}},

Abstract = {{Insecticide resistance often is blamed for failures of insecticides to
   control cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche). Yet the genetics and
   adaptive advantage of resistance traits remain unexamined. Lethal doses
   of insecticides that kill 50\% of the population fluctuate 7-fold within
   a cat nea strain. Many reports of flea resistance may be attributable to
   variable mortality from effects of solvents, substrates, humidities,
   temperatures, colonization, and ages of fleas. Resistance ratios (ratios
   of lethal doses of a resistant to a susceptible strain) are <690-fold in
   fleas; lower than many other arthropods. This, plus strain variability,
   hinders resistance detection. Relationships between resistance levels,
   control failures, and health threats are unclear. Insensitive
   acetylcholinesterase, knock-down recovery, glutathione transferase
   conjugation, and mixed function oxidase/cytochrome P450 are demonstrated
   resistance mechanisms in cat fleas. Ecological genetics of resistance in
   cat fleas probably involves flea transfer among hosts, host movements,
   refugia, founder effects, and mortality from abiotic factors.
   Understanding cat nea resistance requires population monitoring before,
   during, and after insecticide treatments using conventional and rapid
   molecular bioassays. Sustained insecticide release devices such as nea
   collars and long-lived insecticide residues for premises possibly
   contribute to the development of resistance. New systemic and topical
   insecticides, especially when given prophylactically, may act similarly.
   Eliminating insecticides prevents insecticide resistance but
   necessitates application of biorational tactics incorporating
   mechanical, environmental, and cultural controls. Using high
   temperatures, low humidities, host grooming and such tactics as
   decreasing doses, increasing action thresholds, rotating insecticides,
   and leaving spatial and temporal refugia may suppress cat nea
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the effect of vegetative destruction by controlled burns
   in reducing the abundance of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis
   Say, the vector for the agents of Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and
   human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, is limited. Therefore, the abundance of
   nymphal, larval, and adult I. scapularis was monitored by dragging the
   vegetation at 2 separate 4-ha tracts in Cockaponset State Forest in
   Connecticut following a single controlled burn on 15 April or 21 May
   1992. The burn at the April burn site was rated as light to moderate
   with a flame height of 0.3 m and consumed approximate to 67\% of the
   surface leaf litter. The burn at the May burn site was rated moderate to
   severe with a flame height of 0.6-0.9 m., which consumed vegetation <5
   cm in diameter and approximate to 100\% of the surface leaf litter. The
   impact of the burn was strongly influenced by the intensity and timing
   of the burn. Burning of the vegetation resulted in a reduction of the
   abundance of nymphal I. scapularis by 74\% at the moderately burned site
   and 97\% at the severely burned site, compared with adjacent unburned
   woodland. No larvae were recovered later in the summer from the severely
   burned tract. However, judging by the comparable abundance of adult I.
   scapularis in the fall at the burned and unburned woodlands, the effect
   of the burns was temporary. Burning the vegetation for the control of I.
   scapularis appears limited in effect and could be applied only on a
   large scale in areas with little or no human habitations.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work Mas to investigate the possible use of the
   clam Tapes philippinarum-a filter-feeding bivalve living on soft
   bottoms-in the monitoring of sediment pollution in the Lagoon of Venice
   (North-East Italy). Ib this end two clam populations, exposed to
   different environmental conditions (a relative clean site and an
   industrial polluted area), have been monitored for the prevalence of the
   protozoan parasite Perkinsus sp. as well as for several biological
   parameters commonly used as determinants of contaminants exposure. First
   results showed a low prevalence, higher in the clean site, but a very
   diffuse distribution of the parasite throughout the two populations.
   Nevertheless, greater digestive cells height and longer lysosomal
   latency time were observed in clams from the clean area. As for the
   physiological stress-related parameters, even if clearance rates were
   always higher in these clams, scope for growth values indicated a more
   complicated biological response. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyses reactions that result
   in the generation of nitric oxide (NO), a multipotent signal molecule.
   We have begun to characterise the activity of NOS found in the host
   tissue of the symbiotic tropical/sub-tropical anemone Aiptasia pallida,
   and have monitored changes in the activity of this enzyme under
   different environmental conditions. Our characterisation studies
   indicate that the NOS activity from Aiptasia is similar to activities
   from other organisms in terms of cellular localisation, cofactor
   requirements, and inhibition profiles. Our environmental experiments
   indicate that: (I) the incubation of whole animals at temperatures
   representative of the highest and lowest extremes to which the Bermuda
   population would be exposed results in an NOS activity reduction
   relative to animals maintained at the control temperature of 25 degrees
   C; and (2) treatment with copper produces variable changes in NOS
   activity relative to untreated controls. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   and they were declared ``Endangered{''} in 1983.
   The numerical progress of the population has been monitored since 1973
   by continued sample surveys. Nine of 10 surveys were aerial, and of
   those 9, 7 used high-altitude aerial photography. Published indices of
   population size showed an average increase of about 17 belugas per year
   (SE = 4) and a 1995 smoothed value of about 650 (SE = 40) belugas. This
   apparent temporal trend might be open to question owing to slight
   variation in survey methods and in the area covered by different
   surveys, so factors were developed to correct for differences in survey
   coverage and in treatment of data and for the effect of hunting on
   population trajectory. Revised assessments of the population trajectory
   and of the present smoothed index value changed little as a result, A
   series of total-count surveys in 1987-1992 estimated a decline of about
   6 belugas per year, and when they were combined with sample surveys
   flown in 1984-1995, an increase of 10 belugas per year was estimated and
   a 1995 standardized index of about 640 (SE = 43). It appeared that
   hunting in the 1970s could have consumed all of, perhaps even slightly
   more than, the potential for natural increase of this population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents data on levels of tar ball deposits on same beaches
   in Cameroon, It is also aimed at educating the coastal population on
   possible control measures. Both environmental monitoring and cleanup are
   important components of integrated coastal management.
   Three sampling sites, which include commercial (fishing ana transport),
   touristic and reference beaches, were sampled for stranded tar balls
   between September 1995 and August 1996, Tar balls were by hand, usually
   at low tide, within a area of 500 m(2), followed by counting and
   weighing.
   No trends were observed in the temporal and spatial distribution of the
   tar halls. Mean monthly concentrations of 0.31, 4.88 and 0.11 g m(-2)
   respectively were obtained for the three beaches sampled, with the
   highest value of 4.88 g m-2 obtained at the touristic beach near the oil
   refinery (SO.NA.RA.). These concentrations, which fell within the levels
   recorded in other studies, reflect the influence of coastal processes
   and impact of refinery activities and vessels in transit. The
   application of a recommended method of discarding of tar ball deposits
   through hand-picking resulted in the removal of 229 tar balls over a
   distance of 0.4 km, These were discarded at the Limbe municipality waste
   disposal site (located behind Limbe main market) followed by burning,
   This acted as a forum to educate the coastal population on control
   measures which could help to create a healthy coastal environment. (C)

Abstract = {{The sheep biting louse (Bovicola ovis) feeds superficially on the skin
   of sheep but appears to stimulate an immune response. In this study we
   examined the association between louse infestation and serum and skin
   surface antibodies. Louse numbers were monitored on experimentally
   infested Polypay and Columbia ewes for two years and on their lambs in
   the second year. Serum and skin wash samples were tested for antibodies
   to soluble extracts of B. ovis, Stomoxys calcitrans and Musca autumnalis
   by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, the effects
   of skin wash extracts on B, avis were examined in vitro.
   The titre of anti-B. ovis antibodies in the serum did not differ
   significantly between infested and naive awes. However, there was an
   increase in serum antibody titre which coincided with periods of high
   louse density in ewes with high louse counts. Infested lambs had higher
   serum antibody levels than naive lambs. Substantial cross reactivity was
   evident among extracts of the different insects.
   Densities of lice on the ewes during population decline were negatively
   related to the titre of skin surface antibodies. Skin washings collected
   from sheep during B. ovis population decline reduced the number of louse
   progeny when incorporated into louse diet. These results indicate that
   B. ovis stimulates an immune response in sheep and suggest that
   compounds on the skin surface may play a role in the regulation of louse
   populations.}},

   pC194 was released into mushroom compost microcosms and populations were
   monitored at different incubation temperatures. The organism colonized
   both sterile and untreated compost at 37 degrees C, and to a lesser
   extent at 50 degrees C, but was eliminated after 30 d at 65 degrees C.
   Although sporulation of the B. subtilis population occurred within
   compost, the population was maintained for up to 13 weeks at 50 degrees
   C, largely as vegetative cells. Experiments in which the B. subtilis
   host strain, without plasmid, was released demonstrated that plasmid
   carriage had no effect on the ability of the bacterium to colonize and
   survive in compost. Furthermore, the size and composition of the
   indigenous bacterial population was unaffected by the presence of the
   introduced B. subtilis strain. Virtually no loss of plasmid pC194 from
   the B. subtilis population in compost was observed, and experiments at
   low growth rates in chemostats confirmed the stability of this
   host/vector system in the absence of positive selection pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The Falkland Islands are a globally important breeding location for
   seabirds, including penguins. The total breeding populations of three of
   the four main penguin species present in the Falklands were censused in
   the austral summer of 1995/96. The results for gentoo and rockhopper
   penguins suggest declines of about 43 and 90 per cent, respectively,
   since a similar census in 1932/33. Recent monitoring studies suggest
   that these declines are still continuing; research to investigate causes
   (which is likely to reflect changes in the marine rather than
   terrestrial environment) is a high priority. In contrast, king penguin
   populations, currently c. 400 pairs, have increased steadily, by 700 per
   cent since 1980/81, in line with world-wide trends for this species.}},

Abstract = {{A necrotic bacterial disease of mango trees (Mangifera indica) in Spain
   affecting buds, leaves, and stems is described for the first time.
   Necrosis of flower and vegetative buds on commercial trees during winter
   dormancy was the most destructive symptom of the disease. The apical
   necrosis is caused by Pseudomonas syringae, which was always isolated
   from mango trees with disease symptoms. Of 95 bacterial strains isolated
   from symptomatic tissues and characterized from 1992 to 1997, over 90\%
   were identified as P. syringae pv, syringae. Additional strains were
   isolated from healthy mango trees, and they were identical to the
   isolates from diseased tissues. Pathogenicity tests on mango plants
   showed that P. syringae pv. syringae incited the apical necrosis, but
   that climatic conditions determined the onset of disease development.
   Populations of total bacteria and of P. syringae and the number of
   active ice nuclei were monitored over a 3-year period. The largest
   populations of P. syringae were associated with cool, wet periods that
   coincided with the highest disease severity, whereas P. syringae was
   only occasionally detected on healthy trees. The median effective dose
   was estimated from infectivity titration assays.}},

Abstract = {{Sclerospora graminicola, the causal agent of downy mildew in pearl
   millet, is well-known for variation in its virulence pattern. Nine
   single-zoospore isolates (Sg 026-Z-1 to Sg 026-Z-9) derived from an
   oosporic isolate Sg 026 from a pearl millet F-1 hybrid cultivar Nath
   4209 grown in a farmer's field in a village, Veelad, in Maharashtra
   state, India, and three controls (Sg 026, Field-1, and field-2) were
   evaluated for their virulence in two experimental runs in a greenhouse.
   The isolates were maintained on pot-grown seedlings of a highly
   susceptible pearl millet line, 7042S, in a greenhouse through asexual
   (sporangial) generations. Pot-grown seedlings of six pearl millet
   potential differential lines/cultivars (7042S, NHB 3, MBH 110, ICMH 451,
   843B, and 852B) were spray-inoculated with a sporangial suspension (5 x
   10(5) sporangia ml(-1)) and maintained in a greenhouse at 25 +/- 2
   degrees C. Data were recorded for latent period (days) and disease
   incidence (\%), from which a virulence index (incidence x latent
   period(-1)) was calculated to quantify disease-causing potential of
   isolates. Results indicated significant variation in latent period,
   incidence, and virulence index among isolates. The isolates were
   classified into four distinct pathotype groups based on their virulence
   indices on six pearl millet lines. Because of the significant variation
   for virulence in the S. graminicola population infecting Nath 4209, it
   is recommended that the hybrid be regularly monitored for downy mildew
   infection in farmers' fields, and be replaced by a resistant cultivar
   that is genetically unrelated to the parental lines of Nath 4209. This
   will help delay or avoid development of downy mildew epidemics and the
   resulting heavy loss to pearl millet farmers in the region.}},

Abstract = {{The ectoparasitic mite Varroa jacobsoni Oud. presently poses one of the
   most serious problems faced by keepers of honeybees Apis mellifera L. To
   help understand why the mite has become such a serious problem a
   population dynamics model using recently published data has been
   constructed. The simulation model has been built by linking together
   various aspects of the mites' biology using computer software
   (ModelMaker(R)) in such a way that an initial population of mites can
   change daily over any period. The model predicts a yearly 12-fold
   increase in mite numbers or an intrinsic rate of daily increase of 0.021
   during the presence of bee brood. This corresponds well with field data.
   Values derived from the model for behaviours such as drone preference
   (5.5-12 times) and phoretic period (4-11 days) are similar to those
   actually observed. Therefore, the model can be used to predict the
   number of mites within any colony and their subsequent development over
   any period. Since the daily development of both the live population and
   numbers of dead mites are predicted by the model it can be used as a
   mite population monitoring tool. The model predicts that the ratio of
   live to dead mites will change dramatically between periods when bee
   brood is present or absent. However, since the ratios were shown to be
   stable within the periods, the mite population can be estimated
   throughout the year by multiplying the daily mite drop by approximate to
   250-500 or 20-40 when brood is absent or present, respectively. This
   will allow beekeepers to optimise their mite control strategy. The model
   also reveals the complex pattern in infestation levels that occurred
   throughout the year which was caused by the interactions between the bee
   and mite breeding cycles and will allow the role of bee viruses in the
   collapse of the colony to be studied in much greater detail. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Humoral antibodies to heat-stable antigens of Renibacterium salmoninarum
   (Rs) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in
   rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar
   challenged by immersion. A slow antibody response was found: 3\% (1/30)
   was positive 4 wk after immersion and 72 \% (26/36) was positive after 8
   wk. All 30 fish sampled after 4 wk were found to be infected, as
   determined by bacterial culture and/or the presence of soluble antigens
   in the kidney. At 6, 8 and 12 wk after immersion the proportion of
   positives indicated by ELISA was 58\%. The Rs infection was detected by
   cultivation in 36\% of sampled fish collected on the same occasion.
   Elevated antibody titres to Rs were detected in samples from both
   Atlantic salmon (59 \% in 1 farm) and from rainbow trout (20\% in 1 of 5
   sampled farms) in naturally exposed populations all of which classified
   positive for bacterial kidney disease (BKD). Elevated antibody titres
   were detected among sampled fish from populations of rainbow trout and
   salmon with clinical BKD. Samples collected from farm populations of
   rainbow trout, salmon and brown trout Salmo trutta, exposed to Rs but
   without clinical BKD, were negative in the ELISA, although Rs bacteria
   or soluble antigens were detected at the same sampling. The antibody
   ELISA method cannot be recommended for general fish health monitoring
   purposes, but may be a valuable tool for monitoring the disease
   progression during controlled experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of the impacts of the Ok Tedi copper mine on fish populations
   in the Fly River system in Papua New Guinea has recorded approx. 100
   species of fish representing 32 families. Fish catches have shown
   considerable temporal and spatial variability but, since the
   commencement of mine operations and the input of mine-derived waste
   material into the headwaters of the system, long-term monitoring has
   revealed significant reductions in fish catches at most riverine sites
   in the Ok Tedi, upper and middle Fly River. However, no significant
   declines in fish catches have been recorded in the lower Fly or delta
   areas. Possible mechanisms accounting for the declines in fish catches
   in the river are discussed. Although catches in some floodplain habitats
   have also declined, these changes are thought to be associated with the
   effects of natural climatic phenomena, particularly Fl Nine droughts.
   Introduced species and increased commercial and artisanal fishing may
   also have had an effect. Levels of copper, zinc, lead and cadmium were
   found to be elevated in tissues from a range of fish species taken from
   riverine and floodplain sites sampled in the Ok Tedi and Fly Rivers.
   Metal levels were generally much higher in liver and kidney than from
   flesh. There was a general trend for metal concentrations to decrease
   with distance downstream from the mine, suggesting a mine-related
   effect. Significantly higher metal concentrations were recorded at
   `impact' compared to `control' sites. The intake of dietary copper by
   humans consuming fish taken from the river is well within guidelines set
   by the World Health Organisation and does not constitute a health risk.
   Ok Tedi Mining Limited has recently initiated a programme of mitigation
   works aimed at reducing the adverse effects of mine wastes on the river
   environment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{165}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{81-93}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The behavioral responses of schools of young Koi fish (Cyprinus carpio)
   to sub-lethal ammonia concentrations were monitored using CCD cameras
   and computer image processing. Several geometrical parameters of the
   schools such as the position of the center of gravity, and the
   distribution of the fish were calculated continuously and plotted versus
   time. Swimming speed and activity were measured indirectly through a
   novel parameter-the Projected Mobility Picture (PMP). The immediate
   response of the treated fish was to dive to the bottom of the tank and
   stay there for a time period which increased with the ammonia
   concentration. Later, the fish rose to depths which increased with
   ammonia concentration. At high ammonia concentration, the fish
   approached the surface. Decreased activity of the treated fish was
   accompanied by a smaller mean distribution. Blood glucose levels of the
   treated fish increased, and they became indifferent to food. In general,
   this remote method of continuous monitoring of alterations in fish
   behavior under stress has the potential to be developed into a method
   for detecting early signs of stress in populations of fish. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Chironomus tepperi Skuse were reared individually at a range of constant
   temperatures from 12.5 to 37.5 degrees C (2.5 degrees C intervals), with
   development and survival monitored at regular intervals. C. tepperi is
   protandrous, with males developing significantly faster than females at
   the majority of temperatures examined, due primarily to a shorter final
   instar. Some individuals completed development at all temperatures,
   however emergent adults failed to successfully inflate their appendages
   at 37.5 degrees C. Developmental rate increased with increasing
   temperature up to 32.5 degrees C, but fell at 35 degrees C. Low adult
   emergence at 37.5 degrees C precluded a reliable estimate of total
   development time at that temperature. Survival to adult emergence varied
   from 10 to 60\%, with highest mortality in the pupal stage at all
   temperatures. Degree-days (DD) and developmental zero (DZ) estimates for
   egg to adult development are 150.5 DD and 10.5 degrees C for males and
   167.1 DD and 10.3 degrees C for females. DD and DZ estimates are
   presented for each developmental stage. The significance of wide thermal
   tolerances in a colonist midge species is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Bluefish Caves, northern Yukon, Canada, have yielded evidence of
   pre-Holocene human occupation of eastern Beringia. The three caves at
   Bluefish contain a large and complex late Pleistocene fauna in situ. Our
   research on the mortality patterns and the paleoethology of Equus lambei
   (an extinct species of horse), a dominant component of the Bluefish
   assemblages, was based on the dental remains. Mortality profiles for
   Equus lambei indicate that predators were the likely primary agents of
   bone accumulation at Cave I, while Caves II and III appear to have
   accumulated bones through accidental or natural deaths, probably
   regularly monitored by humans and other predator/scavengers.
   Paleoethological reconstruction for E, lambei supports the suggestion
   that the Bluefish Basin was not a polar desert during the late
   Pleistocene. Finally, the use of tooth height/age tables to establish
   age profiles of fossil equid populations is demonstrated to be limited
   to establishing broad, relative age categories.}},

   settlement by people, and birds suffer from human disturbance: numbers
   of river lapwings and villages per km of river are inversely correlated.
   Populations remote from human pressure are further threatened by
   hydropower development. The river lapwing is only one of a community of
   declining birds of sandbar habitats; four other species are approaching
   national extinction in Laos. A substantial proportion of a major
   catchment should be protected. Further studies and a monitoring

   compared to adjacent unenclosed areas over three years in Hampshire, UK.
   A range of arthropod monitoring techniques was used, including pitfall
   traps, fenced pitfall traps and D-vac suction samples. The enclosures
   were effective in reducing most species of Carabidae, Linyphiidae and
   Lycosidae encountered and numbers in pitfall traps were reduced by an
   average of 74\%, 62\% and 77\% respectively. Similar reductions in
   densities of these taxa were found. Staphylinidae were less effected
   with an average reduction of only 32\% in pitfall traps, although
   Philonthus species were reduced by 82\%. Results were compared to

Abstract = {{Integrated conservation and development programs (ICDPs) are large,
   complex experiments in managing natural resources for both biodiversity
   and economic benefits. Monitoring should be an essential element within
   these programs to provide information for assessment and adaptive
   management; however, selecting appropriate indicators and designing
   effective monitoring programs is difficult due to thier complesity.
   Useful native plants can make excellent indicator species for ICDPs
   because monitoring them provides information simultaneously on both
   ecological and socioeconomic change. In addition, monitoring useful
   species is necessary for establishing management plans for their
   sustainable use. On the Masoala Peninsula in Madagascar, site of an
   ICDP, we conducted household surveys and developed new ethnobotanical
   indices from selecting the most important plant species in different use
   categories from 105 forest products harvested destructively by local
   inhabitants. Unlike previous studies, use categories were defined
   non-arbitrarily as groups of substitution products (e.g., products that
   are equivalent in their specific usage. By comparing use and preference
   within groups of substitution products, it is possible to predict
   over-extraction of preferred species and resource switching to secondary
   species. Knowledge of substitution groups is thus a necessary
   prerequisite for selecting indicator species that will furnish early
   warnings of non-sustainable use. We identified 13 groups of substitution
   products covering the major household uses on Masoala. From these we
   selected the 25 species that were most heavily used or preferred.
   Following the use of these species over time will permit a detailed
   spatial and temporal analysis of change sin resource use patterns and
   harvesting impacts in response to the integrated conservation and
   development program ultimately allowing the test of the hypothesis that
   economic development linked to conservation promotes conservation.}},

Abstract = {{A significant factor contributing to deforestation is the expanding
   human populations' increasing demands on forests and forest products. In
   many areas, rural households rely solely on fuelwood collected from the
   forest for their domestic energy supply. Fuel-saving stoves, or improved
   cook-stoves, have been introduced to reduce fuelwood consumption and
   thus alleviate deforestation, but there is frequently little or no
   formal monitoring and evaluation of programmes; their success as both a
   development and a resource-conservation tool is therefore undetermined.
   A programme was implemented in communities surrounding two national
   parks in western Uganda to compare: domestic fuelwood consumption of an
   improved cook-stove and the traditional cooking fire, and assess the
   attitudes of stove users and non-users towards the improved stove and
   resource conservation. A kitchen performance test conducted in 100
   households in Kiziba, Kahangi and Matayisa/Bundinyama parishes showed
   that fuelwood consumption did not differ significantly between improved
   and traditional stoves under actual field conditions. Household surveys
   showed that respondents in all three parishes had positive perceptions
   of the improved cook-stove. Perceived advantages of the improved stove
   included the ability to cook more than one item at once, fuelwood
   savings, quick cooking, and smoke/accident reduction. Many problems
   cited with the stove were technical, such as chimney malfunctions and
   pot-holes being too large or small to accommodate cooking pots. Cost of
   the stove was the primary reason for non-adoption. Improved-stove users
   were more concerned with forest conservation than were non-users. The
   need for monitoring and evaluation of improved-stove programmes is
   strongly indicated if they are to continue to be implemented as tools
   for resource conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The pecan weevil, Curculio caryae (Horn); can injure pecan from kernel
   initiation in August until dehiscence of the involucre 2-3 mo later.
   Prevention of injury requires killing adults after they emerge from soil
   cells but before they oviposit within developing nuts. The adult
   emergence period is typically from mid-August to late September, but a
   portion of the population can be delayed in emerging because of drought
   hardened soils. Emergence was delayed in this study when soil
   penetrability was >65 kg/cm(2). Soil penetrability as a function of
   percent soil moisture, clay, and sand can be predicted by the following
   equation: y = 137.713 - 8.965x(1) + 3.463x(2 )- 1.190x(3). Changes in
   soil penetrability caused by rainfall can be calculated by first
   determining the change in percent soil moisture as a function of percent
   soil moisture before rainfall, rainfall (centimeter), and percent sand:
   y = -18.358 - 0.607x(1) + 0.458x(2) + 2.342x(3) and then solving the
   previous equation with the new value to update the status of pecan
   weevil emergence. These findings can be combined with data on soils and
   new weather monitoring technologies like Doppler radar to predict weevil
   emergence status initially and then update that status across wide
   regions on a near real-time basis to aid in making decisions with regard
   to pecan weevil management. These predictions would be based on
   county-wide rainfall data and growers would need to take into account
   their own irrigation programs before making any decision regarding pecan
   weevil control.}},

Abstract = {{The pales weevil, Hylobius pales (Herbst), is a major regeneration pest
   of Christmas tree plantations in the eastern United States, where
   traditional control measures include the use of highly toxic
   insecticides. The development of an effective, easily implemented
   sampling strategy to detect when serious infestations are imminent is
   highly desirable for reducing these preventative insecticide
   applications. Methods were evaluated for trapping walking H. pales under
   3 vegetation management treatments in Christmas tree plantations and for
   their potential to forecast seedling damage. Standard pit traps baited
   with natural host material and synthetic volatiles caught significantly
   more a pales than polyvinylchloride (PVC) pitfall traps baited with
   synthetic volatiles alone. No gender differences were observed in
   response to the trap treatments. No differences in catch were observed
   between stationary traps and traps rotated biweekly to different
   locations within each plot. Vegetation management had no significant
   effect on trap catch. However, H. pales fed on a significantly higher
   proportion of eastern white pine seedlings, Pinus strobus L., in plots
   not managed for competing vegetation than in herbicide-treated plots.
   The data suggested a strong linear relationship between catch and
   seedling damage; these variables were significantly correlated in 1995,
   but not in 1994. However, one must be cautious because this regression
   was based solely on 4 data points. The seasonal occurrence of H. pales
   in Virginia Christmas tree plantations is reviewed in detail. Our
   results suggest we must rely on the use of pit traps for monitoring
   weevil populations in Virginia until an appropriate system for
   implementing the PVC pitfall trap is developed.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal dynamics of Daphnia populations vary regionally throughout
   the United States. Within the general pattern, Daphnia increase in
   abundance after the initiation of the spring algal bloom in all lakes,
   but their subsequent seasonal patterns differ in various climatic
   regions. Lakes in regions with cooler summers have large-bodied Daphnia
   populations that tend to persist throughout the summer, although the
   species dominance may shift. Regions with warmer summers tend to have
   large-bodied Daphnia populations that decline or are absent through much
   of the summer. Still warmer water bodies tend to have medium-to
   small-bodied species that are abundant during spring, but absent most of
   the summer. Many central Florida lakes lack Daphnia; if Daphnia species
   are present, they tend to be small-bodied. Daphnia abundance in these
   water bodies varies, but seems to be independent of temperature.
   If surface water (lake, pond) sampling is done in all regions during
   July and August, the impression will be that Daphnia are absent from
   large segments of the United States. This would be erroneous, because
   Daphnia are important earlier during the spring and early summer but are
   likely to be absent during midsummer in some U.S. regions. Year-to-year
   variation will be superimposed on this regional pattern. Because there
   are differences in the dates when spring and summer occur, it would be
   useful to have an index period that would standardize the start of the
   growing season. The use of the terrestrial onset of greenness, based on
   remote sensing of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, is
   suggested as a possible index set point.}},

Abstract = {{Generic techniques are widely applied to assess the effects of
   environmental variation or exogenous impacts on populations. Many
   studies Fail to provide convincing evidence that genetic patterns are
   attributable to the factors proposed. We assert that a rigorous approach
   must be followed to distinguish patterns of natural genetic variation
   from genetic change. We review the principles of natural generic
   variation and population structure and present them in the context of
   their interaction with biological and stochastic sources of genetic
   change. Key steps are articulated which are often overlooked when
   applying genetic techniques. These are consideration of population
   structure when comparing populations, developing a specific test against
   a model of genetic change, and testing for evidence of direct effects
   and mechanisms of impact. Use of these steps in genetic ecotoxicology is
   described in detail and includes three primary methods of linking
   genetic patterns to the effects of contaminants. We propose that this
   combined approach is critical to the use of genetic techniques to assess
   and predict lone-term effects of environmental impacts on populations or
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesized that natural selection reduces the ``genetic
   load{''} of deleterious alleles from populations that inbreed during
   bottlenecks, thereby ameliorating impacts of future inbreeding. We
   tested the efficiency with which natural selection purges deleterious
   alleles from three subspecies of Peromyscus polionotus during 10
   generations of laboratory inbreeding by monitoring pairing success,
   litter size, viability, and growth in 3604 litters produced from 3058
   pairs. In P. p. subgriseus, there was no reduction across generations in
   inbreeding depression in any of the fitness components. Strongly
   deleterious recessive alleles may have been removed previously during
   episodes of local inbreeding in the wild, and the residual genetic load
   in this population was not further reduced by selection in the lab. In
   P. p. rhoadsi, four of seven fitness components did show a reduction of
   the genetic load with continued inbreeding. The average reduction in the
   genetic load was as expected if inbreeding depression in this population
   is caused by highly deleterious recessive alleles that are efficiently
   removed by selection. For P. p. leucocephalus, a population that
   experiences periodic bottlenecks in the wild, the effect of further
   inbreeding in the laboratory was to exacerbate rather than reduce the
   genetic load. Recessive deleterious alleles may have been removed from
   this population during repeated bottlenecks in the wild; the population
   may be close to a threshold level of heterozygosity below which fitness
   declines rapidly. Thus, the effects of selection on inbreeding
   depression varied substantially among populations, perhaps due to
   different histories of inbreeding and selection.}},

Abstract = {{A broad-based public consensus has emerged that bycatch should be
   minimized to levels approaching insignificance. This view as reflected
   in U.S. and worldwide legislation and agreements, demonstrates the
   widely held belief that discarded portions of fishery catches (including
   economic resources, protected species, and unobserved mortalities of
   animals not caught) represent an unacceptable waste of natural
   resources. Bycatches in their various forms can have significant
   consequences for populations, food webs, and ecosystems. The economic
   effects of bycatches can influence not only the levels of yields to
   individual fisheries, but also may have major effects on allocations
   among competing fisheries. The lack of comprehensive monitoring programs
   in most areas to assess bycatches and integrate them into population and
   multispecies models seriously impedes a full understanding of bycatch
   consequences and the efficacy of measures for their amelioration.
   Nevertheless, where evidence for significant bycatches exists, a
   risk-averse and perhaps adaptive management philosophy is clearly
   warranted. Establishing the benefits and costs associated with bycatch
   management is a priority as managers attempt to define the practicality
   of bycatches approaching zero given the institutional, scientific, and
   industry resources necessary to accomplish the job.}},

Abstract = {{The present experiment was designed to examine the effect of transfer to
   clean pasture in mid-summer on trichostrongyle worm burdens in
   first-season grazing calves in Lithuania. Twenty heifer-calves aged 5-8
   months were turned out on a naturally contaminated pasture of 2 ha on 4
   June. On 18 July the experimental animals were divided into two
   comparable groups of 10 calves, balanced according to liveweight. Group
   B was moved to a 2 ha plot that had been used for hay production in the
   first part of the grazing season. Group A continued to graze on the
   initial plot. Every two weeks the heifers were weighed and clinically
   inspected, and faeces, blood and grass samples were collected. The
   infectivity of the pasture plots was monitored using parasite-naive
   tracer-calves that were introduced on two occasions, i. e. on 15 August
   and 3 October, respectively for a 2 week period. Excretion of
   trichostrongylid eggs and serum pepsinogen levels were higher in group
   A. Most of the nonmoved calves showed clinical signs of mild parasitic
   gastroenteritis from the beginning of August and onwards. Results from
   necropsied tracer-calves showed an increase in pasture infectivity on
   the plot grazed by group A. This study showed that trichostrongylid
   infections in cattle in Lithuania may be suppressed by moving animals to
   safe pasture in the middle of the summer.}},

Abstract = {{I present here methods for describing how spatial distribution changes
   as population abundance varies. Four models for biomass-dependent
   spatial dynamics are described and characterized by geostatistical
   aggregation curves. These curves provide a simple way to choose between
   models when characterizing spatio-temporal variability of survey data. A
   test of significance is proposed based on a bootstrap resampling
   algorithm. The analysis is applied to two spatio-temporal series of
   monitoring surveys; a groundfish bottom trawl survey and a pelagic
   echointegration survey. Relative to the population mean, the relative
   histograms in both series are time invariant for medium and high
   observed abundances. But for low population abundance, the relative
   histogram is more skewed. I then discuss the use of commercial CPUE data
   for deriving time series of comparable abundance indices when the
   density histogram changes with abundance.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance patterns of the two species of megrim. LL
   Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis and L.. boscii, in ICES Divisions VIIIc and
   IXa, were analysed using the data provided by bottom-trawl surveys and
   the Spanish fishing fleet in European Atlantic waters. The consistency
   of year-class strengths estimated over time from these surveys was taken
   as an indication of the reliability of the survey data to monitor megrim
   population abundance. Recruitment strength was, to a large extent, the
   main factor governing abundance found in successive years. This is due
   to the fact that the greater percentage of accessible biomass comprises
   1. 2 and 3-year-old individuals. Four spot megrim (L. boscii) is
   currently the most abundant species in this zone due to the weak
   recruitment of L.. ir pp in recent years. As a consequence of these
   species' sexual differences in growth. there is a predominance of
   females in the larger-sized individuals of the population. From 4 years
   onwards, males show a higher mortality rate than females.
   No evidence of geographical migrations was found, although a bathymetric
   expansion occurs with age: juveniles are more stenobathic than adults
   are. A degree of specialization can be observed in the two species'
   habitats, probably due to their different feeding systems, with L.
   whiffiagonis occupying shallower waters. Production statistics from the
   Spanish fishing fleet in the north-east Atlantic show a far wider
   distribution of L. boscii than was indicated by data available
   previously. (C) 1998 International Council for the Exploration of the

Abstract = {{Proximate and ultimate explanations of interactions between infants and
   nonmothers vary depending upon the relatedness of the interactors. We
   investigated interactions of infants and nonmothers from a 22-month
   continuous study and from the long-term monitoring of the mantled howler
   population of La Pacifica, Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. Relatedness
   is low or absent in these mantled howler groups. Juvenile females
   appeared to practice care skills with older infants, but as most first
   infants died, they failed to benefit. Infant positive interactions with
   adults occurred with the mother and probable father Other adult females
   behaved aggressively toward the youngest infants. Mothers were retentive
   of infants and responded negatively to these interactions, suggesting
   that they perceived them as threatening. Interactions with infants
   appear to reflect competition in groups of unrelated adults. A review of
   other populations of Alouatta palliata and other species of howlers
   indicate variability in social group size and suggest variability in
   intragroup relatedness. We suggest that further study will confirm that
   social behavior (including interactions with infants) will vary by
   resource availability (group size) and associated demographic patterns
   (male and female migration) that affect relatedness in howler social
   groups.}},

Title = {{Experimental refuges for migratory waterfowl in Danish wetlands. II.
   Tests of hunting disturbance effects}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{1. In most situations that have been studied, the creation of refuge
   areas for migratory waterfowl has generally increased the number of
   waterfowl using a site. However, experimental evidence to show that the
   increases were caused by reduced disturbance and not by confounding
   factors, e.g. improvement of habitat quality of the sites or general
   population increases, is generally lacking.
   2. In two Danish coastal wetlands, waterfowl hunting was the most
   critical source of disturbance to autumn-staging waterfowl (Madsen
   1998). To test whether hunting disturbance displaced birds from sites,
   experimental refuge areas were established, with hunting-free areas
   manipulated annually during a 4-year period, followed by permanent
   refuge establishments, monitored for a further 4 years.
   3. In both areas, experiments showed that quarry geese and dabbling
   ducks redistributed according to the position of the hunting-free areas,
   whereas protected species did not. In quarry geese, there was a 6-8-fold
   increase in numbers from before to after the experiments; in quarry
   dabbling ducks there was a 4-50-fold increase. Dabbling ducks extended
   the staging period into the winter. Protected waterfowl as well as
   goldeneye and coot (both quarry species) did not redistribute; their
   numbers either fluctuated or increased (2 to > 50 fold).
   4. In quarry geese and dabbling ducks, changes in food supplies (of the
   herbivorous species), intensities of recreational activities outside the
   refuge areas, weather or overall population sizes could not explain the
   increases. In protected species, as well as goldeneye and coot, trends
   in local numbers were in accordance with overall population trends for
   some species; in others, the rate of increase in local numbers was
   higher than in overall population size.
   5. In both areas, species richness increased from before to after the
   experiments. This was most pronounced in one of the areas where the
   refuge included shallow-watered areas in association with salt marshes.
   6. It is concluded that prior to experiments, waterfowl hunting caused a
   displacement of quarry species, resulting in a species-poor waterfowl
   community. Refuge creation is an efficient management tool to improve
   the conservation value and biodiversity of wetlands of importance to
   waterfowl.}},

   snails' Polynesian range, has led many species to extinction, and has
   resulted in the development of ex situ and in situ conservation efforts
   for the remaining species of the family Partulidae. Over a 10 year
   period the programme has moved from art emphasis on captive bleeding and
   rescue of doomed populations, to trial release programmes. In January
   1996 a total of 17 participating toes and universities in Europe and
   North America were maintaining over 30 partulid species and subspecies
   in culture, totalling over 14,000 snails. Target ex situ population
   sizes required to maintain 90\% of starting heterozygosity over 100
   years have been calculated. The conservation status of all 117 species
   of the Partulidae has been assessed using the Conservation Assessment
   Management Plan process. A relational database has been developed to
   support population analysis for management. The ability of long term
   captive-bred snails to readapt to natural field conditions was
   investigated using a trial release and monitoring experiment at Kew
   Gardens. Field release trials in a predator-proof forest reserve
   commenced in 1994 and continue to be assessed. Since its commencement in
   1986 the partulid conservation programme has experienced mixed results
   with both notable successes and failures. The programme provides
   conservationists with a model for developing future conservation
   programmes for other threatened mollusc species.}},

Abstract = {{Species work is undertaken by English Nature under four interelated
   headings: Wildlife \& Countryside Act, Habitats \& Species Directive,
   Biodiversity Action Plan and the Species Recovery Programme which
   focusses primarily on species listed in the schedules of the Wildlife \&
   Coutryside Act and, more recently, in the Biodiversity Action Plan. Over
   the past five years, nearly all the species listed in the `short list'
   of the Biodiversity Action Plan have received some attention through
   commissioned work. This paper describes current work on molluscs
   including action plans and assessment of the status and extent of known
   populations for Lauria sempronii, Pseudanodonta complanata, Segmentina
   nitida and Anisus vorticulus. Seven special areas of conservation have
   been recommended to the UK government, and another four will be
   submitted shortly for the Jive species of Molluscs on Annex II of the
   European Union Habitats \& Species Directive. Surveys have been
   undertaken to establish the boundaries of these areas for Vertigo
   moulinsiana and Margaritifera margaritifera. The Directive requires
   listed species to be monitored and work is progressing on a method for
   Vertigo angustior. Monitoring of Myxas glutinosa at its only known site
   under the species recovery programme was unsuccessful, so that proposed
   management has been postponed until it is clear that the snail still
   exists.}},

   within the route of a new road in southern England whilst site clearance
   was in progress, caused the urgent development of a strategy to protect
   the animals. The snail's inclusion on Annex II of the European Habitats
   \& Species Directive made it vital for appropriate action to be
   implemented to protect the snail along the proposed road. As it was not
   feasible to change the route it was decided to translocate the wetland
   habitat supporting the Vertigo moulinsiana populations to places
   off-route. As a further safeguard, new marsh habitat was created to
   provide the opportunity for V. moulinsiana colonisation. The methods of
   translocation and the subsequent monitoring programme are described.
   Early results indicate that the translocation of snail rich vegetation
   has been successful and that the snails are breeding.}},

Abstract = {{The refuge plus high-dose resistance management strategy for transgenic
   crops producing Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner crystal protein toxins
   (Bf crops) assumes that resistance is rare and functionally recessive.
   We propose an F-2 screening procedure to estimate the frequency of rare
   resistance alleles in natural insect populations and acquire them for
   Further testing. The procedure preserves genetic variation in isofemale
   lines and concentrates the resistance alleles in homozygous genotypes
   where they can be detected, whether they are recessive or dominant.
   Bayesian statistics for estimating allele frequency and credibility
   intervals, and the probability that the screen will not detect a
   resistance allele are derived. Compared with other methods for detecting
   and estimating resistance alleles, the F-2 screen will be efficient and
   accurate, extend the sensitivity of allele-frequency estimation for
   recessive traits by more than an order of magnitude compared with a
   discriminating-dose assay, and detect all resistance traits segregating
   in the initial sample of field-collected insects rather than a subset
   that responds most rapidly to laboratory selection.}},

Abstract = {{The systemic insecticide imidacloprid has been used successfully to
   manage Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Pet-ring and whitefly-borne
   geminivirus on tomato in south Florida and elsewhere. We evaluated plant
   and whitefly responses to imidacloprid in greenhouse grown tomato,
   Lycopersicon esculentum Miller, transplants and field-grown fresh market
   staked tomato. Seedlings in transplant trays treated with 1 or 2 mg (AI)
   per plant applied as a drench were protected from egg deposition for up
   to 6 wk of exposure to a greenhouse colony of whiteflies. In the field,
   either 280 or 560 g (AI)/ha of imidacloprid applied to the soil at
   transplanting provided protection from all whitefly stages and was
   better than or equal to protection obtained with weekly sprays of
   organophosphate/pyrethroid insecticide mixtures for up to 9 wk, Movement
   of geminivirus infection vectored by whitefly adults was suppressed in
   small plots, indicating that imidacloprid acted rapidly on adults.
   Treated tomato or eggplant, Solanum melongena L. `Black Beauty',
   functioned as trap crops by reducing whitefly numbers on adjacent
   untreated tomato. High application rates and persistence of imidacloprid
   have combined to increase the likelihood of insecticide resistance and
   to necessitate the development of an easily reproducible bioassay to
   facilitate monitoring. A leaf-dip bioassay indicated that the LC50 for
   10-d-old whitefly nymphs to imidacloprid was 6.1 mg (AI)/liter and the
   LC90 was 32.6 mg (AI)/liter. These results could serve as a baseline for
   whitefly susceptibility in south Florida, given the lack of any previous
   exposure to imidacloprid of the-tested population.}},

Abstract = {{Filter feeders are important components in coastal ecosystems where they
   remove suspended food particles from the water A key to the
   understanding of spatial and temporal variations in pelagic biomass is
   knowledge of the circumstances under which filter feeding takes place.
   Frequently changing salinities caused by water exchange between the
   highly saline North Sea and the brackish Baltic create density-driven
   currents that are of great importance not only for the extent of grazing
   impact exerted by benthic filter-feeding macroinvertebrates (e.g.
   bivalves, ascidians and polychaetes), but also for the performance of
   pelagic filter feeders such as jellyfish and their zooplankton prey
   organisms. There is good evidence that the feeding demands and
   effectiveness of filter feeders explain variations in plankton biomass.
   in a recent project the hydrodynamic conditions in a Danish fjord
   (Kerteminde Fjord/Kertinge Nor) were brought into focus where it was
   found that the interaction between hydraulic processes and
   filter-feeding organisms (ascidians and jellyfish) could explain
   otherwise unaccountably large variations in the phytoplankton biomass.
   The interaction between hydrography and filter feeders is typically
   overlooked although of great importance for marine monitoring programmes
   using parameters such as phytoplankton biomass routinely in the
   assessment of environmental conditions. (C) 1998 Academic Press.}},

   southeastern Colorado during the 1992 and 1993 breeding seasons in order
   to determine the possible impact of competition with European Starlings

   interactions during 418 hours of observation. Out of the 59 breeding
   Lewis' Woodpecker pairs observed, only one lost its nest cavity to
   starlings. Lewis' Woodpeckers were dominant in over 90\% of the
   interspecific interactions with European Starlings, and such
   interactions occurred infrequently (1.7 interactions/10 h of
   observation). The nesting phenologies of the two species overlapped
   minimally because Lewis' Woodpeckers initiated breeding approximately
   4-6 wk after European Starlings. These data suggest that, at least in
   southeastern Colorado, European Starlings are not major nest-cavity
   competitors of Lewis' Woodpeckers, and that widespread population
   declines observed in Lewis' Woodpeckers may be due to other factors.}},

Abstract = {{The pink-shrimp (Penaeus paulensis and P. brasiliensis) is the most
   important shellfish resource in southern Brazil. Highly unselective, the
   pink-shrimp trawl fishery produces an abundant and diverse by-catch that
   includes valuable and poorly known shellfish species. Landings of
   pink-shrimp trawlers in the Itajaf harbor (26 degrees S, southern
   Brazil) were monitored regularly from May 1995 to March 1997, to study
   temporal and spatial patterns of the catches of pink-shrimp and the
   squids, Loligo plei and L. sanpaulensis, the scallop, Pecten ziczac; the
   deep-sea lobster, Metanephrops rubellus; and the slipper lobster,
   Scyllarides depressus. Shrimp trawlers operated year round except for a
   period between March and part of May, when fishing is closed to protect
   shrimp recruitment periods. Trawling took place from southern Sao Paulo
   coast (23 degrees S) to northern Rio Grande do Sul (30 degrees S) at
   depths ranging from 14 to 120 m concentrating seasonally in six main
   fishing areas according to patterns of penaeid shrimp distribution. Such
   seasonal displacement determined the patterns of incidental exploitation
   of all shellfish species and has originated: (a) a directed scallop
   fisheries, whose uncontrolled effort lead to its collapse; and b) an
   emerging L. plei fishery stimulated by their massive seasonal presence
   in by-catch. The slipper lobster and the deep-sea lobster are potential

Journal = {{MARINE BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the reproductive cycle of Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis
   (OF Muller) between April 1993 and August 1995 in kelp beds, barren
   grounds and grazing fronts at both a wave-exposed and a sheltered site
   along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. Gonad index and histological
   analyses showed that S. droebachiensis has an annual reproductive cycle
   that is synchronous across sites and habitats, and between Females and
   males. Spawning occurs in March/April of each year but a small
   proportion of sea urchins in the study populations also spawned in fall
   1995. During most of the year, sea. urchins in kelp beds and grazing
   fronts have a higher gonad index than those in barren grounds. Gonad
   indices also tended to be higher at the wave-exposed than the sheltered
   site. Interannual variability in peak gonad index was significant in the
   barren grounds at the wave-exposed site and in the grazing front at the
   sheltered site. The gametogenic cycle is characterized by six stapes
   based on the abundance of nutritive and germinal:gametic cells.
   Nutritive phagocytes are abundant Lifter spawning and replaced by
   increasing numbers of germinal and gametic cells as the gametogenic
   cycle progresses. The temporal patterns of abundance of each cell type
   were similar among habitats indicating that the gonads were
   qualitatively similar despite large differences in gonadal mass. The
   quantity of gut contents (ratio of food volume to body volume) was
   similar among habitats, but the quality (percentage of organic material)
   tended to be higher in kelp beds and grazing fronts than in barren
   grounds suggesting that differences in gonad index of S. droebachiensis
   in different habitats are related to differences in diet. The high
   density of sea urchins in grazing fronts combined with their high
   fecundity suggests that they make the greatest contribution, per unit
   area, to the overall larval pool.}},

Abstract = {{Local patterns of adult distribution in organisms that disperse young as
   pelagic larvae can be determined at the time of recruitment through
   habitat selection or, shortly thereafter, through post-recruitment
   processes such as differential juvenile survivorship and interspecific
   competition. This study addresses the importance of habitat selection by
   recruits in establishing the local pattern of adult distribution in two
   sympatric Caribbean damselfish species, Stegastes dorsopunicans and S.
   planifrons. Both species inhabit shallow reefs but show little overlap
   in their distribution; S. dorsopunicans predominates in the reef crest
   and S. planifrons occurs primarily on the reef slope. Furthermore, S.
   dorsopunicans is associated with rocky substrate, while S. planifrons
   occupies live coral. The substrate cover follows a similar pattern with
   coral being much less common on the reef crest than on the reef slope.
   Monitoring recruitment every other day in reciprocal removal experiments
   and artificial reefs indicates that the observed pattern of local adult
   distribution is a product of habitat selection for both species. The
   presence or absence of conspecifics did not influence recruitment
   patterns for either species. Stegastes dorsopunicans recruited primarily
   to shallow, rocky areas, appearing to cue on both substratum type and
   depth. Stegastes planifrons recruited exclusively to coral substratum
   independent of depth. These results indicate that local adult patterns
   of distribution can be explained by habitat selection at recruitment,
   and that substrate type and depth may be important cues.}},

Abstract = {{Permethrin carboxylesterases (e.g., pI 4.2-4.8 CbEs) have been purified
   from the hemolymph of a permethrin-resistant strain of Colorado potato
   beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, through several chromatographic
   procedures in order to determine those proteins most responsible for the
   DEF-synergized aspect of resistance. The pI 4.8 CbE is a 46- to 48-kDa
   monomeric protein whereas the pI 4.5 CbE appears to be a 57- to 59-kDa
   dimeric protein. Both the pI 4.8 CbE and the pI 4.5 CbE are, in fact
   composed of groups of multiple-charged forms. All pI 4.5-4.8 CbEs are
   glycoproteins bur the charge heterogeneity is not associated with
   N-glycan moieties. A consistent tendency of increasing affinities for
   the pI 4.2-4.8 CbEs as the hydrophobicity of naphthyl substrate
   increased implicates that the catalytic sites of all the pI CbEs have
   hydrophobic properties. The hydrophobic catalytic site, however, is
   separate entity from the domain determining overall surface
   hydrophobicity of CbE as determined by hydrophobic
   interaction:chromatography of the purified pI 4.5-4.8 CbEs. Overall, pI
   4.8 CbE possessed the highest affinity and catalytic efficiency for all
   three naphthyl substrates tested and for permethrin. The hydrolysis
   rates for permethrin, however, were extremely low compared to those of
   the naphthyl substrates. Nevertheless, the over production and the high
   affinity toward hydrophobic substrates of the permethrin CbE in the
   hemolymph in the permethrin-resistant strain of Colorado potato beetle
   is likely to result in efficient hydrolysis of permethrin. In general,
   the PI 4.8 and 4.5 CbEs share a number of similarities in their
   biochemical properties;ind functional role in permethrin resistance
   despite their distinct molecular properties. The availability of highly
   purified and characterized forms of permethrin CbE will allow the
   development of efficient immunochemical and DNA-based diagnostics for
   the monitoring of permethrin resistance in field populations of beetles.

Abstract = {{It is generally believed that Verticillium moves slowly up a plant
   through spore trapping sites in the vascular tissue in a stepwise
   fashion. In a resistant plant, rapid defence responses around these
   sites slow pathogen growth and often restrict the fungus to the root and
   stem base. In a susceptible plant, the fungus escapes and eventually
   proliferates logarithmically in the upper stem and leaves. In the
   present study Craigella tomatoes were infected with Verticillium
   albo-atrum. Amounts of pathogen were monitored in the upper stems by a
   PCR-based quantitative assay and S-1 nuclease protection was used to
   study expression of a fungal induced phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene
   (tPAL5) during a 2-21 day time course. Even in resistant plants fungal
   colonization and PAL gene expression were found to be fully systemic
   from the earliest sporulation events (i.e. 2-4 days post-inoculation)
   and to occur in cycles, the PAL gene cycle following the colonization
   cycle. Peaks of pathogen growth occurred at 2-4 days and 12-15 days,
   succeeded by intermittent periods of fungal elimination. The results
   indicated that wilt is more systemic and also more dynamic in terms of
   fungal population fluctuations than previously thought (C) 1998 Academic

Abstract = {{Growth, phenology, survivorship, and seed production were observed in a
   population of a desert annual, Blepharis sindica, with reference to the
   variation in the timing of seedling emergence. The population consisted
   of several cohorts induced by rain-cued seed release within a growing
   season. The fate of 100 individuals of six cohorts was monitored
   throughout the growing season. Earlier-established cohorts had
   significantly larger plant sizes and higher reproductive outputs than
   later cohorts. The time and duration of each phenological stage varied
   among the cohorts, and they were also influenced by plant size.
   Mortalities at the seedling stage, vegetative stage, and reproductive
   stage increased with the delay of seed release. Seed release was
   concentrated in the early growing season. Fecundity was highest in the
   earliest cohort and decreased monotonically in later cohorts. The
   results suggested that even in temporally varying environments, the
   superiority of early emergent plants was evident. The seed release
   patterns in temporally fluctuating desert environments are discussed as
   a compromise between `diversified bet-hedging' and an optimal timing for
   maximizing the reproductive success in a growing season.}},

Abstract = {{Large numbers of genes are being discovered on a daily basis for a
   variety of organisms including Arabidopsis thaliana. To obtain more
   functional information on these genes, efficient expression monitoring
   methods need to be developed. In this report we studied the steady-state
   mRNA levels of over 800 Arabidopsis genes in parallel using high-density
   arrays of partially sequenced cDNA. The technology is simple and robust
   and reliably permits the detection of down to twofold variation in mRNA
   levels. The detection limit lies below 0.01\% of the total mRNA
   population. The comparison of the profiles obtained for light-grown and
   dark-grown seedlings revealed significant variations in mRNA levels for
   about 16\% of the cDNA investigated. This technology not only provides
   new functional information on anonymous genes, and thus may guide
   reverse-genetics approaches, but also constitutes a powerful tool for
   global gene expression studies, with many potential applications in
   plant biology.}},

Abstract = {{The biology of the gray-sided vole Clethrionomys rufocanus in Hokkaido,
   concerning taxonomy, morphology, phylogeny, distribution, and natural
   history, is reviewed. Applied issues in forest management (damage,
   control and census) are also mentioned. Although Clethrionomys rufocanus
   of Hokkaido was originally identified as a distinct species, Evotomys
   (=now Clethrionomys) bedfordiae Thomas, 1905, current literature
   generally refers to the gray-sided vole of Hokkaido as Clethrionomys
   rufocanus or as C. rufocanus bedfordiae (vernacular name, the Bedford's
   red-backed vole). The gray-sided vole is the most common small mammal in
   Hokkaido. It inhabits open areas as well as forests, and mainly feeds on
   green plants. The gray-sided vole has a high reproductive potential;
   litter size: 4-7; gestation period: 18-19 days; maturation age: 30-60
   days old. Although spring-born individuals usually attain sexual
   maturity in their summer/fall of birth, their maturation is sometimes
   suppressed under high densities. The breeding season is generally from
   April to October, but with some regional variation. Clethrionomys
   rufocanus has a rather specialized diet (folivorous), particularly
   during winter when it feeds on bamboo grass. Many predators specialize
   on the grey-sided vole in Hokkaido; even the red fox, which is a typical
   generalist predator, selectively feeds on this vole. Damage by voles'
   eating bark used to be sever on forest plantations in Hokkaido. Censuses
   of small rodents have been carried out for management purpose since
   1954.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of social groups of a roan antelope population was
   monitored once a month over a period of two years. Differences in
   habitat selection between seasons and between social groups were tested
   with the Chi-square test and correspondence analysis. The Aristida
   bipartita - Setaria sphacelata Grassland Variation, Tristachya rehmannii
   - Digitaria monodactyla Variation (adjacent to the Burkea Savanna), the
   eastern pocket of the Rhus leptodictya - Combretum apiculatum Variation
   and to some extent the Eragrostis nindensis - Digitaria monodactyla
   Variation were selected by the breeding herd during winter. In summer
   the most selected areas for the breeding herd were the lower floodplain
   and the Eragrostis pallens - Burkea africana Savanna (eastern section).
   Bachelor males were spatially segregated from the breeding herds, where
   they selected the Cymbopogon plurinodis - Combretum apiculatum Variation
   and the floodplain during winter, In summer males selected the
   floodplain. Newly burnt areas were attractive for roan antelope. However
   similar spatial segregations between social groups as found in non-burnt
   areas could still be observed in newly burnt areas.}},

Abstract = {{From 1993-1995, we located and monitored 601 Acadian Flycatcher
   (Empidonax virescens) nests in a large contiguous tract of bottomland
   hardwood forest on the White River National Wildlife Refuge, Arkansas.
   Annual reproductive success was significantly different among years;
   ranging from 10-25\% (Mayfield estimate) over the three years of the
   study. There was no significant difference in nest success among study
   plots, with nesting success showing a trend of increasing late in the
   breeding season. Clutch size for nonparasitized nests averaged 2.9 +/-
   0.02 (SE) eggs with a mode of 3. Rates of Brown-headed Cowbird
   (Molothrus ater) parasitism were low (21\%), accounting for 7\% of all
   nest failures. However, parasitism by cowbirds resulted in a reduction
   of clutch size for nests initiated early (i.e., first nests and
   replacements) in the breeding season. Predation was the leading cause of
   nest failures, accounting for 75\% of all failures. Snakes and avian
   predators were thought to be the leading cause of nest failures.
   Although additional factors must be investigated, preliminary results
   indicate that nest predation is a major influence on this population,
   despite the size of the forest tract.}},

Abstract = {{Green spruce aphid (Elatobium abietinum) is the main defoliator of Sitka
   spruce in the UK, but there is a lack of quantitative data on its
   effects on tree growth which can be used to predict its impact on
   current and future timber yields. Consequently, in 1992, the UK Forestry
   Commission set up a long-term field experiment in Hafren Forest, Wales,
   to determine the effects of E. abietinum, and root aphids (Pachypappa
   and Pachypappella spp.), on the growth of young Sitka spruce
   plantations. The experiment included four treatments in which natural
   populations of E. abietinum and root aphids were maintained or were
   excluded by insecticides, and a fifth treatment in which E. abietinum
   densities were raised artificially. Natural aphid populations were low
   during 1992-1995, precluding analysis of the impact of root aphids, but
   E. abietinum in the enhanced population treatment reached, in June 1994,
   densities equivalent to a moderate-severe natural outbreak (35-90
   aphids.100 needles(-1) on upper shoots). Needle fall was strongly
   correlated with E. abietinum density and the heavily infested trees
   lost, on average, 38.5\% of their older (1991-1993) needles. This was
   associated with a 22-23\% reduction in leader length in 1994 and a
   11-13\% reduction in tree height. Aphids and defoliation were
   concentrated at the tops of the trees and decreased toward the bases,
   and a similar pattern was observed in relative reductions in shoot
   growth. This suggested a local influence of aphids or defoliation on
   shoot growth within the canopy, but such effects could not be
   distinguished from a response of the trees to the overall rate of
   damage. Changes in needle size following infestation were not correlated
   with shoot growth and indicated a differential effect of aphid
   infestation on shoot and needle development. Continued monitoring of the
   experiment over the next 2-3 yr should reveal whether further,
   longer-term changes in shoot and needle production contribute to the
   restoration of normal tree growth. Crown copyright (C) 1998 Published by

   separate components (i.e., estimated age classes) using the
   log-differences method. Each year's sample was composed of two juvenile
   age classes plus a mixed component in which large immature individuals
   and sexually mature salamanders were present. The analysis of removal
   data showed that capture probabilities were homogeneous within each
   annual sampling and were similar between juveniles and adults (mean
   values being 0.33 and 0.26, respectively). The population density varied
   between 0.6 and 1.0 individuals/m(2) of rock face (average 0.8) and
   biomass, expressed as wet weight, between 0.98 and 1.54 g/m(2) (average
   1.25 g/m(2)). Temporary removal sampling was effective in providing
   autoecological data on European plethodontid salamanders living in such
   relatively complex microhabitats as vertical rock faces. Moreover, the
   results suggest that temporary removal methods can be a useful tool in
   monitoring amphibian long-term population changes.}},

Abstract = {{. The lowland calcareous grasslands of northwestern Europe are highly
   prized by ecologists and conservationists as a result of the diversity
   of their plant and invertebrate communities. Large areas of such
   grasslands have been lost this century as a result of changes in
   agricultural land use. Recent changes in agricultural policies, in
   particular the introduction of agri-environmental incentive schemes,
   have resulted in an increasing area being managed for the restoration of
   these communities. This paper reviews the management techniques employed
   in the restoration of lowland calcareous grasslands and the factors that
   govern their success. Constraints on the enhancement of the plant
   diversity of restoration sites include high soil fertility and the
   presence of undesirable species in the soil seed bank. However, it is
   thought that the primary constraint is the availability of propagules
   from which new populations can be established. Similarly, the dispersal
   mode and ability of insect species is likely to be the major factor
   limiting the enhancement of insect diversity. Evaluation of the success
   of restoration management usually involves monitoring changes in the
   plant community. However, as a result of their short life-cycles and
   sensitivity to small-scale environmental conditions, insects may respond
   more rapidly to changes resulting from restoration management and
   therefore provide better indicators of success. With the exception of a
   few high-profile butterfly species, the use of insects as indicator taxa
   has largely been neglected in terrestrial systems. This paper
   illustrates their potential use with reference to lowland calcareous
   grasslands in southern Britain.}},

Abstract = {{Severe mortalities due to luminescent vibrios occurred in pond-cultured
   Penaeus monodon juveniles particularly in the first 45 days of culture.
   Luminescent vibriosis epizootics led to reduced shrimp production due to
   mortalities and slow growth of affected stocks. Monitoring of bacterial
   population in the rearing water of several ponds was conducted from the
   time the ponds were flooded with water until 60 days of culture to
   understand the course of infection. Results showed that the occurrence
   of mortalities was preceded by a shift of the bacterial profile of the
   rearing water in infected ponds, notably the dominance of luminescent
   vibrios. Comparison of bacterial load in the rearing water and water
   source (river or open sea) showed elevated luminescent Vibrio counts in
   the former at 12 days to 3 weeks after initial entry of water.
   Histopathology of affected shrimps showed the hepatopancreas as the
   target organ of infection where severe inflammatory responses in the
   intertubular sinuses were seen. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   Idwal has a small but precipitous catchment with relatively large areas
   of heathland and base rich bare rock. Cwellyn has a larger catchment
   with a substantial proportion of woodland, including coniferous
   plantations, and a long history of human activity.
   2. The chemistry of the waters in both lakes is indicative of
   nutrient-poor conditions but Idwal exhibits relatively high alkalinity
   and pH values.
   3. The diatom floras are typical of nutrient-poor upland waters, with
   species composition reflecting the alkalinity differences. Isoetids form
   a dominant component of the macrophyte floras, with the most diverse
   assemblage recorded at Idwal.
   4. The zooplankton communities are distinctive, with only a small number
   of species occurring in both lakes. The macroinvertebrate faunas are
   dominated by insect taxa typical of stony shores. Supplementary stocking
   of the Idwal trout population has been reported.
   5. The conservation importance of the sites lies primarily in their
   representation of nutrient-poor mountain lake systems and the macrophyte
   assemblages which include a number of rare species. In addition, a
   genetically unique arctic charr population is present in Cwellyn.
   6. Impoundment, water abstraction, acidification, eutrophication and the
   recreational use of the sites are identified as potential environmental
   impacts. The conservation management of the sites is related to the
   extent of the reserve boundaries and catchment activities. Aspects of
   the future management and environmental monitoring of Idwal and Cwellyn
   as Special Areas of Conservation under the European Community Council
   Directive on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and
   flora are discussed. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The mink (Mustela vison) is a top trophic level species that readily
   bioaccumulates environmental pollutants and is considered to be a
   sensitive indicator of ecosystem health. Spatial trends in levels of
   organochlorine and heavy metal contaminant burdens were determined from
   1991 to 1995 for wild mink from western Northwest Territories (NWT),
   Canada. Tissue samples from 207 mink from seven communities were
   analyzed for residues of 63 organochlorines and 10 heavy metals. All
   groups of organochlorines were detected in mink livers at relatively low
   levels; maximum community means were 9.52 ng/g Sigma DDT and 73.07 ng/g
   Sigma PCB (sum of 43 congeners). There was a general trend of decreasing
   organochlorine burdens along a northerly or westerly gradient for some
   groups of compounds, primarily Sigma DDT, Sigma PCB, Sigma chlordane and
   dieldrin. Toxic equivalents (TEQs) of mink liver tissue were low, with
   the maximum community mean of 0.28 pg/g wet weight (5.5 pg/g lipid
   weight). Levels of heavy metal burdens in liver and kidney tissues were
   found to be relatively low, with the exception of Hg, which was found at
   moderate levels. There was no obvious geographic trend to the pattern of
   heavy metal burdens. The available evidence suggests that long-range
   atmospheric transport is the main source of the organochlorine
   contaminants observed. Local conditions (geology, water and soil
   chemistry, diet, etc.) may determine heavy metal burdens. Levels of
   contaminants in NWT mink appear to be one to two orders of magnitude
   lower than levels observed to cause reproductive impairment, reduced
   survival of kits, or lethality in adult mink. In the western NWT mink
   may be the best indicator to assess trends in environmental contaminants
   and ecosystem health; periodic monitoring is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Incidental mortality in gillnets is probably the most serious global
   threat to dolphin and porpoise populations. In 1994, a well-designed
   study demonstrated a 92\% reduction in bycatch of harbour porpoises in
   sink gillnets equipped with acoustic pingers. This result has not yet
   been fully replicated; in the New Hampshire area where the experiment
   was conducted or elsewhere. Statistical po,ver analyses indicate that
   such studies are feasible only in areas of high entanglement rate.
   Currently unanswered research questions include whether the 1994 results
   can be replicated, whether habituation might decrease effectiveness over
   time, and what the mechanism of deterrence is. Practical constraints
   include the size, cost and battery life of current pingers, and whether
   their rue could be monitored cost-effectively. Front a management
   perspective, even if the effectiveness of pingers is confirmed,
   widespread incorporation of them into gillnets may not alone be
   sufficient to meet the requirements of the US Marine Mammal Protection
   Act. For this reason scientists, managers and fishers must continue to
   explore other options, including time/area closures and encouragement of
   more selective fishing methods. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Populations of whiteflies {[}Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) sl.] and the
   rates at which they were parasitized in cotton fields in Israel and
   California were monitored over a number of years. Studies took place
   both in fields that were treated with insecticides and in untreated
   fields and permitted us to assess the influence of insecticidal
   treatments upon percentage parasitism. The results showed that, in many
   cases, insecticide treatments had only a minor effect on levels of
   parasitism and that high levels of parasitism were sustained in
   insecticide-treated fields. However, many repeated treatments,
   especially if monocrotophos was used, resulted in significant reductions
   in levels of parasitism in Israel. Our findings suggest that the species
   of parasitoids we observed may be no more severely impacted by certain
   insecticides than nymphal whiteflies that serve as hosts. Nonetheless,
   reductions in parasitoid abundance may have important consequences for
   the biological control of B. tabaci over time and over larger areas, and
   judicious use of insecticides in commercial cotton fields is warranted.

   Overall productivity of the population did not change during the study
   period, although the wet weight increased significantly with depth. The
   species showed winter peaks in reproductive activity, whereas in summer
   the frequency of reproductive plants was near zero. Throughout the study
   period the tetrasporic phase predominated over gametophytic phases.
   The non-fibrillar polysaccharides of Rhodymenia howeana were evaluated
   seasonally. Samples were sequentially extracted with water, acid and
   alkaline solutions and the extracts analysed by total hydrolysis,
   gas-liquid chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. The total yield of
   the extracts was 5.3\% in winter, while in spring and summer values were
   close to 30\%. The highest yields were obtained in aqueous and alkaline
   media and correspond mainly to a polysaccharide mixture of a sulphated
   galactan type and neutral glucans.}},

Abstract = {{The bertha armyworm has been recognized as an agricultural pest in
   western Canada for more than 85 years, during which time outbreaks have
   occurred at irregular intervals. The first major outbreak occurred in
   Saskatchewan in 1944 on the new crop, rapeseed. The development of
   canola as a major crop led to a dramatic increase in the economic damage
   caused by the bertha armyworm and resulted in the widespread use of
   insecticides for control. Discovery of a species-specific pheromone and
   development of an adult monitoring system in the late 1970s and early
   1980s led to a method for providing producers with early warning of
   potential for crop damage. In parallel, methods for estimating larval
   populations were developed but are in need of improvement. Refinement of
   these methods has the potential to provide a more accurate indication of
   damage risk for producers of canola. Control of bertha armyworm relies
   heavily on the use of chemical insecticides, emphasizing the need for
   development of integrated management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Field tests were conducted in an argan forest in Morocco to evaluate the
   performance of a cylindrical dry trap and food-based synthetic
   attractant (FA) for monitoring the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly),
   Ceratitis capitata (Weidemann). This female-targeted trapping system was
   compared with Jackson traps-baited with trimedlure (TML), a
   male-targeted trapping system. TML-baited traps attracted significantly
   more males than FA-baited traps (91.4 +/- 13.01 and 5.0 +/- 0.75 marks,
   respectively), and the FA-baited traps captured significantly more
   females than did TML-baited traps (9.3 +/- 1.93 and 0.1 +/- 0.04
   females, respectively). For the first month of the field trial, the
   ratio of mature females to immature females captured in the FA-baited
   traps was approximately equal, but more immature females were captured
   in the second month. FA-baited traps were less specific and captured
   significantly more nontarget flies than did TML-baited traps.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of harvesting on seed bank dynamics in a boreal mixedwood
   forest were studied on replicated 10-ha treatment blocks harvested by
   different clear-cutting or partial-cutting systems in the fall of 1993.
   From 1994 to 1995 we monitored seed rain, soil seed banks, and seasonal
   changes in species composition in understory vegetation and seed banks
   in all harvest blocks plus three uncut controls. No persistent conifers
   were found in the soil seed banks of any treatment. The number of seeds
   of other species generally decreased with soil depth in all treatments,
   with the lower layer of organic soil yielding the highest numbers of
   seedlings. Many seeds of sedges and some herbs were found in the upper
   mineral soil horizon, indicating significant longevity. While
   disturbance by harvesting operations altered the distribution of seeds
   in the soil profile, harvesting method had little effect on the total
   number of species present in post-harvest seed banks or understory
   vegetation. There were no differences in seasonal compositional changes
   between treatments. Seed rain monitoring indicated that few conifer
   seeds were added to the seed bank. Betula papyrifera Marsh. was the
   dominant tree species in seed rain in the partial cutting treatments.
   However, in the second post-harvest year on clear cut sites sedges and
   grasses increased from less than 1 to 14\% of seed rain. The results
   suggest that predominantly hardwood stands with prolific understory
   vegetation will initially develop on the treated sites, with a variable,
   but depleted conifer content.}},

Abstract = {{Multimedia box models of contaminant fate in a regional environment
   generate estimates of average atmospheric concentrations, ie. the total
   mass of substance in a defined volume. In this study the issue of
   estimating the distribution of concentrations, ie. spatial variability,
   consistent with the estimated average, is addressed. Simulations show
   that the distribution depends on the number and location of emission
   points, the local atmospheric dispersion or diffusion characteristics
   and the rate of chemical removal by reaction and irreversible
   deposition. The form of a correlating equation is suggested to relate
   these quantities to the relative standard deviation and the spread
   factor in the Weibull distribution, the latter being preferred for this
   analysis. Analysis of monitoring data for volatile organic chemicals
   (VOCs) in Ontario suggests that the value of the Weibull spread factor
   is predictable (with error limits), thus enabling average concentrations
   to be expressed also as approximate spatial distributions. It is also
   shown that spatial distributions differ depending on whether they are
   expressed on a sampling site, area, or population basis. Implications
   for analysis of data generated by multimedia box models to yield
   distributions and hence estimates of fractions of the environment
   exceeding specified exposure concentrations are discussed. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Laboratory incubation of eggs and histology of gonads indicated that the
   pivotal temperature for leatherback turtles nesting on the Pacific coast
   of Costa Pica at Playa Grande was 29.4 C and not biologically different
   from that determined for Atlantic leatherbacks. We calculated sex ratios
   of leatherback hatchlings by monitoring beach and nest temperatures for
   eight thermal profiles and 47 nests during the 1994-1995 nesting season.
   Leatherbacks at Plays Grande nest mainly in the open beach zone
   (86.8-90.0\%) and in the middle beach section (68.6-80.9\%). Sand
   temperature increased as the nesting season progressed and reached 30.0
   C (100\% female) by the middle of November. Monitored nests that
   produced hatchlings had temperatures above 30.0 C during the critical
   sex determining period. The sex of all hatchlings determined by gonad
   histology for 18 monitored nests (n = 10-20 per nest) were 100\% female.
   Estimated sex ratio for the 1993-1994 season was Oro male:100\% female,
   for the 1994-1995 nesting season was 6.5\% male:93.5\% female, and for
   the 1995-1996 season was 25.7\% male:74.3\% female. These ratios were
   more female biased than sex ratios reported for the past 25 years in
   Suriname on the Atlantic coast of South America. Gene flow between
   populations and the response of leatherback populations to thermally
   different nesting areas may be responsible for the lack of intraspecific
   variation in pivotal temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in forest resources have been estimated in a variety of ways.
   This paper focuses on extensive forest surveys rather than on
   sentinel-site investigations. The sampling design and plot design used
   are key to precise estimates of change. Alternative sampling designs
   include temporary surveys, Continuous Forest Inventory, and Sampling
   with Partial Replacement. Each can be used in conjunction with
   stratified sampling or double sampling for stratification. Plot designs
   can involve variable-radius or Bitterlich sampling for trees, and
   fixed-area plots for most attributes. In extensive surveys, it is
   efficient to group plots into clusters. Plots must be sampled at a
   frequency that is commensurate with the rate of change, degree of
   interest, and funding available. Often, plots are less than a hectare in
   size and spaced widely across the population. Continuous Forest
   Inventory, with or without stratification, is efficient for estimating
   current values, net change, and components of change. Much work remains
   in scaling to understand landscape-level interactions and to identify
   stressors and indicators of forest health and sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Federal agencies, policy makers, and scientists have long been
   interested in monitoring natural resources and environmental conditions
   on a national and regional scale. One of the main objectives of these
   studies is to estimate temporal changes in the extent and condition of
   natural resources. In its simplest form, temporal change can be defined
   as the difference between population parameter values at two time points
   for a given population. A more complex investigation of change in an
   ecological system involves studying the underlying dynamics that produce
   an observed net change. We discuss the general problem of sample design
   and statistical estimation to support investigations of the dynamics of
   change in ecological systems, particularly when a limited number of
   temporal observations are available. We focus on large-scale natural
   resource monitoring surveys through the example provided by the National
   Resources Inventory (NRI), a longitudinal survey conducted by the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture (USDA). Sample design, data collection, and
   statistical methods for constructing an accessible database are
   outlined, with emphasis on features that support investigations
   concerned with temporal dynamics. An example from the 1992 NRI is
   presented to illustrate methods for investigating temporal changes in
   land use in relation to observed changes in erosion rates over time.
   Finally, we discuss how statistical methods developed for the NRI
   program can be applied more broadly to environmental monitoring studies.}},

Abstract = {{For birds and many other animal taxa, surveys that collect count data
   form a primary source of information on population change. Because
   counts are only indices to population size, care must be taken in using
   them in analyses of population change. Temporal or geographic
   differences in the proportion of animals counted can be misinterpreted
   as differences in population size. Therefore, temporally or
   geographically varying factors that influence the proportion of animals
   counted must be incorporated as covariables in the analysis of
   population parameters from count data. We describe the North American
   Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) for illustration. The BBS is a major,
   landscape-level survey of birds in North America; it is typical of many
   count surveys, in that the same sample units (survey routes) are sampled
   each year, and change is modeled on these routes over time. We identify
   covariables related to observer ability, the omission of which can bias
   estimation of population change from BBS data. Controlling for observer
   effects or other potential sources of confounding requires the
   specification of models relating counts to population size. We begin
   with a partial model specification relating expected counts to
   population sizes; we describe estimators currently in use in relation to
   this partial specification. Additional assumptions lead to a class of
   overdispersed multinomial models, for which we describe estimators of
   population change and procedures for parsimonious model selection. We
   illustrate the use of overdispersed multinomial models by an application
   to data for Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus).}},

Abstract = {{In the sentinel-site approach to monitoring ecological resources,
   relatively small numbers of locations are chosen for intensive study,
   each location being selected to represent a certain, preferably large,
   class of ecosystems. This paper examines long-term studies at three
   inland aquatic ecosystems in California that, although never intended as
   sentinel sites, nevertheless illustrate the challenges posed by
   sentinel-site networks. The main mechanisms of interannual variability
   in primary productivity or producers are described for Castle Lake, Lake
   Tahoe, and northern San Francisco Bay. The external forces behind the
   variability include climate (in the form of both snowfall and total
   precipitation), fishing intensity, anthropogenic nitrogen emissions,
   spring weather systems, intrinsic population cycles, forest fires, water
   diversions, and invasions of exotics. Each mechanism is associated with
   certain critical ecosystem features (such as hydraulic residence time)
   that condition a responsiveness to one or a combination of these
   external forces (such as precipitation); these critical features are
   identified for each mechanism. Three demanding conditions must be
   fulfilled in order for a sentinel site to function with regard to a
   given stressor: (1) some subset of the network must encounter the
   stressor; (2) at least some sites in the subset must have the critical
   features that cause responsiveness to that stressor; and (3) the
   background variability at those sites must not disguise the response to
   the stressor of interest. In practice, reliable extrapolation from
   sentinel-site networks to regional trends appears to be beyond our
   ecological understanding at the present time.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of trends in ecosystems depends upon (1) a good
   description of the foundation or benchmark against which changes are
   measured and (2) a distinction between natural and anthropogenic
   changes. Patterns and mechanisms observed over 25 years in a large kelp
   forest suggest that definition of a meaningful benchmark is impossible,
   because many of the large animals have been gone for years to decades,
   and kelps are sensitive to large-scale, low-frequency El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation events and longer term regime shifts. A shift in the
   oceanographic climate has significantly reduced the average size and
   carrying capacity of the dominant plant. The animals that have been
   functionally removed from the community include sea otters, black sea
   bass, yellowtail, white sea bass, and abalones. Other species are still
   present, but fisheries have had huge effects on the abundances,
   size-frequencies, and/or spatial distributions of sheephead, kelp bass,
   rays, flatfish, rock fish, spiny lobsters, and red sea urchins. Now even
   sea cucumbers, crabs, and small snails are subject to unregulated
   fishing. The plants continue to exist without a hint of the effects of
   the loss of so much animal biomass. Furthermore, most of the megafauna
   have been removed with very little documentation or historical
   understanding of what the natural community was like. Thus, our ability
   to separate anthropogenic impacts from the ``natural{''} dynamics of the
   system is severely compromised. We discuss the importance of both an
   ecosystem focus on productivity and careful monitoring of as many
   populations as possible. In addition, we show that this community is not
   tightly integrated with mutual dependencies; hence, many species can be
   removed without much affecting the rest of the ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale experiments about the effect of disease on wildlife
   populations are rare. We examined (1) whether the prevalence of canine
   distemper (CD) could be reduced in urban raccoons (Procyon lotor) using
   held vaccination and (2) the extent to which CD might limit raccoon
   populations. From May 1991 to November 1993, raccoons in a treatment
   area were trapped, vaccinated, and released at the site of capture.
   Population responses were monitored in treatment and control areas using
   information from a municipal animal control agency. During a CD
   epizootic, the prevalence of infected animals detected at necropsy from
   a sample of the population was significantly lower in the treated area
   (1.4\%) than in the control area (8.3\%). Patterns of population change
   did not differ between the treatment and control areas before, during,
   or after the epizootic, indicating that CD did not limit the raccoon
   population. Thus, field vaccination can result in reduced disease
   prevalence, but will not necessarily result in increased raccoon
   abundance.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Four groups of spruce budworm larvae, Choristoneura fumiferana, of
   the same physiological stage (at the beginning of diapause) were exposed
   to natural temperatures, starting in July, August, September and
   October. Post-diapause emergence and certain metabolites were monitored
   throughout the overwintering period.
   2. Larval exposure to high temperatures for long periods before winter
   had a significant effect on temperature requirements for subsequent
   diapause development and apparently caused a certain amount of
   mortality, especially for those larvae that entered diapause earlier in
   the season.
   3. Substantial loss of lipid and glycogen reserves was related to
   intensity of high temperature exposure during the pre-winter period,
   which in turn was associated with the timing of diapause initiation.
   4. Patterns of glycerol accumulation during the winter were also
   influenced by temperature conditions in the early phase of diapause
   development.
   5. Among several possible mortality factors, an extended cool period in
   spring was suggested as a potential cause of overwintering mortality,
   which was closely associated with a deficiency in energy reserves caused
   by high temperature exposure before winter.
   6. These results stress the significant impact of pre-winter conditions
   on the overwintering process and highlight the importance of an
   ecophysiological approach to insect overwintering biology.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury was not regarded as a pollutant of primary importance until many
   deaths due to mercury poisoning occurred in the 1950s. More recently,
   adverse health effects have been documented at relatively low exposure
   levels, and monitoring data must now be interpreted in this light. The
   Mediterranean basin has been studied in great detail over the past 20
   years because of the anomalous natural presence of mercury. Marine
   animals of this basin have higher mercury body burdens than the same (or
   similar) species in the Atlantic. The mercury found in marine organisms
   is mainly in the form of methyl mercury. Long-term and frequent intake
   of seafood with high mercury levels by populations living in coastal
   fishing villages is associated with a toxic risk, especially in pregnant
   women. High blood and hair concentrations of mercury have repeatedly
   been found in fishermen of Tyrrhenian coastal villages. In some cases
   these concentrations have been associated with an increase in DNA damage
   in blood cells. High mercury levels in hair and blood of people from a
   fishing village of Madeira have also been found. This information
   deserves renewed scrutiny with regard to preventive efforts needed. (C)

Abstract = {{This study examined the impact of the application of a biocontrol yeast,
   Candida sake CPA-1 (3 x 10(6) colony forming units (cfu) ml(-1)) on the
   resident microbial populations just prior to harvest, during 7 months
   cold storage and subsequent ambient shelf-life in two seasons on apples
   untreated or treated with a preharvest pesticide programme. The changes
   in populations of the antagonistic yeast (C. sake) were also monitored.
   Generally, application of the antagonist had little effect on the total
   bacterial populations which remained very low both prior to harvest and
   subsequently during cold storage. White yeasts were predominant on the
   apples during the experimental period, with lower populations of pink
   yeasts. When apples were removed after 7 months to ambient conditions
   the yeast populations increased quickly but those apples treated with C.
   sake had significantly less white yeasts than untreated controls. The
   dominant filamentous fungi isolated were Cladosporium, Alternaria and
   Penicillium spp. Penicillium spp. which is responsible for major
   postharvest diseases was seldom isolated at preharvest but it became
   important during later cold storage and shelf life period. Populations
   of Cladosporium and Penicillium were significantly reduced by the C.
   sake treatment when removed from cold storage during the ambient
   shelf-life. In contrast, the Alternaria spp. were unaffected by the
   antagonist. The actual populations of C. sake applied decreased
   significantly immediately after application (24 h). However, they
   subsequently increased to a maximum after one month cold storage (10(3)
   cfu g(-1)), and populations increased again under ambient shelf-life
   conditions. The C. stake populations, and the resident microbial
   populations, were unaffected by preharvest fungicide applications. This
   study demonstrates that preharvest application of an antagonistic yeast
   such as C. sake has an impact on the resident mycoflora both during 7
   months cold storage and during ambient shelf-life storage.}},

Journal = {{FOREST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In northeastern U.S. forests there is considerable variation in
   susceptibility (defoliation potential) and vulnerability (tree
   mortality) to gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar {[}L.]). Thinning has been
   suggested as a way to reduce susceptibility and/or vulnerability. We
   evaluated how thinning affected the dynamics of gypsy moth populations
   by experimentally thinning half of each of eight oak-mixed hardwood
   stands in the Central Appalachians. Population dynamics of gypsy moth
   were monitored using yearly counts of egg masses, numbers of larvae
   hatching per mass, estimates of larval density, and weekly collections
   of larvae and pupae which were reared to quantify mortality due to
   parasitoids and disease. During the 8 yr study, three stands were
   heavily defoliated by outbreak populations of gypsy moth, three were
   sprayed with pesticides accidentally, and two were not disturbed.
   Egg-mass densities were slightly lower in the thinned portions of the
   undisturbed stands, but thinning had little or no effect on gypsy moth
   densities in defoliated and sprayed stands. Variation in mortality of
   gypsy moth caused by parasitoids and disease was related to variation in
   egg-mass densities in the current and/or preceding years. After
   adjusting for the effect of gypsy moth density, thinning had no
   significant effect on mortality from parasitoids or pathogens. We
   conclude that any reduction in egg mass densities as a result of
   thinning is likely related to the reduction in foliar biomass, not
   increased natural enemy activity.}},

Abstract = {{1. We tested for effects of habitat fragmentation in a controlled,
   replicated, field experiment, in south-eastern Australia. Our
   experimental subjects were eight carabid beetle species, and the carabid
   assemblage (45 species). Monitoring was by pitfall trapping in forest
   remnants and in adjacent continuous-forest controls. Remnants were of
   three sizes (0.25, 0.875, 3.062 ha.). Monitoring commenced 2 years prior
   to habitat fragmentation. Here we present results for 6 years after
   habitat fragmentation (4 years for species richness).
   2. We tested four hypotheses. Hypothesis one: habitat fragmentation
   reduces species richness in the remaining remnants. Carabid species
   richness was not different in habitat remnants compared to continuous
   forest, neither was carabid richness different for remnants of different
   sizes, or at monitoring sites close to remnant edges compared to sites
   in remnant interiors.
   3. Hypothesis two. populations decline as a result of habitat
   fragmentation. Two species of eight were completely isolated on remnants
   and both declined in abundance on remnants compared to control plots in
   continuous forest. The other six species responded in various ways,
   which included relative increases and decreases in abundance and no
   change, but as they were not completely isolated on remnants, their
   responses could not be explained by isolation.
   4. Hypothesis three: remaining subpopulations decline further on smaller
   habitat remnants than on larger remnants. Three species responded to
   remnant size; one was most abundant in small remnants, the second was
   most abundant in large remnants, and the third was equally abundant in
   small and large remnants and less abundant in medium-sized remnants.
   5. Hypothesis four: populations near to remnant edges decline further
   than populations in remnant interiors. Two species were more likely to
   occur in remnant interiors than at edges, whereas three species were
   equally likely to occur in remnant interiors and at edges.
   6. The effects of habitat fragmentation may be the consequence of: (i)
   isolation; and (ii) habitat modification. In this study, we were able to
   consider effects of isolation for two carabid species. We tested only
   one aspect of the habitat modification hypothesis, edge effects. We
   discuss the possibility that other aspects of habitat modification in
   remnants may explain some of our results and suggest that this is where
   future research be directed.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and leaf populations of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) were monitored
   following aerial application of commercial Bt formulations at the rate
   of 72 billion international units per acre per year during a 5-year
   period. Data from soil sample spore counts suggested that Bt spores
   persisted in Wasatch forest soils for up to 2 years but they did not
   proliferate. Bt isolates were recovered from leaf samples 12 months post
   application from sprayed, previously sprayed and from nonsprayed areas.
   The frequency and diversity of Bt isolates recovered from leaves was
   independent of sample area spray history. In accordance with U.S. Forest
   Service criteria, aerial application of Bt during a B-year period
   resulted in the eradication of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar, L) from the
   Wasatch Front region of the Wasatch Mountain Range, Utah. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Winter generally is considered the most stressful period for deer in
   northern latitudes, and prolonged consumption of poor-quality diets is
   often the primary factor increasing overwinter mortality. Although
   winter diets of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the
   northern Black Hills, South Dakota, have been documented, quality of
   these diets is unknown. It has been suggested that low-growing
   vegetation and agricultural lands are important factors in maintaining
   deer populations in the northern Black Hills; however, this hypothesis
   has not been tested. Additionally, a supplemental feeding program has
   been initiated in some areas of the northern Black Hills, but effects of
   this program are unknown. We used fecal indices to monitor changes in
   dietary quality in five study areas tone of which contained supplemental
   food plots for deer) at 2-week intervals from January to March 1992 and
   1993. We tested hypotheses that concentrations of fecal nitrogen (FN)
   and fecal phosphorus (FP) would not differ intraseasonally or among
   study areas. In the mild winter of 1992, concentrations of FN and FP
   rose (P < 0.001) as spring approached. In 1993, FN and FP levels did not
   differ intraseasonally (P > 0.05) but were related inversely to snow
   depth. Supplementally fed deer consumed higher-quality diets (P < 0.001)
   than nonsupplemented animals during both years. Among nonsupplemented
   deer, availability of agricultural land improved quality of the winter
   ranges in the northern Black Hills. Fecal indices are an effective
   method for monitoring changes in dietary quality.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of prior population density on use of space by
   meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, by maintaining two replicates
   each of populations of voles at low, medium, and high density in 0.16-ha
   fenced enclosures in southeastern New York for 20 months. All voles were
   then removed by Live-trapping and equal numbers of new animals were
   introduced into each enclosure and monitored by biweekly Live-trapping
   for 7 months. We determined patterns of space use of these voles using
   radiotelemetry. if previous density had a long-lasting effect on habitat
   quality, voles placed in enclosures that previously maintained
   high-density populations should have had larger home ranges with greater
   overlap than individuals in enclosures that previously maintained
   low-density populations. We found no significant effect of previous
   density on home-range size and overlap, or interfix movement distance.
   These results do not support the herbivore-resource mechanism for
   delayed density-dependence in meadow voles.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between ambient levels of selected air pollutants and
   pediatric asthma exacerbation in Atlanta were studied retrospectively.
   As a part of this study, temporal and spatial distributions of ambient
   ozone concentrations in the 20-county Atlanta metropolitan area during
   the summers of 1993, 1994, and 1995 were assessed. A universal kriging
   procedure was used for spatial interpolation of aerometric monitoring
   station data. In this paper, the temporal and spatial distributions of
   ozone are described, and regulatory and epidemiologic implications are
   discussed. For the study period, the Atlanta ozone nonattainment area
   based on the l-h, exceedance-based standard of 0.12 ppm is estimated to
   expand-from 56\% of the Atlanta MSA by area and 71\% by population to
   88\% by area and 96\% by population-under the new 8-h,
   concentration-based standard of 0.08 ppm. Regarding asthma exacerbation,
   a 4\% increase in pediatric asthma rate per 20-ppb increase in ambient
   ozone concentration was observed (p-value = 0.001), with ambient ozone
   level representing a general indicator of air quality due to its
   correlations with other pollutants. The use of spatial ozone estimates
   in the epidemiologic analysis demonstrates the need for control of
   demographic covariates in spatiotemporal assessments of associations of
   ambient air pollutant concentrations with health outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of a rising population and increased food demand has
   placed tremendous pressure on the land resources of Bangladesh. These
   pressures are exacerbated by the annual wet-season floods which
   frequently devastate much of the agricultural land. Successive
   governments have therefore sought international aid to assist in the
   development of flood control measures. Of particular importance are 14
   major schemes which aim to provide protection from 20-25 year return
   floods by the construction of earth-embanked enclosures. There is no
   doubt that these schemes have been very successful in protecting
   valuable agricultural areas from floods and hence increasing
   agricultural production. There is, however, growing evidence from a
   range of sources for long-term deterioration in soil fertility within
   the project areas. The study reported here is the first to
   systematically examine the changes taking place in soil properties
   following the establishment of a flood control, drainage and irrigation
   project. Comparison of two soil series, sampled from within and without
   the project area, demonstrate that within six years of project
   establishment, significant adverse changes have occurred in several soil
   properties; these include increasing acidity and a decline in available
   nutrients. The changes are attributable to a combination of poor
   management strategies and the absence of the annual flood input of silt.
   As Bangladesh cannot afford any decline in agricultural output, it is
   vital to establish whether adverse changes recorded here are occurring
   in other projects. This can be achieved by the establishment of a
   nationwide programme of soil fertility monitoring. (C) 1998 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to assess the value of Asterias rubens
   as a bioindicator of metal contamination in the field. Spatial gradients
   of Pb, Cd, and Zn contamination were identified along Sorfjord, and
   metal concentrations were consistently higher (1.7-8.3 times) in the
   body compartments of large asteroids sampled close to the smelters than
   in those sampled further away. Cd and Pb concentrations in the pyloric
   caeca varied along the fjord according to a decreasing sigmoidal
   relationship, while Cd and Pb concentrations in the body wall and the
   skeleton varied according to a decreasing exponential relationship. This
   suggests that the bioavailability of these metals has decreased over the
   last few years at the head of the fjord, which agrees generally with
   water chemistry data available from the State Pollution Monitoring
   Programme (Norway). The decrease in metal bioavailability could be a
   direct consequence of the 1992 remedial action taken in the fjord to
   reduce heavy metal release from the contaminated sediments. Lead
   concentrations in the skeletons of large asteroids (12-24 cm; 154 +/- 63
   mu g Pb g(-1) dry wt) were eight rimes higher than those in the
   skeletons of juvenile individuals (0.5-4 cm; 19 +/- 8 mu g Pb g(-1) dry
   wt) in the population located at the head of the fjord Asteroids of
   12-14 cm length were likely to be 4-7 y old (i.e. born before the
   remedial action) while small asteroids were born after the remedial
   action. According to comparisons with allometric relationships in an
   uncontaminated population and experimental exposures, results indicate
   that the half-life of Pb in the skeleton is long (i.e. several years)
   while the half-life of Cd and Zn is much shorter (i.e. several weeks for
   Cd, and short but not precisely known for Zn). A smaller size and
   unusual reduction of the skeleton of adult individuals at the head of
   the fjord were observed and may result from the effects of heavy metal
   pollution. A comparison between possible sources of contamination in the
   fiord (metals in water, food, and sediments) indicates that
   sediment-associated metals are likely to be an important source of
   contamination in this environment due to the microphagic activity of
   asteroids. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that seed predation by small mammals in old
   fields can be intense and, in conjunction with other herbivores, may
   influence the rate, composition and spatial pattern of tree invasion
   into these systems. Patterns of seed predation in old fields may be
   predictable, based on the preferences herbivores exhibit for particular
   microhabitats. Studies testing the strength of these linkages, however,
   are rare. The risk of predation for Foraging animals can have a
   considerable impact on decisions about where to feed and what to consume
   in particular microhabitats. We examined how an experimentally created
   gradient of predation risk influenced the microhabitat use and foraging
   behavior of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in an old field in
   central New Jersey, USA. Specifically, we monitored the removal of seeds
   from dishes placed in the center of replicated treatment plots in which
   we manipulated ground and canopy cover, as well as distance from the
   forest edge. We then determined the relative importance of these factors
   and their interactions in explaining patterns of seed predation by mice.
   In addition, the distribution and abundance of small mammals were
   monitored and the vegetation cover in the area immediately adjacent to
   our experimental plots was quantified to determine how these factors
   were related to patterns of seed removal. Other factors evaluated
   included seed species, nocturnal illumination, temperature,
   precipitation, and time of year. Ground cover, time of day, and distance
   from the forest edge explained the most variation in patterns of seed
   predation. Ground cover. particularly proximity to vines such as Rubus
   allegheniensis, appeared to take precedence over other microhabitat
   variables in the decisions seed predators made about where to forage.
   Significantly higher nocturnal rates of seed removal, trap data, feces
   and seed remains left around seed dishes, reinforced previous findings
   which suggest that white-footed mice are the dominant seed predators in
   the northeastern old fields. However, spatial patterns of seed removal
   did not correspond with the distribution and abundance of mice as
   indicated by the trapping data. These results suggest that the impact of
   P. leucopus on the spatial patterns of seed survival is more dependent
   on the behavioral responses of individual mice than the distributions of
   the populations they comprise. Overall, there was little variation from
   general patterns of seed predation for specific tree species, suggesting
   that in old fields dominated by mice, there may be relatively uniform
   regions of high and low seed predation based on the microhabitat
   preferences of this seed consumer. The consequences of the interaction
   between old field vegetation and patterns of seed predation by mice for
   tree invasion and establishment in old fields are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Immunocompetence is regarded to be one of the principal links in
   mechanisms of population regulation in small mammals. We assessed immune
   responsiveness to injection of sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in sympatric
   populations of red and bank voles in southern West Siberia, Russia,
   during the cycle of density from 1991 to 1995. We used a splenic
   plaque-forming cells (PFC) technique to measure the immune response to
   the antigen. In an attempt to establish relationships of immunity with
   intrinsic factors involved in population regulation we monitored the
   following parameters: population numbers, recruitment rate, and
   adrenocortical activity.
   The analysis of covariance showed a significant effect of reproductive
   status of voles and independent significant effects of month and year of
   capture on immune response to SRBC. In general, immature young was
   significantly higher responders as compared to mature (breeding) adults.
   The seasonal and long-term variations in numbers of PFC were similar in
   both species. Seasonal minimum of the immune response was observed
   within the period of intensive breeding in June and July. Among the
   years the immune responsiveness was maximal in the phase of population
   depression. The increase in maturation rate as density increased
   coincided with a decrease in immune responsiveness. The correlation
   analysis showed little or no evidence of links between the immunity and
   adrenocortical activity in the populations under study. Based on the
   patterns of seasonal and long-term variations of surveyed variables it
   is likely that physiological mechanisms governing the processes of
   sexual maturation and reproduction of red and bank voles are involved in
   the regulation of immunity.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments monitoring the egg and larval production of captive
   northwest Atlantic cod Gadus morthua indicated that first-time spawners
   perform poorly compared to second-time spawners. They breed for a
   shorter period, produce fewer egg batches, exhibit lower fecundity, and
   produce smaller eggs with lower fertilization and hatching rates;
   moreover, their larvae are less likely to hatch in environmental
   conditions favorable for survival. Batch-average egg diameters of
   first-time spawners underwent a continuous rapid decline between initial
   and terminal batches, whereas second-time spawners commonly exhibited a
   parabolic curve (slight increase followed by a decrease). Seasonal
   composite hatching rates of all eggs spawned by first- and second-time
   spawners were 13 and 628, respectively. Larval production per maternal
   gram was an order of magnitude greater for second-time than for
   first-time spawners (200 versus 20 larvae/g). Batch-average egg diameter
   declined 11\% and larval dry weight declined 29\% from initial to
   terminal batches when data were pooled over both spawner types. Egg
   diameter correlated positively with larval dry weight, yolk dry weight,
   and ratio of yolk to larval dry weight. Additional monitoring of
   individuals between the first and second breeding year confirmed results
   obtained on 12 cod pairs monitored during the same year at constant
   temperature. These results have a direct bearing on the development of
   mathematical models of spawner-recruitment relationships, and they
   suggest that conventional approaches may overestimate the reproductive
   potential of age-truncated populations.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary by the wakasagi
   Hypomesus nipponensis poses threats of competition and hybridization
   with the endemic delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus. a species listed
   as threatened by federal and state agencies. Small individuals of these
   species are difficult to distinguish morphologically, but correct
   identification is extremely important to avoid mistaking delta smelt for
   wakasagi under the limited take provisions of the federal endangered
   species act. Allozyme markers were used to identify 280 individual fish
   from several sites across the range of H. transpacificus. We used these
   results to document the current level of invasion by H. nipponensis,
   quantify levels of misidentification based on morphological characters,
   identify hybrid individuals, and estimate levels of gene dow in H.
   transpacificus. Wakasagi have spread throughout the Sacramento-San
   Joaquin estuary, and further monitoring will be necessary to determine
   the long-term consequences of their invasion on the native delta smelt.
   Our data suggest that when the level of uncertainty in morphological
   identification is high, biochemical identification is the safest way to
   identify fish. We identified only two F-1 hybrid individuals, suggesting
   that although hybridization does occur, it is not a serious threat to
   delta smelt at the present time. Finally, estimates of a based on four
   variable allozyme loci indicate that gene how between our four sampled
   locations is very high in H. transpacificus.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrifiers are more sensitive than heterotrophic bacteria to
   environmental changes (such as temperature, pH, shock loads as
   biological oxygen demand or nitrogen, and toxic/inhibiting loads).
   Moreover, they are slow-growing bacteria. Thus, a careful control of
   their activity is needed to achieve continuous good effluent quality. To
   maintain an actively nitrifying population, efficient process control
   requires monitoring of the toxicity and the ammonium concentration. The
   latter is commonly measured by on-line ammonium analyzers. A new sensor
   has been developed to measure both the ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) content
   in the mixed liquor and the activity of the nitrifiers. The operating
   principle of the biosensor is based on a titration method, which
   measures the protons produced during nitrification. This paper describes
   the biosensor and the experimental results (estimation of NH4+-N
   concentration and nitrification rate) obtained using activated sludge
   from wastewater treatment plants receiving hospital and food industry

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the cost and benefit of the
   implementation of a specific energy saving program in Hungary. We have
   considered the possible reduced damage to public health, building
   materials and agricultural crops that may be obtained from reducing
   emissions of important air pollutants and also how the program
   contributes to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. The measures are
   described in the National Energy Efficiency Improvement and Energy
   Conservation Programs (NEEIECP), elaborated by the Hungarian Ministry of
   Industry and Trade and accepted by the Government in 1994. The energy
   saving expected from the program is approximately 64 PJ/year. The
   benefits were estimated using monitoring data and population/recipient
   data from urban and rural areas in Hungary together with
   exposure-response functions and valuation estimates mainly from western
   studies. Our analysis indicates that the main benefit from reducing the
   concentrations of pollutants relates to public health and that reduced
   prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases is an important effect.
   Reduced premature mortality is also important and the estimated
   attributable risk of air pollution to excess mortality at present is
   approximately 6\%. The estimated annual benefit of improved health
   conditions alone is likely to exceed the investments needed to implement
   the program. In addition there are significant benefits due to reduced
   replacement and maintenance costs for building materials (30-35 million
   US\$ annually in Budapest only). The damage to crops due to ozone is
   large, but a significant improvement in Hungary depends upon concerted
   actions in several countries. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of sexual reproduction and clonal grow th were investigated in
   the understory palm Reinhardtia gracilis var. gracilior over a 3-yr
   period. R. gracilis is a very abundant clonal palm in the tropical rain
   forest of Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Because ramets form clumps,
   genets are easily identified in the held. Genets were monitored in a
   0.5-ha area, and classified by size according to the number of ramets
   they possessed. In contrast to clonal growth, sexual reproduction was
   highly dependent on genet size. The probability of reproduction, the
   number of inflorescences, and the number of fruits produced were
   positively correlated with genet size. However, neither the probability
   of producing a ramet, nor the number of ramets produced per genet were
   correlated with genet size. Over the 3 yr of study, 55\% of the genet
   population had at least one ramet with reproductive structures, while
   <1\% (a single genet in one year) had six ramets with flowers.
   Thirty-two percent of the mature genets reproduced during each of three
   consecutive years. In contrast, 58\% of the genets produced no new
   ramets during these 3 yr. No evidence was found of a trade-off between
   clonal growth and sexual reproduction. Ramet production increases genet
   size and this in turn increases genet reproductive performance. Clonal
   growth in this species may be viewed as a growth strategy that tends to
   maximize genet fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Persistence of endophyte-free (E-) tail fescue (Festuca arundinacea
   Schreb.) is erratic. Little information exists as to how fast endophyte
   (Neotyphodium coenophialum)-infected (E+) tall fescue might encroach on
   E- tall fescue and whether specific conditions might influence the speed
   of encroachment. Plots of E+ and E- tall fescue genotypes 7 and 17 were
   established using a modified Nelder's design to compare performance of
   the E+ forms of the plants in pure and mixed communities at different
   population densities. The plots were planted at the USDA Southern
   Piedmont Conservation Research Laboratory in Watkinsville, Georgia, and
   the University of Georgia Plant Sciences Farm in Bogart, Georgia. Plants
   were grown over a 5 year period and dry matter yield monitored 1, 3, and
   5 years after establishment. Relative crowding coefficients were
   calculated for each to establish trends of encroachment of the E+ on the
   E- plants in the mixed communities. Generally, dry matter yields of E+
   tall fescue were greater than E- tall fescue regardless of whether they
   were grown in pure or mixed communities. As time progressed, the
   difference in dry matter yield between E- and E- tall fescue grown in
   mixed communities was greater than that of the pure communities.
   Relative crowding coefficients increased as time progressed. Relative
   crowding coefficients at the Walkinsville location were greater after 5
   years than those at the Plant Sciences Farm. Therefore, site specific
   conditions exist which affect the competitiveness of E- tall fescue and
   degree of encroachment by E+ tall fescue. Research is needed to identify
   which biotic, abiotic and management variables exacerbate encroachment
   of E+ tall fescue to better define the conditions which best suit E-

Abstract = {{in the last 15-20 years, coarse grasses have spread to dominate much of
   the ground vegetation of open areas in Monks Wood, a woodland nature
   reserve in eastern England. Possible causes of these vegetational
   changes are discussed briefly. Since the 1970s, butterflies and maths
   have been monitored in the wood as part of national monitoring schemes.
   Three butterfly species with larvae that feed on coarse grasses have
   become much more abundant in the wood while most other butterfly species
   have declined in numbers relative to other sites in eastern England.
   Moths with grass-feeding larvae, as a group, have increased in abundance
   significantly more than other moths. There is evidence for butterflies
   that the trends recorded in Monks Wood have occurred elsewhere in
   eastern England, although less strongly than in the wood. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The population size and extent of habitat for the Seychelles Black
   Paradise Flycatcher are compared with earlier investigations. The
   estimated world population is 90 individuals (1992). Deforestation on
   the western plateau of La Digue is estimated to have resulted in a 24\%
   decline in Takamaka Calophyllum inophyllum and Indian Almond Terminalia
   catappa woodland since 1978. Monitoring of nest site use supports
   previous associations of the Flycatcher's dependence on Takamaka and
   Indian Almond woodland (Collar and Stuart, 1985; Watson, 1991).
   Preliminary observations suggest that land management practices
   (clearing Takamaka and Indian Almond woodland for development) should be
   mitigated in view of the potential impact on nest site use by the
   flycatcher. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During 1994-1996 we captured and radiocollared fawn (6-9 months old) and
   adult White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in yarding and
   non-yarding populations in New Brunswick using Clover trapping, darting
   from tree stands, rocket netting, and helicopter net gunning. With the
   exception of net gunning, we immobilized 81 deer with a combination of
   ketamine HCL and xylazine HCL. We antagonized chemical immobilizations
   by administering 10-27.5 mg yohimbine hydrochloride. Forty-eight deer
   were captured in Clover traps from which seven escaped. Ninety-two deer
   were captured in both study areas; 19 in the non-yarding population and
   73 in the yarding population. Ground capture methods were effective in
   the yarding population but not in the non-yarding population where
   capture rates were lower apparently because deer were not attracted to
   baits. Forty-three deer were captured and radiocollared by helicopter
   net gunning using 16.5 hours of helicopter time. Several methods were
   used to locate neonate fawns. Methods included monitoring radiocollared
   doe movements and behavior, checks of open fields, night-lighting,
   intensive ground grid searches, and opportunistically. Of these, only
   intensive ground searching was effective (35 of 50 captures) and
   required an average of 30.6 person-hours per fawn captured.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of amount of food on vitellogenic oocyte size
   and number (fecundity) between two experimental groups of Atlantic
   herring (Clupea harengus) kept in separate but identical compartments of
   a large seawater tank. Growth and maturation were monitored for 1.5
   years. Each group of 200 fish was fed exclusively on krill. Al the end
   of the experiment, a high-ration group, fed 12 mg.g fish(-1)day(-1), had
   similar weights-at-length as wild specimens of the same stock. A
   low-ration group fed about half the amount of the high-ration group had
   significantly lower weights-at-length. Ration had no effect on oocyte
   size and relative potential fecundity (oocytes per gram), but mean
   potential fecundity (oocytes per fish) of the low-ration fish was 26\%
   lower than that of the high-ration fish. The relative intensity of early
   stages of atresia was quantified histologically. Atresia is a common
   phenomenon in Atlantic herring and increases markedly with suboptimal
   feeding. Mean relative atretic intensities were estimated at about 3 and
   6\% for the high- and low-ration groups, respectively, but with large
   intragroup variation. Modeled realized fecundity (spawned eggs per fish)
   indicated a 9 and 40\% reduction compared with the measured potential
   fecundities, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In 1992 a diving buoy was installed within a marine reserve off the
   northeastern coast of Spain, where diving had not previously been
   permitted. We monitored the effects of diving on a colonial bryozoan
   (Pentapora fascialis) and carried out the study on two distinct between
   habitats, boulders and vertical walls. We used a ``beyond
   before-after/control-impact{''} sampling design in which one potentially
   affected and several control locations were sampled simultaneously
   before and after the installation of the diving buoy. We hypothesized
   that diving has three major impacts: (1) it decreases the density of P.
   fascialis, (2) it reduces the mean size of P. fascialis colonies, and
   (3) it restricts P. fascialis colonies to cryptic positions. Surveys of
   diving activity, conducted from 1992 to 1995 showed that diving
   increased 60-fold at the impact location. Analysis revealed a
   significant decrease in density of colonies of P. fascialis (similar to
   50\% from 1992 to 1993) in both communities at the impact location 1
   year after the start of the diving disturbance. The effect of diving on
   the size of colonies was not clear. The analysis revealed no general
   pattern of significant impact, although the impact location suffered a
   general loss of large colonies P. fascialis colonies on boulders were
   more numerous in more cryptic positions once diving activity began at
   the impact location. On walls, although there was a reduction of more
   exposed colonies after the start of the disturbance (from 1992 to 1993),
   the changes over time were not significant. The control locations showed
   no significant changes in the distribution of the degree of exposure of
   colonies over time on either community. The effects of diving differed
   in the two communities studied. he impact on boulders was stronger than
   that on the walls. This may be explained by the protection provided by
   the dense canopy of gorgonian (Paramuricea clavata), the largest
   organism on vertical walls. On boulders erosion was continuous and
   cumulative. On walls, however, once the divers had eliminated the most
   exposed colonies-mainly the epibionts-the arboreal structure of the
   gorgonians prevented divers from coming into direct contact with the
   communities and reduced the risk of erosion. Sublittoral benthic
   communities in the Northwestern Mediterranean constituted by sessile
   organisms with fragile calcareous or corneous skeletons are not adapted
   to the severe disturbances caused by continuous and intense diving.
   Recovery after such a disturbance appears to be slow and difficult.
   Current diving activity may not allowed disturbed communities at diving
   sites to recover. The results of this experiment should be considered by
   managers and the data used to evaluate the models on which management
   decisions are based.}},

Abstract = {{The Yellow-shouldered Amazon (Amazona barbadensis) is one of the most
   endangered species of parrots in Venezuela. An integrated conservation
   program has focused on reversing the causes of parrot population decline
   on the Macanao Peninsula in Margarita Island. As a result, the parrot
   population on the island has increased to about 1900 individuals in 1996
   from an estimated population of 750 in 1989, when the project started.
   Cooperation from national and local authorities and the project's
   community outreach have resulted in several confiscated chicks. Whereas
   most confiscated chicks were successfully reintroduced in a
   cross-fostering nest program, some had to be kept in captivity for later
   release. We hand-reared 14 A. barbadensis and housed the for a year in a
   large outdoor aviary. Before release the birds were screened to
   determine their general health. Four parrots were fitted with radio
   transmitters and monitored for a minimum of 11 months. All 4 birds with
   radio transmitters survived and adapted successfully to their natural
   environment, 10 of the 12 released parrots survived at least 1 year, and
   1 was seen alive 34 months after release. Integration into wild groups
   varied from 5 to 9 months, with the two youngest parrots showing a
   slower integration process. None of the parrots reproduced the first
   year after release. Later three were seen scouting nesting holes with
   their partners, and one of the parrots was confirmed attending a nest
   with three eggs 28 months after release. Two chicks fledged from this
   nest. A substantial portion of the success orf this program rests on 5
   years of previous work on environmental education, public awareness, and
   studies on the parrot's biology. To provide some guidance on the costs
   of reintroduction projects, we estimated an overall expenditure of about
   U.S. \$2800 per parrot. Previous attempts to reintroduce captive-raised
   parrots are introduced to an area with a resident population. Although
   reintroduction can significantly reduce the chances of extinction, it
   also involves some risks. The long-term solution against extinction of
   A. barbadensis will be a combination of scientific understanding of
   their biology and habitat, awareness by local human communities,
   reduction in the wild bird trade, and continued commitment by
   conservation enforcement agencies.}},

Abstract = {{Models of habitat selection commonly assume that higher quality source
   habitats will be occupied at higher densities than sink habitats. We
   examined an apparent sink habitat for California Towhees (Pipilo
   crissalis) in which densities are greater than in nearby source
   habitats. We estimated territory density using spot-mapping and
   monitored nests of towhees in grazed and ungrazed oak pine woodland
   habitat. Breeding density of California Towhees was higher in ungrazed
   oak pine woodlands than in grazed areas, yet birds in the ungrazed site
   experienced lower reproductive success. Predation during the nestling
   period was primarily responsible for the lower nest success. Clutch size
   and the number of young fledged were also lower in the understory.
   Grazed sites had greater cover of live oak than ungrazed sites, and
   successful nests were more often built in live oak than in other plant
   species. This pattern could not be explained by dominant birds settling
   in grazed sites and excluding subdominant individuals because a large
   proportion of adults continued to settle in the ungrazed area. Towhees
   may have perceived the dense foliage of the ungrazed area as suitable
   due to abundant nest sites, cover, and food, resulting in an
   ``ecological trap{''}. The resulting high density of birds ther may have
   contributed to density-dependent predation. Alternatively, towhees are
   not ideally adapted to their habitats because of their sedentary habits
   and site tenacity that is not affected by persistent nest loss. We
   stress the need to examine the reproductive success and productivity of
   individual species within specific habitat types.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated management of storage pests requires understanding storage
   ecosystems and accurately monitoring pest population levels.
   Geostatistical techniques for. spatial analysis provide a powerful tool
   to assist in biological interpretation of sample counts and trap
   captures of insects, as well as interpretation of physical measurements
   such as grain temperature and moisture content. Contour analysis is a
   S-step process. Data are first posted to a map of sample points; then a
   denser grid of data points is generated by interpolation (using one of
   several algorithms), and contours (lines joining points with equal
   values) are drawn at some axed interval. This provides a contour display
   showing the value of the variable at all points on the surface
   represented by the sample points. The utility of this method in
   stored-product protection is illustrated by a series of studies based on
   data sets for stored corn. These include comparison of spatial
   distribution of species and species interactions: analysis of temporal
   changes in distribution, precision targeting, and evaluation of control
   measures; interpretation of trap catch; examination of physical
   variables and interactions of insects with the physical environment; and
   analysis of goodness of fit of contour surfaces to the data The utility
   of techniques such as grid subtraction and construction of probability
   contours is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal and spatial characteristics of a community of cavity nesting
   megachilid bee species and their introduced competitors were examined at
   a site in the Central Valley of California. Two of the introduced bee
   species, Megachile apicalis Spinola and Megachile rotundata (F.), were
   frequent nest site occupants and accounted for 19.6 and 3.4\% of all
   artificial nesting cavities (trap-nests) monitored during the 1st and
   2nd yr of this study, respectively. These species were most active
   before and after the peak in native bee nesting activity and tended to
   occupy xeric habitats, despite significantly higher larval mortality
   associated with such environments. The ability to occupy a wide array of
   habitats may account for the invasion success of M. apicalis in
   California. Another invader, the European earwig, Forficula auricularia
   L., was a frequent occupant of nesting cavities in mesic habitats,
   accounting for 59 and 85\% occupancy of trap-nests during the Ist and
   2nd yr of the study, respectively. Exclusion experiments indicate earwig
   densities were sufficient to displace female bees at nest sites with 1/3
   as much nesting activity occurring in sampling units that allowed entry
   by earwigs as those made inaccessible to them with sticky barriers. In
   comparison, all native species (including bees and wasps) never
   accounted for >25\% of all occupied nesting cavities of either
   monitoring period of the study.}},

Abstract = {{Predation on larvae and pupae of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.)

   and 8 uncut stands, rates of survival of lan ae and pupae were monitored
   in 3 types of exclosures placed at 3 heights in the forest strata. The
   abundance of small mammals was measured within each of these stands
   using pitfall traps. 37\% of larvae and 25\% of pupae were killed by
   predators over the 3 d of observations each year. Thinning did not
   influence the proportion of larvae or pupae killed. Survival of larvae
   and pupae on the ground was significantly lower than that found on tree
   boles or in the foliage. Differences in survival among exclosure types
   indicated that invertebrates were the major predators of larvae, and
   small mammals were the major predators of pupae.}},

Abstract = {{Four major monoterpenes, (+/-)-alpha-pinene, 1(S)-(-)-beta-pinene,
   (R)-(+)-limonene, and myrcene are found in the cones of eastern white
   pines, Pinus strobus L. Mixtures of these, as well as, alpha-pinene or
   beta-pinene alone. increased catches of male white pine cone beetles,
   Conophthorus coniperda (Schwartz), in traps baited with the female sex
   pheromone, (+/-)-trans-pityol. The monoterpenes by themselves as
   mixtures or individually (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene) were not
   attractants for males or females. Traps baited with (+/-)-trans-pityol
   and alpha-pinene caught as many, or significantly more beetles than
   those baited with pityol and a four monoterpene mixture (1:1:1:1) used
   in seed orchards in North Carolina Ohio, and Virginia. Three beetle
   produced compounds, conophthorin, trans-pinocarveol, and myrtenol did
   not enhance catches of males or females in (+/-)-trans-pityol-baited
   traps. Racemic E-(+/-)-conophthorin, E-(-)-conophthorin, and
   E-(+)-conophthorin significantly reduced catches of males in traps
   baited with (+)-trans-pityol alone. Female C. coniperda were not
   attracted to any of the host-or beetle-produced compounds tested. The
   study demonstrated that traps with baits releasing (+/-)-trans-pityol at
   about 1mg/wk with (+/-)-alpha-pinene (98\% pure) are potentially
   valuable tools for C. coniperda pest management. Baited traps can be
   used to monitor C. coniperda populations or possibly to reduce seed
   losses in a beetle trap-out control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The industrial accident that occurred in the town of Seveso, Italy, in
   1976 exposed a large population to substantial amounts of relatively
   pure 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Extensive monitoring of soil
   levels and measurements of a limited number of human blood samples
   allowed classification of the exposed population into three categories,
   A (highest exposure), B (median exposure), and R (lowest exposure).
   Early health investigations including liver function, immune function,
   neurologic impairment, and reproductive effects yielded inconclusive
   results. Chloracne (nearly 200 cases with a definite exposure
   dependence) was the only effect established with certainty. Long-term
   studies were conducted using the large population living in the
   surrounding noncontaminated territory as reference. An excess mortality
   from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases was uncovered, possibly
   related to the psychosocial consequences of the accident in addition to
   the chemical contamination. An excess of diabetes cases was also found.
   Results of cancer incidence and mortality follow-up showed an increased
   occurrence of cancer of the gastrointestinal sites and of the lymphatic
   and hematopoietic tissue. Experimental and epidemiologic data as well as
   mechanistic knowledge support the hypothesis that the observed cancer
   excesses are associated with dioxin exposure. Results cannot be viewed
   as conclusive. The study is continuing in an attempt to overcome the
   existing limitations (few individual exposure data, short latency
   period, and small population size for certain cancer types) and to
   explore new research paths (e.g., differences in individual
   susceptibility).}},

Abstract = {{Most evolutionary models treat virulence as an unavoidable consequence
   of microparasite replication and have predicted that in mixed-genotype
   infections, natural selection should favor higher levels of virulence
   than is optimal in genetically uniform infections. Increased virulence
   may evolve as a genetically fixed strategy, appropriate for the
   frequency of mixed infections in the population, or may occur as a
   conditional response to mixed infection, that is, a facultative
   strategy. Here we test whether facultative alterations in replication
   rates in the presence of competing genotypes occur and generate greater
   virulence. An important alternative, not currently incorporated in
   models of the evolution of virulence, is that host responses mounted
   against genetically diverse parasites may be more costly or less
   effective than those against genetically uniform parasites. If so, mixed
   clone infections will be more virulent for a given parasite replication
   rate.
   Two groups of mice were infected with one of two clones of Plasmodium
   chabaudi parasites, and three groups of mice were infected with 1:9,
   5:5, or 9:1 mixtures of the same two clones. Virulence was assessed by
   monitoring mouse body weight and red blood cell density. Transmission
   stage densities were significantly higher in mixed-than in single-clone
   infections. Within treatment groups, transmission stage production
   increased with the virulence of the infection, a phenotypic correlation
   consistent with the genetic correlation assumed by much of the
   theoretical work on the evolution of virulence. Consistent with
   theoretical predictions of facultative alterations in virulence, we
   found that mice infected with both parasite clones lost more weight and
   had on average lower blood counts than those infected with single-clone
   infections. However, there was no consistent evidence of the mechanism
   invoked by evolutionary models that predict this effect. Replication
   rates and parasite densities were not always higher in mixed-clone
   infections, and for a given replication rate or parasite density,
   mixed-clone infections were still more virulent. Instead, prolonged
   anemia and increased transmission may have occured because genetically
   diverse infections are less rapidly cleared by hosts. Differences in
   maximum weight loss occured even when there were comparable parasite
   densities in mixed-and single-clone infections. We suggest that mounting
   an immune response against more that one genotype is more costly for
   hosts, which therefore suffer higher virulence.}},

Abstract = {{A simultaneous comparison of human exposure to solar ultraviolet
   radiation at two locations was performed to study the effect of
   environmental factors and human attitudes on personal ultraviolet
   exposure, The study took place on 29 October 1996 in Toowoomba (27.5
   degrees S, 151,9 degrees E) and Brisbane (27,4 degrees S, 153,1 degrees
   E), Queensland, Australia, From the data collected by calibrated ambient
   ultraviolet monitoring stations located in Toowoomba and Brisbane,
   Toowoomba received 68\% more UVA (320-400 nm) and 61\% more UVB (280-320
   nm) than Brisbane from 07:00 to 10:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time
   (EST), From 10:00 to 17:00 EST Toowoomba received 5\% more WA and 20\%
   less UVB than Brisbane, High ambient ultraviolet levels recorded by
   ultraviolet stations were reinforced by measurement of the personal
   ultraviolet exposure of human subjects wearing polysulfone dosimeters.
   Contrary to the common belief that the ultraviolet exposure to the human
   body is higher near the beach (i.e., coastal areas) than the inland
   area, the average erythemal weighted ultraviolet exposure on the chest
   and shoulder of each subject in the inland city of Toowoomba (127 km to
   the west of Brisbane) was 30\% higher than in the coastal city of
   Brisbane from 07:00 to 17:00 EST. Evidence is also presented to suggest
   a relationship between altitude, climatic conditions, the human
   attitude, and the level of personal exposure to ultraviolet radiation.}},

Abstract = {{The Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus (de Haan, 1853), discovered
   on the coast of New Jersey in 1988, is now known to be distributed in
   the western Atlantic from Massachusetts (south of Boston) to Oregon
   Inlet, North Carolina. Living in the mid to upper rocky intertidal zone,
   it exploits a niche mostly unoccupied by native brachyurans. In the
   northern part of its range there is some mid-intertidal overlap with the
   green crab, Carcinus maenas. In North Carolina H. sanguineus becomes
   sympatric in the high intertidal with another grapsid, the wharf crab,
   Armases cinereum. Distributional evidence indicates that H. sanguineus
   was probably introduced via ballast water at one or more major shipping
   centres south of Cape Cod (i.e. the New York Eight, Delaware Bay,
   Chesapeake Bay), perhaps in the early 1980s. Its present latitudinal
   range in the western Atlantic is only about one-fifth of that in the
   western Pacific. H. sanguineus is now the most abundant brachyuran at
   the intertidal monitoring site in southern New Jersey, and apparently in
   some areas of Long Island Sound to the north. In New Jersey, crabs range
   in carapace width from 2.3 to 43.9 mm. The breeding season is from late
   April through September, and recruitment to the intertidal population
   begins in June and continues through the fall and winter. Some crabs
   become subtidal, particularly during the winter months, as evidenced by
   the growth of bryozoans, mussels and barnacles on their carapaces. There
   is no evidence in this population of parasitism with metacercariae,
   nemerteans, rhizocephalans or bopyrid and entoniscid isopods. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Infestation levels, seasonality, and distribution of the meadow
   spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius (L.), on musk thistle, Carduus nutans
   L., were monitored in eastern and middle Tennessee during a 2-yr study.
   Spittle masses were found on thistle from early to mid-April until late
   June, and most (ca. 60 to 80\%) were found on the leaf internodes along
   the main stem. In eastern Tennessee, 50 to 90\% of the plants were
   infested with spittle masses by early to mid-April; corresponding
   infestations were generally lower (0 to 10\%) in middle Tennessee. Musk
   thistle development and populations of meadow spittlebug nymphs were
   well synchronized, as suitable host plant material was available for
   nymphs during mid-April to early June. Thus, musk thistle may be an
   important reservoir host for the meadow spittlebug in Tennessee.
   Spittlebug adults may subsequently move to grasses and economically
   important crops as musk thistle populations mature.}},

Abstract = {{1. The harbour seal population Phoca vitulina in the entire Wadden Sea
   was severely depleted due to a virus-epizootic during 1988. A
   comprehensive study on the population biology and activity patterns was
   subsequently initiated to design a management and conservation plan. The
   main objective of this study was to estimate harbour seal abundance in
   the different regions of the Wadden Sea.
   2, We investigated the potential of a mark-recapture experiment using
   VHF radio-tags in combination with repeated aerial surveys to estimate
   the number of harbour seals in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. The
   number of harbour seals hauled-out and the presence of any radio-tagged
   seals was monitored during seven aerial surveys of all known haul-out
   sites in the Dutch Wadden Sea over the 1994 breeding season,
   3, A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator was developed to infer the rate
   of tag-loss and the size of the local prepupping population.
   4, The ML estimate of the number of harbour seals in the Dutch Wadden
   Sea was 1536 (95\% confidence limits were 1225 and 2200). The
   corresponding maximum proportion of seals hauled-out was 68\%.
   5, The use of VHF radio-tags which can be monitored from the air
   provides a way of correcting aerial survey counts for the proportion of
   harbour seals hauled-out during the surveys. Since haul-out behaviour
   may be influenced by local conditions, such as exposure time of sand
   banks, we recommend this technique be repeated in other areas of the
   Wadden Sea rather than using the estimates from the current study in
   other areas.}},

Abstract = {{Three commercially available sex pheromone lures (Trece, Scentry, and
   Hereon) for the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), were
   effective for capturing males in Universal Moth Traps (Unitraps). The
   Trece and Scentry lures were equally effective, and there was some
   evidence for significantly greater captures with Hereon than with Trece
   lures es, Longevity of the Trece, Scentry, and Hereon lures was 23, 37,
   and 28 -37 d, respectively. Of the trap designs evaluated, Unitraps were
   the most effective. All-green and all-white Unitraps baited with Trece
   lures were significantly less effective than those with a green cover,
   yellow top, and white bottom (multicolored). Multicolored Unitraps
   captured significantly greater numbers of males than Multipher li, 2, or
   3 traps, and than commercially fabricated wire cone or commercially
   available Scentry Heliothis traps. Checking the Scentry Heliothis traps
   daily, rather than at 2- or 3-d intervals, as a way to reduce escape of
   moths that did not enter the trap tops, did not increase efficacy
   relative to Unitraps. There was no significant difference between
   captures in the wire cone and Scentry tl aps. These data should be
   useful in developing a standard trapping system for monitoring and
   population dynamics studies of the beet armyworm.}},

   work environments, and 16 job classification categories, amounting to
   144 unique job categories which were consolidated using the job-exposure
   matrix presented into 282 three-digit Dictionary of Occupational Title

Title = {{Molecular and morphological analysis of Enteromorpha intestinalis and

Abstract = {{The very common green seaweeds Enteromorpha intestinalis (L.) Nees and
   E. compressa (L.) Nees are important fouling organisms and have commonly
   been used as indicators of eutrophication, but their taxonomic status is
   problematic. The genus presents extreme difficulties because there is
   wide intraspecific variation in morphology, but morphological
   differences between species are small and difficult to detect. In this
   study, molecular data were used in parallel with morphological
   characters to resolve the taxonomic problems. Phylogenetic analysis of
   sequences of the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 and the 5.8S
   gene distinguished two groups of samples, which were identified by
   morphological characters as E. compressa (branched) and E. intestinalis
   (normally unbranched). There was a low level of sequence divergence
   within each group of samples, but divergence between groups was as great
   as that between either of the two species and the outgroup E. prolifera.
   Clades rep resenting E. compressa and E. intestinalis were also found in
   analyses of an independent molecular data set, chloroplast DNA
   restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Enteromorpha
   intestinalis and E. compressa represent two distinct, genetically
   divergent species. Reinterpretation of published studies shows that
   these species are reproductively isolated. However, E. compressa and E.
   intestinalis are sometimes very difficult to distinguish from each other
   and could be regarded as cryptic species. The presence or absence of
   branching was the most useful character distinguishing these two
   species, but there was an element of ambiguity because low salinity or
   salinity shock can induce branching in E. intestinalis. If environmental
   factors such as salinity are taken into account, branching can be used
   to identify the great majority of thalli correctly. This study therefore
   provides a basis for identifying the two most important marine fouling
   macroalgae and for their use in environmental monitoring and
   experimentation. Typification of these two Linnaean species showed that
   current usage of the names accords with the lectotype and protologue of
   both species. Samples that resembled E. usneoides did not form a clade
   in any of the trees, and constraining the data to support the monophyly
   of this group incurred a penalty. Enteromorpha usneoides appears to be
   an ecotype of E. compressa.}},

Abstract = {{The predation potential of Pleurobrachia rhodopis in the northwestern
   Mediterranean was studied using two methods. In laboratory experiments,
   adult copepods (Acartia clausi) were used as prey in a large range of
   concentrations and in two fixed volumes of 1 and 51 beakers. We found,
   for three defined size classes of predators, that the clearance rate was
   independent of the food availability. In all prey concentrations used,
   there was no satiation of P. rhodopis. In 11 beakers, P. rhodopis spent
   twice as much time searching for prey as in 51 beakers and feeding rates
   in the larger volume were always superior to those of the smaller one.
   In situ observations of P. rhodopis and copepod populations were
   monitored during 1994 and 1995 in the bay of Villefranche-sur-Mer.
   Predation impact of the ctenophore on copepods was calculated by
   combining experimental water volume cleared of copepods with in situ
   abundances of prey and predators. The maximum predation impact was 0.6\%
   of the copepod populations per day; thus, the predation pressure of P.
   rhodopis in the bay is not significant for the establishment or
   maintenance of the copepod populations.}},

Abstract = {{We have utilized data from a recently developed three-dimensional
   velocity fluctuation meter to compute the dissipation of turbulent
   kinetic energies (TRE) and the intensity of turbulent mixing in
   horizontal and vertical planes in the pelagic, epilimnic water of Lake
   Kinneret, Israel. These characteristics of wind-induced turbulent
   movement have been monitored from January 1992 through December 1996.
   The turbulence parameters were strongly correlated to wind energy
   inputs, calculated daily as 5 day cumulative inputs. There have been
   dramatic changes in the annual and seasonal development of
   phytoplankton, together with unusually high levels of primary production
   in this lake since 1994. We observed different patterns of vertical and
   horizontal turbulent movement and of TKE dissipation rates during the
   years when `unusual' phytoplankton development occurred (1994-1996)
   compared to `normal' years (1992, 1993). The first appearance of the
   filamentous cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon in this lake in
   August-September 1994 coincided with a period of markedly lower rates of
   TKE dispersion and a shift from vertical to horizontal dominance of the
   turbulent eddy spins. The absence of a regular winter-spring bloom of
   the dinoflagellate, Peridinium, in 1996 occurred when dissipation rates
   of TKE were extremely high, while record high amounts of dinoflagellates
   (1994, 1995) appeared when dissipation rates were very low. Correlations
   were shown between phytoplankton parameters (chlorophyll, primary
   production and the ratio of primary production to chlorophyll) and both
   the dissipation rate of TKE and the intensity of water turbulent mixing
   in the vertical plane. We suggest that the changes in the `turbulence
   climate' of Lake Kinneret were an important factor in determining shifts
   in phytoplankton succession and the population composition of the algal
   assemblage.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization between gray wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (Canis
   latrans) has been documented in the Great Lakes region of the United
   States and Canada but has not been extensively studied in the Rocky

   gray wolf-coyote hybridization in wolf populations in the western United
   States, Alberta, and British Columbia, including wolves reintroduced
   into Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and central Idaho. A restriction
   site and a length difference in the control region (D-loop) of mtDNA was
   used to differentiate wolf and coyote haplotypes. All 90 wolves tested
   had wolf haplotypes. We concluded that the wolf populations in the Rocky
   Mountain region have not hybridized with coyotes as they have in the
   Great Lakes region. This method could be used to test other wolf
   populations for wolf-coyote hybridization and monitor the translocated
   YNP and Idaho populations in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of a large vertebrate to regions of former range was an
   opportunity to study processes of population expansion and colonization.
   Muskoxen (Ocibos moschatus) were returned to the Arctic National
   Wildlife Refuge (Arctic NWR) in northeastern Alaska in 1969-70, after an
   absence of over 100 years., In 1982-95, I documented changes in
   distribution and abundance of muskoxen and determined the relative
   importance of calf production, survival, and emigration on abundance in
   regions first occupied. I used annual censuses, counts of sex and age
   classes, and radiotelemetry surveys to determine exponential rates of
   increase and range expansion. From 1977 to 1981, muskoxen increased ai
   an annual rate of 0.24, and calf production averaged 87 calves/100 adult
   females. From 1982 to 1986, mixed-sex groups still occupied the same
   regions, but annual rates of increase declined to 0.14 and calf
   production declined to 61 calves/100 adult females. After 1986, numbers
   of muskoxen in regions first occupied declined and may be stabilizing at
   <300 animals. Calf production continued to decline (49 calves/100 ad F
   in 1987-90 and 38 calves/100 ad F in 1991-96). Rates of calf and
   yearling survival did not decline but were negatively correlated with
   snow depth in late spring. After 1986, dispersal of mixed-sex groups
   into other regions also contributed to the decline in muskox numbers in
   regions first occupied. In 1995, 647 muskoxen were seen in the study
   area from the Sagavanirktok River to the Clarence River. Throughout the
   total range of mixed-sex groups, about 800 muskoxen were observed in the
   500 km between the Itkillik River west of Prudhoe Bay and the Babbage
   River in northwestern Canada., Muskox range expansion, population
   trends, and interactions with caribou (Rangifer tarandus) should
   continue to be monitored.}},

Abstract = {{Survival in the brown hare (Lepus curopacus) is poorly documented
   because only life tables and other nonrobust methods have been used to
   estimate constant annual survival rates. We used recent developments in
   mark-recapture analysis to model survival patterns in a Danish hare
   population monitored from 1957 to 1970. Goodness-of-fit tests revealed
   that the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model was an adequate starting point
   for adults, and age-dependence was considered in modeling survival of
   yearlings. We found no differences in annual survival rates (phi) from
   1957 to 1967 in adults, but males survived better than females
   (phi(males) = 0.55, 95\% CI = 0.50-0.61; phi(females),,,, = 0.50, 95\%
   CI = 0.44-0.56). Yearling survival rates were time dependent and varied
   with winter severity, sex, and mass. Indeed, body mass strongly
   influenced the survival of yearling hares: larger animals (greater than
   or equal to 3 kg) had higher survival rates than smaller animals, in
   both males and females (phi = 0.40-0.68 for heavy males and phi =
   0.20-0.44 for lighter males; phi = 0.31-0.52 for heavy females and phi =
   0.22-0.40 for lighter females). These variations in survival rates were
   parallel between body mass classes over time (modeled as a function of
   winter temperature) within each sex.}},

Abstract = {{Colonies of the bryozoan Pentapora fascialis (Pallas) were monitored
   photographically from January 1993 to March 1994, in two quadrats at
   depths of 11 and 22 m at Tino Island (Ligurian Sea, Italy). Colony size,
   shape, growth and mortality were analysed. Zoarial growth was measured
   as change in the two-dimensional area of substratum covered per unit
   time. Colonies ranged in size from less than 30 to 2760 cm(2). Colony
   shape was normally depressed globular, with an elliptic or subcircular
   perimeter, but tended to elongate in crowded situations. Although
   extremely variable in small colonies, growth was inversely related to
   colony size and was maximum in spring. Highest net growth rate was 211\%
   in 11 months. No recruitment was observed in the quadrats during the
   study period. Partial mortality in colonies was low and was mainly due
   to overgrowth by algae and to siltation. Physical disturbance by an
   exceptionally severe winter storm in December 1993 caused total
   mortality of almost all colonies in the shallow quadrat.}},

Abstract = {{This paper contributes to the relatively sparse literature on the
   effects of insect herbivory on the population dynamics of plants and is
   probably unique in that it reports the long-term effects of combinations
   of three insect herbivore species on the population densities of a
   moderately long-lived tree species. The tree is Sesbania punicea, a
   leguminous perennial from South America that has been the target of a
   biological control programme in South Africa for almost 20 years.
   Sixteen infestations of the weed have been monitored for periods of up
   to 10 years to determine changes in the density of the mature,
   reproductive plants under the influence of different combinations of
   three biological control agents (i.e. with one, two or three of the
   agent species present in the weed infestation). The three biological
   control agents, all weevil species, include Trichapion lativentre, which
   primarily destroys the flower-buds, Rhyssomatus marginatus, which
   destroys the developing seeds, and Neodiplogrammus quadrivittatus, whose
   larvae bore into the trunk and stems of the plants. While T. lativentre
   occurs throughout the range of the weed in South Africa, the other two
   species are less mobile, more recent introductions and are largely
   confined to the vicinity of selected release sites. There has been a
   significant decline in the density of mature S. punicea in areas where
   two or more of the agents are established. The decline of the weed has
   been most evident where N. quadrivittatus is active and particularly so
   where both of the other two weevil species are also present.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an image analysis system for the measurement of the
   average velocity of many simultaneously moving similar objects is
   described. Using a low-cost PC framegrabber, trajectories of the moving
   objects are reconstructed in real time. Average object velocity is
   derived from a statistical analysis of all trajectories generated in
   short time intervals, and a simple geometrical model describing the
   displacement of the objects. This approach avoids the need to recognize
   individual objects in consecutive frames, and so the system can be used
   for the analysis of objects that cannot be tagged individually. Spatial
   distribution of the objects is determined by counting the objects in two
   defined areas of the active window. The calculations are continuously
   repeated, which results in an on-line measurement of the average
   velocity and spatial distribution of the population, and this allows for
   the monitoring of activity in time. Applications include the measurement
   of sublethal toxic effects in static systems or in flow-through on-line
   monitoring devices. The system is illustrated with an analysis of the
   response of the waterflea Daphnia magna to changes in its environment.

Abstract = {{The activity of electron transport systems (ETS) assayed with 2-para
   (iodo-phenyl)-3(nitrophenyl)-5(phenyl) tetrazolium chloride (INT) has
   been considered to be a specific indicator of the respiration of aerobic
   microorganisms and an appropriate way to monitor such populations in
   activated sludges. We have attempted to define the conditions for
   measuring ETS activity, as well as its relevance in monitoring these
   systems. We measured INT response and quantified microorganism
   populations in activated sludges under extreme conditions, such as
   oxygen starvation and deflocculation. We also measured the INT response
   in each of the following microbial populations: aerobic bacteria,
   anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria, protozoans, and metazoans, as well as
   in fragments of disrupted bacteria. The results reveal that strictly
   anaerobic bacteria in activated sludge also have a positive response to
   the INT rest, which increases when flocs are dissociated or bacteria are
   disrupted. The INT reagent seems to have limited access to electron
   transport chains. The INT test in activated sludges thus does not appear
   to be suitable for monitoring the metabolism of aerobic heterotrophic
   bacteria, their principal population. The INT test therefore seems to be
   inappropriate for detecting a shift towards anaerobiosis. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Physical damage to saplings is considered an important factor that
   affects tree population dynamics in tropical forests, but interspecific
   differences in post-damage vegetative recovery and survival have been
   rarely quantified. Over 4 years, the vegetative and demographic
   responses to experimental mechanical damage were monitored in
   naturally-growing saplings of four coexisting tree species, under
   comparable overhead illumination conditions, in a lowland moist forest
   in Central Panama. Inflicted damage mimicked both crown loss and stem
   breakage ('snapped') and stem pinning by fallen debris ('bent') in
   individuals (1.0-2.5 m tall) of Alseis blackiana (Rubiaceae), Protium
   panamense, P. tenuifolium, and Tetragastris panamensis (all
   Burseraceae). For all species combined, 4-year percent mortality was
   significantly different between bent (21\%), snapped (13\%), and
   undamaged controls (6\%). Species differed in their capacity to survive
   damage. Saplings of A. blackiana showed the highest resilience,
   expressed as a high ability to regain pre-damage height in snapped
   individuals, production of adventitious roots in bent individuals, and
   very high survival. A previous classification of the study species fit
   them into a large `generalist' guild, after no illumination preferences
   were obvious for their juvenile growth and survival at the study site.
   In contrast, this study suggests that tree vegetative behavior should be
   incorporated in future tropical forest research that attempts to detect
   species differentiation in regeneration potential at the sapling phase.

Abstract = {{Overall, 217 lions (>1 year) Panthera leo (Linnaeus) and 2069 spotted
   hyaenas (>8 mo) Crocuta crocuta (Erxleben) responded to broadcast
   vocalizations, call-ins, during six surveys in the Masai Mara National
   Reserve, Kenya.
   Carnivore response varied seasonally and was significantly higher and
   more uniform when migratory prey were absent, Variation in wildebeest
   abundance, by affecting food availability, was the only significant
   predictor of response, Variability in response with overall prey
   abundance was higher for lions than hyaenas, Lion response occurred
   within a radius of 2.5 km, was independent of age and sex but dropped
   virtually to zero whenever lions possessed a carcass at the time of
   broadcasting.
   An independent total census recorded 547 lions (all ages) in the
   Reserve, 9.96\% of which were nomads. This proportion increased by
   7.94\% following the influx of migrants and raised lion (>1 year)
   density from 0.292 to 0.320 lions/km(2). The call-in estimate of 0.294
   +/- 0.009 (95\% c.l.) lions/km(2) practically equalled the total count.
   The high precision and low bias (-0.224\%) of this estimate imply that
   call-in surveys are reliable and may be employed to effectively monitor
   carnivore populations in the long term. Under simple random sampling,
   covering about 20\% of an area would seem adequate to produce reliable
   density estimates.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment designed to study the effects of habitat fragmentation on
   biological diversity in the montane grasslands of Southern Africa was
   launched in September 1994, The Groenvaly experiment is positioned on
   the western slopes of the Drakensberg escarpment in Mpumalanga, South
   Africa, The hypotheses being tested are: (1) that fragmentation reduces
   biological diversity; (2) that fragmentation alters community
   composition (invasion): (3) that the reduction in diversity is dependent
   on fragment size; (4) that species viability is differentially affected
   by distances between fragments; and (5) that afforestation causes
   irreversible community change. In addition, the experiment evaluates the
   relevance of mainland-island, metapopulation and source-sink models for
   describing the population characteristics of the grassland taxa. The
   experimental design comprises two fragment sizes (0.25 and 1.5 ha)
   replicated 12 times. Six replicates were retained as grassland fragments
   surrounded by newly established Pinus elliottii plantations. A further
   six replicates served as control fragments in an adjacent designated
   grassland conservation area. Sampling to monitor community composition
   (vegetation, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, arachnida, small mammals) and the
   population dynamics (mark-recapture) of selected taxa (small mammals to
   date) was conducted. Monitoring of the population dynamics of selected
   Coleoptera and Orthoptera taxa, identified as suitable models for
   further study, and the soil micro-fauna in fragments will commence in
   1997. Two years following plantation establishment effective
   fragmentation has not yet been achieved. However, the analysis of
   pre-treatment data is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   experimental design. The analyses suggest that there is a sound basis
   for future interpretation of experimental results because no significant
   differences between the experimental and control plots were detected.
   The presence of some variation within experimental and control plots
   underscores the importance of adequate replication in ecological field
   experiments, a strength of the experimental design employed here. (C)

Abstract = {{Major subsystems of the terrestrial phosphorus cycle on the densely
   populated, 142 ha motu of Fogafale, are: carbonate substrate (similar to
   10(3) g P t(-1)), groundwater (similar to 0.4 g P t(-1)), terrestrial
   flora (similar to 0.22 t P ha(-1)) and fauna (similar to 18 kg P
   ha(-1)). Freshwater provides the principal medium for terrestrial
   geochemical atoll processes and is the central recycling plant for
   phosphorus from atmospheric fallout and decomposition of biotic waste.
   Present data cannot determine precise fluxes within and between all
   subsystems, but perturbations, resulting from increasing human
   populations and changing land use, may be estimated. Changes in
   Fogafale's biotic phosphorus capitals and increasing
   phosphorus-containing imports have skewed fluxes and transfer routes of
   biogenic waste. Atolls are dynamic systems, able to recover from
   environmental disruptions, but the sustainability and effectiveness of
   underlying biogeochemical cycles require quantification, monitoring and
   nurturing. In particular, the integrity of Fogafale's essential fresh
   groundwater needs to be ascertained and protected.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive cycle of a natural population of grooved carpet-shell
   clam, Tapes decussatus, on the coast of northwest Spain was monitored
   over a year-long period. Gametogenic activity was characterized on the
   basis of stereological analysis of the gonads. In both sexes, ripe
   gametes were continually present and continually released between April
   and August; spawning efficiency over this period was 60\% in females and
   83\% in males. Again in both sexes, major spawning occurred in
   August/September (spawning efficiency 94\% in females, 86\% in males).
   In parallel with monitoring of gametogenic activity, energy storage was
   also monitored, by staining the visceral-gonadal mass for glycogen alpha
   (rapid-access glycogen), glycogen beta (protein-bound glycogen), and
   acid and neutral lipids. The principal storage areas are muscle tissue,
   vesicular cells and the digestive gland. Muscle tissue stores and
   utilizes protein-bound glycogen during the resting period and at the
   start of gametogenesis, while rapid-access glycogen appears in this
   tissue only during the gamete ripening period. In vesicular cells,
   protein-bound glycogen bodies (diameter 1-3 mu m, up to 6 per cell)
   accumulate throughout the resting period; as gametogenesis progresses,
   these are transformed to triacylglycerides (bodies of about 5-9 mu m in
   diameter, up to 5 per cell), which are subsequently transferred to
   oocytes (bodies of up to 14 mu m in diameter). In the digestive gland,
   rapid-access glycogen is present throughout the year, while
   triacylglyceride bodies (diameter 2-15 mu m) accumulate over the period
   of gamete ripening. Acidic lipid inclusions (about 1 mu m in diameter,
   probably corresponding to membrane phospholipids) are observed along the
   borders of muscle fibres, gonadal follicles, vesicular cells and their
   nuclei, haemocytes and cells of the gastric diverticles. Haemocytes
   transport both glycogen fractions, and are observed: (a) between muscle
   fibres, (b) adhering to the external wall of gonadal follicles and
   within follicles, (c) adhering to the external wall of gastric
   diverticles and within diverticles, and (d) adhering to ripening
   oocytes. Stereological analysis likewise allowed evaluation of seasonal
   variation in the volume fraction (VF) occupied by vesicular cells. The
   period of peak vesicular-cell VF (October/November; VF 32\% in females,
   36\% in males, 30\% in indeterminate individuals) coincided with that of
   peak intracellular glycogen levels. Minimum vesicular-cell VF were
   observed during the gamete ripening period (VF 2-8\% in females, 0\% in
   males). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Sturgeon lack external sexual dimorphism and have longer-than-annual
   ovarian cycles. Using gonadal biopsy of marked fish, we identified sex
   and monitored ovarian development in one cohort of cultured Siberian
   sturgeon over the age interval 8.5-12.5 year Sex ratio in the population
   did not differ from 1:1 (268 females and 286 males). Each November, the
   females were separated into two groups: one with ovarian follicle
   diameter greater than or equal to 2.8 mm (Group 2, spawnable) and
   another with smaller follicles in previtellogenic or vitellogenic growth
   (Group 1). During the 5 year period of observations, 11.2 \% of the
   initial 268 females were lost. The oocytes of Group 2 exhibited
   migratory germinal vesicle but its position in animal hemisphere was not
   peripheral in November. The annual changes in proportions of Group 2
   females, from 34.6 to 63.3 \%, reflected ovarian cycles of different
   duration. Majority of 196 females, matured two or mole times during a
   period of study. exhibited biennial ovarian cycle or recurring cycles of
   I and 2 years in the same individual. Annual and triennial cycles were
   also observed. Some abnormalities in oocyte pigmentation are described.

Abstract = {{A hazardous-waste-treatment plant that housed an incinerator began
   operation in 1984, before which a baseline survey of the surrounding
   population and environment was conducted; 10 y later, investigators

   because mercury concentrations were present in the stack emissions, and
   environmental monitoring revealed mercury concentrations near the plant.
   In 1984 and 1994 the median hair mercury concentrations were 0.5 mg/kg
   and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively. During the 10-y period, median hair total
   mercury concentrations increased by 0.35 mg/kg in workers (n = 11); by
   0.16 mg/kg, 0.13 mg/kg, and 0.03 mg/kg in individuals who lived 2 km (n

Abstract = {{Fish mercury concentrations were monitored before and after the
   construction of the La Grande hydroelectric complex, located in the
   James Bay region, Quebec, Canada. Monitoring results revealed that
   sympatric populations of dwarf and normal lake whitefish (Coregonus
   clupeaformis) occur in reservoirs and natural lakes of the area. Dwarf
   specimens bioaccumulate mercury more rapidly than normal individuals. In
   natural Serigny Lake, 6-7 year old dwarf specimens show mean total
   mercury levels 1.5 times higher than normal individuals of the same age
   (0.33 vs 0.21 mg kg(-1) wet weight). Eleven years after the impoundment
   of the Caniapiscau reservoir, 6-7 year old dwarf specimens show total
   mercury concentrations 3 times higher than normal specimens of similar
   ages (0.74 vs 0.27 mg kg(-1)). Stomach content analysis showed that
   although large normal individuals feed on different prey than do dwarf
   individuals, similar methyl mercury levels were found in prey of both
   forms. We suggest that dwarf individuals bioaccumulate mercury more
   rapidly than normal specimens because they begin to mature at an earlier
   age (usually at age 2 to 3 compared to age 6 for normal specimens) and
   thus produce proportionally less flesh to dilute the mercury
   assimilated. Total mercury analysis indicating higher concentrations in
   flesh than in gonads support this hypothesis. Our results suggest that
   when monitoring mercury levels in fish in areas where populations of
   dwarf and normal lake whitefish coexist, dwarf and normal specimens must
   be distinguished because of their different bioaccumulation rates.}},

Abstract = {{Two populations of Zostera marina L. were monitored over one year
   (February 1994-February 1995) in two Mediterranean shallow coastal
   areas: the lagoons of Thau (southern France) and Venice (north-eastern
   Italy), which differ in morphological and hydrological (water depth,
   tides and water exchanges) characteristics. Significant differences of
   salinity (Thau: 36.0 +/- 3.2 PSU, Venice: 30.5 +/- 2.0 PSU) and nutrient
   concentrations in the water column (dissolved inorganic nitrogen, DIN:
   69.0 +/- 24.5 and 14.4. +/- 8.6 mu M, reactive phosphorus, RP: 2.51 +/-
   1.97 and 0.43 +/- 0.19 mu M at Thau and Venice, respectively) and pore
   water (DIN: 380 +/- 192 and 522 +/- 238 mu M, RP: 10.3 +/- 9.3 and 27.6
   +/- 11.6 mu M) were found. On a yearly basis, Z. marina displayed
   moderate variations at Thau (shoot biomass: 241-1350 g FW m(-2), shoot
   number: 103-235 shoots m(-2)) and a marked growth trend at Venice
   (biomass: 504-3321 g FW m(-2), shoot number: 393-1093 shoots m(-2)). The
   comparison between the growth (Thau: April-September, Venice:
   May-October) and the dormancy periods in the two populations was
   computed by the principal component analysis on the basis of the main
   contribution of salinity and nitrogen compunds at Thau, temperature,
   biomass and nutrient availability at Venice. Both eelgrass beds were
   characterized by perennial populations (persistence of overwintering
   shoots) but the quick increase of biomass by vegetative and reproductive
   shoots induced a semi-annual feature for seagrasses at Venice. In spite
   of the remarkably different nutrient availabilities in the water of the
   two lagoons, nutrient contents of Z. marina (total nitrogen and
   phosphorus) exhibited a similar seasonal pattern characterized by higher
   levels in leaves (total nitrogen, TN: 1.72 +/- 0.67 and 2.34 +/- 0.45\%
   DW; total phosphorus, TP: 0.24 +/- 0.05 and 0.23 +/- 0.08\% DW at Thau
   and Venice, respectively) than in roots-rhizomes (TN:1.12 +/- 0.59 and
   1.23 +/- 0.27\% DW, TP: 0.17 +/- 0.04 and 0.10 +/- 0.02\% DW at Thau and
   Venice respectively).}},

Abstract = {{A primary goal of all management plans is to increase population size or
   growth without harming wild stocks. Stock enhancement is one of many
   tools available for restoration of depleted populations and should be
   evaluated before implementation with other conservation plans such as
   habitat restoration and harvest controls. For many late-maturing
   species, an increase in juvenile cohort size does not necessarily
   increase population growth significantly, even if hatchery juveniles
   survive and grow well and do not adversely affect wild stocks.
   Management efforts that focus on reestablishing healthy adult stocks and
   protecting subadults may restore declining populations more effectively.
   Managers can anticipate the effects of particular management plans or
   enhancement efforts by means of population models. As an example, we
   review an analysis of the Kemp's ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempi)
   ``headstarting{''} enhancement effort. Because sea turtles have delayed
   maturity and were declining primarily because of incidental drowning of
   large juveniles and adults in shrimp trawls, captive-rearing and release
   efforts were (and still are) unlikely to have an appreciable effect on
   population growth rates, even if headstarted turtles have the same
   survival and growth rates as wild turtles. Population models and
   life-history analysis can be very useful for establishing performance
   criteria and evaluation methods as well as for choosing management
   options that are likely to be effective. We conclude by suggesting that
   prognostic modeling should be one component of the improved science of
   enhancement, which also includes establishing of specific goals,
   hypothesis testing, monitoring, and evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The dramatic decline of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.)
   populations in Newfoundland over the past 100 years presents an
   opportunity to determine and monitor population bottleneck effects on
   genetic diversity in trees. To provide benchmarks and indicators for
   monitoring genetic changes due to recent and future bottleneck events
   and to assist development of conservation strategies, we assessed
   genetic diversity and structure of six small, isolated white pine
   populations from two regions at the limits of its geographical range in
   Newfoundland for comparison with three populations from its central
   range in Ontario for 20 allozyme loci coding for 12 enzymes. On average,
   47.8\% of the loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus was
   1.75, and the observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.215 and
   0.195, respectively. Although most of the alleles were widespread,
   unique alleles were found in three of the nine populations examined. The
   Newfoundland populations were as genetically variable as those from
   Ontario. Generally, all populations exhibited slight excess of
   heterozygotes at most loci. Only 6.1\% of the detected genetic variation
   was among populations, and the remainder among individuals within
   populations. The genetic distances among the populations within a
   province or region were as great as those among populations between the
   provinces or regions. Canonical discriminant functions and cluster
   analysis from genetic distances separated nine populations into the same
   four groups. Neither provincial nor regional or geographic
   gradient-related patterns of population variation and differentiation
   were apparent. It appears that 8000 years of postglacial geographic
   isolation and recent population decline have had little or no detectable
   effect on genetic diversity or differentiation of disjunct Newfoundland
   white pine populations from their ancestral mainland populations.
   Assuming their adaptability, the Ontario seed sources may be acceptable
   for white pine restoration in Newfoundland.}},

Abstract = {{Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) transplanted from the
   Sacramento River, California, U.S.A., to New Zealand in the 1900s
   colonized many South Island rivers, which now show significant
   population-specific phenotypic variation. To characterize this
   variation, we conducted a morphometric analysis of two New Zealand
   populations and the fan-run Battle Creek population at the Coleman
   Hatchery, the apparent ancestral stock. Variation in length at age,
   weight at length, fin lengths, hump depth, snout length, and caudal
   peduncle width was detected among populations. Sexually mature Battle
   Creek and New Zealand chinook salmon were consistently identifiable from
   morphometric data (97.7\% classification accuracy), largely through
   differences in caudal peduncle width and hump depth. The two New Zealand
   spawning populations, although distinguishable in morphology in 1994
   (mean of 80\% correct classification), did not classify as well using
   the same discriminant functions in 1995 (mean of 62.7\% correct),
   suggesting interannual multivariate effects. Little variation was
   observed between the two mainstem river populations in adults collected
   shortly after entering freshwater. Although the genetic or environmental
   causes for the differences between populations have yet to be
   determined, our results provide empirical evidence of phenotypic
   divergence over decadal time scales. This work may be relevant to
   considerations in the development and monitoring of salmon recovery and
   conservation programs.}},

Abstract = {{Many small mammals lose body mass in the fall and winter. Laboratory
   studies suggest that the cause of this varies from individual to
   individual, at least in meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. The short
   day lengths of fall induce this adaptation in some individuals,
   presumably to promote winter survival. Other individuals, side-by-side
   neighbors, are insensitive to this cue; they enter winter with a larger
   body mass that they may not be able to maintain if conditions become too
   harsh. A long-held assumption is that the photoregulated loss of mass
   allows energy to be conserved by decreasing the amount of food required
   for survival and, thus, decreasing foraging time. The present experiment
   tested the hypothesis that smaller, photoresponsive meadow voles do
   indeed consume less food and spend less time feeding than larger
   individuals, which are not photoresponsive. This hypothesis was tested
   in conditions meant to simulate some of the energy challenges faced by
   voles at the onset of winter. Representatives of each phenotype were
   housed in cages in which they had to leave their nests in order to feed,
   and in which food intake and time spent feeding could be monitored. At
   25 degrees C the two groups did not differ in either food intake or time
   spent feeding; the smaller animals required more food per gram of body
   mass. Food quality was reduced and, later, ambient temperature was
   decreased to 3 degrees C. Food intake and feeding time were again almost
   identical in the two groups. It is suggested that the hypothesis failed
   to find support in this experiment because it does not take into account
   the higher thermoregulatory costs associated with a decrease in size.}},

   were absent or scarce in the Hudson River before September 1992, but
   abundant (mean 17000/m(2)) on hard substrata in 1993-1995 and
   responsible for large declines in phytoplankton biomass. All of our
   monitoring stations had soft sediments, and so had low local densities
   of zebra mussels (mean 78/m(2)). Nevertheless, we observed marked
   changes in the macrozoobenthos at these stations. Sphaeriid clams
   declined by 67\% between 1990-1992 and 1993-1995, but no other group of
   macrobenthos showed a simple change in density between 1990-1992 and
   1993-1995 across all eight monitoring sites. Instead, most taxa showed a
   strong interaction between zebra mussel impacts and water depth. At
   deep-water sites, macrozoobenthic density declined by 33\% between
   1990-1992 and 1993-1995, while at shallow-water sites, density rose by
   25\%. We suggest that these changes were probably caused by reduced
   sedimentation of edible particles at deep-water sites combined with
   increased biomass of macrophytes and attached algae at shallow-water
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to assess the microenvironment in
   separately ventilated mouse cages at differing ventilation rates, mice
   populations, and frequency of bedding changes. We monitored intracage
   temperature, relative humidity, and concentrations of ammonia and carbon
   dioxide during 3 experiments. First, the effect of ventilation rate on
   the microenvironment of cages housing adult male mice was evaluated at
   30, 40, 60, 80 and 100 air changes/h. For all ventilation rates tested,
   ammonia concentration was less than 3 ppm, carbon dioxide concentration
   ranged from 840 to 3,300 ppm, relative humidity ranged from 42 to 65\%,
   and temperature ranged from 23.2 to 25.3 degrees C. Second, we monitored
   cage microenvironment continually in experiments during which changing
   of bedding was delayed. Male mice were used in the experiment, and cages
   were ventilated (60 air changes/h). Cages were allowed to accumulate
   soiled material for 26 days, during which time ammonia concentration and
   relative humidity did not exceed 10 ppm and 45\%, respectively. Third,
   we tested ventilation rate and frequency of bedding changes in
   ventilated cages containing breeding trios (2 females, I male) and their
   pups. Ammonia concentrations remained at 25 ppm or less for 30, 60, and
   100 air changes/h when bedding was changed weekly and for 100 air
   changes/h when bedding was changed every 2 weeks. We concluded that 30
   air changes/h was sufficient to maintain a healthful microenvironment in
   cages that were housing adult male mice in which bedding was changed
   weekly. When frequency of bedding changes was reduced to every 2 weeks,
   60 air changes/h was sufficient for cages housing adult males, but 100
   air changes/h was necessary for cages housing breeding trios and pups.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical surveillance comprises methods for repeated analysis of
   stochastic processes, aiming to detect a change in the underlying
   distribution. Such methods are widely used for industrial, medical,
   economic and other applications. By applying these general methods to
   data collected for environmetrical purposes, it might be possible to
   detect important changes fast and reliably. We exemplify the use of
   statistical surveillance on a data set of fish catches in Lake Malaren,
   Sweden, 1964-93. A model for the `in control' process of one species,
   vendace (Coregonus albula), is constructed and used for univariate
   monitoring. Further, we demonstrate the application of Hotelling's T-2
   and the Shannon-Wiener index for monitoring biodiversity, where a set of
   five economically interesting species serve as bioindicators for the
   lake. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Part of a recently advocated method of sustainable forest development
   employs indicator species as fine filters to assess changes within
   ecosystems and landscapes. We used a series of criteria based on
   biology, sampling methods, and legal or particular status to select
   vertebrate indicator species for the province of Ontario. The criteria
   for selection were applied in a hierarchical manner, with species
   ecology given primary importance, followed by sampling considerations,
   and status criteria. The latter represented certain societal weightings
   and political or featured management concerns. Species fitting the
   selection criteria were placed in a four-dimensional matrix (with axes:
   broad habitat type, age class, trophic level, and spatial scale), and
   species were then chosen from among the matrix cells. The exercise
   reduced the total vertebrate species in two forest biomes (Boreal and
   Great-Lakes St. Lawrence) to a relative few, from which the final
   choices were made primarily based on expert opinion. In Ontario, the
   species selected as indicators of biological diversity will be used to
   test the underlying general hypothesis that forest management has no
   effect on species richness and species abundance, or the distribution of
   species in time and space.}},

Title = {{The distribution of dippers, Cinclus cinclus (L.), in the acid-sensitive

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{1. Dippers were surveyed along seventy-four acid-sensitive streams in
   upland Wales in 1984 and again in 1995. At forty-eight of the sites, and
   in an additional twenty-three to twenty-nine adjacent catchments,
   changes in acid-base status and macroinvertebrate communities were
   assessed. River habitat surveys (RHS) and GIS (Geographical Information
   System) provided information on habitat features.
   2. pH means across all the sites were higher on average by 0.12 pH units
   in 1995 than 1984, accompanied by significantly increased total hardness
   and reduced sulphate. However, geometric mean aluminium concentrations
   increased significantly, while the abundances of important dipper prey
   either remained constant (Ephemeroptera) or declined (Trichoptera;
   Plecoptera).
   3. As in 1984, dipper distribution in 1995 was related to acid-base
   status: aluminium concentrations were significantly higher, and pH
   significantly lower, at sites where dippers were absent. In both
   surveys, there were significantly more bankside broadleaves and fewer
   conifers where dippers were present.
   4. Although dippers occurred in 1995 on a similar number of streams as
   in 1984, there were both gains and losses, and an overall significant
   reduction in the number of visits on which birds were recorded (=
   registrations) per survey reach. Gains and losses were not related to
   habitat structure or acid-base status, and might be stochastic. Mean
   aluminium concentrations increased more (P < 0.06) at sites where dipper
   registrations fell, than where they increased, but changes were large
   enough to explain altered occupancy at only five sites. Plecopteran
   abundances declined most at sites losing birds.
   5. We conclude that recovery from acidification has not yet been large
   or sustained enough to allow widescale increase in the Welsh dipper
   population, and continued decline cannot be excluded. There is a need
   for better understanding of how recovery processes will permeate

Abstract = {{1, Eleven contiguous mixed-species bird flocks, with colour-banded
   individuals, were monitored continuously during 3 years in a 137-ha
   study area of primary rainforest in French Guiana.
   2, Flock members were divided into six categories according to their
   flocking propensity and occurrence: 10 core or permanent species and 56
   regular, occasional or incidental species. Each core species was
   represented by a single breeding pair with their fledglings and extra
   `floaters' (unmated subadults and adults).
   3, Flock home ranges overlapped slightly, but were communally defended
   by all core species in areas of overlap. Their size varied from 3.2 to
   14.3 ha and was inversely correlated with vegetation density, but not
   flock size or species composition.
   4, Flock number, size and composition, as well as boundaries were highly
   stable between seasons and years. Each flock had a single permanent
   gathering site and bathing site in late afternoon, the latter sometimes
   shared by 2-3 flocks.
   5, Core species produced 0.18-0.73 fledglings per pair per year, which
   stayed in their natal flock for 200 to over 421 days. Then, these
   individuals usually moved between two and six different flocks,
   sometimes for up to 3 years, before finding a mate and a flock where
   they could settle and breed. Once breeding, they probably remained for
   life in the same flock. The mean annual survival rate was at least 0.75,
   6, This highly evolved and stable organization, associated with a low
   breeding success and high survival rate was a critical factor
   maintaining low species density, delayed reproduction and a proportion
   of floating individuals buffering population fluctuations.
   7, These social groups with their multi-species territoriality and
   co-evolved roles of flock members were similar to those described
   elsewhere in South America. They seem to be a general phenomenon in
   neotropical lowland rainforests.}},

Title = {{The response of wild Atlantic salmon parr to acute reductions in water
   flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1, A seasonal reduction in water flow. due both to prevailing weather
   conditions and anthropogenic disturbance. is a prominent feature of the
   habitat in many riverine systems, yet the response of many aquatic
   vertebrates, such as juvenile Atlantic salmon, to low flows is not well
   understood. However, in accordance with general fitness optimization
   theory, it might be predicted that salmon will emigrate from shallow
   areas to seek refuge in pools as water levels decrease to critically low
   levels (fitness approaches zero). To test this prediction, we directly
   measured the movement response of individual Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar L.) (74-109 mm) to drought in near-natural mesocosms.
   2, In five separate trials during summer, groups of salmon were
   introduced into enclosed 30-m long sections of stream, each comprising a
   central 10-m long region of shallow riffle habitat bordered upstream and
   downstream by 10-m long regions of deeper water. After fish had settled
   into home ranges, those fish inhabiting deep areas were removed and the
   water flow was later decreased to zero over 2 days, so that the riffles
   were nearly dry. The movements of each individual fish within the
   enclosures were: monitored remotely and continuously using a passive
   integrated transponder (PIT) tracking system.
   3, Of the total of 33 fish with home ranges that included only riffle
   habitat, 14 moved into deep water at some point during drought, but only
   seven of these fish (0-50\% between trials) established new home ranges
   that included deep areas. The others returned to regions of riffle
   during the drought. None of the eight fish that definitely had not
   sampled in pool habitat prior to settling on riffle emigrated during
   drought.
   4. The optimal response of salmon parr to moderate natural drought
   appears not to be fixed, but for many individual fish it may be to stay
   in shallow riffle areas. The optimal response of salmon parr to extreme
   natural drought and anthropogenic de-watering will, in many cases, be to
   move. An increase within the population of traits that promote an ideal
   response to natural drought will therefore make it more vulnerable to
   severe drought and anthropogenic de-watering and vice versa.
   5, The absence of emigration by salmon from shallow areas during acute
   drought can be reconciled with fitness optimization theory if, when
   natural drought progresses, fish become stranded in shallow areas some
   considerable time before the point at which they die.}},

Abstract = {{The impart of nonpoint-source pollution on surface waters in
   agricultural watersheds is an emerging environmental issue, As part of
   the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment program in
   the Hudson River Basin, Canajoharie Creek was monitored for seasonal and
   spatial patterns of nutrient chemistry from March 1993 to January 1996.
   Nitrate and silica concentrations in Canajoharie Creek suggest that
   seasonal and spatial variations of these nutrients are dominated by
   biological processes, particularly uptake by phytoplankton, Observed
   concentration patterns were more typical of those observed in much
   larger, low-gradient streams, The median nitrate and silica
   concentrations in Canajoharie Creek were significantly lower from April
   through November than during winter. Concentrations of both constituents
   declined downstream from the headwaters during base-now conditions in
   June 1995. Groundwater and surface water chemistry data support
   biological causes for downstream decreases in silica. The strong
   correlation between nitrate and silica in samples collected along the
   mainstem suggests that most of the nitrate decrease is due to uptake by
   diatoms. Downstream patterns of chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton strongly
   suggest the conversion of in-stream nutrients to algal biomass, Data
   collected from Canajoharie Creek outlet during the northeast drought of
   1995 indicate that silica concentrations in May had possibly declined to
   a level that adversely affected the diatom community, This decline in
   the diatom population and subsequent resurgence is inferred from a sharp
   rise in silica concentrations between May and July and a reversal of
   this trend from mid-July through October without associated changes in
   hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of the Crested Caracara (Caracara plancus) was
   studied during the 1990 and 1991 breeding seasons in Baja California
   Sur, Mexico. Sixteen nests were monitored in 1990 and six in 1991. The
   breeding season extended from February-August. Caracaras were more
   abundant during the post-fledging period (October-November) when up to
   1.2 birds/km were registered in road surveys. The cardon cactus
   (Pachycereus pringlei) was the most used structure for nesting (76\% of
   nests), although other tree-like structures were also used. Nest
   material consisted mainly of twigs of rama parda (Ruellia peninsularis),
   coralvine (Antigonon leptopus) and condalia (Condalia globosa). Nesting
   success estimated using the Mayfield method was 0.75 and 0.38 in 1990
   and 1991, respectively Mean (+/-SD) productivity was 2.2 +/- 0.4 and 1.8
   +/- 0.7 fledglings per successful nest in 1990 and 1991, respectively.
   Five second clutches were registered. The productivity of the Cape
   region Crested Caracara population was similar to that reported for
   caracaras in Texas but higher than in Arizona.}},

Abstract = {{Rainbow trout were experimentally infected with the ectoparasitic
   monogenean Gyrodactylus derjavini at three temperatures, 5.5 degrees C,
   11.6 degrees C and 18.7 degrees C. Subsequently, the infection level was
   monitored during the following 6 weeks. The population growth was
   positively correlated with temperature in the initial part of the
   investigation. At 18.7 degrees C growth of the parasite population was
   fast reaching a peak abundance within 3 weeks, whereafter the infection
   level decreased significantly. Peak abundance was recorded in week 5 at
   11.6 degrees C. A very slow but steady parasite reproduction was noted
   at 5.5 degrees C, but no peak abundance was reached within 6 weeks. The
   decline in parasite population after reaching peak levels is likely to
   be caused by a host response. The host response is also indicated by the
   parasites' active selection of particular microhabitats. This
   anti-monogenean response developed fastest at 18.7 degrees C, more
   slowly at 11.6 degrees C and was not recorded within 6 weeks at 5.5
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Runneling, a type of habitat modification using shallow channels, is an
   effective method for controlling mosquitoes that breed in intertidal
   salt marshes. Grapsid crab populations were studied to assess the
   environmental effects of runneling on nontarget species. Pitfall traps
   provided a means of monitoring crab distribution and relative abundance
   at Coomera Island in southeastern Queensland. The study indicated that
   although runneling does not have a significant effect on the total
   number of crabs, it may have a significant impact on species
   distribution. Significantly greater numbers of Parasesarma
   erythrodactyla were found at the runneled site. In contrast, Helograpsus
   haswellianus was more abundant at the unrunneled control site.
   Associations were also found between species abundance, distance from
   the tidal inlet, and vegetation type. Helograpsus haswellianus was
   associated with mixed vegetation, whereas Parasesarma erythrodactyla was
   associated with tall, dense salt marsh couch. No correlation was found
   between the number of crab burrows present at the study site and the
   number of crabs caught in the traps. However, the runneled site had
   approximately twice the number of crab burrows of the unrunneled control
   site. These results were consistent for 3 consecutive monthly sampling
   periods. The method has proven suitable for further studies on the
   long-term environmental impact of runneling.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a 4-yr study are reported. Data from Surber-samples of 3
   running waters in southern France were compared with results from field
   enclosure experiments. Egg development lasted about one month under
   field conditions and two weeks at 25 degrees C in the laboratory. O.
   uncartus has usually but not strictly 13 larval instars and a 3-yr life
   cycle. Each year emergence started in early June. The emergence curve
   was typical of a summer sp. Several aspects of seasonal regulation are
   discussed. The monitoring of population structure indicated a high
   mortality of final instar larvae (up to 99\%) during winter. This
   mortality differed between the sample sites of one of-the running
   waters. These differences depend on prey availability and on larval
   density. A field enclosure experiment revealed density dependence of
   larval size and growth.}},

Abstract = {{A worldwide collection of P. parasitica isolates was investigated for
   the ability to infect tobacco and tomato, as related to elicitin
   production. Elicitin was produced by all nontobacco isolates, and
   nonproducing strains all were isolated from tobacco. In addition,
   producing strains were isolated from tobacco and coexisted with
   nonproducing (TE-) strains. Elicitin production generally was associated
   with low virulence on tobacco and frequent pathogenicity on tomato,
   whereas TE- isolates generally were highly virulent and specialized to
   tobacco. Analysis of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA restriction
   fragment length polymorphisms indicated, for the first time, that black
   shank isolates can be distinguished from other P. parasitica isolates on
   the basis of genetic criteria. Our results suggest that severe black
   shank is caused by a limited number of TE- strains that have been
   disseminated by clonal evolution. Mutations in the TE- phenotype seem to
   have arisen independently in several genetic backgrounds and distinct
   geographic areas. The fortuitous absence of elicitin production has
   precluded population replacements in areas of intensive tobacco
   cultivation. Thus, monitoring the loss of elicitin production in
   developing tobacco areas should be considered in disease management.}},

Abstract = {{DNA samples from Magnaporthe grisea isolates were fingerprinted by using
   repetitive element-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) with two
   outwardly directed primer sequences from Pod an element found in
   approximately 100 copies in the fungal genome. Variable length
   fragments, defining the sequences lying between these elements, were
   generated, and fingerprint patterns specific for individual strains were
   established. ``Long PCR{''} conditions, including higher pH (9.2) and
   increased extension time (10 min) were used to amplify DNA fragments
   ranging from 400 bp to longer than 23 kb. Polymorphisms specific to M.
   grisea strains were generated, allowing inference of their genetic
   relationships. Segregation analysis was used to confirm single-locus
   inheritance for the fragments amplified by rep-PCR. Cluster analysis
   revealed robust groupings that corresponded to previously determined
   MGR586 restriction fragment length polymorphism lineages of the
   rice-infecting strains of the pathogen. We have also demonstrated the
   utility of rep-PCR to differentiate isolates that infect rice from those
   that infect nonrice hosts. DNA fingerprinting by Pot2 rep-PCR provides
   an efficient means to monitor the population dynamics of the blast
   pathogen. Because of the method's low cost and ease in application, it
   is now feasible to conduct large-scale population studies to understand
   the impact of host genotypes on pathogen evolution.}},

   reported catch has been recorded since 1980. Harbour porpoises are
   mainly caught between April and November, with a peak during June to
   October. Five fish species, crustaceans and squids have been found in
   stomach contents of harbour porpoises in Greenlandic waters. There are
   no indications that environmental issues such as organochlorines, heavy
   metals, oil or noise have constituted any threat to harbour porpoises in
   Greenland. No reports of ice entrapments of harbour porpoises have yet
   been made in Greenland, as is the case for white whales and narwhals on
   the west coast of Greenland. Disease patterns of harbour porpoise have
   not been studied in Greenland and incidents of mass mortality have never
   been recorded. Killer whales are sparse along the west Greenland coast
   and are not believed to constitute a threat to the harbour porpoise
   population. In Greenland no estimates on stock size are available, and a
   monitoring programme is needed if the impact of the catch is to be
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Seeds of the geographically-widespread Solidago altissima and S.
   nemoralis and the narrow-endemic S. shortii were buried in pots of soil
   and placed in a glasshouse without temperature control. After 0.3-4.3
   years of burial, some seeds (21-60\%) of all three species were viable
   and they germinated to 75-100\% during 2 weeks of incubation in light at
   30/15 degrees C. Soil samples collected from several population sites of
   S. altissima, S. nemoralis and S. shortii were placed in the glasshouse
   and monitored for seedling emergence. During the first, second, third,
   fourth, fifth and sixth springs, the number of S. altissima seedlings
   m(-2) emerging was 108-1080, 8-494, 0-520, 0-69, 0-6 and 3,
   respectively, of S. nemoralis was 108-1122, 17-667, 0-42, 0-6, 0 and 0,
   respectively, and of S. shortii was 61-1753, 0-25, 0-6, 0, 0 and 0,
   respectively. More seedlings emerged from disturbed than from
   non-disturbed soil, but the differences were not significant. Thus,
   although some seeds of all three species buried in pots remained viable
   in soil throughout the 4.3-year burial period, longevity was greater and
   size of seed bank larger in field-collected soil samples containing
   seeds of the geographically-widespread species than in those containing
   seeds of the narrow endemic. Although 34 studies have reported seeds of
   17 species of Solidago present in soil seed banks, the present study is
   the first to show conclusively that Solidago can form a persistent seed
   bank.}},

Abstract = {{Faecal analyses were conducted of six roan antelope populations in the
   Southern African savanna biome, Faecal samples were collected each month
   over a two year period in the Nylsvley Nature Reserve and during winter
   1995 from five other roan populations. Samples were analysed with the
   NIRS procedure for nitrogen and fibres. The macrominerals Ca, P, K and
   Na were analysed with wet chemical analysis. The seasonal variation in
   faecal nitrogen and fibre, with a higher quality in summer (high protein
   and low fibre) is a reflection of the changing forage quality. Seasonal
   changes in macrominerals were not significant, but differences were
   found between populations residing in different geographical areas.
   Since all populations, other than that of the Nylsvley Nature Reserve,
   were artificially fed during winter, a generally higher faecal quality
   was found in these populations. It appears that artificial feeding
   during winter is advantageous for animals. Faecal analysis can be
   applied as a management tool to indirectly measure the forage quality.
   This study indicated that when monitoring seasonal changes in faecal
   quality or the effectiveness of a winter feeding programme for roan,
   only FN and faecal fibres need be measured. When comparing the diet
   quality between geographical areas, the measurement of macrominerals
   would be more appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{Field populations of green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), were
   collected from five produce fields near Yuma, Arizona. Three of the
   fields sampled contained both red and green-colored forms, while the
   remaining two fields contained only green-colored green peach aphids.
   Red-colored aphids were consistently more resistant to dimethoate and
   lambda-cyhalothrin, and usually more resistant to endosulfan than
   green-colored aphids collected from the same field. Slight differences
   in susceptibility to imidacloprid suggest that development of resistance
   is a possibility and justifies close resistance monitoring.
   Susceptibility to imidacloprid was not influenced by color form. We
   detected little or no differences in susceptibility to acephate,
   mevinphos or bifenthrin.}},

Abstract = {{Population development of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, was
   studied in cotton planted in late April, late May, and late June for
   seven consecutive years, 1988-1994. `Paymaster 145' cotton was grown
   dryland each year at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station at
   Chillicothe, TX. Abiotic factors that were monitored included maximum
   daily temperature, both ambient and under the leaf surface, number of
   days during late July-early August with minimum ambient temperatures
   less than or equal to 20 degrees C, solar radiation, daylength, light
   intensity and wavelength. Biotic variables included percentage leaf
   moisture and nitrogen, square/boll ratios, predators (lady beetles,
   lacewing and syrphid fly larvae), parasites, and the pathogen,
   Neozygites fresenii (Nowakowski). Multiple regression and correlation
   analyses were used to determine the most influential variables affecting
   population development including timing of population increase, average
   and peak numbers of aphids per leaf, timing of peak population numbers,
   and rate of population decline. Suppression of cotton aphid populations
   during June and July, followed by population increase during August, was
   correlated with abiotic factors including high temperatures and solar
   radiation. Rate of population decline was related to biotic factors
   including predator numbers, plant nutrition, and peak aphid density.
   Timing of peak populations in August was related to high temperatures,
   number of nights with low temperatures less than or equal to 20 degrees
   C and to plant nutrition. Average population density during August was
   regulated by abiotic and biotic factors and their interactions; however,
   aphid numbers in the late April and late May plantings were mostly
   influenced by high temperatures while numbers in the late June planting
   were mostly influenced by plant nutrition. Peak numbers of aphids were
   correlated with solar radiation, daylength, and percentage leaf
   nitrogen. The influence of biotic and abiotic factors on population
   regulation is discussed for each planting date and for all planting
   dates combined.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of elevated volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, as
   distinct From pH, on the methanogenic degradation of butyrate and
   valerate were determined. Microbial associations capable of degrading
   butyrate or valerate were enriched from municipal refuse and stabilised
   in multi-stage continuous culture systems. The responses of these
   associations to each of the applied acids (100 mmol l(-1) acetate,
   propionate, or butyrate) indicated that the butyrate-and
   valerate-degrading associations were characterized by different
   populations of acetogenic and sulphate-reducing bacteria, despite being
   enriched from the same refuse source. The sulphate reducing bacteria
   were generally more susceptible to elevated VFA concentrations than the
   methanogens. Propionate promoted methanogenesis in the presence of
   bacteria capable of metabolising this fatty acid, but had an inhibitory
   effect on butyrate oxidation. In most cases, 100 mmol l(-1) acetate
   indirectly inhibited methane production. It was thus recommended that
   leachate concentrations of acetate and propionate should be closely
   monitored, since the onset of methanogenesis in landfill sites may be
   delayed by elevated levels of these volatile fatty acids, rather than
   the concomitant reduction in leachate pH. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The relative genetic similarity of 37 wild oat samples was determined
   using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. These data
   were compared with the herbicide-resistance characteristics of each
   sample to determine the importance of mutation and gene flow in the
   spread of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitor resistance. There
   was a strong association between the genotypic clustering of samples,
   their herbicide-resistance characteristics, and their field of origin.
   Up to eight separate patches in a field were genetically similar,
   confirming that gene flow by seed movement is important in the
   distribution of resistant (R) wild oat seed. A greater emphasis on field
   scouting and treatment of wild oat patches could reduce the spread of
   resistance within fields. Samples collected from different fields were
   also found to be genetically similar, indicating that R wild oat was
   spread between fields. Improved sanitation of tillage and harvesting
   equipment and the use of certified seed could limit such seed movement.}},

   {[}dimethylphosphate (DMP) + dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP) +
   dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP)] (nmol/g creatinine) was 65.3(4.8) and
   419.2(2.1), respectively, for employees engaged in the formulation of a
   product containing 80\% mancozeb (n = 9), 36.6(1.9) and 296.4(2.4) for
   those formulating a product containing 35\% mancozeb (n = 9), 9.5(6.1)
   and 1022.4(3.0) for those engaged in plant maintenance and internal
   transport of materials (n = 6), 10.3(4.2) and 322.8(3.3) for those
   engaged in packaging the mancozeb formulations (n = 16), 4.4(3.3) and

   (n = 11), and 3.0(2.7) and 871.7(3.3) for those bottling the same
   dimethoate formulation (n = 10). Air concentrations (mu g/m(3)) ranged
   from 25.3 to 194.4 for dimethoate, from 0.2 to 1.3 for ETU, and from
   139.9 to 949.0 for mancozeb. Urinary excretion of ETU and
   alkylphosphates showed a significant correlation with mancozeb (r(2) =
   .971), and ETU (r(2) = .858), and dimethoate (r(2) = .955) contamination
   of the hands. Potential dose estimates showed that the potential
   respiratory doses of mancozeb and dimethoate accounted, on the average,
   for 38\% of the total potential dose. The potential respiratory dose of
   ETU was 7\% of the total potential dose. Total estimated absorption did
   not exceed the accepted daily dose (ADI) for ETU and mancozeb, but the
   ADI for dimethoate was exceeded. Serum and erythrocyte cholinesterase
   activities in workers formulating dimethoate products were not
   significantly different before and after exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Fossil remains of lizards on Pacific islands are uncommon. Where known,
   they are a unique source of information for assessing patterns of
   dispersal and extinction. Paleontological and archaeological excavations
   conducted in 1995 on Rota, Aguiguan, and Tinian yielded hundreds of
   bones of 12 species of lizards and one snake from historic and
   prehistoric age strata. The lizards include all six gecko species
   presently known in the Marianas and at least four of the skinks. Five
   species identified from Aguiguan are unknown there today as is another
   from Rota, Bones of an unidentified gekkonid lizard were also recovered
   from the three islands but cannot be referred to any genus presently
   known in Micronesia, The blind snake cf. Ramphotyphlops braminus is
   present in prehistoric and prehuman levels, demonstrating that it is a
   naturally occurring member of the herpetofauna. All of the species that
   are supposedly native in the Marianas occurred in some strata of
   prehistoric age except for Gehyra oceanica and G. mutilata, which were
   restricted to a few historic horizons. The nonnative monitor, Varanus
   indicus, only occurred in two sites of historic age. The most abundantly
   represented species at all sites are the gecko Perochirus ateles and the
   skink Emoia slevini. Both of these species have narrower distributions
   in the Marianas today, and E, slevini apparently achieved a
   substantially larger snout-vent length (to 110 mm) than that of modern
   voucher specimens.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial community-based measurements to detect effects of heavy metals

   The phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition gives an integrated
   picture of all living organisms in the soil, and changes in the PLFA
   pattern of the soil indicate an altered species composition due to, e.g.
   metal toxicity. An increased bacterial community tolerance to metals
   also indicates an altered community composition, with tolerant organisms
   becoming more abundant relative to sensitive organisms. The use of these
   two techniques is described, and their advantages and disadvantages as

Abstract = {{The distributions of host-specific herbivorous insects along latitudinal
   and altitudinal gradients, particularly within arctic and alpine
   environments, provide useful analogs for predicted future changes that
   are likely to occur over time at any one location, given a gradually
   changing thermal environment. It is suggested that selected examples of
   these insect/plant systems can serve as highly responsive sensors of
   changing climatic temperatures. Distributions of insects that show a
   restricted occurrence within the overall range of their host plant are
   predicted to respond more rapidly than the distribution of the host
   plants themselves. Examples are given to show how these insect-plant
   systems might be used to monitor longterm temperature change. These
   examples, drawn from both our published and unpublished work on
   Homoptera (Insecta), include the following common and widely distributed
   host plant species within the Northern Hemisphere: Dryas octopetala,
   Chamerion angustifolium, dwarf Salix species including S. lapponum, and
   Calluna vulgaris/Erica cinerea.}},

Abstract = {{We studied changes in the abundance, population structure, and
   reproductive traits of an endangered rattlesnake Sistrurus catenatus
   between 1979-1983 and 1993-1995. This population was subjected to an
   extensive flood during the summer of 1993, the most severe flood in
   northern Missouri in at least 100 years. The abundance of rattlesnakes
   had not changed substantially since the initial studies in the 1980s,
   but sex ratio, population structure, and body condition differed
   significantly. Most of these changes can be attributed to the 1993
   flood, which severely damaged the habitat for the snakes and may have
   reduced prey availability. Data collected in 1995-1996 suggest that both
   the habitat and the massasauga population are recovering from the 1993
   flood Monitoring programs for endangered species should collect data not
   just on changes in abundance, but changes in underlying population
   characteristics as well. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Site and time effects are important factors determining tray catches of
   tsetse flies. These factors may interact significantly and therefore
   confound interpretation of time series data used for population
   monitoring. We therefore investigated the magnitude and importance of
   site x time interactions in trap catches of Glossina pallidipes Austen
   and G. longipennis Corti using a 2200 trap-days (400 trap-months) data
   set. The interaction was found to be significant (P < 0.05) in 46-100\%
   of the combinations of different numbers of months and sites between 2
   and 12. The mean percent variance due to the interaction ranged between
   4\% and 28\% for G. pallidipes and 12\% and 36\% for G. longipennis. The
   interaction was usually less important than the effect of site alone but
   more important than the effect of time alone. These results suggest that
   tsetse researchers should examine critically the adequacy of existing
   approaches to population monitoring with traps and to testing new traps
   and odour baits.}},

   (L.) Batsch) were monitored using bark washing and direct or impression
   plating techniques and scanning electron microscopy during potential
   Cystospora canker infection periods. Total populations of fungi were
   high in the fall but dropped in the winter and increased during the
   spring. Yeasts and yeast-like fungi predominated in the spring and fall
   samples. The principal yeasts were Basidiomycetes in the form genera
   Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, and Sporobolomyces. The yeast-like fungi were
   Aureobasidium and Taphrina. The principal filamentous fungi were in the
   form genera Altenaria, Epicoccum, Cladosporium, Coniothyrium and
   Libertella, The canker pathogens, Leucostoma persoonii (Nits.) Hohn. and
   Leucostoma cincta (Pers. \& Fr.) Hohn., were observed mainly in the
   spring sampling. Lenticels supported greater fungal populations than
   smooth (non-lenticel) bark surfaces. The impact of fungal epiphytes,

Abstract = {{Following reports of dramatic declines in managed and feral honey bees
   from nearly every region of North America, scientists and resource
   managers from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada come together to review the
   quality of the evidence that honey bees as well as other pollinators are
   in long-term decline and to consider the potential consequences of these
   losses on the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of the
   yield of food crops. These experts in pollination ecology confirmed that
   the last 5 years of losses of honeybee colonies in North America leaves
   us with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the last 50 years
   and that the management and protection of wild pollinators is an issue
   of paramount importance to our food supply system. Although there are
   conclusive data that indicate 1200 wild vertebrate pollination may be at
   risk, data on the status of most invertebrate species that act as
   pollination agents is lacking. The recommendations from a working group
   of over 20 field scientists, presented here, have been endorsed by 14
   conservation and sustainable agriculture organizations, research
   institutes, and professional societies including the Society for
   Conservation Biology. Among the most critical priorities for future
   research and conservation of pollinator species are (1) increased
   attention to invertebrate systematics, monitoring, and reintroduction as
   part of critical habitat management and restoration plans. (2)
   multi-year assessments of the lethal and sublethal effects of
   pesticides, herbicides, and habitat fragmentation on the wild pollinator
   populations in and near croplands; (3) inclusion of the monitoring of
   seed and fruit set and floral visitation rates in endangered plant
   management and recovery plans; (4) inclusion of habitat needs for
   critically-important pollinators in the critical habitat designations
   for endangered plants; (5) identification and protection of floral
   reserves near roost sites along the ``nectar corridors{''} of threatened
   migratory pollinators; and (6) investment in the restoration and
   management of a diversity of pollinators and their habitats adjacent to
   croplands in order to stabilize or improve crop yields The work group
   encourages increased education and training to ensure that both the lay,
   public and resource managers understand that pollination is one of the
   most important ecological services provided to agriculture through the
   responsible management and protection of wildland habitats and their
   populations of pollen-vectoring animals and nectar-producing plants.}},

Abstract = {{Crop loss to wildlife impedes local support for conservation efforts at
   Kibale National Park, Uganda. Systematic monitoring of crop loss to
   wildlife (mammals larger than 3 kg) and livestock was conducted in six
   villages around Kibale over a 2-year period. Five wildlife species
   accounted for 85\% of crop damage events: baboons, bushpigs, redtail
   monkeys, chimpanzees, and elephants. Marked variation in frequency, and
   extent of damage is reported within villages, between villages, and
   between wildlife species. Fields lying within 500 m of the forest
   boundary lost 4-7\% of crops per season on average, but the distribution
   of damage was highly skewed such that maize and cassava fields were on
   occasion completely destroyed. Multivariate analysis was used to test
   predictors of damage, including human population density guarding,
   hunting, sight distance, and distance from the forest. Tests were
   performed at two levels of analysis, field and village. Distance from
   the forest edge explained the greatest amount of variation in crops
   damage, although hunting also influenced the extent of crop damage
   Elephants inflicted catastrophic damage to farms but their forays were
   rare and highly localized. Livestock caused considerable damage to crops
   but farmers seldom complained because they had institutionalized modes
   of restitution. Although most of the crop damage by wildlife is
   restricted To a narrow band of farmers living near the forest edge, risk
   perception among these farmers has been amplified by legal prohibitions
   on killing wild animals Elevating local tolerance for wildlife will
   require diverse approaches, including channeling economic benefits to
   Kibale's neighbors and providing compensation in limited cases.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of agricultural soils were collected across North Carolina in
   1992 and Nebraska in 1993 to determine which indices of nematode
   communities could be applied to distinguish ecological pattern at
   regional geographic scales. Sampling density was proportional to the
   area of agriculture in each region of each state. Maturity indices
   (based on life-history characteristics) were calculated to determine the
   successional status of nematode communities, and diversity indices were
   calculated to estimate relative abundance of nematode trophic groups.
   Population densities of nematode families were also compared between
   states and among regions within states. The range of maturity-index
   values for free-living and plant-parasitic nematodes was greater for
   soils in North Carolina than in Nebraska. The relative distribution of
   nematode trophic groups (bacterial feeders, fungal feeders, plant
   parasites, omnivores, and predators) was similar in the two states.
   Significant differences in maturity-index values for free-living and
   plant-parasitic nematodes were found between but not within states. We
   conclude that regional or national assessments of soil ecological
   condition based on measures of nematode community structure can be made
   at a geographic resolution of 125 000-200 000 km(2) of land area.}},

Abstract = {{1. Thermoregulatory behaviour of the Senegalese grasshopper, Oedaleus
   senegalensis (Krauss), was investigated in the field following a spray
   application of an oil-based formulation of Metarhizium flavoviride Gams
   and Rozsypal in Niger, West Africa.
   2. Measurements of environmental temperature, wind speed and solar
   radiation were made in conjunction with measurements of internal body
   temperatures of grasshoppers from a control (unsprayed) and treated plot
   using microthermocouples and hand-held thermometers. Grasshoppers were
   monitored for 4 days from the third day after application.
   3. Oedaleus senegalensis utilized a range of thermoregulatory behaviours
   to maximize body temperatures during periods of low insolation and
   ambient temperature, and to minimize excessive heat loading during the
   hottest periods. Preferred body temperature of uninfected grasshoppers
   was 39 degrees C, with a range from 24 degrees C in the early morning to
   a high of 46 degrees C during periods of high insolation and ambient
   temperature.
   4. Infected grasshoppers altered their thermoregulatory behaviour and
   showed a behavioural fever response to the pathogen. Preferred body
   temperatures of infected individuals were raised to a new set point of
   approximate to 42 degrees C. This is believed to be the first evidence
   for a behavioural fever in response to a microbial infection for any
   natural population. In the present study, its effects appeared to
   provide little therapeutic advantage to hosts infected following
   application. Preliminary evidence from other studies, however, indicates
   that modifications to host thermoregulation could be a significant
   constraint to the pathogen and may limit its impact under certain
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{An individual-based model of nesting smallmouth bass, Micropterus
   dolomieu, is used to predict the effects of water level fluctuations on
   reproductive success. The model simulates daily nest site selection,
   spawning, nest guarding, and development and survival of eggs, embryos,
   and larvae until dispersal. The model was configured for Brownlee
   Reservoir, Idaho-Oregon. Each reservoir bank is represented as a
   rectangular grid of cells, with each cell characterized by an assigned
   slope, substrate, and elevation, and by a water depth that varied daily.
   Nest site (cell) selection is determined from a habitat suitability
   index (HSI) based on substrate, slope, and depth. Development of young
   is temperature-dependent. Mortality of young occurs via attrition,
   abandonment by the guarding male, and probabilistic whole-nest
   catastrophe. Simulations were performed that used observed data for 1991
   to 1996. Model predicted nest habitat selection and egg-to-dispersal
   survival rates were similar to observed values. Additional model
   simulations showed that: (1) nest habitat selection was best predicted
   when depth, slope, and substrate were considered together rather than
   singly, (2) egg-to-dispersal survival was related to the magnitude of
   water level fluctuations during the peak spawning period, (3) relating
   mortality to HSI values resulted in lower survival, while relating
   growth to HSI values resulted in higher survival, and (4) spawning
   habitat is not limiting in Brownlee Reservoir. Suggestions for future
   monitoring of reservoir-based smallmouth bass populations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There are many reports of variation and changes within parthenogenetic
   lineages of aphids that are not clearly related to environmental
   factors. This suggests that intraclonal as well as interclonal genetic
   variation must be a priori considered when studying the evolution of an
   aphid population. To investigate intraclonal genetic variation in host
   use in the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae F., 3 fines were founded
   by a single female and maintained for 2 yr on either a susceptible wheat
   genotype. Triticum aestivum L. `Arminda', or highly resistant Varieties
   of wheat, T. monococcum L. lines `Tm44' and `Tm16', We examined possible
   changes in the intrinsic rate of natural increase and feeding behavior
   (electronic monitoring) of the 3 isofemale lines on their rearing plant
   over the 2-yr course of the selection Experiment (60-70 successive aphid
   generations). No response to selection for increased survival or
   increased ability to feed on resistant wheat was detected, suggesting
   that S. avenae clones are not genetically variable for these traits.
   These results support the idea, still controversial of a genetic
   stability of parthenogenetic lineages of aphids and show that only the
   interclonal variability must be taken into account when examining the
   evolution of the ability to overcome plant resistance in S. avenae
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersal behavior of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) adults along a
   22-36 degrees C temperature gradient in stored wheat was monitored over
   a 20-h period with 8 microphones. Males tended to disperse more readily
   than females but both preferred temperatures of >30 degrees C. Single
   adults generally did not stay at one location very long, and the average
   time of 9.7 min spent at the warm end with a temperature gradient was
   longer than that of 4.4 min spent at that location without a temperature
   gradient. An adult moved to a location 1, 2, and 3 microphones (7.8,
   15.6, and 23.4 cm) away from where they were previously detected in
   88.2, 10.6, and 1.2\% of the cases. The temperature preference was much
   more evident with groups of 6 adults than with single adults because the
   presence of other adults apparently increased the time that adults spent
   at preferred temperatures. Observations on the times spent at different
   temperatures, the distances mol ed, and the influence of the sex of an
   adult and the presence of other adults provide the information needed to
   develop a predictive model for adult dispersal in response to the
   temperature gradients that occur in stored grain during the autumn and
   spring.}},

Abstract = {{Insect outbreaks are a major disturbance factor in Canadian forests. If
   global warming occurs, the disturbance patterns caused by insects may
   change substantially, especially for those insects whose distributions
   depend largely on climate. In addition, the likelihood of wildfire often
   increases after insect attack, so the unpredictability of future insect
   disturbance patterns adds to the general uncertainty of fire regimes.
   The rates of processes fundamental to energy, nutrient, and
   biogeochemical cycling are also affected by insect disturbance, and
   through these effects, potential changes in disturbance patterns
   indirectly influence biodiversity. A process-level perspective is
   advanced to describe how the major insect outbreak system in Canadian
   forests, that of the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.
   {[}Lepidoptera: Tortricidae]), might react to global warming. The
   resulting scenarios highlight the possible importance of natural
   selection, extreme weather, phenological relationships, complex
   feedbacks, historical conditions, and threshold behavior. That global
   warming already seems to be affecting the lifecycles of some insects
   points to the timeliness of this discussion. Some implications of this
   process-level perspective for managing the effects of global warming on
   biodiversity are discussed. The value of process-level understanding and
   high-resolution, long-term monitoring in attacking such problems is
   emphasized. It is argued that a species-level, preservationist approach
   may have unwanted side-effects, be cost-ineffective, and ecologically
   unsustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Year-to-year fluctuations in the recruitment of the juvenile sea urchin
   Strongylocentrotus nudus were monitored between 1980 and 1995 off the
   coasts of Okushiri Island and Shimamaki on the Sea of Japan coast,
   southwestern Hokkaido. High recruitment levels (14.1 ind./m(2)) of
   juveniles in 1984 and a continuous recruitment after 1990 were observed
   at the survey areas. The relationship between juvenile densities and
   average water temperature in September of the previous year was
   statistically significant. We suggest that high water temperature in
   September contributes to shortening of the larval period. The dominant
   1983 year-class population contributed to an increase in commercial
   catch at the survey areas, and this was also found in the
   sub-prefectures of Shiribeshi and Hiyama.}},

Abstract = {{1. The demography of the vegetable ivory palm Phytelephas seemannii was
   studied on the Pacific coast of Colombia and a female-based matrix model
   was used to determine the proportion of seed that can be sustainably
   harvested from the population.
   2. The density of the palm stands ranged from 240 to 420 adult palms
   ha(-1). The sex ratio was 1:1 and palms of both sexes produced leaves at
   the same rate. Seedlings produced 1.2 leaves per year on average,
   juveniles 1.8, and adults 6.1--7.4.
   3. Adult females had fewer leaves than males (18.5 vs. 21.3 on average).
   Leaves of females lasted about 2.7 years in the crown, those of males
   about 3.2 years.
   4. Stems creep on the ground, growing at the apex and often dying
   behind, the extant portion not always reflecting the palm's total age.
   The longest stem of a female palm in the study plots was 2.5 m,
   corresponding to an `extant' age of 85 years; the longest stem recorded
   was that of a male (outside the plots) 10.5 m In long, corresponding to
   an `extant' age of 184 years. These figures reflect differences in
   growth habit, not in longevity.
   5. Reproduction began at about 24 years, when the palm still lacked an
   above-ground stem.
   6. The population growth rate lambda was 1.059, and was most sensitive
   to changes in survival of juveniles and adults, and relatively
   insensitive to changes in fecundity and growth.
   7. River channel migration is the most important cause of adult
   mortality. Phytelephas seemannii is apparently an efficient colonizer of
   the understorey in the late phases of riverine forest succession.
   8. The population call tolerate a harvest intensity of 86\% of all seeds
   before lambda decreases to the equilibrium level of 1.00. Monitoring of
   the populations under intensive harvesting is required.}},

Abstract = {{Slowing the expansion of the range of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar
   (L.), in North America will reduce the area affected by gypsy moth
   populations in the future and hence may be economically justified. The
   rate of range expansion can be reduced by eradication of isolated gypsy
   moth infestations in a barrier zone that is located just beyond the
   expanding population front and is slowly shifted in the direction of
   population spread. We developed a model to optimize the allocation of
   resources for monitoring and treatment of isolated colonies in a barrier
   zone. Model parameters were estimated using data collected in the
   central Appalachian Mountains. The model predicted that the cost of
   slowing population spread is minimized when the density of pheromone
   traps and eradication activity within the barrier zone decrease with
   increasing distance from the population front. Sensitivity analysis
   indicated that the output was most sensitive to the change of the
   maximum distance from the population front at which colonies can become
   established. The present value of predicted costs of all monitoring and
   treatment in the barrier zone were <1/4 the present value of expected
   benefits from slowing the spread of the gypsy moth over 25 yr.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated responses of adult plum curculios, Conotrachelus nenuphar
   (Herbst), to black unbaited pyramids (111 cm tall) capped by conical
   boil weevil trap tops and placed at various locations on the ground in a
   small commercial apple orchard or in patches of unsprayed apple trees in
   Massachusetts. Pyramid traps adjacent to apple tree trunks captured
   significantly more adults than those between apple trees, those between
   apple trees and an adjacent woods, and those between apple trees and an
   adjacent open field. Also, they captured significantly more adults than
   unbaited conical boil weevil trap tops placed on cut ends of vertical
   twigs or in other positions in apple tree canopies. Further tests
   revealed that the nature of the ground cover (bare soil or short grass)
   beneath or between tree canopies had no detectable effect on captures by
   pyramid traps, whereas captures decreased significantly as traps were
   placed further from the tree trunk. Indirect evidence from additional
   tests with pyramids and direct evidence from observations of released
   adults permitted classification of responses to pyramids according to
   curculio arrival by night or by crawling and according to arrival during
   light or darkness. Together, these provided a possible explanation for
   lack of effect of ground cover but significant effect of trap location
   on captures. Even at the most favored location (next to tree trunks),
   daily captures on pyramid traps failed to correlate positively with
   daily incidence of injury to fruit caused by plum curculio feeding or
   egglaying, suggesting that further research is necessary before unbaited
   pyramid traps can be recommended for use in monitoring plum curculio
   populations in commercial apple orchards in Massachusetts.}},

   larval shore crab, Carcinus maenas}},

Abstract = {{The shore crab, Carcinus maenas L. (Portunidae), is a coastal and
   estuarine species, which can live and reproduce under brackish water
   conditions; freshly hatched larvae have been observed in the field at
   salinities below 15 parts per thousand. In the present laboratory study,
   the tolerance of hypo-osmotic stress was experimentally investigated in
   early larvae of a marine (North Sea) population of C. maenas reared at
   four different salinities (15, 20, 25, 32 parts per thousand). Two and 4
   days after hatching, the Zoea I larvae were moult-staged
   microscopically, and their rates of respiration and growth (changes in
   dry weight, W, carbon, C, nitrogen, N, and hydrogen, H) were measured.
   Survival and development were monitored until the megalopa was reached:
   15 parts per thousand did not allow for development beyond the first
   zoeal stage, while metamorphosis to the megalopa was reached at
   salinities greater than or equal to 20 parts per thousand. At 20 parts
   per thousand, development was significantly delayed and mortality
   enhanced as compared with 25 and 32 parts per thousand. Rates of growth
   and respiration decreased during exposure to reduced salinities less
   than or equal to 25 parts per thousand. Hence, the suppression of growth
   could not be explained as a consequence of enhanced metabolic losses per
   larva. Instead, a partial C budget indicates that the Zoea I larvae
   suffered from decreased capabilities of assimilating ingested and
   subsequently converting assimilated matter to tissue growth. Net growth
   efficiency (K-2, C-based) was at 25 and 32 parts per thousand initially
   high (> 60\% during the postmoult and intermoult stages of the Zoea I
   moult cycle), but decreased during the later stages (down to less than
   or equal to 30\% in premoult). An inverse pattern of C partitioning was
   observed at less than or equal to 20 parts per thousand, with initially
   low K-2 values (less than or equal to 21\% during the first 2 days of
   the moult cycle), and a later increase (up to greater than or equal to
   46\% in premoult). Thus, larval growth was initially suppressed under
   conditions of reduced salinity, but this was later (during premoult)
   partially compensated for by an increase in C assimilation and K-2. Our
   observations indicate that Zoea I shore crab larvae react during the
   late stages of their moulting cycle less sensitively against reduced
   salinities than during postmoult and intermoult. This suggests that the
   transition between moult cycle stages C and D-0 may be a critical point
   for effects of hypo-osmotic stress, similarly as already known in
   relation to effects of nutritional stress. Negative effects were found
   also when freshly hatched Zoea I shore crab larvae were exposed only
   transitorily (for 24-72 h) to 20 parts per thousand, with significantly
   lower rates of survival, development, growth, respiration, and K-2.
   These effects increased with increasing duration of initial exposure to
   reduced salinity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated seasonal variation in home-range area and documented the
   extent of home-range fidelity among seasons for nonjuvenile (greater
   than or equal to 1 year) male and female martens (Martes americana) in a
   forest preserve that was closed to trapping. Indices of home-range area
   were not different between early (1 November-31 December) and late
   winter (1 January-31 March) for either sex (P > 0.52). Further,
   home-range area and indices to home-range area of males and females did
   not differ (P > 0.27) between summer and winter, suggesting that martens
   responded to changing seasonal conditions at scales smaller than the
   home range. The proportion of males maintaining residency throughout the
   period monitored was higher (P = 0.02) than that of females, indicating
   that home ranges of females were more dynamic than home ranges of males
   among seasons. Five resident females abandoned their home-ranges,
   despite two of the females having previously lactated. For martens that
   maintained resident status for consecutive seasons, a median of 71\% of
   radio locations of 37 males and 83\% of radio locations of 14 females
   occurred within the home range of the previous season. Neither males or
   females adjusted the size of their home ranges among seasons; however,
   males tended to shift location of their home ranges in response to
   increases in available space. In contrast to males, females either
   maintained a high degree of fidelity among seasons without shifting
   location of their home range, or completely abandoned previously
   established home ranges. Spacing systems of female martens appear more
   rigid than those of males. Abandonment of existing home ranges by some
   females may result from stresses associated with high density in
   untrapped populations.}},

Abstract = {{A beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and a hygromycin B (hygB)
   phosphotransferase gene were integrated separately into the Trichoderma
   harzianum strain 1295-22 genome, using biolistic transformation. The
   mycelial growth and biocontrol ability of the transformed strains did
   not differ from that of the original strain. The transformed
   Gus(+)-kanamycin-resistant (Gus(+)Kan(R)) strains were used to monitor
   growth and interactions with Rhizoctonia solani on creeping bentgrass
   plants. The hygB-resistant (hygB(R)) strains were used to selectively
   recover strain 1295-22 from the rhizosphere soil and phylloplane of
   creeping bentgrass after spray applications. The population levels of
   two hygB(R) strains and the original strain were very similar for all
   treatments. All three strains persisted for the duration of the
   experiment (28 days) in both the rhizosphere soil and on leaves,
   although population levels declined somewhat over the course of the
   experiment in unautoclaved soils. In this study, the results
   demonstrated that hygB(R) strains remained dominant over time when
   assayed on Trichoderma-selective medium containing hygB. The hygB(R)
   strains were not displaced by strains that colonized untreated plants.
   Microscopic observation showed that the Gus(+)Kan(R) strains colonized
   the rhizoplane, seed coat, and phylloplane of creeping bentgrass. These
   results supported our earlier observation that strain 1295-22 was
   rhizosphere and phylloplane competent. Interactions between T. harzianum
   and R. solani were readily observed in situ and changed over time. Two
   types of reactions were found in these experiments. In the first type,
   sections of hyphae of R. solani near the hyphae of T. harzianum appeared
   damaged, and the pathogen appeared necrotic when viewed with a
   microscope. The second type, observed less frequently than the first
   type, was typical of mycoparasitism, The findings in this study provide
   new insight into the interactions between R. solani and T. harzianum,
   providing a basis for future research.}},

Abstract = {{In the Zhytomyr region, about 52 000 measurements of the I-131 activity
   in thyroids were performed. On the basis of these measurements,
   individual doses have been assessed for the people monitored and
   age-dependent average doses have been estimated for those settlements
   with more than 11 direct measurements. In order to estimate the pattern
   of thyroid exposure in the Zhytomyr region, these doses have been
   interpolated or extrapolated to population groups who were not monitored
   during May-June 1986. For this purpose, a model has been developed based
   on a correlation between thyroid dose estimates with the Cs-137
   deposition and the co-ordinates of the settlements relative to
   Chernobyl. Collective doses of people who were born in the years 1968 to
   1986 were calculated. The radiation-induced thyroid cancer incidence in
   the period 1991 to 1995 was assessed by subtracting the spontaneous
   incidence from the observed incidence. The result is considerably lower
   than that observed in longer periods after external exposures. Possible
   reasons for this difference are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between the weeds Bromus sterilis L., Galium aparine L. and
   Papaver rhoeas L. were investigated over 3 years of continuous winter
   wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) across a factorial combination of organic
   and conventional fertilizer, and ploughing and hand-roguing contrasted
   with minimum tillage and herbicide. The species were sown separately and
   together at 50 seeds m(-2) per species at the start of the experiment in
   October 1989. In addition, there were weed-free and background-weed
   controls. Weed densities were monitored at roughly monthly intervals and
   clop yield recorded for three seasons. B. sterilis populations increased
   10-fold under minimum tillage, but declined under ploughing. Densities
   of P. rhoeas remained largely low. G. aparine increased on the
   organically fertilized minimum-tillage plots, except where B. sterilis
   was present; the high densities of B. sterilis reduced the population
   size of G. aparine. Crop yield was influenced most strongly by the
   fertilizer treatment in the first season, but later the density of B.
   sterilis was by far the most important factor; the evidence of
   interactive effects of the different weed species on crop yield was weak
   at best. Interactive effects of arable weed species can be observed, but
   only at very high densities, and so are unlikely to be of widespread
   economic importance.}},

Abstract = {{Distances between capture and recapture locations of tagged immature
   hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata (Linnaeus) are analyzed for
   four near-shore survey sites at Mona and Monito Islands, Puerto Rico.
   Data were obtained for 87 turtles ranging in size from 20.0 to 56.7 cm
   straight-line carapace length. Net displacements by individual turtles
   averaged 0.45 km (S.D. = 0.66, range 0.00-5.22) for mean inter-capture
   intervals of 465 days (S.D. = 331, range 9-1118). Measured displacements
   were not correlated with turtle size and did not differ significantly
   between survey sites. Movements of three immature turtles fitted with
   sonic tags were monitored by acoustical tracking in reef habitats along
   the southwestern coast of Mona Island. The area utilized by the turtles
   during the 11-16 days of tracking measured 0.07-0.21 km(2). It is
   concluded that immature hawksbill turtles maintain a limited home range
   area and appear resident at the feeding grounds of Mona and Monito
   Islands for periods of at least several years. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A continuous monitoring system has been developed to measure the
   respiratory time activity (RTA) of the oyster Crassostrea gigas
   (Thunberg). This activity was recorded over 24 h using this technique,
   at constant temperatures of 15 and 21 degrees C in the laboratory. At 21
   degrees C, respiratory activity was measured before and after a period
   of starvation, during which spawning occurred. In the field, RTA was
   measured during two successive tidal cycles of a day. The respiratory
   time activity was defined as the percentage of time spent active by the
   oyster relative to the total experimental time. Important individual
   variability was noticed, percentage of time spent active ranged from 0
   (RTA = 0\%) to 100\% (RTA = 100\%). RTA measured on the whole
   experimental population, taking into account active and non-active
   oysters, varied from 52 to 86\% under laboratory conditions and,
   according to the season, from 44 to 82\% in the field. Considering only
   the active oysters (RTA > 0\%) which represented, according to the
   different experiments, from 75 to 100\% of the studied population, RTA
   varied from 55 to 86\% in the laboratory and from 59 to 94\% in the
   field experiments. The influence of RTA on growth predictions is
   discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   growth in the reference experiment, we first took initial values of
   physiological rates from the literature. We then tuned them to simulate
   individual growth of a first subset of mussels from the reference
   experiment. Using the tuned values, we then modeled growth of a second
   subset of mussels to test the parameter values against their growth. We
   then modeled growth of mussels as a function of population density to
   obtain estimates of biomass-density and production-density curves for
   systems like the reference experiment. These curves provided much of the
   information usually required for managing cultured populations. We
   conclude that combining modelling of reference experiments in this way
   with particle transport models may prove useful for assessing optimal
   stocking density in situations where intensive field work programs are
   not possible. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Insect defoliation is a key disturbance in many forested ecosystems.
   Defoliation monitoring is important for both forest managers and
   scientists. We used 3 Landsat TM images to monitor jack pine budworm
   (Choristoneura pinus pinus) defoliation in a 450,000 ha study area in
   northwestern Wisconsin during a recent outbreak (1990-95). The images
   were atmospherically corrected and spectral mixture analysis was
   employed using spectrometer measurements as endmembers. Heavily
   defoliated stands exhibited a 5\% increase in TM4 reflectance. This
   increase was smaller than the pre-outbreak range of jack pine TM4
   reflectance caused by hardwood mixtures (1987: 17-28\%). Hardwood
   content was negatively correlated with budworm populations (r = -0.69)
   and might be useful to predict future population levels. Defoliation
   could be identified using spectral mixture analysis. The green needle
   fraction at the peak of the outbreak was negatively correlated with
   budworm populations (r = -0.94). Spectral mixture analysis allowed
   reliable jack pine budworm defoliation mapping using Landsat TM imagery
   and may be applicable in other forested ecosystems as well.}},

Abstract = {{Intense mining in former GDR, especially for uranium and lignite did
   damage the environment up to a catastrophic extent and did cause hazards
   for the population as well as for the ecology. The total extent of the
   disastrous destroying and pollution of environment became slowly visible
   after opening up the ``wall{''} in 1989. To get an overview of the
   hazards and the dimension of devastation remote sensing techniques mere
   employed. To stop the impact of mining in ecology, human habitat and
   human health, great efforts are done to renaturalize those areas and to
   prevent further pollution. The works in the uranium mining areas is the
   biggest current attempt for rehabilitation of a former mining area in
   the world. For conducting and monitoring the rehabilitation work and its
   success, as well as changes in ecology, remote sensing data products and
   remote sensing services are developed To serve all possible needs in
   terms of repetition rate, information content and ground resolution a
   wide variety of airborne and spaceborne sensors (ERS-1/2 SAR,

Abstract = {{This paper reports the work to build the monitoring information system
   of the farmland of high, middling and low yield. The analysis of the
   farmland of high, middling and low yield in this system used TM data in
   different time as main data sources and used remote sensing data and
   nonremote-sensing data for compound classification. The typical sample
   site is DingXiang County in ShanXi province, north of china. The
   experience shows that the conditions of irrigation, soil salinity and
   morphology, which are used to be compound factors, directly influence
   the cropper yield. Moreover, different ways of classification were
   compared using different region compartmentalized by rank of irrigation,
   salinity and morphology. The precision of result can be to different
   extent increased. Finally, the best method of classification is found
   out by operation after dividing the synthetic region. The monitoring
   result is obtained from comparing the classified images in different
   time the change of the farmland of high, middling and low yield in five
   years can be figuring out. In addition, the paper reports in detail the
   data of the monitoring information system of the farmland of high,
   middling and low yield is of three different scales for province,
   district and county. With this system the remote sensing data can be
   update in time and long-term monitoring the status of farmland can be
   realized.
   Agriculture synthetical exploitation Is an important way to tap the
   latent power of agricultural resource and to raise output value of
   agriculture. It is a characteristic that China has a large population
   and small-cultivated land, population is increasing and cultivated land
   is decreasing. To change this situation, improving the farmland of high,
   middle and low yield has become the focal point of synthetic agriculture
   region exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{In 1996, a monitoring has been carried out on populations of Botrytis
   cinerea isolated from vineyards located in Piedmont (Northern Italy), in
   order to evaluate the presence of strains of the pathogen resistant to
   anilinopyrimidines and phenylpyrroles, two new classes of botryticides.
   Two vineyards where the new fungicides had been experimentally applied
   were included in the monitoring. A number of strains showing a reduced
   sensitivity to anilinopyrimidines was detected: some of them were
   isolated in vineyards not sprayed with this group of fungicides. Only
   one strain showed multiple resistance to anilinopyrimidines,

Abstract = {{We simulated moose (Alces alces) populations held either at or below
   carrying capacity (K) to determine the effect of population density on
   harvest rate and frequency of alleles favoring antler growth under a
   system of selective harvest. A stochastic model of density-dependent
   population growth was created to achieve stable populations at K with no
   hunting. Rates of mortality not associated with hunting were increased
   to simulate predation losses for a population held below K. The
   increased nutrition available to this lower-density population was
   assumed to result in larger age-specific antler size. Each population
   was subjected to a harvest plan that defined legal bulls as those with
   either a spike-fork antler as yearlings (small bulls) or with an antler
   spread of greater than or equal to 50 inches (127 cm) as large bulls.
   Harvest, population composition, and frequency of alleles favorable to
   antler growth were monitored throughout the simulations. For the
   population held at K, the frequency of favorable antler alleles declined
   slightly from that obtained in the population with no hunting. When the
   population was reduced below K, harvest decreased and the proportion of
   small bulls in the harvest increased compared with the population at K.
   In the population below K, the frequency of favorable alleles declined
   steadily, likely to fixation for unfavorable alleles. Ratios of bulls:
   100 cows in the two harvested populations were similar but ratios of
   small:large bulls were changing, with the population at lower density
   exhibiting a higher proportion of small bulls prior to harvest. Under
   the conditions imposed by our model, increases in age-specific antler
   size associated with increased nutrition resulted in greater selection
   against alleles favorable for antler growth under a scenario of
   selective harvest. Changes in density of moose populations and resulting
   effects of nutrition on the potential for antler growth must be
   considered when predicting the outcome of antler-based selective
   harvests.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to establish whether acid water affects
   the behaviour and physiology of the wintering common frog. Frogs were
   caught from two biotopes ({''}neutral{''} and ``low-pH{''} populations).
   Initially frogs were kept in containers in water with different pH where
   they could chose whether to be in or out of water. Then altogether 210
   frogs were over-wintered at different pH and after winter the liver and
   muscle glycogen contents were determined from 106 frogs. In the
   biomonitoring experiments we tested If changes in water pH had had an
   effect on the total activity of wintering frogs. The same monitoring
   apparatus was also used to measure the heart rates of the frogs at pH 4
   and pH 6.5. Following metamorphosis the common frog is very well adapted
   to cope with environmental acidity. It does not avoid water at pH 4 and
   wintering success occurs also in acid environment. In fact it is a
   matter of concern that mature frogs react so slightly to water acidity
   and therefore they obviously do not avoid acid habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of three populations of greater lotus (Lotus uliginosus
   Schkuhr syn. L. pedunculatus Cav.) was compared at photoperiods of 10,
   12 and 14 h at a maximum day/minimum night temperature of 21/16 degrees
   C and at maximum day/minimum night temperatures of 27/22, 21/16, 18/13
   and 15/10 degrees C at a photoperiod of 12 h. Short days (10 h) favoured
   root and rhizome development compared to long days (14 h). A temperature
   regime of 15/10 degrees C restricted rhizome development compared to the
   18/13 and 21/16 degrees C regimes. Shoot growth was restricted at the
   highest temperature regime (27/22 degrees C). The cultivar Sharnae had
   fewer, but heavier, rhizomes than Grasslands Maku; this may indicate
   adaptation to the dry summers at its site of origin (Algarve, Portugal).
   The response of rhizome growth to temperature and photoperiod explains
   part of the performance of greater lotus in the field at a wide range of
   latitudes. Grazing management to encourage the persistence of L.
   uliginosus in pasture in temperate environments may include the
   exclusion of grazing livestock in autumn. In the sub-tropics, monitoring
   of rhizome production in the field would be required before deciding the
   appropriate time interval between grazing. (C) 1998 Annals of Botany

Abstract = {{Two orchards that contained mainly citrus and a few other hosts were
   monitored during 1991-1993 for Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) on the
   Mediterranean island of Chios, eastern central Greece. The orchards are
   located approximate to 0.5 km apart in a citrus producing plain and
   differ mainly in their numbers and relative abundance of apricots, sweet
   oranges, and bitter oranges. Overall, captures in Jackson traps baited
   with trimedlure were low in Tune and most of July an d also in December
   and January, high from August through November, and absent from February
   through hay. Early in the season, adult abundance was closely associated
   with the presence of ripe apricots, Prunus armeniaca L., and Litter
   oranges, Citrus aurantium L., whereas later with the presence of sweet
   oranges `Valencia', C. cinensis Osbeck, and also figs, Ficus carica L.,
   which are scattered in the area. Despite the close proximity of the 2
   orchards and the bridge of hosts between them, captures started each
   year approximate to 1 mo earlier (mid-June) and the total captures were
   higher in the one orchard that contained apricots and several bitter
   oranges than in the other orchard containing a few bitter oranges. The
   presence of ripe Litter oranges in the former orchard kept flies from
   infesting sweet oranges, which were also susceptible. These results
   suggest that host plant composition and availability and especially the
   presence of highly preferred hosts create a large amount of local
   variation in C. capitata abundance. Implications of our findings are
   discussed with respect to the efficiency of the currently used trapping
   systems for the early detection of C. capitata and the importance of
   sampling fruits from preferred hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Insect and mite pests cause serious damage to the hazelnut crop
   worldwide. The control strategies used against these pests include
   application of insecticides, classical and augmentative biological
   control, utilization of resistant varieties, and use of Bacillus
   thuringiensis-based preparations. In the United States, extensive
   research has been directed toward elucidating ecological interactions
   among different pests and natural enemies and understanding the role of
   abiotic factors in pest population dynamics. Differences exist worldwide
   regarding the understanding of pests and natural enemy biologies and, to
   a limited extent, control practices. An integrated pest management
   approach based on utilizing effective sampling and monitoring techniques
   and a near complete reliance on biological control and ``soft{''}
   pesticides, including insect growth regulators, is currently under
   development both in North America and Europe/Turkey. Hazelnuts are on
   the verge of becoming one of the first crops in the United States that
   could possibly be produced commercially without the use of any
   broad-spectrum organic insecticides.}},

Abstract = {{1. The macroinvertebrate fauna of three restored and two reference
   sections in the River Esrom was compared 4 years after completion of a
   restoration project using gravel, boulders and stream concentrators on a
   3.2-km reach in order to enhance the physical structure and natural
   trout spawning.
   2. Sampling was performed by standard methods (stone-, core-and
   kick-sampling). The faunal communities were compared by Bray-Curtis
   similarity, diversity (H), saprobic index (SI) and Danish fauna index
   (DFI) methods.
   3. Restoration with stream concentrators resulted in a deeper and
   narrower stream with a higher flow velocity near the bottom and a
   coarser substrate compared with the reference section. The fauna showed
   higher similarity to the fauna found on the stony bottom sections due to
   immigration of taxa preferring stony substrate (e.g. Lepidostoma hirtum,
   Theodoxus fluviatilis) and SI and DFI generally improved from II
   to/towards I-II. Clean-water species such as Agapetus ochripes and
   Limnius volckmari, were found in significantly higher numbers in the
   restored sections compared with the reference section.
   4. Five times as many trout spawning redds occurred in the restored
   sections than in the non-restored. However, electro-fishing revealed few
   young-of-the-year trout and did not reflect spawning success.
   5. It was concluded that attempts to improve the physical structure and
   spawning environment altered invertebrate composition, but did not
   enhance trout production. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{1. The Rye Water is the major salmon spawning tributary of the River
   Liffey. It is an example of a lowland river which lost much of its
   productivity as a salmonid river following an arterial drainage scheme
   which extended over 2 years (1955-1957). The scheme introduced a series
   of hydraulically uniform continuous glides of abnormal length and a
   reduction in the diversity of the natural riverine habitats. To rectify
   this, a fisheries enhancement programme was initiated in 1994 on a 2.4
   km stretch of the river.
   2. The aims of the programme were to optimize the capacity of the
   channel to function as a brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) fishery, to
   improve the angling value of the river and to ensure that its role as a
   salmonid spawning and nursery area would be enhanced.
   3. The enhancement project was designed to narrow and deepen the
   channel, create meanders, pools, cover, and to stabilize eroding stream
   banks. Habitat improvement structures included deflectors, riprap and
   boulder placements. Work was carried out by the Office of Public works
   in conjunction with the Central Fisheries Board and the Zoology
   Department, University College Dublin, Ireland.
   4. Detailed monitoring of physical characteristics is continuing.
   Salmonid populations have been monitored by electrofishing before and
   after enhancement at control (unaltered areas) and experimental
   sections. Initial results (i.e. 1 year post-works) indicate that salmon
   densities have significantly increased. Brown trout, on the other hand,
   were slower to recover. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The use of an as-yet-undescribed euryhaline Corophium sp. amphipod as a
   sediment toxicity testing organism was assessed. The species was found
   to be ubiquitous in many tidal areas of the Hawkesbury River catchment.
   The salinity of habitat sites ranged from 0.1 to 24 ppt, sediment total
   organic carbon (TOC) ranged from 0.4\% to 3.5\%, and the fines content
   (< 63 mu m particle size) of the sediment ranged from 4.3\% to 47.6\%,
   Monitored populations ranged from a density of 59 to 6622 individuals
   per m(2), with freshwater sites with a sediment fines content greater
   than 20\% having the highest population densities. The sensitivity of
   the Corophium sp, was assessed by using copper chloride and ammonium
   chloride as reference toxicants in a 96-h static water-only test and a
   10-day static sediment test. The LC50 for copper in freshwater-only
   exposures was 80 to 86 mu g/L, using adult animals collected from the
   field, In contrast, the LC50 for copper in freshwater sediment and the
   sediment pore water were 840 mg/kg (dry weight) and 99 mu g/L,
   respectively. The LC50 for ammonia (total) in freshwater-only at FH 7
   was 5.5 mg/L. In contrast, the LC50 for ammonia (total) in freshwater
   sediment and the sediment pore water were 110 mg/kg (dry weight) and 6
   mg/L, respectively. Laboratory cultures of 5 parts per thousand to 15
   parts per thousand salinity were optimal for supporting the release of
   juveniles. Juveniles collected from laboratory cultures had a LC50 for
   copper in 5 parts per thousand and 10 parts per thousand salinity of 9
   mu g/L and 28.5 mu g/L, respectively, in water-only exposures. The
   juveniles would he suitable for use in the development of a chronic
   sediment toxicity test with growth as the endpoint.}},

Abstract = {{The resistance to deltamethrin was evaluated in diapausing larvae of 14
   field populations of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) from the main
   French orchard areas using biological assays. Resistance to deltamethrin
   was compared to mixed-function-oxidase (mfo) activity measured at the
   individual level through ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECOD) activity
   using a fluorescence microplate reader. The larvae were collected in
   corrugated paper band traps in the autumn of 1995, Analysis was
   previously performed on two laboratory strains, one susceptible and one
   resistant to deltamethrin, in order to characterize the changes in
   resistance during diapause development, Resistance to deltamethrin as
   well as the ECOD activity were stable during the diapause, and ECOD
   activity was always significantly lower in the susceptible strain than
   in the resistant one. The ECOD activity was significantly correlated to
   the frequency of resistant moths in the field populations, This strongly
   suggested the involvement of the mfo system in the resistance to
   deltamethrin in these populations;Tbe intrastrain variabilities in ECOD
   activity of both laboratory and field resistant insects indicated that
   other resistance mechanisms might also be involved, Further
   investigations on these mechanisms are needed in order to develop
   complete diagnostic methods and to define suitable control strategies
   against each resistant population. Arch. Insect Biochem, Physiol,

Abstract = {{To maintain forest biodiversity, and if necessary to restore it,
   quantitative goals should be specified for all properties of a given
   landscape or region. Here an idea is presented on how biodiversity can
   be assessed in the boreal forest, which has a short history of
   transformation compared with other European forest types, and how
   quantitative nature conservation goals can be formulated in different
   geographical scales. Step 1 is to develop a book-keeping system for
   biodiversity. The starting point is the identification of the different
   disturbance regimes found in a natural boreal forest landscape. The
   links between site type and disturbance regime are critical because they
   shape the composition and structure of the forests, as well as many
   important processes, to which forest species have adapted. Step 2 is the
   development of practical methods to measure biodiversity in a landscape.
   The first task is to define the different ecological properties that can
   be found in a naturally dynamic boreal forest landscape as well as to
   identify species that are unique to each property. If it is possible to
   translate the species' habitat requirements into criteria based on their
   environmental demands, these criteria can be used as opposed to the more
   costly inventories of certain indicator species in the field. It is
   important that any system and methods are validated in areas with
   original biodiversity. In step 3, when sufficient knowledge is available
   on how the amount of each property affects the viability of its
   indicator specie's populations, strategic and operative goals can be
   formulated for each property representing the composition and structure,
   in different geographical scales, of naturally dynamic boreal
   landscapes. To implement this logic in practical management will
   alleviate the introduction of proactive management as well as monitoring
   of whether or not quantifiable criteria and indicator species change in
   the desired direction. The practical implementation is beyond the sphere
   of research but must be considered when developing methods to assess
   forest biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Distribution, disturbance tolerance and conservation of Stackhousia
   gunnii in Tasmania}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Abstract = {{Although being possibly widespread on the mainland of Australia, where
   it is recognised as part of the Stackhousia monogyna Labill. complex, S.
   gunnii Hook.f. is an endangered species in Tasmania, with only 10 known
   extant populations, all in the drier parts of the southern Midlands.
   These populations occur largely on roadsides or lightly grazed paddocks
   in vegetation that was originally either Themeda triandra grassland or
   Eucalyptus pauciflora woodland. An ordination of floristic data from
   sites with and without S. gunnii showed that the species occupies a
   floristically distinct environment. The floristic differences between
   stands of S. gunnii relate partly to the presence or absence of tree
   cover and substantially to precipitation. The groups of species that
   preferentially occur with S. gunnii are geophytes, non-geophytic herbs
   and exotic plants, while those that are concentrated elsewhere include
   shrubs, grasses and non-geophytic graminoids. Permanent transects were
   monitored over a 4-year period at seven sites with varying grazing,
   firing and disturbance. The number of shoots varied markedly between
   years in all sites, but not synchronously, even when transects were in
   close proximity. Although shoot numbers increased after fires occurred
   on several ungrazed transect lines, they decreased on one grazed line.
   Deep mechanical disturbance of one site resulted in a dramatic decrease
   in shoot numbers in the following year. However, they increased steadily
   over the following 2 years. Shoot emergence occurred at twice the
   expected rate on bare ground in all years and at all sites, and a
   substantial proportion of shoots was confined to this type of surface.
   However, shoots were also recorded in fewer numbers in grass cover, herb
   cover and non-vascular plant crusts. Like some other threatened plants
   of grassy ecosystems, S. gunnii seems to be rare because it cannot
   survive with heavy grazing disturbance, ploughing and fertilisation,
   and, at the other extreme, because it is susceptible to elimination in
   the absence of environmental conditions and disturbances that create
   bare ground.}},

Abstract = {{Eucalyptus risdonii Hook.f. is believed to be a juvenilised form of its
   sister species, E. tenuiramis Miq., differing largely in the retention
   of the juvenile leaf type at reproductive maturity. The genetic basis of
   this ontogenetic variation was examined by monitoring reproductive and
   vegetative phase changes in 1201 open-pollinated progeny from 40 E.
   risdonii-E. tenuiramis populations in a field trial over 6 years.
   Vegetative and reproductive phase changes were highly heritable and
   genetically independent within populations. Estimates of individual
   narrow-sense heritabilities fur height and timing of vegetative phase
   change ranged from 0.46-0.67 and 0.19-0.23 respectively, and for time of
   first flowering from 0.31-0.41. Variation in the height of vegetative
   phase change amongst progeny grown in a common environment was very
   similar to that observed in the natural populations from different
   environments, demonstrating a genetic basis to a stepped dine in the
   retention of the juvenile leaf form (neoteny). However, a separate
   pattern of variability in the time to flowering was evident, with
   precocious flowering found in a number of phenetic groups. This
   independent variation of reproductive and vegetative phase changes may
   allow dramatic heterochronic alterations in morphology and physiology
   with minimal genetic change. The continuous nature of the neotenic
   variation suggests that speciation by this mode of evolution is not yet
   complete in the E. risdonii-E. tenuiramis complex, but has presumably
   operated to produce many other neotenous eucalypt species.}},

Abstract = {{The response of Trichogramma spp. egg parasitoids to colored sticky
   traps was evaluated in the field during two seasons (1995/1996,
   1996/1997). Traps consisted of a glass tube coated with
   Bird-Tanglefoot(R) into which colored paper was inserted or clear traps
   without paper. Colors tested were white, green, blue, yellow and red in
   the first season and white, green, yellow and black in the second
   season. The proportion of both female and male parasitoids caught on the
   sticky traps was significantly different among colors, indicating that
   the parasitoids actively move between plants and are not solely carried
   along passively by wind. White was the color most preferred by female
   parasitoids, followed by clear and green traps. Yellow was preferred
   over black but was less attractive than green. Visual cues may be used
   by Trichogramma spp. during the habitat location process. The color
   preference of male Trichogramma spp. differed significantly from females
   with yellow and green being more attractive than white. For all colors,
   more female Trichogramma spp. were caught on the sticky traps (>85\% of
   all wasps caught), indicating a lower activity level and/or shorter
   lifespan for males. The use of white cylindrical sticky traps for
   monitoring Trichogramma spp. populations in the field is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies to assess the impact of Bacillus thuringiensis var,
   tenebrionis (Btt)-insecticides on Colorado potato beetle populations,
   egg survivorship and levels of predation on egg masses were conducted in
   replicated field research plots during two years. Stage-specific
   abundance of the Colorado potato beetle and predation on egg masses were
   monitored in Btt-treated and untreated potato plots in both years. The
   Btt-treatments significantly reduced densities of large (third and
   fourth instar) Colorado potato beetle larvae. The densities of large
   larvae remained below 0.5 and 3 per plant in the Btt-treatment while
   peak densities of 4.5 and 21 large larvae per plant occurred in the
   untreated control in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Regular sampling of
   egg masses indicated that predation rates in Btt-treated and untreated
   plots did not differ significantly although, in 1993, predation rates of
   up to 100\% were recorded, only in Btt-treated plots. In a predator
   exclusion study carried out in 1992, survivorship of protected eggs was
   consistently higher than of eggs exposed to predation. Seasonal
   survivorship of exposed eggs was significantly lower in the Btt-treated
   than in untreated plots. Btt insecticides for control of Colorado potato
   beetles provided direct protection of the crop and were compatible with
   naturally-occurring biological control of Colorado potato beetle eggs
   due to predation.}},

Abstract = {{Maize (Zea mays) was cultivated on lead-adultrated soil up to 600 mg(Pb)
   kg(-1). At maturity, the maize seeds were harvested. The glutamate
   dehydrogenase (GDH) was fractionated to its isoenzyme population by
   Rotofor isoelectric focusing (IEF). The increasing Pb concentration
   progressively enhanced the more acidic isoenzymes (pI 6.3 - 6.5), and at
   the same time suppressed the less acidic isoenzymes (pI 7.3 - 7.8) and
   at the 600 mg(Pb) kg(-1)(soil) only the most acidic couple of isoenzymes
   (pi 6.3, and 6.5) were detectable. The NH(4)(+) Km values of the GDH
   increased progressively from 6.2 in the control to 100 mM and the total
   glutathione content of maize seeds from 60 to 240 nmol g(-1) in the 600
   mg(Pb) kg(-1)(soil) treated maize. The orderly, and sequential
   isomerization of GDH in response to Pb suggests that the enzyme
   functions as a sensor in the monitoring of environmentally induced

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{91-118}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We examined population trends and status in 37 taxa of Canadian raptors
   using Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data (1966-1994 and 1985-1994) for the
   whole of Canada and seven ecozones separately, continent-wide Christmas
   Bird Counts (CBC) (1959-1988), migration counts from 12 hawkwatches
   (various dates) and specific research projects. According to the primary
   sources reviewed, many raptor populations increased since the early
   1970s, coinciding with reductions in use of organochlorine pesticides
   (OCs). Species that increased included osprey Pandion haliaetus, bald
   eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus (BBS and CBC) and peregrine falcon Falco
   peregrinus anatum (1995 peregrine falcon survey). Red-tailed hawk Buteo
   jamaicensis, American kestrel Falco sparverius and merlin Falco
   columbarius also generally increased or were stable, but results
   differed according to source, time period and ecozone (both red-tailed
   hawk and American kestrel showed short-term decreases in the Mixedwood
   Plains BBS). Significant declines were found for burrowing owl Speotyto
   cunicularia (BBS), short-eared owl Asio flammeus and long-eared owl Asio
   otus populations (BBS and CBC). Golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos may be
   declining in some areas (CBC, four migration counts) but results were
   equivocal; there was some evidence to suggest that broad-winged hawk
   Buteo platypterus may also be declining. Long-term BBS data indicated
   that Swainson's hawk Buteo swainsoni populations were stable, but
   significant short-term declines were found in the Prairies ecozone,
   corresponding with decreases in productivity measured in long-term
   breeding studies. Sharp-shinned hawk Accipiter striatus apparently
   increased in number according to the overall long-term BBS, but may be
   declining according to some eastern migration count data. While no
   evidence of declines was found for prairie falcon Falco mexicanus, the
   Canadian population is small and vulnerable to habitat change that could
   reduce prey populations. Four species that reach their greatest
   abundance in, or are restricted to, the Prairies and Boreal Plains
   ecozones are declining there (northern harrier Circus cyaneus,
   Swainson's hawk, burrowing owl and short-eared owl). Although causal
   factors vary, our analysis suggests the possibility that large-scale
   phenomena such as human activity (pesticide use or habitat modification)
   and perhaps climate are affecting populations of some Prairie raptors.
   Research on endangered species is being conducted under the auspices of
   national recovery plans. We recommend that research be instigated to
   examine critically productivity failures in Swainson's hawks, and
   possible declines in golden eagle breeding populations. In view, of the
   increasingly wide-spread impact of forestry on northern forests in
   Canada, we further recommend that special surveys be set lip, and
   breeding densities, productivity and occupancy rates be determined in
   different forest types for accipiters, broad-winged hawk, as well as
   forest owls (particularly barren owl Strix varia, boreal owl Aegolius
   funereus and northern saw-whet owl Aegolius acadicus brooksi). We
   caution that the BBS and other national surveys may be inadequate for
   monitoring populations of many raptor species in Canada, particularly
   forest-dwelling accipiters, some owls and buteos. Special monitoring or
   sampling programs are needed for these species. However, taken together,
   multiple sources can provide inferential evidence for population trends
   and status. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The world's oceans have been widely regarded as the source of
   inexhaustible abundance and the need to conserve the Earth's largest
   biotic realm has only recently been recognised. Consequently, studies of
   marine conservation have lagged behind comparable studies of terrestrial
   biomes. Compiling inventories, monitoring ecological communities,
   detecting and monitoring rare and threatened species, devising
   biogeographic classification schemes, declaring protected areas
   (reserves) and reporting to government on the state of the environment
   are strategies thought effective for the conservation of biodiversity.
   There is no comprehensive inventory of Australian marine macroalgae,
   although `The Australian Marine Algal Name Index' stores data on species
   names and species distribution patterns for the continent. No Australian
   marine macroalgal species is currently included on any `Rare and
   Threatened' species list, but this reflects only our inability to detect
   these species. Biogeographic classification schemes have been devised
   for Australian coastal waters, but little is known of the macroalgae in
   many of the bio-regions identified. Many marine protected areas (MPAs)
   have been declared in Australia, but the macroalgae protected in the
   reserves are generally poorly known and the effects of protection on
   macroalgal biodiversity has not been evaluated. Furthermore, many MPAs
   are zoned as multi-use areas, and the actual areas of MPAs zoned as
   `conservation zone', offering strict protection, are very small. The
   greatest impediment to developing effective strategies for the
   conservation of Australian marine macroalgae is the lack of detailed
   knowledge on taxonomy, population size, life history characteristics,
   habitat specificity and geographic distribution of species and on the
   structure and function of macroalgal communities. In order to gain this
   knowledge, priority should be given to research programs directly
   relevant to the inventorying, monitoring, protection and management of
   marine macroalgal biodiversity. It is essential that conservation and
   management of the marine environment are based on scientific knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Ophrys sphegodes is a rare species in the United Kingdom. The largest
   extant population of the species, at Castle Hill National Nature Reserve
   in Sussex, has been monitored each year since 1975. At each annual
   census, which is conducted during the peak period of flowering (May),
   the co-ordinates of each plant are recorded, allowing the fate of
   individuals to be followed from one census to the next. In the present
   study the population was monitored throughout one complete year. The
   data collected allow the phenology of the species to be described and
   the effectiveness of the annual census to be assessed. The study shows
   that a substantial number of Ophrys sphegodes plants emerge above ground
   and re-enter the below ground phase before the census date. These
   results suggest that reliance on annual census records alone may result
   in the size of the population being underestimated and incorrect
   life-histories being ascribed to individual plants. True counts of the
   population may be obtained only if `dormant' plants are retrospectively
   added to the population. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Coeloglossum viride (L.) Hartm. has a worldwide distribution in the
   Northern hemisphere where it can be found in a broad range of habitats;
   it is not, at present, threatened with extinction. Hoc-ever, in several
   European countries there has been a dramatic decline in sites occupied
   by this orchid. In The Netherlands only 2 populations remain of 55
   extant before 1950. Knowledge of its ecology and life history are
   necessary to presence this species at sites not directly threatened by
   habitat destruction. The results of a 7 rear demographic study of a
   population of C. viride in The Netherlands are presented. Annual
   recruitment and mortality vary considerably from year to year: whereas
   the flux in individual plants is always high. The half-life of the
   cohorts varies from 1.0 to 2.4 years and is on average c. 1.5 years.
   This indicates that C. viride is a short-lived terrestrial orchid
   species. The number of flowers per inflorescence varies from 2 to 26 per
   spike. The mean flowering percentage in the population is rather high
   (50\%), while the fruit production was low in the year this was recorded
   (1994), nt. c. 10\% The average number of seeds per capsule was c. 2300.
   Plants emerging above ground for the first time are already able to
   produce an inflorescence, and the average number of flowers equals those
   of plants initially passing a vegetative life phase for one or more
   years. Dormancy is a rare phenomenon in this species and the absence
   above ground when It does occur does not last longer than one growing
   season. Vegetative multiplication plays a minor role in population
   dynamics. The studied population is Likely to be in a healthy state:
   there is a high recruitment almost every year resulting in a vigorous
   age structure. Management of the site, with mowing in July following
   seed dispersal and sheep grazing in winter is beneficial. The absence of
   intentional fertilization is a condition for a suitable, low
   vegetational structure of the sward during die growing season of this
   species. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{In Britain, where it reaches the north-westerly limit of its European
   distribution, Orchis militaris L. is extremely rare. Well-established
   and persistent populations of O. militaris are known to exist at only
   two sites. The largest extant population of O. militaris occurs in a
   disused chalk pit in Suffolk. A preliminary demographic analysis of this
   population, covering the period 1975 to 1991, along with estimates of
   key life stage transition probabilities are presented here. From 1975 to
   1986 the number of separate identifiable plants in the population
   declined substantially. Until 1986 recruitment of rosettes was poor. The
   largest cohort of new plants, recorded in 1976, was 35. Approximately
   48\% of new individuals recruited between 1976 and 1985 failed to
   flower. Of those flowering, approximately 55\% flowered during their
   first year above ground. Of the original population recorded in 1975,
   67.8\% flowered at least once during the study. The reproductive
   performance, i.e. the frequency of flowering and the period between
   episodes of flowering, varied considerably between individuals. Some
   plants flowered every year while others only flowered once during the
   study. Few plants remained below ground for more than one year, while
   several apparently persisted below ground for more than 6 successive
   years. Although the number of plants that can be identified as separate
   individuals has declined, the total number of rosettes in the population
   has, from 1986, increased dramatically. Because of the dense clumping of
   these recruits it is not possible to determine whether they are derived
   from seed or vegetative propagation. When post 1986 recruitment is
   combined with the number of plants that established before 1986 and
   survive, the apparent number of plants present at the site has more than
   doubled between 1975 and 1991. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{A population of Himantoglossum hircinum (L.) Spreng. (lizard orchid) has
   been monitored since the 1940s at a site in the south-east of Great
   Britain. A map of the site showing the number and position of flowering
   plants has been produced in most summers between 1978 and 1994. The maps
   have been digitized on a 25 x 25 m scale. In the summer of 1995 the
   whole site was sun eyed for habitat suitable for the growth of the
   orchid and this information was also digitized on to the 25 m grid. The
   spread of H. hircinum around the site can now be demonstrated with a
   program, SCATTER. Population biology parameters for SCATTER have been
   calculated from data from two permanent 10x10m plots. These data were
   collected annually between 1987 and 1994, and give information on the
   size and position of all H. hircinum plants within the plots. Two
   dispersal models were employed and compared with SCATTER. The first was
   a diffusion model and the second a tilted plume model. The tilted plume
   model describes the expansion of the population of H. hircinum and also
   the number of flowering plants in the population more satisfactorily
   than the diffusion model. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{The Sainsbury Orchid Conservation Project (SOCP), based in the
   Micropropagation Unit of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has worked for
   many years with English Nature, and the Species Recovery Programme in
   particular, in raising plants of the lady's slipper orchid for
   re-establishment. This is a collaborative venture with the involvement
   of a large number of organizations and individuals at national and local
   level. Cypripedium calceolus is one of Britain's rarest plants. Thought
   at one time to be extinct, its decline is due to overcollection by
   botanists for herbarium specimens and by gardeners and it is found now
   on a single, fragile, natural site. It has been wardened since 1970s
   because of concerns about long-term safety and is protected under
   Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Natural pollination
   has not been observed and hand pollination is carried out to ensure seed
   set. Some seed is scattered on site resulting in a few seedlings and the
   remaining capsules are sent to the Sainsbury Orchid Conservation
   Project. In addition, some plants of native origin are held in
   cultivation and molecular techniques are being carried out at kew to
   ascertain how these are related. The best pollination strategy to
   increase genetic diversity is coordinated by English Nature and SOCP, as
   is the optimum collection time post-pollination to achieve maximum
   germination. Seedlings are propagated in the laboratory using immature
   green capsules sown on a range of nutrient media. No symbiotic fungus
   has yet been found for this species. Germination occurs after 6 weeks in
   the dark and the plants chilled when roots are well developed and shoots
   beginning to form. Plants potted up at Kew and near the native site have
   produced leaves and buds and extensive planting trials have now
   commenced. The main objective is to increase the number of localities
   where Cypripedium occurs through re-establishment. As its decline is due
   to overcollection rather than habitat loss, many old sites have changed
   very little. Observation of continental populations is important in
   assessing suitability of potential sites as the extant clone may not be
   in optimum conditions. An initial planting trial on the wild site in
   winter 1989/90 resulted in a 75\% survival rate of seedlings planted
   out. However, establishing seedlings is a long process and careful
   monitoring is required. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{The technology necessary for monitoring and forecasting civilian needs
   in the coastal environments of the world is now available and the design
   of a completely general, multipurpose monitor/forecast system for the
   coastal zone is a valid objective for the next decade. Proper management
   and maintenance of the waters of the coastal zone is essential to the
   health of the economy of coastal nations and states. Recreation,
   fishing, shipping, oil and mineral extraction, and military use each
   represent multibillion dollar industries to the United States, providing
   many thousands of jobs as well as attracting millions of visitors and
   billions of dollars in investments and expenditures. Protection of this
   vital asset will not only protect the existing industries,
   infrastructure and economy, but will also contribute to the
   establishment and growth of new industries, jobs, and to the
   revitalization of coastal economies.
   The continual growth in world economies and population will place
   additional stresses on the coastal environment. High production farming
   and urban runoff from rapidly growing cities with aging infrastructure
   are releasing large amounts of particle effluents into the nearshore
   that combine with;ocean disposal of treated sewage. These practices add
   further stress on the nearshore oceans as population increases.
   Recently, the National. Research Council has identified the following
   issues (in approximate order of descending importance) as posing
   significant threats to the integrity of the Stale of California and the
   U. S. coastal ecosystems: (1) eutrophication; (2) habitat modification;
   (3) hydrologic and hydrodynamic disruption; (4) exploitation of
   resources; (5) toxic effects; (6) introduction of non-indigenous
   species; (7) global climate change and variability; (8) shoreline
   erosion and hazardous storms; and, (9) pathogens and toxins affecting
   human health. Problems associated with changes in the quantity and
   quality of inputs to coastal environments from runoff and atmospheric
   deposition are particularly important. A conceptual system architecture
   is outlined to address the need for continual monitoring and forecasting
   of these problems based upon existing sensor and modeling capabilities.}},

   has proposed a three-part ocean monitoring strategy incorporating: (1)
   temporal and spatial trend studies (including point-source compliance);

   the regulated community recognizes the regional and long term nature of
   potential impacts of a growing human population to the watershed-coastal
   zone relationship. Designed to answer both specific permit requirements
   and questions that the public perceives as important, this approach to
   water quality and living resources monitoring and evaluation (e.g.,
   impaired runoff impacts and losses of habitats) integrates coastal

Abstract = {{Demersal fishes and megabenthic invertebrates are the most
   characteristic larger organisms of the soft-bottom habitat, the most
   extensive habitat of the mainland shelf of Southern California.
   Populations of these organisms have been extensively monitored during
   the past 25 years to assess impacts resulting from wastewater discharge
   on the shelf. Although much is known about their condition in local
   areas, less is known about their spatial variability throughout Southern
   California. This study briefly describes some results of a regional
   survey of demersal fish and invertebrate populations on the mainland
   shelf of Southern California in summer 1994 and discusses variability in
   these populations in the context of previous studies. Spatially, these
   populations vary more consistently by depth than by region or outfall
   area. In particular, the inner shelf (< 25 m in depth) is generally much
   lower in abundance, biomass, and numbers of species than are deeper
   zones on the shelf. Outfall monitoring areas had enhanced populations
   although areas immediately near some outfalls may have depressed
   populations. Changes in demersal fish and invertebrate populations in
   the Southern California Eight during the past two decades partly reflect
   a general warming of the area and an improvement in environmental
   conditions as wastewater treatment has improved.}},

Abstract = {{The Marine Bioassay Project (MBP) was initiated in 1984 by the State
   Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to design and develop sensitive
   test protocols to measure toxicity of discharges to marine waters. Many
   toxicity tests previously in use were relatively insensitive because the
   adverse effect measured was lethality to adult organisms. A newer
   generation of tests developed by the MBP has been designed to estimate
   more subtle long-term adverse effects of waste discharges that
   ultimately may damage populations of important marine species.
   The work of the MBP was mandated in 1986 by addition of Section 13170.2
   to the California Water Code. This Section directed the SWRCB to
   ``develop bioassay protocols to evaluate the effect of municipal and
   industrial discharges on the marine environment{''}. The project
   consists of four different entities, the SWRCB, the Department of Fish
   and Game (DFG), the University of California at Santa Cruz, and the
   Scientific Review Committee (SRC), an independent group of advisers
   representing industry, academia, and government. The contribution of
   each group is as follows: (1) the SWRCB plans, administers, and funds
   the MBP, (2) the DFG provides research facilities for the MBP at the
   Granite Canyon Marine Pollution Studies Laboratory, (3) the University
   of California at Santa Cruz provides the principal investigators and
   necessary staff to conduct the research, and (4) the SRC provides MBP
   the scientific guidance and focus to successfully conduct their
   research.
   The MBP has developed and implemented four toxicity test methods using
   species indigenous to California's coastal waters. These tests reflect
   recent advancements in the field of aquatic toxicology and have a broad
   taxonomic representation. The test methods use an alga (giant kelp), a
   fish (topsmelt), and two invertebrates (red abalone and Pacific mysid
   shrimp). The giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and red abalone (Haliotis
   rufescens) are currently on the 1990 Ocean Plan approved list of
   critical life stage protocols for use in National Pollutant Discharge
   Elimination System compliance monitoring. The mysid (Holmesimysis
   costata) and topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) protocols will be added to
   the list if the proposed 1996-1997 Ocean Plan amendments are adopted by
   the SWRCB in March 1997.
   All four of the methods developed by the MBP have been adopted by the
   U.S.EPA for use in compliance monitoring of waste discharges along the
   entire west coast of the United States (California, Oregon, and
   Washington). They constitute the majority of the tests published in
   U.S.EPA's West Coast Procedures Manual and have been pivotal in
   evaluating the potential effect of municipal and industrial ocean
   discharges on California marine life.}},

Abstract = {{Until the late 1960s, Northern Goshawks, Accipiter gentilis
   atricapillus, were considered rare breeders in Wisconsin. Research
   initiated in 1971 revealed a small but growing breeding population,
   which continued to increase until the mid-1980s when depredations by
   mammalian predators began to reduce numbers. Since 1985, reproduction
   has fallen below the estimated threshold of 1.7 young fledged/active
   nest needed to maintain a stable population. The reintroduced Fisher,
   Martes pennanti, is largely responsible for increased nest failure and
   adult female mortality, with the turnover rate of nesting females having
   doubled to over 40\%. Twenty-two years of reproductive data reveal a
   correlation between population levels and the 10-year wildlife cycle.
   The goshawk has been listed as a ``sensitive species{''} since 1986 in
   the Nicolet National Forest, and guidelines have been established for
   nest site protection. However, no such standards exist for state, county
   and private lands, where populations are declining. Legal and illegal
   ``take{''} of nestling goshawks is a continuing concern, especially as
   nest sites under national forest management become more vulnerable to
   falconers, who have taken an estimated 5\% of young from monitored
   nests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines two areas to be considered in developing
   conservation plans for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): goal statements
   and the general framework for the: implementation of a conservation
   plan. From a biological perspective, the appropriate conservation unit
   for Atlantic salmon is the Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). As
   conservation decisions will rarely be based solely on biological
   information, the Operational Conservation Unit (OCU) is defined as
   resulting from the interplay between biological requirements and
   socio-economic issues. A multi-scale habitat inventory of Atlantic
   salmon rivers to know what their status is relative to historical
   conditions is the first step in a functional conservation plan. The
   viability of salmon populations may be assessed according to 6
   variables: abundance, resilience, age and size structure, sex ratio,
   spatial and geographical distribution. A genetically viable population
   possesses the species' evolutionary legacy and the genetic variation on
   which future evolutionary potential depends. Four factors important to
   monitoring changes in a population's genetic health are genetic
   diversity, effective population size, genetic bottlenecks and founder
   effects and gene flow. Implementation of a conservation plan must be
   proactive to maintain the quality of the OCUs. Commercial and
   recreational fisheries need to be limited and several case studies are
   reviewed. The importance of avoiding the introduction of exotics and
   minimizing the impact of sampling methodology, as well as the pitfalls
   of plantings eggs, fry, or parr, are addressed. Finally, the importance
   of fostering public awareness of the value of conservation is essential
   to apply the political pressure necessary to preserve natural resources.}},

Abstract = {{The status of the White-faced Ibis (Plegadis chiki) in the Great Basin
   is of concern because of its small population size and the limited and
   dynamic nature of its breeding habitat. We analyzed existing annual
   surrey data for the White-faced Ibis breeding in the Great Basin and
   surrounding area for 1985-1997. Methods varied among colonies and
   included flight-line counts and fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter
   surveys. The number of White-faced Ibis bleeding pain in the Gt eat
   Basin area has nearly tripled since 1985, despite years of severe
   flooding and drought at major breeding areas. This growth is reflected
   in both peripheral (i.e., Oregon, California, Idaho) and core (i.e.,
   Nevada and Utah) components of the population. Our data on colony
   dynamics in Oregon and Nevada illustrate the ability of the highly
   nomadic White-faced Ibis to compensate for poor conditions at
   traditional colony sites by moving among colonies and rapidly colonizing
   newly available wetlands. We suggest that the White-faced Ibis would
   benefit from a landscape mosaic of well-distributed peripheral wetlands
   and persistent colony sites. The nomadic nature of the White-faced Ibis
   and the dynamic nature of their breeding habitat necessitates that
   wetland management decisions and population monitoring be conducted in a
   regional context.}},

Abstract = {{In order to monitor barley and weed development on a loamy sand soil
   subjected to different agronomic practices, field experiments were
   conducted for three growing seasons (1992-95) in a semi-arid agrosystem
   in central Spain. For eight years, independent plots were managed with
   three crop sequences: barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-->vetch (Vicia sativa
   L.); barley--> sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.); and a barley
   monoculture. In all cases, two tillage systems were implemented:
   no-tillage and conventional tillage. In the years with standard rainfall
   (400 mm) an improvement in growth-related cultivation variables and
   yield components of barley were observed in plots under barley-->vetch
   rotation and/or conventional tillage. In drier conditions (<350 mm) the
   growth rate, crop yield and yield components of barley tended to improve
   under the no-tillage system. Barley-vetch rotation and/or conventional
   tillage increased nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) content in barley plants.
   Similar results were found for the concentrations of nitrogen (N),
   phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium(Mg). In
   addition, the plots under crop rotation showed a weed biomass with a
   high concentration of N, K, and Ca in comparison with plots under
   monoculture. The lack of spring herbicide treatment in the no-tillage
   plots led to a 3-fold increase in weed density compared with the plots
   under conventional tillage.}},

Abstract = {{The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modelling the incidence
   of cyanobacteria in rivers was investigated by forecasting the
   occurrence of a species group of Anabaena in the River Murray at Morgan,
   Australia. The networks of backpropagation type were trained on 7 years
   of weekly data for eight variables, and their ability to provide a
   4-week forecast was evaluated for a 28-week period. They were relatively
   successful in providing a good forecast of both the incidence and
   magnitude of a growth peak of the cyanobacteria within the limits
   required for water quality monitoring. The use of lagged versus unlagged
   inputs was evaluated in the implementation and performance of the
   networks. Lagged inputs proved far superior in providing a fit to the
   actual data. Sensitivity analysis of input variables was performed to
   evaluate their relative significance in determining the forecast values.
   The analysis indicated that for this data set for the River Murray, flow
   and temperature were the predominant variables in determining the onset
   and duration of cyanobacterial growth. Water colour was the next most
   important variable in determining the magnitude of the population growth
   peak. Plant nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus and iron, and turbidity were
   less important for this time period. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Plantago major is a variable species that occupies a wide range of open
   habitats with a herbaueous canopy. Previous studies have shown that
   individuals from habitats where the canopy is kept short by mowing have
   a higher reproductive allocation than individuals from habitats with a
   tall canopy. The present study was conducted to determine whether or not
   the cost of reproduction differed between these two habitats. Fifteen
   half-sibling families, selected from a ranee of habitats differing in
   canopy bright were grown in the laboratory. Reproduction was controlled
   experimentally by photoperiod manipulations, and vegetative and
   reproductive plants of each family were transplanted to either a mown
   (short canopy) or unmown (tall canopy) grass sward in the fall of the
   first year. Number of leaves, length and width of largest leaf, and
   capsule production were monitored over the next 18 months. Total shoot
   biomass was determined at the end of this period. Cost of reproduction
   was assessed in threeways, by i) comparing the subsequent performance of
   vegetative and reproductive individuals, ii) calculating the phenotypic
   correlation between reproductive output in the first year of growth and
   subsequent performance using only those individuals that reproduced in
   the first year, and iii) calculating the above correlations at the among
   family level. Regardless of method used, cost of reproduction was
   smaller in the mown than in the unmown plots, suggesting that
   differences in cost among habitats may be involved in selecting for
   different allocation patterns.}},

Title = {{Using the normal range as a criterion for ecological significance in
   environmental monitoring and assessment}},
Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{542-550}},
Abstract = {{Data from monitoring programs are often used to compare a potentially
   impacted location with unimpacted: reference locations. Regardless of
   the experimental design, both statistical and biological criteria are
   frequently used to judge the significance of observed differences. In
   this paper, we define ecologically relevant differences as observations
   from impact locations that fall outside the normal range of variation
   based on reference-location data. We also define the normal range as the
   region enclosing 95\% of the population of reference-location
   observations. This 95\% region can then be expressed generically as
   either standard deviations (univariate) or generalized distances
   (multivariate). Such re-expression allows far the construction of
   appropriate null hypotheses and statistical tests that determine the
   probability that a test location Falls within the normal range. We
   evaluate the ability of three statistical tests (traditional two-sample
   contrast, and non-traditional equivalence and interval tests) to detect
   when test locations lie outside of the normal range of variation. For
   locations that are truly outside of the normal range, traditional
   two-sample contrasts will lead to erroneous conclusions of no impact
   about 50\% of the time when there are 10-20 reference locations in the
   design. In contrast, for locations truly outside the normal range of
   variation, equivalence tests will lead to erroneous conclusions of no
   impact at most 5\% of the time, regardless of sample size. The penalty
   associated with this test is that locations that are truly just inside
   the limits of the normal range will have a high probability of being
   declared impacted. For locations truly inside the normal range of
   variation, interval tests will lead to a conclusion of impact at most
   5\% of the time. The penalty associated with this test is chat locations
   that are truly impacted may not be declared impacted unless effects are
   very large. When evaluating an impacted location with respect to a set
   of reference locations, we caution that one must consider these
   characteristics of the tests when attempting to judge significance.}},

   Data from the Kamish Bay monitoring program during 1960 - 1969 was used
   in addition with data of recent studies carried out by the IBSS-NASU and
   the IMS-METU on the distribution of Black Sea zooplankton. Results have
   shown, that the Acartia productivity has decreased 1.5-4 fold depending
   on the region. The maximal decrease took place in the north-western
   Black Sea. Decrease in the total copepod production, caused by the mass
   invasion of Mnemiopsis, was estimated as no less than ten fold in the
   north-western inshore areas of the sea.}},

Abstract = {{A whole-lake manipulation of food-web structure (introduction of a top
   predator, northern pike, to a minnow-dominated lake) was performed in a
   Canadian Shield lake (L110) to examine the stoichiometric consequences
   of changes in planktonic community structure generated by altered
   food-web structure. Minnow abundance, zooplankton biomass and community
   composition, microconsumer abundance, and concentration and
   carbon-phosphorus (C:P) ratio of suspended particulate matter were
   monitored in L110 and unmanipulated L240 before (1992) and after
   (1993-95) pike introduction. Algal biomass in L110 determined from
   microscopic examination for postmanipulation and premanipulation periods
   was also compared with dynamics in a suite of unmanipulated reference
   lakes from longterm monitoring records. Pike were added in spring in
   1993 and 1994 in sufficient quantity to raise pike biomass to levels of
   around 22 kg ha(-1) by 1994. Minnow populations in L110 responded
   dramatically, decreasing to levels 30\% (1993), 10\% (1994), and less
   than 1\% (1995) of premanipulation values. However, most components
   lower in the food web did not respond in a manner consistent with
   predictions of existing food-web theory, such as the idea of cascading
   trophic interactions (CTI). While Daphnia biomass increased in L110 in
   the first year following manipulation, consistent with CTI, this effect
   was temporary and Daphnia collapsed in 1995, the year of lowest minnow
   abundance. Total zooplankton biomass in both lakes declined during the
   study period and, contrary to CTI, this decline appeared somewhat
   stronger in L110 than in L240. Dominant microconsumers (heterotrophic
   microflagellates) did not differ among years in either lake and did not
   appear to respond to food-web manipulation. At the bottom of the food
   web, no changes in bacterial biomass occurred in either lake. However,
   total concentrations of particulate matter appeared to increase in L110
   after manipulation (contrary to expectations based on the theory of CTI)
   while algal biomass did not change in the manipulated lake relative to
   reference systems. Finally, particulate C:P increased in both L110 and
   L240 during the study period. The lack of strong response of Daphnia,
   the lack of response of the microbial food web, decreases in zooplankton
   biomass and increases in particulate biomass following reduction of
   minnow populations after piscivore introduction are at odds with
   expectations from existing food-web theory, such as the idea of CTI as
   currently formulated. However, the extremely high C:P ratios in
   particulate matter at the base of the food webs in these lakes, the
   coincidence of zooplankton declines and increases in particulate C:P
   ratios, and the results of small-scale mesocosm food-quality experiments
   are consistent with a hypothesis of a stoichiometric constraint
   operating on food-web dynamics in this and similar ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Water habitats belong to ecostabilising elements in urban and secondary
   developed ecosystems settled unevenly by Amphibians. A study of
   amphibian species evaluated their status and the development of their
   population in urban ecosystems on the territory of the city of
   Bratislava. For a stock-taking survey, use was made of the method of
   field monitoring during the course of periodic expeditions (1991-1993).
   The author recorded qualitative-quantitative data, also taking note of
   the nature of aquatic habitats and found 15 species in the environs of
   Bratislava (91 monitored localities), and 11 species in the area of the
   Gabeikovo power station (8 localities). Data were processed on the
   occurrence of amphibians, typology and classification of water habitats
   (using the following indices: the index of originality, quality,
   ecological topic unit and the index of ecological stability). Finally,
   an aggregative index of habitat significance was determined.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding behaviour, excretion rate, and life history traits of the
   cotton-melon aphid, Aphis gossypii (Glover) (Homoptera, Aphididae), were
   measured on a resistant melon, Cucumis melon L., breeding line, AR 5.
   The site of resistance detection by the aphids was determined using the
   electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique. EPG recordings showed that
   resistance is expressed within the host plant, rather than on its
   surface, because the time to first stylet penetration was not
   significantly different between AR 5 and the closely related susceptible
   breeding line, PMR 5. EPG patterns associated with stylet pathway
   activities of the aphids were not significantly different between the
   resistant and susceptible lines. Significant behavioural differences
   were observed only after stylets contacted phloem sieve elements. On AR
   5, the duration of salivation after sieve element puncture (waveform E1)
   was significantly longer, and the number of aphids showing phloem sap
   ingestion (waveform E2) was significantly reduced. We conclude that the
   resistance mechanism producing the effects seen in this study acts
   within the phloem sieve elements. Monitoring of excretion rates on the
   two genotypes showed that aphid feeding was delayed and greatly reduced
   on the resistant genotype. Comparisons of aphid life history traits and
   population development between host plant genotypes showed that the
   effects of resistance act throughout aphid development and are highly
   effective at slowing down population increase.}},

   richness, adult flight period and distribution of butterflies in an
   agricultural environment in southeastern Finland in the years 1991-1995.
   Butterflies were monitored once a week from early May to late September
   on a 2.5-km field boundary transect. During 107 counts, a total of 49
   species and 6112 individuals were observed. More than half of all
   individuals (56\%) were observed in July. The results of multivariate
   analyses indicated that the occurrence of species was related to three
   habitat types, classified as field margins dividing arable field and
   coniferous forest, arable field and deciduous forest and two arable
   fields. Species richness was higher in field margins near forests than
   in margins between two fields.}},

Abstract = {{A number of diverse technological options are being considered for the
   remediation of contaminated soil in Kuwait. A bioremediation technique
   involving the use of composting soil piles was selected among the most
   appropriate methods and evaluated at pilot scale. The experiment was
   initiated in November 1992 at the Burgan oil field in which soil piles
   were constructed from the contaminated soil after amendment with
   necessary soil additives. The piles were subjected to regular:
   irrigation and turning over and a monitoring program including monthly
   soil sample collection from each pile in which the petroleum hydrocarbon
   concentration, PAHs, microbial population, and dry substances were
   measured. The results obtained showed that the windrow soil pile system
   resulted in a significant reduction of oil contamination within 10
   months. This paper describes the technology used and summarizes the
   results obtained. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Workers exposed to environmental pollutants at a waste disposal site
   were studied for genotoxic effects with cytogenetic tests and the comet
   (alkaline single-cell gel) assay. Analyses were performed on peripheral
   blood samples of 44 workers at a waste disposal site (DM) and 47
   subjects of a control group (VE) matched for gender, age, and smoking
   habits. Chromosomal aberrations were evaluated in 1,000 lymphocytes per
   individual, sister chromatid exchanges in 50 cells, and DNA migration
   (tail moment) was determined in 100 leukocytes. Structural chromosome
   aberrations were more Frequent in DM than in VE, but only the frequency
   of acentric fragments and the percentage of aberrant cells (excluding
   gaps) was significantly increased. No significant difference was found
   for the mean frequency of SCE. A statistically significant difference
   was also seen with the comet assay. The mean tail moment was higher in
   DM than in VE. However, no correlation was found between cytogenetic
   data and the effects in the comet essay. The results of our study
   indicate that DNA effects in the comet assay represent an independent
   endpoint which might be useful for the biomonitoring of genotoxic
   effects in addition to established tests. Environ. Mol. Mutagen.

Abstract = {{The influence of several methodological factors on mean values of sister
   chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and micronuclei (MN) in peripheral
   lymphocytes of 1,650 subjects was analyzed. Donors belonged to a general
   healthy population living in Pisa and in two nearby smell cities:
   Cascina and Navacchia (Ca-Na). Blood samples were collected over a
   period of 29 months and processed in three different laboratories of the
   same institute. Slides were analyzed by several scorers.
   Our data showed that lymphocyte proliferation indexes (Pls) and baseline
   mean values of SCEs were affected mainly by sampling period. This factor
   accounted for a percentage ranging from roughly 10\% (Pisa) to 20\%
   (Ca-Na) of total SCE variance and from roughly 10\% (Pisa) to 13\%
   (Ca-Na) of total Pls variance. A marginal effect was attributable to the
   different laboratories involved (maximum 3\% for SCEs and 7\% For Pls).
   The sampling period variable included many sources of variability such
   as culture media batches, fetal calf serum, PHA, BrdUrd, and
   seasonality.
   MN counts revealed a more marked dependence on processing laboratories.
   This factor accounted For a percentage of roughly 10\% (Pisa and Ca-Na)
   of total variance, while the sampling period was marginally effective
   (about 1-4\% of total variability). Because laboratories were equipped
   and sup plied with the same materials and consumables and technicians
   were rotated constantly, the only variable ascertained was represented
   by the three different models of CO2 incubators used for lymphocyte
   culturing. When ``month{''} and ``incubator{''} variables were
   considered jointly, experimental variability accounted For 15-20\% of
   total variance, both for Pls and mean values SCEs and MN. The
   variability due to slide scoring was reduced by assigning each slide to
   five different scorers and matching low with high scorers in each group.
   Present data show that when the study is performed under these
   controlled conditions, about 20\% of total interdonor variability can be
   explained by experimental or seasonal Factors. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) analysis was
   carried out on 1,650 healthy individuals living in Pisa and in two
   nearby small cities, Cascina and Navacchio (Ca-Na). The effect of
   smoking on SCEs was linearly correlated with the number of cigarettes
   per day, and an increase of 7.3\% SCEs was detectable for as few
   cigarettes as 1-10/day. Ex-smokers showed intermediate mean values of
   SCEs (8.09 +/- 1.88) in comparison with never smokers (7.54 +/- 1.61)
   and current smokers (8.45 +/- 1.94). Mean values of SCEs of ex-smokers
   decreased linearly with time of smoking cessation, reaching the mean
   values of never smokers within 8 years. The extent of SCE decrease was
   inversely proportional to the number of cigarettes previously smoked. No
   interaction between smoking habits and coffee or alcohol drinking on
   SCEs was observed. A borderline (P = 0.053) increase in mean SCE values
   in coffee drinkers (more than 3 cups/day) was found. The age effect on
   SCEs was remarkable in Ca-Na, but not in Pisa donors. Job type was not
   associated with significant modification of mean values of SCEs.
   Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a statistically
   significant association between the proportion of high frequency cells
   (HCF) outliers and coffee consumption. Age and sex appeared to be by Far
   the most important variables associated with modifications in MN
   frequency, which increased by 0.04 parts per thousand and 0.02 parts per
   thousand per year in males and females, respectively. Children and young
   donors (age less than or equal to 40 years) showed lower MN frequency
   regardless of sex, whereas sex appeared to determine a significantly
   higher increase of MN only in females older than 40 years. In contrast,
   in males the MN rate by age tended to level off after the age of 30-50.
   MN frequencies of Pisa blue-and white-collar workers were statistically
   significantly higher than in students (+0.71 and +0.55 parts per
   thousand, respectively). Smoking did not determine any increase of MN
   frequency, A total lock of correlation (P = 0.913) between MN and SCEs
   was observed. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the genotoxic effects of occupational
   acrylonitrile (ACN) and dimeihylformamide (DMF) exposures, clinical
   serum and urine parameters and genotoxicological endpoints such as
   chromosome aberration (CA), sister chromatid exchange (SCE), high
   frequency SCE (HFC), cell cycle kinetics, and UV-induced unscheduled DNA
   synthesis (UDS) were followed vp th ree times du ri ng a 20-month period
   in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of 26 workers (13 maintainers and
   13 fiber producers) occupationally exposed to ANC and/or DMF in a
   viscose rayon plant, 26 matched control subjects, and six industrial
   controls (all males). Six of the 26 exposed subjects were hospitalized
   because of liver dysfunction that had developed due to inhalative DMF
   exposure. The rate of smoking was estimated on the basis of serum
   thiocyanate (SCN) levels. Average peak air ACN and DMF concentrations
   were over the maximum concentration limits at the time of both
   investigations. Urine ACN and monomethyl-formamide (MMF) excretions of
   the exposed subjects were almost doubled after work shifts. An increase
   in lymphocyte count (in months 0 and 7), and severe alterations in the
   liver function were observed in the exposed subjects. In PBLs the
   proliferative rate index (PRI) was already increased in month 0 compared
   with the controls. In each study, significant increases in CA and SCE
   frequencies, as well as increases in UDS were found in PBLs of the
   exposed subjects. The frequencies of chromatid breaks and acentric
   fragments further increased in month 7 and remained constantly elevated
   in month 20. Increased yields of both chromatid and chromosome-type
   exchange aberrations First appeared in month 20, when HFCs were 2.72
   times more frequent in fiber producers than in maintainers. The role of
   some important biological confounding Factors (age, white blood cell
   count, and hematocrit) and lifestyle confounding factors (smoking and
   drinking habits) were subjected to an analysis of variance during the
   second study. Increased CA, SCE, and UDS were found both in control and
   exposed smokers when current smoking was established on the basis of the
   serum SCN levels. The cytogenetic data suggest that occupational
   exposures to ACN and DMF induce considerable genotoxic consequences and
   may increase the cancer risk in the exposed human populations. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Coastal areas are in general characterised by high on-going levels of
   population growth and domestic water demand. Major sources of pollution
   are urbanisation and overpumpage of aquifers. The result is an increase
   in salinity and pollution from sea water intrusion and other
   high-salinity sources, and from anthro-pomorphic percolation from ground
   surface to the water table. The purpose of this study is to delineate
   guidelines to identify preliminary signals of groundwater salinisation
   in areas under high land-use contamination pressure, and under impact of
   stress-management.
   The study is based on analyses of groundwater chlorographs and
   nitrographs of wells located along the Israel and the Gaza Strip Coastal
   aquifers, in inland areas with high anthropogenic activities, as well as
   in areas where groundwater under stress-management is influenced by sea
   water intrusion. In these areas, Cl- graphs indicate that after some
   years of monotonous behaviour corresponding to a steady-state flow
   regime, a fluctuation rate of 3 to 5 years sets in previous to the onset
   of final assault of groundwater salinisation. This intermediate stage
   can be considered an early-warning signal, occurring most clearly when
   the contaminant source is as. massive as sea water. In the other cases,
   the amplitude of the fluctuation stage also depends upon properties and
   magnitude of contaminants, the flow regime, and aquifer matrix
   characteristics. Such observations enable the undertaking of early
   operational activities needed to rectify adverse groundwater quality
   trends, as well as planning and choosing adequate aquifer remedial
   measures. Such graphs can therefore be utilised as a tool for
   groundwater quality monitoring and control.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity monitoring involves recurrent observations and recording
   changes and trends based on established biological benchmarks. The
   development of biological indicators at each level of the biodiversity
   hierarchy (landscape, community, species/genetic) is required to monitor
   and assess human impacts on natural populations and habitats. Genetic
   diversity is the ultimate source of biological diversity, providing the
   raw material for adaptation, evolution and survival of individuals and
   species - and becomes especially important to species survival in
   changing environments. Some indicators for monitoring population
   viability (which are defined here in the narrow sense as genetic
   diversity and reproductive success) in small, isolated populations of
   white pine, Finns strobus L., red pine, Pinus resinosa Ait., and white
   spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, from the Island of Newfoundland
   (NF), Canada, are discussed as examples for monitoring the effects of
   small population size and increasing fragmentation on genetic diversity
   and reproductive behavior. Results with these populations suggest that
   reproductive success may provide better indicators for monitoring the
   effects of recent population declines, particularly in the early phases
   of population decline, than many of the standard genetic indicators.}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out in the south of the Iberian Peninsula in an
   industrial area (Huelva city) and in two natural areas ('Reserva
   Biologica de Donana' in Donana National Park and `Isla Cristina'
   Marshland Natural Park), located windward and leeward of the industrial
   area, to estimate genetic risk induced by environmental pollution in
   wild mice. Mutagenetic effects in Algerian mice (Mus spretus) free
   living in the industrial area and the range of contamination on other
   populations of the same species living in the two natural protected
   areas, were investigated. Micronucleus test on bone marrow and
   peripheral blood was used to detect genetic alterations. A statistically
   significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei was observed in
   animals from the industrial area and from the Donana Biological Reserve
   in comparison with those from `Isla Cristina' marshlands. The results
   suggest that the mutagenicity level in natural populations living in
   protected areas should be controlled, and wild mice could be used as key
   organisms in pollution monitoring and environmental conservation. (C)

Abstract = {{Radionuclides (Pb-210, Po-210, Th-230, and Th-232) and chemical Th and U
   were measured in water, sediments, and fish tissues (bone, muscle, and
   gut contents of laketrout, Salvelinus namaycush, whitefish, Coregonus
   clupeaformis and Prosopium cylindraceum) from four lakes in a watershed
   affected by U mining and milling operations at Elliot Lake, Ontario, and
   from control lakes in an adjacent, non-industrialized, watershed.
   Radionuclide concentration ratios between tissue levels and sediment and
   water levels were calculated. Annual radionuclide intakes and resulting
   doses were estimated for humans consuming fish from the watershed. Bone
   Pb-210 levels were higher (186 mBq g(-1) dry wt in laketrout and
   (230)mBq g(-1) dry wt in one lake whitefish) than in muscle (< 50 mBq
   g(-1) dry wt in all cases), and generally higher in fish from study
   lakes than from controls, but no consistent differences were observed
   among fish species. Similarly, Po-210 levels were higher in bone (208
   +/- 33 mBq g(-1), in laketrout) than muscle (maximum 26 +/- 4 mBq g(-1),
   in laketrout), and in study lake populations compared to controls.
   Laketrout Po-210 bone concentrations were higher than previously
   reported in Canada. Levels of Th-230, Th-232, and Th were below
   detection limits (20 mBq g(-1), 0.05 mu g g(-1)) in body tissues in all
   fish species. Bone levels of U (14.6 +/- 3.0 mu g g(-1), in lake
   whitefish) were higher than in muscle (most < 0.05 mu g g(-1), except
   0.12 +/- 0.04 and 0.08 +/- 0.03 mu g g(-1) in lake whitefish) in fish
   from waters affected by industrial activity. In control lakes, bone and
   muscle levels were lower and not significantly different from each
   other. Muscle levels did not vary consistently with location.
   Concentration of Pb-210 and U was seen from water and `gut' material
   (taken as a surrogate for diet) to bone in laketrout and whitefish, and
   of U from water to muscle in whitefish, but in no case from sediments to
   tissues. Human intakes of Pb-210, Po-210, Th-230, Th-232, and U from
   consuming one meal of fish (375g) per week could, in aggregate,
   represent an annual effective dose < 15\% of the public dose limit (5
   mSv). Monitoring biota living near the decommissioned Elliot Lake U
   operations, especially of Pb-210 levels in fish muscle, with further
   assessment of human doses attributable to local fish and other animals
   in the diet, should continue. Because radionuclide effects on fish
   health (and on other non-human organisms) are of increasing concern,
   neoplasms, malformations, and reproductive anomalies in local fish
   deserve examination. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater contaminated with 500-1200 mu g/L trichloroethylene (TCE)
   was treated in situ over a 410-day period by cometabolic biodegradation
   through injection of 7-13.4 mg/L toluene, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide
   in groundwater circulated between two contaminated aquifers through two
   treatment wells located 10 m apart. One well pumped contaminated
   groundwater from the 8 m thick upper aquifer to the 5 m thick lower
   aquifer, while the other pumped contaminated water from the lower to the
   upper aquifers using flow rates of 25-38 L/min, effecting groundwater
   circulation between them. Following 18 days of periodic toluene
   injection to develop an active biological population, continuous pulses
   of toluene were added. Over 312 days, an average 87 +/- 8\% TCE removal
   was obtained in the upper aquifer with each pass through the treatment
   well. In the lower aquifer, removals were 83 +/- 16\% over the last 79
   days when peroxide addition was reduced. Treatment reduced TCE in the
   regional groundwater plumes from about 1000 mu g/L in new water entering
   the 480 m(2) monitored treatment zone to an average of 18-24 mu g/L in
   groundwater leaving the treatment zone, indicating total TCE removal of
   97-98\%. Pumping heads for groundwater recirculation were less than 6 m.
   Toluene was removed by 99.98\% through biodegradation to an average of
   1.1 +/- 1.6 mu g/L at the 22 m x 22 m boundaries of the study zone, well

Abstract = {{Field applications are presented for four sites where data has been
   collected for at least one year to demonstrate natural or enhanced
   transformation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) in
   groundwater. At three of the sites empirical trends or data was
   available to indicate on going natural transformation of the CAHs. At
   the fourth site, empirical data was lacking, and therefore the
   collection of biological data was necessary to evaluate the microbial
   population at the site prior to enhancing the subsurface environment.
   The collection of biogeochemical data was necessary at all of the sites
   to provide further evidence of the presence of degradation end products
   or of conditions favorable to natural degradation of the CAHs. This data
   was collected using low flow sampling procedures following the U.S. EPA
   and Air Force protocols. The sites contain several different primary, or
   source CAHs, including vinyl chloride, cis -1,2 DCE, and TCE. Geologic
   conditions vary at the sites from very permeable sandy alluvium to low
   permeability silty clays to karstic limestone. One of the sites is a
   Superfund site. Two of the sites employ in-situ reactive zones to
   enhance the rates of natural reductive dechlorination of CAHs; one of
   the sites is a natural attenuation only site, and one site is a
   candidate for enhanced reductive dechlorination.
   The results obtained to date indicate that the natural attenuation of
   the CAHs is a readily proven process in the field. In some cases, the
   natural rates of degradation are sufficient as a final remedy for
   groundwater. However, at the majority of the sites a deficiency in
   organic carbon (electron donor or substrate), electron accepters, or the
   presence of only slightly reducing conditions is stalling the complete
   reduction of the CAHs, or resulting in slow rates of reductive
   dechlorination. In these cases, injection systems have been designed to
   deliver carbohydrates and/or additional microbial populations to the
   subsurface. Monitoring for specific indicators (such as CAH
   intermediates) and parameters (such as ethenes, ethanes, ORP, dissolved
   oxygen and others) is necessary before beginning injections (to
   establish baseline conditions) and throughout the field test. The
   collection of these data are necessary to present to regulators the
   permanent degradation of the CAHs without excessive dilution or flushing
   effects.
   The sites have CAH concentrations in the range of 100 ug/L to 20 mg/L.
   Data collected from the two enhanced reductive dechlorination sites has
   shown dramatic reductions in source CAH concentrations over the last
   year. Degradation has resulted in 70 to 100\% reduction in source
   concentrations in both the ug/L and mg/L regimes. Both continuous dilute
   weekly injection systems (in more permeable environments) and single
   less dilute batch injection have been utilized. Delivery of the reagents
   is a limiting factor that is directly related to the hydraulic
   conductivity of the site. At all of the sites presented, results were
   evident between one month and 6 months, depending on groundwater
   velocities. Ongoing work is needed in the areas of reagents, such as
   mixing of different electron accepters and substrates and also in the
   area of modeling.}},

   or growth to maturity.{''} Threats to habitat and steps necessary to
   ameliorate those threats also had to be identified. Information from
   fisheries scientists and managers throughout the country will be needed
   to accurately identify essential fish habitat and habitat threats and to
   monitor the effectiveness of protective measures that come into force
   once habitat has been identified as essential. My vision, which is also
   that of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is no
   further loss of habitat quantity and quality as well as the preservation
   and restoration of habitat biodiversity by the year 2004. The essential
   fish habitat provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act provide an
   outstanding opportunity for the National Marine Fisheries Service, the
   Councils, and our numerous partners from every sector of society to
   develop new ecosystem approaches to fishery management addressing
   cumulative impacts to habitats in a comprehensive, effective, and
   efficient manner.}},

Abstract = {{The Coquille watershed contains the largest coastal river originating
   within the Coast Range of Oregon. The Coquille River presently supports
   over 57 species of fish including coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch,
   spring and fall chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, resident and sea-run
   cutthroat trout O. clarki, winter steelhead trout O. mykiss, and a
   remnant population of chum salmon O. keta. Coho salmon have been listed
   as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Many factors including
   habitat alterations, harvests, hatchery introductions, and ocean
   conditions have led to the decline of many Coquille River fish stocks.
   Habitat changes since European settlement began in the mid-1800s include
   logging and log transport, road building, draining and diking for
   agriculture, and urbanization, which have all contributed to the decline
   of fish stocks and water quality within the watershed. The recognition
   of habitat problems as a key limiting factor for fish production and
   water quality led to the formation of the Coquille Watershed Association
   (CWA) in early 1994. The formation of the CWA was another step in a
   20-year local effort to address habitat problems through restoration of
   natural processes. The CWA is organized as a nonprofit corporation and
   is governed by a 26-member executive council representing landowners and
   stakeholders within the watershed. The goals of the CWA, which arrives
   at decisions through consensus, include creating water duality
   conditions that will meet Clean Water Act standards and enhancing native
   fish survival and production through public and private partnerships. To
   reach those goals, the CWA has organized a technical advisory group and
   developed an Action Plan that address limiting factors and sets
   priorities for identifying, prioritizing, coordinating, accomplishing,
   and monitoring restoration projects and educational efforts. To date the
   CWA has generated over US\$2.5 million in public and private funding to
   implement projects including riparian restoration through fencing and
   planting, wetland development, the addition of large-channel wood and
   rock, off-channel livestock watering, and over 40 educational tours.}},

Abstract = {{During the 1970s, a number of projects were initiated in France directed
   towards the conservation and rehabilitation of migratory fish stocks.
   Stemming from these efforts, four relatively large fish passes were
   built between 1984 and 1989 on the Garonne and Dordogne rivers in
   south-west France. Two are pool-type fish passes (one with a double
   vertical slot at Bergerac on the Dordogne River, and the other with a
   single vertical slot at Le Bazacle on the Garonne River); the other two
   are fish elevators (Golfech on the Garonne River and Tuilieres on the
   Dordogne River). This chapter describes the characteristics and
   operating constraints of each installation.
   Since construction, operations have been monitored on a more or less
   (dependent on site) constant basis using a semi-automated video counting
   device which provides precise data on the quantity and timing of fish
   passage. The four installations have enabled passage of some 30 fish
   species, including migratory diadromous populations of Atlantic salmon
   Salmo salar, sea-run brown trout Salmo trutta, allice shad Alosa alosa,
   European eel Anguilla anguilla, sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, and a
   number of so-called `sedentary' species such as roach Rutilus rutilus,
   bream Abramis brama, and barbel Barbus barbus for which very clear
   migration rhythms have been nonetheless observed. Passage of allice
   shad, which has often been difficult to achieve over traditional fish
   passes, has been found satisfactory in both the pool and elevator
   installations, with annual passage of several tens of thousands of
   individuals (80 000 to 86 000 shad at the Tuilieres and Golfech fish
   elevators in 1995). The relative effectiveness of each type of pass is
   discussed in relation to the various migratory species. Finally, the
   main results concerning the seasonal and daily migratory rhythms of
   various diadromous and resident species are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The age structure and status of the U.S. southern Atlantic stock of
   black sea bass were examined using recorded and estimated landings and
   size frequencies of fish taken from commercial, recreational, and
   headboat fisheries during 1979-1995. Fishery-independent data were
   obtained from the Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment, and
   Prediction (MARMAP) program for calibrating virtual population analysis
   (VPA). MARMAP collected black sea bass with four gear types:
   hook-and-line (1979-1995), blackfish trap (1979-1989), Florida snapper
   trap (1980-1989), and chevron trap (1988-1995). Reduced effort with the
   hook-and-line gear in 1988 coincided with reduced catch per effort
   (CPE). The size fraction of fish captured with chevron trap was similar
   to the Florida snapper trap, but dissimilar to the blackfish trap.
   Hence, an extended time series of CPE was developed combining the
   Florida snapper and chevron traps. We examined the effect of different
   combinations of CPE indices (individually and in combination) on
   estimates of fully recruited fishing mortality, spawning stock biomass,
   and spawning potential ratio using the FADAPT VPA approach.}},

Abstract = {{Astacus leptodactylus was introduced into Swiss waters decades ago.
   Today big populations can be found in many lakes and ponds. Often they
   occur together with native or other introduced crayfish species. We
   suppose that A. leptodactylus may displace Astacus astacus and probably
   also Austrapotamobius torrentium from ponds and lakes, I investigated
   the life cycle and life history of A. leptodactylus in a pond and a lake
   (Chatzensee Pond, Lake Ageri) in Switzerland. The two populations were
   monitored monthly by SCUBA-diving and reproduction, growth and activity
   characteristics were recorded. The sex ratio in both populations was
   1:1. Females had activated glair glands at the end of September. The
   mating took place in the second half of December at a temperature of 3.5
   to 6 OC. The females spawned at the end of December and carried the eggs
   until the end of May in Chatzensee Pond and until mid June in Lake
   Ageri. The average incubation time of the eggs was 151 days for the
   population in Chatzensee Pond and 172 days for the population in Lake
   Ageri. The size of the smallest mature female was 34 mm carapace length
   (CL). 100\% maturity was found at a size of 43 mm CL in Chatzensee and
   46 mm in Lake Ageri. The average number of eggs per female was 173 in
   Chatzensee and 180 in Lake Ageri and varied between 60 and 400 eggs per
   female. The egg size varied between 2.34 mm and 3.33 mm with an average
   egg diameter of 2.77 mm in Chatzensee and 2.76 mm in Lake Ageri. Bigger
   females had more and bigger eggs. A. leptodactylus was found to be
   active day and night. Day activity was high during the mating season in
   December and low in late winter and spring. In May, July and October the
   crayfish were mainly active during the night. The males moulted in May
   and the females later after hatching of the juveniles in June
   (Chatzensee) and at the beginning of July (Lake Ageri). The second main
   peak of moulting was in September. In their first year juveniles reached
   an average size of 19.5 mm CL in Chatzensee Pond and 19.8 mm CL in Lake
   Ageri.}},

Abstract = {{The Lake Berezno (Gdov District, Pskov Region) is a part of a joint
   water system of Lake Berezno, Lake Orlovo and a river connecting them.
   Before the 1960s this system was inhabited by a large population of
   Astacus astacus. In Lake Berezno crayfish were found until 1968.
   Historical data on the crayfish population in this water system and new
   data(1993-1997) on the hydrobiology and hydrochemistry of Lake Berezno
   are reviewed. The results of the crayfish introductions after 1985 are
   presented, including the initial crayfish stock, size classes, sex
   ratio, and male and female sizes. At present, the crayfish quantity is
   0.4 specimens/m(2). To achieve a commercially exploitable population
   density of 4 specimens/m(2) it is necessary to introduce 413,250
   animals. Therefore, the construction of a special pond-nursery using
   semi-intensive technology for production of crayfish juveniles is
   continuing at the lake's bank. The juveniles and summerlings produced
   are to be stocked in the lakes Berezno and Orlovo to restore the
   crayfish stocks in these areas. Another objective of this work is to
   examine the ecological role of crayfish, their contribution to the
   processes of eutrophication, and the use of Astacus astacus for
   monitoring the quality of waterbodies.}},

Abstract = {{In order to monitor crayfrsh populations in Sweden, considerable effort
   is put into test-fishing crayfish each year. There are, however, large
   differences in purpose, ambition and resources when monitoring crayfrsh
   populations. As a result almost no test-fishing is performed according
   to a general standard, and therefore hardly any comparable data
   concerning fishing results have been collected. To overcome this problem
   a standardised crayfish monitoring protocol was developed and presented
   in 1997. The aim was to achieve a balance between obtaining enough
   information to be able to analyse the data with some precision, and
   making the effort small enough to get most people to follow the
   standard. The people taking part in the programme and sending in their
   protocols would get an evaluation of the crayfish population in their
   lake or stream in return. The purpose of this paper is to describe a
   standardised methodology. It turned out to be difficult to get people to
   send in the protocols and a large part of the received protocols did not
   contain all the necessary information. Reasons for this and ways to
   improve the return are also briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Corsica has a system of hillbrooks propitious to crayfish
   life, as evidenced by previous studies. Austropotamobius pallipes
   pallipes (Lereboullet, 1858) occurs in the eastern part of Corsica and
   was sampled in 1978 for the first time. The crayfish was probably
   introduced from the European continent. The animals were released in a
   small brook running down the eastern part of the island. We have
   monitored this population regularly from 1978 to 1997. In the first
   years, without competitors and diseases the crayfish population
   increased rapidly. The overpopulation of the first settlement has
   induced a natural migratory spread resulting in colonisation of further
   brooks. Poaching and a heavy meteorological event have been responsible
   for a decrease of the crayfish population in the mid 1990s. Nevertheless
   the adaptability of the animals is very dynamic inducing now a recovery
   of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Variation at three microsatellite loci was examined in four natural
   populations of the West african catfish Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus:
   Senegal, Selingue Dam (river Niger in Mall), Ebrie lagoon (Ivory Coast)
   and Volta Lake. One farmed population, Sial (Societe ivoirienne
   d'aquaculture lagunaire) in Ebrie Lagoon was also examined. The number
   of alleles was high in all three loci (29 to 30) and the number of the
   average number of alleles per population varied from 22.0 to 6.67.
   Smaller heterozygosities were observed in Selingue dam and Sial farm,
   whereas the three natural populations had higher and comparable
   heterozygosities. Between 17\% to 60\% of alleles were ``private{''}.
   On the basis of neutrality and random mating, one can compare effective
   population sizes. The five populations appear to fall into three
   categories in this respect: Niger Dam and Sial Farm are the smaller,
   followed by Volta, followed by Senegal and Ebrie. Most populations are
   in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. An exception is the sample from Senegal
   river, at Dagana, where a trend for excess of homozygotes is present in
   all loci, with significant values for two out Of three loci.
   Based on these three loci a factorial analysis of correspondence of all
   specimen studied provides a good assignment of individuals to
   populations. These results show that microsatellite is the tool of
   choice for population monitoring, preservation of genetic diversity and
   breeding programs in aquaculture.}},

Abstract = {{According to recent development in landscape ecology, monitoring bird
   populations within defined habitat patches may not be sufficient to
   evaluate population changes at a larger scale. In order to develop a
   quick-and-easy regional bird monitoring system capable of evaluating the
   effects of both population and habitat changes, we planned and tested a
   random sampling design over a study area as wide as 23,842 km(2),
   corresponding to the administrative region of Lombardy (Northern Italy).
   A sampling design based on randomly selected point counts was drawn. The
   region was divided into a number of districts, each of them composed of
   eight census units. A breeding bird survey was then organised over a
   period of eight years, to cover one unit per district in one year so
   that, at the end of the project, a quantitative breeding atlas should
   also be attained. Two pilot surveys were run in 1992 and 1995, by
   performing respectively 417 and 749 point counts, and by detecting
   24,347 and 26,619 birds (pertaining to 128 and 129 species). During the
   field work we also recorded habitat and environmental variables, in
   order to relate trends to habitat changes. After data standardisation,
   we obtained population indices of 32 common species. We validated our
   indexing system by analysing changes in population levels at
   sub-regional and ``between habitats{''} scales.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale movements and migration of red deer, Cervus elaphus, are
   monitored by hunters in Hungary. Red deer cause most part of the game
   damages in the forest management and in the agriculture. Loss by game
   damage and gain on hunting occurs separately at different management
   units at different times. To study land use 31 deer (12 stags 19 hinds)
   were radiotracked during 2-25 months. Additionally track- and resting
   place counts were made. Mean home range size of stags was 6697ha (SD =
   5078; min: 1774 ha, max: 17748 ha) and 2555 ha of hinds (SD = 1890; min:
   40 ha, max: 6244 ha). Hinds used significantly smaller areas than stags.
   Annual cycles were found in habitat selection. In winter the entire
   population concentrated on a forested area. in spring 8 hinds and 2
   stags spread out to the surrounding agricultural lands. However the
   track- and resting place counts showed that in every season more deer
   stay in the forest than go out. The possible causes of this home range
   shift are not known exactly One hypothesis is that agricultural lands
   are the better habitat in a growing season. Another hypothesis is that
   the stress by human disturbance causes fleeing. Social interactions may
   also have effect on the shift. Acceptance or rejection of these
   hypotheses need further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa, populations often show a very bad
   reproductive success in the Centre of France. In order to understand
   why, two populations were monitored over two years in spring and summer
   using radiotracking. One population (5 to 10 pairs per km(2)) lives in
   an open-field area mainly used for cereal or industrial crops. Grey
   partridges, Perdix perdix, are present there too at a comparable density
   The second population lives in a more closed habitat mainly composed of
   uncultivated lands (disused farmland), pastures and small vineyards or
   cereal fields. The density of these red-legged partridges is lower than
   in the open-field area and there are very few grey partridges. One
   hundred partridges were marked and were located daily for at least one
   week. We recorded the survival rate of adults till mid-August, the
   nesting rate (proportion of females surviving up to July Ist and known
   to have brooded at least once), clutch size, egg hatchability: nesting
   success and the chick survival rate. The chick survival rate is the only
   demographic parameter showing a significant difference between the two
   areas. It is quite null on the area with disused farmland while medium
   on the other one. The low mean nesting rate (65\%) and nesting success
   (41\% of all nests did hatch) reveal a great problem of nesting on both
   areas, mainly expressed by predation. Nests in hedges were lost
   significantly more often than others. Double nesting was observed on
   both areas, 22\% of the monitored males were located sitting on eggs.}},

Abstract = {{Waterfowl hunting is a potentially disturbing activity that needs to be
   managed for the benefit of both the hunted and other waterfowl
   populations, hunters, conservationists and other interest groups. Too
   frequently however, assessments of disturbance fail to define the term
   adequately or to distinguish between manageable disturbance effects and
   undesirable population impacts. Too often is disturbance caused by
   hunting presumed to be harmful without substantiation. Consequently the
   sustainability of hunting is questioned and unwarranted restrictions are
   sought.
   In the 1960s a national wildfowl conservation policy prepared jointly by
   hunting and conservation interests in the UK, recognised the benefits of
   hunting-free refuges to hunters and conservationists. Many refuges have
   been established, often by hunters themselves and often jointly managed,
   on most wetland sites supporting important waterfowl populations. Many
   have since undergone adjustments and enlargements, although largely ad
   hoc, in response to perceived needs. Their overall benefits are clear
   from the continuing health of the waterfowl populations wintering in the
   UK.
   But hunting, increasingly is only one of many potentially disturbing
   recreational and other activities on wetland sites. Focusing on hunting
   alone may be unsound, unfair and indicative of prejudice. To be most
   effective and acceptable for waterfowl management refuges need to be
   disturbance-free not just hunting-free.
   Studying and quantifying all the effects of hunting disturbance
   inevitably has proved difficult. A major hunter/conservationist study,
   however, provided practical guidelines to assist refuge establishment
   and management, including agreed management objectives and criteria for
   success, detailed monitoring of bird and human usage, and regular
   management reviews. A complex and costly scientific approach is not
   always possible or appropriate. Objectivity is important but pragmatism,
   adaptive management and consensus are essential too. The UK experience
   shows that they can work to the benefit of waterfowl, wetlands, and
   their many users.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of wildlife research in Cyprus is to collect data for
   management programs for wildlife species. Every year the Game and Fauna
   Service (Game Fund) estimates the average number of birds and mammals
   shot by each hunter. Since 1992, I have studied the breeding biology of
   the woodpigeon, Columba palumbus, and the turtle dove, Streptopelia
   turtur. My objective is to establish the most appropriate time for the
   summer hunting season. About 100 000 to 150 000 captive bred chukar,
   Alectoris chukar cypriotes, are released every year to reinforce the
   wild population. Since 1996 I marked 121 birds with radiotransmitters to
   study dispersal, survival, and breeding success. More than 90\% of these
   birds were killed by predators in the first three months. Studies with
   radiotransmitters also commenced in 1996 with released captive bred
   hare, Lepus europaeus cyprius, and in 1997 with captive bred
   reintroduced black francolins Francolinus francolinus. From the
   protected bird species we are studying the breeding biology of the great
   tit, Parus major aphrodite, the barn owl, Tyto alba, and the griffon
   vulture, Gyps fulvus. For the migratory species the Game fund is
   monitoring the population numbers of the water birds at Larnaca Salt
   Lake. With a team of scientists from the University of Sassari we are
   studying the hemoglobin chain structure and the DNA of the Cyprus
   mouflon, Ovis gmelini ophion. This is going to help us establish
   taxonomic and evolutionary relationships with other species of wild
   sheep. With the cooperation of the Veterinary Service of Cyprus we are
   studying the mortality and decimating factors of the Cyprus mouflon. In
   addition, we examine mouflon and red fox, Vulpes vulpes, for
   Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis. Finally, I monitor the
   population numbers of the Fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus.}},

Abstract = {{Clearly human manipulation and exploitation have taken the projected
   tolls in aquatic ecosystems, and show little promise of relent. The
   contrast between the successes of the two contemporary approaches to
   better understanding aquatic systems ecology, one based on principles of
   empirical physiological ecology, and the other based on parameterized
   population dynamic responses, is invoked to explain the present
   impoverished status of marine fisheries management. Decades have passed
   with few or no good examples of how to secure either `sustainable
   yield', or even how to define it in a rational context. Given the
   historical perspectives on global patterns of climate-driven resource
   variabilities, the basic `stability' concept is certainly inappropriate
   as a prime objective. Basic tenets of economics and general ecological
   principles have also been ignored as one resource population after
   another has been `defined', regulated, negotiated, and litigated, while
   being systematically decimated in the name of economic stability, and
   short-term profit racing. Within this same period the numbers of
   environmental and resource scientists have multiplied, yet the results
   of their efforts have been devastation, not conservation. Peer-induced
   mediocracy through vetted agency fund chasing has replaced quest for
   applicable knowledge. In fact, we have come full circle, to the point
   where all the emergent observing technologies and information systems
   that were suggested to be enhanced during the late 1960s and 1970s for
   needed monitoring of resource habitats and ocean and atmosphere systems,
   so that ecological resource status could be understood, have been
   dismantled, their promoters retired or moved on, and replaced by a
   generation of inept resource modellers. Agency funds, once available for
   primary research, are increasingly squandered on bureaucratic councils,
   committees, and litigation. It is no wonder that we are having to start
   over again, to link knowledge that we have had, with system knowledge
   that we could not obtain, to manage resources that are already pressed
   beyond any reasonable limits, by social systems that are in perennial
   denial.}},

   since then are presented in this paper. In the Netherlands, a biological
   monitoring programme has revealed populations of M, cf, wireni in the

   estuary) a large population has developed (2000-3000 individuals m(-2);
   8-16 g ash-free dry weight m(-2)). Since the introduction, the
   macrozoobenthic community has changed from being dominated (by biomass)
   by bivalves, to domination by polychaetes. Recently, a similar
   population started to develop at Balgzand (western Dutch Wadden Sea).}},

   under well-defined environmental conditions at different supply rates of
   a unicellular algal food (Chlorella vulgaris). Rotifer size frequency
   distributions are described for conditions of steady-state growth,
   exponential increase, and starvation. Temporal fluctuations in size-age
   structure are described for cultures during transient conditions during
   the approach to a steady state and following step changes in food supply
   rate. The size structures of the populations displayed definite and
   reproducible shifts among typical patterns during transient conditions,
   reflecting the physiological and other dynamic processes that underlay
   the population dynamics. Size structure probably is a key variable that

Abstract = {{We adapted a probiotic culture system originally developed for domestic
   animals and fish for the intensive culture of rotifers. In this
   modification, a crude starter fluid was made by incubating a mixture of
   some 40 species of bacteria (so-called Uchishiro Microorganisms) with
   the by-products of other food-related materials. The probiotic culture
   medium (PCM) was then completed by incubation of 50 g of starter fluid
   (25 degrees C) for 3-4 days in 1 L of 50\% sea water with strong
   aeration. After processing, the medium may be used as food for the
   rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. We determined the optimal levels for
   feeding B. plicatilis cultures by providing a starter culture of 100
   rotifers different concentrations of PCM and monitoring their population
   growth over five days. The highest population density of B. plicatilis
   (351 ind ml(-1)) was achieved from a mixture of 20 ml PCM per 1 L
   rotifer water. From these experiments, we conclude that PCM is useful as
   food for rotifer culture if it is supplied at a satisfactory
   concentration.}},

Title = {{Biological monitoring of eutrophication in rivers}},
Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{384}},
Pages = {{55-67}},
Abstract = {{There is an increasing awareness of the need to assess the impact of
   nutrient enrichment on river ecosystems separately from the impacts of
   organic effluents. A range of methods have been proposed and some have
   moved from the development stage to practical use by water management
   organizations. The methods can be applied to broad surveys or provide
   baseline information to assess possible future change. In the latter
   case it is recommended that several different methods are used,
   especially where it is important to get reliable information on the
   long-term impact of improvements in effluent quality.
   Estimates of biomass measured as chlorophyll a have often been used for
   phytoplankton and sometimes also for benthic communities. However, a lot
   of care is needed in applying this method, because of the range of
   factors besides nutrient concentration which can influence values.
   Approaches based on the whole community have been developed by a number
   of research groups, usually involving semiquantitative estimates of
   abundance. There has also been a rapid increase in the use of indices
   based on the relative proportions of epilithic diatom species. The
   methodologies used by a number of research groups in Europe are broadly
   similar, making it possible to compare results between different
   regions. The development of indices based on macrophyte floristic
   composition in relation to river nutrient status is also under
   development, especially in France and UK. However: interpretation of the
   results is complicated where long-term changes are taking place in
   nutrient concentrations in the water, because of the varying
   contributions of sediment and water to different species of rooted
   plant. Bioassays can be especially helpful where it is desired to
   establish whether either N or P is limiting for a population of
   community.}},

Abstract = {{A 15 month long experiment was undertaken to document responses of the
   Salton Sea biota to experimentally manipulated salinity levels (30, 39,
   48, 57, and 65 g l(-1)) in 312-liter fiberglass tanks maintained
   outdoors. At two salinities (39 and 57 g l(-1)) microcosms were set up
   each having one small tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in order to
   assess its influence on the system. To 28 tanks filled with Salton Sea
   water diluted to 30 g l(-1), different salts (NaCl, Na2SO4, MgSO4.
   7H(2)O, KCl) were added in constant proportions to produce the desired
   salinity levels. Salton Sea shoreline sediment was added to the bottom
   of each tank, and inocula of algae and invertebrates were added on
   several occasions. Invertebrate populations, phytoplankton, periphyton,
   and water chemistry were monitored at regular intervals. This article
   present the results concerning water chemistry and nutrient cycling.
   There was no apparent increase in salinity over time, though similar to
   1190 l of tapwater with a salinity of similar to 0.65 g l(-1) added to
   each tank during the experiment. Ionic composition varied both among
   treatments and over time to some degree. Ca-2 concentrations were the
   same at all salinities, while K-1 concentrations were > 3 times greater
   at the highest salinity than at the lowest. pH showed little consistent
   variation among salinities until the last few months when it was higher
   by similar to 0.4 units at the two higher salinities than at the lower
   ones; it was unaffected by fish. Absolute oxygen concentrations were
   negatively correlated with salinity, and occasionally depressed by the
   presence of fish. PO43-, dissolved organic phosphorus, and particulate
   phosphorus concentrations were often reduced by 30-80\% at 65 g l(-1)
   relative to lower salinities and by the presence of fish. Early in the
   experiment NO32- concentrations were > 2 times higher at 57 and 65 g
   l(-1) than at lower salinities, but otherwise effects of salinity on
   dissolved forms of nitrogen were not marked; particulate nitrogen was
   much lower at 65 g 1-1 than at other salinities and also was reduced by
   up to 90\% by the presence of fish. Silica concentrations increased over
   time at all salinities, but, relative to those at lower salinities, were
   reduced by 60-90\% at 65 g l(-1) by abundant periphytic diatoms. The
   TN:TP ratio (molar basis) was 24-30 initially and 35-110 at the end of
   the experiment; it was positively correlated with salinity and the
   presence of fish. Mechanisms accounting for the above patterns involve
   principally the biological activities of phytoplankton and periphyton,
   as modified by grazing by Artemia franciscana and Gammarus mucronatus,
   and the feeding and metabolic activities of the tilapia. The large
   reduction in water column TN and TP levels brought about by the
   fast-growing, phyto- and zooplanktivorous tilapia suggest that
   amelioration of the Salton Sea's hypereutrophic state might be assisted
   by a large scale, sustained yield fish harvesting operation.}},

Abstract = {{The Salton Sea is the largest inland lake in California. Currently
   (1997) the salinity of the lake is about 44 g l(-1) and is increasing
   gradually as a result of continued agricultural wastewater inflows, high
   evaporation rates, and lack of an outlet. A microcosm experiment was
   carried out to determine the effects of salinity (30, 39, 48, 57, and 65
   g l(-1)) on Salton sea algae and invertebrates in outdoor aquatic
   microcosms. The experiment war also designed to assess the affects of
   tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) on this community at two of these
   salinities (39 and 57 g l(-1)). Fiberglass tanks containing Salton Sea
   water were adjusted to the appropriate salinity by the addition of
   salts, identically inoculated with organisms from the Salton Sea and
   other saline water bodies in the region, and monitored for 15 months.
   Planktonic and nektonic invertebrates were sampled monthly at night from
   the upper pan of the water column. The dominant invertebrates present
   were gammarus mucronatus, Artemia franciscana, Trichocorixa reticulata,
   and an assemblage of ciliate protozoans. Gammarus decreased and
   Trichocorixa increased with increasing salinity. Artemia was present
   only at the two highest salinities, Rotifers, harpacticoid and cyclopoid
   copepods, barnacle larvae, and protozoans all showed marked and varied
   responses. During the latter hall of the experiment, the invertebrate
   assemblage was dominated by gammarus at 30 and 39 g l(-1), by protozoans
   at 48 g l(-1): and by protozoans and Trichocorixa at 57 and 65 g l(-1).
   The presence of tilapia caused a 99 percent reduction in gammarus at 39
   g l(-1) and a 70-90 percent decrease in Trichocorixa at 57 g l(-1).
   These were accompanied by substantial increases in rotifers, copepods,
   and certain protozoans, and decreases in other protozoans, As the
   salinity of the Salton Sea continues to increase, large changes in the
   invertebrate populations are expected. This study suggests that the
   principal change would be an increase in Trichocorixa densities, the
   loss of Gammarus, and the appearance of Artemia at about 60-70 g l(-1),
   when both fish and invertebrate predators are likely to be scarce or
   absent. Protozooplankton abundance is likely to increase when tilapia
   declines and later decrease when and if large Artemia populations
   develop.}},

Abstract = {{Two different tributyltin (TBT)-induced virilisation phenomena in
   prosobranch snails - intersex in Littorina littorea and imposer in
   Nucella lapillus - are compared in order to facilitate their
   simultaneous use in geographical large scale effect monitoring surveys.
   Imposer in dogwhelks is a more sensitive biomarker and should be used in
   areas that are only slightly or moderately contaminated with TBT
   (ambient TBT concentrations < 2.0 ng as Sn 1(-1)). The assessment of
   intersex intensities in periwinkle populations has considerable
   advantages in areas with higher TBT concentrations and should be used
   also wherever dogwhelks are absent if respective of the TBT exposure
   level. The intersex index (ISI) and vas deferens sequence (VDS) index
   are proposed as the most suited parameters for effect monitoring
   purposes; The geographical uniformity of intersex and imposer is
   analysed and proven for the coasts of Ireland, France, and Germany. A
   relative loss of TBT sensitivity in females can be found, but to a
   varying extent in both species. The implications of this result for
   biological TBT effect monitoring programmes are discussed in light of
   the fact that intersex and imposer have both been found to be
   irreversible. Because it is the objective of these programmes to assess
   current TBT contaminations and resulting biological effects, only
   relatively young specimens should be considered in the sampling
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{A mesocosm experiment was conducted in order to study the structure of
   the planktonic food web. The dynamics of pico-, nano- and microplankton
   populations were followed during 40 days in four large (40 m(3))
   enclosures. In three tanks a gradient of added nutrients (nitrogen and
   phosphorus) was applied, while a fourth tank was used as a control. On
   day 14, the top predator (sea bream Sparus aurata larvae) was introduced
   into the tanks and part of the water column in each tank was isolated in
   a plastic bag without fish larvae, to act as a control for predation.
   Physical parameters, chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations, as well
   as plankton concentrations were monitored. A diatom bloom was observed
   in all four tanks, in the first phase ending with silicate depletion.
   Flagellate and dinoflagellate abundance subsequently increased, these
   organisms being limited by zooplankton grazing. The zooplankton
   populations were controlled by both resources (mostly flagellates) and
   predation (by fish larvae) as indicated by the results of the control
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus in northern Spain were studied between 1969
   and 1994. The number of breeding pairs increased from 221 in 1969-1975
   to 1395 in 1994. The annual population growth rate decreased in the last
   5 years, and this may reflect population regulation through
   density-dependent phenomena, Breeding success was monitored in 1994 and
   examined in relation to colony size, density of breeding pairs within a
   radius of 25 km (regional density), climate, human disturbance and food
   availability, We also recorded whether the year of first occupation of
   each nest site was before 1989 or after 1989 and whether or not the nest
   had a rocky shelter. The probability of successfully raising young
   declined as the regional density increased, which suggests that resource
   limitation would take place at foraging sites because the Griffon
   Vulture scavenges socially and no permanent feeding hierarchies are
   established. The other significant variable was the year of occupation
   of the nest; nests occupied after 1989 had a lower probability of
   raising a chick. The increase in the regional density of Griffon
   Vultures produced a decrease in the productivity at both optimal and
   suboptimal nest sites. This suggests that density-dependent regulation
   of breeding success operates through interference and that all the
   individuals in a colony are similarly affected. In birds of prey,
   prevalence of interference or habitat heterogeneity may be dependent on
   the social strategy of each species in space exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a part of our studies on large-scale T-DNA-mediated
   gene tagging in Arabidopsis thaliana. To enhance the chance of tagging
   specific stress-responsive genes of this species by monitoring the
   preferential insertion of the T-DNA into the actively transcribed loci,
   we exposed the root explants to low temperature (LT), abscisic acid
   (ABA), and extracellular enzymes (EXE) of the plant pathogen Erwinia
   carotovora prior to transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Both LT
   and ABA reduced the frequency of transformation; with these treatments,
   the average transformation frequencies were 8.1\% and 2.6\%,
   respectively. However, in explants pretreated with EXE the
   transformation frequency was 89.0\%, similar to that obtained in control
   materials (92.6\%). Transgenic calli developed from these explants did
   not require any treatment with azacytidine (azaC) for efficient shoot
   regeneration. Furthermore, this treatment enhanced multiple insertion of
   the T-DNA into the plant genome; within a population of EXE-treated
   transgenic plants, the number of lines harboring at least three copies
   of the integrated T-DNA was much higher (61\%) than that observed in an
   untreated population (34\%).}},

Abstract = {{In an aircraft construction factory where adhesives containing Cr(VI)
   compounds were used, the risk of chromium exposure was studied by
   assessing airborne chromium levels and urinary levels of chromium
   excretion. Chromium exposure was evaluated by personal sampling over a
   period of 4 hr in a group of 16 occupational workers selected from a
   group of 55, Chromium absorption was determined by collecting urine
   samples from all subjects (n=55) at 3 different times: prior to the
   work-shift at the beginning of the working week and prior to and after
   the workshift at the end of the working week. Each urine sample was
   tested for chromium and creatinine concentration, Results showed very
   low exposure to airborne chromium, since values obtained (0.02-1.5 mu
   g/m(3), GM: 0.17, GSD: 5.34 mu g/m(3)) were significantly lower than the
   ACGIH Hygiene Standard (50 mu g/m(3)). Likewise, urinary chromium
   excretion (0.16-7.74 mu g/g creat,) was higher than excretion in the
   general population (0.07-0.17 mu g/g creat.) but lower than BEI-ACGIH
   (30 mu g/g creat.). The greatest difference between excretion levels
   measured before and after the workshift was 2.44 mu g/g creat, i.e. 4
   times lower than the difference proposed by ACGIH (10 mu g/g creat,).}},

Abstract = {{Formation of microbial biofilms on surfaces of a wide range of materials
   being considered as candidates for use on the International Space
   Station was investigated. The materials included a fibre-reinforced
   polymeric composite, an adhesive sealant, a polyimide insulation foam,
   teflon cable insulation, titanium, and an aliphatic polyurethane
   coating. They were exposed to a natural mixed population of bacteria
   under controlled conditions of temperature and relative humidity (RH).
   Biofilms formed on the surfaces of the materials at a wide range of
   temperatures and RHs. The biofilm population was dominated by
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ochrobactrum anthropi, Alcaligenes
   denitrificans, Xanthomonas maltophila, and Vibrio harveyi. The biocide,
   diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulfone, impregnated in the polyurethane coating,
   was ineffective against microbial colonization and growth.
   Degradation of the polyurethane coatings was monitored with
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The impedance spectra
   indicated that microbial degradation of the coating occurred in several
   stages. The initial decreases in impedance were due to the transport of
   water and solutes into the polymeric matrices. Further decreases were a
   result of polymer degradation by microorganisms. Our data showed that
   these candidate materials for space application are susceptible to
   biofilm formation and subsequent degradation. Our study suggests that
   candidate materials for use in space missions need to be carefully
   evaluated for their susceptibility to microbial biofilm formation and
   biodegradation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The leaf miner Liriomyza huidobrensis (Diptera: Agromyzidae) was first
   reported in Java, Indonesia in 1994. Since then it has invaded the major
   vegetable-producing regions of Java and Sumatra. Surveys indicate that
   this pest attacks over 20 species of vegetable, ornamental and weed
   hosts. The parasitoid Hemiptarsenus varicornis (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)
   was collected from L. huidobrensis-infested plant material in all the
   sites, and on 19 of the 20 cultivated species surveyed. Potatoes were
   the most severely attacked crop and nearly 100\% yield reduction was
   observed in some fields. The seasonal activity of the leafminer and its
   parasitoids was monitored on potato, scallions, and broccoli by
   collecting weekly leaf samples and holding them in containers in the
   laboratory until the flies or parasitoids emerged. Leafminer populations
   were most severe in potato, especially towards the end of the wet season
   (March 1996). Scallions and broccoli produced higher numbers of H.
   varicornis than leafminers.}},

Abstract = {{Life strategy and feeding relations of populations of the cyclopoid
   copepods were studied in two deep and stratified reservoirs in Czech
   Republic. Cyclopoid copepods were represented mostly by Cyclops vicinus
   and contributed significantly to the spring biomass of zooplankton.
   Long-term monitoring of seasonal dynamics and instar analysis were used
   to evaluate life strategy. Short-term feeding experiments in small
   containers irt situ! and long-term experiments in large plastic
   enclosures (1.7 m diameter, 8 m depth) constructed in one of the
   reservoirs were used to study the carnivorous feeding of cyclopoid
   copepods. Cyclops vicinus exhibited a pronounced seasonal changes of the
   population density and instar composition, with regular diapause and
   sharp spring increase of both density and feeding activity. Data are
   presented an the impact of its predatory feeding on herbivorous
   zooplankton species. The life strategy of Cyclops vicinus is clearly
   opportunistic using periods of available food far population
   increase:dense algal blooms in spring provide food for nauplii to
   survive and complete larval development and subsequent zooplankton prey
   to reach maturity and to produce eggs.}},

Abstract = {{Abundance, biomass and production of zooplankton was monitored during
   April-June in the Rimov Reservoir, Czech Republic. Gut content analyse
   of three dominant fish species, perch (Perca), roach (Rutilus) and bream
   (Abramis) was performed during the same period. The dominant year
   classes of adult perch were subjected to more detailed analyses of food
   ration. Consumption of planktonic prey was low before and during the
   peak of perch spawning (late April). An exponential increase of perch
   feeding activity coincided with the end of their spawning and with the
   formation of the warm epilimnion. Large-sized daphnids (adults>1.0 mm)
   were positively selected irrespective of their relative abundance. This
   was particularly important during the period of low density of daphnids
   in early spring when the population of perch was able to eliminate a
   significant proportion of the Daphnia production. Later, in the end of
   May, some perch (70\% of females, 18\% of males) switched to feeding on
   littoral organisms such as insect larvae, Polyphemus and cyprinid fish
   eggs, while the rest consumed pelagic zooplankton. Roach and bream
   consumed a wider spectrum of planktonic organisms including Bosmina and
   small Daphnia. Inability to prey on small plankton and the absence of
   larger prey items probably led to the collapse of the perch population
   in the subsequent two years.}},

   Lake Kinneret}},
Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{73-80}},
Abstract = {{From the beginning of detailed routine monitoring in 1968 (and probably
   before) until the end of 1993, annual and seasonal development of
   phytoplankton in Lake Kinneret showed a relatively constant pattern. In
   the late winter and early spring there were extensive blooms of the
   dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense, followed in summer and autumn by
   much lower standing stocks of predominantly nannoplanktonic
   chlorophytes. Although Microcystis spp. were prominent (usually
   concomitant with the dinoflagellates) in the early 1970s, subsequently
   this genus and other cyanobacteria were generally unimportant
   contributors to phytoplankton biomass. Since early 1994, however, a
   marked change in seasonal phytoplankton development has been noted.
   There were record high blooms of Peridinium in 1994 and 1995; in the
   following years, 1996 and 1997, no dinoflagellate bloom appeared. In the
   late summer and fall of 1994 an exceptional bloom of Aphanizomenon
   ovalisporum occurred; this was the first recorded instance of an
   outgrowth of a potentially toxic and N-2-fixing filamentous
   cyanobacterium in this lake. This organism has been observed in low
   numbers in each subsequent year. In 1995, 1996, and 1997 Microcystis
   also became prominent. Levels of primary production since 1994 have
   generally been higher than previous multi-annual averages.
   The quality of water in Lake Kinneret is to a large extent determined by
   the nature and activity of its phytoplankton community. Because of the
   lake's central role as a national supply source of good-quality water,
   the apparent breakdown of previously regular patterns of the annual and
   seasonal algal development is a cause for concern. Integrated research
   and monitoring are needed to fully explain the causes of the observed
   and ongoing changes and to provide guidelines for future management
   policies aimed at maintaining water quality in Lake Kinneret.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of tropical forest cover during timber extraction represents
   an extreme form of disturbance, with potentially far-reaching effects on
   fish biodiversity. Fish populations were quantified in streams running
   through a mosaic of unlogged and selectively-logged areas in Sabah, East
   Malaysia to assess these effects. A diverse assemblage of more than
   thirty species of fish were found in both sets of screams with little or
   no evidence of loss of biodiversity in streams in logged forest,
   although shifts in dominance were recorded from slow-water communities.
   Additional data were provided by monitoring fish populations before
   selective logging operations and for eighteen months subsequently.
   Increases in diversity and species number were recorded from one sire
   for 15 months from the start of sampling, but two other sites showed
   little change. Explanations for the persistence of the fish community in
   the face of high disturbance pressure include high rates of colonisation
   and movement from undisturbed areas and/or avoidance or tolerance of
   disturbance effects.}},

Abstract = {{The brown trout population of the River Gallo (central Spain) was
   monitored every two months during 1996 to determine the current impact
   of angling. To evaluate the influence of additional parameters, physical
   habitat and food availability were also studied. To assess fishing
   pressure, trout harvest and angling explanation, a partial creel census
   was conducted during the 1996 fishing season. Differences were found in
   densities and biomass between exploited (1182.4 Ch ha(-1), 68.3 kg
   ha(-1)) and unexploited areas, the latter being markedly higher (3135.1
   fish ha(-1), 208.2 kg ha(-1)). Production was quite superior in the
   unexploited area and decreased (from 144.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) to 37.2 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1)) as fishing pressure increased. However, no consistent
   differences were observed in growth, condition factor, age diversity,
   mortality, recruitment age and turnover ratio. Sport fishing seems to be
   the main negative factor influencing the balance within population of
   brown trout in thr River Gallo and therefore management should be
   focused on more restrictive angling measures.}},

Abstract = {{Three aquatic herbicides effective on the exotic weed Eurasian
   watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.)-2,4-D ((2,4-dichlorophenoxy)
   acetic acid), endothall (7-oxabicycol {[}2.2.1] heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic
   acid) and triclopr ({[}(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl) oxy] acetic
   acid)-were evaluated in the laboratory for selective effect or efficacy
   on the native submersed species, sage pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus
   L.). For each herbicide, three concentrations in ranges associated with
   Eurasian watermilfoil or sage pondweed control were applied ill static
   exposures of 24 hr, and plants were monitored for 35 d. Endothall at
   0.5, 1 and 2 mg L-1 significantly reduced final biomass, by greater than
   or equal to 72\%, confirming that this herbicide will not maintain
   populations of sage pondweed where it is used to manage Eurasian
   watermilfoil. Application of the growth regulator-type systemic
   herbicides at 1, 1.5 and 2 mg L-1 resulted in no significant reduction
   in biomass from 2,4-D, but up to 24\% reduction with triclopr. The more
   selective activity of these compounds towards sage pondweed supports
   their use for controlling Eurasian watermilfoil in plant communities
   where it is desirable to maintain the native species. However, in areas
   where sage pondweed is itself a nuisance plant, endothall gives
   effective chemical control.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental instability has been used to monitor the well-being of
   natural populations exposed to physical, chemical and biological
   stressors. Here, we use developmental instability to assess the impact
   of grazing on Chrysothamnus greenii and Seriphidium novum shrubs, and
   Oryzopsis hymenoides grass, common in the arid intermountain west of the
   U.S.A. Statistical noise in allometric relations was used as an
   indicator of developmental instability arising from grazing-induced
   stress. Unpalatable species that are not grazed (Chrysothamnus greenii)
   or species that are dormant during the winter-spring grazing period
   (Oryzopsis hymenoides) show lower allometric variability under high
   grazing pressure. Palatable species (Seriphidium novum) exhibit high
   developmental instability under low and high grazing pressure. Grazing
   pressure imposed by presumably co-adapted wild herbivores enhances
   developmental stability in species habituated to moderate grazing, like
   Oryzopsis hymenoides, but stresses plants such as Chrysothamnus greenii
   that prefer disturbed environments. These grazing effects are probably
   due to the impact grazing has on competitive relationships and not to
   the direct action of the herbivore on the plants. (C) 1998 Academic

Abstract = {{Molecular epidemiology currently offers laboratory methods (exposure,
   effect and susceptibility biomarkers) which enable determination of the
   relationships between exposure to harmful environmental agents and the
   incidence of some diseases at the level of the cellular genome. There
   has been particular interest in determining such relationships for the
   neoplastic disease. Currently, much effort has been devoted to using
   mutations of the suppressor gene p53 to achieve that goal. The gene p53
   seems to be an ideal biomarker which offers the possibility of detecting
   the earliest stages of carcinogenesis at the level of the cellular
   genome. Mutations in that gene constitute most frequent genetic defect
   found in all cancer types. The pattern of the mutations in the gene p53
   varies with the type of organ in which it is found and, to some extent,
   also with the type of exposure to a specific carcinogen. Thus, it is
   possible to identify such carcinogen and use the incidence of specified
   mutation type for the purposes of molecular dosimetry. Mutations in the
   gene p53, which result in the synthesizing modified p53 protein, can be
   determined by detecting that protein in the easily available blood
   serum. Detection of the p53 protein in blood serum can be used as a
   biomarker of early health effects in monitoring of populations exposed
   to environmental and occupational carcinogens.}},

   argentifolii Bellows and Perring (sweetpotato whitefly strain-B =
   silverleaf whitefly) are present in coastal South Carolina and to
   monitor their seasonal abundance. South Carolina is the northern
   geographic limit of year-round field populations of B. argentifolii in
   the eastern U.S. Yellow sticky cards were used to monitor the
   parasitoids. Parasitoid abundance varied over time and among five
   coastal South Carolina sweetpotato field locations where pesticide was
   not used. Five species of parasitoids were found (Encarsia pergandiella,
   E. nigricephala, E. strenua, E. quaintancei, and Eretmocerus sp.). The
   most abundant species were E. nigricephala and E. pergandiella (89\% in
   1993; 70\% in 1994). No parasitoid fauna of B. argentifolii had
   heretofore been reported from fields in South Carolina. This background
   information will aid in developing a biological control component in a
   management strategy for B. argentifolii.}},

Abstract = {{Weekly personal NO2 exposures of 246 children aged 3-6 years were
   measured with Palmes tubes during 13 weeks in winter and spring in 1991.
   Measurements were made in eight day-care centers in the downtown and
   suburban areas of Helsinki, Finland. At the same time, inside and
   outside NO2 concentrations of the day-care centers and the ambient air
   fixed site measurements were conducted. Palmes tubes were found to be
   applicable for NO2 exposure measurements of preschool children, but
   rather high sample losses could be expected. The geometric mean of
   personal NO2 exposure levels of 13-week period was 26.5 mu g/m(3) in the
   downtown and 17.5 mu g/m(3) in the suburban area. Gas stove and smoking
   at home increased significantly personal exposure to NO2. The weekly
   population NO2 exposures correlated rather poorly with the fixed site
   ambient air NO2 levels (R-2 = 0.37), but much better with the NO2 levels
   inside and outside the day-care centers (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.86). In the
   suburban and downtown groups the between children variations in the NO2
   exposures were only 14\% and 28\% of the total variations, which were
   dominated by the within child variation.
   Stationary measurements at the ambient air fixed sites and inside and
   outside the day-care centers explained the variation in personal
   exposures of the children well during the spring, but not during the
   winter. A regression model, where data from outside day-care center
   measurements, fixed ambient air monitors, residential area and home
   characteristics (i.e., gas stove, smoking inside at home, type of
   dwelling) were included, explained 32\% of the personal NO2 exposure
   variation in winter and 67\% in spring. In the absence of personal
   exposure measurements, both stationary measurements and questionnaire
   information are useful in estimating variations in personal exposures.}},

Abstract = {{Dramatic changes in the water quality of the Oswego River system,
   including Oswego Harbor, since the early 1990s brought about by zebra
   mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) infestation are documented. The analysis
   is based on summertime (June to September) water quality monitoring of
   the Oswego Harbor (1981 and 1993), the mouth of the Oswego River (1983
   to 1993), and three upstream sites in the Oswego River system (1990,
   1991, and 1994), and two benthic surveys conducted along a 70 km reach
   of the system to the mouth of the Oswego River in 1994. It is estimated
   that water in the Oswego River was filtered more than entice over this
   length by the mussels in 1994 (at median flow) before it reached Oswego
   Harbor. The zebra mussel infestation converted the Oswego River and the
   harbor from a turbid (low clarity), phytoplankton-rich,
   nutrient-depleted system, to a system with distinctly greater clarity,
   reduced phytoplankton concentrations, enriched in soluble reactive
   phosphorus. Most of this impact was attributable to dense zebra mussel
   populations (e.g., similar to 30,000 indiv/m(2)) in a 5 km river
   section, located > 60 km upstream of Oswego Harbor. These changes in
   tributary water quality represent a form of feedback associated with the
   spread of the zebra mussel from the Laurentain Great Lakes. Increased
   attached algae growth in the Great Lakes proximate to the inflow of
   infested tributaries is a reasonable expectation in response to the more
   available form of the phosphorous load.}},

Abstract = {{Feral ferrets (Mustela furo) and cats (Felis catus) are pests in New
   Zealand because they carry bovine tuberculosis (Tb) and prey on native
   fauna. We examined their behavioral responses to large-scale poisoning
   of their primary prey, feral European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).
   We monitored the movements of 70 radiocollared ferrets and 28
   radiocollared cats for 2 years during pre-and posttreatment periods for
   1 nontreatment (Earnscleugh) and 2 treatment (Bendigo, Grays Hills)
   populations in tussock grassland habitat on New Zealands South island.
   There were no changes (P > 0.05) in the mean home range size of ferrets
   on the Bendigo site (70 ha prepoisoning and 67 ha postpoisoning), where
   poisoning reduced rabbit numbers by 77\%, or on the Earnscleugh site (71
   ha prepoisoning and 61 ha postpoisoning), where rabbit numbers remained
   high. However when rabbit numbers were reduced by 99\%, ferrets on Grays
   Hills increased home range from 85 to 230 ha (P < 0.05), and their mean
   distance from range center increased from 475 to 993 m (P < 0.001).
   While most ferrets at Grays Hills remained resident, the proportion of
   ``mobile{''} ferrets increased from 1 of 25 to 6 of 18 (P = 0.015). For
   cats, treatment effects were less clear because sample sizes were low
   and data were highly variable. However, 3 adult cats at Grays Hills
   dispersed up to 9.2 km from range centers after rabbit numbers were
   reduced by 99\%. No obvious behavioral changes of predators were
   observed where rabbit declines were less pronounced or where rabbit
   abundance remained high. This observation suggests that large changes in
   predator movements occur only after very large disturbances to their
   primary prey, but there was insufficient replication of treatments to
   separate treatment effects from site effects. Nevertheless, our
   qualitative results indicate that very large reductions in rabbit
   populations in tussock grassland are likely to cause a small number of
   predators to disperse into adjacent areas. In the absence of a clear
   understanding of the role of ferrets and cats in the epidemiology of
   bovine Tb, and of their effects on native fauna, the implications of
   this. induced dispersal are unknown. Intuitively, however, any
   consequences are likely to be adverse.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed commercial harvest data from 1932 to 1993 for Mongolian
   gazelle (Procapra gutturosa), gray wolves (Canis lupus), corsac foxes
   (Vulpes corsac), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), Siberian polecats (Mustela
   eversmanni), Siberian marmots (Marmota sibirica), and Tolai rabbits
   (Lepus talai) from Dornod Aimag, Mongolia. Analyses were post hoc and
   harvests were probably biased by State-imposed harvest quotas;
   therefore, statistically significant harvest trends may or may not
   reflect population trends. Gazelle, wolf, marmot, and fox harvests
   demonstrated significant decreasing trends, while polecats and rabbits
   displayed no significant trends. Analyses suggest that
   government-imposed harvest quotas influenced actual harvests of marmots
   and foxes. The effect of year on actual harvests was important for
   gazelle, wolves, and marmots, and may reflect population changes.
   Reports suggest that poaching is an important source of mortality for
   gazelle and marmots. Several other studies report declines in numbers of
   Mongolian gazelle, which once migrated in the millions across most of
   Mongolia. Wolves are strongly disliked and heavily persecuted by local
   nomads, officials, and biologists at all levels of government. All
   species harvested commercially in Dornod Aimag require more careful
   conservation management to ensure the continued existence of viable
   populations. Currently, little management or monitoring is occurring.}},
