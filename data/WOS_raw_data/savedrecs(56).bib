Abstract = {{Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) invaded the Great Lakes in 1986 and
   are considered to be a nuisance species, because of their rapid
   population growth and their strong byssal attachment to a variety of
   man-made and natural surfaces. Research on possible antifouling
   materials or coatings has revealed few nontoxic substrates that even
   retard attachment of mussels. The influence of several substrate
   characteristics in combination (material, texture, orientation, and
   sunlight) on zebra mussel settlement was examined. Settlement of
   post-veliger mussels on experimental plates indicated that the mussels
   attached in higher numbers on upper versus lower horizontal surfaces,
   textured versus smooth surfaces, shaded versus sunlit surfaces, PVC
   versus Plexiglas, and plastic (PVC and Plexiglas) versus glass. Zebra
   mussels did not show strong preferences among several additional
   substrate materials (wood, Fiberglas, concrete, limestone, aluminum, and
   raw steel) but they strongly avoided galvanized steel. These results
   confirm field observations of locations in which mussels are most likely
   to be found. Information about zebra mussel substrate preferences may
   enhance the design of monitoring programs and the integrated management
   of mussels in vulnerable areas.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat features and ostracod populations were monitored monthly between
   December 1995 and September 1996 in three contiguous pools of a
   Mediterranean helocrene spring. Principal-components analysis (PCA) of
   the physical and chemical properties of the water showed that seasonal
   variations were minor in the site closest to the source (pool 1).
   Conversely, the site the most distant from the source (pool 3) had the
   greatest variation in temperature and oxygen and calcium contents.
   Differences in limnological factors, especially the equilibrium system
   of carbonates, among sites were also clear from the results obtained
   with PCA. The cosmopolitan ostracod Cypridopsis vidua predominated in
   pool 1, where variations in oxygen content and temperature were minimal,
   and showed a univoltine reproductive pattern. The crenophilous species
   Potamocypris villosa and Herpetocypris intermedia were the most abundant
   ostracods at the other two sites, where the development of filamentous
   algae and Characeae produced a high oxygen concentration and an increase
   in calcium carbonate precipitation. The latter two species both produced
   two generations per year. The small size of springs and their position
   between interstitial and surface waters make them excellent systems for
   the study of ostracod ecology and the influences of environmental
   factors upon their life-history traits.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored demography, movement, and reproductive behavior of
   gray-tailed voles, Microtus canicaudus, in experimental habitat patches
   with and without corridors to test the hypotheses that more individuals
   would move among patches in corridor than in control unconnected
   habitats, and that individuals would distribute themselves more evenly
   among patches if corridors were present than if they were not. We
   predicted that more males than females would move among patches in both
   treatments and that juveniles in control habitats would exhibit delayed
   sexual maturation if their dispersal was delayed and opposite-sex
   relatives remained in proximity to each other. All experiments were
   conducted in eight 0.2-ha enclosures planted with alfalfa that was
   fragmented into four patches (each 156 m(2)) separated by 12.5 m of bare
   ground. In four of the enclosures, patches were connected by 1 m wide
   habitat corridors. Corridors facilitated movements, with males moving
   more than females. However, corridors did not result in an even
   distribution of animals in the four patches. Unconnected habitat patches
   resulted in female-biased juvenile dispersal, and females dispersed at a
   lower body mass than males in both connected and unconnected habitats.
   Males that did not disperse from their natal patch grew at a slower rate
   than those that did disperse. We conclude that movement was deterred in
   patchy environments, enhanced by corridors, and differentially affects
   males and females. Behavioral factors that affect an individual's
   dispersal or reproductive pattern should be considered in landscape
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Although natal dispersal has received considerable attention from animal
   ecologists, the causes and consequences of breeding dispersal have
   remained largely unexplored. We used telemetry, direct observation, and
   long-term mark-recapture (9 yr) to study breeding dispersal in the North
   American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) at Kluane, Yukon,
   Canada. We recorded the postbreeding behavior (keep the territory, share
   it with juveniles, or bequeath it to juveniles) of mothers from 485
   litters, and monitored the fates of eight cohorts of weaned juveniles
   (680 individuals). The proportion of mothers that bequeathed their
   territory to one of their offspring was roughly one-third of that
   keeping or sharing it. Breeding dispersal was a recurrent phenomenon
   that characterized a fraction of the population of reproductive females
   every year. Dispersing females did not improve the quality of their
   breeding environment. In contrast, by leaving their territory, mothers
   allowed some offspring to stay on the natal site, which increased
   juvenile survival. Breeding dispersal by female red squirrels was thus a
   form of parental investment. Dispersing females were older than others,
   had higher numbers of juveniles at weaning, and moved their breeding
   sites more frequently after reproducing when food availability was high.
   These patterns are consistent with the major predictions of parental
   investment theories. We detected no difference in survivorship or future
   reproduction between dispersing and resident mothers. Juvenile males
   dispersed more often than females, but not farther. The sex of offspring
   did not influence whether mothers dispersed or not. Although we showed
   that breeding dispersal can have major impacts on the dynamics of
   squirrel populations, the relative implications of natal and breeding
   dispersal for the genetic structure and demography of populations and
   the social evolution of species remain unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that species with particular traits are at greater risk
   of extinction than others. We assumed that a decline in abundance in
   forest fragments, compared to continuous forest, equated to an increase
   in extinction risk. We then tested the relationships between five traits
   of species and decline in abundance for 69 beetle species in an
   experimentally fragmented forest landscape at Mt. Wog Wog in
   southeastern Australia. The experiment was controlled and replicated.
   Monitoring ran for two years before forest fragmentation; in this paper,
   we examine data for five years postfragmentation. We tested five
   hypotheses: (1) Species that occur naturally at low abundance are more
   likely to decline as a result of fragmentation than are abundant
   species. (2) Isolated species are more likely to decline than species
   that are not isolated. (3) Large species are more likely to decline than
   small species. (4) Species in trophic groups at the top end of food
   chains are more likely to decline than species in trophic groups lower
   in the food chain. (5) Because traits are often shared by related
   species, populations of more closely related species will respond in the
   same way.
   We found that: (1) rare species were more likely to decline than
   abundant species; (2) isolated species were more likely to decline than
   species that were not isolated; (3) body size was not correlated with
   response to fragmentation; (4) among species that declined, predators
   declined most; and (5) taxonomically related species did not respond in
   the same way to fragmentation. Thus, our results confirm theories
   predicting that isolated, rare, or predaceous species will be lost first
   from fragmented landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Elasmobranch fishes exhibit a series of complex courtship and mating
   behaviours in which males inflict significant bite wounds to the body of
   female mates. However, the variety and frequency of mating wounds are
   not known across a full reproductive season for any species. We examined
   the distribution and abundance of dermal wounds in adult Atlantic
   stingrays, Dasyatis sabina, which have a protracted and defined mating
   season to determine (1) if dermal wounds can be used as indicators of
   mating activity, (2) whether different categories of bite wounds can be
   associated with specific mating behaviours, and (3) whether the skin
   thickness in females is sexually dimorphic. Adults of both sexes showed
   fresh wounds during the full duration of the mating season
   (October-June) and there was no relationship between ray size and wound
   density. Females had more total wounds than males in every month with a
   maximum average of 20.2 wounds per female in April. Mating wounds were
   categorized into five distinct forms: single track, double track, bite,
   margin abrasion and excision. Wounds were randomly distributed over the
   body of males but concentrated on the posterior half of the disc in
   females. Each wound type occurred in approximately equal proportions
   among sexes with the exception of the precopulatory and
   copulatory-induced margin abrasions which accounted for 13.7\% of the
   total wounds in females but only 3.1\% in males. We suggest that the
   pronounced and concurrent appearance of single track, double track and
   bite wounds among males results from random premating courtship attacks
   by males because females cannot be visually discriminated. However, the
   concentration of wounds on the posterior disc of females is consistent
   with the possible presence of olfactory cues (e.g. pheromones) that are
   released at the cloaca. The pectoral fin dermis of females was 50\%
   thicker than that of males, which eliminated the excision of margins
   during male grasping and functions to reduce female injury. The temporal
   occurrence of wounds from October through June and peak in April is
   consistent with previous reproductive studies that show fresh sperm in
   the reproductive tract of females over the protracted mating period and
   also ovulation in late March or early April. The importance of social
   reproductive biting is discussed in relation to the reproductive
   induction hypothesis proposed to possibly explain the protracted mating
   of this species. Monitoring of dermal wounds provides a useful
   non-invasive technique to determine reproductive activity and a means
   for inference of social relationships in elasmobranch populations.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews exposure information available for
   trichloroethylene (TCE) and assesses the magnitude of human exposure.
   The primary sources releasing TCE into the environment are metal
   cleaning and degreasing operations. Releases occur into all media but
   mostly into the air due to its volatility. It is also moderately soluble
   in water and can leach from soils into groundwater. TCE has commonly
   been found in ambient air, surface water, and groundwaters. The 1998 air
   levels in mu g/m(3) across 115 monitors can be summarized as follows:
   range - 0.01-3.9, mean = 0.88. A California survey of large water
   utilities in 1984 found a median concentration of 3.0 mu g/L. General
   population exposure to TCE occurs primarily by inhalation and water
   ingestion. Typical average daily intakes have been estimated as 11-33 mu
   g/day for inhalation and 2-20 mu g/day for ingestion. A small portion of
   the population is expected to have elevated exposures as a result of one
   or more of these pathways: inhalation exposures to workers involved in
   degreasing operations, ingestion and in ha ration exposures occurring in
   homes with private wells located near disposal/contamination sites, and
   inhalation exposures to consumers using TCE products in areas of poor
   ventilation. More current and more extensive data on TCE levels in
   indoor air, water, and soil are needed to better characterize the
   distribution of background exposures in the general population and
   elevated exposures in special subpopulations.}},

Abstract = {{During the summers of 1991-1994, the Environmental Monitoring and
   Assessment Program (EMAP) sampled 344 lakes throughout the northeastern
   United States using a proportional stratified sampling design based on
   lake size. Approximately one-quarter of the 344 lakes were sampled each
   year (4 years) for total phosphorus to determine the proportion (and
   associated 95\% confidence intervals) of the northeast lake population
   greater than or equal to 1 ha (11,076 +/- 1,699 lakes) that was in
   oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, or heupereutropic (4 classes)
   condition according to the total phosphorus criteria of the North
   America Lake Manegement Society. Estimates for the second, third, and
   fourth yr were developed as cumulative of the previous yr samples and
   the current yr samples for the northeast as a whole and for each of its
   three ecoregions (4 regions). New confidence intervals were computed for
   each cumulative yr condition estimate. This produced a total (4 years x
   4 classes x 4 regions) of 64 cumulative yr tropic condition estimates.
   Confidence intervals for 21\% of these estimates did not shorten with
   increased sample size. This phenomena raised questions about the
   accuracy of estimates based on cumulative sampling procedures. We
   explain why and how the phenomenon comes about with both straight random
   and proportional random sampling. Further, we present an example of the
   effects this phenomenon has on lake tropic state condition estimates in
   the northeastern United States.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative genotype and toxin interactions at three polymorphic enzyme
   loci were examined in a laboratory population of amphipods (Hyalella
   azteca) during acute exposure to cadmium, zinc, copper, lead, or low pH.
   Significant toxin-genotype interactions were observed using logistic
   regression to model mortality in ten of 15 analyses. Both
   stressor-specific and nonspecific modes of selection were observed. In
   general, low DH selected for different genotypes than those selected by
   metals, especially zinc. Different modes of selection were also observed
   when amphipods were exposed to different metals. These results suggest
   that exposure to low pH would significantly reduce the ability of H.
   azteca survive subsequent contamination by metals; exposure to stressors
   in the reverse order would also compromise a population's chance of
   survival. A genetic distance analysis showed that the magnitude of
   genetic differentiation consistently increased among survivors compared
   with that of the initial populations. These increases in genetic
   divergence estimates suggest that acute exposure to metals or low pH may
   have an evolutionarily significant impact on the species. They also
   suggest that both genotype frequency and genetic distance measures
   (based on allozyme data) may be used as bioindicators for environmental
   monitoring programs. Validation of such bioindicators requires an
   understanding of the population's genetic background, genetic structure,
   and history.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the genotypic responses of Hyalella azteca to the
   toxicity of sediment contaminated by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
   (PAH) fluoranthene. We monitored the time to death fur 696 H. azteca
   exposed to ultraviolet light and sediment spiked with fluoranthene. The
   survival distribution functions within the genotypes at each of three
   variable allozyme loci (acid phosphatase {[}ACP{*}], glucose-6-phosphate
   isomerase {[}GPI{*}], and phosphoglucomutase {[}PGM{*}]) were compared
   using a log-rank test. Results shea-ed significant differences among
   SDFs at all three loci. No association of heterozygosity with time to
   death was observed. The homozygote ACP{*}-CC was associated with
   decreased survivorship compared with ACP{*}-AA, ACP{*}-BB, and
   ACP{*}-AB. However, GPI{*}-AA was associated with increased survivorship
   compared with GPI{*}-BB, GPI{*}-CC, and GPI{*}-BC. Significant
   differences in resistance also were observed for PGM{*}-BB versus either
   PGM{*}-AC or PGM{*}-BC. These results indicate that differential
   resistance to PAH phototoxicity was genetically related, producing
   significant alteration in the frequencies of several genotypes in the
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy integrals of photosynthesis by a cyanobacterial bloom in the
   Baltic Sea, during the summer of 1993, were calculated from the vertical
   distributions of light, temperature and the organisms in the water
   column and from photosynthesis/irradiance curves of picoplanktonic and
   diazotrophic cyanobacteria isolated from the community. The distribution
   of chlorophyll a in size-classes < 20 mu m and > 20 mu m was monitored
   over 9 days that included a deep mixing event followed by calm.
   Picocyanobacteria formed 70\% of the cyanobacterial biomass and
   contributed 56\% of the total primary production. Of the filamentous
   diazotrophs that formed the other 30\%, Aphanizomenon contributed 28\%
   and a Nodularia-containing fraction 16\% of the primary production. For
   the whole population there was little change in standardized
   photosynthetic O-2 production which remained at about 31 mmol m(-2)
   before and after the mixing event. There were differences, however,
   between the classes of cyanobacteria: in picocyanobacteria primary
   production hardly changed, while in Aphanizomenon it increased by 2.6
   and in Nodularia it fell below zero. Total phytoplankton photosynthesis
   was strongly dependent on total daily insolation with the compensation
   point at a photon insolation of 22.7 mol m(-2) d(-1). Similar analyses
   of N-2 fixation showed much less dependence on depth distribution of
   light and biomass: Aphanizomenon fixed about twice as much N-2 as
   Nodularia their; their fixation exceeded their own N demand by about
   12\%. Together, these species contributed 49\% of the total N demand of:
   the phytoplankton population. Computer models based on the measured
   light attenuation and photosynthetic coefficients indicate that growth
   of the cyanobacterial population could occur only in the summer months
   when the critical depth of the cyanobacteria exceeds the depth of
   mixing.}},

Abstract = {{The research objective was to develop pheromone-based monitoring of the
   nun moth, Lymantria monacha (L.), an important defoliator of spruce and
   pine forests in central Europe. In 38 spruce or pine forests in central
   Europe, captures of male L. monacha in nonsaturating Unitraps and
   saturating Delta sticky traps baited with 0.2, 2, 20, or 200 mu g of the
   L. monacha (pheromone) volatile blend {[}(+/-)-disparlure,
   (+/-)-monachalure, and 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene at a 20:20: 1 ratio] were
   compared with estimates of population densities obtained by counts of
   larval faecal pellets, pupal cases, and adult moths resting on tree
   trunks. Total captures of male L. monacha throughout the flight season
   in both types of trap were correlated with numbers of larval faecal
   pellets, irrespective of pheromone dose. Nonsaturating Unitraps baited
   with 2 mu g of the L. monacha volatile blend seem to provide a
   cost-effective tool for monitoring densities of L. monacha populations.
   Long-term testing of this monitoring system has been initiated to
   substantiate the quantitative relationship between larval populations
   and trap captures of male L. monacha and to determine the threshold
   number of captured male moths that indicates an incipient outbreak.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated exposure-relevant selection bias within the Framework of a
   study on personal air pollution exposure, using traffic data as exposure
   proxy. Based on random samples of 3000 (Basel) and 2532 (Helsinki)
   persons, 50 and 250 subjects, respectively, were recruited for direct
   monitoring and 250 (Basel, Helsinki) for indirect monitoring, in Basel,
   participants of direct monitoring as compared to non-participants were
   more likely to live at streets with low traffic volume (49\% below Ist
   quartile vs. 27\%). Adjusted for sex, age and nationality, an increase
   of 100 cars per hour was associated with 14\% less participation (odds
   ratio (OR): 0.861; 95\% CI: 0.731, 1.007). Although in Helsinki, traffic
   volume was neither significantly related to participation in direct nor
   indirect monitoring, the point estimates indicate a tendency to
   decreased participation with increasing traffic intensity at home. We
   conclude that selection bias regarding exposure-relevant characteristics
   is likely to occur when recruiting participants for studies including
   demanding personal exposure assessment. Correction for factors routinely
   collected may not fully account for exposure - relevant bias. This is of
   particular importance when using exposure data for modelling population
   exposure distributions, whereas in epidemiological studies, a reduced
   range of exposure must not a priori distort the exposure-response
   relationship.}},

Title = {{On the spatial scale needed for benthos community monitoring in the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{In community monitoring an attempt is made to identify long-term trends
   by regular sampling of selected sites. Since the benthos is reputed to
   be fairly sedentary, the spatial resolution is often reduced to single
   sites. However, members of many benthic invertebrate species have been
   found drifting across sedimentary seabeds in shallow waters.
   Transportation by currents may result in changes of their spatial
   pattern in the sediment, thereby changing local community composition.
   The quantitative importance of drifting was tested by repeated sampling
   of a 2-km(2) shallow (10 m) offshore area west of the island of Sylt
   (North Sea). Within the fortnight period between two samplings the
   benthic community composition had changed dramatically. Despite fairly
   calm weather, translocation of organisms by currents exceeded 1 km. In
   about half of the species, the spatial changes in abundance within these
   two weeks roughly equalled the average variation between consecutive
   years. This example suggests that community monitoring needs a wide
   spatial scale to discriminate long-term temporal changes From short-term
   variability. Extending the sampling area from 2 to 180 km(2) strongly
   reduced the variability of abundance estimates. However, only in a few
   species was the spatial distribution over the sampling sites found on
   one sampling date a suitable estimator for the spatial pattern found one
   or two months later, at the same sites. Instead the spatial patterns of
   the fauna changed strongly during a single month with a spatial scale of
   re-distribution exceeding several km in some species. At the same time
   the granulometric sediment composition changed, indicating changes of
   habitat quality. Hence, sampling of a large area, with random selection
   of the sampling sites on each sampling date, is suggested to yield the
   most reliable estimates of population development in the coastal North
   Sea. However, in view of the expected spatial scale of re-distribution
   during storm tides and the spatial variability of recruitment, even a
   180-km(2) sampling area may be too small. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Samples taken regularly from the intake screens of West Thurrock power
   station between January 1977 and November 1992 were used to investigate
   the factors controlling flatfish abundance (flounder: Platichthys
   flesus; dab: Limanda limanda; plaice: Pleuronectes platessa; sole: Solen
   solea) in the middle Thames estuary. Most sampled fish were age-0, All
   species followed regular patterns of seasonal occurrence, had
   distinctive seasonal abundance peaks and demonstrated only minimal
   temporal overlap. Multiple-regression models were used to study the
   relationship between physico-chemical variables: physico-chemical
   variable interactions, trends and seasonal factors on fluctuations in
   flatfish sample abundance. Flounder abundance was significantly
   influenced by temperature, suspended solids, oxygen-flow and
   oxygen-temperature interactions, trend and seasonal variables. Dab
   abundance was significantly related to suspended solids, oxygen-Bow,
   oxygen-temperature and How-chlorinity interactions, Crangon crangon
   abundance and seasonal variables. Sole abundance was controlled only by
   seasonal variables, whilst plaice abundance could not be adequately
   explained by the available physico-chemical data. The combination of
   variables affecting flatfish abundance indicates species using the
   estuary were affected by a complex set of events within the estuary, The
   interactions between routinely measured environmental variables further
   suggest that estuarine monitoring studies must attempt to understand the
   nature of possible interactions between variables if an improved
   understanding of the changes in estuarine fish communities resulting
   from human activity is to be gained. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Reproductive phenology of 117 individuals from a total of 20 ginger
   species (Costaceae and Zingiberaceae) was monitored for up to 21 mo in a
   lowland mixed dipterocarp forest in the Lambir Hills National Park,
   Sarawak. Of these 20 species of iteroparous perennials, pollinated by
   either spiderhunters (Nectariniidae), medium-sized Amegilla bees
   (Anthophoridae), or small halictid bees (Halictidae), many reproduced
   more than once a year, or flowered continuously with short
   interruptions. Significant hut weak synchronization in flowering events
   among conspecific individuals was detected for only two species out of
   the five examined (Etlingera aff. metriocheilos and Amomum
   somniculosum). The low synchronization within the population, the
   overlapping flowering among species sharing common pollinators, and the
   high flowering frequency for each species, contrast markedly with the
   reproductive phenology of hummingbird-pollinated and large
   bee-pollinated plants of related tars in the Neotropics. Although the
   plants studied do not include all members of each pollination guild, at
   least one species within a guild was flowering at any time except in the
   spiderhunter-pollinated guild. Some bee-pollinated gingers may serve as
   keystone species for survival of the traplining bees living on floral
   nectar and pollen.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue biomass (ash-free dry weight) and symbiotic dinoflagellates
   (density, chlorophyll a cell(-1) or cm(-2) of coral surface area) of
   five species of reef-building corals were monitored seasonally for up to
   4 yr at three different depths in the Bahamas. The lowest values of all
   tissue biomass and algal symbiont parameters occurred during the late
   summer-fall sample periods. In contrast, the highest densities and
   pigment content of symbionts usually occurred during the winter, whereas
   tissue biomass peaked most often in the spring, the time lag implying a
   functional relationship between these variables. Corals living in
   shallow water often (but not always) had higher levels of all parameters
   measured compared to deeper corals, except chlorophyll a content, which
   usually displayed the opposite trend. The results show that corals from
   all depths exhibited bleaching (loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and/or
   their pigments) every year, regardless of whether they appeared white,
   tan, or mottled to the human eye. We speculate that these patterns are
   driven by seasonal changes in light and temperature on algal and animal
   physiology. Furthermore, we hypothesize that all tropical reef-building
   corals, world-wide, exhibit similar predictable cycles in their tissue
   biomass and symbiotic algae.}},

Abstract = {{The European fanworm Sabella spallanzanii (Gmelin, 1791) was recently
   introduced to Port Phillip Bay and is now a conspicuous component of
   most benthic communities. Reproduction of the worm was investigated in a
   population at Queenscliff over a 2 yr period (October 1995 to October
   1997) using gonadal histology. The worms are dioecious (sex ratio 1:1, n
   = 250), and attained sexual maturity at similar to 50 mm body length.
   Reproductive periodicity followed a distinct annual cycle, and spawning
   proceeded through an extended autumn/winter period. Spawning was broadly
   synchronous between sexes, and coincided with falling seawater
   temperatures and shorter day-lengths. The females were highly fecund,
   and >50 000 eggs were probably shed from large females (>300 mm body
   length) during the annual spawning period. Breeding cycles of S.
   spallanzanii in Port Phillip Bay are similar to 6 mo out of phase with
   endemic populations located at similar latitudes in the northern
   hemisphere. The spread of S. spallanzanii within Port Phillip Bay has
   been monitored by divers on an annual basis since 1994. The most recent
   dive survey (1998) indicates that S. spallanzanii has extended its range
   through out the entire 2000 km(2) embayment, and has invaded most
   subtidal habitats. Quantitative estimates of S. spallanzanii abundances
   were highest on pier pylons (12.5 individuals m(-2), 0.5 to 7 m depths).
   On sediments, estimates were highest at shallow sites (0.3 m(-2), 7 m
   depth), but numbers declined significantly with depth (0.1 m(-2), 17 to
   22 m depth). Mean worm lengths and biomass were, by contrast,
   significantly higher at intermediate depths (12 to 17 m) than in
   shallower (7 m) or deeper (22 m) locations. S. spallanzanii demonstrates
   a clear preference for growth in sheltered, nutrient-enriched waters, so
   it may not spread from Port Phillip Bay into the adjacent oceanic waters
   of Bass Strait; however, in view of S. spallanzanii's current high
   abundance, fecundity and extended spawning periodicity, there is a high
   risk of future range expansions, mediated by shipping, into other
   temperate-water ports.}},

Abstract = {{A method to study bacterioplankton community structure in Antarctic
   freshwater lake samples is described. Small samples (between 300 and
   1000 ml) taken in remote field locations were used for crude DNA
   extraction, followed by PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments
   using group-specific primers. The amplification products of the PCR
   reaction were then separated using denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis to produce a profile of the bacterioplankton community.
   Whilst the technique is only semi-quantitative, it readily
   differentiated communities from lakes of different trophic status and
   from vertical profiles within different lake types. The method offers a
   sensitive tool for screening and monitoring Antarctic freshwater
   environments as a precursor and adjunct to more detailed studies.}},

Abstract = {{During recent decades, drought and anthropogenic influences have led to
   the diminishment of Lake Chad with adverse effects on both food and
   water resources. The local population has learned to adapt to the
   reduced seasonal inundation of the lake basin but are vulnerable to both
   droughts and excessive inflows. Here synergistic satellite radar
   altimetry and near-infrared imagery are employed to gain knowledge of
   the current flooding patterns. Variations in surface level for the
   inflowing rivers and the permanent and seasonal lake waters are derived
   for the 1990s using data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite. National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution
   Radiometer images provide additional variations of basin inundation from
   1995 to 1998, using a simple pixel histogram technique. With accuracy
   greater than or equal to 10cm rms, the altimetry reveals seasonal
   water-level variations of the order 0.5-6 m and there is a notable rise
   in minimum levels, 15-35 cm year(-1) within the lake basin. Peak-level
   phase lags of 4 to 5 months are also observed between the headwaters of
   the Chari/Logone rivers and the western lake marshes. Image results
   reveal that the permanent lake area is similar to 1.385 km(2), and that
   with an accuracy of similar to 5\% the surrounding regions have been
   additionally flooding by up to similar to 3,600 km(2) year (-1). Despite
   current basin complexities, the synergistic area/level measurements
   corroborate the know hydraulic relationship at low water levels. Both
   measurement sets reflect the poor inundation years of 1993/1994 and
   1997/1998, despite the indication of a general recovery in regional
   precipitation, inundation extent, and surface water level offers these
   remote sensing techniques as an additional tool for flood/drought
   forecasting and the availability of future fast delivery data, a
   mechanism for near-real time monitoring. (C) Elsevier Science Inc.,

Abstract = {{We sampled juvenile Snake River chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha
   to genetically characterize the endangered Snake River fall-run
   population. Juveniles from fall and spring-summer lineages coexisted in
   our sampling areas but were differentiated by large allozyme allele
   frequency differences. We sorted juveniles by multilocus genotypes into
   putative fall and spring lineage subsamples and determined lineage
   composition using maximum likelihood estimation methods. Paired
   sMEP-1{*} and PGK-2{*} genotypes-encoding malic enzyme (NADP(+)) and
   phosphoglycerate kinase, respectively-were very effective for sorting
   juveniles by lineage, and subsamples estimated to be 100\% fall lineage
   were obtained in four annual samples. We examined genetic relationships
   of these fall lineage juveniles with adjacent populations from the
   Columbia River and from Lyons Ferry Hatchery, which was established to
   perpetuate the Snake River fall-run population. Our samples of naturally
   produced Snake River fall lineage juveniles were most closely aligned
   with Lyons Ferry Hatchery samples. Although fall-run strays of Columbia
   River hatchery origin found on spawning grounds threaten the genetic
   integrity of the Snake River population, juvenile samples (a) showed
   distinctive patterns of allelic diversity, (b) were differentiated from
   Columbia River populations, and (c) substantiate earlier conclusions
   that this population is an important genetic resource. This first
   characterization of naturally produced Snake River fall chinook salmon
   provides a baseline for monitoring and recovery planning.}},

Abstract = {{Information about spawning migration and spawning habitat is essential
   to maintain and ultimately restore populations of endangered and
   threatened species of anadromous fish. We used ultrasonic and
   radiotelemetry to monitor the movements of 35 adult Gulf sturgeon
   Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi (a subspecies of the Atlantic sturgeon A.
   oxyrinchus) as they moved between Choctawhatchee Bay and the
   Choctawhatchee River system during the spring of 1996 and 1997.
   Histological analysis of gonadal biopsies was used to determine the sex
   and reproductive status of individuals. Telemetry results and egg
   sampling were used to identify Gulf sturgeon spawning sites and to
   examine the roles that sex and reproductive status play in migratory
   behavior Fertilized Gulf sturgeon eggs were collected in six locations
   in both the upper Choctawhatchee and Pea rivers. Hard bottom substrate,
   steep banks, and relatively high flows characterized collection sites.
   Ripe Gulf sturgeon occupied these spawning areas from late March through
   early May, which included the interval when Gulf sturgeon eggs were
   collected. For both sexes, ripe fish entered the Choctawhatchee River
   significantly earlier and at a lower water temperature and migrated
   further upstream than did nonripe fish. Males entered the Choctawhatchee
   River at a lower water temperature than females. Results from histology
   and telemetry support the hypothesis that male Gulf sturgeon may spawn
   annually, whereas females require more than 1 year between spawning
   events. Upper river hard bottom areas appear important for the
   successful spawning of Gulf sturgeon, and care should be taken to
   protect against habitat: loss or degradation of known spawning habitat.}},

Abstract = {{If decision-aid software models of weed emergence and growth are ever to
   help producers better time weed management, these models must be able to
   predict perennial weed shoot emergence from vegetative propagules. In
   this research, Cirsium arvense shoot emergence from adventitious root
   buds in spring was modeled using degree-day heat sums. Fractional C.
   arvense shoot emergence was best modeled as a logistic dose-response
   function of degree-day heat sum as follows: Y = 1.108/(1 + {[}X/
   488.344](-5.161)) where Y = fractional C. arvense shoot emergence (0 to
   1) and X = heat sum in degree-days above 0 C after day 91 of the year
   (April 1) with an upper limit of 800 degree (C) days (r(2) = 0.83). This
   empirical model was validated by graphing observed vs. model-predicted
   C. arvense shoot emergence using two independently gathered data sea,
   one of C. arvense emergence in autumn chisel-plowed Triticum aestivum
   (r(2) = 0.82) and the other in no-till fallow (r(2) = 0.63). The model
   slightly overestimated emergence at low fractional emergence (< similar
   to 7\% at 0.1 fractional emergence) and underestimated emergence at high
   fractional emergence (10 to 20\% at 0.8 to 1.0 fractional emergence).
   Below an emergence fraction of 0.8, the model adequately estimated
   observed emergence to within about 10\% of the predicted regression
   line. Using the model, about 1\% and 80\% of C. arvense shoots should
   emerge from adventitious root buds after a heat sum accumulates of about
   197 and 587 C d, respectively, starting from day 91 of the year.
   Consequently, farmers should begin monitoring C. arvense patches for
   emergence and height growth after about 197 C d accumulate and expect to
   control C. arvense before about 587 C d accumulate, which is when about
   80\% of shoots have emerged.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of salinity on hatching, larval survival and infectivity of
   Anguillicola crassus was studied under experimental conditions using
   eggs obtained from naturally infected eels. Egg hatching rate.
   second-stage larval survival and larval infectivity were maximal in
   fresh water and declined with increase in salinity. Larvae survived up
   to 100 d in fresh water, 70 d in 50\% sea water and 40 d in 100\% sea
   water. Infectivity experiments demonstrated that salinity influenced
   transmission success throughout the Life cycle by decreasing total
   infectivity of the larval population in utero within female A. crassus
   and when larvae were free-living in the aquatic environment. Infectivity
   was age-dependent in relation to salinity. Larvae were infective to
   intermediate and paratenic hosts for up to 80 d in fresh water, 21 d in
   50\% sea water and up to 8 d in 100\% sea water. The data confirm field
   observations that infection levels decrease with an increase in
   salinity. The study contributes to experimental verification of the
   colonization abilities of A. crassus and supports the hypothesis that A.
   crassus can be disseminated and transmitted in brackish water. The
   importance of regular monitoring and stringent hygiene practices in the
   transportation of eels is emphasised.}},

Abstract = {{Vieux-Pre' is an artificial reservoir in the north-east part of France
   (61 Mm(3)), created in 1986 for hydraulic management. The phytoplankton
   and several environmental parameters in the upper part of the lake were
   monitored at a mid-lake station, from 1988 to 1997. The specific
   composition of the community changed during this period, from a
   predominantly pennate-diatom phytoplankton (Asterionella formosa,
   Fragilaria crotonensis), the lake passed to dominance by a sparse,
   motile nanoplankton (Mallomonas akrokomos, M. caudata, Cryptomonas
   erosa, Chroomonas/Rhodomonas, a.o.) and then by large colonies of
   small-celled species (Uroglena americana, Dinobryon spp., Radiocystis
   geminata, Aphanothece clathrata, Coelosphaerium kuetzingianum a.o.).
   This paper describes the algal successions involved and shows the
   decisive effects of the decrease of trophic level from an eutrophic
   stage to an oligo-mesotrophic condition. In the beginning, externally
   imposed disturbances (flooding and dewatering) were frequent, while now
   the lake has stabilised as a deep, stratified pelagic system. Under
   these conditions, autogenic phytoplankton appear to dominate.}},

Abstract = {{The Russian wheat aphid (=RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Kurdj.) is an exotic
   expansive aphid on the small grains determined in the Czech republic
   since 1993 (1995). Determination of RWA flight patterns by suction air
   traps (=SATs) between 1994-1998 indicated some banker, less important,
   or indicated RWA distribution areas. A comparison of the RWA monitoring
   by SATs and by crop samples in areas more or less distant from
   individual SAT locations manifested a high similarity of RWA evidence in
   its overall distribution and area-influenced population numbers. Owing
   to geographic area-dependent features of its life-cycle (holocycly) and
   host plant preferences, RWA seems to be most injurious to spring barley.
   In spite of the role of SATs in aphid forecasting, RWA samples are
   recommended to be taken also from the crops at the early ripening stage
   as the respective SAT evidence reflects only the emigration of the alate
   aphids originating from the decreasing populations. In general, RWA
   detection by SATs was either simultaneously or successively found to
   reflect the RWA presence in the more or less distant crops. The 30 km
   perimeter of a SAT is agreed to be representative for monitoring RWA
   populations in a sampled area.}},

Abstract = {{Egg densities were monitored in the dry sediment of four desert rock
   pool populations of the fairy shrimp Branchipodopsis wolfi over
   different years/seasons. Egg densities varied according to pool and
   season/year between about 1,000 and 220,000 eggs per m(2). This converts
   to population sizes of between about 200 and 500,000 viable diapausing
   eggs per pool. Egg densities are within the range of 10(3) to 10(5) eggs
   per m(2) usually measured for other zooplankton species with egg banks.
   Egg densities were associated but not significantly correlated with
   chances for successful recruitment in each of the pools as estimated
   from direct observations of pool hydrocycles and from pool morphometry.
   Egg bank densities were also not significantly linked with maturation
   rate and average brood size of the respective populations. Egg densities
   fluctuate in a partially asynchronosus way among the pools suggesting
   that factors other than chances for recruitment are also important in
   controlling egg bank dynamics. The large variance (CV greater than or
   equal to 80 \%) in egg densities over the seasons in unvegetated pools
   with loose and sparse sediment in comparison with vegetated pools (CV
   <40 \%) with compact sediment holding the eggs, is suggestive of the
   overriding importance of stochastic passive dispersal by wind or
   overflows. Earlier reproduction and larger average broods in the
   short-lived pools also weaken a positive correlation between habitat
   suitability and egg bank density. The relatively high egg densities of
   B. wolfi egg banks illustrate the effectiveness of the reproductive and
   hatching characteristics of this species to successfully persist in this
   extreme type of temporary habitat. This is the first study on egg bank
   dynamics in large branchiopods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents data from a twelve-year (1986-98) monitoring of
   waterbird populations at Muni Lagoon, and discusses the ornithological
   importance of the lagoon and trends in the use of the site by
   waterbirds. The small brackish lagoon forms part of the Muni-Pomadze
   Ramsar site situated on the Ghana coast. A total of 48 species of
   waterbirds were recorded at the site comprising of 29 species of waders,
   eight species of terns, two species of gulls, seven species of herons
   and egrets, one species each of duck and cormorant. The most abundant
   waterbirds species recorded on the site were the Curlew Sandpiper,
   Ringed Plover, Greenshank, Black-winged Stilt, Common Tern, Black Tern,
   Royal Tern and the Sandwich Tern. Three species of waders, Black-winged
   Stilt, Pratincole and Little Tern were observed to breed at the site.
   The highest numbers of waterbirds occurred on the site in the period
   September to March. The site remains an internationally important
   wetland site by virtue of supporting internationally important numbers
   of four species of terns: Royal Tern, Sandwich Tern, Common Tern and
   Black Tern. The value of Muni lies more in its use as a feeding/staging
   site for migrating waders that spend the non-breeding season in Ghana or
   pass through to winter further south, and as a roosting site for terns
   which feed mainly at sea. The use of the site by waterbirds has
   increased by some 400\% between 1986 and 1998. This is attributed to
   improved prey availability resulting from the opening of the lagoon into
   the sea during the 1994 floods, and reduced disturbance of feeding and
   roosting birds. This would imply that the value of the site as waterbird
   habitat could improve considerably with appropriate habitat management
   interventions and continued protection.}},

Abstract = {{The endemic Barau's petrel (Pterodroma baraui) is restricted to the
   island of La Ri union in the Mascarene archipelago where it breeds on
   the upper slopes of the highest mountains in areas that are virtually
   inaccessible to humans. Although the species is considered to be
   critically endangered, little is known about its biology and the actual
   threats for Barau's petrel on its breeding grounds have never been
   investigated, In this paper we report data that were collected during
   the first ever visit of a Barau's petrel colony. The species breeds
   underground in upland elfin forests between 2400 and 2700 m above sea
   level. A thick, undisturbed, humus layer appears to be a prerequisite to
   burrow establishment, which implies that the species may be especially
   susceptible to trampling by humans or other large vertebrates. We found
   evidence of past exploitation of Barau's petrel by humans. In addition,
   the colony is inhabited by three, possibly four, species of introduced
   commensals, including Rattus sp., which imposes predation on eggs and
   chicks and may affect the breeding success. We stress the need to
   establish control campaigns to eradicate potential predators from the
   nesting colonies and long-term monitoring projects for the Barau's
   petrel before it undergoes irreversible population decline. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A wide translocation program was conducted on neotropical fauna in
   French Guiana during the filling of a hydroelectric reservoir. Red
   howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) were studied because available data
   on their behavior in undisturbed conditions provided the basis for
   behavioral comparison with translocated animals. A resident howler
   population was present in the selected release area, but population
   densities were severely reduced by previous strong hunting pressure. A
   post-release survey was conducted during 18 months using radio-tracking
   and visual observations of 16 females. Most radio-tagged females settled
   in a stable home range. All but one of the released troops split up but
   all the monitored females were thereafter re-observed with resident
   congeners, sometimes after a period of solitary living. Most of the
   behavioral characteristics of the translocated individuals corresponded
   to previous observations on undisturbed animals. It is concluded that
   the behavioral abilities of this species helped them to survive and
   settle in a new area. Population reinforcements or re-introduction of
   red howlers may therefore be conducted with a good probability of
   success. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Females of Callosobruchus spp. are known to produce sex pheromones that
   attract males. These sex pheromones cannot be adopted for use in pest
   management without first investigating the responses of the males in the
   windless conditions of storage environments. Consequently, behavioural
   bioassays of Callosobruchus subinnotatus Pic males were conducted in an
   olfactometer in the absence of air-flow. Under these conditions males
   were found to be able to follow odour trails to the source. However, the
   latency period was longer in diffusional bioassays than for insects in a
   Y-tube olfactometer that provided directional wind cues. The highest
   percentage of males reached the pheromone source when components of the
   pheromones, (E)-3-methyl-2-heptenoic acid (E32A) and
   (Z)-3-methyl-2-heptenoic acid (Z32A), were formulated in a 50:50 or
   25:75 ratio. Males of C. maculatus (Fabricius) responded to sex
   pheromone of C. subinnotatus, but males of C. subinnotatus did not
   respond to that of C. maculatus. The two sex pheromone components of C.
   subinnotatus are also constituents of C. maculatus sex pheromone. These
   two components may be potentially useful in monitoring the populations
   of both species in stored beans. It is postulated that
   (Z)-3-methyl-3-heptenoic acid (Z33A), the major component of the sex
   pheromone of C. maculatus, must have acted as an antagonist inhibiting
   response of C. subinnotatus to the sex pheromone of C. maculatus.}},

Abstract = {{To determine whether a highly disturbed peatland ecosystem was
   successfully regenerating, we monitored the natural revegetation of a
   vacuum-mined bog located in southern Quebec that was abandoned in 1989
   (Cacouna bog). Vegetation surveys were carried out in 1994 and 1998. The
   presence/absence of all species of vascular and non-vascular plants
   along eight 264-m long transects was noted in both years. The height
   structure of the invading birch (Betula spp.) population was also
   reconstructed in 1998. Only 11 plant species were sampled in 1994 at the
   vacuum-mined site. The 1998 survey added only five other species to the
   list. Nevertheless, the 1994 and 1998 vegetation surveys were
   significantly different, particularly because the cover of four
   ericaceous shrub species (Chamaedaphne calyculata, Kalmia! angustifolia,
   Ledum groenlandicum, Vaccinium angustifolium) had ir;creased since 1994.
   Height structure of the birch population indicated that seedlings were
   very numerous at the study site, but few of them will probably survive
   to their first or second growing season. This suggests that the natural
   revegetation of the Cacouna bog's vacuum-mined (mechanically harvested)
   site is slowly converging towards that of most block-cut mined (manually
   harvested) sites in southern Quebec; i.e., a dense plant cover dominated
   by ericaceous shrub species. However, no Sphagnum species had
   established eight years after abandonment of the vacuum-mined section.
   This indicates that the site is not returning to a functional peatland
   ecosystem. Additional restoration measures should be elaborated to
   accelerate the revegetation process.}},

Abstract = {{We examined annual changes in relative abundance of Lake Michigan fishes
   using linear models with correlated errors in space and time. Abundance
   of bloater (Coregonus hoyi), deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus
   thompsoni), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), alewife (Alosa
   pseudoharengus), and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) was monitored with
   bottom trawls at 10 discrete depths (between 18 and 110 m) off eight
   fixed ports from 1973 to 1992. The model describing abundance included
   fixed effects of year, port, depth, and interaction terms as well as
   quadratic and cubic effects of year and depth because changes in
   abundance were not strictly linear. Observed temporal trends in
   abundance varied with species and depth. Additionally, trends in alewife
   and slimy sculpin abundances depended on port. Cubic trends in the
   abundance of bloater and quadratic trends in deepwater sculpin and
   rainbow smelt abundances were similar among ports, permitting lakewide
   inferences for these species. Mean bloater abundance was low throughout
   the 1970s, increased during the 1980s, and reached high levels by 1990.
   Mean abundances of deepwater sculpin and rainbow smelt increased from
   1973 to the mid-1980s and declined thereafter. The linear model with
   correlated errors can be readily applied to repeated-measures data from
   other fixed-station fishery surveys and is appropriate for data
   exhibiting spatial and temporal autocorrelations.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for monitoring temporal changes in population size vary from
   intensive and potentially expensive to less intensive and more easily
   implemented techniques. In this paper we evaluate the utility of a
   monitoring technique that can be used to follow many vertebrate species
   simultaneously at low cost and requires little training of personnel.
   Observers record the number of individuals seen per hour in the field
   and these rates of encounter are used as an index of population size. We
   examine whether encounter rates reflect population size by comparing
   them with independent censuses of three species over a 7-year period in
   the boreal forest near Kluane Lake in the southern Yukon Territory.
   Encounter rates were generally an accurate reflection of variation in
   population size. In our study system, inter-observer variability did not
   influence our ability to detect fluctuations in population size: the
   underlying fluctuations were detected whether data from all or only a
   group of ``high-quality{''} observers were used. In our study, the
   benefit of using all available data outweighed the cost of variation
   among observers because sample sizes were large (averaging over 1200
   data points from 33 observers per year). Variation in the length of
   observation periods did not affect the chance of detecting animals in
   our study. Encounter rates provide a reasonable index of variation in
   population size, although caution should be used with species that are
   uncommon or difficult to detect.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroductions are often used for reestablishment of animal
   populations. The choice of age-class of released individuals, however,
   is often arbitrary or based on expediency. We developed a demographic
   model that predicts the relative efficiency of releasing juveniles or
   adults for a given life cycle. The model accounts for possible reduction
   of survival and fertility of released adults. It also incorporates
   demographic and environmental stochasticity to compare release
   strategies of varying duration and number of releases. We applied the
   model to the case of reintroduction of Griffon Vultures (Gyps fulvus) in
   southern France, for which accurate monitoring allowed us to estimate
   demographic rates and consequences of releases. Overall, for Griffon
   Vultures, it is more efficient to release adults than juveniles, despite
   the observed reduction of demographic parameters following release. This
   approach could be used for the reintroduction of other species.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the demographic consequences of road mortality in the
   cooperatively breeding Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), a
   threatened species restricted to the oak scrub of peninsular Florida.
   Between May 1986 and July 1995 we monitored the survival and
   reproductive success of a color-banded population of jays along a
   two-lane highway at Archbold Biological Station. Annual mortality of
   breeding adults was 0.38 on road territories, significantly higher than
   the rate of 0.23 for breeders on nonroad territories. High mortality on
   road territories appeared to be a direct result of automobile traffic
   per se and not a consequence of road-induced changes in habitat
   characteristics. Mortality was especially high for immigrants without
   previous experience living along the road: in their first two years as
   breeders on road territories, naive immigrants experienced annual
   mortality of 0.50 and 0.45. From year 3 onward, however, annual
   mortality dropped to 0.29, not significantly different from the rate for
   birds on nonroad territories. This experience-dependent decline in road
   mortality could be caused either by surviving jays learning to avoid
   automobiles or by selective mortality operating through time
   (demographic heterogeneity). Proximity to the road had no effect on
   nesting success beyond its indirect effects on breeder experience and
   group size. Because the mortality of 30- to 90-day-old fledglings was
   significantly higher on road territories than on nonroad territories,
   however, breeder mortality greatly exceeded production of yearlings on
   road territories. Roadside territories therefore are sinks that can
   maintain populations of Florida Scrub-Jays only via immigration. Because
   Florida Scrub-Jays do not avoid roadside habitats and may even be
   attracted to them, road mortality presents a difficult challenge for the
   management and conservation of this threatened and declining species.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological indicators for long-term monitoring programs are needed to
   detect and assess changing environmental conditions. We developed and
   tested community-level environmental indicators for monitoring forest
   bird populations and associated habitat. We surveyed 197 sampling plots
   in loblolly-shortleaf pine forests, spanning an area from Georgia to
   Virginia (U.S.A.) and representing a gradient in levels of anthropogenic
   disturbance. Ninety of these plots were randomly selected from a
   sampling grid, permitting quantitative assessment of cumulative
   distribution functions for bird community and habitat parameters.
   Species were independently classified into habitat assemblages
   indicating birds typical of disturbed habitat (e.g., shrubland, forest
   edge) and undisturbed habitat (mature forest). Relative abundances of
   these assemblages were used to form a bird community index-similar to
   the index of biotic integrity applied to aquatic systems-showing the
   effects of habitat disturbance on forest bird communities. Bird
   communities on the majority of the sample area (52-75\%, 90\% confidence
   interval) were dominated by disturbance-tolerant species. Sites
   dominated by mature-forest species were comparatively uncommon. Habitat
   assemblages appeared to be particularly useful tools for environmental
   monitoring; individual species abundance was positively correlated with
   assemblage species richness, and assemblage members showed consistent
   responses to variations in disturbance level. To a lesser extent,
   component species of nesting guilds showed this pattern of cohesive
   responses, but those of foraging guilds did not. We also developed a
   habitat index based on habitat variables that predicted bird community
   index values. Habitat and bird community indices were strongly
   correlated in an independent validation dataset, suggesting that the
   habitat index can provide a reliable predictor of bird community status.
   The two indices may be used in combination, with the bird community
   index providing a direct measure of the status of the bird community and
   the habitat index providing a basis on which to separate changes in the
   bird community into local habitat effects versus other factors (e.g.,
   landscape level effects, changes on wintering grounds).}},

Abstract = {{We used mark-recapture techniques to estimate the attraction sampling
   area of baited traps for monitoring density of the crayfish Procambarus
   alleni in the freshwater marshes of the Florida Everglades. We
   successfully applied a permanent visible tag suitable for mass or
   individual marking of crayfish. In laboratory mesocosms, males and
   females and juveniles and adults entered baited wire traps with similar
   frequency, reflecting a lack of age- or sex-specific bias in trapping.
   In flooded marsh habitat, we released marked crayfish among a circular
   array of baited traps set at a specific radial distance from the release
   point and determined recapture proportions over 48 h. We then used the
   methodology of Turchin \& Odenaal (1996) to estimate the effective
   sampling area based on the proportions of crayfish recaptured over
   various radial distances. In flooded marshes, the mean proportion of
   recaptures declined from 0.59 in traps with a 1-m sampling radius to
   0.02 in traps with a 28-m sampling radius. A log-linear regression model
   provided the best fit to the capture data, and the effective sampling
   area of baited traps was estimated as 56.3 m(2). The effective sampling
   area serves as a translation coefficient that can be used to calculate
   actual density of crayfish in a given area from mark-recapture trapping
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of predator removal or protection on the reproductive success
   and density of grouse populations was studied experimentally in southern
   and northern Finland. In predator removal areas small and medium-sized
   carnivores were efficiently hunted, while in predator protection areas
   hunting was prohibited. Both predator (red fox, raccoon dog, pine marten
   and stoat) and grouse populations were monitored. The breeding success
   of grouse, indicated by the young/adults ratio, decreased in the
   predator protection area in northern Finland during a vole low. Despite
   a decline in the vole population, the breeding success of grouse did not
   decline in the predator removal area. The mean brood size during the
   experiment was significantly higher in the removal areas than in the
   protection areas both in southern and northern Finland. Predator
   removal/protection thus affected the reproductive success of grouse, but
   the impact of control on adult grouse populations was not as evident.}},

Abstract = {{Lone-term growth and survivorship of individual arboreal nests were
   studied in three species of Neotropical termites in the genus
   Nasutitermes. Of the 29 N. corniger (Motschulsky) and seven N. ephratae
   (Holmgren) nests monitored in an area of young second-growth in Panama,
   12 (41\%) N. corniger and four (57\%) N. ephratae nests remained active
   throughout the 9- to 11-mo study. There was no significant difference in
   survivorship between small and large nests of either species. In
   surviving N. corniger nests with a single queen, the net increase in
   volume was highly correlated (r = 0.87, n = 9) with queen wet weight.
   There was a marked seasonality to nest expansion in both. N. corniger
   and N. ephratae, with growth occurring almost exclusively during the wet
   season. Seventeen N. acajutlae (Holmgren) nests were monitored for 4-9
   yr on Guana Island, British Virgin Islands. Four of the 17 (23.5\%) N.
   acajutlae nests survived the study period, and two more abandoned their
   original nest and relocated. Within this limited sample of colonies, N.
   acajutlae nests that were large ( >150,000 cm(3)) at the beginning of
   the study had a higher probability of survival than did small ( <100.000
   cm(3)) nests. Nest budding, relocation, and resprouting are mechanisms
   that Nasutitermes may use to create a new nest for all or a portion of
   an established colony. The ontogeny of incipient Nasutitermes colonies
   is discussed as a sequence in which a young colony remains cryptic
   within wood, building its population size to a point where the colony
   can maintain and defend a nest. Early in a wet season, termites then
   venture from within wood to build and occupy a small arboreal nest.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper describes the fishery of the Ea Kao reservoir in south
   Vietnam. Historical data on the total production and total numbers of
   fish stocked were available from 1983 to 1996, and this information,
   together with the results of monthly monitoring of the fishery from June
   1996 to December 1998, was used in the present study. A number of gears
   are used in the Ea Kao fishery, the most important being gill, lift and
   integrated nets, and beach seines. The fishery of Ea Kao is based on the
   annual stocking of advanced fry/early fingerlings of 0.3-1.0-g bighead
   carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson), silver carp,
   Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Cuvier \& Valenciennes) and rohu, Labeo
   rohita Hamilton, as well as the self-recruiting indigenous species
   Toxabramis houdemeri Pellegrin and two exotic species, i.e. Nile
   tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), and common carp, Cyprinus carpio L.
   On average, the regularly stocked species contribute to 78\% of total
   production, which has been around 400-450 kg ha(-1) in the last few
   years. The monthly peak catches of stocked species tend to coincide with
   the rainy season from May to October and the catches of self-recruiting
   species peak between February and April. A significant relationship (P <
   0.001) exists between the stocking density in year n (SD, n ha(-1)) and
   the yield of stocked fish in year n + 1 (Y, kg ha(-1)):
   Y = -0.0006SD(2) + 0.097SD-45.50 (r(2) = 0.85, P < 0.001)
   Stocking efficiency (SE, based on number stocked per hectare versus
   yield of stocked species, i.e. n ha(-1) versus kg ha(-1)) was computed
   for all stocked species combined because the landings prior to 1997 did
   not distinguish between bighead carp, silver carp and rohu. The
   relationship between SE in year n + 1 to SD in year n was:
   Y = 0.05SD(2) + 0.07SD + 60.49 (r(2) = 0.33, P < 0.05).}},

Abstract = {{The web-spinning sawfly Cephalcia arvensis is a defoliator of the Norway
   spruce (Picea abies) in Northern Eurasia. Four outbreaks have been
   recorded in the last 15 years in Czech Republic and in Italy. A
   comparative analysis of the involved populations revealed noticeable
   differences in phenology, leading to a strong variation in life cycle
   and voltinism. A population already known as `spring form' for the early
   emergence of adults, and morphologically distinguishable at the prepupal
   stage, has been found to be genetically different from populations
   emerging later, as far as allozymes and chromosomes are concerned. The
   high biological and genetic variability observed among populations of C.
   arvensis allows these sawflies to become adapted to a wide range of
   local conditions, contributing in this way to the differentiation of
   local races and species. In spite of this variability, all the outbreaks
   occurred in Norway spruce plantations characterized by about the same
   silvicultural parameters (50-to-100-year-old, high density and medium to
   high quality), located outside or on the border of the natural range of
   the host plant, and thus undergoing various environmental stresses. As
   the silvicultural conditions of the stressed stands may determine the
   risk of outbreak, the integration of cultural methods (selection of
   planting areas and of regeneration material, selective cutting of mature
   stands to increase diversity) in pest management seems to be very
   important. The management of the pest would also benefit from extending
   monitoring to cover all the phenological variants, because an early
   detection of the outbreak is essential for a successful application of
   the biocontrol techniques presently available. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Although biomonitoring approaches are being increasingly used in the
   measurement of stream and river health, critical assumptions about the
   nature of biological populations and communities that underpin them are
   often ignored. Many approaches based on pattern detection in plant and
   animal communities assume high temporal persistence in the absence of
   anthropogenic disturbances. However, this has been rarely tested with
   long-term data sets and there is evidence that this assumption is not
   true in some river systems. Biological processes, such as predation and
   recruitment, can account for considerable spatial and temporal variation
   in the structure of some stream communities. These processes may prevent
   the development of robust predictive models or indices based on pattern
   detection. Measurements of population or community attributes also are
   often used to infer ecosystem processes, yet the link between pattern
   and process has rarely been demonstrated. Many goals of river management
   relate to the maintenance of natural ecological processes and ecosystem
   function; direct measurement of these processes is, however, often
   neglected in assessment programs. Such measures are often sensitive to
   causal factors that are known to affect river health and it is possible
   to develop simple but powerful predictive models. Perhaps more
   importantly, should an impact to be detected, strategies for remediation
   are more obvious as the causal processes are generally better known. The
   ultimate success of biomonitoring approaches depends on how well we
   understand the biophysical processes that influence the structure and
   dynamics of stream and river systems, and the way they function.}},

Abstract = {{Fish communities in large rivers are characterized by a high diversity,
   which reflects the structural diversity and habitat richness of inshore
   zones and connected floodplains. The connectivity of the different
   habitat elements in a broad spatio-temporal context, i.e., at various
   scales from catchment to microhabitat - and their nestedness - define
   the fitness of fish species both on the individual level (e.g., growth
   performances) and population level (i.e., population structure,
   mortality, etc.). Relevant spatial scales can be the whole river course
   in the case of some anadromous migrators or the availability of
   complementary microhabitat elements, e.g., during the early ontogeny of
   a species. The significance of connectivity at various scales from whole
   river to local reach have to be evaluated based on the requirements,
   reaction norms, and ecological flexibility of individual species.
   Integrity has to be evaluated in several respects:
   (1) with regard to population genetics over extensive biogeographic
   areas and in long time scales;
   (2) with regard to supplementary habitats in the course of the life
   cycle of individual species with ontogenetic habitat shifts and specific
   requirements during the reproductive phase;
   (3) with regard to longitudinal and lateral transport and exchange
   processes determining local habitat conditions and the food supply for
   fish.
   Due to these dependencies the status and condition of the fish fauna is
   a critical sensor of integrity at different scales and thus a good
   monitoring tool especially with regard to river engineering. The
   structure of the fish population - in particular the relative abundance
   of specifically adapted floodplain species - provides information on the
   overall conditions. For a more detailed evaluation the local
   distribution pattern of the fish fauna, population structure,
   seasonality, and growth performances of the early life history stages
   can indicate the quality and extent of connectedness at a finer scale
   and can be used to define management and engineering criteria.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a multi-level concept for fish-based assessment (MuLFA) of
   the ecological integrity of running waters. This concept is designed for
   large-scale monitoring programmes such as required for the proposed
   Water Framework Directive of the EU. Out of five different biological
   organisation levels (fauna, community, guild, population and
   individual), we propose seven criteria: River-type-specific species,
   species with self-sustaining populations, fish region, number of guilds,
   guild composition, population size and population age structure. The
   principle of the MuLFA is based on assessing the deviation from
   undisturbed reference conditions. Reference conditions have to be
   compiled for every distinct river type using historical fish and abiotic
   data, present river-type-specific reference sites and reference models.
   The final assessment procedure is done by comparing the assessment reach
   with the reference conditions using a 5-tiered normative scheme and
   assigning that reach to the level of highest coincidence. The benefit of
   the MuLFA is its potential for consistent sensitivity to low- and
   high-dose human alterations, and due to its general character, its
   adaptability to all river types.}},

Abstract = {{Plagues of rodents in field crops have been a problem of human societies
   for centuries. These problems diminished with the onset of effective
   herbicides and clean farming practices in the 1960s, but there has been
   a resurgence of rodent irruptions in cropfields since the advent of
   conservation tillage systems. We examined the efficacy of in-furrow
   applications of 2\% zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) pellets (27.5 kg ha(-1) {[}5
   lb acre(-1)]) at planting for the control of rodent damage in no-till
   corn. Three independent field studies were conducted in northeastern NE,
   southern IL, and southern IN. Vole populations in the most severely
   damaged fields (IL) ranged from 104 to 138 active colonies ha(-1). Zn3P2
   reduced yield loss in the three study areas by 7-34\%. Projected
   economic returns ranged from US\$1044 to US\$5360, based on
   representative 64-ha fields and a net profit of US\$250 ha(-1).
   Benefit:cost ratios ranged from 1.1 to 5.6:1 and were directly related
   to vole population levels. To prevent rodent damage in no-till
   cornfields, we recommend an integrated pest management approach that
   incorporates the use of a combination of the following techniques:
   rodent population monitoring, economic thresholds, mowing, early
   pre-plant herbicides, broadcast whole-kernel corn, and in-furrow
   applications of Zn3P2 pellets. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of dose and field longevity of lures treated with synthetic
   female yellow scale sex pheromone
   ((5E)-6-isopropyl-3,9-dimethyl-5,8-decadienyl acetate) were evaluated
   for monitoring flight activity of male yellow scale, Aonidiella citrina
   (Coquillett). Pheromone doses of 1-200 mu g per lure attracted large
   numbers of males. Lower doses (1-5 mu g per lure) generally attracted
   fewer males, but trap counts unequivocally showed the beginnings and
   peaks in male flight activity at both low and high population densities.
   Furthermore, the low-dose pheromone traps that collected fewer
   individuals were easier and less time-consuming to assess, and so the
   lower doses are recommended for monitoring phenology and population
   densities. In field longevity tests, pheromone lures continued to
   attract sufficient numbers of male scale to follow population trends for
   up to 4 months. Insecticide applications suppressed the number of male
   scale captured on pheromone cards, A 1989 pheromone trap survey of
   yellow scale in Tulare County, California demonstrated that yellow scale
   was distributed throughout the citrus growing region of that county, and
   was especially heavy in the area between Porterville and Terra Bella.}},

Title = {{Monitoring mammal populations with line transect techniques in African
   forests}},

Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{1. Line transect survey techniques have been used to estimate population
   density for a variety of mammal species in tropical forests. In many
   cases indirect methods, surveying signs of animals such as counts of
   dung or nests, have been used because of the poor visibility in these
   forests. The estimates of the production and decomposition rates of
   these signs each have their associated errors; however, for the majority
   of published studies these errors have not been incorporated into the
   estimate of the standard errors or confidence limits of the density
   estimate. An equation is given showing how this should be done.
   2. An equation is also given relating the resolution (R) of a density
   estimate to the coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimate. This
   shows that to detect a 10\% change in a population the CV must be 3.6\%
   (with a power of 50\%) or 2.4\% (with 80\% power). Using this equation
   and data from studies in Africa, it is shown that differences of less
   than 10-30\% change in the population are unlikely to be detected
   between two surveys where visual sightings of animals are made. When
   indirect methods of estimating the population are used, it is unlikely
   that less than a 30-50\% change in the population could be detected.
   3. Some studies have surveyed primate groups using estimates of an
   average group spread. Data from primate groups in Budongo Forest,
   Uganda, show that group spread is highly variable and varies at
   different times of day and between months. This survey technique is not
   recommended.
   4. If line transects are used for monitoring populations, conversion
   factors should be minimized as each contributes to an increase in the CV
   and a reduction in the ability to detect small changes in population
   density.
   5. Monitoring trends in abundance over several survey periods can
   improve the detection of change, although this is costly and requires
   several surveys before any conclusions can be reached. Re-using
   transects in subsequent surveys can also reduce the variation around the
   estimate and will improve the resolution. Focusing survey efforts in
   areas of high density is an alternative strategy, but one that could
   lead to other errors as high-density areas may be the safest and hence
   the last to show change. Using biased survey methods is also a promising
   technique that can increase the precision of surveys. It is concluded
   that a combination of different survey methods will ensure that changes
   in abundance are identified.}},

Abstract = {{1 Tree populations were monitored for six decades on a grid of 140
   permanent plots in old-growth mesic (hemlock-northern hardwood) forests
   in northern Michigan, USA. Multiple remeasurements allow assessment of
   stability of late-successional forests and analysis of spatial patterns
   and environmental linkages.
   2 This forest is not compositionally stable. Betula alleghaniensis has
   declined with little regeneration, suggesting dependence on episodic
   canopy disruption for persistence. Tsuga canadensis and Fagus
   grandifolia have increased in dominance in all size classes
   independently of major disturbances. Acer saccharum populations have
   remained little changed overall. Dynamics appear to be successional in
   nature, even though there has been no major disturbance for at least 400
   years. Different areas in the stand may have experienced different
   histories.
   3 Fagus grandifolia has invaded the stand recently through range
   expansion, and has come to dominate regeneration in some parts of the
   stand.
   4 Canonical correspondence analysis suggests that soil texture,
   chemistry, and drainage influence successional dynamics, producing
   strong spatial pattern. Fagus grandifolia has invaded only on relatively
   fine-textured soils with impeded drainage.
   5 Trends suggest that Fagus, Tsuga, and perhaps Acer saccharum would, in
   different parts of the stand, achieve near-total dominance in the
   absence of large-scale disturbance, but only after elapsed time of a
   millennium or more. Estimated return times for major disturbance in this
   region are of similar magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of crop rotation on populations of tuber nea beetle, Epitrix
   tuberis Gentner, in potatoes was investigated using data supplied by an
   integrated pest management (IPM) company and Geographic Information
   System software and conventional statistical methods. Using combined
   1995 and 1996 data, beetles of the overwintered and F(1) generations in
   both the interior and edges of potato fields showed a significant linear
   increase with an increase in the preceding consecutive years (0, 1, and
   2 years) that the current years' crop was planted to potatoes.
   Populations were significantly higher in nonrotated fields compared with
   rotated fields. Both the percentage of the cropping region requiring
   insecticidal control of tuber nea beetles and the cost of insecticides
   per hectare of potatoes grown increased linearly with an increase in the
   number of previous years planted to potatoes. Not practicing crop
   rotation resulted in a 4.2-7.3\% increase in the cropping region
   requiring insecticidal control of tuber flea beetles. The cost of
   controlling beetles in potato fields planted to potatoes for 3
   consecutive years was up to \$20/ha greater than potatoes rotated from
   the preceding year. Beetle counts from the interior of rotated potato
   fields never exceeded threshold levels when held edges also were below
   threshold. It is concluded that sampling of overwintered beetles in
   interior sites of rotated fields could be abandoned, and only 1
   monitoring scout rather than 2 would be necessary to monitor a field
   during this time. From these results, we concluded that rotating potato
   crops would reduce spray costs to the farmer and monitoring costs to LPM
   companies.}},

Title = {{Thermaikos Gulf Coastal System, NW Aegean Sea: an overview of
   water/sediment fluxes in relation to air-land-ocean interactions and
   human activities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an overview of the Holocene formation and evolution
   of the coastal system of Thermaikos Gulf (NW Aegean Sea). The system is
   divided into the terrestrial sub-system and the oceanic sub-system; the
   former represents 90\%, while the latter includes only 10\% of the total
   area. This particular coastal zone includes the second most important
   socio-economic area of Greece and in the southern Balkans, the
   Thessaloniki region; this is in terms of population concentration(> 1
   million people), industry, agriculture, aquaculture, trade and services.
   The geomorphology of the coastal zone is controlled by sediment inputs,
   nearshore water circulation, and the level of wave activity. The large
   quantities of sediments (with yields > 500 tonnes/km(2) per year),
   delivered annually by the main rivers (Axios, Aliakmon, Pinios, and
   Gallikos) and other seasonal streams are responsible for the general
   progradation of the coastline and the formation of the Holocene
   sedimentary cover over the seabed of the Gulf. Changes to the coastline
   can be identified on macro- and meso-time scales; the former include the
   evolution of the deltaic plains (at >1 km(2)/year), while the latter
   incorporates seasonal changes along sections of the coastline (e.g.
   sandy spits), mostly due to the anthropogenic activities. The overall
   water circulation pattern in Thermaikos Gulf is characterised by
   northerly water movement, from the central and eastern part of the Gulf;
   this is compensated by southerly movement along its western part. The
   prevailing climate (winds and pressure systems) appears to control the
   surface water circulation, while near-bed current measurements reveal a
   general moderate (<15 cm/s) southerly flow, i.e. offshore, towards the
   deep water Sporades Basin. Waves approaching from southerly directions
   play also a role in controlling the shoreline configuration. Various
   human activities within the coastal system place considerable pressure
   on the natural evolution of the coastal zone ecosystem, Thus, the
   construction of darns along the routes of the main rivers has reduced
   dramatically the water/sediment fluxes; this caused, for example,
   retreat of the deltaic coastlines and seawater intrusion into the
   groundwater aquifers. Similarly, pollution and/or eutrophication of the
   nearshore marine environment have resulted from the inputs of industrial
   wastes, urban untreated sewage, and agricultural activities on the
   coastal plains. This effect is demonstrated by high levels of
   pollutants, nutrients, and by the increased concentrations of
   non-residual trace-metals within the surficial sediments. Finally,
   climatic changes associated with a potential rise in sea level (i.e.
   30-50 cm) will threaten a substantial part of the low-lying lands of
   Thermaikos Gulf. Thus, systematic and thorough monitoring is needed in
   order to protect the coastal ecosystem; this will ensure its sustainable
   development and successful management, in relation to present and future
   socio-economic activities and climatic changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Wetland conservation efforts require knowledge of space use by a
   diversity of waterbirds. However, determining space use of animals
   requires intensive monitoring of individual organisms. Often, activity
   patterns during much of the annual cycle are neglected in analyses of
   home range and habitat use. From 1995-97, we monitored space use in a
   population of individually marked killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) that
   breed, and reside for a number of additional months each year, in the
   western Great Basin. We used linear distance measures and home
   range-area estimates, derived by fixed-kernel methods, to examine
   patterns of space use of adults prior to, during, and following nesting.
   Overall, killdeer used a local area of approximately 6 ha. Birds
   remained closer to nests while tending eggs than either before or after
   nesting, although extensive movements away from the nest were observed
   during all time periods. Females tended to move farther from nests than
   did males. Birds nesting farther from water bodies were generally
   observed at greater distances from nests than those nesting closet to
   shorelines during all time periods. Twenty-seven percent of individuals
   were observed greater than 1 km from nest locations, particularly during
   postnesting periods. During nesting periods, males were less likely to
   be observed at longer distances from nests than were females. There were
   no differences in home range size based upon sex, time period, or
   distance from water. We suggest that home range size may not always
   accurately measure differences in space use and that multiple measures,
   including distance from nests, should be considered. Understanding the
   sedentary nature of killdeer during much of the annual cycle and their
   intense use of local areas is important for making management decisions.
   Coupled with data on other shorebird species, this information also has
   broader implications for management of wetland systems by indicating
   large scale spatial and habitat requirements and the connectivity of
   geographically distinct habitat patches.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995 we initiated a study in a nature preserve invaded by Alliaria
   petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara \& Grande (garlic mustard) to determine if
   repeated dormant-season bums would affect A. petiolata abundance and
   understory community composition. Preburn data were collected in summer
   1995 at lowland and upland sites. Mid-intensity fall burns occurred in
   1995 and 1996 at the lowland site and in 1995, 1996, and 1997 at the
   upland site. We monitored the understory community in the summers of
   1995 to 1998 along permanent transects, conducted a one-time plot study
   of the spring under story community in 1998, and also recorded
   information on the populations of woody seedlings and saplings in 1995
   and 1998. Mid-summer sampling showed that unburned and burned plots had
   similar long-term trends in A. petiolata populations. At both sites
   there was no significant effect of burning on either A. petiolata
   abundance or relative importance. In spring 1998 burned plots had
   significantly higher densities of A. petiolata flowering stems, lower
   densities of seedlings, and higher importance of A. petiolata. Although
   garlic mustard is not fire-tolerant, several factors contribute to
   population persistence under a repeated burning regimen. Our research
   corroborates previous studies demonstrating that dormant-season burning
   is not a viable approach for A. petiolata control. Repeated long-term
   monitoring of thr summer plant community suggested that burning induced
   a directional change in lowland plots hut not in the upland plots.
   Eupatorium rugosum Houtt. and Pilea pumila (L.) Gray responded
   positively to burning. Monitoring of the spring 1998 community showed
   that A. petiolata responded to burning with increased importance,
   whereas Galium aparine (L.) and Stellaria media (L.) Cyrillo (lowland
   site) responded to burning with decreased importance. Burning had no
   significant effect on species richness. Responses of woody seedlings and
   saplings to burning were site-specific. At the upland site, burning
   accelerated the loss of woody seedlings and saplings. The utility of
   dormant-season burning in deciduous forests probably will depend on a
   choice between management goals for understory structure and those far
   species composition.}},

Abstract = {{The history of the endemic rodents of the Galapagos Islands began with

   Unfortunately, of the seven described species known to occur in the
   islands during the past 150 years, only two were known to be extant to
   1995. Since then, two expeditions to the Galapagos Islands have been
   conducted to survey endemic rodent populations. The first confirmed the
   existence of a small endemic rice rat, Nesoryzomys fernandinae, on
   Fernandina, known previously only from owl pellet remains found in 1979.
   In 1997, an expedition to Santiago revealed a population of the larger
   rice rat N. swarthi, a species collected alive only once in 1906 and
   considered extinct in all recent literature on the Galapagos Islands.
   Survey efforts on Santa Cruz resulted only in the collection of
   introduced rodent species (Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus and Mus
   musculus). The extant species of native rodents in the Galapagos Islands
   now number four: N. narboroughi and N. fernandinae on Fernandina; N.
   swarthi on Santiago; and Oryzomys bauri on Santa Fe. Three species are
   found on islands where no introduced rodents or cats occur, whereas only
   one (N. swarthi) co-exists with R. rattus and M. musculus. Nesoryzomys
   darwini and N. indefessus on Santa Cruz and O. galapagoensis on San
   Cristobal are still considered extinct. Strategies for conservation
   should include monitoring islands for introduced rodents and cats,
   development of emergency plans in the event of introductions, and
   captive management.}},

Abstract = {{Przewalski's gazelle Procapra przewalskii is endemic to China and is
   classified as Critically Endangered by IUCN-The World Conservation
   Union. Historically, the species occurred in parts of the provinces of
   Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia and Qinghai but now appears to be
   restricted to three populations around Qinghai Lake. These three
   populations-Bird Island, Hudong-Ketu and Yuanzhe-have all declined since
   1988. The populations have been monitored since 1994 and the smallest,
   on Bird Island, appears to be on the brink of extinction, with only
   seven individuals being recorded in 1998. In the same year, the
   Hudong-Ketu population comprised 56 individuals (29.4 per cent males, 50
   per cent females and 21 per cent juveniles) and the Yuanzhe population
   51 individuals (29.4 per cent males, 43.1 per cent females and 27.5 per
   cent juveniles). The causes of the declines vary for each population but
   include loss of habitat as a result of desertification, poaching and,
   possibly, wolf predation. Human activity and high juvenile mortality are
   major threats to the continued survival of the gazelle. Conservation
   measures proposed are: (i) the establishment of a special reserve for
   Przewalski's gazelle; (ii) a study of the wolf-gazelle relationship and
   control of the number of wolves if necessary; (iii) a search for remnant
   populations of Przewalski's gazelle in other regions in their historical
   range and the identification of suitable sites for translocation and
   establishment of new populations.}},

Abstract = {{Response to glyphosate and isozyme variation were investigated in eight
   populations of Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers (var dactylon) selected from 58
   native populations from Italy. Morphological and phenological
   observations allowed the identification of four populations as temperate
   biotypes and the remaining four populations as seleucidus biotypes. No
   populations were resistant to the recommended dose of glyphosate (3600 g
   AE ha(-1)). At the sublethal doses of 1800, 900 + 900 and 450 + 450 g AE
   ha(-1), seleucidus accessions were 8.6, 2.7 and 3.4 times more tolerant
   than temperate accessions, respectively. Electrophoretic patterns of
   seven enzyme systems evidenced a total of 34 bands and 28 phenotypes
   across the eight populations. Isozyme variation between populations
   contributed the major proportion of total diversity of the variable
   detected isozymes, while the contribution of within-population variation
   was negligible. Total phenotypic variation was in agreement with values
   reported for cosmopolitan and geographically widespread species. The low
   levels of within-population diversity match the predominantly asexual
   reproduction strategy of the populations examined. Classification and
   ordination techniques revealed that the different genetic structures of
   seleucidus and temperate populations are associated with distinct
   responses to sublethal doses of glyphosate. The results confirmed the
   presence of an association between morphometric and isozyme variability
   in the populations of C dactylon. The role of monitoring perennial weeds
   to evaluate the agricultural impact of the introduction of genetically
   engineered crops with novel traits such as resistance to glyphosate is
   discussed. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Egg cells were analysed cytologically during the female receptivity

   perinuclear cytoplasm located in the middle of the cell; type C - big
   cells with a large apical vacuole and the mid-basal perinuclear
   cytoplasm. The less-dense cytoplasm of the vacuolated egg cells usually
   contained numerous cup- or bell-shaped mitochondria. The three egg types
   appeal to correspond to three late stages of egg cell differentiation.
   The frequencies of each of the three egg types were monitored in
   developing maize ears before and after pollination. In young ears, with
   the silks just extending out of the husks, small A-type cells were found
   in about 86\% of ovules. Their frequency decreased to about 58\% at the
   optimum silk Length, remained unchanged in non-pollinated ears, and fell
   to 16\% at the end of the female receptivity period. However, after
   pollination and before fertilisation the frequency of these cells
   decreased to about 33\%, and the larger vacuolated egg tells (types B
   and C) prevailed. At various stages of the receptivity period,
   pollination accelerated changes in the egg population, increasing the
   number of ovules bearing larger, vacuolated egg cells. Experiments with
   silk removal demonstrated that putative pollination signals act
   immediately after pollen deposition and are not species-specific.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnosing herbicide-resistant weeds as a first step in resistance
   management and monitoring their nature, distribution, and abundance
   demands efficient and effective screening tests. This review summarizes
   and recommends appropriate seed sampling techniques, protocols for
   screening weeds for resistance to herbicides of different sites of
   action, interpretation of results, and information given to the grower.
   Elements common to all screening procedures are reviewed. Choosing
   appropriate discriminating doses to distinguish between resistant and
   susceptible weed biotypes is the most important factor in achieving
   accurate and consistent results. Interpretation of results is also
   critical because resistant weeds may comprise a small portion of the
   population in suspected accessions or biotypes.}},

Abstract = {{The usefulness of microsatellite markers in pedigree analysis of the
   sika deer (Cervus nippon) was tested in a herd in which the maternal
   lineages were recorded. Eighteen sets of microsatellite primers
   originally designed for bovine, ovine, and cervine loci successfully
   amplified polymorphic DNA in the deer. The numbers of alleles per locus
   ranged from two to seven, and the observed heterozygosity ranged from
   0.350 to 0.900. The resolution power of the markers in paternity testing
   was then determined by calculating exclusion probabilities and paternity
   indices. Parentages of the study population were efficiently
   discriminated by genotyping 17 microsatellite loci. The microsatellite
   data were also used to calculate the genetic relatedness between
   individuals, which significantly correlated with coancestry coefficients
   for the pairs. Our results demonstrate that the microsatellite markers
   are efficient tools in studying the social structure and behavior of the
   sika deer, as well as in monitoring the inbreeding status.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing numbers and types of potential pollutants in the world
   oceans calls for novel strategies for their assays. The `Mussel Watch'
   well served the latter decades of the 20th century. For the immediate
   future, individual assays of the chemicals of concern should be replaced
   by the analyses of groups of pollutants which have a common impact upon
   marine organisms. Secondly, more attention should be focussed upon the
   benthos where many potential pollutants continue to accumulate. Impacts
   upon members of the marine biosphere may be recognized by population
   changes of individual species. Lastly, time frame monitoring studies
   should be initiated, so that long-term trends in the health of a system
   can be detected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Specimens of the gastropod Nucella lapillus were transplanted from their
   natural habitat to sites affected by tributyltin (TBT) pollution to
   diverse degrees; individuals were held in cages that also included
   mussels as food. Subsamples were taken from the cages and the natural
   site at different time intervals (1, 2 and 5 months) to compare growth,
   imposer (a set of sexual anomalies caused by TBT) and butyltin
   concentrations accumulated in female tissues. Individuals in cages
   experienced negligible mortality and considerable growth. In addition,
   while the Relative Penis Size Index (RPSI, an index of imposer) remained
   consistent in the natural site through the experiment, it increased
   markedly at the implant sites; the same applies to the butyltin
   residues. These results are discussed to conclude that cage
   transplanting of N. lapillus is a suitable technique that can quickly
   (i.e. 1 month) detect differences in the level of TBT contamination
   among sites; however, extrapolation of experimental results to the field
   seems to require a longer exposure time (at least 5 months). Finally,
   the use of such an approach is deemed helpful to interpret the
   relationship between N. lapillus population dynamics and TBT pollution.

Abstract = {{Spatial patterns of forest canopies are fractal as they exhibit
   variation over a continuum of scales. A measure of fractal dimension of
   a forested landscape represents the spatial summation of physiologic
   (leaf-level), demographic (population-level), and abiotic (e.g.,
   edaphic) processes, as well as exogenous disturbances (e.g., fire and
   hurricane) and thus provides a basis to classify or monitor such
   systems. However, forests typically exhibit a spectrum of fractal
   parameters which yields further insight to the geometric structure of
   the system and potentially the underlying processes. We calculated
   multifractal properties of longleaf pine flatwoods, the predominant
   ecosystem of central Florida, from canopy profile data derived from an
   airborne laser altimeter and ground-based measurements in The Nature
   Conservancy's Disney Wilderness Preserve located near Kissimmee,
   Florida. These metrics were compared for six approximate to 500 m
   transects to determine the level of consistency between remotely sensed
   and field measures and within a forest community. Multifractal
   techniques uncovered subtle differences between transects that could
   correspond to unique, underlying abiotic and biotic processes. These
   techniques should be considered a valuable tool for ecological analysis.

Abstract = {{In female vertebrates, differences in fatness often correspond to
   differences in phenotypic quality, suggesting that larger females have
   greater fitness. Variation in individual fitness can result from
   variation in life span and/or variation in yearly reproductive success,
   but no study has yet assessed the relationships between the components
   of fitness and phenotypic quality while controlling for life span. We
   tried to fill this gap using data from long-term monitoring (23 years)
   of marked roe deer and bighorn sheep, two ungulates with very different
   life histories. In both species, we found a strong positive relationship
   between an adult female's mass and her probability of reaching old age:
   over the long term, bigger is indeed better for ungulate females. On the
   other hand, we found no evidence in either species that heavier females
   had higher fitness when differences in life span were accounted for:
   over the short term, bigger is not necessarily better. Our results
   indicate that, while broad differences in phenotypic quality affect
   individual fitness, when differences, in life span are accounted for
   phenotypic quality has no residual effect on fitness. Therefore, within
   a given range of phenotypic quality, bigger is not always better, for
   reasons which may differ between species.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the relative population
   densities and habitat utilization of gamebird species in relation to
   plant communities, the amount of ecotone, and vegetation structure. The
   distribution of five terrestrial gamebird populations was monitored for
   12 months in the Nyslvley Nature Reserve, South Africa. Only three
   species, Swainson's francolin (40.44\% of the total gamebird
   population), crested francolin (10.41\%) and guineafowl (43.94\%), were
   found in significant numbers. Group sizes of these gamebird populations
   were typical for the species. The high amount of edge or ecotone (total
   amount of edge (DI) = 0.26), the short (9.36 cm) and evenly structured
   grass layer (mean Foliage Height Diversity (FHD) = 0.38), and a mosaic
   of open areas and termitaria thickets rendered the Sporobolus
   ioclados-Acacia tortilis Savanna suitable for gamebirds. The adjacent
   seasonally inundated floodplain was also utilized to some extent, mainly
   by Swainson's francolin. It appears that visibility is more important
   for gamebirds than a high diversity in grass structure. Also, a mosaic
   of feeding areas and cover makes an area suitable for terrestrial
   gamebirds. Of the gamebird species found in the reserve, only the
   Swainson's francolin, crested francolin and guineafowl populations had
   the potential to be harvested.}},

   England}},

Abstract = {{I. Micronecta poweri (Insecta: Corixidae) is potentially sensitive to
   changes in river flow. A field experiment was designed to assess the
   impact of an inter-basin water transfer on the distribution and
   abundance of M. poweri in the receiving River Wear, north-east England.
   2. The transfer increased river discharge threefold for a period of 1 h;
   the transfer discharge was then reduced to a rate equivalent to double
   the receiving flow. Velocity changes were variable: some parts of the
   river channel were subjected to order of magnitude increases in near-bed
   velocity, others suffered no perceptible change. Losses of fine
   particulate organic material were associated with the areas of greatest
   velocity increase.
   3. Downstream of the transfer outlet, average total M. poweri abundance
   in replicate samples was reduced by approximately 50\% during the
   transfer. Losses were variable within the 250 m reach monitored, with
   some areas gaining and some losing animals. Differences could not be
   explained simply as a function of proximity to the transfer outlet.
   4. Results suggest that transfer impacts are location specific, varying
   greatly even over short (250 m) distances. For flow sensitive taxa, even
   relatively minor flow changes (increasing discharge to the 50 percentile
   flow value) may be considered as disturbance events when viewed at the
   patch or reach scales.
   5. Despite the impacts identified for M. poweri, transfers are generally
   viewed as having a beneficial effect on the conservation of aquatic
   habitat in the River Wear. They ensure that water abstractions for
   potable and industrial supply can continue during the summer months
   without reducing the availability of suitable salmonid habitat. However,
   there remains a need to assess the possible transfer of biological
   material from the donor River Tyne to the receiving River Wear.

Abstract = {{In the 1960s, 27 muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) were introduced to
   Angujaartorfiup Nunaa, which is located next to Kangerlussuaq Airport in
   West Greenland. Data from 12 aerial surveys of muskoxen from 1986 to
   1996 show 1) that: the population has stabilized at 3000 muskoxen since
   hunting was initiated in 1988, 2) that the population has maintained a
   high level of reproduction during the study period, and 3) that an
   annual kill of about 700 muskoxen will maintain the population at its
   current revel if natural mortality and reproduction remain unchanged.
   Using a geographical information system to subdivide data by topography
   and altitude showed that muskoxen greatly favour valleys and lowland
   areas. Densities of muskoxen above 500 m above sea level were less than
   51\% of densities below 500 m above sea level.}},

Abstract = {{Frozen frog legs that had been shipped from Indonesia into the European
   Union were biochemically compared to reference muscle samples from wild
   Indonesian frog populations of different species. Frozen frog leg
   samples only allowed for the analysis of eight allozyme loci, two of
   which were polymorphic. The analyses clearly showed that all frog legs,
   despite their initial species declaration as Limnonectes macrodon, L.
   cancrivorus, L. limnocharis and Rana catesbeiana, all belonged to L.
   cancrivorus. Unless misclassification was intentional, it seems that
   Indonesian frog leg exporters are not able to discriminate between the
   species in trade. However, this ability should be the basis for a
   sustainable use of this wildlife resource. A test for management
   authorities is needed to monitor the international trade in frog legs.}},

Abstract = {{With a view to setting up a national conservation programme for
   endangered freshwater fish, a survey has been conducted to find out how
   these species were represented in the main French protected areas. Only
   a few of these were established specifically for fish protection. Not
   all of the threatened species are found in protected areas. When one of
   these species is found in a protected site, it is rarely monitored or
   subjected to a specific management plan and the same applies to other
   fish populations present. Moreover, the sites generally do not cover the
   whole area of a catchment basin; more often, only part of the basin or
   stream is protected, which is not enough to maintain the species.
   Various measures are recommended in order to correct the situation and
   to include protected areas within a coherent network so that they can
   become a major part of conservation efforts for threatened freshwater
   fish species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The micronuclei (MN) of peripheral blood lymphocytes from
   radiation-exposed people were monitored with the binucleated lymphocyte
   micronucleus assay (CBMN). MN rates in people with radiation-disease,
   radiation exposed and a control group were 12.57 parts per thousand,
   4.20 parts per thousand and 3.26 parts per thousand, respectively. The
   MN rate of patients with radiation-disease was significantly higher than
   those of other groups (P<0.01). The difference between the
   radiation-exposed group and control group was not significant (P >
   0.05). Meanwhile, chromosome aberrations (CA) of 3 groups were
   determined. The results were similar to those seen while the MN assay.
   CA rates were 2.06\%, 0.93\% and 0.69\%, respectively. CA rate of the
   radiation-disease group was significantly higher than that of other
   groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The difference between the
   radiation-exposed group and the control group was not significant (P >

Abstract = {{We present the results of a national survey of breeding Skylarks Alauda
   arvensis in Britain in 1997 carried out by the British Trust for
   Ornithology (BTO). Numbers of Skylarks and land-use types were recorded
   by volunteers in 608 1-km squares, selected using random stratification
   based on the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology's (ITE) Landscape
   Classification to avoid over- or under-sampling particular habitat
   types. The results suggest a maximum national population of around 1000
   000 pairs. This agrees extremely well with the national population
   estimate of around 1046 000 pairs derived from the Breeding Bird Survey
   (BBS) of the BTO/Joint Nature Conservation Committee/Royal Society for
   the Protection of Birds, and provides further evidence for the
   robustness of the BBS as a national monitoring scheme for common and
   widespread species. The figure is approximately half that of the most
   recent published estimate of 2000 000 in 1988-91. However, the scale of
   this discrepancy is likely to reflect a bias in Atlas field methodology
   and site selection since there has been a real decline of approximately
   9\% since 1990. Arable squares supported the highest densities of
   Skylarks; 4.6-6.0 pairs per km(2), and 46-49\% of the British breeding
   population was associated with arable areas. Marginal upland and upland
   areas supported lower densities but still accounted for approximately
   34\% of the estimated national breeding population. Differences in
   density at broad habitat scales were reflected in geographical
   differences across Britain, with southern and eastern arable regions
   supporting much higher densities than western and northern ones. At a
   finer scale, Skylarks occurred at highest densities on, and showed
   highest habitat preferences for, set-aside and various types of ungrazed
   grassland. Winter cereal, improved grassland and set-aside held the
   highest proportion of the Skylark population on farmland in England and
   Wales; grazed pasture, winter cereals and spring cereals held the
   highest proportion in Scotland.}},

Abstract = {{Ectocarpus, a cosmopolitan genus of filamentous marine brown algae,
   contains two species, E. siliculosus and E. fasciculatus. Both species
   are subject to virus infections, which either destroy the host's
   sporangia or persist in a latent state without visible symptoms. We used
   PCR amplification of a viral gene fragment to monitor the infection
   status of Ectocarpus samples from Gran Canaria Island, North Atlantic,
   and southern Chile over 26 months.
   At both sites, we found persistently high levels of pathogen prevalence:
   40-100\% of the Ectocarpus specimens from Chile and 55-100\% from Gran
   Canaria contained viral DNA. No evidence for seasonal variation could be
   detected. We conclude that vertical transmission of viral DNA through
   mitotic zoospores of the host is the key mechanism for the persistence
   of the pathogen. The PCR amplification characteristics of samples from
   Gran Canaria indicate that two different virus genotypes coexist in the
   same host population.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental populations of the ciliate Oxytricha bifaria grown at 24
   degrees C were exposed to progressively higher temperatures in a
   thermally isotropic environment. Their behaviour was monitored and an
   ethogram was drawn for each step of the warming process (24, 29, and 34
   degrees C), as well as for three further periods of time after the
   temperature was brought back to the initial 24 degrees C. As the
   temperature increased, (i) the percentage of mobile cells decreased
   (significantly at 34 degrees C), (ii) their periods of immobilisation
   were more frequent; (iii) their average creeping velocity did not
   change; (iv) the radius of the arcs and the length of both the linear
   segments and the arcs decreased; (v) the frequency of the
   ``side-stepping reaction{''} increased progressively, and (vi) it was
   often performed as bursts of reactions. Moreover, (vii) a new
   behavioural pattern, the ``maximum-rotation reaction,{''} was performed.
   When the ciliates were brought back to 24 degrees C, their behavioural
   parameters, except for general mobility, did not return to normal values
   during the first 90 min. Linear heating of the experimental populations
   of O. bifaria induced nonlinear and time-stable effects on their
   behaviour (12 out of 17 parameters actually changed at 34 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{A central goal in ecology is to predict population dynamics from
   demographic information. Based on the asymptotic population growth rate
   lambda, calculated from a projection matrix model as a descriptor of the
   population dynamics, we analyze published data of 49 species of birds to
   determine how lambda is influenced by variation in different demographic
   trails. Across species, the mean elasticity of the adult survival rate
   was significantly larger than the mean elasticity of the fecundity rate.
   The contribution of the fecundity rate to the population growth rate
   increased with increasing clutch size and decreasing adult survival
   rare. while the greatest contribution of adult survival rate occurred
   among long-lived species that matured late and laid few eggs. This
   represents a continuum from ``highly reproductive species{''} at one end
   to ``survivor species{''} at the other end. In addition, a high
   contribution of adult survival rate was found in some relatively
   long-lived species with early age at maturity (and a large clutch size)
   which was assumed to represent a bet-hedging strategy, i.e., producing a
   large number of offspring in some occasional good years. In a
   retrospective analysis. interspecific differences in the effects of
   actual temporal variation in adult survival rate and fecundity rats on
   the variability of lambda were analyzed. These effects are expected to
   be large when the variance or the sensitivity of the trait is large.
   Because there was a negative relationship among species, both for the
   adult survival rate and the fecundity rate between the variability and
   the sensitivity of the trait, contribution of a trait to the variance in
   lambda decreased with sensitivity. Similarly, within species, less
   temporal variation was found in traits with high elasticities than in
   traits with less contribution to lambda. In some species, covariance
   among matrix elements also influenced the contribution of a demographic
   trait to lambda. Monitoring schemes of bird demography should be
   designed in such a way that temporal variances and covariances among
   demographic traits can be estimated. Furthermore, it is important in
   such schemes to include data from a combination of traits that either
   have large sensitivities or high temporal variation.}},

Abstract = {{The population of silvereyes Zosterops lateralis chlorocephalus, on
   Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef has been monitored accurately since
   1965. Between 1979 and 1993, the breeding success of all birds was
   determined by monitoring nests. The population fluctuated between 225
   and 483 individuals. Four cyclones led to substantial mortality. As this
   data set is long-term, has little observation error, and is from an
   effectively closed population, it provides an unusual opportunity to
   examine density dependence in reproduction or mortality. Using a
   stochastic logistic model, we found clear evidence of density dependence
   in adult population size. Logistic regression suggested that fledgling
   survival decreased with the numbers of birds attempting to breed. There
   was also some suggestion that adult survival might be density dependent.
   The fitted stochastic logistic model predicts negligible risks of
   extinction for this population, in contrast to the predictions of a
   published population viability analysis. Whilst our statistical model
   including density dependence may provide better predictions of the
   ``usual{''} behaviour of a population than a population viability
   analysis, we suggest that caution should be exercised when statistically
   fitted models are used to predict the behaviour of the population at
   extremes, such as near extinction.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program was initiated in
   1989 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to collect,
   analyze, and report quantitative, statistically unbiased information
   about the state of the nation's environment on a regional basis. During
   a pilot program in Nebraska we measured a habitat suitability index for
   a probability sample of 40 windbreaks and expanded the results to
   estimate the potential value of windbreaks as wildlife habitat in
   Nebraska. The index estimates the suitability of a windbreak as habitat
   for wildlife including breeding birds, small mammals, and deer. Index
   values range from zero to one, where a value of one indicates maximal
   habitat value. We estimated that 50\% (+/- 13\% at 90\% confidence) of
   windbreaks in Nebraska have a habitat suitability index of 0.25 or less
   and that no windbreaks have a suitability index greater than 0.6. Our
   results indicate that increasing the area of individual windbreaks is
   the most effective way to improve their value as wildlife habitat.
   Monitoring windbreak condition over time would alert wildlife managers
   to changes in the resource that might affect wildlife populations.
   Because our data were highly variable, the power to detect change in
   habitat condition between two measurement periods was low. A much larger
   sample would be required to detect small changes in habitat condition.
   Variability may be reduced, and power increased, by carefully and
   consistently constructing the sampling frame, keeping data collection as
   simple as possible, appropriately stratifying sample selection, and
   using a small number of well-trained data collection teams. However, we
   suggest adapting the index for use with aerial photography in future
   efforts to evaluate windbreaks as wildlife habitat in extensive areas.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas fluorescens HK44 represents the first genetically engineered
   microorganism approved for field testing in the United States for
   bioremediation purposes. Strain HK44 harbors an introduced lux gene
   fused within a naphthalene degradative pathway, thereby allowing this
   recombinant microbe to bioluminesce as it degrades specific polyaromatic
   hydrocarbons such as naphthalene. The biore-mediation process can
   therefore be monitored by the detection of light. P. fluorescens HK44
   was inoculated into the vadose zone of intermediate-scale, semicontained
   soil lysimeters contaminated with naphthalene, anthracene, and
   phenanthrene, and the population dynamics were followed over an
   approximate 2-year period in order to assess the long-term efficacy of
   using strain HK44 for monitoring and controlling bioremediation
   processes. Results showed that P, fluorescens HK44 was capable of
   surviving initial inoculation into both hydrocarbon contaminated and
   uncontaminated soils and was recoverable from these soils 660 days post
   inoculation. It was also demonstrated that strain HK44 was capable of
   generating bioluminescence in response to soil hydrocarbon
   bioavailability. Bioluminescence approaching 166 000 counts/s was
   detected in fiber optic-based biosensor devices responding to volatile
   polyaromatic hydrocarbons, while a portable photomultiplier module
   detected bioluminescence at an average of 4300 counts/s directly from
   soil-borne HK44 cells within localized treatment areas. The utilization
   of lux-based bio-reporter microorganisms therefore promises to be a
   viable option for in situ determination of environmental contaminant
   bioavailability and biodegradation process monitoring and control.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined use of the oyster Crassostrea gigas as a
   bioindicator of experimental pollution caused by two concentrations of
   live pesticides (atrazine, isoproturon, alachlore, metolachlore, and
   diuron) used in agricultural and urban activities. The effect of these
   pesticides on the genetic structure of the marine bivalve was studied as
   part of an environmental biomonitoring project. This research was
   performed on two natural estuarine populations sampled along the French
   Atlantic coast as part of an ongoing monitoring program to survey the
   ecosystem of Brittany using two approaches: identifying the genetic
   markers based on the alleles and genotypes associated with pollution
   effects, and searching for a correlation between these markers and the
   sensitivity or tolerance of individuals under stress conditions. Results
   indicate a differential survival of individuals subjected to the various
   pollutants examined. The sensitivity of alleles and genotypes to
   environmental stress can be assessed based on the significant
   differences in allele and genotype frequencies observed between
   resistant and sensitive individuals: when subjected to the pesticides.
   This genetic study included examination of five enzyme systems (Ak, Pgi,
   Cap, Pgm, and Mdh) involved in physiologic processes. A total of six
   alleles and five genotypes at three loci (Ak, Pgi, and Pgm) were
   identified as being markers of resistance or sensitivity. It is
   hypothesized that these markers could be used as potential generic
   markers in estuarine ecosystem monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper questions the adequacy of using length-weight
   regressions and growth rates calculated in the laboratory under constant
   physico-chemical and food conditions for the estimation of biomass and
   secondary production of animals living in a variable environment from
   the physico-chemistry and food availability point of view. Length-weight
   regressions (LWR) and growth rate of Daphnia magna were determined in
   situ at five key periods of the year. In parallel, LWR and growth rate
   were determined in laboratory incubators at temperature adjusted to the
   mean temperature measured during the in situ experiments. LWR estimated
   from pond daphnids collected during the in situ experiments were, on the
   whole, not significantly different from LWR established during
   laboratory experiments, indicating that the food availability was
   globally similar in the laboratory and in situ experiments, even though
   food items were substantially different between the experiments. In situ
   algal biomass was indeed low compared to the algal biomass in laboratory
   experiments, but high biomasses of bacteria, protozoa and detritus were
   available for daphnid feeding in the tubes incubated in situ. Growth
   rate of D. magna was monitored in situ using 50-ml tubes closed with
   Nylon net (mesh size = 80 mu m) and in the laboratory using 50-ml glass
   flasks. The physico-chemical, bacteriological and algological variables
   were checked to be similar in the tubes and in the pond. Growth rates
   varied according to the size of the animal and according to the water
   temperature. The maximum growth rates were observed for juveniles at
   20.2 degrees C. Growth rates were also determined in the laboratory at
   temperature corresponding to the mean temperature recorded in the pond
   during the in situ growth experiments. Differences between in situ and
   laboratory body length-growth rate regressions (LgR) were observed for
   the experiments conducted at 15.6 degrees C and 23.6 degrees C. Due to
   differences in LWR and LgR between in situ and laboratory experiments,
   biomass and daily production estimated from laboratory cultures were
   found to be significantly, but not severely, higher than biomass and
   daily production estimated on the basis of in situ experiments. It has
   been, therefore, concluded that, when the constraints linked to the
   realization of in situ growth experiments are too strong, the laboratory
   approach is fully justified.}},

Abstract = {{1. We examined the effects of food and predators on population
   limitation in the arctic ground squirrel (Spermophilus parryii plesius
   Richardson) in the boreal forest of the south-western Yukon. We focused
   on ground squirrel reproduction and overwinter survival.
   2. Squirrel populations were monitored by live-trapping and
   radio-telemetry from 1993 to the spring of 1996 on four control and four
   experimental areas (one predator exclosure treatment, two food addition
   treatments, and one predator exclosure plus food addition treatment).
   3. Predator exclusion increased body condition, percentage lactating,
   percentage weaning litters, litter size, and doubled population density
   relative to controls, but had no effect on juvenile growth rate,
   overwinter survival, or juvenile emergence date.
   4. Food addition advanced juvenile emergence date and increased adult
   body condition, percentage lactating, percentage weaning litters, litter
   size, population density relative to controls (4-7 fold), but had no
   effect on juvenile growth rate or overwinter survival.
   5. Predator exclusion combined with food addition increased adult body
   condition, percentage lactating, percentage weaning litters, and
   population density relative to controls (19-fold).
   6. We conclude that arctic ground squirrels in the boreal forest are
   limited by an interaction between food and predation, acting primarily
   through changes in reproduction, and that their impact on density was
   multiplicative.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus were exposed to the fish pathogens
   infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and infectious pancreatic
   necrosis virus (IPNV) to estimate susceptibility of the species to
   infection. Fish were immersion challenged at 46, 74, and 95 d posthatch
   for 5 h in viral concentration of 10(3) or 10(5) PFU(plaque-forming
   units)/mL and were monitored for 21 d postchallenge. Fish that died were
   assayed individually for virus-associated mortality, and survivors were
   assayed individually to estimate prevalence of virus carrier status.
   Arctic char succumbed to IHNV infection with population losses as high
   as 41\%, and prevalence of IHNV carriers in surviving fish was 24\% or
   less with virus titers in carrier fish ranging from 2.5 x 10(2) PFU/g to
   greater than 1.3 x 10(6) PFU/g. Infections with IPNV resulted in losses
   of 20\% or less, and prevalence of IPNV carriers in surviving fish was
   as high as 82\% with virus titers in carrier fish ranging from 2.5 x
   10(2) PFU/g to greater than 5.0 x 10(6) PFU/g Logistic regression models
   were developed for the mortality and infection data for each virus. For
   IHNV, the odds of dying or becoming infected were significantly greater
   for the fish from the 74-d age-group than for the fish from the 46-d or
   95-d age-groups. Fish exposed to 10(5) PFU of IHNV/mL had significantly
   greater odds of dying or becoming infected than fish exposed to 10(3)
   PFU/mL. For IPNV, the odds of dying were significantly greater for the
   74-d age-group compared with the other tyro age-groups. The 74-d fish
   were also significantly more likely to become infected than the 95-d-old
   fish. Fish exposed to 10(5) PFU of IPNV/mL had significantly greater

Abstract = {{Aim To document changes in the floristic composition and vegetation
   structure of Carnac Island during a period of 40 years. This paper
   presents a synthesis of all available floristic and vegetational
   information.
   Location Carnac Island is 8 km offshore from Fremantle, south-west
   Western Australia.
   Methods Comparison of lists of plant species for 1951, 1958/9, 1966/7,
   1975/6 and 1995-6. Comparison of vegetation, based on structural and
   floristic elements, for 1951, 1965, 1972, 1984 and 1995.
   Results Floristic composition (both native and exotic species) changed
   most dramatically in the period 1975/6-1995/6, with a 37\% reduction in
   number of plant species. The number of annual and perennial native
   species present in 1995/6 was most similar to that in 1951. The most
   remarkable change in the flora has been the increase in annual exotic
   species since 1951. Immigration and extinction rates were greatest in
   the periods 1951-58/9 and 1958/9-1966/7, respectively. Vegetation
   structure has also altered, involving a reduction in height of dominant
   species from 3-4 m to 1 m as Acacia rostellifera and Olearia axillaris
   have declined in distribution. The weed species Mesembryanthemum
   crystallinum (first recorded 1975) and Malva parviflora (1958) now
   dominate the vegetation of half the island.
   Main conclusions Five factors are considered to have contributed to
   botanical change: nesting seabird populations, eradication of the rabbit
   in 1969, drought, increased salt-load from occasional cyclones in summer
   or autumn, and competition from increasing dominance of several weed
   species. Several of these factors have operated in opposing ways with
   respect to plant species richness and vegetation cover: Experimental
   studies are required to determine the strength of these interactions.
   Two weed species, Zantedeschia aethiopica (first recorded 1966) and

Abstract = {{Increased production of glucocorticoids by the adrenal cortex is found
   in mammals under stress. As cortisol itself is absent in the faeces, an
   enzyme immunoassay (11-oxoactiocholanolone) measuring
   11,17-dioxoandrostanes has already been established to measure faecal
   cortisol metabolites in ruminants for non-invasive monitoring of
   adrenocortical activity. The aim of this study was to establish route
   and delay of excretion of glucocorticoids in hares and to determine
   whether a cortisol-, corticosterone- or this new enzyme immunoassay is
   best suited to detect faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. In the first
   experiment radioactive-labelled glucocorticoids (C-14-cortisol and
   H-3-corticosterone) were administered intravenously to two groups of
   three hal es in metabolic cages. All voided urine and faecal samples
   were collected for 4 days. Metabolites of both steroids were found
   predominantly ill the urine (91 +/- 4\%). Peak concentrations were
   observed in the first urinary sample following infusion (13 +/- 6 h) and
   ill the faeces with a delay of about 1 day (23 +/- 7 h). Most of the
   radioactivity was not extractable with diethylether, indicating that the
   metabolites excreted in urine and faeces are mainly conjugated or polar
   unconjugated ones. This was confirmed by reverse-phase high-performance
   liquid chromatography separations of the metabolites, which also
   revealed marked differences concerning the metabolism of the two
   glucocorticoids injected. Compared with the cortisol and the
   corticosterone enzyme immunoassay, only the group-specific enzyme
   immunoassay for 11,17-dioxoandrostanes detected high quantities of
   immunoreactive metabolites. In a second experiment hares (n = 20) were
   stressed by rousing them three times (5 min, 10 min and another 5 min)
   with a 20-min break in-between. Faecal samples were collected 2 days
   before until 4 days after stress and analysed using the
   11-oxoaetiocholanolone enzyme immunoassay. After stress significantly (P
   < 0.001) increased 11,17-dioxoandrostane concentrations were found.
   Based on these results, measuring 11,17-dioxoandrostanes in faeces
   enables non-invasive monitoring of disturbances in hares and thus
   provides a tool for field investigations elucidating the role of stress
   in hare populations.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of the second German Environmental Survey carried out
   in the Western part of Germany in 1990/91 (GerES IIa) 113 adults aged
   25-69 years were selected at random from the total study population of
   about 2500 to investigate personal exposure to about 70 volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs). Each subject wore a diffusive badge-type sampler for 1
   week. The VOCs determined included alkanes, aromatics, aliphatic
   halocarbons, terpenes, and oxygen-containing compounds. Multivariate
   regression analysis was carried out to determine and quantify the major
   sources of personal exposure to Various VOCs. In this paper, results are
   given for benzene, and C8- and C9-aromatics. Being subject to
   environmental tobacco smoke was found to be the most important
   determinant of benzene exposure, but automobile-related activities such
   as driving a car or refuelling, were also associated with significantly
   increased levels of benzene. The major determinant of C8- and
   C9-aromatics concentrations was occupational exposure. Emissions from
   paints, lacquers, newspapers, magazines and print-works were also
   important contributors to C8-aromatics exposure. Renovation. painting
   and smoking were associated with a significant increase of the exposure
   to C9-aromatics.}},

Abstract = {{From 1992 to 1997, I monitored population size and productivity of
   Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) nesting along 80 km of coast on the eastern
   side of the Gulf of California, Mexico. During the study period, the
   number of nesting pairs increased by an estimated 5-14\%. The percentage
   of successful pairs varied significantly among years, ranging from 50\%.
   In three of the six years, the productivity of breeding pairs exceeded
   the estimated level necessary to maintain Osprey population size in at
   least parts of the species' range. However, three of the last four years
   were characterized by low reproductive success and by a higher
   proportion of late clutches. In 1997, the most unproductive of the six
   years, 38 of 40 (95\%) nesting pairs failed to produce any fledgling.
   That same year; however, the observed productivity of 10 pairs on two
   nearby islands was 15 times higher than on the mainland. In 1994, 1995,
   and 1996, successful pairs were significantly clumped, indicating that
   in the study area, nesting success was strongly influenced by local
   factors. The results of this study warrant further research to identify
   the source(s) of annual and spatial differences in nesting success.}},

Abstract = {{The requirement for selenium (IV) was assessed in five strains of the
   toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum Graham, representing three
   populations from Tasmania (Australia), as well as one each from Japan
   and Spain. Strains were grown in nutrient-enriched sea water medium with
   10(-9) M selenium added as selenite (H(2)SeO(3)), or with no added
   selenium, and monitored for growth and cell yield. Strains exhibited
   different selenium (Se) requirements, as evidenced by (i) a decrease in
   exponential growth rate (10-20\%) and cell yield (up to 80\%) (Japanese
   strain); (ii) a decrease in cell yield only (Tasmania Derwent Estuary
   1987, Tasmania Huon Estuary and Spanish strains); and (iii) no decrease
   in growth or cell yield (Tasmania Derwent Estuary 1993 strain).
   Variation in the response to Se deficiency was greatest between the two
   strains isolated from the Denwent Estuary, Tasmania, in different years
   (1987 and 1993) and less between Tasmanian strains from different
   localities (Huon and Derwent Estuaries are 50 km apart) or between
   Tasmanian and Japanese or Spanish strains. Strain variability in
   micro-nutrient responses such as described here may provide a partial
   explanation for different bloom patterns exhibited by the same
   dinoflagellate taxon under apparently similar environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A system was designed for the continuous surface monitoring of
   hydrological, bio-optical, and biogeochemical properties in the vicinity
   of the Almeria-Oran jet-front system (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea).
   This system included a thermosalinograph, a fluorometer, an optical
   particle counter, and an absorbance-attenuance meter (AC9), allowing the
   estimation of the absorption {[}a(lambda), (m(-1))] and scattering
   {[}b(lambda), (m(-1))] coefficients at nine wavelengths. More than 500
   multivariate records were acquired over a transect crossing the
   jet-front system three times and encompassing the diversity of water
   types encountered in this area. A method is proposed to retrieve
   relevant biogeochemical or bio-optical quantities, among which are the
   chlorophyll a concentration {[}from a(676)], the particulate carbon
   concentration {[}from b(555)], the colored dissolved organic matter
   {[}CDOM, from a(412)], and the chlorophyll-specific scattering
   coefficient at 555 nm, b{*}(555) (m(2) mg Chi a(-1)). The analyses of
   these various quantities with respect to the surface hydrodynamic fields
   reveal two main features. First, the particle pool displays highly
   dynamic quantitative variations across the frontal structure.
   Qualitatively, flagellate-dominated populations are associated with
   moderate density waters and maximal jet velocity, while diatoms are
   recorded at the narrow limit between the jet-front and the Mediterranean
   waters, where jet velocity is minimal. Second, the CDOM pool presents
   remarkable covariations with the surface-density field. In particular,
   the lowest a(CDOM)(412) values are reproducibly associated with the
   highest density values, which track upwelled flow associated with the
   frontal circulation; accumulation of CDOM is always observed inside the
   frontal waters, at a density value of 27.2 kg m(-3) These CDOM
   variations suggest that the frontal system is the place of enhanced
   biological activity.}},

Abstract = {{The semi-arid Northern Cape is the largest and most sparsely populated
   province in South Africa. One of the main economic activities is sheep
   farming, and the properties are generally very large (>5 000 ha). A
   heterogeneous environment results in many habitats fora wide diversity
   of raptors. Fifty-one different species have been recorded, of which 37
   are resident, 21 are common, and eight species are listed in the South
   African Red Data Book - Birds. As habitat degradation is limited,
   besides the areas immediately adjacent to the perennial rivers, raptors
   are still commonly encountered in many areas. Conflict with small-stock
   farming, however, results in some birds being inadvertently or directly
   persecuted each year. Two farmer questionnaire postal surveys (1976 and
   1992) indicated a decrease in range and abundance of certain scavenging
   species, such as the Tawny Eagle. The more recent survey also indicated
   that most stock mortalities occurred in the mountainous areas, with the
   Black Eagle being the apparent culprit. Zn the Northern Cape there are
   both positive and negative anthropogenic effects on raptors. For
   example, 14 species have been recorded breeding on man-made structures,
   while 18 species have been documented to drown in farm reservoirs.
   Through the activities of the Raptor Conservation Group, the Northern
   Cape Nature Conservation Service and the Northern Cape Raptor
   Conservation Forum various threats are being addressed. Raptor
   conservation activities include: monitoring of raptor breeding
   populations, road censuses, farmer extension, establishment of raptor
   conservancies, rehabilitation of injured raptors, issuing of
   certificates to land-owners who have breeding raptors on their
   properties, presentation of the annual Gariep Raptor Conservationist
   Award, production and distribution of raptor pamphlets and booklets,
   modification of farm reservoirs to prevent raptor drownings,
   modification of powerlines to prevent electrocutions, and establishment
   of ``vulture restaurants{''}. Through these efforts, the status of many
   raptor species is improving and species such as the Bateleur and
   Lappet-faced Vulture are becoming increasingly common.}},

Abstract = {{In Kenya, management of sport hunting of gamebirds is centralised, with
   a government parastatal body. Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), setting
   seasons, quotas and fees, and collecting revenue. Quotas are arbitrarily
   set, and the system prov ides few incentives for local communities to
   manage their gamebirds. Beginning in November 1993, we have been
   developing a model system in which the responsibility for monitoring
   gamebird populations and managing shooting is assumed by pastoral
   landowners. On Mbirikani Group Ranch in southern Kenya, two local field
   assistants were employed by the ranch to provide information on hunting
   areas in the field, and check adherence to quotas. They were also
   trained to collect regular data on relative abundance and breeding
   condition of two focal species, Yellow-necked Spurfowl Francolinus
   leucoscepus and Helmeted Guineafowl Numida meleagris. By agreement with
   the group ranch committee, all bookings are handled by an individual
   hunter who also guarantees a minimum annual return. Over three years,
   direct earnings from gamebird hunting increased nine-fold to c. US \$6
   400 annually. The success of this system, which is now being replicated
   elsewhere, suggests that gamebird hunting can generate significant
   income for local pastoral communities in arid and semi-arid areas in
   Kenya.}},

Abstract = {{The Logone floodplain in the sahelo-Sudanian zone of Cameroon used to be
   a highly productive ecosystem. Perennial pastures and fish played a
   crucial role for fishermen, pastoralists and wildlife. The construction
   of an upstream dam reduced inundation causing widespread degradation
   Nonetheless, approximately 350 bird species have still been observed.
   They include eleven waterfowl species which surpass the IWRB/Rarnsar
   criterion one \% of West African population). The few available surveys
   suggest that prior to the dam construction the area harbored an even
   more abundant birdlife. Presently possibilities exist to release excess
   water for floodplain rehabilitation. In 1994, a pilot release has been
   executed to verify predicted advantages for men and wildlife. Larger
   scale rehabilitation of the Logone floodplain is formulated, based on
   the pilot release results. Annual total waterfowl, as well as heron
   colony counts have been executed showing an increase in bird numbers.
   Data variability questions somewhat the conclusion that this has been
   exclusively clue to increased flooding. Additionally, bird populations
   of degraded annual grasslands and well flooded perennial grasslands have
   been assessed by line transacts. Results showed the much higher numbers
   of waterfowl and passerines in perennial grassland. Hydrological and
   vegetation monitoring showed a change of annual into perennial grassland
   due to the re-flooding, which might lead to increased bird populations.
   Questions remain how to extrapolate these findings to the entire area to
   be re-flooded, justifying continuous counting and studying factors
   limiting bird populations. Such a study started for the Black Crowned
   Crane, a resident flagship species. For migratory species, surveys are
   recommended to assess thr role of other wetlands in the Lake Chad basin.}},

Abstract = {{Access to reliable population data is crucial for effective conservation
   and management of birds. So far, relatively little attention has been
   paid to assessing and monitoring bird populations in Africa. This is
   beginning to change. Regional meetings, for example in East Africa, are
   discussing and defining standard methodologies, and making technical
   information more widely available. Researchers are using these methods
   to access the populations of threatened species, or those of economic
   value. Projects involving long-term monitoring, particularly of
   waterbirds, ale beginning to yield results that are useful for
   management. Some challenges that remain include: securing institutional
   and financial support for longterm monitoring work; integrating
   monitoring efforts (especially of migratory species) across borders;
   understanding the ecological significance of population trends; finding
   robust and reliable methods to census economically important species,
   such as game-birds; and making accurate global assessments of the
   populations of threatened species.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands International co-ordinates waterfowl counts in Africa. Counts
   from 1958-1990 were analysed in 1991, when the African Waterfowl Census
   (AfWC) was also launched. By 1996, 25 countries were participating. This
   preliminary appraisal of the AfWC shows that resulting data can be used
   to identify distribution and abundance patterns, although there are
   still significant gaps in AfWC coverage and focus. The degree to which
   AfWC data may be used to assess the conservation status of African
   waterfowl populations depends on a function of data quality, quantity
   and reliability. To enable this practical use of data, several
   priorities for future work are identified, based on the strengths and
   weaknesses of the current information: (1) simultaneous coordinated
   counts, (2) regular annual or biannual monitoring of the same sites, (3)
   development of priority list of sites for regular survey, (4) frequent
   monitoring of particularly important sites (e.g. every three months),
   (5) building waterbird surveys into broader programmes of ecological
   monitoring, (6) planning of special internationally co-ordinated
   surveys, (7) planning regular complete surveys in major wetlands, e.g.
   every five years, and (8) extending the AfWC to other taxa and broader
   surveys of wetland use by man. In Africa, 522 discrete waterbird
   populations have been identified. Over half the populations for which
   trends have been established are in decline. Results from a recent atlas
   of Anatidae are illustrated by the Fulvous Whistling-Duck Dendrocygna
   bicolor, for which three discrete populations and 21 key sites are
   identified. Wetlands are the most important habitats for waterbirds.
   Many species (e.g. Grey Heron Ardea cinerea) exploit a variety of
   wetland types and are geographically widespread; those with special
   habitat requirements (e.g. Blue-winged Goose Cyanochen cyanopterus)
   often have restricted ranges. Hartlaub's Duck Pteronetta hartlaubi is
   one of the few waterbirds specific to the tropical forest biome. The
   movements of Abdim's Stork Ciconia abdimii in southern Africa show a
   clear response to rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{The Bossematie Forest, Eastern Ivory Coast, has repeatedly been logged
   but is now subject to rehabilitation carried out by the Ivorian SODEFOR
   (Societe de developpement des forets) in co-operation with the German
   GTZ (Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit). To estimate the
   conservation prospects of forest birds, the influence of selective
   cleaning, an applied forestry practice, on vegetation structure and on
   the understorey bird community was studied. Vertical vegetation coverage
   was described and mistnetting was carried out in ONO adjacent management
   zones, a 3-years-old treated plot and an untreated control plot. The
   understorey vegetation in the treated plot has been damaged by fallen
   midstorey trees. The treatment plot differed from the control plot
   mainly in forming a low, single-layered canopy, which is typical for
   early successional stages. The analysis of 810 captures shows clear
   differences in the bird communities: the number of individuals of
   so-called open-land species was significantly higher in the treated
   plot, whereas that of forest-interior species significantly decreased.
   The results are used for the adaptation of species lists for an existing
   monitoring program. This will show, whether the establishment of strict
   reserves and the spatial and temporal distribution of management
   activities can maintain populations of forest interior species in the
   Bossematie forest in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{An excised leaf disc assay was developed for determining the sensitivity
   of isolates of Plasmopara viticola (causal agent of grapevine downy
   mildew) to the strobilurin fungicide azoxystrobin. Five repeated assays
   with the same five single sporangiophore isolates showed that the
   technique yielded reproducible results; that is, coefficients of
   variation ranged from 4.0 to 20\% (mean 12\%) for effective doses for
   50\% control (ED50 values) based on disease incidence and from 4.4 to
   14\% (mean 8.1\%) for ED50 values based on disease severity. Then, the
   assay was applied to 81 single-sporangiophore isolates of P. viticola
   collected from 10 geographically distinct vineyards in western New York,
   providing a baseline distribution of sensitivities within this
   population. For disease incidence, individual EDS, values ranged from
   0.05 to 0.94 mu g/ml (mean 0.40 mu g/ml), whereas for disease severity
   they ranged from 0.04 to 0.78 mu g/ml (mean 0.24 mu g/ml). When 61 of
   these isolates were similarly tested at a single discriminatory dose of
   0.50 mu g/ml, azoxystrobin provided 61\% control of disease incidence
   versus 41 and 1.1\% control for trifloxystrobin and kresoxim-methyl,
   respectively; for disease severity (colony diameter), azoxystrobin
   provided 80\% control versus 57 and 1.1\% control for trifloxystrobin
   and kresoxim-methyl, respectively. These results provide information
   that can be utilized in future monitoring of P. viticola resistance to
   azoxystrobin and indicate differences in the intrinsic activities of the
   three strobilurin fungicides against this pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{A demographic investigation was conducted to assess variation in life
   history of Polymnia canadensis (Asteraceae), a
   geographically-widespread, herbaceous species of deciduous forests in
   eastern North America. During 1985-1994, 23,063 seedlings of P.
   canadensis were monitored at five central Kentucky study sites. Numbers
   at the end were: biennials, 554; triennials, 142; winter annuals, 16;
   monocarpic perennials, 2; tricarpic perennials (three years), 3; and
   dicarpic perennials (some skipped years) that matured in the first year
   of life, 23; in the second year, 60; and in the third year, 9. Weekly
   cohorts of P. canadensis generally exhibited Deevey Type III
   survivorship with highest seedling mortality in summer associated with
   low soil moisture. Wide spatial variation in life history was displayed
   by the fact that fall germination cohorts at dry sites generally had
   greater germination and survivorship than at mesic sites during seedling
   establishment, while the reverse was true for spring cohorts. This led
   to more reproductive individuals in fall germination cohorts than spring
   cohorts at dry sites and generally the opposite case at mesic sites.
   Forest shade in mesic sites caused slower growth and a greater frequency
   of longer-lived reproductive individuals than in open, dry sites, but it
   also resulted in higher survivorship than at dry sites during moderate
   drought. Annual population growth rate averaged across four years was
   not significantly different between a dry site and mesic site,
   indicating that despite forest shade, P. canadensis persisted in the
   mesic site as well as it did in the dry site. Population structure
   varied among years, seasons, and study sites; at two study plots, a
   2-year flowering cycle of mass seeding and senescence persisted for 4
   years. At a smaller scale, there was little difference in survivorship
   between study plots within sites or between quadrats within study plots,
   while in a few instances there were large differences in the number of
   reproductive individuals. Weekly cohorts that germinated early within
   seasonal cohorts had greater number of reproductive individuals than
   later weekly cohorts, but not consistently greater survivorship. Several
   droughts induced temporal variation that was as important as spatial
   variation. During these droughts, the population size of all cohorts
   that germinated prior to the droughts declined to zero at all sites, and
   biennials were the longest lived type of reproductive individuals.
   During drought, Deevey Type I survivorship was prevalent, and lack of
   seed rain led to dependence on persistent seed banks for recruitment in
   some seasonal cohorts.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial pattern defined as the distribution of individuals in space, is
   an important characteristic of forest stands. It provides an insight
   into the allocation of above-and below-ground resources to a tree, as
   well as reflecting,a the stand history, microclimate, and competition
   between different species over time. The spatial arrangement of trees
   carl be described as random, aggregated, or regular with a number of
   statistics existing that characterize the spatial pattern of a given
   tree population. High spatial resolution remote sensing is an obvious
   tool to facilitate the measuring and monitoring of spatial patterns in
   forest stands. Remote sensing imagery provides detailed information
   about forest structure while still allowing large areas of forest to be
   mapped and monitored. The increased availability of high resolution
   imagery coupled with improvements in scene processing and interpretation
   techniques allow additional information, such as texture, to be
   extracted from this type of imagery. In this paper the spatial pattern
   of trees within a forest stand is related to high spatial resolution
   imagery. This relationship is developed using a technique that relates
   scene texture variance to a statistic describing spatial pattern. The
   technique was tested on a number of simulated remote sensing scenes by
   systematically varying the size and spatial distribution of trees using
   a geometric-optical model. Results indicate that it is theoretically
   possible to derive the spatial pattern of trees within a high spatial
   resolution forested scene provided crown size is estimated a priori. It
   is also likely that the coral projected foliage cover of the canopy will
   affect the ability to predict spatial distribution based on texture
   variance. It was concluded that the spatial pattern of trees within a
   scene can play a vital role in the amount and degree of variation
   existing within imagery. It is important to consider the implications of
   these type of relationships when developing variance-based models of
   forest structure. (C) Published by Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.}},

Abstract = {{The largest population of endangered humpback chub Gila cypha inhabits
   the lower Little Colorado River (LCR) and the main-stem Colorado River
   near its confluence with the LCR in Grand Canyon, Arizona. At present,
   fish in both rivers spawn almost exclusively in the LCR. Flows in the
   main-stem Colorado River are regulated by Glen Canyon Dam, and water
   temperature approximates predam winter temperatures year-round. The LCR
   continues to provide a relatively natural hydrograph and seasonal
   warming patterns. Length-weight relationships among adult humpback chub
   from the lower Colorado River basin showed a seasonal pattern of
   declining condition during spring spawning season followed by recovery
   of condition during summer through early winter. Fish from the main stem
   recovered condition more rapidly after reproduction than did fish from
   the LCR and may have benefited from dam-mediated environmental changes.
   Grand Canyon Colorado River fish had the greatest weight at length of
   eight locations sampled in the upper and lower basins. Records since
   1978 indicate a decline in condition of lower basin humpback chub
   coincident with a reported decline in population size in Grand Canyon.
   We recommend increased monitoring of all populations, including
   mark-recapture studies to provide population estimates during the
   spawning season and condition monitoring during October-November to
   determine more subtle changes in fish health.}},

Abstract = {{The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) resource of eastern Canada is impacted
   by acid rain in the Southern Upland (Atlantic Coast) area of Nova
   Scotia. Salmon runs in this area have become extinct in 14 rivers, are
   severely impacted in 20 rivers, and lightly impacted in 15 rivers. Water
   chemistry and fish communities in nine Southern Upland salmon rivers
   were studied from 1982 to 1996 as part of the effort to monitor the
   effects of the emission control programs in Canada and the United
   States. There has been no statistically significant change in total ion
   content of Southern Upland river water, but there was a significant
   decline in sulfate levels that was balanced by an increase in organic
   anions, and declines in calcium and magnesium that were balanced by
   increases in sodium and potassium. A geochemical scenario is proposed to
   account for these chemical changes. River water pH levels showed no
   overall linear trend, but at borderline toxicity sites the year-to-year
   variations in pH were correlated with changes in juvenile salmon
   population densities. Ten fish species were collected, but none showed
   any significant overall time trend in population density. Fish species
   diversity was positively correlated with pH.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the relationship between benthic invertebrates and aquatic
   birds at a newly constructed wetland using an avian exclosure experiment
   combined with counts of aquatic bird use. We measured the standing stock
   biomass of benthic dipterans both inside and outside exclosures.
   Chironomidae was the most abundant dipteran family present. Maximum
   chironomid standing stock biomass per pond ranged from 3.62 to 27.82
   g/m(2) and was comparable to that found in a number of natural systems.
   We monitored the abundance of ten aquatic birds species. Abundances of
   three aquatic bird species {[}American avocet (Recurvirostra americana),
   Wilson's phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), and cinnamon teal (Anas
   cyanoptera)] were significantly correlated with chironomid and total
   dipteran densities. Our experiment, however found no significant effect
   of predation on invertebrate densities.}},

Abstract = {{To further reduce deer-aircraft collisions, a method for observing deer
   on airports at night that does not affect aircraft operations is
   required. We compared the effectiveness of forward-looking infrared
   (FLIR), spotlight, and night vision goggles (NVG) to monitor the
   abundance of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) along a 10-km
   route in Ohio during 12 nights in winter (Jan-Feb) and summer (Jul)
   1997. Numbers of deer observed with FLIR (825 in winter, 570 in summer)
   and spotlight (716 and 445) were similar (P> 0.05); number of deer
   observed with NVG (243 and 152) was less (P<0.05) in winter and summer.
   The FLIR provided the best overall observability of deer of the 3
   devices tested. The FLIR was less affected than spotlights by inclement
   weather and was not obtrusive. Biologists working in suburban areas or
   on airports can use FLIR to detect deer in areas where a spotlight would
   be inappropriate. Under conditions tested, we do not recommend using NVG
   to detect white-tailed deer at night.}},

Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Rattlesnakes are commercially exploited to supply an international trade
   in skins, meal, gall bladders, and curies. Five species are used in 8
   states: western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) in Texas,
   Oklahoma, and New Mexico; eastern diamondback rattlesnakes (C.
   adamanteus) in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia; prairie rattlesnakes (C.
   viridis) in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico; and timber
   rattlesnakes (C. horridus) in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Alabama, and
   Florida. Blacktail rattlesnakes (C. molossus) occasionally appear in the
   trade in New Mexico and Texas. The trade is linked to rattlesnake
   roundups, which are economically important to local communities. We
   estimated that 15\% of the western diamondback and eastern diamondback
   rattlesnakes entering the trade originate from roundups. In the 1990s,
   probably <125,000 rattlesnakes of all species entered the trade yearly.
   Analyses of long-term data from 3 rattlesnake roundups showed variable
   trends in rate of take, number of hunters, and pounds of snakes/hunter.
   Analysis of the take of western diamondback rattlesnakes from 1959 to
   1997 at the roundup at Sweetwater, Texas, showed no long-term trends,
   but was characterized by extreme variability. Body size (snout-vent
   length {[}SVL] and mass) and sex ratios of hunted western diamondback
   rattlesnakes varied significantly by region and through time. These
   differences were probably due more to geographic and temporal variation
   than to the effects of hunting. Rattlesnake harvests of all species were
   male-biased, and a few hunters collected the majority of the take. A
   model of the economic impacts of imposing size restrictions on
   rattlesnake harvests showed that hunters earn 19\% more money when
   restricting take to rattlesnakes >90 cm SVL (size at maturity of most
   females) whereas profit to the industry increased 6\%. Size limits below
   90 cm SVL would minimally impact total take; restricting take to
   rattlesnakes >90 cm SVL would reduce number of immature females by
   almost 50\%. Rattlesnake species differ in susceptibility to
   overexploitation, and research on life-history variation of rattlesnakes
   should be an important management priority. Information also is needed
   on local versus regional impacts of hunting, and monitoring information
   is needed for the entire trade. Rattlesnakes are traded alive, and
   issues relating to the treatment of live rattlesnakes need to be
   considered when developing management plans for North American
   rattlesnakes.}},

Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{The population estimate for greater (Aythya marila) and lesser (Aythya
   affinis) scaup (combined) has declined dramatically since the early
   1980s to record lows in 1998. The 1998 estimate of 3.47 million scaup is
   far below the goal of 6.3 million set in the North American Waterfowl
   Management Plan (NAWMP), causing concern among biologists and hunters.
   We summarize issues of concern, hypotheses for factors contributing to
   the population decline, and research and management needs recommended by
   participants of the Scaup Workshop, held in September 1999. We believe
   that contaminants, lower female survival, and reduced recruitment due to
   changes in food resources or breeding-ground habitats are primary
   factors contributing to the decline. These factors are not mutually
   exclusive but likely interact across seasons. Workshop participants
   identified seven action items. We need to further delineate where
   declines in breeding populations have occurred, with a primary focus on
   the western Canadian boreal forest, where declines appear to be most
   pronounced. Productivity in various areas and habitats throughout the
   breeding range needs to be assessed by conducting retrospective analyses
   of existing data and by intensive field studies at broad and local
   scales. Annual and seasonal survival rates need to be determined in
   order to assess the role of harvest or natural mortality. Effects of
   contaminants on reproduction, female body condition, and behavior must
   be investigated. Use, distribution, and role of food resources relative
   to body condition and reproduction need to be examined to better
   understand seasonal dynamics of nutrient reserves and the role in
   reproductive success. Affiliations among breeding, migration, and
   wintering areas must be assessed in order to understand differential
   exposure to harvest or contaminants, and differential reproductive
   success and recruitment. Biologists and agencies need to gather and
   improve information needed to manage greater and lesser scaup
   separately; this includes monitoring the breeding populations of each
   species separately, closer examination of existing data to improve
   surveys and data collection, and re-evaluation of the NAWMP population
   goal. These complex issues will require extensive cooperation and
   communication among many agencies and organizations in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive strategies, growth rates, survival, and their correlates
   with life-history traits are studied in the Savi's pine vole (Microtus
   savii) under both natural and laboratory conditions. 119 reproductive
   events were monitored, 50 out of which came from wild-born females and
   69 came from captive-born females. Fertility rates were nearly identical
   in both males and females. Mean age at first parturition of females
   averaged 72.6+/-12.1 days, and the mean time elapsed between the
   constitution of a given pair and the first partum was 31.5+/-11.5 days.
   The litter size of captive-bred females (2.49+/-0.7; range: 1 to 4) was
   nearly identical to that of the free-ranging females (2.5+/-1.1). The
   newborn sex ratio did not significantly deviate from equality. Litter
   size was independent on season and on number of times that a given pair
   reproduced. Nevertheless, litter size tended to be inversely correlated
   with the length of the interpartum time, and was positively correlated
   with parental age. The size of the litter from which the mother and the
   father of a given litter were generated tended to be positively
   correlated with the litter size produced by them, but only the
   relationship relative to males attained statistical significance.
   Females first gave birth to young at an age between 65 and 99 days.
   Female puberty was attained at 50.2+/-13.1 days, almost the same as male
   puberty (x = 47.2 +/- 11.1 days). Females gave birth to young on average
   once every 29.4 days. The interpartum time was not influenced by either
   female age or male age, but was shorter in spring and winter (wet
   seasons in the Mediterranean bioclimate) than in summer and autumn (dry
   seasons). Mean weight of the juveniles was negatively correlated with
   the litter size. The facts that litter size was constituted by a small
   number of young and that the mean gestation time was relatively
   prolonged suggest that Microtus savii is a K strategist within the
   Microtinae, whereas these rodents are well known to be usually extreme
   r-strategists. In general terms, our data are consistent with those
   coming from other fossorial voles, and suggest that fossorial voles (i)
   give birth to a lesser number of young per litter than above-ground
   active voles, and (ii) have an age at puberty delayed in comparison with
   that of above-ground active voles.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of the present study are to examine if there exists a
   quantitative relationship between lead in urine (Pb-U) and that in blood
   (Pb-B), and also between cadmium in urine (Cd-U) and that in blood
   (Cd-B) among the general populations who are environmentally (and not
   occupationally) exposed to these elements at various levels. For this
   purpose, peripheral blood and morning spot urine samples were collected
   in 1991-1998 from approximately 50 non-smoking adult women each in four
   cities in south-east Asia and five cities in mainland China, and two
   cities each in Japan and Korea. The samples were wet-ashed and then
   analyzed by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry for Pb-B, Cd-B,
   Pb-U and Cd-U. Measured values were subjected to analysis to detect
   possible correlation between the pairs of parameters. A significant
   correlation between Pb-B and Pb-U was observed when the intensity of Pb
   exposure (as expressed by Pb-B) was relatively high so that the
   correlation was significant in all cases studied when Pb-B level was,
   e.g. 50 mu g/l or above. It was also observed that the correlation
   between Cd-B and Cd-U was significant when Cd-B was, e.g. > 1 mu g/l.
   Thus, it is possible to deduce that, in environmental health, Pb-B and
   Cd-U levels can be estimated on a group basis from Pb-U and Cd-B,
   respectively, when Pb and Cd exposure levels are relatively high, e.g.
   with Pb-B and Cd-B of > 50 mu g/l and > 1 mu g/l. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Predictions about sex-specific, spatial density-dependent dispersal and
   their demographic and genetic consequences were rested in experimental
   populations of root voles (Microtus oeconomus). Each population
   consisted of two demes inhabiting equal-sized habitat patches imbedded
   in a barren matrix area. We used a neutral two-allele allozyme marker to
   monitor gene flow. Initially, the two demes were genetically distinct
   and had different densities so that the size of a high-density deme
   (genotype bb) was four rimes larger than that of a low-density deme
   (genotype aa). The sex-specific dispersal pattern was in accordance with
   our prediction. Male dispersal was unconditional on deme-specific
   densities, and the majority of the first-generation males became
   dispersed from both demes, whereas female dispersal was strongly density
   dependent, so that dispersal took place exclusively from the
   high-density to the low-density deme. The demographic implication of
   this dispersal pattern was that the initial density difference between
   the demes was quickly canceled out. We built a mathematical model that
   predicted that the initially rare allele (a) would increase in frequency
   given the dispersal pattern, and this was supported by our experimental
   data. This result relies mostly on the density-independent
   male-dispersal strategy, which presumably stems from inbreeding
   avoidance. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating
   sex-specific dispersal strategies in population genetic models.
   Sex-biased dispersal may act as a deterministic force counteracting the
   tendency for stochastic loss of alleles in small and fragmented
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Males of many fruit fly species (Diptera: Tephritidae) are responsive to
   lures and these are used in modified Steiner traps for the regular
   monitoring of populations of fruit flies. Unfortunately, male lures are
   so attractive to many species of fruit fly that even weekly collections
   can produce catches of many hundreds of flies from a single trap. To
   help facilitate the assessment of trap catches in cases such as this, we
   compared total fly counts from real trap catches with various manual and
   computer-simulated subsamples of those catches. Based on computer
   simulations, subsamples of 75, 100 and 200 flies accurately reflected
   the frequency of different fruit fly species in the original trap catch
   (mean trap catch size = 617.42 +/- 53.72 SD flies, n = 26 weekly trap
   catches). However, based on the Chi-squared analysis, subsample sizes of
   less than 200 individuals run the risk of being statistically
   unreliable. Subsamples based on weight were found to be just as accurate
   as subsamples where flies were drawn individually from the parent sample
   and thus offer a rapid method of producing accurate subsamples. Rare
   species were not well represented at any of the three subsample sizes
   and if the abject of a program is to record rare species, then
   subsampling is not recommended. Where abundant species are the focus of
   a trapping program, subsampling offers a statistically reliable and time
   saving approach for assessing trap-catch.}},

Abstract = {{Cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii, may be more troublesome in transgenic
   (Ingard(R)) cotton, because an overall reduction in pesticide use in
   transgenic cotton for the control of pests such as Helicoverpa spp.,
   gives reduced control of concurrent aphids. Additionally, coincidental
   cotton aphid in conventional cotton is being exposed to an increasing
   number of organophosphate insecticides targeted against Helicoverpa spp.
   Resultant insecticide sprays targeted specifically at cotton aphid, are
   likely to increase and-must be managed to maintain insecticide
   susceptibility. As a first step to studying resistance in cotton aphid,
   two strains were collected from unsprayed sources and tested against 21
   registered or experimental insecticides by laboratory bioassay, to
   establish baseline data for resistance monitoring. The LC99.9 of the
   more susceptible strain was used arbitrarily as a discriminating
   concentration to detect resistance in three populations of cotton aphid
   collected in cotton growing districts of New South Wales. In contrast to
   overseas studies, our results suggest that Australian cotton aphid was
   resistant to endosulfan and pyrethroids but not to carbamates or
   organophosphates.}},

Abstract = {{The yacare caiman (Caiman c. yacare) was illegally hunted in the
   Pantanal during the 1970s and 1980s at levels that may have reached one
   million skins per year. The possibility that yacare caiman had been
   over-exploited generated pressure for a monitoring programme for caiman
   populations. The marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) and pampas deer
   (Ozotocerus bezoarticus) are listed as endangered in Brazil and need the
   protection of effective management programmes. Ground surveys are
   difficult for the extensive and inaccessible Pantanal Wetland,
   south-western Brazil, but aerial surveys provided information that
   allowed re-evaluation of conservation priorities. Caiman and marsh deer
   have larger populations than was believed. Preliminary data indicates
   that the pampas deer density decreased at a rate of about 30\% per year
   from 1991 to 1993. This indicates the need for detailed ground-level
   studies for the pampas deer population in the Pantanal. We recommend a
   long term monitoring program using standardized counting procedures for
   wildlife populations in the Pantanal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{One of the key factors affecting the integrity of forest ecosystems in
   portions of the eastern United States is heavy browsing by overabundant
   populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman).
   Deer impacts to upland forests of the Allegheny Plateau in northwestern
   PA, USA, have been especially intense: high levels of deer browsing over
   the past 60 years have strongly influenced forest pattern and process.
   Riparian forests of the region are rich in herbaceous plant species, but
   virtually nothing is known about how deer browsing may influence the
   structure and function of these systems. Moreover, reliable techniques
   for assessing and monitoring deer impacts on riparian forests are
   lacking. The goal of this study was to determine whether the common
   riparian herbaceous plant turtlehead, Chelone glabra L., is a useful
   indicator species with which to assess and monitor the intensity of deer
   browsing in the herbaceous layer of Allegheny Plateau riparian forests.
   The percentage of C. glabra stems browsed by deer was significantly
   correlated with intensity of browsing on the herbaceous community during
   one sample period, but stem height, an attribute used widely in other
   studies of browse indicator species, was poorly correlated with
   intensity of browsing. Three other herbaceous plant species, Aster
   divaricatus L., A. prenanthoides Muhl. and Impatiens capensis Meerb.,
   were preferentially browsed by deer and show promise for use as
   indicators of browsing intensity in riparian forests. Variability in
   deer browsing intensity on C. glabra across sites and sample periods
   suggests that use of an assemblage of herbaceous browse indicator
   species is preferable to sole reliance on C. glabra for assessing and
   monitoring browsing impact. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Seasonal variations in photoperiod, temperature, and population density
   have been shown to modulate immune responsiveness of animals in
   laboratory studies. To examine these associations under natural
   conditions, we monitored 3 populations of prairie voles (Microtus
   ochrogaster) for temporal variations in selected immunological
   parameters, population density, and survival rate from winter 1996 to
   spring 1997. Spontaneous and cytokine-stimulated T-cell proliferative
   responsiveness of prairie voles peaked in winter and declined in spring.
   Relative organ mass, hemolytic-complement activity, and in vivo
   hypersensitivity responses varied temporally but showed no clear
   seasonal trend. The population density and survival rate of all 3
   prairie vole populations varied temporally and correlated with measures
   of immunity. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the model
   containing relative spleen mass, cytokine-stimulated T-cell
   proliferation, and in vivo hypersensitivity explained a significant
   amount of variability in population density, while cytokine-stimulated
   T-cell proliferation and relative thymus mass explained a significant
   amount of variability in survival rate. The results suggest that
   seasonal environmental changes can enhance immune responsiveness of a
   host and may counteract the immunoenhancing effects of photoperiod in
   wild populations of prairie voles. Our results also suggest that there
   is an association between immune function and demography in wild
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Skates are arguably the most vulnerable of exploited marine fishes.
   Their vulnerability is often assessed by examining fisheries catch
   trends, but these data are not generally recorded on a species basis
   except in France. Aggregated skate catch statistics tend to exhibit more
   stable trends than those of other elasmobranch fisheries. We tested
   whether such apparent stability in aggregated catch trends could mask
   population declines of individual species. We examined two time series
   of species-specific surveys of a relatively stable skate fishery in the
   norhteast Atlantic. These surveys revealed the disappearance of two
   skate species, long-nose skate (Dipturus oxyrhinchus) and white skate
   (Rostroraja alba) and confirmed a previously documented decline of the
   common skate (D. batis). Of the remaining five skate species, the three
   larger ones have declined, whereas two smaller species have increased in
   abundance. The increase in abundance and biomass of the smaller species
   has resulted in the stability of the aggregated catch trends. Because
   there is significant dietary overlap among species, we suggest the
   increase in abundance of the smaller species may be due to competitive
   release as the larger species declined. A consequence of this kind of
   stability is that declining species cannot be detected without
   species-specific data, especially in taxa exhibiting competitive
   interactions. This may explain why previously documented disappearances
   of two species of skates went unnoticed for so long. The conservation of
   skates and other elasmobranchs requires species-specific monitoring and
   special attention to larger species.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial habitat is often created to augment populations of
   commercially valuable species. The complex structure of the habitat
   provides refuge from predation. In Grays Harbor, Washington, this
   concept is being applied by constructing intertidal oyster shell plots
   for megalopae settlement of Dungeness crab (Cancer magister). Previous
   monitoring of these plots revealed a negative relationship between shore
   crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis, densities and C. magister juveniles
   within the shell plots. The present study investigated the settlement of
   C. magister in the presence of Hemigrapsus. We also explored the ability
   of Hemigrapsus to prey on juvenile C. magister instars. C. magister
   megalopae avoided Hemigrapsus, whose presence was detected chemically,
   not visually. Results support the hypothesis that C. magister megalopae
   avoid Hemigrapsus when selecting areas to settle. Hemigrapsus predation
   upon juvenile C. magister, with carapace width of approximately 8 mm,
   begins to occur when the Hemigrapsus are approximately 1.5 times the
   size of the C. magister. Predation on C. magister early instars
   increases as the size ratio (C. magister: Hemigrapsus) decreases.}},

Abstract = {{Epichloe fungi interact with Botanophila flies in a co-evolved mutualism
   that appears to be analogous to angiosperm pollinator-parasite systems.
   Female flies act as vectors of fungal sports as they lay eggs on the
   fungi which grow within and on grass stems. To understand selective
   pressures operating on choice of host Fungi by flies, we monitored the
   interaction of two species of Epichloe with Botanophila at two sites in
   southern England. At one site (Ashurst), the hosts Epichloe clarkii and
   Epichloe boconii co-occurred, while at a second site (Farm Gate), only
   E. clarkii was present. Flies ovipositing on E. baconii showed
   preferences for large, somewhat isolated fungi occurring within small
   clumps of grass. Flies ovipositing on E. clarkii at the Ashurst site did
   not select hosts based on any physical features of fungi that we
   measured. However, flies ovipositing on E. clarkii at the Farm Gate site
   tended to prefer large fungi that occurred within small clumps of grass.
   Fungal characteristics preferred by the flies showed no correlation with
   egg/larval survivorship. Insect survival on E. clarkii varied between
   sites and was related to differences in egg dispersion among fungi at
   the two sires. The absence of an alternate host (E. baconii) was
   associated with greater aggregation of eggs on E. clarkii at the Farm
   Gate site and these insects experienced higher levels of mortality at
   this compared to the other site.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in molecular biology offer promise to the study of demographic
   characteristics of rare or hard-re-capture species, because individuals
   can now be identified through noninvasive sampling such as fecal
   collection or hair snags. However, individual genotyping using such
   methods currently leads to a novel problem that we call a ``shadow
   effect,{''} because some animals not captured previously are believed to
   be recaptures due to their DNA profile being an indistinguishable shadow
   of previously captured animals. We evaluate the impact of the shadow
   effect on the two methods most commonly used in applied population
   ecology to estimate the size of closed populations: Lincoln-Petersen and
   multiple-recapture estimators in program CAPTURE. We find that the
   shadow effect can cause a negative bias in the estimates of both the
   number of different animals and the number of different genotypes.
   Furthermore, with Lincoln-Petersen estimators, the shadow effect can
   cause estimated confidence intervals to decrease even as bias increases.
   Because the bias arises from heterogeneity in apparent ``capture{''}
   probabilities for animals with genetic shadows vs. those without, a
   model in program CAPTURE that is robust to capture heterogeneity
   (Mh-jackknife) does not underestimate the number of genotypes in the
   population and only slightly underestimates the rotal number of
   individuals As the shadow effect increases, CAPTURE is better able to
   correctly identify heterogeneity in capture probability and to pick
   Mh-jackknife, so that the higher levels of shadow effect have less bias
   than medium levels. The shadow effect will occur in all estimates of
   demographic rates (including survival) that use DNA sampling to
   determine individual identity, but it can be minimized by increasing the
   number of individual loci sampled.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the interspecific reproductive synchrony of Dipterocarpaceae
   with vertebrate responses to seed availablity, we monitored the
   spatiotemporal distribution and phenology of more than 2367 adult
   dipterocarp individuals of 54 species from March 1985 to January 1993 in
   the Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seven
   vegetational formations were sampled along an altitudinal gradient from
   peat swamp forest (5 m a.s.l. {[}above sea level]) across lowlands to
   upper montane zones (1100 m a.s.l.) that encompassed two upland valley
   complexes in a 15-km(2) area. Four significant reproductive events were
   documented: (1) a common lowland species reproduced outside of mast
   events in 1986 and in 1990; (2) a localized lowland ``minor{''} mast
   event in 1986 in which 24.3\% of the adult trees (21 spp.) participated;
   (3) a major community-wide mast event (92.8\%, 48 spp.) in 1987, just 6
   mo after the minor event; and (4) another major community-wide mast
   fruiting event after a 4-yr intermast interval (88\%, 48 spp.) in 1991.
   West Kalimantan export records of illipe nut (Dipterocarpaceae: Shorea
   section Pachycarpae) from 1968 to 1997 were compiled as a baseline
   measure of the frequency and relative intensity of dipterocarp
   mast-fruiting events in the region (cv = 152\%). A ``bumper crop{''}
   occurred about every 5 +/- 2.6 yr (mean +/- 1 so; range 3-9 yr). Fruit
   production was significantly associated with Fl Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) events. The 1987 and 1991 mast events monitored were
   the third and fourth largest export years in the province since 1968.
   Because of the disputed role of vertebrate seed predators in causing and
   maintaining mast-fruiting behavior the response of seed-eating
   vertebrates tn this spatiotemporal variation in dipterocarp seed
   production was examined. Seed of a common, but asynchronous, lowland
   species was largely consumed by vertebrates. In the 1986 minor mast, 21
   dipterocarp species that produced 60 000 seeds/ha (dry mass 46 kg/ha)
   lost all monitored viable seed to a diversity of resident and nomadic
   vertebrate seed predators. Timed with dipterocarp seed production in all
   mast events, nomadic vertebrates increased their populations through
   both reproduction and regional movement (numerical response). However,
   in both the 1987 and 1991 mast events, resident vertebrates destroyed
   only 1.5\% and 2.6\% of community seed production, and predation was
   recorded only in the tails of the fruit-fall distribution. During these
   community mast events, resident vertebrates switched from dipterocarp
   geed to feed on fruit and seed from other available species. Nomadic
   vertebrates arrived late in the fruit-fall period during both major mast
   events and, thus, were able to destroy only seed dispersed in the final
   1-3 wk of fruit-fall. Seed escape, and thus regeneration, only occurred
   in major mast events when all dipterocarp species across large areas
   participated. Considerable seedling recruitment was recorded in both the
   1987 (similar to 95 000 seedlings/ha) and 1991 (155 824 +/- 36 764
   seedlings/ha) mast events.
   Results from this natural experiment indicate that resident and nomadic
   vertebrates cause stabilizing selection for tight interspecific
   synchrony of dipterocarp seedfall over vast regions. Although the
   pattern generally conformed to the predator-satiation hypothesis, the
   observed mechanisms for seed escape within a mast-fruiting event did
   not. Resident and nomadic vertebrate foraging and ranging patterns
   resulted in dipterocarp seed ``escape{''} rather than local
   ``swamping{''} with copious seed production per se. To account for these
   observations, two hypotheses, ``interfamilial satiation{''} and
   ``regional escape,{''} were developed. The period of seed availability
   and length of the regional intermast interval is examined with
   seed-predator reproduction and behavior to assess the impact of seed
   availability on seed-predator populations. The importance of rare events
   and appropriate spatial scale for investigating evolutionary and
   ecological processes such as mast fruiting are addressed.}},

Abstract = {{We documented patterns of surface heating associated with chaparral fire
   to characterize fundamental scale variation in the intensity of this
   stand-replacing disturbance. To test how this variation may influence
   community structure, we studied its effect on the soil seed bank and the
   distribution of seedlings and resprouts that emerged after fire. To
   evaluate the long-term significance of initial patterns, we monitored
   vegetation development for 4-5 yr, thereby encompassing the dynamic
   portion of the chaparral fire cycle.
   We studied two stands on level uniform terrain before, during, and after
   fall fires. Stands were dominated by chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum),
   a postfire seeder/sprouter. Nonsprouting Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus
   spp. were also present. Preburn vegetation, seed populations, soil
   heating, and postburn plant growth were analyzed along transects of
   contiguous 1-m(2) plots, so that we could block them together
   incrementally to identify scale dependence of patterns. In addition, we
   directly compared heating effects under the fuel array with those just
   outside by establishing plots in canopy gaps, under the adjacent canopy,
   and in gaps created and eliminated by reciprocally translocating fuel.
   Pre- and postburn seed populations were estimated in soil samples
   collected from all plots. The proportion of seed that survived above and
   below 2.5 cm in the soil was determined in a subset of plots.
   The amount and distribution of canopy fuel that collapsed during fire
   and smoldered on the ground caused pronounced spatial variation in total
   surface heating. The strength of relationships among patterns of soil
   heating, preburn canopy, surviving seeds, and seedlings and herbaceous
   resprouts was consistently most pronounced in blocks 3-5 m long. At this
   scale, postburn patterns were strongly negatively associated with the
   amount of preburn canopy and the pattern of soil heating this fuel
   created. Seedlings or herbaceous resprouts of numerous species were
   abundant where soil heating was relatively low, most notably in natural
   and created canopy gaps. Conversely, areas where dense canopy occurred
   before fire, especially gaps displaced by fuel addition, were barren
   except for occasional Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus seedlings. These
   obligate postfire seeders, along with the subshrub Helianthemum
   scoparium, had more deeply buried seeds, and some of them were able to
   survive where soil heating was prolonged. However, Helianthemum did not
   emerge from depth. Seedlings of Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus nearest
   Adenostoma burls survived significantly better when Adenostoma failed to
   resprout. This wan common in one burn where heating was relatively high
   and burl size was small. Seed mortality prevented Adenostoma seedling
   emergence from occurring where its seeds were most abundant prior to
   fire, which was in proximity to its burls. Adenostoma seedlings did
   emerge in areas of lower soil heating, but their survival was inversely
   related to the density of Helianthemum seedlings. No shrub seedlings
   emerged after the first year following fire because their seed banks
   were exhausted by fire-induced mortality and/or germination. After 4-5
   yr, few young Adenostoma remained. The combination of seedling and
   resprout regeneration allowed this shrub to maintain dominance, but to a
   lesser extent in the older stand.
   Our results support a vegetation pattern-process model in which local
   species distributions after fire in Adenostoma chaparral are
   antecedently linked to the physical and chemical properties of the
   canopy. These control the nature of combustion, the soil heating that

Abstract = {{The suppressive effects of undersown clover on Thrips tabaci Lindeman
   infestation in leek is known but not the stages in thrips population
   dynamics that are affected by intercropping and the mechanisms involved.
   Colonization or settling of adult onion thrips (T. tabaci) in
   monocropped leek (Allium porrum L.) and in leek intercropped with
   strawberry clover (Trifolium fragiferum L.) was studied in two potted
   plant experiments. Potted leek plants with and without undersown clover
   were placed for a short period (2 and 5 days) in monocropped or
   intercropped field plots when high thrips infestation was expected.
   Thrips adults were counted on all leaves and in the shaft during this
   observation period. Thrips populations were monitored weekly in the
   field plots throughout the entire growing season.
   In both potted plant experiments, there were consistently fewer thrips
   adults on intercropped leek plants than on monocropped plants. The plant
   growth parameters - number of leaves and stem diameter - were similar in
   all treatments and thus did not explain differences in thrips adults.
   Natural enemies were absent on both leek and clover, and thus cannot
   explain the differences in adult thrips numbers. Furthermore, no adults
   of T. tabaci were found on the clover in the potted plant experiment and
   only very few in the field experiment. Thus it was concluded that
   strawberry clover was not an effective trap crop for thrips.
   In the second potted plant experiment, clover was removed just before
   the leek plants were introduced to the field, thus eliminating direct
   physical, visual and olfactory interference by clover. After the
   undersown clover was removed, the leek plants harboured only one-third
   of the number of thrips adults, as compared to the monocropped plants.
   This study supports the notion that there are subtle links between
   intercropping and plant quality, and indicates that host-plant quality
   is an underlying cause of the reduction in adult thrips numbers in
   leek/clover intercropping.}},

Abstract = {{Correlations between marine habitat degradation and the prevalence of
   abnormalities and diseases in populations can provide a starting point
   for understanding the effects of changes in environmental conditions on
   marine organisms. The present study characterized the features of scale
   disorientation (SD), a common morphological anomaly encountered in
   pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides, in Biscayne Bay, Florida (U.S.A.). Scale
   disorientation consisted of discrete patches of scales rotated dorsally
   or ventrally away from the normal scale position without any projection
   of the scales outwards from the body surface. The direction of scale
   growth within the patches varied from normal to a minor misalignment to
   a complete reversal of direction. The severity of SD, defined as the
   percentage of body surface area affected, varied from 1 to 34\% with a
   mean of 9.3\%. Affected fish monitored in the laboratory demonstrated a
   proportional growth of SD areas such that the percentage of body surface
   affected did not change as the fish grew. Scale disorientation was more
   prevalent in the northern region of the bay, an area known to be more
   contaminated. Scales from SD areas exhibited significantly abnormal
   morphology with larger average focus diameter, smaller size, more
   elongate shape and fewer radii relative to normal scales. Experimental
   removal of scales demonstrated that normal scales regrew in normal
   orientation and morphology while those from SD areas regrew in abnormal
   orientations and morphologies. Experiments in which fish were exposed to
   acute and chronic injuries indicated that these physical traumas were
   insufficient to directly induce formation of scale disorientations
   typical of those seen in the wild. Observations of pinfish in the
   laboratory revealed that SD areas can appear spontaneously in normal
   juvenile and adult fish. These new SD areas developed relatively
   rapidly, did not require prior scale loss and remained stable in size
   after first appearance. Although the etiology of SD remains unknown, the
   significant difference in prevalence of this syndrome between regions of
   Biscayne Bay having different levels of sediment contaminants suggests
   that environmental factors may be important in development of SD.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested the hypothesis, suggested by several recent reports,
   that air pollution may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes. This
   study analyzed all singleton live births registered by the Czech
   national birth register in 1991 in 67 districts where at least one
   pollutant was monitored in 1990-1991 (n = 108,173). Maternal exposures
   to sulfur dioxide (SO2), total suspended particles (TSP), and nitrous
   oxides (NOx) in each trimester of pregnancy were estimated as the
   arithmetic means of all daily measurements taken by all monitors in the
   district of birth of each infant. Odds ratios of low birth weight (<
   2,500 g), prematurity (< 37 weeks of gestation), and intrauterine growth
   retardation (IUGR; < 10th percentile of birth weight for gestational age
   and sex) were estimated by robust logistic regression. The median land
   25th and 75th percentile) trimester exposures were 32 (18, 56) mu g/m(3)
   for SO2; 72 (55, 87) mu g/m(3) for TSP; and 38 (23, 53) mu g/m(3) for
   NOx. Low birth weight (prevalence 5.2\%) and prematurity (prevalence
   4.8\%) were associated with SO, and somewhat less strongly with TSP.
   IUGR was not associated with any pollutant. The effects on low birth
   weight and prematurity were marginally stronger for exposures in the
   first trimester, and were not attenuated at all by adjustment for
   socioeconomic factors or the month of birth. Adjusted odds ratios of low
   birth weight were 1.20 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.30] and
   1.15 (CI, 1.07-1.24) for a 50 mu g/m(3) increase in SO2 and TSP,
   respectively, in the first trimester; adjusted odds ratios of
   prematurity were 1.27 (CI, 1.16-1.39) and 1.18 (CI, 1.05-1.31) for a 50
   mu g/m(3) increase in SO2 and TSP, respectively, in the first trimester.
   Low gestational age accounted for the association between SO2 and low
   birth weight. These Endings provide further support for the hypothesis
   that air pollution can affect the outcome of pregnancy.}},

Title = {{Nutrient retention by benthic macrofaunal biomass of Danish estuaries:
   Importance of nutrient load and residence time}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{The response of macrobenthic faunal abundance and biomass to nutrient
   load, and factors that may modify this response are examined by means of
   inter-estuary comparisons of 14 shallow Danish estuaries. Data for this
   analysis are the physicochemical and biological variables monitored by
   local authorities mainly during the period 1989-95. A clear positive
   effect of nutrient load is demonstrated on benthic biomass, over a wide
   range of total N-load as the model substance from 2-200 g m(-2)
   year(-1). The relationship was curvilinear with a levelling off or even
   depression of biomass at high total N-load (above c. 35 g m(-2)
   year(-1)). A mixed chemostat model using total load and hydraulic
   residence time for estuaries was applied to estimate the load that could
   be realized into primary production, and consequently enter into benthic
   production. Two measures, the load corrected for winter export (the
   realized N-load) and the nutrient pool available for the spring bloom
   (SBNP) were calculated. The benthic metabolic demand inferred from
   biomass, assuming an annual P:B ratio of I (P, secondary production; B,
   benthic biomass), was approximately of the same magnitude as both total
   N-load and realized N-load. A positive correlation was still found
   between benthic biomass/production and the realized N-load, but the
   linearity of the regression between them was not improved compared to
   the corresponding relationship with total load. The best linearly
   proportional relationship was obtained with the spring bloom N-pool
   (SBNP) calculated from the chemostat model. Stoichiometry suggested,
   however, that the spring bloom is of little importance for supporting
   benthic standing stock in these well flushed estuaries. To explain the
   strong statistical relationship, despite poor causality, with SBNP, it
   is suggested that the algorithm behind SBNP reflects the ability of the
   estuary to retain nutrients in the water mass in the productive period,
   both as free molecules and included into biological particles. These
   findings strongly indicate that benthic standing stock system-wide is
   food limited and indicate the importance of interaction between loading
   and estuary residence rime (flushing) for the outcome of eutrophication.
   The findings are in agreement with reports that high estuary flushing
   rate may modify effects of eutrophication, and they deviate from
   previous studies in shallow coastal areas reporting either no effect, or
   negative effects, of eutrophication on benthic biomass. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Sexual selection (defined as the change in genotypic or phenotypic
   frequencies of mated versus total population frequencies) and sexual
   isolation (defined as the deviation from random mating in mated
   individuals) show different evolutionary consequences and partially
   confounded causes. Traditionally, the cross-product estimator has been
   used to quantify sexual selection, whereas a variety of indexes, such as
   Yule V, Yule a YA, joint I, and others have been used to quantify sexual
   isolation. Because the two types of estimators use different scales, the
   effects of both processes cannot be monitored simultaneously. We
   describe three new related statistics that quantify both sexual
   selection (PSS) and sexual isolation (PSI) effects for every mating pair
   combination in polymorphic traits, as well as measure their combined
   effects (PTI = PSI x PSS). The new statistics have the advantage of
   providing information on every mating pair combination, quantifying the
   effects of sexual selection and isolation in the same units, and
   detecting asymmetry in sexual isolation. The ability of the new
   statistics to ascertain the biological causes of sexual selection and
   sexual isolation are investigated under different models involving
   distinct marginal frequencies, mate propensity, and mate choice
   coefficients. We also studied the use of classical isolation indexes
   applied on PSI coefficients, instead of on raw data. The use of the
   classical indexes applied to PSI coefficients considerably reduces the
   statistical bias of the estimates, revealing the good estimation
   properties of the new statistics.}},

Abstract = {{1. The seasonal variations of protist and rotifer populations were
   monitored over 1 year in a small artificial pond. Grazing rates on
   fluorescently labelled bacteria were also determined.
   2. The data showed population dynamics similar to other small freshwater
   bodies; diatoms were numerous during the spring, chlorophytes dominated
   during the summer months, and mixotrophs, in particular Gymnodinium,
   dominated during the autumn and winter.
   3. The mixotrophic dinoflagellates were responsible for a high
   chlorophyll concentration during the autumn and winter. Mixotrophs were
   important consumers of bacteria, particularly during the autumn when
   population densities of pure heterotrophs were low. Mixotrophs were an
   important component of the microbial food web in this pond.}},

Title = {{Effects of surgically imposed sterility on free-ranging rabbit
   populations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{16-39}},

Abstract = {{1. Demographic changes in response to surgically imposed female
   sterility were monitored in 12 free-ranging rabbit populations in
   south-western Australia over a 4-year period. This was part of a
   research programme aimed at examining the potential for virally vectored
   immunocontraception to limit the abundance of rabbits (e.g. using a
   recombinant myxoma virus) and other mammalian pests. Sterility levels
   were 0\%, 40\%, 60\% and 80\% of all females in year 1, with a similar
   proportion of female recruits sterilized surgically in subsequent years.
   2. There was a significant decrease in rabbit productivity with
   increasing sterility level. This was overcome by increased survival of
   kittens and adults on the high-sterility sites, such that the base-level
   numbers of rabbits were maintained, and mean annual rates of increase
   (r) were near zero for all treatments in all years. However, in the
   high-sterility populations this compensation was insufficient to
   overcome the effects of sterility totally, and there was a marked
   decrease in the seasonal peaks in rabbit abundance for these treatments.
   3. Survival and recruitment were dependent upon the level of sterility,
   and consequently the density of rabbits, with greatest survival of adult
   rabbits occurring on the 80\% sites. Survival of sterile females was
   greater than that of other adults, probably because of their increased
   ability to maintain body condition during times of low pasture biomass
   (summer drought). Thus two density-dependent processes were identified:
   the first was operating through increased survival of juvenile rabbits,
   the second through increased adult survival, particularly sterilized
   females.
   4. Because the proportional impact of immigration was greater (i.e.
   immigrants constituted a greater proportion of the population) and
   emigration was less, from the 80\% sites, the effects of sterility may
   have been underestimated on these sites.
   5. The abundance of European rabbit fleas, a vector of myxomatosis, was
   significantly lower on the 80\% sites, but this did not appear to affect
   the transmission of myxoma. Myxomatosis occurred as an annual epizootic
   in three of four years, with > 90\% of rabbits on site after each
   epizootic testing positive for myxoma antibodies.
   6. To achieve a sustained long-term reduction in rabbit abundance,
   60-80\% of female rabbits would need to be prevented from breeding. This
   could be achieved by a recombinant strain of myxoma provided the strain
   retained good transmissibility and all infected rabbits became sterile
   for life.}},

   Ochrogaster lunifer: lessons for conservation and pest management}},

Abstract = {{1. The spatial and temporal distribution of eggs laid by herbivorous
   insects is a crucial component of herbivore population stability, as it
   influences overall mortality within the population. Thus an ecologist
   studying populations of an endangered butterfly can do little to
   increase its numbers through habitat management without knowledge of its
   egg-laying patterns across individual host-plants under different
   habitat management regimes. At the other end of the spectrum, a
   knowledge of egg-laying behaviour can do much to control pest outbreaks
   by disrupting egg distributions that lead to rapid population growth.
   2. The distribution of egg batches of the processionary caterpillar
   Ochrogaster lunifer on acacia trees was monitored in 21 habitats during
   2 years in coastal Australia. The presence of egg batches on acacias was
   affected by host-tree `quality' (tree size and foliar chemistry that led
   to increased caterpillar survival) and host-tree `apparency' (the amount
   of vegetation surrounding host-trees).
   3. In open homogeneous habitats, more egg batches were laid on
   high-quality trees, increasing potential population growth. In diverse
   mixed-species habitats, more egg batches were laid on low-quality highly
   apparent trees, reducing population growth and so reducing the potential
   for unstable population dynamics. The aggregation of batches on small
   apparent trees in diverse habitats led to outbreaks on these trees year
   after year, even when population levels were low, while site-wide
   outbreaks were rare.
   4. These results predict that diverse habitats with mixed plant species
   should increase insect aggregation and increase population stability. In
   contrast, in open disturbed habitats or in regular plantations, where
   egg batches are more evenly distributed across high-quality hosts,
   populations should be more unstable, with site-wide outbreaks and
   extinctions being more common.
   5. Mixed planting should be used on habitat regeneration sites to
   increase the population stability of immigrating or reintroduced insect
   species. Mixed planting also increases the diversity of resources,
   leading to higher herbivore species richness. With regard to the
   conservation of single species, different practices of habitat
   management will need to be employed depending on whether a project is
   concerned with methods of rapidly increasing the abundance of an
   endangered insect or concerned with the maintenance of a stable,
   established insect population that is perhaps endemic to an area.
   Suggestions for habitat management in these different cases are
   discussed.
   6. Finally, intercropping can be highly effective in reducing pest
   outbreaks, although the economic gains of reduced pest attack may be
   outweighed by reduced crop yields in mixed-crop systems.}},

Abstract = {{1. Changes in agriculture have been linked to widespread declines in
   farmland bird populations. One approach to the identification of the
   causes of observed population changes is to investigate historical
   changes in national demographic rates.
   2. We analysed the British Trust for Ornithology's nest records database
   to investigate whether long-term farmland population trends could have
   been driven by changes in several components of the annual breeding
   performance of 12 granivorous bird species. Clutch size, brood size,
   chick : egg ratio and daily nest failure rates were analysed with
   respect to blocks of years during which abundance (as measured by the
   Common Birds Census) was increasing, stable or declining. The individual
   components of breeding performance were combined to provide estimates of
   the production of fledglings per breeding attempt.
   3. Most species' population declines were not associated with poor
   breeding performance per attempt. Effects of environmental change on
   this parameter therefore cannot be a general mechanism behind the major
   population declines seen.
   4. A fall in linnet Carduelis cannabina fledgling production per
   attempt, driven primarily by increased nest failure rates during the egg
   period, represented the strongest evidence for an important effect of
   breeding performance on abundance. This change could have driven the
   principal population decline (1975-86) for this species.
   5. Conversely, at least for the declining turtle dove Streptopelia
   turtur, skylark Alauda arvensis, tree sparrow Passer montanus,
   yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and corn bunting Miliaria calandra,
   breeding performance per attempt was higher while populations declined.
   6. Variation in annual survival and fledgling production per breeding
   attempt alone could not explain changes in abundance for at least seven
   species. This may suggest that changes in post-fledging survival rates
   and/or the number of breeding attempts per year could have been
   important.
   7. Management to improve over-winter survival may be critical in
   reversing the population trends of most declining species, but such
   management might still best be directed at the breeding season.
   Post-fledging survival rates and the number of breeding attempts made
   within a season are little-studied demographic variables that are high
   priorities for future research and long-term monitoring.}},

Title = {{Can population surveys show if the Mediterranean monk seal colony at Cap
   Blanc is declining in abundance?}},

Abstract = {{1. The Mediterranean monk seal is an endangered marine mammal with only
   a few populations thought to be viable. The largest aggregation of this
   species is found at the Peninsula of Cap Blanc, on the western Sahara,
   where a colonial structure is maintained. The size of this colony is
   estimated by annual capture-recapture surveys, but it is unclear if the
   attained level of precision is enough to detect changes in numbers in
   the short term.
   2. In this study, simulated capture-recapture experiments were used to
   investigate the relationship between population estimates and abundance.
   The statistical power necessary to detect a population decline with
   ongoing surveys was estimated, and the requirements for an improvement
   in precision were evaluated. Additionally, changes in abundance over
   consecutive surveys were examined for comparison with an alternative
   method of Bayesian inference.
   3. Results indicated that the power to detect trends from the actual
   surveys was lower than should be required for the conservation of a
   small population, such as the colony at Cap Blanc. A 5\% annual rate of
   decline in abundance would only be detected with high power after 12
   years, with a population of 317 seals being reduced to 172. If the
   annual rate of decline was 10\%, 8 years would be required to detect a
   reduction of 317 to 136 seals.
   4. Capture-recapture surveys can produce reliable data but do not
   identify moderate or low population declines. The increase in precision
   of surveys is costly and time consuming, and other monitoring methods
   are needed to detect early signs of a decline. Bayesian methods cannot
   provide a better result because they are not robust to small sample size
   and heterogeneity in capture probabilities. Despite the need for
   alternative methods for earlier detection, capture-recapture surveys are
   still required to estimate the size of the colony, and precision in
   population estimates can be evaluated in relation to cost effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{1. Termites play a key role in decomposition processes in tropical
   ecosystems. Rapid assessment of local termite assemblages requires a
   standardized sampling protocol capable of producing an accurate picture
   of species composition. This paper evaluates the efficacy of a sampling
   protocol designed to assess termite species richness and functional
   diversity in tropical forests.
   2. The protocol entails a 100 m long transect consisting of 20 sections
   (each 5 x 2 m). One hour of human sampling effort per section is used to
   search for and collect termites from dead wood, soil, termite nests and
   other microhabitats up to a height of 2 m above ground. The protocol was
   tested in three forest sites where the local termite fauna was already
   comprehensively documented. Two transects were run at Danum Valley
   (Sabah, Borneo), one at Pasoh Forest Reserve (Peninsular Malaysia) and
   one at Mbalmayo Forest Reserve (Cameroon).
   3. At the three sites the transect samples contained 31-36\% of the
   known local termite species pool. The taxonomic and functional group
   composition of the transect samples did not differ significantly from
   that of the known local fauna. The two transects run at Danum Valley
   gave very similar patterns, suggesting that the protocol produces
   consistent within-site results. After sampling 20 sections,
   pseudoturnover between the two Danum transects had declined to a
   relatively low level.
   4. The transect method is effective because it utilizes collecting
   expertise within a protocol that standardizes sampling effort and area.
   The protocol provides a much more rapid and cost-effective method for
   studying termite assemblage structure than sampling regimes designed to
   estimate population abundances. It was demonstrated that one supervised
   training transect was sufficient to ensure the protocol was conducted
   with the required level of sampling efficiency.
   5. The protocol offers a rapid tool for investigating spatial and
   temporal patterns of termite assemblage structure in tropical forest
   sites. Existing data also suggest that termites warrant further
   investigation as ecological indicators. Termite assemblage composition
   shows a strong response to habitat disturbance and may be indicative of
   quantitative changes in the decomposition process. The termite transect
   has potential as a useful addition to any suite of organisms recommended
   for monitoring functional processes in tropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{Graphocephala atropunctata (Signoret) is the principal vector of Xylella
   fastidiosa (Wells, Raju, Hung, Weisberg, Mandelco-Paul and Brenner), the
   bacterium that causes Pierce's disease of grapevine in coastal
   California. Monitoring the activity of G. atropunctata in the early
   spring is important for timing insecticide sprays and assessing the
   potential for disease spread to adjacent vineyards. Trapping studies
   with yellow sticky traps over 3 yr in Napa Valley, CA, established a
   significant correlation between early spring trap catch and temperature.
   Sticky trap catches of G. atropunctata occurred in the springs of
   1996-1998 only when temperature was greater than or equal to 14.5
   degrees C. In 1997 and 1998, the degree-hours (>14.5 degrees C) per day
   from sunrise to sunset during March and April, but not in May,
   correlated significantly with trap catches. The temperature threshold of
   14.5 degrees C in the early spring can be used to improve the timing of
   insecticidal applications aimed at reducing G. atropunctata populations
   in vineyards affected by Pierce's disease.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated dispersal patterns of San Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes
   macrotis multica) on the Naval Petroleum Reserves, California. Of 209
   juvenile kit foxes monitored during 1980-1996, 33\% dispersed from their

   dispersed, and dispersal peaked in July. Dispersing males tended to be
   heavier than philopatric males; philopatric females were significantly
   heavier than dispersing females. Expressed as a percentage of all
   juveniles monitored, annual dispersal ranged from 0\% to 79\% for males,
   0\% to 50\% for females, and 0\% to 52\% for all foxes. Percentage of
   male dispersal was related weakly to mean annual litter size (r(2) =
   0.27), and percentage of female dispersal was weakly and inversely
   related to annual indices of small-mammal abundance (r(2) = 0.46). Most
   (65.2\%) dispersing juveniles died within less than or equal to 10 days
   of leaving their natal range. Survival tended to be higher for
   dispersing males than for philopatric males but was similar between
   dispersing and philopatric females. Sixty percent of all foxes that
   survived to breeding age reproduced except among dispersing females,
   none of which reproduced, Alloparental care did not account for
   sex-biased dispersal in kit foxes. Auxiliary adults were observed
   occasionally with mated pairs, but helping behavior was not observed.
   Dispersal patterns of kit foxes may be a function of innate sex-biased
   dispersal altered by physical and biological pressures.}},

Abstract = {{The possible causes for the lack of vegetation in five badland sites
   from southeast Spain were experimentally tested. The main factors
   affecting seed germination and seedling survival considered were seed
   availability, regolith water dynamics in relation to rain events,
   regolith salinity, seedling predation by herbivores and seedling removal
   by erosion.
   Four issues are addressed: 1. Both rainfall and the temporal and spatial
   dynamics of regolith water during the seedling emergence period were
   monitored in five different zones at one site (Petrer, Alicante). 2.
   Effects of salinity and water potential on the rate and speed of
   germination of local seeds were determined. 3. Seed reserve and seedling
   emergence and mortality were followed throughout one season. 4. Regolith
   characteristics of all five sites were compared and the consequences for
   plant colonization discussed.
   The main factor limiting plant colonization in these sites was the very
   short duration of available water in the soil, due to the physical and
   chemical characteristics of the regolith. In addition, high regolith
   salinity and its effects on seed germination, the aspect of the site and
   the pattern of rain events, played a very important role reducing
   germination and survival. Herbivory and erosion were seldom responsible
   for seedling mortality. However, there were no highly erosive rain
   events during the study period, although several have been measured
   during the past few years.}},

Abstract = {{Benthic invertebrates possess a number of characteristics which makes
   them attractive tools for monitoring pollution. This proposition has
   been expressed by many for a long time. Many indites, coefficients and
   analytic approaches have been used to measure the response of marine
   benthic invertebrates to contaminants, Moreover, benthic invertebrates
   are frequently used as `bioindicators', Accurate taxonomic analysis must
   be available for the use of indicator species to be effective (Grant at
   al,, 1995), The Capitella capitata sibling species complex is an example
   of how new information emerges about different ecophysiological
   responses of `siblings', and the exclusion of rare species has seriously
   violated results from general ecological observations and theory,
   leading to unacceptable losses of ecological information; the emerging
   practice of taxononmic sufficiency in monitoring marine benthic
   populations exacerbates such concerns, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Movement is a fundamental feature of vertebrate behavior and can modify
   processes within populations and communities. Because tropical avian
   frugivores disperse seeds of many plant species, the temporal and
   spatial patterning of their movement will influence seed distribution
   within a habitat. To date, little is known about movement patterns of
   these birds. Here we consider the movement of an understory frugivore,
   Mionectes oleagineus. Movements of 16 non-breeding females were
   monitored using continuous radio-telemetry to provide a general
   description of movement patterns and to examine the fractal geometry of
   the spatial component of movement. Most movements were of short distance
   and duration, with the frequency distributions of both measures strongly
   skewed to the left. Over the range of measurement scales considered, the
   fractal dimension of M. oleagineus's movement increased with increasing
   measurement scale up to ca. 100 m, whereafter it appeared to flatten
   out. We combined movement data with M, oleagineus gut-passage rates for
   seeds of six plant species to predict seed shadows. Estimated seed
   shadows were leptokurtic for four of the six plant species, with median
   dispersal distances for all species from 42 to 56 m. Dispersal distances
   were of the order of reported pollen dispersal distances, suggesting
   that even small seed dispersers Like M. oleagineus can provide
   significant dispersal for plant genotypes. Gut-passage rate appears to
   determine the shape of the seed shadow, while movement determines
   dispersal scale.}},

Abstract = {{We define seed limitation to be an increase in population size following
   seed addition. Here, we briefly consider how theoretical models deal
   with seed limitation and how seed sowing experiments can be used to
   unravel the extent of seed limitation in natural systems. We review two
   types of seed addition experiments: seed augmentation studies where
   seeds are added to existing populations: and seed introductions where
   seeds are sown in unoccupied sites. Overall, approximately 50\% of seed
   augmentation experiments show evidence of seed limitation. These studies
   show that seed limitation tends to occur more commonly in early
   successional habitats and in early successional species. Most of the
   studies have concentrated on simply categorising populations as seed- or
   microsite-limited, but we believe that seed sowing experiments could be
   used to reveal much more about community structure, and we discuss
   possible future directions.
   In 53\% of introduction studies (where seeds were sown at sites from
   which the species was known to be absent) the introduced species was
   recorded in at least one of the experimental sites following sowing.
   However, of the subset of studies where both seedlings and adult plants
   were recorded, 64\% of sites contained seedlings while only 23\%
   contained adults. This implies that. for many species, conditions for
   establishment are more stringent than conditions for germination. The
   successful establishment of plants in unoccupied parches indicates the
   potential for immigration to enhance local diversity (the spatial mass
   effect). Few studies continued monitoring for long enough to determine
   whether or not self-sustaining populations were successfully
   established, and no study attempted to link introduction sites to a
   putative natural sourer of propagules, or considered the dynamics of the
   metapopulation as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examines the level of permethrin and malathion
   resistance in human head (Pediculosis capitis) and body (Pediculosis
   humanus L.) louse populations. Putatively insecticide-susceptible body
   and head louse populations were obtained from Israel (IS-BL) and Panama
   (PA-HL), respectively. Putatively insecticide-resistant populations of
   head lice were obtained from Florida (FL-HL) and Massachusetts (MA- HL),
   in the United States, and from Bristul (BR-HL), in the United Kingdom.
   Using knockdown and mortality bioassays, we confirmed permethrin
   resistance in the FL-HL and MA-I-IL populations. Resistance levels of
   the FL-HL and MA-HL populations were 132 and 223 times higher than that
   of the IS-BL population and 41 and 68 times higher than that, of the
   PA-HL population when determined by knockdown resistance ratios.
   Resistance levels of the FL-HL and MA-HL populations were 4.3 and 4.9
   times that of the IS-BL population and 3.8 and 4.3 times that of the
   PA-HL population when determined by mortality resistance ratios. The
   significantly higher levels of resistance determined using the knockdown
   ratios compared to the mortality ratios suggest that nerve
   insensitivity, most likely mediated by mutations within sodium channel
   genes, ia a principal mechanism associated with resistance. None of
   these populations were resistant to malathion. The mortality response
   was significantly synergized by piperonyl butoxide in the PA-I-IL and
   MA-I-IL populations, indicating a possible role of oxidative metabolism
   in these strains. This apparent increase in oxidative metabolism is
   likely responsible for the lower permethrin sensitivity of the PA-HL
   versus the IS-BL and the MA-HL versus the FL-HL populations,
   respectively. Using a homology probing strategy, we have amplified
   para-orthologous louse sodium channel alpha-subunit cDNA fragments that
   span the similar to IIS4-IIS6 region, where most of the sodium channel
   gene mutations that are known to be associated with knockdown resistance
   are located. Through molecular cloning and sequencing, we have
   identified two pi,int mutations, T929I and L932F, located in the IISS
   transmembrane segment of cDNAs from only the permethrin-resistant FL-HL
   and BR-HL populations. Using homologous primers from our initial
   sequencing analysis of the cDNA fragments, we obtained a 568-bp genomic
   DNA fragment and confirmed the presence of the two mutations associated
   with permethrin resistance. The availability of PCR primers that
   directly amplify the genomic DNA fragment containing the mutation sites
   that are widely found associated with knockdown resistance will greatly
   facilitate the development of DNA-based diagnostic protocols For use in
   monitoring programs. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Three field experiments were conducted in southwest and west-central
   Florida in 1993 through 1995 to evaluate the effectiveness of soil
   solarization during autumn in reducing Phytophthora blight of Madagascar
   periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) caused by Phytophthora nicotianae.
   Plots (3.6 by 3.6 m) were infested by incorporating winter wheat seed
   containing P. nicotianae in the upper 15 cm of soil. Solarization was
   then conducted for 21 to 41 days, primarily during October, using clear,
   25- or 50-mu m low-density polyethylene mulch. The progress of
   Phytophthora blight, monitored for 31 to 42 days following planting, was
   significantly reduced by solarization in all experiments, and final
   blight incidence was reduced in two of three experiments. Solarization
   also reduced population densities of P. nicotianae.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal levels were determined in marine mussels Perna perna
   collected from Ubatuba Bay, northern coast of the State of Sao Paulo,
   Brazil, during the period from January to October 1995. The objective of
   the present study was to analyze the seasonal concentrations of some
   metals of toxicological interest (Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn) in Ubatuba Bay
   using the bivalve Perna perna (Linnaeus, 1758) as a biological monitor.
   Collections were performed at three month intervals at Itagua beach. In
   the laboratory, the frozen specimens were thawed at room temperature,
   removed from their shells, partially dried on filter paper, weighed and
   individually submitted to acid digestion with sulfuric acid and hidrogen
   peroxide. The analyses for the detection of Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn were
   carried out by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results
   showed higher metal accumulation during July. The values detected for Pb
   and Cr were relatively high in all seasons, especially in January and
   July (vacation periods) in Ubatuba Bay, with the consequent risk of
   contamination by mussel ingestion for the local population and for
   tourists from other regions.}},

Title = {{Egression of flies from sewage filter-beds}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fly species that inhabit sewage filter-beds can be a public nuisance and
   have to be controlled. Chemical and bacteriological agents used
   currently for such control are washed rapidly from the beds, so, if
   these agents are to be used efficiency, they should be applied only when
   an emergence of adults abundant enough to cause a nuisance is expected.
   The present study examined the phenology of some fly species emanating
   from filter-beds in ten sewage works across a broad latitudinal range
   (51.13 degrees N-57.17 degrees N) in Britain, to establish whether
   environmental temperature alone could be used to predict fly egression
   patterns. Four species were widespread and abundant: the psychodids
   Psychoda albipennis (=P.severini ) and P. alternata, and the chironomids
   Limnophyes minimus and Metriocnemus eurynotus (=M.hygropetricus).
   Average air temperature was a major environmental variable determining
   the phenology of these four species. When the observed polyvoltine
   patterns of egression were compared with predicted patterns based on
   generation time/temperature relationships, they were similar. A poorer
   match was obtained when the temperature of the settled sewage was used.
   Although the air temperature regime could be used to predict when the
   adults of a generation were likely to emerge from the beds, its
   relationship with the relative abundance of the various generations was
   less precise; other environmental variables were clearly also
   significant. It is concluded that larval populations have to be
   monitored if egression abundance is to be forecast accurately. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{In monitoring the circulation of Borrelia burgdorferi in animal
   populations, 207 sera from clinically healthy horses from 11 districts
   of East Slovakia were examined by ELISA. Anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies
   were detected in 99 horses (47.8\%). The highest seroprevalence was
   observed in the districts of Presov (59.1\%) and Kosice (55.2\%). A
   slightly lower seroprevalence was recorded in the districts of Stropkov
   (43.7\%) and Poprad (33.3\%). A significantly lower seroprevalence was
   recorded from Michalovce district (23.8\%) (P < 0.05). The high
   prevalence (25-100\%) found in the rest of the districts is influenced
   to a certain degree by the small number of horses examined. An analysis
   of seroprevalence with respect to the age showed that there was no
   significant differences between 1-3-year-old horses and older horses.
   Seroprevalence showed the same tendency of its occurrence as regards the
   exploitation of horses. A significantly lower seroprevalence was
   recorded in spring compared with summer (P < 0.05).}},

Abstract = {{The natural, postfire regeneration of Pinus brutia forests has been
   studied in two 40-60-year-old forests of Thasos island, North Aegean
   sea, Greece, burned in the summers of 1985 and 1989. Within the latter
   burned area (5 700 ha), forty experimental sites of various aspects and
   site index values were established and successively monitored for 5
   years, at 6-month intervals. Pine seedling emergence took place late in
   spring (due to a long drought in that particular year) but exclusively
   during the first postfire year. By the end of the recruitment period
   (May 1990), mean pine seedling density was considerably high (2-6
   seedlings m(-2)) while a significant drop in the first summer was
   observed. Thereafter, a relatively smooth decline was obtained and the
   density was almost stabilized to about 0.6-2 seedlings m(-2) after 5
   years: the kinetics of survival was found to follow a rectangular
   hyperbola. Significant differences in seedling density values were
   detected among site groups of varying aspect or site index: north-facing
   and index I sites showed the highest density values while south-facing
   and index V ones the lowest. Similarly, height kinetics showed a
   significant divergence among site groups; again, the north-facing and
   the index I sites were the fastest growing. Annual height growth showed
   a linear regression kinetics throughout the 5- (and conceivably 9-)
   year-long postfire period of study, with a yearly increment of 17 cm.
   Starting at an age of 4-6 years, an increasing fraction of the sapling
   population became reproductive so that after 9 years a considerable
   portion (5-15 \%) had already produced cones with fully germinable
   seeds. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.}},

   monitoring of its fragmented and isolated populations is necessary for
   an effective nature conservation manage ment. Analysing of
   microsatellite DNA has been shown to be an efficient method to assess
   genetic variability among a wide variety of organisms. The present paper
   describes how this technique can be used to study populations of root
   voles. Two different DNA sampling and extraction methods and 10
   heterologous primer pails were tested. From these 10 primer pails, 6
   were round appropriate for microsatellite analysis of this species.
   Sequence analysis of the amplified PCR products raised the problem that
   length polymorphism may be the result of variation of a compound

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies have found a correlation between daily mortality
   and particle concentrations in outdoor air as measured at a central
   monitoring station. These studies have been the central reason for the
   U.S. EPA to propose new tighter particle standards. However, personal
   monitoring studies have generally found very poor correlations (often
   approaching 0) between personal exposures and outdoor air
   concentrations. This has led to questions regarding the scientific basis
   of the new EPA standard. One reason for the poor correlations noted in
   the personal monitoring studies is that the correlations were
   cross-sectional: that is, they included many persons (generally
   monitored for only 1 or a few days) with no differentiation between
   persons exposed to high indoor sources (such as smokers) and those with
   much smaller exposures. Some recent studies have improved on this
   situation by following persons for a number of days and performing
   longitudinal correlations on individuals over time. These longitudinal
   correlations are almost invariably much higher than cross-sectional
   correlations. A second possible reason for the low correlations of
   personal exposure with outdoor concentrations is that most studies have
   been done on healthy persons who may be much more active and therefore
   generate more particles than sick persons. Therefore a second set of
   studies has begun to be carried out looking at high-risk subpopulations,
   such as those with existing respiratory or cardiovascular disease.
   A common element in these studies is the existence of a ``personal
   cloud,{''} an increased personal exposure beyond what is calculated from
   a time-weighted average of indoor and outdoor concentrations. The
   personal cloud for healthy persons can be quite sizable, on the order of
   50 mu g/m(3) during the day when people are active and may be a major
   reason for the poor correlations of personal exposure with outdoor air
   concentrations. If the personal cloud of high-risk subpopulations is
   considerably smaller than that of healthy populations and if indoor
   sources are reduced in the impaired populations, then better
   correlations of personal exposure with outdoor air could be expected.
   Recent studies that have quantitated the personal cloud for both healthy
   and sick populations are reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{The interpretation of epidemiological results relating PM,, and personal
   exposure depends an linking exposure to mass concentration in ambient
   outdoor air. To obtain exploratory information on this relationship,
   outdoor, indoor, and personal exposure measurements have been made for a
   small sample population in Birmingham, AL. The observations covered 2
   seasons, summer and winter, for a sample of 10 healthy, nonsmoking
   working class people of ages from 25 to 63 years. The participants
   experienced activity patterns that were similar and were believed to be
   typical of the climate, building conditions, and transportation habits
   in the Deep South. On average, these involved indoor activities more
   than 96-95\% of the time, with occupancy in their residences 56-59\% of
   the time. The methods adapted For the study included the use of
   individual activity diaries and involved sampling for 48 h average mass
   concentrations using conventional filtration and gravimetric mass
   determination. The homes of the participants were used to represent
   indoor conditions. These residences were characterized by a visual
   description and estimation of the air exchange rate and infiltration
   coefficient using a pressurized blower method. The results showed a
   weakly correlated but consistent linear relationship between personal
   exposure and indoor or outdoor ambient air PM2.5 mass concentration. The
   mean personal exposure in mu g/m(3) in 48 h was;found to be 18.6 +/- 6.4
   mu g/m(3) and 10.0 +/- 3.3 mu g/m(3) in summer and winter, respectively.
   These values lie between the outdoor and indoor concentrations in
   summer, hut were slightly less than the other two in winter, The
   measurements of outdoor concentrations taken at each residence
   correlated. with a spatial average of community monitoring stations
   within the city, but differed locally in magnitude. A weak, linearly
   proportional relationship was found between indoor PM,, concentrations
   and the product of the outdoor concentration and the residential
   infiltration factor. Application of a simple mass balance model yielded
   results similar to a much larger study in California. There was some
   evidence of a ``personal cloud{''} present in 9 of 30 observations in
   summer, but only 4 of 30 observations in winter.}},

Abstract = {{Today there is broad agreement that population's health is significantly
   affected by influences from the polluted environment. Among the most
   tremendous consequences are allergies, skin cancer, and deseases of the
   respiratory tract. As a result of increasing frequence of such health
   problems health services started to initiate so-called environmental
   ambulances where patients get proper advice and treatment, especially in
   densely populated areas with severe air pollution problems. It turned
   out that the work of such ambulances can be strongly supported by
   delivering information on environmental conditions such as tropospheric
   ozone smog, aerosol particles and UV irradiance in near-real time. In
   such a way the medical staff is supplied with proper knowledge on the
   occurence of pollution events and their spatial distribution and
   detailed nature.
   The German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) receives data of different
   sensors on various satellite platforms and processes them into products
   of tropospheric ozone, the optical thickness and type of aerosol
   particles and UV intensity on 1-40 km grids. Satellite retrieved
   information itself can thus be a tool to monitor air quality and will
   directly be used by the environmental ambulance and other public health
   services. Furthermore, DFD extracts information about land use/land
   cover from its operational processing chains allowing the
   characterisation of ground pixels in terms of emissions of biogenic
   volatile organic compounds (BVOC) into the air.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that indoor air pollution plays an important part
   in the development of sensitisation and triggering of symptoms of
   respiratory diseases but to date its causal effect has not been
   established. With this in mind a study was designed to examine the
   effect of exposure of children between the ages of 4 and 15 years to a
   number of indoor chemical pollutants, endotoxins, allergens and damp.
   The sample population has been selected from the database of the
   Wythenshawe Community Asthma Project (WyCAP) in Manchester UK.
   Trials were conducted before the onset of the sampling programme in
   order to validate the methodology. The sampling programme is now in
   progress and it is anticipated that overall the programme will span two
   years with data analysis taking place throughout the study. The indoor
   air pollutants and contaminants whose concentrations are measured and
   monitored include: High Risk RSP (respirable suspended particulate
   (PM-2.5)), ETS (environmental tobacco smoke), VOCs (volatile organic
   compounds), NOx (oxides of nitrogen), formaldehyde, endotoxin, house
   dust mite allergen, the presence of visible or measurable damp, and
   mould and fungal allergen levels. In addition, temperature and humidity
   are monitored to assess their role in the expression of asthma in young
   children.}},

Abstract = {{The movements of 19 natterjack toads (Bufo calamita) were monitored by
   telemetry in a semi-arid agricultural landscape in NE Spain. Toads
   reproduced in two water pools in fields of barley and an ancient
   clay-quarrying zone filled by rainfall. Thirteen toads were followed
   during the breeding season (weeks 5-17 of 1997) and 11 toads were
   followed after reproduction (weeks 18 to 46). During the breeding season
   four toads moved distances of up to 500 m between breeding sites. No
   significant differences in movement patterns were found between the
   sexes, but a tendency was observed for males to show higher terrestrial
   site fidelity than females. Distances moved after the breeding season
   were substantial. The distance between the furthest positions recorded
   was from 164 to 1201 m, the maximum distance observed between dairy
   recordings ranged from 125 to 353 m and the maximum overall distances
   ranged from 567 to 4411 m. No significant differences were observed
   between males and females or between small and large toads. The
   movements of these toads in a semi-arid agricultural Landscape in Spain
   are compared with those observed in England and Germany.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical relationships between predators (red fox Vulpes vulpes, pine

   were studied using the data from the Finnish wildlife monitoring scheme
   in 1989-2000. Line transect (wildlife triangle) data were used to obtain
   snow track indices of relative predator abundance. Finland was divided
   into 29 100 x 100 km squares, each including the mean of 348 km of
   transect line (total length > 10 000 km annually). The abundance of fox
   was related to the yearly growth rate of hare populations in 48\% of the
   squares. The growth rates of fox and hare populations also correlated in
   45\% of the squares, indicating that there was a mutual relationship
   between hare and fox populations in about half of the squares. This
   relationship existed in areas with low/moderate hare and high fox
   numbers (a low hare/fox index) but was lacking in areas with a high
   hare/fox index, pointing to both functional and numerical response for
   foxes preying on hares. Then was also a positive spatial correlation
   between hare and lynx numbers, but the correlation between hare and
   marten numbers was weak.}},

Abstract = {{Defoliations of Prunus padus by Yponomeuta evonymellus were monitored in
   two areas in southern Finland. During a long-term study (1980-1995) in
   the area with high peak defoliations, P. padus trees recorded two
   defoliation peaks, leading to complete defoliation of many trees. The
   negative relationship between pupal mass and current year tree
   defoliation during the peak years suggested shortage of food affected
   reproductive potential of Y. evonymellus, Furthermore, no delayed
   induced resistance was observed in these populations. Interannual
   correlations ill degrees of defoliation experienced by individual trees
   were low, i.e. high defoliation in one year did not predict the degree
   of defoliation the following year. We also detected a sharp increase in
   parasitism rates with defoliation between years. In the other study area
   located about 150 km NW, only 4\% of more than 200 study trees
   experienced defoliations higher than 50\%. In this population, high
   defoliation of tree individuals in one year predicted low defoliation in
   the following year. In addition, rates of parasitism were less variable
   and intermediate compared to those in the high peak area. Altogether,
   the relatively rapidly operating negative feedback in the low peak -
   compared with the high peak area - was consistent with the difference
   between both areas in the levels of peak densities.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{543-549}},
Abstract = {{Aggression in groups of 0+ Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was monitored
   at weekly intervals in two tanks containing 100 fish each. Three 1 +
   salmon parr were added to one of these. After 5 weeks, fish weights were
   measured in both tanks and the conditions reversed. At ten weeks,
   weights of fish in both tanks were measured again. In both populations,
   levels of aggression among the smaller fish were significantly lower and
   growth rates significantly higher when the large fish were present.
   Although the large fish attacked the small ones, the rate at which they
   did so was an order of magnitude lower that the rate at which small fish
   attacked each other in the absence of larger conspecifics. This raises
   the possibility that levels of aggression among farmed salmon might be
   reduced by the addition of a few large conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic improvement of aquaculture species offers a substantial
   opportunity for increased production efficiency, health, product quality
   and, ultimately, profitability in aquacultural enterprises.
   Technolo-gies exist that can be implemented immediately to improve
   multiple traits that have economic value, while simultaneously
   accounting for inbreeding effects. Genetic improvement techniques for
   delivering genetic gain include formal definition of the breeding
   objective, estimation of genetic parameters that describe populations
   and their differences, evaluation of additive and non-additive genetic
   merit of individuals or families and defining the structure of a
   breeding programme in terms of mating plans. Novel genetic technologies
   involving the use of DNA-based tools are also under development for a
   range of aquaculture species. These gene marker technologies can be used
   for identification and monitoring of lines, families and individuals,
   monitoring and control of inbreeding, diagnosis of simply inherited
   traits and genetic improvement through selection for favourable genes
   and gene combinations. The identification of quantitative trait loci
   (QTL), and direct or linked markers for them, will facilitate
   marker-assisted selection in aquaculture species, enabling improvement
   in economically important traits, particularly those that are difficult
   to breed for, such as food conversion efficiency and disease resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Species or strains of fish may be translocated for farming, where the
   only access to the wild is via inadvertent escapes, or for stocking,
   where deliberate releases are undertaken. In either case, it is
   important that the translocated animals are representative of the donor
   population(s) in terms of genetic composition and level of variability.
   Many studies have shown that this ideal is difficult to achieve, the
   major reason being the use of inadequate numbers or composition of
   broodstock as founders of a strain. Also, where more than one
   conspecific population is involved, there may be outbreeding depression
   problems. In the case of farming, measures to improve the introduced
   strain genetically are likely to be undertaken, e.g. breeding
   programmes, manipulation of sex and ploidy, transgenic techniques. Such
   approaches are necessary economically, but can alter genetic make-up.
   Thus, stringent attempts must be made to minimize escapes or reduce
   their impact should they occur. With stocking, genetic change during
   captive rearing should be avoided. No strain manipulation should be
   undertaken, and other agents of change should be minimized. Stocking may
   result in hybridization with related species or with endemic populations
   of the same species. In either case, there can be detrimental genetic
   effects on the native forms. To be able to identify subsequently any
   genetic changes in reared strains, whether intended for farming or
   stocking, wild population composition should be determined, using
   appropriate molecular techniques. Such molecular methods will
   demonstrate the degree of interpopulation differentiation and, thus,
   reproductive isolation. The same markers should then be used in each
   subsequent generation (in the hatchery and after escape or
   reintroduction to the wild) to monitor any changes in genetic
   composition or variability. Markers should include microsatellite DNA
   loci, but the inclusion of more than one type of marker is recommended.
   However, as the aforementioned markers are not considered to be
   influenced by natural selection, they give no information on the
   adaptive nature of such differences. For this reason, it is suggested
   that markers influenced by selection should be investigated. Monitoring
   a strain subsequent to deliberate or inadvertent release can be
   undertaken using genetic markers, either deliberately enhanced by
   breeding or occurring naturally. Highly variable minisatellite DNA loci
   have been used as family markers in farmed escape studies with Atlantic
   salmon. These investigations have demonstrated significantly superior
   survival of native strains compared with farmed salmon in natural stream
   conditions. These latter results, demonstrating fitness differences,
   were strongly indicative of local adaptation. Thus, methods exist to
   monitor the genetic effects of translocation and stocking. However, a
   holistic approach should be taken to such exercises, where genetics
   forms part of a wider suite of considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Bone fluoride concentrations were analyzed in 141 red deer antlers grown
   between the 17th/early 18th century and 1997, that originated from four
   study areas (Arnsberg, Bad Berleburg, Dammerwald, Schmidtheim) in the
   federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Fluoride
   concentrations in the specimens ranged between 27.7 and 1,392.1 mg F-/kg
   ash and varied significantly both between samples collected during
   different time-spans in the same area and between samples taken from
   different study areas over the same period. For antlers (n = 8)
   collected prior to 1860 in the study areas Arnsberg and Schmidtheim,
   values between 27.7 and 78.7 mg F-/kg ash were recorded. It is assumed
   that antler fluoride contents in this range are quite close to baseline
   levels for these regions, i.e., represent concentrations largely
   unaffected or only slightly influenced by fluoride from anthropogenic
   sources. With the onset and expansion of large-scale industrial
   activities, bone fluoride concentrations in the antler samples markedly
   increased over these baseline values, indicating fluoride deposition
   from industrial emissions into the red deer habitats. In the later 1980s
   and the 1990s, a pronounced decline in antler fluoride content was
   observed, which is attributed to the reduction of industrial fluoride
   discharges due to effective emission control programs. However, even the
   lowest fluoride values recorded for antlers grown in the 1990s (study
   area Schmidtheim, n = 10, range 158.5-367.3 mg F-/kg ash) clearly
   exceeded the concentrations found in the antlers collected prior to
   1860, thereby indicating an additional fluoride burden from
   anthropogenic sources on the recent populations. The present study has
   corroborated the view that antlers are good indicators of fluoride
   exposure in deer. The facts that they grow during a seasonally fixed
   time-span and thus constitute relatively well ``naturally
   standardized{''} samples and are often kept over long periods of time
   make antlers suitable monitoring units for historical biomonitoring
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Wintering waterfowl gathering in large flocks during the day may be
   attractive to avian predators in a way similar to that of bird colonies.
   The response of Marsh Harriers to changes in dabbling duck abundance was
   monitored on four freshwater sites in the marshes of western France, a
   major wintering region for wildfowl in the country. The number of
   harriers present at each site remained stable throughout the winter.
   However, the frequency of prospecting fly-overs by harriers, i.e. search
   effort, increased with duck abundance. Frequency of fly-overs was also
   affected by the number of conspecifics present on the site, wind
   velocity and time of the day, and varied between months. All these
   factors are discussed in relation to prey availability, competition, and
   minimization of energy expenses while searching. `Female morph' harriers
   appeared to scout more over duck flocks than `male morph' harriers,
   which is consistent with the fact that sexual segregation in feeding
   habits is often recorded in dimorphic raptors. Direct predation was
   rarely seen but ducks always reacted to the fly-overs of harriers. The
   raptors were responsible for up to 130 disturbances per day and the
   number of disturbances was correlated to the number of ducks present.
   The activity of harriers may therefore affect the behaviour of dabbling
   ducks, hence the quality of their wintering quarters.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater turtles, tortoises, and softshell turtles are exported from a
   few locations in Sumatra in Large quantities. The trade involves all
   species native to Sumatra and two exotic species. This study found that
   more than 25 tons of live turtles are exported each week to China, Hong
   Kong, and Singapore from two exporting companies surveyed in the
   provinces of North Sumatra and Riau, Actual figures would be higher but
   no records were available of export by sea from Medan, Two additional
   exporting companies were not surveyed. According to government
   statistics, these two provinces exported approximately half of the
   softshell turtles exported from the entire country in 1998, While laws
   are in place to protect some of the species, monitoring and enforcement
   is inadequate and ineffective. According to all dealers interviewed
   during this study, wild populations of all species are declining.
   Trappers bring in fewer turtles, resulting in export volumes that have
   dropped to about half of what they were two or three years ago.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variations in urban air pollution are of considerable
   significance both because of the growing evidence for associations
   between exposure and human health and because of the increasing
   requirement for action to control and reduce levels of air pollution.
   This study examines sources and patterns of variation in NO2, as a
   marker for traffic-related pollution, in four predominantly urban study
   areas: Amsterdam (Netherlands), Huddersfield (UK), Poznan (Poland) and
   Prague (Czech Republic). Data on pollution levels were collected using
   passive samplers, deployed in duplicate for 2 week periods on four
   occasions over one year. Mixed-effect modelling was used to explore the
   magnitude of between-survey, between-site and between-sampler and
   interaction :effects, and to provide a measure of mean annual
   concentration at each sample site. Measured concentrations varied
   significantly between different surveys, with a tendency to be higher in
   winter months. Strong correlations were seen, however, between monitored
   concentrations in successive surveys, suggesting that the geographic
   pattern of variation: in:all areas was essentially stable over time.
   Between-sampler variation was seen to be small (CV generally 5-8\%),
   indicating that the samplers provided consistent measures of NO2
   concentrations. There were also strongly significant between-site and
   site-survey interaction effects. Between-site variation accounted for
   between 61\% (Poznan) and 84\% (Prague) of total observed variation;
   expressed as a coefficient of variation, between-site variation was
   least in Amsterdam, the smallest and most uniform study area (22\%), and
   greatest in Prague (42\%), The modelled mean annual NO2 concentration,
   derived from the mixed-effect model, gave a good prediction of mean
   annual concentration measured using passive;samplers on a continuous
   basis, at 8-10 reference sites in each study area (r(2) > 0.85). Based
   on the modelled:results, it appears that WHO and national air quality
   standards for NO2 will be routinely exceeded at a number of sites in
   each study area. Given the apparent stability of the pollution surface
   in each area, these `hotspots' are also likely to: be persistent over
   time, implying the potential for relatively high risks of chronic
   exposure in local populations. Overall the results indicate the
   capability to characterise spatial variation in traffic-related
   pollution in urban areas using a-small number of intensive surveys, with
   low-cost sampling devices. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Personal CO exposures of 194 preschool children were measured with
   personal exposure monitors during a 24 week sampling period from fall
   1990 to spring 1991 in Helsinki, Finland. Arithmetic mean of the maximum
   1 and 8 h exposure levels were 6.0 and 3.3 mg m(-3). The then Finnish
   ambient air quality guideline values for 1/8 h maximum CO level (30/10
   mg m(-3)) were exceeded in 2/4\% of the children's daily maximum 1/8 h
   exposure levels. Gas stove at home, parents, especially mother, smoking
   in the home, and living in high rise buildings - reflecting higher local
   population and traffic density - increased the children's CO exposures.
   The presence of a fireplace in the home was associated with decreased CO
   exposures. Father's high education reduced the children's CO exposure
   while mother's education level had no significant effect. The peak (15
   min) exposure levels of the children commuting to day care center by car
   or bus were higher than those of the children who walked or came by
   bike. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Urban air pollution is a major environmental problem in several
   developing countries in the world. This phenomenon seems to be related
   to the growth of both the urban population in large cities and the
   number of old and poorly maintained car fleets. The expected rise of
   population in the next century in countries which suffer from lack of
   capital for air pollution control, means that there is a great potential
   for the worsening of the air quality. The worldwide promoted policy to
   phase out lead in gasolines has not proved to be an adequate option in
   improving the environmental quality. Mexico City Metropolitan Area
   (MCMA) represents a case in which the introduction of reformulated
   gasolines in an old car fleet has given as a result the reduction of the
   airborne lead levels but has worsened the ozone concentration of its
   urban atmosphere. This paper critically analyzes the chronological
   evolution of the ozone air pollution problem in MCMA after the
   successive occurrence of several changes in the formulation of low
   leaded and unleaded gasolines. It also presents evidences of the
   usefulness potential of air quality monitoring activities and air
   quality impact studies on the definition of realistic fuel reformulation
   policies of developing countries. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {{Emissions from in-use lawn-mowers in Australia}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{657-664}},
Abstract = {{Concern over the levels of pollutants emitted from small engines has led
   to recent legislation in the United States that regulates exhaust
   emissions from lawn and garden equipment. Particular attention has
   focused on the high levels of hydrocarbons emitted by these engines. The
   present study establishes emission factors for lawn-mowers in use in
   Australia. The estimates were calculated on the basis of a series of
   controlled emission tests conducted on commonly used lawn-mowers. Ten
   two-stroke and six four-stroke lawn-mower engines were operated under
   simulated power requirements while fuel usage and gas emissions were
   monitored. Fuel consumption rates from the tests were compared to those
   ascertained under actual mowing conditions in field tests conducted on
   19 two-stroke and ten four-stroke lawn-mowers. Basic emission factors
   were established for CO, CO2, CH2, NMHC and NOx, and combined with data
   on machine population and annual usage collected in a survey of lawn
   care practices and lawn-mower usage conducted in the Newcastle area.
   When compared to transport sources in the Newcastle study region,
   lawn-mowers contribute 5.2 and 11.6\% of CO and NMHC emissions,
   respectively. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Occurrence of C-10-C-13 polychlorinated n-alkanes in the atmosphere of
   the United Kingdom}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{3085-3090}},
Abstract = {{Short-chain (C-10-C-13) polychlorinated n-alkanes (PCAs) have been
   measured in the air in the United Kingdom at 2 week intervals over a
   period of 12 months. The mean concentration of PCAs over the sampling
   period was 320 +/- 320 pg m(-3) (arithmetic mean +/- 1 S.D.) with a
   geometric mean of 160 pg m(-3). Hexa- and hepta-chlorinated dodecane
   congeners are the predominant PCA components in the UK atmosphere.
   Analyses of gas phase and particulate phase PCAs indicate that 95\% of
   the PCA content of the atmosphere is in the gas phase. No seasonal trend
   or dependence on temperature was observed. The data can be divided into
   2 significantly different (P < 0.01) populations: one group of
   incidences of lower concentrations of 150 +/- 110 pg m(-3) and one of
   higher concentrations of 800 +/- 170 pg m(-3). The incidences of
   elevated concentrations could not be related to increased air
   temperature or other meteorological factors on the time-scale employed
   and suggest that atmospheric PCA concentrations in the UK may be
   dominated by episodic incidences of advective transport of contaminated
   air masses and/or releases to the environment from regional primary
   point sources rather than by temperature-dependent transport processes.
   Levels of PCAs in the UK atmosphere are similar to values obtained at a
   semi-rural location in Canada and at least an order of magnitude higher
   than in the Canadian Arctic atmosphere. These data represent the first
   detailed study on the occurrence of PCAs in the atmosphere and show that
   PCAs can be a major component of the persistent organic pollutant burden
   of the atmosphere which has the potential of undergoing long-range
   atmospheric transport processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A 17-day pilot study investigating potential PM exposures of an elderly
   population was conducted near Baltimore, Maryland. Collection of
   residential indoor, residential outdoor, and ambient monitoring data
   associated with the subjects living at a common retirement facility was
   integrated with results from a paired epidemiological pilot study. This
   integration was used to investigate the potential pathophysiological
   health effects resulting from daily changes in estimated PM exposures
   with results reported elsewhere. Objectives of the exposure study were
   to determine the feasibility of performing PM exposure assessment upon
   an elderly population and establishing relationships between the various
   exposure measures including personal monitoring. PM2.5, was determined
   to be the dominant outdoor size fraction (0.83 PM2.5/PM10 mass ratio by
   dichot monitoring). Individual 24-h PM1.5 personal exposures ranged from
   12 to 58 mu g m(-3). Comparison of data from matched sampling dates
   resulted in mean daily PM1.5 personal, PM2.5 outdoor, and PM1.5 indoor
   concentrations of 34, 17, and 17 mu g m(-3), respectively. Activity
   patterns of the study population indicated a generally sedentary
   population spending a mean of 96\% of each day indoors. Future studies
   would benefit from the use of a consistent sampling methodology across a
   larger number of PM measurement sites relevant to the elderly subjects,
   as well as a larger personal PM exposure study population to more
   successfully collect data needed in matched epidemiological-exposure
   studies. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{I monitored 278 Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nests in 14 forest
   fragments (range 7 to 500 ha) in northern Indiana to explore patterns of
   brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), nest
   predation, and reproductive success. Density of thrushes was negatively
   related to area of forest fragments. Cowbirds were common throughout the
   landscape, but I found no relationship between their abundance and
   forest area. Overall, 90\% of the thrush nests were parasitized by
   cowbirds ((x) over bar = 2.4 cowbird eggs per nest). The number of
   cowbird eggs per thrush nest was not related to forest area, abundance
   of host species, or distance to a forest edge but was positively related
   to thrush abundance. Nest predation rates averaged 58\% and were lower
   than those reported in much of neighboring Illinois but also were
   unrelated to forest area and distance to a forest edge. The combination
   of cowbird parasitism and nest predation resulted in relatively low
   reproductive success ((x) over bar = 0.6 thrush fledglings per nesting
   attempt). I estimated that Wood Thrushes in northern Indiana made an
   average of three nesting attempts per breeding season (based on 17
   color-marked females) and had relatively low seasonal fecundity ((x)
   over bar = 0.9 female fledglings per adult female per season).
   Nonetheless, considerable annual variation in seasonal fecundity
   suggested that some sites exceeded the source-sink threshold in some
   years. Regardless, the overall landscape appeared to be part of a
   regional sink for Wood Thrushes, although its negative influence on
   regional demography was not as severe as elsewhere in the midwestern
   United States. The poor demographic balance in much of the
   agriculturally dominated Midwest suggests that conservation efforts for
   Wood Thrushes and other Nearctic-Neotropical migrants should be directed
   at preserving and enhancing possible source habitats in regions where
   parasitism by cowbirds and nest Predation are reduced.}},

   High Gold, Sunrise and Spider was compared. The Leucospermum plants were
   potted, placed in a fibreglass tunnel and inoculated. Fungicide
   treatments began 4 weeks after inoculation. Stem lesion length was
   measured and the degree of leaf chlorosis as well as root rot were rated
   at the conclusion of the experiment. The pathogen was re-isolated from
   the root and crown of each plant, and soil baiting and dilutions were
   done to monitor soil populations of P. cinnamomi. During the 1997
   season, metalaxyl-M gave the best control compared with the other
   treatments. The combination of metalaxyl-M with cv. Spider completely
   suppressed symptom development. However, during the 1998 season when
   climatic conditions were favourable for disease development, no
   differences were observed between the treatments and the control. Cv.
   Spider had higher tolerance against the fungus even with the most
   aggressive isolate and during the warmer 1998 season, indicating the
   importance of combining chemical control with plant resistance. None of
   the treatments showed any phytotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The principal host of the mistletoe, Amyema preissii, near Alice Springs
   is the short-lived, fast-growing tree, Acacia victoriae. In order to
   describe the dynamics of their interaction, the fate, size and phenology
   of mistletoes were monitored in natural host stands, infection
   experiments were conducted to determine establishment success and growth
   rates of seedlings, hosts were repeatedly disinfected in a 14.6-ha
   paddock surrounded by infected source trees, and mistletoe reinvasion of
   disinfected trees was monitored. In the unmanipulated population of A.
   victoriae, 46-54\% of trees (> 2 m in height) were infected (5.8-6.7
   mistletoes per infected tree). Establishment percentage of mistletoe
   seeds deployed on host branches varied between 11-24\% after 12-23
   months, and most naturally-dispersed seedlings established on branches
   20 mm in diameter. Estimates of natural mistletoe dispersal to
   uninfected trees varied between 2 and 12 seeds per infected tree over
   periods of 8-23 months. Examination of young mistletoes showed that 24\%
   of 122 clumps consisted of more than one mistletoe, with 27 occurrences
   of double infection and two occurrences of triple infection at the same
   point on the host branch. Mistletoes grew rapidly: in one sown cohort,
   plants achieved canopy diameters of 152-170 cm within 18-23 months, and
   half were flowering 15 months after germination. In unmanipulated
   populations, the largest mistletoes had a maximum canopy diameter of 250
   cm and a maximum host branch diameter proximal to the haustorium of 100
   mm, but modal sizes of these measures were 80-120 cm and < 10 mm,
   respectively.
   Turnover in the host population in the disinfection paddock was rapid:
   60\% of trees died between 1990 and 1995, mortality being balanced by
   recruitment. In unmanipulated stands of host trees, larger trees were
   more likely to be infected and supported larger numbers of mistletoes
   per tree than small trees. Once mistletoes had been removed from trees
   in the disinfection paddock, larger trees were still disproportionately
   infected by reinvading mistletoes and trees that had been infected
   previously were more likely to be reinfected. In order to fully describe
   the spatial and temporal dynamics of this host-mistletoe combination,
   further studies are needed of mistletoe persistence and mortality
   through time and annual seed production as a function of mistletoe size.}},

Abstract = {{The post-mating mortality of males in dasyurid species is thought to be
   a specific life-history strategy, associated with a tightly synchronised
   breeding season, that may enhance survivorship of juveniles.
   Parantechinus apicalis has been reported to exhibit male die-off in
   island populations but not in mainland populations, and males
   originating from both island and mainland populations are known to
   survive post-mating in captivity. However, males in the island
   populations have been reported to sometimes survive to breed in a second
   year. This study monitored captive and island populations over a
   three-year period (April 1997 May 2000) to examine the extent of male
   die-off. In captivity, males showed no evidence of post-mating
   mortality. Males on one island were also found to survive post-mating,
   while another island population appeared to have high mortality of males
   in three years, and a complete male die-off after the 1999 breeding
   season. We conclude that P. apicalis may warrant inclusion in a new
   category of life-history strategy for species exhibiting facultative
   male die-off.}},

Abstract = {{Oil palm is an important cash crop in Papua New Guinea (PNG), with about
   80,000 hectares in cultivation, grown both on large-scale plantations
   and by smallholders. The principal pests of oil palm in PNG are a group
   of insect species from the Tettigoniidae family (Orthoptera), known
   collectively as sexava. Three species of sexava are pests of oil palm in
   PNG, Segestes decoratus, S. defoliaria and S. novaeguineae. These
   insects cause damage by feeding on oil palm fronds and defoliation
   levels call be very severe where high populations occur. Severe
   defoliation causes reductions in photosynthesis resulting in yield loss
   from lower fruit production. During the last five years an integrated
   system has been developed for the management of sexava. The integrated
   pest management (IPM) system described here has the following
   components:- (1) a knowledge of the biology and ecology of the pest, (2)
   economic thresholds, (3) monitoring system for the pest, (4) precise
   targeting of chemical control agents, (5) biological control and (6)
   cultural and physical control. The IPM system is sustainable and
   environmentally acceptable to the industry. Future research involving
   the development of strepsipteran parasites for biological control is
   likely to improve this system still further.}},

Abstract = {{The most important constraint to potato production in the UK is the
   damage caused by the potato cyst nematodes (PCN) Globodera pallida and
   G. rostochiensis. Management systems for PCN depend heavily on the use
   of nematicides which, at c. pound 360 per ha for granular and c. pound
   550 per ha for fumigant nematicides, are costly. Of all the inputs in UK
   agriculture, nematicides offer the largest potential savings if safe and
   reliable spatial application procedures can be developed. These savings
   would be accompanied by the environmental benefits of local reductions
   in the burden of toxic nematicides applied to land. We have mapped the
   PCN infestations in three fields due for ware potato production and have
   monitored the changes in PCN population density and distribution that
   have occurred when a susceptible potato crop is grown. The inverse
   relationship between pre-planting population density and multiplication
   rate of PCN make it difficult to devise safe spatial application
   procedures, especially when the preplanting population density is just
   below the detection threshold. Also, the fine scale of spatial
   dependence found suggests that the coarse sampling grids that are used
   commercially may produce maps showing distribution patterns that are
   misleading.}},

   stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala) in autumn, and pollen beetle
   (Meligethes aeneus), rape stem weevil (Ceutorhynchus napi), cabbage stem
   weevil (Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus), cabbage seed weevil (Ceutorhynchus
   assimilis) and brassica pod midge (Dasineura brassicae) in spring. It is
   based on 8 years of field observations on the influence of the weather
   on the population dynamics of these pests in different regions of
   Germany. The program takes into account not only numbers of adults (e.g.
   monitored by yellow traps) but also weather-based forecasts of flight
   conditions, egg-laying periods and larval development. This
   phenology-based strategy improves the basis for treatment decisions and
   optimises dates for field inspection and insecticide application. Fewer
   treatments are generally needed than with a threshold-based control
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between dry-matter partitioning in field-grown potato
   plants and the abundance of aphid pests was investigated for four years,
   1994-1996 and 1999. The dominant aphid was Macrosiphum euphorbiae and,
   for every year except 1996, the aphid population declined rapidly at the
   time of potato tuber filling. In 1996, the aphid populations at one
   monitored field site peaked three weeks after the onset of tuber
   filling. Detailed studies of the age-structure of the aphid populations
   indicated that young nymphs comprised >80\% of the population at all
   times, but that the abundance of alatiform aphids increased at the time
   of peak aphid populations. These data suggest that the production of
   alate individuals that fly from the crop may contribute to the aphid
   population decline. The role of plant nutritional quality and other
   factors (e.g. natural enemies) in causing the decline of aphid
   populations on potato crop is considered.}},

Abstract = {{The temperate sandstone caves of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa,
   support 85 cavernicolous invertebrate species across six phyla. Six of
   these, including two blind and depigmented species of insects
   (Dermaptera) and spiders (Araneae: Hahniidae) were previously unknown.
   Twenty-one species are endemic to the Peninsula. Thirteen of these are
   presumed troglobitic Gondwanan relicts, including highly specialized,
   phylogenetically unique, rare species with restricted distributions and
   specialized habitat requirements. According to the criteria listed in
   the IUCN Red List Categories (1994), the onychophoran Peripatopsis alba
   and crustacean Spelaeogriphus lepidops should be considered Critically
   Endangered, their extents of occurrence being less than 100 km(2).
   Furthermore, Data Deficient species, such as the freshwater shrimps
   Protojanira leleupi and Paramelita barnardi, the spider Hahnia sp.nov.,
   the earwig Dermaptera sp.nov. and the centipede Cryptops stupendus, are
   likely to be additional Critically Endangered species on account of
   their exceptional rarity or restricted distributions. The remaining
   endemic cavernicoles are considered Endangered on account of their
   limited distributions (extent of occurrence < 5000 km(2)). Therefore,
   conservation considerations are clearly an urgent priority and
   appropriate recommendations are provided. Management-orientated
   research, long-term population monitoring and the conservation of
   pseudokarst areas, are urgent requirements for the conservation of these
   rare and threatened evolutionary relicts in their isolated island-like
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Diel variations in decapod crustaceans catch rate, as well as variations
   in size of sampled individuals, were investigated in a sublittoral
   portion of Ubatuba Bay (23 degrees 20', 23 degrees 35'S and 44 degrees
   50', 45 degrees 14'W) in order to detect differential patterns of
   occurrence. Three replicate trawls, each enclosing a 2,500 m(2) area,
   were performed at a median depth of 3.5 m during the waning moon period,
   in 3 consecutive summer and winter months. Trawls were conducted at
   dawn, noon, dusk and midnight. Hydrological and substratum features were
   monitored. Penaeoideans did not show a significant diel catch rate
   variation during the sampling periods, but the catch rate of brachyurans
   was highest at dusk and midnight during winter (p < 0.01). Fixing diel
   variation, catch rates of both brachyurans and penaeoideans are
   subjected to significant seasonal differences (p < 0.05). The largest
   specimens of Callinectes ornatus, Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, Rimapenaeus
   constrictus and Farfantepenaeus spp were found at twilight during
   summer. Differences on size of captured individuals mainly in samples of
   portunids and penaeids taken during the course of the day evidences that
   significant daily movements take place. This confirms that activity
   alterations depend on characteristics of daily schedules and on
   environmental demands of studied species.}},

Abstract = {{The transplantation of 0.4 ha of montane grassland in the Hart Mountains
   was accompanied by evaluating the achievement of declared objectives for
   5 years. The project is unique in central Europe with respect to the
   transplantation technique employed, size of translocated area and
   intensity of monitoring. The meadow was transplanted to a nearby
   location using a bulldozer with a special excavating shovel. The
   preservation of the flora of the whole transplanted area was successful.
   Disturbance indicator species appeared only to a negligible degree. Of
   18 regionally threatened species present, the majority responded
   indifferently or positively to the transplantation; only two showed a
   distinct decline in population size, which was probably not caused by
   the transplantation alone. The preservation of the species composition
   of the four vegetation types occurring in the study area after a period
   of 4 years was also successful with all types reverting toward their
   pre-transplantation state. In contrast, the maintainance of the spatial
   vegetation mosaic failed completely. Dissection of previously coherent
   vegetation types and levelling of the ground surface resulted in an
   artificial vegetation pattern with predominantly geometric patterns. (C)

Abstract = {{The natural attenuation processes that enhance degradation of organic
   constituents dissolved in groundwater were augmented via a nutrient
   addition field application to reduce the time and associated costs of a
   monitored natural attenuation program. The depletion of essential
   nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, in the site aquifer, was a natural
   degradation rate-limiting factor. Commercially available ammonium
   sulfate and hydrated sodium phosphate were injected into the affected
   groundwater at an empirically derived, desired
   carbon:nitrogen:phosphorous mass ratio of 100:10:1. The concentrations
   of the targeted organic constituents, benzene, chlorobenzene,
   cis-l,2-dichloroethene, ethylbenzene, toluene, naphthalene, vinyl
   chloride, and xylene, were reduced by 25\% to 60\% in the test wells
   over a six-week period, whereas historic site degradation rates were
   less than 4\% annually. Pre-and post-injection microbial plate counts
   and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses were also conducted. After a
   two-week lag period, plate counts increased by one to three orders of
   magnitude, followed by a slight decrease corresponding with the
   consumption/depletion of the injected nutrients. In addition, the
   evaluation of the PLFA analysis results confirmed that the biomass
   associated with the degradation of the organics, which was quantified as
   60\% of the total population, increased without adverse affects to the
   remainder of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Site investigations at a manufacturing facility in Virginia delineated
   soil and groundwater contamination by chlorinated solvents
   (trichloroethylene (TCE); 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA); and associated
   breakdown products) as well as acetone and isopropanol. Chemical and
   microbiological sampling over time showed that natural biodegradation of
   these compounds was occurring at a limited rate. In-situ enhancement of
   cometabolic bioremediation through the injection of air, gaseous-phase
   nutrients, and methane was undertaken to stimulate existing microbial
   populations to promote and accelerate contaminant breakdown.
   A key factor in the selection of this remedy was the need to avoid
   interference with manufacturing operations. Natural subsurface
   challenges included groundwater flow in a clay overburden and underlying
   fractured interbedded shale and limestone. Man-made challenges included
   extensive subsurface utilities and above ground structures essential to
   plant operations.
   Under the facility's RCRA Corrective Action program, an Interim Measure
   (IM) was initiated in one of three contaminant source areas as a
   full-scale enhanced bioremediation field test. The design of the
   injection system was performed in consultation with technology
   developers from the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site. EPA and
   state agency approval was secured in early 1997, and system start-up
   occurred in March 1998. This field test is also being reviewed by the
   EPA Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) program.
   The system features injection of oxygen, gaseous-phase nutrients
   (nitrous oxide and triethyl phosphate), and carbon source (methane).
   Baseline and periodic monitoring has included testing of soil gas for
   contaminant concentrations and indicator gases such as methane, carbon
   dioxide, and oxygen. Groundwater samples have been analyzed for site
   contaminants land associated daughter products), microbial populations,
   and groundwater quality parameters.
   Monitoring of the injection zone of influence has shown that the
   enhanced bioremediation system has been successful in stimulating
   microbial growth based on increases in phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA)
   biomass measurements of several orders of magnitude within four months
   of system start-up. The results from groundwater monitoring indicate
   significant (similar to 60 to 99.96\%) total volatile organic compound
   (VOC) reductions in the pilot test area and down gradient monitoring
   locations since the initiation of the injection campaign. This indicates
   that the bioremediation process is very effective treating dissolved
   phase contaminants. Based on these observations, the system has recently
   been expanded to full scale application to increase the delivery of the
   necessary amendments to complete the site restoration process in the
   source area.}},

Pages = {{934-956}},
Abstract = {{The Atlantic Forest region (wide sense) includes very complex tropical
   environments, increasingly threatened by extensive anthropogenic
   conversion (> 30\%). Ecologically specialized, short-generation insects
   (butterflies) are evaluated here as indicators for monitoring community
   richness, landscape integrity, and sustainable resource use in the
   region. The > 2100 butterfly species in the Atlantic Forest region have
   been censused in many sites over 35 years, giving comparable daily,
   weekly, monthly, and long-term site lists. The 21 most thoroughly
   studied sites include 218-914 species, of which half can be censused in
   a week or less. The butterfly communities are divided into six
   relatively distinct faunal regions, centered in the northeast, the
   central coastal tablelands, the southeast coastal plain, the mountains
   plus interior of the southeastern states, the central plateau, and the
   southern states. Species richness shows the highest values in coastal
   mountains from 15 to 23 degreesS. Local butterfly communities show a
   high turnover, with 20 to 40 percent of the species, especially small
   Lycaenidae and Hesperiidae, recorded only as unstable populations or
   ``tourists.{''} Easily sampled species in the family Nymphalidae, and
   especially its bait-attracted subfamilies, are best correlated with the
   entrire butterfly fauna and can be used as surrogates for species
   diversity In most butterfly groups, species richness is well predicted
   by landscape connectivity alone, or by composite indices of
   environmental heterogeneity, natural disturbance, and (negatively)
   anthropogenic disturbance. Principal components and redundancy analyses
   showed that the richness and proportions of different butterfly groups
   in the local fauna are variably explained by disturbance, seasonality,
   temperature, vegetation, soils, and landscape connectivity. Various
   groups thus can be used as rapid indicators of different types of change
   in the community, its environment, and the landscape. Threatened and
   rare species also can be used as indicators of the most unique Atlantic
   Forest communities (paleoenvironments), which need special attention.}},

Abstract = {{A demographic study of Cystoseira humilis Kutzing present in a tidepool
   situated on the rocky shore south of Livorno (Ligurian Sea) was carried
   out. In order to assess density, growth, reproduction, mortality and
   biomass of the population, the plants, present in three permanent marked
   squares which had been randomly chosen, were tagged and monitored over
   three years.
   The results suggest that the C. humilis population displayed periods
   characterized by high mortality and low recruitment alternating with
   periods characterized by low mortality and high recruitment. During the
   first year of the study the greatest abundance and growth of plants was
   recorded in spring, while a population decline was observed in the
   autumn-winter period. New plants appeared between October and April.
   Density variations were linked to seasonal fluctuations in recruitment
   and mortality. The seasonal trend of biomass was related to changes in
   density and plant height. In the second year there was a marked decline
   in the entire population of C. humilis due partly to absence of
   recruitment and partly to the high mortality rate during the
   winter-spring period affecting adult and juvenile plants. This high
   mortality coincided with an appreciable decrease both in frond length
   and stem number of the surviving plants, resulting in a marked decrease
   in biomass. In the third year the resulting availability of substratum
   facilitated recruitment. The development of reproductive structures
   showed a seasonal trend throughout the three years of the study. The
   greatest frequency of reproductive individuals occurred in July, while
   in January only sterile plants were found.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of a literature review and new studies in Brandenburg,
   northeast Germany, the status and the genetic structure of the noble
   crayfish Astacus astacus (L.) in Germany are described. The present
   situation is characterized by a patchy distribution comprising at least.
   719 stocks, documented after 1990. Stocks are mainly confined to the
   uppermost stretches of small streams or to small lakes without
   connection to other surface waters. As is typical of Europe,
   geographical isolation, inbreeding and genetic drift may play an
   important role in the population structure of the noble crayfish in
   Germany.
   By means of RAPD-PCR, stocks in Brandenburg (Br1, Br2 and Br3),
   Schleswig-Holstein (SH) and Bavaria (B1 and B2) were analysed for their
   genetic structure. RAPD markers show high ability to separate
   significantly all investigated stocks as single populations. Mean
   non-dimensional distances were 5.8, 5.6 and 4.2 for SH-B, SH-Br and B-Br
   between-region comparisons, respectively. Values for within-region
   comparisons were 3.1 and 1.3 for B-B and Br-Br, respectively. However,
   even the three different lakes located in Brandenburg, which are only
   about 20 km apart from each other, contained significantly
   distinguishable populations.
   So far it is not possible to judge whether the distinct populations
   result from isolation of stocks or indicate local adaptations to the
   specific environmental conditions. The answer to this question is
   important with respect to conservational management and the design of
   restocking programmes. A decision tree for the inventory and monitoring
   of noble crayfish stocks is suggested, since some areas in the northeast
   of Germany may still contain many unknown stocks, which are of
   considerable importance for conservation.}},

Journal = {{BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY}},

Abstract = {{Cnemidophorus tigris punctilinealis of the Sonoran Desert and C. t.
   marmoratus of the Chihuahuan Desert contact each other and interbreed in
   the Animas Valley of southwestern New Mexico. More than 600 specimens
   have been examined from the contact region, and data on biochemical
   genetics (mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, protein electrophoresis of
   nuclear gene products), chromosomes, external morphology (coloration,
   size, scalation), reproduction, and fitness have been compared for three
   hybrid zones. Habitats in the contact region were mapped and
   photographed, and they are discussed in the context of vegetational
   changes during Pleistocene to Recent times, which affected the
   geographic distribution of these animals.
   Data from mitochondrial DNA, allele frequencies at four protein loci (of
   36 analyzed), and body coloration demonstrate that the areas of contact
   have steep, concordant, and coincident step-dines in which most gene
   exchange occurs in hybrid zones that are 3.2-7.8 km wide. Analyses of
   allele frequencies, genotype frequencies, and fixation indices
   (including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage equilibrium, and
   cytonuclear equilibrium) indicate a population structure determined
   primarily by random mating and an absence of selection against hybrids.
   Estimates of gene flow indicate that the dines resulted from neutral
   secondary contact initiated with the newest reconnection of the Sonoran
   and Chihuahuan Deserts within the present interglacial episode, from
   1000 to 5000 years ago. This timeframe is consistent with
   paleoecological data from packrat middens.
   Analyses of karyotypes, morphology, reproduction, and physiology also
   fail to detect differences in fitness among lizards with various
   genotypes. Although it is possible that there are fitness differences
   that are too small to be detected by the sample sizes we employed, the
   data indicate that reproductive success, fitness, and the dynamics of
   populations within the hybrid zones presently are no different from
   those in nonhybrid populations. Earlier data, which suggested that one
   of the step-dines was moving, are not supported.
   The clines are located in fragile semiarid habitats that are subject to
   desertification. Consequently, we present considerable data and dated
   photographs of habitats, precise locations of sampling sites, and local
   allele frequencies, so that future investigators can monitor changes in
   position, width, or dynamics of these hybrid zones.
   In addition, the population genetics data are discussed in the context
   of the following: (1) absence of rare, apparently novel alleles forming
   in the hybrid zones; (2) genetic comparisons with additional subspecies
   of C. tigris (C. t. aethiops and C. t. seprentrionalis); and (3)
   interspecific hybridization between C. tigris and other whiptail lizards
   of either bisexual or unisexual (parthenogenetic, clonal) species.
   Cnemidophorus tigris is one of the ancestors of some of the
   parthenogens, which are of hybrid origin, and our interest in their
   evolutionary history fuels our efforts to improve understanding of
   hybridization among whiptail lizards.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity of dicofol, pyridaben, formetanate HCl, and abamectin to
   European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), was determined using either a
   Petri dish or leaf dip bioassay (as potential field assay procedures)
   and was compared with results from a standard laboratory procedure that
   requires a Potter spray tower to treat leaf disks. Abamectin and
   pyridaben were the most toxic acaricides tested, and dicofol and
   pyridaben were more toxic when applied to Petri dishes than to leaf
   disks. Formetanate HCl was the least toxic acaricide tested by either
   leaf disk or leaf dip procedures. Diagnostic concentrations of pyridaben
   were determined as 5 mg active ingredient per litre (a.i./L) with the
   Petri dish assay and, 15 mg a.i./L with the leaf disk assay. Mortality
   of European red mites to pyridaben at diagnostic concentrations was
   consistently 100\% with thr leaf disk assay and >90\% with the Petri
   dish assay. Residues of pyridaben on Petri dishes stored at 4 degrees C
   in a refrigerator were stable for at least 21 d. For dicofol, both leaf
   disk and Petri dish assays gave similar results, and 25 mg a.i./L,
   previously used as the diagnostic concentration in the Petri dish assay,
   resulted in >99\% mortality of the standard susceptible strain. This
   technique identified resistant individuals in all of the field
   populations tested. Abamectin applied at 2 mg a.i./L to leaf disks
   consistently gave 98-100\% mortality, but results at 2 mg a.i./L with
   the Petri dish assay gave variable results and this was not a reliable
   technique for monitoring resistance. Concentrations of formetanate HCl
   required for the leaf dip assay were too high to be useful in field
   assays; however, all populations of European red mite tested using the
   leaf disk assay appeared susceptible. For the ovicide, clofentezine,
   mortality of eggs tested by the leaf disk assay at 100 or 500 mg a.i./L
   ranged from 89 to 100\%. Results with the leaf dip procedure, using a
   350 mg a.i./L suspension consistently resulted in >96\% mortality of
   eggs from susceptible field populations. These procedures are a useful
   tool in the development of resistance management programs for acaricides
   used in integrated pest management (IPM) systems for tree fruits.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated eight populations of native salmonids to determine if
   rapid, sensitive detection of a reduction in abundance is possible in
   the Yakima River basin, Washington, where a large-scale test of hatchery
   supplementation is being conducted. Prospective power to detect impacts
   to abundance was estimated from 3-16 annual baseline surveys conducted
   by electrofishing, trapping, or snorkeling. High interannual variation
   in abundance estimates (CV = 26-94\%) prevented detection of small
   impacts for most taxa. For three taxa, models of environmental and
   biological influences accounted for between 42 and 49\% of temporal
   variation, increasing our ability to detect impacts of other influences.
   Detectable impacts for a t test with alpha = 0.1 and beta = 0.1 were >
   18\% for all eight taxa and > 54\% for four of eight taxa. We suggest
   that population abundance monitoring may not provide feedback
   sufficiently sensitive or rapid enough to implement corrective actions
   that prevent impacts from causing harm or exceeding an acceptable level,
   especially for rare or highly valued taxa with small acceptable impacts.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of lip neoplasms in populations of white sucker
   (Catostomus commersoni) was compared among five locations in the St.
   Lawrence River basin, Quebec, Canada. One site in the St. Lawrence River
   was monitored from May 15 to October 30 for two consecutive years
   (1994-1995) to study the seasoned variations in the prevalence of lip
   neoplasms. Other sites were sampled within a few days in October 1995 or
   May 1996. Lesions were found in fish from four of the five sites. The
   prevalence at each site varied from 0 to 41.6\% and, as found in the
   Great Lakes, was highest in fish populations from
   urbanized/industrialized sites. Lip neoplams were detected almost only
   in fish >350 mm (total length). The prevalence was slightly higher in
   fish captured in the spring, but the low sample size did not permit
   statistical detection of this seasonal variation. There was a
   significant positive correlation (Spearman r(s) = 0.83) between fish
   length and the prevalence and size of lesions. The prevalence was
   similar between sexes, and the condition factor was significantly lower
   in fish with papillomas from one site only. In future studies, fish size
   and season of capture should be taken into account to compare the
   prevalence of lip neoplasms of white sucker from different sites.}},

Abstract = {{The fish populations of Lake 223, a lake previously acidified to pH 5.1,
   were monitored during 13 years of gradual pH recovery to
   preacidification pH 6.7. During acidification, recruitment ceased for
   all fish species in this lake and two were extirpated. During pH
   recovery, successful recruitment resumed for all fish species that
   remained in the lake. One of the extirpated species, fathead minnow
   (Pimephales promelas), successfully colonized the lake. Lake trout
   (Salvelinus namaycush) abundance decreased during acidification and
   remained low during pH recovery due to very low recruitment. Growth
   curves, condition factor, and annual survival of lake trout decreased
   during acidification and quickly increased to preacidification values
   during pH recovery. During the early years of pH recovery, white sucker
   (Catostomus commersoni) abundance increased to almost 10 times the
   number at the start of the experiment but decreased during the final
   years due to decreased annual survival and recruitment. Pearl dace
   (Margariscus margarita) became abundant during acidification and their
   abundance decreased during pH recovery as fathead minnow abundance
   increased. Other fish species that were caught infrequently prior to
   acidification, brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans), lake chub
   (Couesius plumbeus), and finescale dace (Phoxinus neogaeus), were caught
   frequently during pH recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The monitoring and management of sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus)
   populations have proved problematic. Studies of living animals indicate
   that movements are largely determined by resource availability, thus
   suggesting that density-dependent habitat selection may be a realistic
   framework within which to study sperm whale populations. A model, in
   which animals migrate between 2 + 2 degrees squares at rates that depend
   on relative resource availability, was used to examine the effects of
   whaling on measures of sperm whale abundance. The model simulated four
   types of whaling: shore-based whaling, pelagic open-boat whaling by many
   boats, pelagic whaling by a fleet based around one factory ship, and
   pelagic whaling by a fleet sequentially exploiting different parts of
   the study area. Catch per unit effort was found to have little
   relationship with population size in any part of the study area for
   shore-based whaling and for pelagic whaling when the study area was
   sequentially exploited. Thus, in these circumstances, catch per unit
   effort should not be used as a measure of depletion. To give a
   reasonable assessment of depletion, visual or acoustic surveys must
   extend well beyond the areas being exploited.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for monitoring progress toward recovery goals are highly
   variable and may be problematic for endangered species that are mobile
   and widely distributed. Recovery objectives for Piping Plovers
   (Charadrius melodus) include attainment of minimum population sizes
   within specified recovery units, as determined by two U.S. and two
   Canadian recovery teams. To assess progress toward these goals, complete
   surveys of the species' winter and breeding ranges in Canada, the United
   States, Mexico, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles are conducted
   every 5 years. In 1996, 1200 biologists and volunteers participated in
   the second International Piping Plover Census, tallying 2515 wintering
   birds and 5913 adults (2668 breeding pairs) during the breeding census.
   Winter numbers were 27\% lower than those of the first international
   census conducted in 1991, with substantially fewer wintering birds along
   the Gulf of Mexico and an overall increase in numbers along the Atlantic
   Coast. Large numbers of wintering plovers remain undetected. In 1996,
   the total number of breeding adults was 7.7\% higher than in 1991.
   Regionally, breeding numbers were 31\% higher along the Atlantic Coast
   and 20\% higher in the small Great Lakes population, but declined by 5\%
   in the U.S. Great Plains and the Canadian Prairie. Target recovery
   numbers were met only for Saskatchewan but were approached in Alberta
   and New England. The results suggest that Piping Plover distribution and
   habitat use in the U.S. Great Plains/Canadian Prairie region may shift
   dramatically with water conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We employed biogeochemical monitoring tools to study the fate and effect
   of PAHs in two wetlands at the Former Kopper's Site (wood treatment) in
   Charleston, SC. PAH mineralization assays and microbial productivity
   measurements (H-3-leucine incorporation) were combined with GC/MS
   analysis of sediment PAH and other contaminant concentrations.
   C-14-naphthalene, C-14-phenanthrene and C-14- fluoranthene were added at
   tracer concentrations to wetland sediments to determine the in situ PAH
   biodegradation rate. Bacterial productivity was measured to determine
   the overall carbon demand (natural plus PAH) for the microbial
   assemblage. These analyses were conducted before source reduction
   operations, which were performed in the Southwest tidal marsh area in
   the spring of 1999. The site was resampled in June 1999 and October
   1999. Both the Northwest and South Tidal Marsh area showed elevated PAH
   concentrations and demonstrated significant PAH mineralization (as
   measured by NAP, PHE and FLA degradation) before and after source
   removal. The highest PAH mineralization rates were observed in October,
   well after the source removal event. Bacterial productivity increased in
   June 1999 (after source removal), but was at its pre-removal rate by
   October 1999, Bacterial productivity appeared most correlated with
   temperature, but showed inhibition at higher PAH concentrations. By
   relating PAH concentration and biodegradation to the amount of carbon
   metabolism (demand), the importance of PAH as a carbon source may be
   determined relative to other pools of carbon available to the microbial
   assemblage. These percentages were highest in October 1999. We conclude
   that source removal most likely disrupted the microbial assembleges
   intially, but population recovery has led to a more actively remediating
   consortium, which utilizes PAH as a carbon source.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of demersal fish at inshore sites of the South Shetland
   Islands has continued at Potter Cove from 1991 to 1999, and at Harmony
   Cove, Nelson Island, in the austral summer of 1995/96. Still evident is
   the decline in trammel-net catches of fjord-dwelling Notothenia rossii
   and Gobionotothen gibberifrons in relation to the non-commercially
   fished Notothenia coriiceps, which was previously reported for the
   period 1983-1990. A trend of increasing N. rossii catches was observed,
   but the levels of relative abundance of this species and G. gibberifrons
   are well below those found in the early 1980s. These results are
   supported by our knowledge about the diet of the piscivorous Antarctic
   shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis) in the South Shetland-Antarctic
   Peninsula area in this decade. The decrease in recruitment to the
   inshore sub-populations of N. rossii and G. gibberifrons over the last
   16 years was most probably caused by the offshore commercial fishery in
   the area in the late 1970s. This interpretation is consistent with
   historical information on offshore commercial fishing and with the
   results of scientific surveys in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding biogeochemical processes in salt marshes will help
   elucidate their role as essential habitats. Since microbial activity
   accounts for nearly all of the biogeochemical cycling that occurs in the
   marsh environment, monitoring bacteria and their activity is fundamental
   to assessing marshes as sites for biogeochemical change. In the past,
   this has been accomplished using approaches that estimated the average
   response of the entire population of micro-organisms. These studies have
   proven very useful for computing overall fluxes and secondary
   production. However, questions of diversity, population dynamics,
   microbial ecology, and the role of specific bacteria responsible for a
   biogeochemical transformation have been difficult to approach using the
   traditional, bulk rate techniques. The recent revolution in biochemical
   methods has allowed microbiologists to now identify specific groups of
   bacteria in a natural sample. This is done by targeting specific
   macromolecules in the bacterial cells such as fatty acids, proteins, and
   nucleic acids to characterize the various microbial members of or
   community independent of the other bacteria and eukaryotes present in
   the sample. Such studies have begun to provide information on the
   variety, distribution, and gene regulation of particular bacteria
   responsible for a given biogeochemical process. Although a comprehensive
   overview of molecular techniques will not be feasible in this chapter,
   we shall discuss some principles of applying biochemical analysis to
   complex microbial communities. It is hoped the data obtained from
   molecular studies in marsh habitats in the future will lead to a better
   understanding of the linkages between the structure and the function of
   the microbial communities that mediate biogeochemical cycling in the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The success of salt marsh restoration, especially as it relates to the
   structural and functional role of fish populations, is poorly defined.
   In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the restoration of a former
   salt hay farm toward a functional marsh, we monitored the fish response
   to the restoration (resumed tidal flow, creation of creeks) from
   September 1996 to November 1997 and compared that to the prerestoration
   condition. During the post-restoration period we compared fish species
   richness, abundance, composition and size during the spring, summer and
   fall between the restored site and an adjacent reference marsh with
   similar physical characteristics (temperature, salinity, dissolved
   oxygen, depth, distance from the bay). Fish populations, primarily
   young-of-the-year, were characterized at both sites by monthly sampling
   with replicate (4 tows per site, 2 sites in each of two creeks) daytime
   otter trawls (4.9 m, 6 mm cod end mesh, n=375 two-minute tows) in large
   marsh creeks and with weirs (2.0 m x 1.5 m x 1.5 m, with 5.0 m x 1.5 m
   wings, 6.0 mm mesh, n=48) in smaller intertidal marsh creeks (2 sites in
   the restored marsh, 4 sites in reference marshes). Based on these
   observations, fish abundance was greater in the restored creeks while
   species richness, species composition, and average size of fishes were
   similar to the reference site. An analysis of fish assemblages at the
   same sites indicated that the reference and restored marshes were
   similar for large and small marsh creeks. Where differences occurred it
   was often the result of greater abundances of selected species at the
   restored marsh. Also, during this period the standing stock at the
   restored marsh may have exceeded that for the reference marsh. Thus, it
   appears that the fish responded quickly to the restoration.}},

Abstract = {{The concept ``cleaner technology{''} implies the introduction and
   application of technology with less negative impact on the environment
   than the technology so far applied. The major factors of negative
   environmental impact of the wood processing industry include emission of
   fumes from organic solvents from the finishing process, emission of
   dust, and high noise levels. Further, the industry has many serious
   accidents and risks to the workers' health through exposure to chemical
   fumes and dust. The industry produces substantial amounts of wood and
   chemical waste, and often has excessive consumption of materials and
   energy. Applied cleaner technology involves constructive cooperation
   between government institutions and companies/industry organizations in
   demonstrating and disseminating solutions which are improvements in real
   terms. Applied cleaner technology has been part of a systematic effort
   to improve the environmental performance of the wood processing industry
   in Denmark, coordinated and occasionally funded by the Danish Ministry
   of Environment in the period 1987-92. The results have been promising
   with regard to dissemination of cleaner technologies, e.g. in the use of
   water-based surface treatment materials which have come into substantial
   use during the policy period. The benefits for companies include
   recognition from the authorities for improvement efforts, easier
   compliance with increasingly tighter environmental regulations,
   financial gains through reduced resource consumption and increased
   productivity. The companies also see a benefit in being able to document
   an environmentally clean profile in a world whose population is
   increasingly aware of the environment. The Enwind project has
   established a method for analyzing a company's environmental performance
   and has linked the analysis to a technical advisory service which can
   assist companies to introduce environmental improvements and
   continuously monitor progress. Preliminary experience with
   implementation has also been gained.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a method to isolate and analyze nascent human
   reticulocytes in peripheral blood For the presence of micronuclei (MN).
   For a very short time peripheral reticulocytes show residual expression
   of the transferrin receptor. Using immunomagnetic separation of cells
   expressing the transferrin receptor, a population of immature
   reticulocytes (Trf-Ret) was isolated From peripheral blood. In humans,
   the spleen actively removes micronucleated erythrocytes but during the
   short lifetime of the isolated Trf-Ret only a fraction (less than about
   20\%) of the MN-containing reticulocytes will have been eliminated.
   Cells were stained with the fluorescent dyes Thiazole Orange for RNA and
   Hoechst 33342 For DNA and analyzed by flow cytometry and fluorescence
   microscopy. Baseline Frequencies of MN-Trf Ret on a group of healthy
   donors were found to be 1.1\% for males and 1.4\% for females; however,
   the gender difference was not significant. The frequency of MN-Trf-Ret
   in the studied group increased with age, and was dependent on blood
   group. In three donors studied over 4 months, the baseline level
   remained stable. In cancer patients treated with radiation or
   chemotherapy, the frequency of MN-Trf-Ret increased 10-to 20-fold after
   1-4 days, depending on the treatment. A high correlation between flow
   and manual analysis of MN-Trf-Ret was seen. We believe the method has a
   high potential as a sensitive and rapid method for biological monitoring
   in presumed exposed groups and individuals. Environ. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Coal is a mixture of a variety of chemicals, especially hydrocarbons,
   which may give rise to poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Many PAH
   compounds produce mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. The quality of
   mineral coal in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) is low and it is typically
   obtained by stripping operations; it represents approximately 87\% of
   the Brazil reserves. This report concerns the application of the Comet
   assay to Ctenomys torquatus to detect the effects of coal, comparing the
   results with a micronucleus (MN) assay, both using peripheral blood.
   This study was performed over a 2-year period in an attempt to evaluate
   seasonal patterns. The wild rodent is fossorial, and its geographic
   distribution in RS coincides with the distribution of coal reserves.
   Three localitions were studied: two coal fields, Butia (in a strip cool
   mine region) and Candiota (near a strip coal mine), and one control
   region, Pelotas (no coal). At the end of 2 years, 240 rodents had been
   analyzed. Our results showed that coal and derivatives induced DNA and
   chromosomal lesions in rodent cells that were demonstrated by Comet and
   MN assays. These tests also demonstrated quantitative differences
   between field exposures (Candiota > Butia). The Comet assay was more
   sensitive and also showed a direct relationship between age and damage,
   and an inverse relationship between temperature and damage index. (C)

Abstract = {{During the 20(th) century, the very fast growth of urban population
   created environmental problems in rivers, streams and in some coastal
   areas (estuaries and coastal lagoons). A Directive for Urban Residual
   Waters has been issued by DC Environment in 1992 and is being
   implemented.
   This directive imposes a minimum level of treatment, for each size of
   the agglomeration. Agglomerations with more than 150 000 inhabitants
   must have secondary treatment. Exceptions to this directive can only be
   considered in special circumstances and it must be demonstrated that
   this level of treatment does not produce any environmental benefit
   compared with a primary treatment.
   In the framework of different projects (e.g. OPCOM) a modelling system
   including hydrodynamics, sediment transport and water quality is being
   used as a tool to help understanding the functioning of coastal
   wastewater disposal systems. As a result of the implementation of such a
   system it is possible to evaluate the efficiency of the wastewater
   treatment method as a function of the receiving water properties.
   In this paper it is shown how this integrated modelling system,
   complemented by monitoring programs and a web database, can be used to
   demonstrate the existence of the special circumstances mentioned in the
   European Directive for Residual Waters.}},

Title = {{Problems in extinction model selection and parameter estimation}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{S55-S73}},
Abstract = {{It is a vexing problem to achieve a consensus about the proper
   scientific way to assess population viability for habitat conservation
   plans. Rather than a hypothesis-testing approach, here it is proposed to
   select population models, estimate extinction parameters, and assess
   prediction uncertainty using a pragmatic, empirical Bayesian approach.
   The simplest usable models include the effects of population growth, r;
   carrying capacity, K; Allee threshold, N-A; and environmental
   stochasticity, v(r). Analytic predictions of expected extinction times
   are available for such models. Models that are more complex can be
   elaborated from this basis. Selection from a hierarchy of nesting
   population models can often be done through the evaluation of
   parameters. The estimation of the most important extinction parameters
   can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Time series can be analyzed to
   estimate r(d), v(r), rho, and K. Habitat models and individualistic
   population models may help estimate N, and K and demographic
   stochasticity. Fine-scale biogeography and climatological data may be
   useful in the estimation of a variety of parameters. Because it takes
   many years to estimate extinction parameters accurately for a given
   population of interest, the most efficient estimation procedures are
   desirable. I propose the use of prior information from an (as yet
   nonexistent) population biology database. The accumulation of local
   information through monitoring will improve our estimates allowing
   adaptive management. Uncertainty in the estimates will always remain,
   but it may be quantified by the posterior distributions. A crude example
   is discussed using treefrog population data. Although the motivations,
   beliefs, and biases of competing stakeholders will differ, a habitat
   conservation plan could accommodate this variation in the prior
   distributions. Field experience from monitoring will increasingly clear
   up any discrepancies between the opposing beliefs and the real
   ecosystem. As the world is an uncertain place and because there is no
   universal scientific method, there will always be controversy and
   surprises. The best we can do is (1) agree about our prior information,
   (2) agree about the strategy of model selection and parameter
   estimation, and (3) agree about our strategy for adaptive management.
   Perhaps the greatest impediment to such prior agreements for HCPs is the
   likely paranoia inspired by the use of unfamiliar statistical
   methodology. We need to train students of ecology in a more flexible and
   deeper understanding of statistics and philosophy of science.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, an important number of episodes with peak
   nitrogen dioxide levels occurred in the Paris region. Modelling air
   pollution is necessary to predict future episodes and to take decisions
   for the protection of populations. Our study proposes a methodology for
   urban air pollution analysis, as a preliminary stage of its modelling.
   This paper focuses on two major points: the estimation of pollutant
   concentration fields using measures from a monitoring network, and the
   definition of a reduced number of concentration spatial patterns.
   Interpolation by thin plate splines is proposed and the approximation
   quality is estimated by leave-one-out cross validation tests. Analysis
   of large numbers of pollutant fields is difficult: cluster analysis of
   spatial distributions is proposed. For this study, Ward's algorithm is
   selected and applied to AIRPARIF nitrogen dioxide data during peak
   episodes from January 1993 to December 1997. Finally, some results and
   conclusions are presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Monitoring nitrogen dioxide and its effects on asthmatic patients: Two
   different strategies compared}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{447-458}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To develop a `methodology assessment' to evaluate the
   strengths and the weaknesses of two different epidemiological approaches
   and to identify the best suited monitoring strategy to measure the
   effects of `normal levels' of nitrogen dioxide exposure on the health of
   an urban population. Methodology: all exposures to nitrogen dioxide were
   determined with passive samplers, each sampler consisting of 3 measuring
   Palmes tubes. In the first study the nitrogen dioxide exposure was
   assessed in 23 school children (11 asthmatic and 12 non asthmatic).
   Children wore samplers for a week and parallel measurements were made in
   their kitchens, in bedrooms and outside their homes. The second study
   consisted in a case-control study where the relative risk of hospital
   admission was calculated considering nitrogen dioxide levels in a city
   of northern Italy. 110 asthmatic patients were compared to a control
   group of 5322 people. Results: Personal sampler measurements highlighted
   significant differences in exposure when nitrogen dioxide atmospheric
   levels were compared in asthmatic and healthy children (p < 0.05). No
   other parameters were significant in the two groups. A significant
   action of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide on hospital admission was
   demonstrated (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Although a cause-effect relation
   as such cannot be identified, the studies show a relation between the
   exposure to nitrogen dioxide and the presence of adverse effects on
   people's health. However the `disadvantage' is for subjects with
   asthmatic pathologies, compared to the others. To manage this problem
   most effectively, a combined approach with the activation of specific
   personal monitoring campaigns of the subjects with verified risk seems
   necessary. This requires `reading' the data resulting from most
   extensive and up to date information systems, capable of a thorough
   control both of the living environment and of the clinical outcome of
   the whole population.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},

Pages = {{135-145}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have documented contaminant-induced alterations in
   host-parasite relationships of vertebrate hosts in aquatic environments,
   suggesting this functional relationship may be useful for monitoring
   community-level effects of stressors in terrestrial systems. We
   hypothesized that gastrointestinal helminth communities of hispid cotton
   rat (Sigmodon hispidus) hosts would be sensitive to exposure to complex
   mixtures of petrochemicals in soils of tallgrass prairie habitats
   contaminated with oil refinery wastes. Parasite communities were
   surveyed (1993-95) on three contaminated and two reference sites on an
   oil refinery complex in Oklahoma. Abundance of Schizotaenia sigmodontis
   infections was two-fold higher in hosts from reference than contaminated
   sites. Strongyloides sigmodontis exhibited pronounced seasonal
   differences in prevalence and abundance in host populations from
   reference sites, with much higher seasonal variation compared to hosts
   from contaminated sites. Other helminth species, including Schizotaenia
   sigmodontis, Protospirura muris, Longistriata adunca, also exhibited
   seasonal fluctuations in abundance. Differences in species richness and
   composition were also observed, with hosts from the reference sites
   consistently supporting a higher mean number of species compared to
   those from contaminated sites. Differences in community structure
   indicate that host-parasite relationships can provide another useful
   method for monitoring community-level impacts of contamination in a
   terrestrial system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The insectivorous tree swallow was chosen as an indicator species to
   investigate the uptake of pulp mill-related chlorinated hydrocarbons
   from emergent aquatic insects. Nest box populations were monitored for
   reproductive success at locations upstream and downstream of pulp mills
   on two river systems in British Columbia, Canada. Also, 16-day-old
   nestlings were collected and analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans
   (PCDFs), pesticides, chlorophenols and chloroguaiacols. Most
   reproductive parameters were not different between populations at
   upstream and downstream locations, and were equivalent to or greater
   than those recorded for other tree swallow populations. Chlorinated
   hydrocarbon contamination of nestlings was low at all sites. The highest
   tissue concentrations were detected downstream of pulp mills on the
   Fraser River, where PCDD and PCDF patterns along with the presence of
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) suggested that the primary source of
   contaminants was past use of PCP for timber preservation. Although the
   absolute tissue concentration of contaminants was less, the toxic
   concentration (as estimated with I-TEQs) was greatest in nestlings
   downstream of a pulp mill on the Thompson River. The proportionately
   larger contributions from 2,3,7,8-TCDF and PCB-77 elevated these TEQs in
   comparison to other populations. Nest success was the one reproductive
   measure that showed substantial reductions in downstream populations on
   both rivers; however, there was little indication that nest failures
   were the direct result of contamination. Failures were largely due to
   parental abandonment, and, while poor parental attentiveness and nest
   abandonment have been associated with chlorinated hydrocarbon tissue
   concentrations in other studies, our 1-year assessment was insufficient
   to establish any link with pulp mill effluent exposure. Nestling growth
   models showed some subtle differences in growth patterns between nest
   box populations on the two rivers, but an association with pulp mill
   effects on aquatic insect prey availability was not established. (C)

Abstract = {{A survey of groundwater and stream water quality was undertaken in a
   stock farming area where livestock wastewater infiltrates into sandy
   unsaturated zones and saturated bedrock aquifers containing fractures.
   To determine the degree of contamination and track the effect of
   livestock wastewater on groundwater and stream water quality, the
   population of indicator bacteria (total coliforms, fecal coliforms,
   fecal streptococci, Staphylococcus spp., and sulfite-reducing
   clostridia) together with relevant physicochemical parameters were
   monitored along the wastewater flow-pathways over a 19-month period. The
   stream water was severely contaminated with livestock wastewater. Nearly
   all physicochemical and bacteriological parameters in the stream water
   were much greater than those in the groundwater. Nitrate-N
   concentrations ranged from 10.0 to 20.0 mg l(-1) in boreholes located
   downstream (site C) from the livestock waste disposal site, while those
   in the background borehole (W2) were below 1.0 mg l(-1). Densities of
   indicator bacteria in boreholes at site C were two or three orders of
   magnitude higher than those in W2 borehole. In boreholes located
   downstream from the livestock waste disposal site, the concentration of
   ammonium-N, nitrate-N, and pollution indicator bacteria increased as
   groundwater level rose due to infiltration of rainwater. In W2 borehole,
   however, physicochemical parameters and the number of pollution
   indicator bacteria had no correlation with the groundwater level.
   Collectively, these results suggest that the deep aquifers were heavily
   contaminated with infiltrated livestock wastewater, which consequently
   must be adequately treated to minimize groundwater pollution. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{In recent years, populations of resident aquatic species in California's
   Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, USA, have declined appreciably in numbers.
   The cause of these declines is not known, but has been attributed to a
   number of factors including water diversions, loss of habitat,
   introduced exotic organisms, and toxic compounds. To detect and
   characterize the spatial extent, severity, frequency, and causes of
   potential toxicity caused by anthropogenic pollutants, a monitoring
   study was conducted over a period of two years (1993-1995). Sites were
   monitored on a monthly basis using the standardized U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency freshwater toxicity test with the zooplankton species
   Ceriodaphnia dubia. Twenty-four sites were sampled in 1993 to 1994.
   During the 1994 to 1995 sampling season, the number of sampling sites
   was restricted to 20, with special emphasis placed on back sloughs,
   delta island agricultural drains, and main-stem river sites. Significant
   mortality or reproductive toxicity in C. dubia was detected in 9.8\% of
   400 water samples tested. Ecologically important back sloughs had the
   largest percentage of toxic samples. Of 71 and 103 samples collected
   from back sloughs during 1993 to 1994 and 1994 to 1995, respectively,
   14.1\% and 19.68 were toxic. To determine the causative chemical(s),
   toxicity identification evaluations (TIEs) were conducted on 23 toxic
   samples. These included eight follow-up samples taken to determine
   whether toxicity at the respective site persisted. Organophosphate
   (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, malathion) and carbamate (carbofuran, carbaryl)
   pesticides were identified as primary toxicants. Chlorpyrifos was
   present at toxic concentrations in 87\% of samples tested by TIE.
   Analysis of data from the follow-up samples suggested that toxicity may
   have persisted over periods of several days to weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid effluent monitoring for research and development laboratories is
   difficult because of the diverse and variable effluent streams and wide
   range of chemicals used in continuously changing projects. Risk
   assessment tools can aid in the design of reasonable monitoring
   programs. In this paper, an assessment was performed to determine the
   human health risk of accidental discharges of chemicals into the sewer
   systems servicing research and development laboratories at the Hanford
   Site's 300 Area. As part of this assessment, the single largest
   container of chemical compounds used in the laboratories was assumed to
   be discharged into the sewer system transported to a treatment facility,
   then pass untreated into the Columbia River. The Multimedia
   Environmental Pollutant Assessment System was used to model the
   transport and fate of the chemical contaminants, and exposure estimates
   were obtained for two receptor locations and for population impacts.
   Results of this assessment indicated that the human health risk from the
   source terms analyzed would not exceed levels generally accepted as safe
   and that no additional controls or monitoring of specific chemicals were
   indicated from this risk perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination of aquatic systems by metals and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a prevalent environmental problem. These
   contaminants are known to impact populations, organismal health, and
   survival negatively. Most of the organism and ecosystem level changes
   are a consequence of underlying molecular and subcellular damage.
   Therefore, molecular bioindicators are likely to be a sensitive tool for
   environmental assessment. We have demonstrated that both copper and
   phenanthrenequinone (PHEQ) alter protein expression in Daphnia magna. To
   investigate altered gene expression in Daphnia magna exposed to copper,
   PHEQ, acid other contaminants, a technique based on the differential
   display polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is being developed for D.
   magna. This technique promises numerous applications as it permits a
   survey of the genes being expressed in any given organism. Furthermore,
   ddPCR allows one to monitor the changes in gene expression that result
   from any toxicant exposure. This paper reviews the applications of ddPCR
   and describes our development of ddPCR as a bioindicator of gene
   expression in D. magna in response to toxicant exposure. This is the
   first step in the development of a novel gene fingerprinting technique
   that can be applied to any compound and organism of interest.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-instrumental array constructed in the Laboratoire d'Ecologie du
   Plancton Marin in Villefranche sur mer, France, named the Underwater
   Video Profiler (WP), was used to investigate the vertical distribution
   of zooplankton in four western Norwegian fjords in the summer 1996. Six
   distinct zoological groups were monitored. The fauna included: (a) small
   crustaceans (mainly copepods), (b) ctenophores (mainly lobates), (c)
   siphonophores (mainly physonects), (d) a scyphomedusa Periphylla
   periphylla, (e) chaetognaths and (f) appendicularians.
   The use of the non-disturbing video technique demonstrated that the
   distribution of large zooplankton is heterogeneous vertically and
   geographically. Furthermore, the abundance of non-migrating filter
   feeders in the deep basins of the fjords indicates that there is enough
   food (living and non-living particulate organic matter) to support their
   dietary needs. This adaptation may be considered as a strategy for
   survival in fjords. Specifically, living in dark, deep water reduces
   visual predation and population loss encountered in the upper layer due
   to advective processes. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans was monitored in field
   plots of potato genotypes selected from population A of the
   International Potato Center (CIP) germplasm collection. Disease severity
   was measured as percent blighted leaf area and used to compute area
   under disease progress curves (AUDPC), apparent infection rates (r) and
   severity at epidemic onset (Yo). AUDPCs revealed more distinct
   differences among the genotypes than any other disease assessment
   parameter. Percent disease severity measured 67-77 days after planting
   (D67-77) explained more variation in AUDPCs than measurements made on
   any other single day. Increase in percent diseased leaves fit the
   monomolecular model more closely than the Gompertz, logistic or
   exponential model. All disease assessment parameters varied among the
   genotypes and were significantly (p < 0.01) correlated with each other.
   Genotypes with larger AUDPCs generally had higher DS67-77 and faster
   rates of disease increase (r). Clones 386191.7 and 381403.23 were more
   susceptible to late blight than all other entries tested. The lowest
   disease levels were observed on clone 382155.2. Frequency distribution
   of AUDPCs among genotypes appeared continuous and did not differ
   significantly (p < 0.05) from normal distribution suggesting the
   observed resistance may be attributable to minor genes.}},

Abstract = {{An economically and environmentally-sound approach to the management of
   a serious turfgrass pest to golf courses is effectively developed
   through an improved understanding of the pests biology and behavior. The
   subterranean turf pests in the group called mole crickets cause
   significant turf damage throughout the southeastern United States. The
   underground habitat of this pest renders this group both difficult and
   expensive to monitor and control. The development of a sound data base
   of mole cricket biology, ecology, and behavior is critical for the
   development an effective management plan. The use of a multi-tactic
   management approach is essential to provide the desired level of
   population suppression in an environmentally sound manner. The findings
   of a broad research effort (1993-1998) directed at mole crickets on golf
   courses have permitted the integration of new strategies into an
   effective management program.}},

Abstract = {{In the case of accidents at chemical plants, during transportation of
   chemicals or during terrorist attacks, hazardous compounds may be
   released and may harm emergency personnel and population. To prevent
   this a simple chemical hazard monitor is required to help locate the
   dangerous area, its border, and the safe area, as recently pointed out
   by Overton(1) in a FACT editorial.
   Normally, only one or a few compounds are released, but a wide range of
   compounds has to be considered and must be measurable. In such cases,
   single-compound detectors may not provide any information or may provide
   misleading information. Alternative systems that determine sum
   parameters will give insufficient information to make a decision plan
   for environmental-protection activities or intervention by firefighters.
   However, there is always the danger of failing to detect important toxic
   substances if only one sensing technology is used.
   In principle, all relevant compounds can be measured at low
   concentrations by laboratory analysis. However, techniques for task
   forces in the field are usually limited to simple equipment(2,3) and are
   useful for only a limited range of substances. Making laboratory
   analytical techniques available to the firefighter is the first
   successful step in accident analysis. However, devices such as mobile
   GC/MS and optical systems(4,5) need to be operated by specially trained
   personnel. Furthermore, because of relatively high costs only few
   special-purpose forces use this equipment.
   Given the large amount of chemical hazardous compounds produced nowadays
   and the frequency of accidents reported in the past and anticipated
   accidents in the future, guidelines with lists of the major fraction of
   hazardous substances have been established in the United States
   (Emergency Response Planning Guidelines, ERPG2(6)) and in Germany
   (Einsatz Toleranz-Werte: ETW, tolerable concentration values'). In
   addition to the substances in these lists, chemical warfare agents have
   to be considered, for example, in the case of terrorism. Detecting these
   substances in the field has been the objective of incident detection and
   measurement device developments One result of our development efforts is
   the portable gas detector array (GDA). Its analytical task, selected
   sensors, signal interpretation, and measuring strategy as well as first
   experiences from the fire brigades using the prototype instruments are
   presented here. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Disjunct populations of the perennial herb Gypsophila fastigiata L.
   (Caryophyllaceae) on the Baltic island of bland were monitored during a
   thirteen-year study. The main objectives were to analyze the dynamic
   features of G. fastigiata within and among sub-populations in shorter
   and longer time perspectives, and to relate this to habitat
   characteristics and patterns in local weather variation. The total
   number of individuals decreased and the proportion of reproductive
   individuals increased throughout the study period. Recruitment and
   mortality on a fine spatial scale (0.25 m(2)) were negatively correlated
   to species richness and vegetation cover. Rapid changes in population
   sizes were observed during and after summers with low precipitation. The
   highest mortality rates were found in pre-reproductive stages whereas
   relatively many of the adult plants survived the droughts. The long-term
   trend of population decline in G. fastigiata could be a result of
   changes in vegetation structure due to changing grazing regimes. It
   might also be an effect of more frequent dry summers during the second
   half of the observation period or of an interaction between weather and
   changes in management. Another interpretation is that dynamic processes
   are taking place on a geographic scale not covered in the present study.}},

Abstract = {{Bangladesh is a nation of over 125 million population with a
   geographical area of 1,48,393 km(2) and located on the Ganges,
   Brahmaputra, and Meghna Delta. The major part of the country is now
   severely affected by mass poisoning from arsenic in groundwater. The
   latest statistics on the arsenic contamination in groundwater indicates
   that 59 out of 64 districts, about 80\% of the total area of Bangladesh
   and about 40 million people are at risk. Presently about 116 million
   people depend on water from tube-wells for drinking, cooking, washing
   and bathing and about 60 million people are drinking and using arsenic
   contaminated groundwater. Arsenic level now ranges from 0 ppm to 0.98
   ppm and the maximum permissible level of arsenic in Bangladesh drinking
   water is 0.05 ppm. Average values of different tubewells data on thana
   census blocks have been used in this study. A spatial and temporal
   distribution of Groundwater Arsenic Contamination Intensity (GACI) has
   been developed using Geographical Information System (GIS) in order to
   assist decision making process in some critical areas, particularly to
   protect human health. The digitized thana boundary maps with
   longitude-latitude coordinates storing information in the form of
   metadata has also been developed to visualize GACI information in thana
   census blocks of Bangladesh. The MapBasic Professional 4.5 has used for
   developing user-interface design and MapInfo Professional 4.5 for the
   visualization of spatial information. The user-interface GIS approach
   can help policy makers deciding proper groundwater utilization and
   taking necessary steps to supplying safe drinking water to the domestic
   and industrial areas.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fulfil the requirements for agricultural, domestic and
   industrial purposes, the dependency on groundwater in North India is
   rapidly increasing. Agriculture being the main source of livelihood of
   the rural population, heavy dependence on groundwater is evident from
   the fact that 95 \% of the total irrigated area receives groundwater
   irrigation. A few prominent questions which the planners and decision
   makers are confronted with relate to the quantity and quality of
   groundwater. Other factors include location of recharge in intake areas,
   temporal and spatial variability of recharge, inter-linkage between
   groundwater and surface water, existing hydraulic gradients and water
   table situation, groundwater flow between different formations, etc.
   Groundwater has experienced major problems resulting from indiscriminate
   exploitation as well as combination of imprudent irrigation, different
   pollution sources such as urban runoff, nitrogenous fertilisers used in
   agriculture, seepage from contaminated industrial sites and industrial
   discharges. Enhancement in water availability and safe water supply
   should always be guided by the effective public policies, plans and
   local technologies, in addition to political, socioeconomic and other
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first published comparative growth-rates for the
   Joshua Tree, Yucca brevifolia, measured in the field in three plots in
   the Mojave Desert in 1975, 1985, and 1995. Numerous variables were
   measured: height growth-rates varied among populations, years, and
   age-form classes; leaf-cluster number, stem-heights, and diameters
   increased. Height increments averaged about four cm/yr for all locations
   and time intervals. Based on our data, we predict the ultimate height
   and leaf-cluster number for mature plants at our site in the Cima Dome
   area. We conclude that a 20-year study of this long-lived species only
   begins to provide insights into its demography.
   A long-lived desert perennial requires demographic data obtained over a
   long time-period. This is the first published study to monitor
   population dynamics for this species over a 20-year period. Without
   access to growth rings, we developed ``age-form{''} classes to reflect
   stages in the species' life history and as one basis for comparison. Few
   plants died and no recruitment was evident. The populations had a fairly
   constant age-form structure over the 20-year interval.}},

Abstract = {{Waste deposit sites and incinerators, the two main disposal routes of
   waste today, raise important health concerns. Therefore, the questions
   if and to what extent new projects in the waste management area will

   This paper describes how to deal with these questions. Two main aspects
   are considered:
   a. the health impact assessment (HIA) methodology, which allows the
   forecasting of possible health effects of new projects, plans,
   programmes or policies;
   b. the integration of HIA into the general environmental impact
   assessment process. In particular, the specific points on HIA to be
   addressed during the different procedural EIA steps are described.
   HIA is analysed as a six-step process entailing the description of the
   project site in a way which allows the identification of the vulnerable
   groups to be studied; the identification of the changes in the
   environment relevant to the health of the population; the identification
   and quantification of the exposure and the dose; the prediction of the
   relevant health effects; the evaluation of these predictions; the
   mitigating measures and post project analysis including monitoring and
   surveillance.
   Integrating HIA in EIA is a matter of focussing on the three main
   objectives of HIA (identification of health hazards, interpretation of
   these hazards as risks and management of the health risks) and their
   realisation throughout the EIA procedure. It is shown that in particular
   scoping, setting up the terms of reference, the preparation of the
   environmental impact statement, the public participation and the post
   project analysis are the main phases during which specific HIA elements
   need to be explicitly addressed.
   Although the application of HIA looks like the most promising way to
   deal with important questions with which society confronts policy
   makers, its full application will strongly depend upon the application
   of good practice methods, more research, more attention to quality
   control in ELA and better targeted education and training on these
   subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are at the top of the food web, and are therefore particularly
   vulnerable to exposure to those pollutants that are persistent and which
   bioconcentrate. The major route of human intake of these compounds is
   food of animal origin. Release and cycling of these compounds in the
   human food chain is an important problem.
   Therefore this chapter is intended to give insight into the complex
   issue of `waste as a source for environmental contaminants', with
   particular emphasis on the accumulation and effects of environmental
   contaminants on wildlife and domestic animals and the relevance for
   human health. Examples and studies related to the release of toxic
   substances into the environment are reported and accordingly waste
   sources and types are classified. Additionally a list of substances
   involved is provided, which represent examples of relevant groups of
   pollutants.
   Monitoring the health status and contamination of a wildlife population
   can be an important tool in early warning systems, in order to protect
   human health. Effects on wildlife populations, if observed, can point to
   environmental problems long before effects in humans might be observed.
   Animal species can be used as indicators for pollution.
   Waste management and its effects on human health are global problems.
   This is because of factors such as: global distillation of compounds,
   the global trade of animal feed, animal products, waste (legal or
   illegal) and, last but not least, global tourism. Therefore this is a
   problem that cannot be solved solely on a national basis but only by an
   international co-operation in identifying sources, decreasing or
   stopping emissions and developing strategies to avoid the intake of
   hazardous amounts of contaminants.
   In conclusion, strategies for the avoidance of the release into the
   environment are discussed. Recent developments in the contamination of
   animal feeds in Europe, which have been widely spread throughout the
   food distribution system, act to highlight the unfortunate consequences
   that can arise from using the food chain as a sink for industrial waste.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the Toki, or Japanese Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon are
   now reduced to a single female in Japan, and captive and free-living
   populations of about 80 individuals in Yang Xian, Shaanxi Province and
   the Beijing Zoo, People's Republic of China. Very little has been
   published about the biology of this species except for Japanese journals
   and popular articles. Here we outline some unique aspects of the
   breeding biology of this species as well as introduce endocrine methods
   as a way of determining the source of reproductive problems in captive
   breeding programmes and, tentatively, how hormone manipulations based on
   these observations may help to enhance reproductive output. The Toki has
   a unique nuptial plumage that is acquired by the cosmetic application of
   a black tar-like substance secreted by a well-defined patch of skin in
   the throat and neck region. Apparent specialized down feathers develop
   in this region during a localized moult in November. The tar-like
   substance is secreted in January and February and is applied to the
   head, neck and upper torso by a combination of bathing and daubing
   behaviour. Development of nuptial colour is thus a combination of
   morphological development, secretion and a unique behaviour. This
   combination is found only in adults. Single plasma samples collected
   from captive Toki at known times in the breeding cycle suggest normal
   hormone patterns in some individuals, and abnormal levels in those that
   fail to breed. These conclusions are strengthened by endocrine
   investigations of a non-endangered ibis species, Threskiornis
   melanocephalus, that reveal normal patterns of circulating
   concentrations of gonadotrophins and sex steroids as expected for a
   seasonally breeding bird. Measurement of faecal hormone levels may be a
   less invasive way of monitoring reproductive function in critically
   endangered species. Recent work on Japanese Quail Coturnix japonica
   shows that hormone therapy using purified avian gonadotrophins in
   non-reproductive individuals results in gonadal maturation, egg-laying
   and production of reproductively active offspring. Although these
   techniques are still in their formative stages, results to date strongly
   suggest that carefully applied endocrine techniques can indicate
   potential problems in captive breeding programmes and may be useful for
   hormone therapy in critically endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{A marked population of Sedge Warblers Acrocephalus schoenobaenus was
   studied from 1993-95, the reproductive success of pairs was monitored
   and blood samples collected for DNA profiling. Measures of male physical
   and behavioural traits were also made, including song repertoire size,
   the amount of time spent singing and song-flighting, as well as
   territory quality. Although the Sedge Warbler is generally considered to
   be monogamous, social polygyny occurred in both 1994 and 1995, giving an
   overall rate for the two years of 7.7\% of males. The overall rate of
   extra-pair paternity in the population was found to be 8.4\% of
   offspring, with 34.4\% of broods containing one or more extra-pair
   young. No incidences of intra-specific brood parasitism (egg dumping)
   were identified. Cuckolded males were compared with other males, but no
   significant differences were identified for any of the physical,
   behavioural or territorial measures. In particular, there was no
   evidence that previously detected mate choice cues are related to
   patterns of paternity within the population, and hence no evidence that
   such cues indicate genetic benefits to females. It therefore seems
   likely that repertoire size reflects male phenotypic quality in this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{A new method employing palm oil as bait was developed for studying the
   distribution and ecology of subterranean army ants. In SE Asia the
   hypogaeic army ant Dorylus laevigatus was found to be very common in
   both forested and open environments. More than 10 000 workers were found
   at individual baits. The workers cooperatively dig a three-dimensional
   tunnel network into the soil. Over a period of 72 days no emigrations of
   D, laevigatus could be detected, a first indication of a facultatively
   stationary way of life in this ant. Encounters with Pheidologeton
   silenus about food resources were observed. In feeding experiments D.
   laevigatus readily took a variety of arthropods and annelids but ignored
   starch containing vegetables as food. The rare hypogaeic D. (Alaopone)
   cf. vishnui could be collected for the first time in India and Sri
   Lanka. Also the epigaeic D. (Anomma) nigricans from Africa were found to
   be attracted to palm oil. The oil-method thus provides the opportunity
   to detect and monitor populations of army ants of the genus Dorylus in
   tropical and subtropical habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Effective monitoring of microbial populations in environmental samples
   requires highly sensitive analytical methods. Studies of microbial
   communities using traditional techniques are incomplete because of their
   inherent inability to identify and quantify all types of contributing
   populations. In this chapter we have used molecular genetic approaches
   to compare the responses of microbial communities to organic and
   conventional management practices. Soil DNA was isolated by the direct
   lysis method and subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
   analysis. Soil DNA yields ranged frsm2.44 to 4.56 mu g/L in conventional
   and 4.08 to 6.76 mu g/g in organic samples. RAPD patterns generated were
   characteristic for organic and conventional soil types. Although some
   intermediate banding patterns were observed between the two soil types,
   major bands were distinguishable. The number of RAPD bands varied in
   both organic and conventional soil samples collected at 15-d intervals
   from April to July, which may indicate shifts in microbial populations.
   Thus, the RAPD technique has potential to detect changes in microbial
   population. However, the method requires processing of large number of
   replicate soil samples to generate reproducible polymorphic patterns.}},

Abstract = {{In KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) 56.5\% of the population is rural and
   61\% have inadequate sanitation infrastructure or water supply. The
   remaining inhabitants are served by a reticulated water and sewage
   infrastructure with modem purification processes and monitoring,
   effectively eliminating water-borne infection and disease. Those using
   rivers, springs, dams or boreholes for ablutions and drinking water are
   exposed to a wide range of pathogens. The health service provision to
   treat diarrhoeal disease alone costs the province approximately 2\% of
   its GDP. Endemic diseases are caused by enteropathic Escherichia coli,
   Salmonella typhi, Shigella, hepatitis A, rota-viruses, amoeba (amoebic
   dysentery), Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Bilharzia (a major risk to
   people using low-lying water bodies for recreation) and internal
   parasites (e.g. Ascaris) occur while a cholera outbreak is anticipated
   from Mozambique. Education programmes are being employed to inform
   people of water sanitation methods while raw and treated drinking water
   is monitored for pathogens, often using indicator organisms. A formal
   Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases Programme is being developed to address
   these problems in an integrated and co-ordinated manner. The reticulated
   water supply and sewage networks are constantly expanding and services
   are being expanded to service outlying communities.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript presents some results of a monitoring of the planktonic
   communities of Lago Maggiore during the complete overturn of the lake in
   the winter of 1998/1999.
   These results are of particular interest not only because holomixy is a
   rare event in this well-known water body, but also because these are the
   first such results obtained after a significant change in the lake's
   trophic status.
   Holomixy can be regarded as a ``whole lake experiment{''} sensu
   EDMONDSON (1993): irrespective of the mechanisms underlying the process,
   it produces an internal enrichment of algal nutrients, and particularly
   of phosphorus.
   The increase in biomass and productivity of phytoplankton seems to be
   driven more by the increase in phosphorus than by a decrease in
   potential grazers. However, once the luxury amount of nutrients supplied
   by the overturn was exhausted, the photosynthetic productivity decreased
   to values more typical of a ``normal{''} spring productivity, in
   accordance with the present trophic condition of the lake. Similarly,
   the enhancement of phytoplankton growth seems likely to have stimulated
   the numerical increase of zooplankton, and especially of small, fast
   reproducing rotifer species.
   Moreover, the spring pulse of primary productivity and the phosphorus
   enrichment represent a crucial phase for the storage of the potential
   energy necessary for the development of the zooplankton population,
   particularly of cladocera, in summer.}},

Abstract = {{One component of the Gulf of Mexico Offshore Operations Monitoring
   Experiment (GOOMEX) was to assess the reproductive effort and health
   (defined as the prevalence and intensity of parasites or pathologies) of
   mobile macroepifauna collected near-to and far-from gas-producing
   platforms. The stage of reproductive development as determined by visual
   inspection or histological analysis was rarely significantly different
   between near-field and far-field sites. Tissues were examined
   histologically to determine the prevalence and intensity of parasitism
   and disease. If a difference in parasitism or pathology existed.
   individuals collected far-from the platforms typically had higher
   prevalences while individuals living near-to the platforms usually had
   higher intensities. Parasitism and disease had little effect on stage of
   reproductive development except at MU-A85 where individuals with
   increased disease and parasitism also had decreased reproductive
   development. Variations in infection intensity were not due to
   differences in age structure of populations. Larger, older individuals
   were not consistently more heavily parasitized.
   Trend in reproductive stage and population health did not follow trends
   in environmental contamination; the fewest significant differences were
   observed at the most contaminated platforms. Patterns of differences in
   parasitism, disease and reproductive effort between the near and
   far-field stations were platform specific, indicating that the physical
   and chemical characteristics unique to each platform probably control
   reproductive effort and levels of disease and parasitism in populations
   living there. The influence of structure, a variable common to all
   platforms, did not exert an overriding influence. Mobile taxa such as
   shrimp exhibited near-field/far-field differences as frequently as the
   less mobile species such as starfish. Thus, mobile epifauna maintain
   discrete populations over long-enough time periods to develop different
   population histories. Shallow-water sites were more likely to exhibit
   platform-specific near-field/far-field differences in population
   structure suggesting that trends in water depth and the intensity of
   seasonality may explain the apparent uniqueness of each platform's
   effect on population structure and health.}},

   small units or colonies separated by unoccupied areas, where South polar
   skua (Catharacta maccormicki) nest. Colony layout, breeding chronology,
   breeding success, diet, and foraging areas were studied for five
   consecutive austral summers. Satellite transmitters, time-depth
   recorders, and electronic tagging were used for monitoring feeding
   behaviour and nest attendance. An Automated Penguin Monitoring System
   was installed which records weight, identity, and direction of penguins
   as they move between the sea and their breeding colony. So far, the
   results of this study are documentation on colony trends, breeding
   biology, and differences in foraging strategies at different study

Title = {{Long-term observations on the dynamics of three species of polychaetes
   living on tidal flats of the Wadden Sea: the role of weather and
   predator-prey interactions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-44}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. On the tidal flats of the Wadden Sea, the predatory polychaete
   Nephtys hombergii (Sav.) is sensitive to low winter temperatures,
   whereas its main prey, the smaller polychaetes Scoloplos armiger
   (O.F.M.) and Heteromastus filiformis (Clap.) are not.
   2. Monitoring macrofauna dynamics during the last three decades
   (1970-97) in two distant Wadden Sea areas revealed that Nephtys
   abundance was severely reduced in all eight coldest winters (generally
   to an average of < 0.1 g ash-free dry weight m(-2)), whereas its biomass
   reached mean values around 1 g AFDW m(-2) during periods with mild
   winters (less than or equal to 5 days with an air temperature remaining
   below 0 degrees C all day). Over-winter changes in Nephtys abundance
   were strongly related to temperature and 70\% of the variability in late
   winter abundance of this species could be explained by temperature
   characteristics of the foregoing winter.
   3. Biomass values of Nephtys observed in late winter predicted to a high
   degree (90\%) the generally somewhat higher values in the subsequent
   summer. This seasonal change of predator abundance was generally not
   related to prey density. Only locally (in an exposed low-biomass area)
   and rarely (one-tenth of the years of observation) did low prey supply
   (if it was lower than simultaneous predator biomass) coincide with a
   decline, rather than the usual seasonal increase in Nephtys biomass.
   4. A negative influence of predator abundance on prey biomass was
   observed in both prey species over the entire range of observed predator
   biomass values. The usual seasonal (winter to summer) increase of prey
   biomass was significantly smaller at high than at low Nephtys biomass
   and was even reduced to nil at the highest predator density observed.
   Scoloplos biomass was about four times higher after years with low (<
   0.1 g m(-2)) than after years with high (> 1.0 g m(-2)) Nephtys biomass.
   Similar differences were observed in biomass of Heteromastus.
   5. It is concluded that winter temperatures act as an important
   structuring factor in the Wadden Sea zoobenthic community by directly
   governing the densities of an important infaunal predator and indirectly
   affecting the abundance of at least two important prey species. Cold
   winters intervene by starting a new cycle of predator-prey interaction
   on average once per 3 or 4 years.
   6. Predator abundance was more frequently determined by weather
   conditions than by food supply. Prey abundance was primarily governed by
   predator abundance and food supply and was only indirectly (via predator
   abundance) affected by the incidence of cold winters.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 768,500 triploid grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella
   Valenciennes) were stocked into the Santee Cooper reservoirs, South
   Carolina between 1989 and 1996 to control hydrilla (Hydrilla
   verticillata (L.f.) Royle). Hydrilla coverage was reduced from a high of
   17,272 ha during 1994 to a few ha by 1998. During 1997, 1998 and 1999,
   at least 98 triploid grass carp were collected yearly for population
   monitoring. Estimates of age, growth, and mortality as well as
   population models, were used in the study to monitor triploid grass carp
   and predict population trends. Condition declined from that measured
   during a previous study in 1994. The annual mortality rate was estimated
   at 28\% in 1997, 32\% in 1998 and 39\% in 1999; however, only the 1999
   mortality rate was significantly different. Few (2 out of 98) of the
   triploid grass carp collected during 1999 were older than age 9. We
   expect increased mortality due to an aging population and sparse
   hydrilla coverage. During 1999, we estimated about 63,000 triploid grass
   carp system wide and project less than 3,000 fish by 2004, assuming no
   future stocking.}},

Abstract = {{Pheromone-baited traps are frequently used for research or in monitoring
   populations of bark beetles such as the southern pine beetle,
   Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann, and Ips spp, which are important
   pests of southern pines. We compared the effectiveness of two
   commercially available trap designs, the multiple-funnel trap and the
   slot trap, for collection of D. frontalis, three species of Ips, and two
   of their common predators. Slot traps captured greater numbers of bark
   beetles while multiple-funnel traps captured more predators.
   Multiple-funnel traps were judged to be easier to transport and check in
   the field. This study indicates that slot traps are preferable for
   monitoring southern bark beetles with the least disruption to natural
   enemy populations, while multiple-funnel traps are better for monitoring
   bark beetle/predator ratios. Due to ease of checking and handling,
   multiple-funnel traps are preferable for uses that involve large numbers
   of traps, long-distance manual hauling, or frequent relocation of traps.}},

Abstract = {{In order to clarify the local variation in exposure and source-receptor
   relationships, a dispersion model for estimating air pollution
   concentrations was developed for a polluted area in the Czech Republic.
   Three models characterized by different spatial resolution were
   integrated into one modelling tool. A regional-scale dispersion model
   accounted for pollution contribution from sources outside the modelling
   area. Local- and urban-scale dispersion models were used to calculate
   local concentration distributions.
   Calculated concentration distributions were evaluated. Deviations
   between observed and calculated concentrations were not correlated in
   space, except in episodes, and concentrations measured at spatially
   representative stations were assimilated into the model results using
   statistical interpolation (simple kriging).
   The results indicated that centralized heating plants and local home
   heating were the most important sources for sulfur dioxide (SO2)
   pollution. Both high and low level sources may contribute to the
   accumulation of pollution concentrations in episodes. The measured
   concentrations were important for the description of distributions in
   episodes characterized by complex wind and dispersion conditions. The
   applicability of source oriented model calculations to correctly
   represent measured concentrations in the pollution episodes was limited
   due to the fact that meteorological conditions representative of high
   concentration episodes were characterized by very low wind speed and
   variable wind directions.
   About 8000 individuals were given an exposure estimate representing
   contribution from local emissions, based on the estimated hourly outdoor
   exposure to SO2 at their home/work addresses in the 3 month study period
   in the autumn of 1991. The results showed that, for 5\% of participants,
   the maximum hourly contribution of local emissions was over 380 mu g
   m(-3). For the 3 month average, both large-scale and local-scale
   pollution contribute significantly. For primary compounds, such as SO2,
   steep gradients are observed in the vicinity of strong local sources.
   These gradients are important for exposure characteristics and health
   effect quantification, and often will not be captured by an existing
   monitoring network. The calculations can be extended to other periods or
   to different compounds.}},

   Two types of survey were undertaken: broad scale, to determine wide

   to establish ranges of effect from recognised input points. This
   evaluation indicates that results from the broad scale surveys can be
   used to compare different areas of coastline. Nucella is widespread away

   imposex. Populations are generally not at risk. The localised surveys
   indicate that, in certain situations, the monitoring objectives can be

Abstract = {{The equivalent biological half-times, T-e, of Cs-137 and K-40 in a
   South-Swedish urban population have been determined through whole-body
   measurements and urinary excretion analysis. The T-e - values for Cs-137
   found in males were on average, significantly lower than what is given
   in the literature. The relatively low average whole-body content of
   K-40, Q(K), the males could explain the discrepancy, taking into
   consideration that a positive correlation between the T-e and Q(K) has
   been suggested in an earlier work. Furthermore, the potassium-normalized
   caesium urinary excretion was determined for the subjects in the study,
   and values were found to be in accordance with earlier results. A
   literature study of previous experimental data on the
   potassium-normalized caesium excretion however raises some questions
   about its applicability as a method for estimating the whole-body burden

   describe the changes in gonadal development and plasma steroid levels in
   a relatively late maturing species,the striped bass, during the first
   four years of life. In about 65\% of the females, puberty was initiated
   during the third year. Although gonadosomatic index (GSI) and oocyte
   diameter increased during this year, this first cycle was characterized
   by a heterogeneous population of developing oocytes, a relatively low
   mean maximum oocyte diameter, and an absence of yolk granules in the
   oocytes. Plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) levels were low in all
   three-year-old fish, suggesting that an insufficient stimulation of
   vitellogenin production by E(2) may underlie the lack of vitellogenin
   incorporation into developing oocytes. All monitored parameters
   increased during the fourth year, but were still below the values
   attained by older females. In about 60\% of the males, puberty was
   initiated during the first year and all males were mature by the third
   year. During the first two years, several immature males initiated
   spermatogenesis without reaching full maturity. In mature males, mean
   GSI, plasma testosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone levels increased
   simultaneously, reaching higher values each subsequent year. Our results
   indicate that, similar to the situation in mammals, more than one
   reproductive cycle is required in striped bass before complete adulthood
   is reached. J. Exp. Zool. 286:49-63, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc..}},

Abstract = {{Residence location has long been used to indicate environmental exposure
   in many epidemiological studies. This indicator is easy to establish,
   requires little exposure or monitoring data, and is potentially
   applicable to many types of investigations. The validity, accuracy and
   utility of residence location as an exposure indicator, however, is
   challenged by current concerns regarding multiple exposure pathways,
   persistent and toxic contaminants, and cumulative exposures from
   non-point, mobile and point sources. This paper reviews 45
   epidemiological studies that use residence location to identify study
   populations and estimate air pollution exposures. Thirteen (29\%) of the
   studies determined environmental exposures based on ``proximity{''}
   measures, usually the distance from a subject's residence to a pollutant
   source. Other studies used ``zones{''} presumed to have equal pollutant
   levels. Several studies combined zone and proximity approaches.
   Exposures were quantified using monitoring data in 27 (60\%) studies and
   dispersion modeling in two (4\%) studies. Sixteen (36\%) studies did not
   use any environmental data to quantify exposure. A total of 31 (69\%) of
   the studies reported significant associations between health endpoints
   and the pollutant exposures represented by residence location. In
   general, comprehensive and systematic approaches to identify and
   estimate population exposures were not used, and the exposure estimates
   were therefore deemed likely to have great uncertainty. Unless exposure
   levels among groups are verified, it cannot be determined whether
   nonsignificant associations between exposures and health endpoints
   indicate a lack of measurable health effects, or are merely a result of
   exposure misclassification. Site-specific and quantitative exposure
   assessments are needed to better quantify and confirm exposures within
   such studies, as well as to permit interpretations and comparisons
   across studies.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and life history characteristics of Mysis relicta were
   evaluated at an offshore (110-m) and a nearshore (40 to 45-m) station
   during 1995, 1996, and 1998. Data were collected ro monitor mysids
   relative to ongoing ecological changes in Lake Michigan and as a
   comparison to studies from the 1970s and 1980s. Mean densities of M.
   relicta during May through September each year were higher offshore
   (210/m(2) to 373/m(2)) compared to nearshore (41/m(2) to 168/m(2)).
   Growth rates ranged between 0.026 to 0.041 mm/day and did not differ
   between stations or with age. Juvenile mysids (< 10 mm) dominated the
   population, and accounted for 30 to 90\% of the catch. The size
   distribution of M. relicta suggested that reproduction occurred
   year-round with the most consistent influxes of juveniles in the spring
   (April through June) each year; winter (February and March) and summer
   (July through September) influxes of juveniles did nor occur
   consistently each year. Mean length of females with broods differed
   between nearshore (14 mm) and offshore (16 mm). Brood size and the
   proportion of females with broods did not differ between stations.
   Abundance estimates were equal or higher and life history
   characteristics were similar to reported data from the 1970s and 1980s.
   However ongoing declines in the benthic macroinvertebrate Diporeia may
   result in higher fish predation pressure on M. relicta in the near
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Loss and alteration of breeding habitat have been proposed as causes of
   declines in several Neotropical migrant bird populations. We conducted a
   4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and
   forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina)
   populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia.
   We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent
   annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry: and mist
   netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25);
   wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked
   male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly
   survival was 0.981 +/- 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 +/-
   0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579
   (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or
   juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult
   survival. Annual population growth (lambda) at PNWR was 1.00 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable
   uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term
   monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth
   increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95\% CI
   before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment lambda
   declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found. no evidence
   that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve
   red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively affected
   wood thrushes.}},

Abstract = {{The Pacific coast population of western snowy plovers (Charadrius
   alexandrinus nivosus) was listed as threatened under the Endangered
   Species Act (ESA) in 1993 and its decline is primarily attributed. to
   habitat loss. In southern California, snowy plovers typically nest in
   association with federally endangered. California least tel ns (Sterna
   antillarum browni). Since least terns were afforded protection under the
   ESA, the creation of nesting habitat from dredged materials has been a
   popular component of habitat restoration to partially compensate for
   wetland loss in this region. We had a unique opportunity to monitor
   habitat use and reproductive success at newly created habitats
   associated with the restoration of Batiquitos Lagoon, San Diego County,
   California from 1994 to 1998. We also compared hatch and fledge rates
   and habitat characteristics of snowy plovers nesting at new nesting
   areas at Batiquitos Lagoon to a nearby natural bench;Ind a dredged
   material area created in the 1970s. The number of nesting attempts Ly
   snowy plovers increased from 5 in 1994 to a high of 38 in 1997, and
   plovers nested on 4 of die 5 created areas. Fledge rates at Batiquitos
   Lagoon varied annually and declined after the initial colonization in
   1995. Fledge rate in 1995 was higher at the newly created area than at
   the older dredged-material and natural beach areas in any other year.
   Nests on the created areas at Batiquitos Lagoon were surrounded by less
   vegetative cover, less debris, and shorter vegetation than nests at the
   older dredged-material and natural beach areas. Nonbreeding snowy
   plovers used created habitats within the lagoon, and more plovers used
   the lagoon and its adjacent beach during fall than winter . Predation
   pressure and habitat quality were important factors determining use and
   reproductive success on created areas at Batiquitos Lagoon.}},

Abstract = {{Control of feral horse populations (Equus caballus) on public lands is
   restricted to nonlethal methods. These methods can limit population
   growth; however, efficacy may vary among populations with differing
   demography and social structures. Characteristics of many western feral
   horse populations are well documented, but fewer data are available for
   Atlantic barrier island populations. Therefore, we monitored a
   population of feral horses on Cumberland Island, Georgia from 1986 to
   1990. Population growth averaged 4.3\% annually with a stable age
   structure. Mean size of bands with greater than or equal to 1 stallion
   was 4.6 horses. The adult sex ratio for the population was 0.6 females:
   1.0 males. About 66\% of mares fouled during a given >enr and no
   juvenile females foaled. Annual survival rates averaged 61.1\% fur
   female foals, 58.8\% for male foals, and 92.4\% for mares. Most bands
   contained a dominant or codominant stallion, mares and-or juvenile
   females, and. foals. Most mares (62.5\%) changed, bands greater than or
   equal to 1 time during; our study Bachelors represented 50.4\% of
   stallions. These population characteristics differed from other feral
   horse populations. The small Land size, large number of bachelors, high
   degree of band instability and codominance of Land stallions on
   Cumberland Island likely will limit the efficacy of some forms of
   nonlethal population control.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored survival of 397 radiomarked juvenile American black ducks
   (Anas rubripes) distributed among Les Escoumins (n = 75) and Kamouraska,
   Quebec (n = 84), Amherst Point, Nova Scotia (n = 89), and a site on the
   Vermont-Quebec border (n = 149) during autumn 1990 and 1991. Eighty-six
   percent (215 of 250) of all confirmed mortalities during the study was
   from hunting; 72\% of marked ducks were shot and retrieved and 14\% were
   shot and. unretrieved. We tested for differences in survival in relation
   to sex, body mass, year (1990-91, 1991-92), and among the 4 locations
   for each of 2 monitoring periods (early: EMP; late, LMP). With data from
   the EMP for Vermont-Quebec in 1990 and 1991, Les Escoumins in 1990, and.
   Amherst Point in 1991, survival of hatching-year (HY) males and females
   did not differ (P = 0.357). For sexes combined. for the EMP, survival of
   clucks was greater in 1991 than 1900 (P = 0.086), and differed among
   locations (P = 0.013). Survival (years combined) was greater at Amherst
   Point than at Kamouraska (P = 0.003) and Vermont-Quebec (P = 0.002)
   during the EMP. The highest survival rate at Amherst Point (0.545 +/-
   0.056 {[}SE]) was associated with the latest date (8 Oct) of season
   opening; the lowest survival rate (0.385 +/- 0.043) was at the
   Vermont-Quebec border, where hunter numbers and, activity were greatest.
   For the LMP no interaction between years and locations was detected (P =
   0.942), and no differences in survival existed between years (P = 0.102)
   and among locations (P = 0.349). No association was detected between
   body mass at capture and survival of combined males and females during
   the EMP (P = 0.572) or during the EMP (P = 0.572) or during we censored
   hunting losses for combined years for each period, EMP or LMP all
   survival estimates exceeded 0.800 (0.809-0.985). These data emphasize
   need for an improved harvest strategy for American black ducks in North
   America to allow for increases in breeding populations to achieve
   population goals.}},

Abstract = {{There are few quick, precise indices for predicting population size of
   semifossorial mammals. We assessed thr utility of powder-tracking and
   infrared thermal imaging to predict population size in the Arctic ground
   squirrel (Spermophilus parryii) in the boreal forest of southwestern
   Yukon. Density estimated from livetrapping was strongly and linearly
   correlated with both indices (r = 0.81 for powder-tracking; r = 0.91 for
   infrared imaging). The slope of the relationship between density and the
   infrared index (0.10) deviated. from a slope of 1. The slope of the
   relationship between density and the powder-tracking index (0.82) did,
   not deviate from a slope of 1, but our power to detect departures from
   this slope using this index was low (0.10). We recommend infrared
   imaging and powder-tracking for monitoring population sizes of
   semifossorial mammals.}},

Abstract = {{At present most Siberian rivers can't be used as drinking mater sources.
   Because of environment worsening the surface water became undrinkable,
   So, about 98 \% of Tomsk region population use ground mater sources.
   Nevertheless Tomsk region water-hearing levels don't comply with
   requirements of drinking water state standards.
   In small villages of Tomsk region where is no centralized water supply
   the water is drawed from water wells. Ground water is used without any
   water treatment. Whereas in most of water wells the content of iron,
   manganese and hardness of water exceeds the admissible level several
   times.
   The main goal of this research work was the estimation of ground water
   chemical content and suitability for drinking water supply. We have
   researched drinking water sources of Tomsk region villages: Loskutovo,
   Timiryazevo and others.
   The analytical methods applied are: colorimetry, flame photometry and
   complexation titration. Experimental results show the iron excess
   concentration in every ater sample. In conclusion it should be noted
   that ground water of Tomsk region is suitable for drinking water supply.
   But we should recommend to use water purifiers in household or built
   deironing stations to decrease the iron concentration in ground water.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of low ambient temperature and of social factors on the
   physiological condition of subadult European wild rabbits (Oryctolagus
   cuniculus L.) during the winter season were studied in a population
   living under semi-natural conditions. Total serum protein, serum
   concentration of beta -hydroxybutyrate and body mass were monitored
   monthly and percentage of glycated haemoglobin was determined once in
   late winter. Social integration of subadults was assessed by direct
   observations. A close relationship between fluctuations of ambient
   temperature, serum protein levels and body mass was found. The results
   indicate that protein reserves rather than body lipids but were the
   important energy resource of subadult rabbits during the winter season.
   Negative effects on physiological parameters were closely related to
   higher mortality rates and to a shortened survival time respectively.
   The percentage of glycated haemoglobin and levels of serum protein were
   correlated with the degree of social integration whereas the relation to
   serum protein was only apparent in dispersers. I hypothesize that the
   negative physiological effects of the cold on subadults can be reduced
   either by mechanisms of social support and/or by thermoregulatory
   benefit.}},

Abstract = {{The threat of rabies has led to a large number of studies on fox
   populations. However, only a few long-term fox abundance monitoring
   studies have been carried out. The available data in Europe (e.g.
   hunting statistics, night counts, track and pellet counts) suggest that
   foxes have increased in abundance in several European regions. We
   investigate several possible reasons for this increase in abundance. The
   eradication of rabies and human-caused changes in the demographic
   parameters (for survival and/or productivity) of foxes seem to have had
   the most significant effect. Local fox population densities may be very
   high and this may represent a significant hazard for the transmission of
   rabies or other zoonoses to humans.}},

Abstract = {{The Australian freshwater mussel Hyridella depressa sequesters elements
   in calcium phosphate (CaP) granules that form extensive aggregations in
   its tissues. Elements contained in these granules were determined by
   X-ray microanalysis of river and lake mussels from the Hawkesbury-Nepean
   River system, New South Wales. Granules in freeze-substituted mantle
   tissue were analysed to determine the variation in element profiles in
   granules among mussels and among sites. For the common elements Ca, P,
   Fe, Mg and Mn, granule composition reflected catchment lithology and
   site trophic status and indicated exogenous input. These were most
   important for differentiation among lake sites and also indicated
   differences between lake and river mussels. Site differences seen with
   some common elements in granules from lake mussels correlated with
   differences in water chemistry. Trace elements, particularly Al, Cu, Zn
   and Pb, were also important in lake and river site differentiation. The
   granules play a major role in element dynamics in freshwater mussel
   tissues and provide a focal structure for direct analysis of element
   accumulation by these bivalves. The results indicate that
   characterization of element content of granules in mussel populations
   would provide valuable insights into animal-element interactions in
   freshwater systems for ecological and ecotoxicological investigations.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term effects of the 1988 algal bloom (Chrysochromulina
   polylepis Manton et Parke) along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast are
   evaluated and discussed on the basis of several monitoring programmes.
   Effects on individual growth and survival of coastal cod and its
   population dynamics are analysed. Cod suffered a high mortality from
   June until November, and the 1988 year-class was strongly reduced.
   Growth was only slightly affected. Furthermore, the effects at the
   community level are evaluated for the coastal fish community and the
   benthic communities. These communities were strongly affected on a short
   time scale, but recovered surprisingly fast. Populations of most
   organisms had recovered within months, and after 1 yr few traces of the
   toxic bloom could be observed; after 4 to 5 yr all communities had
   essentially recovered. As part of the review we also discuss to what
   extent harmful blooms are Likely to reoccur, and conclude that blooms
   have reoccurred and will continue to do so. However, nothing can be
   concluded about the toxicity of such blooms. We expect that even large
   perturbations are unlikely to leave any profound long-lasting effects.
   The effects of the 1988 bloom are discussed within a theoretical
   framework including stability, resilience and inertia. In conclusion we
   emphasise the importance of long-term monitoring data; without such data
   the analyses reported in this paper would have been impossible.}},

Abstract = {{The Baltic is a young, brackish and non-tidal sea, supporting an
   impoverished marine flora compared with adjacent open coastal areas.
   Populations of the normally intertidal brown alga Fucus vesiculosus L.
   are permanently submerged in the Baltic. We tested the hypothesis that
   these populations have evolved a reduced ability to withstand
   water-stresses caused by aerial exposure (desiccation and freezing),
   relative to adjacent intertidal populations in the North Sea.
   Desiccation and freezing tolerance were compared using chlorophyll
   fluorescence to monitor photosynthetic status during stress and
   recovery. To control for the influence of growth salinity on stress
   tolerance, the experimental material consisted of either adult algae
   cross-acclimated at Baltic and North Sea salinities (6.5 and 20 to 24
   practical salinity units {[}psu], respectively), or juveniles from both
   populations grown in the Baltic from embryos (submersed, 6.5 psu).
   Baltic algae were less able to recover maximum photochemical yield
   (F-v/F-m) after freezing at -15 degrees C than North Sea algae, and
   neither acclimation (adults) or growth salinity (juveniles) accounted
   for between-population differences. During desiccation at 5 degrees C,
   differences in the response of variable fluorescence (F-v), as well as
   in initial fluorescence (F-0) and F-v during recovery, indicated that
   impaired photoprotective processes may contribute to the inability of
   Baltic algae to fully recover F-v/F-m after stress, in contrast to North
   Sea algae which displayed dynamic and rapidly recoverable reductions of
   F-v/F-m. Subsequent desiccation experiments during the summer (at 25
   degrees C) showed that, relative to North Sea algae, the effective
   photochemical yield (Delta F/F-m') of Baltic algae started to decline at
   lower tissue-water content (TWC) and recovered less completely after a
   return to seawater. A critical TWC of ca 10\% for Baltic populations was
   identified, below which Delta F/F-m' did not fully recover. In addition,
   Baltic algae were less able to regain initial TWC during recovery. These
   results indicate that, in ca 7500 yr since the recruitment of the
   present marine flora to the Baltic, F. vesiculosus has evolved reduced
   tolerance to emersion stresses compared to adjacent intertidal
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The prosobranchs Nucella lapillus, Nassarius reficulatus, Hydrobia ulvae
   and Littorina littorea were sampled from May to July 1998 at 45 stations
   in the Ria de Aveiro (NW Portugal) and the adjacent coastal zone. The
   distribution patterns of these populations were related to the salinity
   gradients. The tributyltin (TBT) concentration in the water was
   determined for 17 stations spread over the study area during a neap tide
   in July 1998 and varied from 9 to 42 ng Sn l(-1). The TBT contamination
   of unsieved sediments taken from 20 sites inside the Ria de Aveiro in
   July 1998 ranged from <6 to 88 ng Sn g(-1) dry weight. All populations
   of the 4 species showed imposer (superimposition of male characters on
   females) or the related phenomenon intersex, except for N. reticulatus
   at some inshore stations outside the ria. The vas deferens sequence
   index (VDSI) of N. reticulatus, H. ulvae and N. lapillus varied from
   0.0-4.8, 0.2-1.1 and 4.0-4.4, respectively. The intersex index (IST) for
   L. littorea ranged from 0.3 to 0.5. Sterilization of females was found
   in N. lapillus at 1 site (29 \%). This muricid was the most sensitive
   species to TBT, followed, in decreasing order, by N. reticulatus, H.
   ulvae and L. littorea. The nassariid N. reticulatus provided the best
   discrimination between stations with different TBT environmental
   contamination. his proposed that N. reticulatus and H. ulvae may jointly
   be used for monitoring sediments of moderately to highly contaminated
   estuarine systems due to their complementary distributions with regard
   to salinity, their common type of substrate and their ubiquity on the
   European coast.}},

Title = {{Mass recruitment of Ophiothrix fragilis (Ophiuroidea) on sponges:
   settlement patterns and post-settlement dynamics}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{201-212}},
Abstract = {{The main recruitment of Ophiothrix fragilis occurs in the northwestern
   Mediterranean in late spring-early summer. Recruits are whitish and
   aggregate visibly on the surfaces of some sponge species, where they can
   reach densities above 50 ind.cm(2), In order to investigate this
   association, we monitored larval abundances in the plankton, and recruit
   distribution and dynamics on the benthos. Settlement took place in
   several batches, with peak abundance of recruits on sponges in June. The
   mean diameter of juveniles was 0.2 mm in June and grew to 0.4 mm in
   September. In July, after the settlement ceased, juveniles were more
   abundant on the surfaces of the sponges Crambe crambe, Scopalina
   lophyropoda and Dysidea avara (14 to 20 ind, cm(-2)) than on the
   adjacent algal turf (4 ind, cm(-2)). No preference could be
   substantiated for 6 other encrusting sponge species. In contrast,
   juveniles were not significantly more abundant on these 3 sponges in
   June while settlement was under way. Recruitment on experimental sponges
   covered with plastic lids was reduced by two-thirds, indicating an
   initial colonization directly from the water column. However, clearing
   experiments demonstrated the ability of the young brittle stars to
   recolonise sponges, and brittle stars were more abundant at the
   periphery than at the centre of the sponges. These results indicate that
   brittle star recruits can select their substrata, possibly as a result
   of post-settlement lateral migration, resulting in an uneven
   distribution among sponge species. We set forth the hypothesis that this
   association between brittle stars and sponges is based on a trophic
   relationship, small brittle stars taking advantage of the inhalant
   currents of the sponge. In sponges with well-defined inhalant fields,
   almost all recruits concentrate on them, with arms flat against the
   sponge. When the brittle stars grow to a size above 1 mm (disk diameter)
   they abandon sponge surfaces and hide in small crevices between algae
   and invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal changes in the distribution of the serpulid polychaete Ditrupa
   arietina in the Bay of Banyuls-sur-mer were monitored between January
   1996 and January 1998. Life-history characteristics, population
   dynamics, secondary production and calcification were measured at a
   permanent site between June 1994 and June 1996. Secondary production and
   calcification were then extrapolated to the whole Bay. D, anietina has a
   2 yr life cycle with worms first reproducing when they are 1 yr old.
   Reproduction occurs during spring with several spawning peaks each year.
   Development is planktotrophic and the duration of the pelagic phase is
   close to 6 wk. Recruitment does not correlate with larval supply due to
   high mortality rates during the first benthic stage. Mortality follows
   an exponential model. Growth is best described by a logistic model and
   is almost restricted to the first year of the life cycle. Density
   significantly decreased between 1996 and 1998. This pattern resulted
   from a strong recruitment in the whole bay during 1994, a weaker
   recruitment restricted to the deeper part of the bay during 1995, and a
   total absence of recruitment during both 1996 and 1997. Secondary
   production was between 0.4 and 295.9 g DW m(-2) yr(-1), and 0.1 and 12.3
   g DW m(-2) yr(-1), during the June 1994 to June 1995 and the June 1995
   to June 1996 time periods, respectively. Calcification was between 17
   and 11836 g m(-2) yr(-1), and 2 and 397 g m(-2) yr(-1), during the June
   1994 to June 1995 and the June 1995 to June 1996 time periods,
   respectively. Calcification rates calculated for the June 1994 to June
   1995 time period are the highest ever reported for temperate benthic
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Behavior of laboratory-reared larvae of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite
   was examined in Beaufort, North Carolina (USA), in relation to their
   physiological condition. Cyprid substratum exploration was monitored by
   means of video endoscopy using various experimental surface types
   (clean, biofilm, 1 and 2 wk fouled) and 2 water flow regimes (still
   water and ca 5 cm s(-1)) at room temperature (21 degrees C). We used the
   triacylglycerol/DNA (TAG/DNA) ratio of small batches of larvae as a
   measure of physiological condition in 0 to 12 d old cyprids. The
   physiological condition of cyprids decreased significantly with age (p <
   0.001), ratios severely dropping between 5 and 8 d. Although exploration
   behavior did not show much variation with age, the overall number of
   active exploring cyprids appeared to be age dependent. Additionally, the
   relationship between surface exploration behavior and age also appeared
   to vary with substratum type as well as flow rate. For example, fewer
   young cyprids (0 to 5 d old) explored unfavorable substrata (clean and
   biofilm treatments) than older ones in still water. Exploration
   responses, however, appeared to differ in relation to flow regimes
   (still vs moving water trials). Time spent by cyprids on surfaces before
   returning to the water column (non-exploratory behavior) appeared to
   vary in relation to age and substratum type in still water trials.
   Duration of exploration and distance explored by cyprids in flow
   generally peaked with cyprids from the 3 d cohort. Overall, our results
   showed that habitat selection in barnacle cyprids results from a complex
   relationship involving substratum type, hydrodynamics and larval age
   (i.e. physiological condition and competency).}},

Title = {{UVBR-induced DNA damage in natural marine picoplankton assemblages in
   the tropical Atlantic Ocean}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{UVBR (ultraviolet-B radiation: 280 to 315 nm)-induced DNA damage,
   measured as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), was determined in size
   fractions of natural populations of bacterio- and phytoplankton
   collected in marine tropical waters. Mean biologically effective UVBR
   doses in the wind-mixed layer were calculated from DNA dosimeter data.
   Phytoplankton species composition in these waters was monitored using
   flow cytometry and pigment analyses. In terms of (divinyl-)chlorophyll a
   concentrations, prochlorophytes and cyanobacteria comprised the largest
   fraction of the phytoplankton, except in a eutrophic bay at Curacao an
   island located in the southern Caribbean. In terms of cell numbers and
   amount of DNA, small prochlorophytes and marine bacteria dominated.
   Small but detectable levels of UVBR-induced DNA damage were found at all
   locations. In general, more DNA damage was found in the small size
   fraction (0.2 to 1 mu m) than in the larger size fraction (1 to 10 mu
   m). The greatest amount of damage was found in the small size fraction
   collected in the central Atlantic Ocean (20 CPDs/10(6) nucleotides),
   despite the fact that UVBR doses were much higher at other locations.
   The calculated mean biologically effective UVBR doses in the wind-mixed
   layer were 2 to 17 times lower as compared with incident UVBR doses. CPD
   levels determined in cultures of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp,
   subjected to UVBR doses similar to those in the wind-mixed layer
   corresponded with CPD levels measured in the 1 to 10 mu m fraction in
   the field. Our results indicate that UVBR vulnerability is size
   dependent. Furthermore, the low CPD levels observed in these field
   communities may be explained by the low mean biologically effective
   doses received by the cells as a result of wind-induced mixing.}},

Abstract = {{The biological impact of the grounding of the bulk carrier Iron Baron On
   Hebe Reef in northern Tasmania, with release of approximately 350 tonnes
   of Bunker C fuel oil, was assessed using quantitative underwater
   censuses at numerous reef sites before and after the spill. Physical
   abrasion from the ship's hull during grounding caused the complete
   destruction of the subtidal reef community within a localized area of
   approximate to 170 m by approximate to 20 m on Hebe Reef. However, the
   release of fuel oil did not appear to have substantially affected
   populations of subtidal reef-associated organisms in the near vicinity.
   Analyses of changes over time outside the hull impact area at oiled
   sites before and after the spill, and comparisons with undisturbed
   reference sites, indicated no significant change in number of species on
   reefs or in densities of the most abundant animal and plant species.
   Post-impact monitoring of the grounding zone and adjacent reference
   sites on Hebe Reef indicated that the fish assemblage associated with
   the hull scar recovered rapidly in terms of species composition and
   species richness within one year, whereas plant and invertebrate
   assemblages had not reached inferred pre-disturbance levels after two
   years. Wave disturbance appeared to be hindering re-establishment of
   large macroalgae over part of the abrasion zone where the reef substrata
   had been converted to unstable gravels, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{At the end of a mushroom cropping house trial designed to determine the
   infectivity, to phorid flies, of the entomopathogenic nematode
   Steinernema D1 (isolate IOW45), the spent, nematode-infested substrate
   was deposited as a stack on the edge of a field. The introduced
   population of Steinernema D1 (IOW45) was monitored by bi-monthly
   sampling for eight months. The infectivity, to Galleria mellonella
   larvae, of nematodes extracted from cores of substrate taken from the
   stack, was determined. There was a decline (P < 0.01) in the numbers of
   nematodes extracted on each of the sample dates. After the first sample
   was taken, fewer (P < 0.001) nematodes were recovered from the top layer
   of the stack than from the bottom or middle layers. Nematode infectivity
   declined (P < 0.001) over the first two months in the field and then
   remained at a constant low level until month 8. when no G. mellonella
   were parasitised. After removal of the stack, subsequent soil samples
   taken from plots that had been underlying, or adjacent to it, were
   baited with G. mellonella larvae. Samples of the haemolymph taken from
   larvae that died in the soil were tested with a monoclonal antibody
   specific to the bacterial symbiont (Xenorhabdus sp.) of Steinernema D1
   (IOW45). Using this method, Steinernema D1 (IOW45) was detectable in
   soil that had been underlying the compost stack for as long as 12 months
   after compost deposition.}},

Abstract = {{We measured horse density, social structure, habitat use, home ranges
   and altitudinal micro-climates in the south-western Kaimanawa ranges
   east of Waiouru, New Zealand. Horse density in the Auahitotara
   ecological sector averaged 3.6 horses.km(-2) and ranged from 0.9 to 5.2
   horses.km(-2) within different zones. The population's social structure
   was like that of other feral horse populations with an even adult sex
   ratio, year round breeding groups (bands) with stable adult membership
   consisting of 1 to 11 mares, 1 to 4 stallions, and their predispersal
   offspring, and bachelor groups with unstable membership. Bands and
   bachelor males were loyal to undefended home ranges with central core
   use areas. Band home range sizes varied positively with adult band size.
   Home ranges overlapped entirely with other home ranges. Horses were more
   likely to occupy north facing aspects, short tussock vegetation and
   flush zones and avoid high altitudes, southern aspects, steeper slopes,
   bare ground and forest remnants. Horses were more likely to be on north
   facing aspects, steeper slopes, in exotic and red tussock grasslands and
   flush zones during winter and at lower altitudes and on gentler slopes
   in spring and summer. Seasonal shifts by bands to river basin and stream
   valley floors in spring and higher altitudes in autumn and winter are
   attributed to the beginning of foaling and mating in spring and
   formation of frost inversion layers in winter. Given horse habitat
   selectivity and the presence of other ungulate herbivores, results from
   present exclosures are likely to exaggerate the size of horse impacts on
   range vegetation. Proposals to manage the population by relocation and
   confinement are likely to modify current social structure and range use
   behaviour and may lead to the need for more intensive management in the
   longer term.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial poisoning operations with carrot or cereal baits are used to
   control brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) populations in New
   Zealand forests for ecosystem conservation and to stop the spread of
   bovine tuberculosis to cattle and deer herds on adjacent farmland.
   Although various measures have been implemented to reduce the incidence
   of bird kills, dead birds continue to be found after poison operations.
   Colour-banded North Island tomtits (Petroica macrocephala toitoi) were
   monitored in treatment and non-treatment areas in Pureora Forest Park to
   determine the costs and benefits of aerial 1080 possum poisoning
   operations to tomtit populations. The August 1997 operation (carrot
   baits with very little chaff, 0.08 \% w/w 1080, 10 kg ha(-1)), resulted
   in 11 (79\%) of 14 tomtits disappearing, but none of nine from the
   non-treatment area. Whether the birds died of primary or secondary
   poisoning is unknown. No tomtits in either treatment or non-treatment
   areas disappeared following the August 1998 operation (cereal baits,
   0.08\% w/w 1080, 5 kg ha(-1)). The carrot bait operation resulted in
   almost all possums and rodents being killed, but a few possums and
   rodents survived the cereal bait operation, apparently because of a gap
   in bait distribution. During the 1997/98 nesting season, tomtit pairs in
   the 1997 treatment area had high nesting success (80\% of nests fledged
   chicks, mean of four fledglings per nest). Even so, by the following
   spring it seemed that the population had not recovered to its pre-poison
   level. Further research on this topic is warranted, the priority being
   to monitor tomtit mortality during more aerial 1080-cereal bait
   operations in order to assess the likely risks of using those baits.}},

Abstract = {{Tree weta (Hemideina) are an important component of New Zealand forest
   ecosystems and have been identified as possible invertebrate indicator
   species in restoration programmes. We present designs for artificial
   weta roosts that have been used to monitor tree weta in Hawke's Bay for
   five years. A variety of invertebrates use the roosts including two
   species of Hemideina. Our data suggest that occupation of roosts may
   take a number of years, each roost monitors a very limited area, and
   that occupation by invertebrates fluctuates seasonally. We recommend
   that data from weta roosts be used primarily for temporal rather than
   spatial comparisons, and that installation of roosts takes place as far
   ahead of changes in management as feasible.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated bird and small mammal use of two mowed (15 to 25 cm height)
   and two unmowed vegetation plots (40 to 88 ha) at John F. Kennedy
   International Airport (JFKIA), New York, in 1998 to 1999 to determine
   which management strategy would best reduce wildlife use of the airport.
   We counted more birds per 5-minute observation period in unmowed plots
   than mowed plots in both 1998 (9.0 versus 7.9) and 1999 (11.7 versus
   8.6). Maximum vegetation height was greater (P < 0.05) for unmowed areas
   than mowed areas after mowing commenced in 1998 and 1999 for each
   two-week monitoring period. In 1998 to 1999, vegetation density was also
   higher (P < 0.05) for unmowed plots for 13 of 14 sampling periods. The
   species composition of vegetation differed (X-2=20.54, df=3, P<0.01)
   among mowed and unmowed plots. Mowed plots contained a higher percentage
   of grasses (81\% versus 68\%), and a lower percentage of forbs (16\%
   versus 25\%) and woody plants (1\% versus 4\%) than unmowed plots.
   Vegetation was generally sparse in both unmowed and mowed plots, a
   consequence of the poor, sandy soils on much of the airport. We captured
   33 small mammals from three species in unmowed plots and 12 individuals
   of one species in mowed plots in 1999. Small mammal populations
   increased seasonally in unmowed plots, but remained constant in mowed
   plots over the same time period. We recommended JFKIA switch from the
   unmowed vegetation management regime in place since 1986 to a regime of
   maintaining vegetation mowed at 15 to 25 cm height. This management
   strategy should reduce bird and small mammal use of grassland areas at
   JFKIA. Further research should examine use of alternative vegetation
   types to improve ground cover and vegetation density at JFKIA while
   minimizing attraction to wildlife.}},

Abstract = {{Roost dispersal using pyrotechnics has been an effective program for
   reducing serious cormorant predation problems at catfish farms in
   Mississippi. Under a recent cormorant depredation order, catfish farmers
   are also allowed to shoot cormorants at their farms, but not at roosts.
   To potentially enhance cormorant roost dispersal programs and obtain
   data about shooting in roosts, I compared pyrotechnics versus shooting
   for dispersing cormorants from their night roosts. Five pairs of roosts
   were sequentially selected based on their similarity in numbers of birds
   and area occupied. By random selection each roost in the pair was
   harassed simultaneously using either pyrotechnics (screamer sirens and
   bird bangers) or shooting to kill with steel shot. Harassment of each
   roost took place during 1.5 hours before sunset and continued for up to
   three nights to disperse >90\% of the birds from the site. During
   harassment efforts we recorded the number of pyrotechnics and shotgun
   shells used as well as the amount of time of actual harassment. We then
   monitored each roost for up to 10 days to assess how quickly birds
   returned to these sites. We found no difference (P > 0.05) between
   treatments in the amount of time and shells used to disperse cormorants
   from their night roosts, or in the number of days post-treatment until
   birds returned to these sites. However, fewer shotgun shells ((x) over
   bar =286.6, SE=46.56) than pyrotechnics ((x) over bar =429, SE=81.3)
   were generally used. Despite deploying only skilled marksmen to shoot
   cormorants in roosts, relatively small numbers ((x) over bar =45.4,
   SE=11.14) of cormorants, comprising <5\% of roosting populations were
   killed during consecutive nights of harassment. I conclude that shooting
   is at least equally effective as pyrotechnics for dispersing cormorants
   from their night roosts and if included under the cormorant depredation
   order is unlikely to result in a large number of birds killed.}},

Abstract = {{Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) reduction strategies at Westover Air
   Reserve Base (ARB) conflict with recommended habitat management
   strategies for two State-listed grassland bird species that inhabit the
   Base-the upland sandpiper (Bartramia longcauda) and the grasshopper
   sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum). Westover ARB contains the largest
   contiguous grassland habitat in the New England region, comprising 1,600
   acres that surround the airfield. Annual breeding surveys, emphasizing
   the Upland sandpiper and Grasshopper sparrow, began in 1986. Initial
   surveys revealed that the implementation of habitat management
   suggestions provided by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and
   Wildlife (MDFW) resulted in a rapid rise in specie population levels.
   More recent surveys suggest that population levels stabilized as the
   habitat reached carrying capacity. State habitat management guidelines
   recommend prohibition of pedestrian and vehicle movement through the
   breeding grounds from April 20 through August 1. These guidelines
   conflict with U.S. Air Force (USAF) BASH reduction guidelines, which
   require mowing to reduce the attractiveness of the airfield to the
   overall grassland bird population. Conflict resolution efforts involving
   the installation, the USAF BASH Team, the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture-Wildlife Services, and the MDFW have produced limited
   success. However, an airfield Vegetation Management Plan has been
   developed in conjunction with these agencies to reduce the
   attractiveness of the grassland habitat to species that pose the
   greatest threat to aircraft safety (e.g., wild turkey, white-tailed
   deer, and gulls). Westover ARB personnel continuously monitor and modify
   management practices to reduce the BASH threat and also to maintain
   suitable habitat for sensitive grassland bird species on the Base.}},

Abstract = {{The Presidential Executive Order 13112 for control of invasive species
   signed by President Clinton illustrates the national concern over the
   negative impact that nutria (Myocastor coypus) and other non-native,
   invasive species have on the nation's natural resources. Nutria are
   established in 15 states nationwide and cause damage to agricultural
   crops and natural ecosystems. Despite efforts to control their
   populations, nutria are found in Maryland throughout the Eastern Shore
   and in the Potomac and Patuxent Rivers on the Western Shore.
   Twenty-three federal, state, and private organizations have combined
   their efforts to develop a three-year pilot plan for nutria control
   entitled ``Marsh Restoration: Nutria Control in Maryland.{''} In 1999
   and 2000, funding became available to begin the first year of the
   three-year pilot effort. The objectives of the pilot program are to
   develop accurate population estimates, determine effective trapping
   strategies to maximize nutria harvest and minimize impacts to non-target
   species, evaluate the effects of population control on nutria home range
   and movement patterns, determine how population control affects nutria
   reproductive behavior, determine if the health of nutria populations is
   influenced by intense harvest pressure, and monitor the effects of
   intense nutria harvest on vegetative response. Implementation of the
   control plan will begin during summer 2000.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring populations of problem species is an essential component for
   integrated damage reduction programs. Tracking population size through
   time and space helps define the potential magnitude and geographical
   extent of damage. Population size at an early stage of a crop cycle can
   serve as a predictor of damage levels later on, indicating whether
   control is necessary or what forms would be economically optimal. The
   ability to monitor for population change also permits assessment of the
   efficacy of the control methods for reducing numbers of a pest species.
   Methods for quantifying population levels can be as diverse as the
   number of subject species, the objectives of an IPM program, and whether
   direct estimates or indices of population parameters are required.
   Often, indirect methods involving counts of tracks, burrows, droppings,
   or food removal are used. We review methods used for a variety of
   wildlife species, examine the desirable characteristics for useful
   monitoring methods, and describe some of our current research on
   indexing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Biological control of vertebrate pest species has evolved from classical
   ``release and forget{''} strategies to current programs of integrated
   management, which in the future may include the use of genetically
   modified organisms. Key stages in the use of biocontrol are illustrated
   with the history of managing rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in
   Australia. Two pathogens have been successfully released, myxoma virus
   in the 1950s and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) virus in 1995, and
   both have been highly effective in suppressing rabbit populations. The
   rapid attenuation of myxoma virus, as well as bioclimatic constraints on
   its distribution, and the development of resistance in wild rabbits
   prompted the later release of insect vectors and highly virulent strains
   of the virus. The evolution of the current
   rabbit-myxomatosis-RHD-predator system is still being monitored, and
   research is in progress to add immunocontraceptive strains of myxoma
   virus to the suite of rabbit control techniques. Increased attention to
   measuring the outcomes of pest management resulted in a nationwide
   program to document the economic and environmental consequences of RHD.
   This program was conducted much more systematically than for
   introduction of myxoma virus or its vectors, and similar monitoring is
   likely to be mandatory for future biocontrol agents.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental assumption in the management of predators is that
   reducing predator numbers will reduce their predation impact on
   livestock. Research on dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) has shown this
   assumption to be incorrect in beef production areas in northern and
   western Queensland. Aerial and ground baiting with 1080 (fluoroacetate)
   is the principal dingo-control method used in extensive pastoral areas
   of Australia. This paper compares four approaches to measure the
   effectiveness of these control programs. Dingo abundance was reduced in
   11 of 13 baiting campaigns monitored with almost two-thirds of these
   producing > 50 \% reduction. However, concurrent decline in dingo
   abundance occurred in non-baited areas due to seasonal changes in dingo
   populations. When this was taken into account, less than half of the
   control programs produced >50\% reduction. The time taken for dingoes to
   recolonize baited areas is also an important measure of effectiveness.
   In two-thirds of the control programs, conducted in the first nine
   months of the year, dingoes recolonized prior to the period of peak
   calving (November/December) when the biggest threat to calves existed.
   The timing and the scale of control programs affect the rate of
   re-colonization. Calf loss was subsequently higher and occurred more
   frequently in baited areas compared to non-baited areas. Seasonal
   conditions, the status of prey populations and the impact of control
   programs on social organization and prey selection, are key factors
   affecting calf predation. Control programs should be assessed by
   measuring impact rather than changes in predator numbers. The assumption
   that a direct relationship exists between predator numbers and impact is
   not valid for dingoes in beef production areas in northern Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to establish tree seedlings on sites infested with high
   populations of pocket gophers (Thomomys spp.) can be futile unless
   population control measures are implemented. Fumigants are a possible
   means to reduce pocket gopher populations although the efficacy of
   fumigants on reforestation sites has been minimal. We conducted a series
   of experiments to monitor the movement of carbon monoxide through burrow
   systems and to assess the potential benefits of a blower system. In the
   first experiment, carbon monoxide was introduced to an artificial burrow
   system by burning either one or two gas cartridges concurrently or
   consecutively. The blower was tried at different speeds for varied
   durations. Carbon monoxide concentration was monitored with sensors that
   had a detection range from 0 to 5,000 parts per million. Burning the
   cartridges without the blower was not effective in distributing carbon
   monoxide. The most effective fumigant dispersal occurred when the blower
   was used at a low speed for only the period while a cartridge was
   burning. Burning two cartridges simultaneously was the most effective
   bum configuration. Results from a second experiment, using vacated
   pocket gopher burrows instead of an artificial system, were similar to
   those recorded for the first experiment. Subsequently, we conducted
   field trials using a blower to disperse carbon monoxide to reduce pocket
   gopher populations on reforestation sites. These trials did not
   demonstrate a reduction in pocket gopher activity. We speculate this was
   because existing burrow plugs prevented the gas from dispersing through
   the systems or because pocket gophers rapidly blocked burrows when they
   detected the gas, thus preventing exposure to lethal gas concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Techniques are described for research on deep-sea fishes using in situ
   lander platforms equipped with cameras for imaging fishes, sonars for
   tracking movements and other environmental monitoring sensors. Fishes
   are attracted to the vicinity of the platform by bait placed within view
   of the camera. Over most of the world's oceans at depths greater than
   3000 m the dominant scavenging fish is the grenadier Coryphaenoides
   (Nematonurus) armatus arriving at bait within 15-150 min depending on
   local population abundance. Applying an inverse square law relationship
   scavenger abundance can be calculated from fish arrival times. These
   fish show evidence of optimal foraging, staying longer at the bait if
   food is sparse. Ingestible acoustic transmitters embedded in baits allow
   tracking of fish departing from the bait source. Average radial rate of
   movement in the abyss is 1.75 cm s(-1) dispersing small food falls
   within a few hours. C. armatus in the north Pacific Ocean double their
   swimming speed in late summer associated with seasonal enrichment of the
   benthos with organic carbon. In situ techniques allow comparison of
   swimming performance of different species, allowing elucidation of
   mechanisms of niche separation in otherwise apparently similar fish.
   Autonomous lander platforms are proposed as an important adjunct to
   conventional research methods based on capture of dead specimens of fish
   from the wild.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the use of aquatic and terrestrial floodplain habitats
   by lentic and lotic turtles inhabiting the Missouri River, a
   contemporary, regulated large river. Specifically, we tested whether
   habitats were used differentially by turtle species, sexes, and life
   stages over biologically determined spatial and temporal scales. We
   monitored female and male false map turtles (Graptemys
   pseudogeographica) and slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) for 14 months,
   using radiotelemetry. In addition, over a 3-year period we trapped G.
   pseudogeographica (n=591) and T. scripta (n=129) to supplement data on
   habitat use. Movements based on radiotelemetry and recaptures were
   summarized for each individual. Both species of turtles displayed
   dynamic annual activity patterns and used diverse habitats including
   those typically considered terrestrial. Although G. pseudogeographica
   and T.: scripta spent a substantial portion of the year in the Missouri
   River (primarily in the cool months), newly created scour habitats also
   appeared to attract turtles during the cool season. However, in the warm
   months, habitat use became much more diverse, with turtles occupying all
   identified habitats including flooded agriculture and forest. Relative
   to their proportions, slough and scour habitats appeared to be highly
   favored while forests older than 4 years and agricultural habitats were
   proportionally less favored. We found few differences between species.
   However, males of both species were consistently more sedentary, used
   half as many habitats, and moved half as far from the river as did
   females, especially during May through July. Juveniles of both species
   were captured on average farther from the river than were adults,
   perhaps reflecting the close proximity of both nesting areas and
   shallow, productive habitats free of aquatic predators. We estimate a
   riparian zone of 449 m that encompasses 95\% of the population movements
   away from the river and discuss the quality of habitats important to
   reproduction and survival of lentic and lotic floodplain turtles. These
   spatial and temporal movement patterns, in light of their potential
   adaptive costs and benefits to G. pseudogeographica and T. scripta, are
   critical to understanding the ecology of long-lived vertebrates that
   depend on contemporary large rivers.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to make preliminary assessments of the effects
   of human activities on the gorillas and other wildlife in the
   Dzanga-Ndoki Park and broader Dzanga-Sangha Dense Forest Reserve (RDS),
   Central African Republic. During a month-long sun ev in 1997,
   observation and sign of humans and large mammals, including ape
   nest-sites, were recorded on 81.2 km of line transects in three sectors
   of the park and reserve. Human activities. including intensities of
   lugging and hunting, appeared to decrease with distance from the
   population centres and were lower an the park than in the reserve
   sectors. Encounter rates with sign of duikers Cephalophus spp., monkeys
   Cercopithecus spy. and Cercocebus albigena, elephants Loxodonta
   africana, and gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla were generally Ion er in
   regions of high human activity in the reserve than in the park sectors.
   Nevertheless, gorilla nest-site densities did not vary significantly
   between sectors or with human activity levels. A high frequency of zero
   (bare ground) nests at RES suggests that gorilla surveys that rely on
   line transect methods and use nest decomposition rates from other
   studies may sometimes underestimate gorilla densities. This study
   suggests that current levels of exploitation in managed hunting zones of
   national forest reserves may be negatively affecting targeted wildlife
   populations in these zones. Assessments should be a regular part of
   efforts to monitor the health of wildlife populations in managed
   protected zones. Participation by Central Africans in research will
   continue to benefit conservation and development efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The population of the threatened proboscis monkey Nasalis larvatus, a
   Bornean endemic, in the Pulau Kaget Nature Reserve, South Kalimantan,
   Indonesia, is extinct. Until 1997, this small, isolated population,
   estimated at c. 300 individuals, had been pushed towards the fringes of
   the reserve by illegal agricultural expansion. As food sources became
   depleted, the population apparently exceeded the decreasing carrying
   capacity of the reserve and was reported to be starving to death. As a
   solution, 84 animals were translocated to nearby, unprotected sites,
   resulting in 13 fatalities. An additional 61 animals were taken to a
   zoo, where 60 per cent died within 4 months of their capture. There was
   neither a proper pre-translocation assessment of the suitability of the
   release sites, nor a proper post-translocation monitoring programme for
   the released animals. We conclude that the Pulau Kaget reserve and its
   proboscis monkeys have been poorly managed. We provide some suggestions
   to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts in Indonesia.}},

Abstract = {{The tobacco whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae)
   which occurs in various parts of the world, has developed a high degree
   of resistance against several chemical classes of insecticide, including
   organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, insect growth regulators and
   chlorinated hydrocarbons. The present studies were done in order to
   monitor tho susceptibility of whitefly populations in southern Spain to
   insecticides commonly used there. Systemic bioassays using Spanish field
   populations of B tabaci collected in 1994, 1996 and 1998 indicated an
   increase, albeit a slow one, in resistance to imidacloprid over this
   period. Comparative studies of other neonicotinoids using the same
   bioassay revealed a high degree of cross-resistance to acetamiprid and
   thiamethoxam, Leaf-dip bioassays with adult females from these
   populations revealed a high level of resistance to cyfluthrin,
   endosulfan, monocrotophos, methamidophos, and pymetrozine, each at 200
   mg litre (1). Buprofezin and pyriproxyfen were tested against
   second-instar nymphs and eggs, respectively, Buprofezin also showed a
   lower efficacy against ESP-98, a strain of B tabaci received from
   Almeria in 1998, but pyriproxyfen resistance was not obvious when tested
   against eggs of strain ESP-98, Field trials in 1998 revealed good
   efficacy of imidacloprid in one farm In the Almeria region and two
   greenhouses in Murcia and Sevilla, but a loss of activity by
   imidacloprid In another farm in the Almeria region. Cross-resistance
   between imidacloprid and thiamethoxam was also confirmed under held
   conditions. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{French populations of codling moth have developed resistance to several
   insecticide classes, The susceptibility of susceptible and resistant
   laboratory strains to diflubenzuron and deltamethrin was evaluated using
   different exposure methods against various Life stages. The tarsal
   contact method for adults was found to be an appropriate method for
   testing neurotoxic compounds such as deltamethrin. Insect growth
   inhibitors, like diflubenzuron, need to be analysed on Juvenile instars.
   Monitoring methodologies were developed and evaluated (a) on neonates
   obtained by crossing field-collected males with virgin females from the
   susceptible laboratory strain so as to overcome the problem of reduced
   fertility of wild females and (b) on diapausing larvae. All 36
   populations analysed exhibited significant levels of resistance to both
   diflubenzuron and deltamethrin, Resistance to the two compounds was
   linked, regardless of the cultivation methods used in the monitored
   area. The monitoring methodologies will be implemented to evaluate the
   evolution of resistance according to the resistance management
   strategies that have been adopted. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic methods offer unique capabilities for photosynthesis
   research. Phenomena that are readily observed by photoacoustics include
   the storage of energy by electron transport, oxygen evolution by leaf
   tissue at microsecond time resolution, and the conformational changes of
   photosystems caused by charge separation. Despite these capabilities,
   photoacoustic methods have not been widely exploited in photosynthesis
   research. One factor that has contributed to their slow adoption is
   uncertainty in the interpretation of photoacoustic signals. Careful
   experimentation is resolving this uncertainty, however, and technical
   refinements of photoacoustic methods continue to be made. This review
   provides an overview of the application of photoacoustics to the study
   of photosynthesis with an emphasis on the resolution of uncertainties in
   the interpretation of photoacoustic signals. Recent developments in
   photoacoustic technology are also presented, including a
   microphotoacoustic spectrometer, gas permeable photoacoustic cells, the
   use of photoacoustics to monitor phytoplankton populations, and the use
   of photoacoustics to study protein dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The citrus thrips, Scirtothrips aurantii Faure (Thysanoptera:
   Thripidae), is a pest of mango in South Africa. The aim of the study was
   to monitor the different stages of S. aurantii in mango orchards
   throughout the year. Populations of S. aurantii were monitored using
   different methods, i.e., yellow sticky traps, dispersal/emergence traps,
   counts on fruit and in flowers. Eggs and emergence holes on the new
   leaves were recorded. The number of adults increased at the end of
   flowering (September) and remained at high levels until fruiting
   (November). Low numbers were present from May to August. Much higher
   population levels were present during 1995/96 than during the 1996/97
   season. There was higher infestation present on the cultivar `Sensation'
   than on `Zill'. S. aurantii was present on the fruit for only a short
   period (less than 10 weeks) during the season and the population was
   maintained on Rush that was present throughout the year.}},

   were tested for their final germination percentage (FG) in distilled
   water (DW) and in 25-400 mol m(-3) NaCl, germination rate (1/t(50),
   where t(50) is the time to 50\% of final germination in DW), Ca and K
   concentration (Ca-unt, K-unt), the leakage of these ions when soaked for
   24 h in DW (Ca-DW, K-DW) and the leakage (additional to that in DW) when
   soaked in 250 mol m(-3) NaCl (Ca-NaCl, K-NaCl). Linear regression
   revealed significant positive relationships between salinity tolerance
   (I-50, the concentration of NaCl required to reduce final germination to
   50\% of the control value in DW) and FG, Rate, Ca-unt/K-unt and
   Ca(NaC)l/K-NaCl. There was also a significant negative relationship
   between I-50 and K-unt. Multiple regression equations were developed to
   predict I-50 from the above parameters. Equations based on (1) FG and
   Rate, (2) Ca-unt and K-unt, and (3) any of these four factors, accounted
   for 61, 60 and 79\%, respectively, of the variation in I-50. Further
   equations, introducing the leakage of ions into DW and NaCl and the
   ratios of ion concentrations monitored, improved the predictive value of
   the equation. The best equation, accounting for 93\% of the variation
   was: I-50 = 108 + 422 Rate - 1.32 K-unt + 16.3 Ca-DW - 5.4 K-DW + 71.6
   K/Ca-DW. These equations provide a screening test for salt tolerance of
   Acacia seed germination based on simple and rapid laboratory chemical
   analyses and germination tests.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted in Heterodera glycines-infested fields in 40
   north central U.S. environments (21 sites in 1994 and 19 sites in 1995)
   to assess reproduction of this nematode. Two resistant and two
   susceptible soybean cultivars from each of the maturity groups (MG) I
   through IV were grown at each site in 6.1 m by 4 row plots. Soil samples
   were collected from each plot at planting and harvest and processed at
   Iowa State University to determine H, glycines initial (Pi) and final
   (Pf) population densities as eggs per 100 cm(3) of soil. Overall,
   reproduction (Pf/Pi) of H. glycines on susceptible cultivars in all MG
   was similar. Reproduction was higher on MG III and IV susceptible
   cultivars than on those in MG I and II. Resistant MG I and II cultivars
   reduced nematode population densities more consistently than those in MG
   III and IV. Reproduction of the nematode was similar among sites within
   the same maturity zone (MZ), defined as the areas of best adaptation of
   the corresponding MG. Nonetheless, careful monitoring of nematode
   population densities is necessary to assess changes that occur over time
   in individual fields.}},

Abstract = {{Disjunct populations of the perennial herb Gypsophila fastigiata L.
   (Caryophyllaceae) on the Baltic island of Oland were monitored during a
   thirteen-year study. The main objectives were to analyze the dynamic
   features of G. fastigiata within and among sub-populations in shorter
   and longer time perspectives, and to relate this to habitat
   characteristics and patterns in local weather variation. The total
   number of individuals decreased and the proportion of reproductive
   individuals increased throughout the study period. Recruitment and
   mortality on a fine spatial scale (0.25 m(2)) were negatively correlated
   to species richness and vegetation cover. Rapid changes in population
   sizes were observed during and after summers with low precipitation. The
   highest mortality rates were found in pre-reproductive stages whereas
   relatively many of the adult plants survived the droughts, The long-term
   trend of population decline in G. fastigiata could be a result of
   changes in vegetation structure due to changing grazing regimes. It
   might also be an effect of more frequent dry summers during the second
   half of the observation period or of an interaction between weather and
   changes in management. Another interpretation is that dynamic processes
   are taking place on a geographic scale not covered in the present study.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the response of ectotherms to ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) restoration treatments. The ambient body temperature
   of an ectotherm affects its physiology, development, and behavior.
   Microhabitat availability and heterogeneity are critical factors in
   determining which thermoregulation choices are available to a
   terrestrial ectotherm (Stevenson 1985). Forest restoration treatments
   (for example, thinning and burning) will alter herpetofauna
   microhabitats by decreasing tree canopy cover and allowing more sunlight
   penetration to the forest floor. This change could, depending on the
   species, have positive or negative effects on the populations of the
   area. We sampled microhabitat use by Sceloporus graciosus (sagebrush
   lizards) in northern Arizona at Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument
   using standard ``pitfall-array{''} sampling methodology. Univariate
   analyses were used to relate lizard abundance to ponderosa pine tree
   density, percent soil cover, percent rock cover, litter depth, and
   insect density. In a multivariate analysis, ponderosa pine density
   (negatively correlated) and bare soil cover (positively correlated) were
   the best predictors of lizard abundance. Restoration treatments will
   increase small-scale heterogeneity within S. graciosus territories by
   increasing accessibility into and out of sunlight. Based on the
   thermoregulatory demands of this species, these changes should benefit
   S. graciosus. However, other possible indirect effects of restoration
   treatments such as increases in predation on lizards (due to greater
   visibility), as well as changes in food availability, could negatively
   impact lizard populations. Future research should focus on pre- and
   postrestoration treatment monitoring of herpetofauna, and on the direct
   effects of fire on herpetofauna populations within restoration sites.}},

Abstract = {{The most important resource that mankind has, apart from innate
   intelligence, is germplasm. Because of the decrease in arable land and
   the projected increases in world population, many crops are being
   evaluated for their resident genetic diversity in order to formulate
   strategies for the effective and efficient deployment of genetic
   resources for plant improvement. We assessed 922 of 1345 accessions in
   the United States National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) cucumber
   (Cucumis sativus) collection using isozymes (14-21 loci) and random
   amplified polymorphic DNA(71 loci) to determine the population structure
   of this collection. We compared this population structure with the
   genetic diversity in an array of 118 diverse accessions grown
   commercially (released or currently in use as experimental lines) since
   1846. We found that the NPGS accessions are genetically diverse, that
   they are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and that they differ
   markedly from the commercial germplasm evaluated in their genetic
   structure. In contrast, the commercial germplasm exhibited a remarkably
   narrow genetic base, and thus could benefit from the introgression of
   exotic genes present NPGS accessions. Backcrossing strategies combined
   with continued monitoring of genetic diversity via molecular marker
   analysis would allow for relatively rapid (3 to 5 years) development of
   germplasm pools leading to homogeneous, but heterozygous, highly diverse
   populations for plant improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Hebei-Beijing-Tianjin(HBT) Plain is situated in the north part of the
   North China Plain, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Haihe
   River and Luanhe River. It includes 126 county, 31 cities of Hebei
   Province, Beijing City and Tianjin City, its area is about 83 thousand
   Square kilometers; the populations is about 6\% of total ones in China,
   the gross domestic product (GDP) was about 9\% of total ones in China in
   1999. Everyone own water resources reserves only are 1/7(338m(3)) of
   ones (2,221 m(3)) in China. The water resources are less than 25 billion
   m(3)/a, only 1\% of total ones in China At present, the using water
   amount has been more than 30 billion m(3)/a, over-exploiting 4 billion
   m(3)/a. The landform type can be divided into: (1) the foreland alluvial
   pluvial plain; (2) the middle alluvial lacustrine plain and (3) the
   littoral alluvial marine-deposition plain. The groundwater system can be
   divided into 8 sub-systems. The water-bearing Quaternary system are
   divided into the shallow and deep hydrous second systems. The bottom of
   shallow ground water system are often 40 similar to 150m below the
   surface, the depth of deep groundwater second system are generally from
   XO to 360m below the surface. With the development of the economy and
   society, the lack of water resources in nature, the low efficiency of
   water utilization ratio, the impertinency of distribution of industry
   and water resources condition, a series of environmental geological
   problems have occurred. (1) The underground water table has sustained
   the decline. The shallow underground water table decline velocities
   reached respectively 0.25 similar to1.0m/a: 0.75 similar to2.25m/a. in
   1995, (2) The depression cones of the underground water table have
   continued the enlargement. At present, the main depression ones of the
   shallow and deep underground water lever have 18, the cone areas have
   extended 16,000 km(2). Jizhou-Zaoqiang-Hengshui deep cone, its areas got
   5,668 km(2) in 1995. its central water level depths reached 86.97 m in
   1999. (3) The water-bearing rock association drained. the area of first
   water-bearing rock association drained or the approach drainage reached
   about 8,8000km(2) in the fore land alluvial pluvial plain, a general
   dewatering depths were about 10 similar to 45m. (4) Land subsidence and
   ground fracture. The monitor had discovered 14 subsidence centers. Up to
   1995 region area of the accumulative total subsidence 200 similar to
   500mm reached 42,120km(2), more than 1,000mm got about 1,000 km(2), the
   biggest accumulative subsidence amount had reached 2,760mm, the biggest
   subsidence velocity was about 84mm/a. (5) Seawater and salt water
   intrusion. The countermeasure are: (1) The utilizing efficiency of water
   resources must be improved. The important measure will be the saving
   water irrigation of agriculture and the saving water of industry, the
   saving water type society should be set up progressively. (2) The
   important pollution should be harnessed strongly, the sewage as the
   reusing water resources should be realized step by step. (3) The
   agriculture and the industry should make use of the seawater and the
   salt water, because of Bohai Sea near to the east of HBT Plain. (4) The
   South-to-north water transfer project will be a important measure, which
   relaxes the water deficit situation and recovers the ecology balance,
   the goal will be realize water resources and society and economy
   sustainable development in HBT Plain.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts have been initiated to meet the needs of the very small public
   water systems. The EPA classifies drinking water treatment systems that
   serve less than 10,000 people as ``small.{''} This paper further
   categorizes these ``small{''} systems based upon population served:
   10,000 to 3,301 as small systems, 3,301 to 501 as very-small systems,
   and fewer than 500 as micro-systems (USEPA, 1989). The micro-systems
   face the biggest challenge to meet the local, state and federal drinking
   water regulations (NRC, 1997) This paper focuses on the micro-systems
   because they face intense challenges to meet local, state, and federal
   drinking water regulations. In many parts of the United States (US),
   most of the troubled systems fall into the micro-systems category.
   Micro-systems typically serve a population between 30 and 300 and are
   most common in rural economically depressed areas. Because of the
   financial constraints faced by the operators of these micro-systems, it
   is virtually impossible for them to consider advanced up-to-date water
   treatment and monitoring and control technologies. The small customer
   base results in higher unit prices of goods and services and these
   increased costs have a greater impact on water rates. Thus, the
   micro-system operators generally lack the financial and technological
   capacity to meet safe drinking water regulations. Also, attitude of the
   consumer makes it difficult for the utility/operators to justify higher
   water rates to upgrade water treatment operations. Most of the operators
   of micro-systems are volunteers who have other primary employment and
   can not attend the requisite operator training seminars. Thus,
   micro-systems also suffer from a lack of qualified operators. The micro
   system operators or utility services must seek out new management
   methods to overcome the factors mentioned above.
   Small packaged SCADA/Telemetry ``smart{''} systems provide a unique tool
   that could help treatment operators comply with operations, regulatory
   requirements, and consumer basic needs. The use of a telemetry system
   will allow a single qualified operator to monitor, control, and
   coordinate operations and maintenance of several treatment plants from a
   central location. A fully functional smart SCADA/Telemetry system can be
   a very dependable and reliable tool for monitoring and controlling small
   treatment systems.
   This paper will provide an overview of the EPA work to date, problems
   encountered and/or resolved, and benefits of an appropriately designed
   and successfully deployed SCADA/Telemetry system at an EPA test site
   located in rural McDowell County, West Virginia. The following provides
   background of the implementation of remote monitoring and control
   technology for small drinking water treatment systems.}},

Abstract = {{We have made a detailed cytological examination of the development of
   wheat embryoids, monitoring their initial divisions from two to ten
   cells by both light and electron microscopy. According to our
   observations the first embryogenic division is symmetrical. After the
   androgenesis induction treatment, there is a decrease in ribosome
   population with cells that have inactive nucleoli made up almost
   exclusively of a dense fibrillar component. This population is restored
   after initial embryogenic divisions. During the initial divisions the
   embryogenic pollen grains do not appear to change in size and the pollen
   wall remains intact. The exine undergoes no modification but the intine
   thickens, and we have observed that the thickness of the intine can be
   used as a cytological marker of androgenesis. The walls separating the
   cells obtained after embryogenic division contained numerous
   plasmodesmata. The beginnings of embryo polarization and cell
   differentiation could be made out in the very early pollen embryoids.}},

Abstract = {{Anglesey has one of the highest populations of barn owl within the UK.
   Incomplete, paper-based, records date from 1965, their conversion to
   digital format allowed spatial aspects the data to be investigated. The
   island's Environmentally Sensitive Area status provides a funding
   opportunity to further enhance the population of barn owl in conjunction
   with the measures being adopted under the Local Biodiversity Action
   Plan. Some 72\% of nest sites and 66\% of roost sites occur within ESA
   farms. An inductive GIS modelling approach was shown to produce
   acceptable results in predicting suitable habitat. Changes in recording
   methods are suggested given 12 km(2) (1.6\%) of the study area remains
   unsurveyed, whereas some 78 km(2) (10.4\%) is surveyed by 3 recorders.}},

Abstract = {{General methodology for reconstruction of the internal dose in groups of
   inhabitants of the Chernobyl accident area is considered, and practical
   techniques for reconstruction of the I-131 absorbed dose in thyroid and
   the effective doses of Cs-137 and Cs-134 radiation are examined. The
   techniques are based on the results of radiation monitoring performed
   since 1986 in the Bryansk, Tula, Orel and Kaluga regions of Russia. The
   WBC measurements of the thyroid or whole body provide the data most
   relevant to internal dose, and are of first priority for dose
   reconstruction. Radionuclide intake estimation with food products is
   considered as the second priority and application of radioecological
   models as the third priority when measurement data are absent. For the
   calculation of internal dose intake functions are suggested that
   describe both consequences of vegetation surface contamination with
   I-131 and Cs-134,Cs-137 in the early period and long-term radionuclide
   transfer via root systems. The first experimental data on the dependence
   of I-131 concentration in milk on time, and on density of soil
   contamination with Cs-137 in four regions of Russia are given. A strong
   connection between I-131 concentration in milk and thyroid dose in
   inhabitants based on I-131 in thyroid measurements is proved.
   Regularities revealed are used for thyroid dose reconstruction in
   Russian inhabitants. The results explain the phenomenon of the increased
   thyroid cancer morbidity in areas with low radioactive contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Good quality research to study behaviour in the sun is needed in the UK
   to ensure that we can develop the most effective methods for ultimately
   reducing the incidence of skin cancer. Many initiatives have taken place
   during the past two decades to reduce the level of sun exposure.
   However, there have been relatively few studies to evaluate the impact
   of these initiatives on behaviour and health. This review summarises
   outcome measures of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour and of clinical
   signs of sun damage. The results of evaluation studies show that
   adolescents are a group resistant to change. Initiatives should focus on
   families with young children. Targeting holiday makers at the time of
   departure also proved to be ineffective. Future research should aim to
   monitor changes in behaviour in the general population, and to study
   changes among target groups using standardised methods. The costs of
   different interventions should be compared.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring land use changes is very important data for urban and
   regional planning. Remote Sensing Technology can provide a method for
   acquiring regular, recent information for land use. Geographic
   Information System with its widespread usage is also a powerful tool for
   urban and regional planning. The integration of Remote Sensing
   Technology and GIS will provide maximum data processes in land use
   planning. Omerli Water Basin is one of the major water dams which
   supplies 40\% of drinking water of the city and approximately covers an
   area of 620 square kilometers. Population in the water basin has shown a
   drastic increase since 1985. The rapid urbanization in the area is
   serious concern for researches, planners and even inhabitants of the

Abstract = {{Many issues in fundamental and applied ecology require the use of
   sampling protocols at the sectoral or even regional scales at which many
   important ecological mechanisms occur. The lack of workable sampling
   methods at these scales is a major obstacle to the analysis and
   understanding of these mechanisms. We test the validity of an index
   method of estimating relative population densities, applicable along
   transects of several kilometers in length, for a population of Common
   Voles (Microtus arvalis). The results show that the index method of
   estimating relative density is well adapted for monitoring variations in
   the abundance and spatial distribution of Common Vole populations and
   authorizes studies for a wide range of objectives and spatial scales.}},

   higher in seed orchard populations than in natural populations of
   similar latitudinal origin. The number of stem-units (NSU) was
   correlated with tree height and leader shoot length. NSU and elongation
   of stem-units appeared to be primarily influenced by summer temperature.
   Prolonged MI activity in autumn did not result in high NSU but appeared

Abstract = {{The importance of casing bacteria for the pattern of mushroom fruitbody
   initiation has been studied. Bacterial populations of different casing
   materials, such as coir and peats, were found to vary greatly. Of the
   casing materials tested only activated charcoal and lignite retained an
   ability to stimulate mushroom primordia formation when sterilized.
   Isolated casing bacteria (mainly Pseudomonas putida, also an Alcaligenes
   sp.) were assessed for their effect on mushroom primordia using an agar
   plate bioassay and microcosms containing cased mushroom spawn. Specific
   bacterial isolates, identified by ribotyping, were inoculated into
   microcosms to determine the effect of bacterial dose and timing on
   primordium formation. The stability and reproducibility of the bacterial
   effect, after storage by seven methods over I year, on initiation is
   reported. The bacterial effect diminished if isolates were regularly
   sub-cultured on agar. A molecular marking system (luxAB and tetracycline
   antibiotic resistance reporter genes) was used to monitor bacteria
   inoculated into non-sterile casing.}},

Abstract = {{In southwest Florida, significant declines in historical seagrass
   populations have been observed. Specifically, as much as 80\% of the
   seagrass beds in Tampa Bay have been lost since the late 1800s as a
   result of dredging, pollution, and reduced water clarity. Historical
   seagrass losses have also been documented in other coastal areas such as
   Charlotte Harbor and Sarasota Bay. This study was initiated to assess
   temporal and spatial changes in seagrass coverage in these estuaries and
   to monitor the effects of improvements in water quality on seagrass bed
   expansion.
   Using 1:24,000 scale aerial color photography, seagrass distributions
   were photointerpreted and transferred to a geographical information
   system (GIS) database for analysis. Based on trend analysis of the data,
   Tamps Bay and Sarasota Bay have experienced consistent, measurable gains
   in seagrass coverage since 1988. Seagrass coverage in Tampa Bay has
   increased an average of 2\% per year between 1988 and 1996. A remarkable
   7\% increase in seagrass coverage was observed between 1988 and 1994 in
   Sarasota Bay followed by an 11\% increase between 1994 and 1996. In
   Charlotte Harbor, a small decline in seagrass coverage occurred between
   1982 and 1992; however, a 2\% average annual increase has been observed
   between 1992 and 1996.
   Observed increases in seagrass coverage in Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay
   are believed to be directly linked to improving water quality and light
   penetration resulting from reductions in point-source pollutant loads.
   The timing and duration of riverine inflow, nutrient loading, and
   changes in water color can affect light penetration in Charlotte Harbor.
   The relationships between these factors and seagrass productivity appear
   to be more complex than in Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay. Further data
   collection will be necessary to associate water quality trends with
   seagrass community dynamics in this estuary.}},

Abstract = {{Successful relocation of Halophila johnsonii (Johnson's seagrass) may be
   essential for its long-term survival. H. johnsonii is one of the
   smallest and rarest seagrass species. It has a limited geographic range,
   and:within its range, it is discontinuous and patchy. Male flowers of H.
   johnsonii have never been found; populations may be maintained
   exclusively by vegetative growth arid reproduction. Based on these
   characteristics, H. johnsonii has been listed as threatened by the
   National Marine Fisheries Service.
   Reciprocal transplants were performed in May 1998 to determine the
   feasibility of relocation and restoration of local populations in the
   Indian River Lagoon, Florida. Three different sites were selected which
   varied primarily in mean depth, Light penetration, and degree of tidal
   exchange. Intact plugs of H, johnsonii, composed of leaf pairs, roots,
   rhizomes, and associated sediment, were harvested, put into peat pots,
   and transplanted within several hours of removal. Transplant and control
   plots were monitored biweekly for 30 weeks.
   The peat pot method was initially successful; however, all three
   recipient sites had different problems which ultimately caused the loss
   of all transplant materials. Lagoon Shallow site increased by week 4 to
   a maximum of 71\% cover, followed by an abrupt decline when plots were
   exposed due to low water levels in June/July. Lagoon Deep site initially
   increased to a maximum of 88\% cover, followed by a gradual decline as
   light decreased to only 1.3\% of surface incident light, well below
   seagrass light requirements; Sebastian Inlet site also showed an initial
   increase to a maximum of 95\% cover, followed by a gradual decrease
   associated with sediment burial and/or erosion. Although coverage
   declined at the transplant sites, beds of H. johnsonii at all three
   donor sites similarly declined, The mortality in the transplant plots
   was not necessarily a result of the methodology, but more Likely a
   reflection of the inherent dynamic nature of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Historical (pre-1930s) seagrass meadows in Tampa Bay are believed to
   have covered 31,000 ha of the shallow bay bottom. However, impacts to
   the bay from increasing population and industrial development of the
   Tampa Bay area resulted in large seagrass reductions. By 1982,
   approximately 8,800 ha of seagrass remained. Recently, Tampa Bay
   seagrass monitoring programs have shown that the trend of seagrass loss
   has been reversed. The bay-wide seagrass cover in 1997, was estimated at
   10,930 ha. In Hillsborough Bay, the bay segment that historically has
   had the poorest water quality, seagrass increased from near 0 ha in 1984
   to about 57 ha in 1998. The Tampa Bay seagrass expansion apparently
   started,in response to water quality improvements that occurred from the
   late 1970s to the mid-1980s, which included reductions in phytoplankton
   biomass and water column light attenuation. These improvements
   followed;a nearly 50\% reduction in external nitrogen loading from
   domestic and industrial point-sources, primarily discharging to
   Hillsborough Bay, that occurred in the early 1980s. However, most
   recently, high rainfall amounts during the years 1995, 1996, and the
   1997-1998 El Nino event increased nitrogen loading to the bay. Both
   phytoplankton biomass and light attenuation increased in all major bay
   segments during this period of high rainfall. These influences on
   seagrass growth are often detrimental and appear to have reduced the
   rate of seagrass expansion during the last few years.
   The reduced rate of expansion is most evident in the Hillsborough Bay
   section of Tampa Bay for which the most detailed and current seagrass
   information: is available. Recognizing the link between nitrogen
   loading, water quality, and seagrass protection, local, state, and
   federal partners working cooperatively through the Tampa Bay National
   Estuary Program (TBNEP) have agreed to adopt nitrogen loading targets
   for Tampa Bay based on the light requirements of Thalassia testudinum. A
   long-term goal has been adopted to achieve 15,400 ha of seagrass
   coverage, or 95\% of the seagrass estimated for 1950. Reaching the goal
   will require preservation of the approximately 10,400 ha of seagrass
   present in the bay in 1992 and restoration of an additional 5,000 ha.
   Field measurements in Tampa Bay indicate that 20-25\% of surface
   irradiance is required for sustained growth of T. testudinum. Two
   independent water quality models were used to estimate nitrogen loading
   rates and associated water column chlorophyll a concentrations required
   to maintain irradiance levels at the apparent maximum depth of seagrass
   growth in 1950 for each major bay segment. Based on monitoring data, it
   appears that light levels can be maintained at these depths in most bay
   segments with the existing nitrogen loading rates. However, to achieve
   the longterm seagrass restoration goal, increases in nitrogen loading
   associated with a projected increase in the watershed's human population
   must be offset.
   TBNEP partners have, therefore, identified and committed to specific
   nitrogen load reduction projects to ensure that nitrogen management
   targets are met. An interagency bay-wide seagrass monitoring program has
   been established to document the progress of Tampa Bay seagrass
   protection and restoration. Citizen-based educational and voluntary
   programs are underway to help reduce propeller scarring of seagrass
   meadows and to plant seagrass in areas which currently lack vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{A method is described for determining foraging territories of
   subterranean termites in the field through the use of a bait matrix
   impregnated with dye markers (Nile Blue A, 0.1\% wt/wt; Neutral Red,
   0.5\% wt/ wt) placed inside commercial monitoring/baiting stations
   (Sentricon Termite Colony Elimination System) or bucket stations. The
   method is useful at field sites for research related to the inter-colony
   interactions or baiting systems where the identity of different colonies
   and their foraging territories is important. The technique has been
   validated for Reticulitermes flavipes (9 colonies), R. virginicus (1
   colony), and Amitermes wheeleri (2 colonies) in Texas.
   Termites readily feed on the dyed matrix in the field and quickly
   acquire a very visible mark, which may persist for long periods. Dyed
   termites move quickly to other stations that are part of the same
   foraging territory (30-90 days). Based on spatial and temporal patterns
   of dye markers superimposed on the overall pattern of activity at study
   sites, termites bearing the dye markers are apparently moving
   through-out the entire foraging territory of individual colonies.
   Unlike standard mark-release-recapture methods this technique does not
   permit an estimate of numbers of foraging individuals in the colony.
   Advantages of this method are:
   1. Handling of termites is reduced to a minimum.
   2. Access to a laboratory is not required.
   3. The process is less labor intensive than mark-release-recapture
   techniques.
   4. Site visits can be kept to monthly intervals (or longer).
   5. With the exception of the specially prepared dyed matrix, the
   procedure can be done entirely with the use of standard commercial
   components or with a variety of previously described monitoring systems
   6. The process is simple enough that non-scientists could perform it
   with adequate training in the use of baiting systems.
   7. The technique can be easily integrated with a variety of experimental
   protocols, especially those that do not involve active ingredients,
   without a significant increase in effort.
   A field preference test confirms laboratory data showing that Nile Blue
   A is a feeding deterrent to termites when offered in close proximity to
   stations containing an identical matrix lacking the dye. Nonetheless,
   appreciable feeding was detected at all sites in the field indicating
   that matrix with Nile Blue A is still a palatable food source by
   comparison with existing sources of structural and naturally occurring
   wood.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation methods and criteria used to assess field efficacy of stand
   alone termite bait programs are described and compared. The four
   criteria examined are: 1) alate numbers; 2) activity on termiticidal
   baits; 3) monitors active prior to baiting; 4) post-treatment monitors
   (placed after termiticidal baiting). The justification, complexities and
   ambiguities, and interpretation of each criterion are discussed. Even
   apparent ``success{''} of termite baiting, meaning sustained absence of
   termites in all four evaluation contexts, should be interpreted with
   caution and a commitment to continued monitoring for any signs of
   termite activity. Given current termite detection, inspection, and
   monitoring techniques, a zero tolerance framework, although
   conservative, is an appropriately cautious approach to termite control
   through baiting.}},

Abstract = {{Population numbers of Knysna elephants Loxodonta africana africana.
   after having remained static for more than six decades, dwindled rapidly
   from an estimated 10 animals in 1970 to a single surviving individual.
   According to an explanatory model presented, the poor reproductive
   performance and population decline of the Knysna elephants are
   attributable to low nutrient/carbon ratios of the diet available to them
   in the predominantly forest environment to which they were largely
   confined as a result of residential and agricultural development in the
   region. The low dietary N/C ratios are postulated to result in low
   metabolic turnover rates and therefore, reproductive rates too low to
   offset mortalities During 1994 three sub-adult female elephants from the
   Kruger National Park were translocated to the Knysna forest area
   (southern Cape, South Africa) in order to supplement the dwindling
   population. Monitoring of habitat choice and nutritional faecal
   parameters of both the translocated and a Knysna cow elephant tend to
   support the postulates of the explanatory model. The translocated
   elephants did not remain with the matriarch (Knysna elephant) and
   progressively chose to range in more open habitat outside of the
   Afromontane forest area. Analyses showed that the diet selected by the
   translocated elephants had higher assimilable N/C ratios than that of
   the Knysna elephant. The results of the study emphasise the importance
   of clearly differentiating between sink and source habitat in
   conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{In a transition zone between Andean forests and Patagonian steppe, local
   populations of five sympatric species of sigmodontine rodents (Abrothrix
   longipilis, A. xanthorhinus, Eligmodontia morgani, Oligoryzomys
   longicaudatus, Reithrodon auritus) were examined for their microhabitat
   use. The study area represents a herbaceous steppe with sparse bushes.
   Over a four-year period, monthly samples were obtained by baited traps.
   The vegetation cover at each trapsite was monitored. The capture
   frequency in a particular microhabitat turned out to be strongly
   correlated with the local vegetation cover. This result is interpreted
   as a species-specific selection at a fine spatial scale of those
   microsites which resemble the characteristic environment in the area of
   main biogeographic occurrence of each of the rodents. The data on
   preferential microhabitat use might gather importance considering that
   two of these sigmodontine species are Hantavirus reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine the relative effectiveness of
   track-plates compared to cameras for detecting carnivores in
   California's north coast oak woodland and agriculture interface. Results
   from covered track-plate and remotely-triggered camera data were
   compared across 6 different sites. Track-plates detected fewer species,
   and the probability of not detecting a species that was present at a
   site was higher for track-plates than for camera systems. Cameras also
   were effective at detecting target species without bait. Use of
   non-baited, remotely-triggered cameras is recommended for monitoring of
   opossum. and carnivore populations in oak woodland habitat of

Abstract = {{An evaluation of the 24 existing pond systems for treatment of urban
   wastewater in Catalonia (north-eastern Spain) was conducted in
   1997-1998. The evaluation covered 13 aerated ponds, 7 waste
   stabilization ponds (WSP), and 4 maturation ponds added to conventional
   biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The technical
   characteristics of the pond systems were obtained through a survey
   completed during several visits to the plants. Performance data was
   supplied by the Catalonia Wastewater Agency and the monthly monitoring
   campaigns conducted during 12 months in five WWTP. The average ratio of
   water surface to population equivalent (p-e) is 1.3 m(2)/p-e for aerated
   ponds, 9.6 m(2)/p-e for WSP and 1.7 m(2)/p-e for maturation ponds added
   to conventional WWTP. Average electrical energy consumption is 0.5
   kW.h/m(3) for aerated ponds and 0.04 kW.h/m(3) for WSP (when wastewater
   has to be pumped from the sewer). Most of the WSP show an inadequate
   level O \& M, because the very limited operator attendance (0.6 h/day on
   average) as compared to aerated ponds (3.2 h/day on average). Effluent
   quality of aerated ponds (31 mg SS/I and 21 mg BOD,II, on average) is
   usually better that of WSP (100 mg SS/I and 67 mg BOD5/I, on average).
   Most of the WSP are overloaded, with only two of the pond systems
   receiving less than 50 kg BOD5/ha. Facultative WSP show a better
   performance than anaerobic WSP; anaerobic WSP have very high overloading
   conditions (with more than 250 ka BOD5/ha.d). Average affluent quality
   of all the pond systems studied comply with European Union standards.}},

Abstract = {{Within the last 15 years 34 waste stabilization pond systems have been
   built in Central America in the countries of El Salvador (8 systems),
   Honduras (12 systems), Guatemala (9 systems), and Nicaragua (8 systems);
   these systems were built for municipalities with populations ranging
   from 5,000 to 80,000 persons. There are 14 additional systems in the
   final design phase or under construction in the region, including the
   first designs for large cities: a 162 hectare facultative system for
   Managua, Nicaragua (population ( 1,000,000); and a 168 hectare system
   for San Pedro Sula, Honduras (population (640,000). Monitoring data from
   Honduras and Nicaragua show that treatment efficiency is generally
   comparable to tropical pond systems cited in the literature in other
   parts of the world, although fecal coliform removal has not been as good
   as theoretically predicted and the desludging of facultative ponds has
   been a significant operational cost. While waste stabilization ponds are
   generally considered the technology of choice for municipal wastewater
   treatment within Central America. theta are, nevertheless, problem areas
   that need to be addressed if waste stabilization pond use is to have
   continued acceptance and longterm sustainability. These areas of concern
   at the regional level are: i) design guidelines using parameters from
   data developed in Central America; ii) effluent guidelines that are
   realistic for pond effluents for reuse or surface water discharge; iii)
   monitoring programs focusing specifically on pathogen removal; iv)
   cost-effective grit removal and sludge removal from facultative ponds;
   v) improving designs for pathogen removal; vi) the need for centralized
   (El Salvador and Nicaragua) versus decentralized (Guatemala and
   Honduras) mechanisms for financing and operation and maintenance; vii)
   the development of comparative cost data for construction, operation and
   maintenance, pond desludging, and microbiological monitoring; and viii)
   the development of training programs for design, operation and
   maintenance, and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 100L volumes of treated water are
   simulated for conditions representative of a waterborne outbreak in a
   surface water-derived supply. Assuming oocysts act independently during
   infection, the risk of infection is directly related to the arithmetic
   mean oocyst density in the water supply, which is in turn related to the
   total number of oocysts which break through treatment. Spatial/temporal
   heterogeneity of oocyst concentrations in the treated water contributes
   to monitoring programmes based on ``spot-sampling{''} underestimating
   the arithmetic mean oocyst density and hence the risk of infection. This
   could contribute to the reported lack of a clear association between
   oocyst concentrations measured in drinking water supplies and the risk
   of waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the population. An
   increase in spatial heterogeneity of oocysts during treatment could also
   contribute to an overestimation of the net oocyst removal by treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The microbial ecology of the sequential, leach-bed, mesophilic anaerobic
   digestion of unsorted, coarse municipal solid waste (MSW) was examined
   over 80 days. The methane yield was approximately 75\% of the ultimate
   biochemical methane potential (BMP) of the waste loaded into the
   digesters. The operational strategy involved a sequence of two digesters
   containing fresh and anaerobically stabilised MSW respectively. Cell
   wall phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and ether lipid (PLEL) analysis was
   used to monitor changes in microbial biomass. Both Bacterial and
   Archaeal biomass were heavily influenced by pH during the two-week start
   up period. Archaeal biomass peaked just before the methane production
   rate reached a maximum whereas Bacterial biomass peaked at a later
   stage. Changes in the phylogenetic diversity of the population were
   monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). An analysis
   of the changes in DGGE banding patterns suggested that rapid start-up of
   a new reactor was effected by inoculation as well as the provision of
   buffering capacity from the mature reactor leachate.}},

Abstract = {{Two nitrifying reactors were operated under the same conditions except
   that one was twice inoculated with the aerobic denitrifying bacteria
   Microvirgula aerodenitrificans. The first bioaugmentation induced a
   transient nitrogen loss. Fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that
   the bioaugmented bacteria had been rapidly eaten by protozoa. The second
   massive inoculation unbalanced the ecosystem and resulted in an
   overgrowth of protozoa and perturbations of nitrification, whereas both
   parameters remained stable in the non bioaugmented reactor. To enhance
   the incorporation of the added bacteria to indigenous flocs, two
   strategies were then tested. First, coagulating and flocculating
   substances were added to the reactor just after bioaugmentation and
   second, the bacteria were embedded in alginate beads before inoculation.
   The latter strategy gave the best results. After break-up of the beads,
   alginate fragments, containing microcolonies of M. aerodenitrificans,
   were found to be incorporated into the existing flocs. Alginate beads
   offer a temporary protection against grazing and favor the adhesion of
   the exogenous bacterial microcolonies to the existing flocs. These beads
   therefore constitute a suitable bioaugmentation vector to incorporate a
   bacterial strain into activated sludge flocs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigated the development of anaerobic biofilm using
   a laboratory reactor. We were especially interested in comparing the
   organization of anaerobic cells (particularly those that are very common
   in domestic sewage sludge) in a hydrophilic (glass) versus a hydrophobic
   (polypropylene) surface. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with
   domain and group specific probes directed against 16S ribosomal RNA were
   used to quantify microbial composition in the biofilm, FISH and confocal
   laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to elucidate spatial
   distribution of microbes in the biofilms. Two experiments were carried
   out, one with pure methanogenic organisms and the other with a microbial
   anaerobic consortium. The pure methanogen cultures, Methanobacterium
   formicicum (DSM 1535); Methanosaeta concilli (DSM 3671) and
   Methanosarcina barkeri (DSM 800) were used to seed the modified Robbins
   Device (MRD) to allow the development of biofilms on polypropylene and
   glass surfaces during the 9-days experiment, The results showed that all
   the three species were colonizing both surfaces after two and nine days
   of experimental period. In another experiment, with polypropylene
   coupons only, MRD was seeded with a microbial anaerobic consortium and
   biofilm formation was studied during 11 days. At the end of this period,
   the biofilms generated were of uneven thickness with areas of minimal or
   no surface coverage and areas where the biofilm attained a thickness of
   7.0 to 9.0 mu m as revealed by CLSM. The results showed that the
   modified Robbins Device together with the, fluorescent in situ
   hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy are suitable tools
   to study anaerobic biofilm development in different kinds of support
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine recent trends in cormorant
   wintering populations and their economic impact in the delta region of
   Mississippi and to examine the response of these populations to
   management efforts directed at reducing their predation on channel
   catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). We monitored Double-crested Cormorant
   (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations in the delta region of Mississippi
   through the use of midwinter ground counts and aerial surveys during the
   winters of 1995-96 through 1998-99 and surveyed the reported take of
   cormorants hv catfish farmers in the region under the recently-enacted
   Cormorant Depredation Order. This order issued by the U.S. Fish and
   Wildlife Service in March, 1998 allowed catfish farmers in the region to
   kill unlimited numbers of cormorants seen causing depredations at their
   farms. Despite roost dispersal programs and continued harassment of
   birds at farms, cormorant populations have significantly increased and
   based on ground counts have doubled from approximately 32,000 birds to
   more than 64,000 birds between 1995 and 1999. Mid-winter ground counts
   and aerial counts were highly correlated and the best linear prediction
   of ground counts (Y) from aerial counts (b) took the form Y = 1.55 b,
   (Y-intercept = 0). Roost dispersal programs continue to have the desired
   effect of shifting birds away from areas of highest catfish
   concentration, but these effects are temporary at best. However, without
   such programs, the impact of cormorant depredations on the catfish
   industry in 1997-98 and 1999-98 probably would have more than doubled
   compared to previous years. Catfish farmers in the delta region of
   Mississippi reported taking more cormorants under the Cormorant
   Depredation Order than previously reported under past depredation
   permits issued to individual farmers. The reported take of at least
   9,557 birds by Mississippi catfish Farmers had no apparent impacts on
   wintering populations during 1998-99, Further monitoring of cormorant
   wintering populations over more of their wintering range is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Factors influencing initiation of regional and interregional movements
   by nonbreeding ducks are poorly understood, especially during winter.
   During winters 1990-1991 through 1992-1993, we radiotagged 347 female
   Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) in southwestern Louisiana and monitored
   their movements to three regions: (1) the Gulf Coast Region of Louisiana
   and Texas (outside of southwestern Louisiana), (2) the Rice Prairie
   Region of Texas, and (3) the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. We found that
   adult females were 1.9 times more likely than were immatures to emigrate
   from southwestern Louisiana during winter. During winters 1980-1991 and
   1991-1992, fe males were more likely to emigrate during stormy than
   during fair weather; whereas they were more likely to emigrate during
   fair weather in 1992-1993. Females were more likely to emigrate during
   duck-hunting seasons than during nonhunting seasons, regardless of
   weather. Daily emigration probabilities did not differ in relation to
   body condition when released (body mass adjusted for body size) or to
   number of previous emigration events. Each winter, large numbers of
   females consistently moved from the Gulf Coast Region to areas with
   abundant rice (Oryza sativa) agriculture within the Mississippi Alluvial
   Valley. We conclude that destination of interregional movements hv this
   population of Northern Pintails is highly predictable, and that
   initiation of such movements is influenced by female age and long-term
   winter precipitation patterns in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.
   Furthermore, timing of these movements is predictable, based not on
   calendar date, but rather on duck-hunting seasons and, usually, the
   environmental cues to habitat availability provided by stormy weather.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored radio-marked female American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes)
   and Mallards (A. platyrhynchos) in agricultural landscapes of southern
   Quebec in 1994-1996 to characterize nesting habitat, and to compare
   nesting success and female survival rates. In early spring, when nesting
   cover is almost non-existent in agricultural fields, both species avoid
   fields for nesting. These habitats are rather used later in cases of
   renesting. Both species selected recent wood cuts and edge-transition
   habitats (abandoned farmland, hedgerows and riparian areas) as nesting
   habitat. Median nest initiation date, clutch size, and nest success
   rates did not differ between the two species. Especially high Black Duck
   nesting success (100\%) in peatlands underlines the importance of these
   habitats. When peatland nests are excluded to provide a better
   indication of what prevails in typical agricultural landscapes, nesting
   effort of female Mallards is almost twice that of Black; Ducks. Survival
   nhs of females were similar for both species, both during laying and
   post-laying periods.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding range of the Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia) covers large
   parts of six geographic regions in North America. We obtained data from
   individuals who monitor colonial waterbirds to determine current status
   and distribution of the Caspian Tern in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and
   to report regional population trends. We estimate 32,000-34,000 pairs
   nested in North America from the late 1980s to 1998. The species'
   breeding range is expanding along the Pacific coast and in central
   Canada. Over the last three decades numbers of breeding pairs have
   significantly increased in the Great Lakes, central Canada, and along
   the Gulf and Pacific coasts; the Atlantic coast is the only region where
   significant decline has occurred. On the Pacific and Calf coasts, large
   numbers of Caspians utilize artificial habitat (e.g., dredge spoil
   islands, salt dikes and levees, landfills, artificial lakes). Changes in
   food supply may be at least partly responsible for population increases
   in the Great Lakes, on the Pacific coast, and in central Canada in
   Manitoba. Other factors that may contribute to increases include
   creation of artificial habitat that Caspian Terns find attractive for
   nesting, and legislation that protects Caspian Terns and their habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Black Tem (Chlidonias niger) populations are threatened in several
   regions of North America and are increasingly the subject of monitoring
   and research efforts. To focus future studies on critical information
   needs, I used a population model to determine the sensitivity of
   population growth rate (r) of Black Terns to reproductive and survival
   estimates commonly measured in field studies, and developed research
   priorities based on these results and a review of the Literature.
   Sensitivity was estimated by two methods: 1) percent change in r
   resulting from a 10\% increase in a parameter's value and 2) percent
   change in r resulting from an increase in the value of a parameter by an
   increment equal to 10\% of the range of field estimates for that
   parameter. For 10\% changes in baseline rates, r ic as more sensitive to
   adult (168\% increase in r) and sub-adult survival (62\%) rate than to
   reproductive estimates (4-31\%) as expected; however, when sensitivity
   was examined relative to variation in estimates for wild populations,
   adult survival, chick survival and nest success had similar effects
   (33-38\%). Clutch size, hatchability, renesting rate, proportion of
   2-year-old terms breeding, and longevity had relatively less influence
   on r (4-10\%). Adult and chick survival rates should be high priorities
   for future study because adult rates are important for evaluating
   breeding success data and chick survival rates are needed to estimate
   productivity Sub-adult survival is important, but will be difficult to
   study in small populations. Clutch size and hatchability information
   should have lower priorities. Although sensitivity to renesting rate was
   low, the lack of information justifies a greater emphasis. For nest
   success, the research emphasis needs to change from monitoring rates to
   quantifying limiting factors.}},

Abstract = {{We determined population status and reproductive success of Piping
   Plovers ( Charadrius melodus) at Lake of the Woods, Minnesota during
   1988-2000. This is the only remaining breeding population of Piping
   Plovers in the state and is the last geographic link between the Great
   Lakes and Northern Great Plains populations. Previous studies, beginning
   in 1982, recorded populations of up to 50 birds at this location in
   1984. Since then, despite intensive management attempts to improve
   reproductive success, numbers have gradually declined to a lo rv of six
   birds in 1997. Of 88 nests monitored over 13 years, 54.6\% hatched,
   18.2\% were depredated, 13.6\% were destroyed by storm waves and 13.6\%
   were abandoned. The number of chicks fledged per breeding pair ranged
   from 0.0-2.7 ((x) over bar = 1.1) among years. Varying water levels
   either exposed broad sandy beaches or led to inundation of Piping Plover
   nests and substantial erosion of breeding habitat. Management activities
   included seasonal posting of sanctuaries, trapping of mammalian
   predators, destruction of Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) nests,
   use of elevated string gull deterrents, use of predator exclosures
   around nests, destruction of American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos)
   nests, and removal of trees and shrubs. Despite these efforts, during
   most years, fledging rates have been below those believed necessary for
   population stability.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns in the community structure of darkling beetle (9 Eleodes sop..
   Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) assemblages in the shortgrass steppe of north
   central Colorado were monitored by live pitfall trapping for 4 summers.
   There were significant correlations among weather (temperature and
   precipitation), species richness, and number of individuals per species
   captured; effects cts from weather conditions also displayed 1-month and
   l-yr delayed effects. Population densities of 2 eleodid species were
   monitored by mark-recapture methods. Densities of these species varied
   relatively little among years and sites, although density was correlated
   with temperature and precipitation. Abiotic influences on both density
   and richness differed between 2 macrohabitat types (shortgrass upland,
   shrub floodplain). The 4 largest species were most abundant in the
   floodplain, whereas the smallest species was most common in thr upland.
   difficulties with cactus and shrub, microhabitats (and an avoidance of
   bare soil) were evident, although a preference for shaded microhabitats
   was not detected. These results do not conform well to previous
   explanations of why darkling beetle assemblages are spatially and
   temporally heterogeneous, which primarily focused on predation and
   thermoregulation. Therefore, an alternative mechanism concerning
   scale-dependent uses of heterogeneity and mobility is proposed to
   account for eleodid community patterns.}},

   pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius) in the White River, Colorado and Utah}},

Abstract = {{Twelve wild adult Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius), captured
   in the tailwaters of Taylor Draw Dam on the White River, Colorado, were
   implanted with radio transmitters and their movement patterns monitored
   from 1992 to 1994. The spawning migration of these fish was extensive.
   In 1993, the only full year of the study, the fish migrated an average
   of 658 km from the White River to spawning sites in the Yampa or Green
   rivers and back to the White River. Eight of these fish were
   translocated in the river upstream of the dam in April 1993. These fish
   and the 4 others below the dam remained in the river until May 1993. All
   12 had migrated down the White River to spawning sites in the Green and
   Yampa rivers by July 1993. The fish that were located above the dam
   successfully passed over the dam during their downstream migration.
   Seven fish migrated upstream toward the Yampa River Canyon spawning site
   and 5 migrated downstream toward the Green River Desolation/ Gray Canyon
   spawning site. Five of 7 Yampa River fish were found at the spawning
   site. The other 2 were found 5-8 km downstream of the site. One of 5
   Green River fish was found at the spawning site, the other 4 between 16
   and 62 km upstream of the site. All fish migrated back to the White
   River by August 1993 and were found near the dam by October 1993. Two
   fish were recaptured and translocated above the dam in September 1993.
   Five fish were located below the dam and 2 above the dam in April 1994.
   By July 1994 seven of the same fish that had migrated toward the Yampa
   River in 1993 were found at the Yampa Canyon spawning site. At the same
   time, 3 of 5 fish that migrated toward the Green River in 1993 were
   found at the Desolation/Gray Canyon spawning site. This included 2 fish
   that had been found upstream of the site in 1993.
   The 12 fish traveled an average of 6 km d(-1) (range: 4-10 km d(-1))
   during the migration period from May through October 1993. Generally,
   fish moved faster to the spawning site than back from the site to the
   White River. These fish moved very little within their home ranges in
   the White River. Six fish tagged in 1992 moved only 0.1-2.3 km in the
   tailwater reach below Taylor Draw Dam from September 1992 through April
   1993. All fish, after their spawning runs, had moved up to or near the
   dam by October 1993. These fish were not tracked again until April 1994.
   Their movement patterns in April 1994 were similar to those observed in
   April 1993. The greatest amount of fish movement in the White River was
   displayed by the 8 fish placed above Taylor Draw Dam in April 1993 and
   the 2 placed in Kenney Reservoir in September 1993. They moved 1.1-40.6
   km in the river before and after their spawning migration in spring and
   autumn 1993.
   These spawning migrations suggest that adult Colorado pikeminnow in the
   White River were recruited from both Green and Yampa river spawning
   populations and were presumably imprinted to these respective spawning
   sites. Those fish placed above Taylor Draw Dam established home ranges
   in habitats previously occupied by Colorado pikeminnow before the dam
   was completed. They remained there until they migrated downstream during
   the spawning period. Although we did not study fish passage, our study
   demonstrates that adult Colorado pikeminnow will use habitat if access
   is provided. Translocation of wild adult fish into historic but
   unoccupied habitats may be a valuable recovery option.}},

   seven creek miles downstream from the release point, with the majority
   of the impacts located within the first creek mile. Factors that
   contributed to the extent and magnitude of the impacts included creek
   morphology, evaporation and diffusion of the liquid gasoline, and
   distance from the release.
   Recovery of the impacted aquatic biological populations appeared to have
   occurred within one month of the release and correlated with a
   concurrent improvement in surface water impacts. Recovery of riparian
   vegetation impacts, apparently caused by direct contact with liquid
   gasoline and gasoline vapors, was evident within three months following
   the release.
   Rapid implementation of a multi-disciplinary site assessment and
   comprehensive monitoring program provided invaluable baseline data which
   identified initial impacts, documented rapid ecosystem recovery, and
   distinguished effects of the release from naturally occurring
   fluctuations in aquatic biological population densities and composition.}},

Abstract = {{The desire of the public to protect free-ranging animals in environments
   that are devoid of natural regulators can lead to overabundance of urban
   wildlife in closed habitats, In some parks and reserves, innovative
   management plans are needed that will include protocols to determine
   when and if artificial methods of population control should be applied
   to free-ranging wildlife as an acceptable alternative to hunting or
   culling. One management option that soon may be available for wildlife
   application is contraception. Information important to the development
   of approved contraception programs includes assessment of reproductive
   characteristics of the targeted species under changing environmental
   conditions as well as assessment of contraceptive efficacy. This
   information will improve the ability to accurately estimate the
   demographic characteristics of animal populations warranting management
   intervention as well as an evaluation of the success of interventions.}},

Title = {{Home-range changes by brushtail possums in response to control}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{117-127}},
Abstract = {{Common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) are intractable pests
   in New Zealand. The effectiveness of local control can be limited by
   immigration, some of which has been attributed to a `vacuum effect'
   directed movements induced by the control itself. To characterise the
   vacuum effect we examined changes in the home ranges of trapped possums
   following control in a 6-ha block at one end of a 13-ha forest patch on
   farmland near Dunedin, New Zealand. We also monitored a sample of
   possums by radio-telemetry. After control, the density was 3 ha(-1)
   inside the removal area and 16 ha(-1) outside. During the year after the
   removal, 29\% of possums within 100 m of the boundary of the removal
   area (n = 38) shifted their range centre at least 50 m towards it. The
   effect diminished rapidly with distance: only 1 of 28 animals moved more
   than 200 m from the boundary. The size of the previous range was a
   significant predictor of movement among males, but this may be partly a
   sampling artifact. We measured a net flux of 69 possums km(-1) across
   the boundary in the 12 months after control, and possums settled on
   average 44 +/- 6.9 m inside the boundary. The vacuum effect in brushtail
   possums appears largely confined to home-range adjustments by
   individuals with ranges overlapping the area of reduced density. This
   limits its potential role in population recovery.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that predation by feral cats and introduced foxes reduces
   population sizes of small, native vertebrates was supported by results
   of a predator-removal experiment at Heirisson Prong, a semi-arid site in
   Western Australia. The methods of control used against cats and foxes to
   protect native mammals reintroduced to Heirisson Prong produced three
   broad `predator zones': a low-cat and low-fox zone, where foxes were
   eradicated and spotlight counts of cats declined after intensive cat
   control; a high-cat and low-fox zone where spotlight counts of cats
   increased three-fold after foxes were controlled; and a zone where
   numbers of cats and foxes were not manipulated. Small mammals and
   reptiles were monitored for one year before and three years after
   predator control began. Captures of small mammals increased in the
   low-cat and low-fox zone, but where only foxes were controlled captures
   of small mammals declined by 80\%. In the absence of cat and fox
   control, captures of small mammals were variable over the sampling
   period, lower than where both cats and foxes were controlled, yet higher
   than where only foxes were controlled. The capture success of reptiles
   did not appear to be related to changes in predator counts. This study
   presents the first experimental evidence from mainland Australia that
   feral cats can have a negative impact on populations of small mammals.}},

Title = {{Trends in the numbers of red kangaroos and emus on either side of the
   South Australian dingo fence: evidence for predator regulation?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Most of Australia's sheep rangelands are enclosed by a dingo-proof
   fence. Within these rangelands, where dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) are
   rare, red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) are considered to be food limited
   because their numbers respond to fluctuations in pasture biomass that
   are driven by highly variable rainfall. Outside this region, where
   dingoes are common, kangaroo densities are generally substantially
   lower, suggesting that dingoes are an important limiting factor.
   However, it is unclear whether dingoes can regulate kangaroo
   populations. In this study, red kangaroo and emu (Dromaius
   novaehollandiae) numbers were monitored for varying periods during
   1978-92 by aerial survey on both sides of the dingo fence in three areas
   in the north of the South Australian pastoral zone. Densities of red
   kangaroos and emus were lower outside the fence, although the disparity
   varied between areas and over time. The similarity in the environments
   on both sides of the fence and the marked step in kangaroo density at
   the fence are consistent with dingoes strongly limiting these prey
   populations. In the north-east of the pastoral zone, where kangaroo and
   emu densities are greatest, the contrast in density across the fence was
   most pronounced. Furthermore, the trends in density over time differed
   across the fence. Outside the fence, red kangaroos and emus remained at
   low densities following drought as dingo numbers increased. Inside the
   fence, red kangaroo and emu populations showed a `typical' post-drought
   recovery. The data therefore suggest that, in some situations, dingoes
   may not simply limit red kangaroo and emu populations, but also regulate
   them. For this to occur, predation rate would need to be density
   dependent at low prey densities. The availability of alternative prey,
   and the reduction in the numbers of all prey during drought may provide
   the mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of road mortality on local populations of wildlife has rarely
   been quantified. In June 1991, the access road into the northern end of
   the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park in Tasmania was widened
   and sealed. This occurred part-way through an ecological study of the
   dasyurid carnivore guild, during which populations were being monitored.
   In 17 months, the resident population of 19 eastern quolls became
   extinct and the devil population, of 39 individuals, halved.
   Concurrently, there was a dramatic increase in the number of road-kills.
   The main causal factor was probably an increase in modal speed of about
   20 km h(-1) and a greater increase in maximum speed. Measures were
   implemented to reduce the incidence of vehicle/wildlife collisions.
   Measures directed at people included physically slowing traffic speed
   (using `slow points') and increasing driver awareness (signs and
   pamphlets). Those directed at wildlife included deterring wildlife from
   crossing the road in the path of approaching vehicles (wildlife
   reflectors), and encouraging escape off the road (ramps across gutters
   and banks, and pipes for shelter). The `slow points' were effective in
   reducing vehicle speeds by 20 km h(-1). Wildlife used the ramps and
   pipes. The eastern quoll population was re-establishing within six
   months, and after two years, had recovered to 50\% of its former level.
   There was some indication that devil populations were recovering.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a large-scale monitoring program linked to the management of
   kangaroos in the South Australian pastoral zone, the western grey
   kangaroo populations have been surveyed annually with fixed-wing
   aircraft over the 15-years-period 1978-92. Western grey kangaroos are
   restricted in their distribution to the southern regions of the pastoral
   zone. During the period of the study, western grey kangaroo numbers
   showed no long-term trends, but did show some marked fluctuations,
   principally in association with a severe drought. Despite this, and
   unlike red kangaroos in the South Australian pastoral zone, no
   consistent, direct association between changes in western grey kangaroo
   numbers and antecedent rainfall could be demonstrated. The postulated
   reason for this is that most of the regional western grey kangaroo
   populations examined in this study were low-density populations at the
   edge of the range of this species. Outside of drought, these populations
   are likely to be limited by factors other than food, such as climate and
   unmodified resources in the form of suitable habitat. Also, because
   boundary populations may well only be maintained by constant loss and
   recolonisation, local extinctions associated with drought may result in
   extended delays in the re-establishment of populations in marginal
   areas. Over the period 1978-92, these populations were harvested
   commercially at annual rates of 5-25\%, which were, on the whole,
   considered to be below the rates suggested to be maximum and
   sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of a baiting campaign against red foxes (Vulpes
   vulpes) was investigated in a rangeland area near Carnarvon, Western
   Australia. An area of 3180 km(2) was aerially baited with dried meat
   baits containing 3 mg 1080 poison (5 baits km(-2)) in August 1995. All
   45 radio-collared foxes monitored in the area were killed by baits. More
   than half the radio-collared foxes died within 3 days of baits being
   laid; the last surviving radio-collared fox died 44 days after baits
   were laid. The overall population reduction was estimated to be >95\%.
   Further implications of this high level of bait uptake are discussed in
   relation to immunocontraceptive control of foxes, as well as for
   population reduction or vaccination of foxes to control rabies.
   Reinvasion of the baited area occurred mainly in autumn, when juvenile
   foxes were dispersing. The relevance of this result is discussed in
   relation to developing more effective baiting strategies. As part of
   another experiment, outer sections of the baited area were periodically
   re-baited as a buffer zone to reduce immigration by foxes into the
   central baited area; the buffer baiting proved to be very effective in
   preventing recolonisation of the entire baited area.}},

Abstract = {{A passive tracking index method that has been successfully applied to
   dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) in Australia was shown to have more general
   applicability to wild canids by monitoring coyote (Canis latrans)
   populations in southern Texas. The index was calculated simultaneously
   for multiple species of animals from observations on the number of
   intrusions onto a series of tracking plots over several days. We found
   that the index reflected changes in coyote activity before and after a
   trapping program on each of 2 ranches. We also were able to
   simultaneously monitor bobcat (Felis rufus) and white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) populations, producing some interesting (and
   unexpected) insights. In our study area, we found it difficult to
   distinguish the number of rabbit and rodent intrusions into the plots,
   but these animals might be indexed in other habitats. Analyses of the
   data as binary responses (presence or absence of spoor on each tracking
   plot), as has been done in scent-post surveys, reduced the sensitivity
   and accuracy of inferences.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing awareness of the ecological impact of domestic cats
   (Felis catus) as wildlife predators has given rise to much effort in
   research on cat control, but studies related to the spread of pathogens
   in natural populations remain almost non-existent. We aimed to determine
   the infection strategy of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) in a
   natural population of cats, focusing on qualitative and quantitative
   aspects of its transmission. FIV is a lethal retrovirus infecting cats
   world-wide, transmitted by bites. It has an interesting potential as a
   control agent for this species. We studied an urban population of stray
   cats over three years, monitoring its epidemiology and its social and
   spatial structures. Despite a high cat density, both transmission rate
   and prevalence of FIV were relatively low. Socially dominant males were
   more likely to be infected. In addition, males of the study population
   were less often infected than in another population, where a polygynous
   mating system involved more fights. Infected individuals lived long
   enough to acquire the virus and infect another cat. Because they were
   subordinates, non-infected cats had a shorter life expectancy, which
   would not have permitted the spread of FIV. Thus, FIV infected
   predominantly at-risk individuals whose social ranking allowed a high
   probability of retransmitting the virus.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality of radio-tagged adult rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) (n =
   274) was monitored for one year in central-western New South Wales. The
   overall mortality rate was 82\%. Predation was the most important and
   consistent cause of adult rabbit mortality, accounting for 44\% of the
   total number of rabbits, followed by Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)
   (16\%), myxomatosis (9\%), unknown causes (9\%), and
   enteritis/peritonitis (2\%). Foxes were the most important predators,
   accounting for 28\% of radio-tagged rabbits. Medium to large birds of
   prey were less important, accounting for 10\%, followed by cats, which
   were responsible for 6\% of the deaths of radio-collared rabbits.
   Myxomatosis outbreaks occurred in February/March and November-January.
   An RHD outbreak occurred during July, with 40\% of the adult rabbit
   population being killed. The number of male and female radio-collared
   adult rabbits killed by each mortality agent throughout the year was
   similar. The proportions of warren-dwelling rabbits and
   surface-dwelling, solitary rabbits killed were similar overall; however,
   a significantly higher number of warren-dwelling rabbits were killed by
   myxomatosis and a significantly higher number of surface-dwelling
   rabbits were killed by RHD.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Sexual dimorphism is analysed in skulls of the culpeo fox, Pseudalopex
   culpaeus, through multivariate and univariate approaches. The species
   shows a moderate level of sexual dimorphism with most cranial variables
   being, on average, 5\% larger in males. Equations are obtained for
   inferring the sex of skulls of juvenile, subadult and adult culpeo
   foxes. The equations are based on a reduced set of variables obtained
   from stepwise discriminant analyses by age class on skull measurements.
   The discriminant power of all functions is estimated on the basis of a
   jack-knife reclassification procedure. Correct classification is higher
   than 85\% for both sexes, and is similar to, or higher than, the values
   reported for other foxes. The use of the discriminant function pooling
   subadult and adult skulls is recommended because it shows a high
   percentage of correct classification without the necessity of ascribing
   a collected skull to the subadult or adult age class before sex
   estimation. The equations provide an easy method to estimate the sex
   ratio of wild populations of this furbearer species using the abundant
   carcasses discarded throughout northwestern Patagonia as a result of the
   intense hunting of the species. The information on sex ratios will help
   in the study of population dynamics and when monitoring the harvest of
   culpeo foxes.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas the epidemiologist studies the distribution and determinants of
   disease and health in a population, the clinical epidemiologist blends
   the diagnostic acumen of clinical medicine with that epidemiological
   analysis and contributes directly to health care delivery. When
   considering the health effects of climate change, not only should the
   geographical distribution of disease be considered as a variable, but
   risk factors must be appreciated as shifting determinants of disease
   within human populations. Trained clinical epidemiologists should be
   able to evaluate the influence of global warming and other aspects of
   climate change upon health. Medical professionals educated in issues of
   clinical epidemiology and climate change are essential for establishing
   baselines for disease predictions and from these for predicting such
   climatic influences in advance of disease outbreaks. Multi-phasic health
   screening of populations with high probabilities of exposure to diseases
   linked to climate change should be conducted to identify sub-populations
   at risk. A typical ``healthorama{''} includes screens for elevations in
   blood pressure, lipids, and glucose, as well as for compromised
   respiratory and cardiovascular functions. For climate-sensitive diseases
   (CSDs) other parameters should be monitored, such as ultraviolet
   sensitivity, allergies, susceptibility to insect-borne diseases, chronic
   pathology of the heart or airways, and behavioral/lifestyle patterns.
   These screenings would be sufficient to identify patients with weakness
   or borderline conditions that could be exacerbated by climate change.
   Also, case findings should be conducted so that when a patient appears
   for treatment of any problem, histories and physical diagnostic surveys
   are done for CSDs. Such clinical screening would establish personal
   health baselines, would protect others who might contact the patient,
   and would be of significance to insurance companies or other economic
   wagers. Periodic screenings also allow early interventions to modify
   lifestyle or behavior that might be adversely affected by climate
   change. Clinical epidemiologists, aware of potential impacts of climate
   change upon the etiology and transmission of disease, are urgently
   needed to intervene for both multi-phasic screenings and case findings
   of patients in order to minimize the development of unnecessary
   climate-sensitive health problems.}},

Abstract = {{A monitoring programme for lakes and running waters is discussed with
   reference to manuals from national and international monitoring
   programmes and the EU research projects AL:PE, AL:PE 2 and MOLAR. For
   lakes, the monitoring programme must include standard test-fishing with
   multimesh sized gillnets, repeated at a frequency determined by the
   population status found in the individual lake. The sampling and
   analyses programme should include tissue samples for determination of
   levels of micro-pollutants such as heavy metals and persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs). Nitrogen isotopes ((14)N/(15)N) should be included to
   determine the trophic level of the individual fish. As micropollutants
   are directly related to the socio-economic aspects and human
   consumption, it is of vital importance to follow standard procedures for
   sampling and analyses. The MOLAR manual is therefore recommended. In
   areas with a significant pollution load, stocking strategies, including
   choice of fish species and strain, should minimize risk for human
   consumption. In rivers and streams in acidified areas, a traditional
   water sample describes the ``at present{''} water quality conditions
   only. In important periods of the year such as the smoltification period
   in Atlantic salmon rivers, a high frequency sampling programme should be
   used. However, by using in situ water chemistry analyses of aluminium
   for species fractionation and molecular size determination in
   combination with ecotoxicological and ecophysiological methods, a much
   better resolution of the past and present water quality can be found.
   This will include sampling of blood for analyses of chloremia and other
   haematological parameters, and gill tissue for histological
   characterisation and determination of Al concentration.}},

Abstract = {{The migratory patterns of an Oscillatoria sp, in a hypersaline microbial
   mat on Antarctica's McMurdo Ice Shelf, 78 degrees S, 166 degrees E, were
   examined under the natural solar irradiance of austral summer. Upward
   and downward migration was monitored in response to different
   intensities of full solar irradiance and of selected wavelengths
   achieved using a series of filter and screening treatments. {[}C-14]
   photoincorporation rates, using freshly collected cell material, were
   also measured under different intensities and spectral regions of solar
   irradiance, as well as at several temperatures of incubation. Our
   objectives were two-fold: (1) to determine whether this cyanobacterium
   displays a pattern of migration, photosynthesis, and photoinhibition in
   response to solar UV and visible irradiance similar to that displayed by
   motile cyanobacteria in hypersaline ponds of middle latitudes (similar
   to 28 degrees N), and (2) to examine the impact of temperature on these
   activities. Oscillatoria sp. migrated completely to the surface under
   low visible irradiance (<8 W m(-2)), green light, and complete darkness;
   none of these treatments included UV-B or more than 0.26 W m(-2) UV-A.
   Red light, which included similar to 0.5 W m(-2) UV-A, promoted a
   partial upward ascent. W-A (6.9 W m(-2) UV-A, similar to 0.1 Wm(-2)
   UV-B), visible irradiance >60 W m(-2) and blue light, which included
   0.94 W m(-2) W-A, caused complete downward migration. Photosynthetic
   saturation occurred at low visible light levels (similar to 26 W m(-2)),
   and both photo- and UV-inhibition was apparent. Photosynthetic rates
   increased in the order 2, <10, <15 and <20 degrees C, and there was no
   apparent effect of temperature on the magnitude of UV inhibition on
   photosynthesis. Overall trends in photosynthesis and migration patterns
   of Oscillatoria sp. parallel those described for benthic cyanobacteria
   of middle latitudes, though the Antarctic species appears to have a
   lower response threshold to visible light and W. These results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that UV radiation is functioning as a
   primary cue for avoidance of damaging solar radiation in the
   Oscillatoria sp. population, and suggests that W is involved in the
   migratory behavior of motile cyanobacteria in microbial mats worldwide.}},

Title = {{Population dynamics of the marine planktonic ciliate Strombidinopsis
   multiauris: its potential to control phytoplankton blooms}},

Abstract = {{The growth, grazing, and cell volume of Strombidinopsis multiauris, a
   large (similar to 100 mu m) coastal planktonic ciliate, is affected by
   food concentration and temperature. Using growth and grazing data, we
   modelled small-scale bloom dynamics between the ciliate and its prey.
   Growth experiments were conducted at 13 degrees C on S, multiauris fed
   the 10 mu m dinoflagellate Gymnodinium simplex; changes in cell numbers
   and cell volume were monitored. Ingestion rate was measured by 3 methods
   (uptake of fluorescently labelled latex beads; heat-killed,
   fluorescently labelled G. simplex; and C-14-labelled G, simplex). Growth
   rate versus food concentration followed a rectangular hyperbolic
   response, with a maximum of mu approximate to 0.6 d(-1) above 10(4) prey
   ml(-1) (480 ng C ml(-1)); below 1.3 x 10(3) ml(-1) (62 ng C ml(-1)),
   mortality occurred. Cell volume followed a rectangular hyperbolic
   response to food concentration, and showed a doubling in size between
   zero and maximum prey levels. Grazing rate initially increased with food
   concentration and was then inhibited at levels >10(4) prey ml(-1). The
   ciliate ingested C-14-labelled live prey at higher rates than either
   dead or artificial prey at subsaturating concentrations; above
   saturating concentrations, ingestion rates were similar for the 3 prey
   types. The maximum observed grazing rate was 35 prey ciliate(-1) h(-1).
   Growth rate and cell volume were measured under steady-state conditions
   at 9 temperatures between 3.5 and 22 degrees C: ciliates died at 3.5 and
   5 degrees C, growth rate increased linearly to a maximum of mu
   approximate to 0.9 d(-1) at 15 degrees C, did not change between 15 and
   20 degrees C, and decreased at 22 degrees C. Cell volume increased
   between 5 and 10 degrees C and decreased between 10 and 22 degrees C.
   The population dynamics model revealed that the ciliate was able to
   control the dinoflagellate population. Over the 20 d model simulation,
   virtually no predator-prey cycle occurred when prey growth rates were mu
   < 0.2 d(-1). As prey growth rate was increased bloom dynamics became
   apparent, with a minimum duration of similar to 10 d for a bloom to
   begin and end at a prey growth rate of mu = 0.65 d(-1) During these
   simulated blooms ciliates reached maximum levels of 35 cells ml(-1), and
   prey reached levels of 1.7 x 10(4) cells ml(-1), similar to numbers
   found in a typical coastal bloom. Our data and model suggest that
   ciliates and their prey produce episodic, short-term blooms, and we
   recommend that these events be evaluated more carefully in the field and
   be incorporated into models.}},

Abstract = {{Field trials utilizing pheromone traps were evaluated to develop a
   population monitoring and predicting system for the European pine sawfly
   (Neodiprion sertifer). Larval density was censused in a transect across
   each study site. Three traps per site were bailed with 100 mu g of
   (2S,3S,7S)-3,7-dimethyl-2-pentadecyl (diprionyl) acetate. During a two-
   year period traps loaded with 1, 10 and 100 mu g of diprionyl acetate
   were compared. Correlations and coefficients of determination between
   numbers of captured males and larvae of the same or successive
   generations were seldom high. Between-generation relationships were
   significant, when population density was increasing. Having years with
   increasing densities in a row, the present monitoring method might
   provide warning of an outbreak. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A long-term monitoring plan was established to study if bird populations
   around Donana National Park were affected by the toxic spill from the
   Aznalcollar mine. The concentrations of Zn, Pb, As, Cu, Sb, Co, Tl and
   Cd in the blood of 11 bird species feeding in the area were determined.
   The parameters which most affect the accumulation of trace elements in
   the birds studied are, firstly, species and, secondly, trophic position,
   sex, days of exposure and weight. In some individuals, Zn and Cu
   occurred at higher levels than the reference values for contaminated
   areas. Concentrations of Pb and Cd in a considerable number of
   individuals were higher than those found in birds from uncontaminated
   areas. The present data, together with the lack of data on blood metal
   concentration prior to the spill, do not offer any conclusive evidence
   of the influence of the spill on avian blood metal concentrations. (C)

Abstract = {{Significant morphological and physiological variations between root vole
   Microtus oeconomus (Pallas, 1776) populations have been found.
   Behavioural differences between two geographically separated populations
   were found in this study. Ultrasonic vocalization and behavioural
   interaction (non-aggressive and aggressive approaches) were monitored
   during 10-min encounters. Ultrasounds were monitored during encounters
   involving all possible combinations of males and females of two
   populations, called here southern (Prague, Czech Republic) and northern
   (Bialowieza, Poland). The northern male-male combination did not produce
   ultrasounds. In both populations, males exhibited more aggressive
   behaviour than females did. Since M. oeconomus females are highly
   territorial and the home ranges of males overlap, the agonistic
   behaviour of males may enable them to control a larger area with greater
   numbers of receptive females. We also found significant differences in
   behavioural activity between the two investigated populations: southern
   M. oeconomus showed higher activity than northern root voles did.
   Separate populations which differ morphologically and behaviourally have
   much to tell us about speciation processes. Behavioural divergence can
   lead to reproductive isolation and thus create separate gene pools.}},

Abstract = {{The fat sand rat Psammomys obesus Cretzschmar, 1828 is an important
   reservoir host for the human disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis. To
   develop a method for monitoring changes in the population density of
   this rodent over large areas, fragments of food, faeces, urine marks,
   and earth mounds at the burrow entrance were evaluated as indicators of
   abundance. The results were compared with population density measured
   simultaneously by trapping. Through the year as a whole, urine maths
   correlate poorly with abundance, but the three other indicators
   correlate well. A correlation coefficient of 0.74 is achieved with food
   fragments and faeces combined. The correlation is best during the wet
   season and poorer in dry conditions. The value of this indirect
   population index is discussed in relation to climatic conditions.
   Details are proposed for the establishment of a monitoring system for P.

Abstract = {{A key challenge for wildlife biologists is to predict how fauna will
   respond to habitat loss. During an ongoing study of habitat use by
   Lumholtz's tree-kangaroos (Dendrolagus lumholtzi), an unexpected
   opportunity arose to study the responses of this rare arboreal marsupial
   to habitat disruption. The study took place on the Atherton Tableland in
   north Queensland: Australia, when half of a 20-ha rainforest fragment
   was unexpectedly clearfelled by the landowner. Prior to clearing, six
   animals had been fitted with radio-collars to monitor their locations
   and activity within the fragment. Most animals responded to clearing by
   remaining in trees until just before they were felled. Animals then fled
   for short distances (mean = 33 m), but returned to their home ranges
   within 12-24 h. Nine additional resident animals were captured after
   forest clearing and radiocollared, and along with the original animals
   were tracked at ca. 12-h intervals for several months. Si?; females and
   five males directly affected by clearing continued to use their original
   home ranges, amongst the 1-2 m-tall tangles of woody debris. Contrary to
   expectations, animals did not relocate to nearby forest blocks, and only
   one animal established a completely new home range. Mortality rates of
   affected animals appeared to increase after clearfelling, with at least
   four perishing from attacks by domestic dogs or dingoes. Although some
   surviving tree-kangaroos lived within the debris for several months,
   their prospects for long-term survival were poor as the debris was
   eventually burnt to create cattle pasture, destroying the already
   modified habitat and leaving them vulnerable to predators. The
   remarkably strong site-tenacity of this species suggests that habitat
   availability will be critically limiting to their populations, and that
   displaced animals will have limited prospects for survival. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{We present information on the current population status of seabirds that
   breed along the Patagonian coast obtained between 1993 and 1995. A total
   of 16 species, including two penguins, one petrel, five cormorants,
   three gulls, three terns and two skuas, breed along the 3,400-km coast
   from southern Buenos Aires (38 degrees 58'S) to Tierra del Fuego (54
   degrees 50'5) Breeding seabirds are not as abundant in coastal Argentina
   as was previously thought. Eleven of the 16 species have less than 5,000
   pairs. The most abundant seabird is the Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus
   magellanicus with 964,000 pairs, an order of magnitude higher than all
   other species. As well as Magellanic Penguins, Kelp Gulls Larus
   dominicanus, and Imperial Cormorants Phalacrocorax atriceps are
   relatively abundant and have a wide distribution. Other seabirds, such
   as Red-legged Cormorants P. gaimardi, Olrog's Gulls L, atlanticus, and
   Dolphin Gulls L. scoresbii, have a highly restricted distribution or
   nest in small colonies at a few sites in Argentina. The Patagonian coast
   is one of the most pristine coastal ecosystems in the world and, thus
   far, few seabirds are seriously threatened. However, oil pollution and
   commercial fisheries are having a negative impact on some seabirds and
   some colonies have shown recent declines. Current threats and impacts,
   including pollution, fisheries, human disturbance, guano harvesting, and
   introduction of alien species are discussed. There are currently 34
   protected coastal areas, although in many cases protection measures are
   not adequately enforced and some areas with high seabird diversity and
   abundance still lack legal and effective protection. Conservation
   actions and requirements, including direct actions, monitoring and
   research are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{A survey was undertaken in 1995 to assess the conservation status of the
   Madeira Laurel Pigeon Columba trocaz, a threatened species endemic to
   the Island of Madeira. The first large scale survey was carried out
   1986, following the cessation of legal hunting of the species, to
   provide a baseline for future monitoring of population changes. The
   current study therefore aims to (I) compare population size with those
   of 1986 and (2) employ distance sampling methods (not used in 1986) to
   obtain estimates of population density and size. Eighteen transects (13
   repeated from the 1986 survey and five new) were conducted in the four
   main areas of laurel forest. Pigeon numbers had increased on nearly all
   transects but some of the highest increases, proportionately and often
   numerically, were in areas with lower numbers in 1986. We estimate the
   current population to be 10,400 individuals, a considerable increase
   since 1986, probably due to a ban on hunting. As laurel forest habitat
   is now very well protected the Madeira Laurel Pigeon is relatively safe
   from extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Calyptrate fly populations were monitored with sticky traps at the
   following sites in Hampshire, UK during August to November 1998: a
   landfill and composting site (Paulsgrove), a site adjacent to this
   landfill (Port Solent), a site with no landfill nearby (Gosport), and a
   composting site with no landfill nearby. Overall, house flies Musca
   domestica (Linnaeus) and lesser house flies Fannia spp. were not
   important constituents of the dipteran catch, while bluebottles
   (Calliphora spp.) and greenbottles (Lucilia spp.) comprised
   approximately 12\% of the total. Very large fly populations were found
   at the two composting sites, and it seems likely that these provide
   ideal breeding grounds for a range of fly species since they offer an
   abundance of warm decaying organic matter. Large fly populations were
   also evident at the landfill site. The suitability of household waste
   for the development of calyptrate Diptera was confirmed in a controlled
   trial: a mean of 0.43 adults emerged per kilo of one-week-old waste.
   Since many hundreds of tonnes of waste are delivered to the landfill
   daily, it is clear that the landfill is likely to substantially increase
   the local population of calyptrate flies. However, the data suggest that
   there was little movement of Diptera from the landfill to Port Solent
   situated approximately 500 m away. The most important calyptrate flies
   at this site were the cluster flies Pollenia rudis (Fabricius) and P.
   amentaria (Scopoli); the landfill site is unlikely to provide a suitable
   breeding site for these flies, as the larvae develop as parasites of
   earthworms. Significantly more flies emerged from one-week-old than from
   two-week-old household waste. A comparison of different barriers to the
   emergence of adult house flies from waste demonstrated that sacking
   provided an effective barrier to fly emergence, but that soil did not
   differ significantly from control treatments. If managed appropriately,
   it seems that the use of sacking over landfill waste could substantially
   reduce associated fly populations.}},

Abstract = {{Existing attempts to estimate the survival rate of tsetse flies from
   ovarian age distributions generally assume that the population is
   stationary. The fact that the survival rate cannot be dissociated from
   the growth rate by these methods poses a problem. Under the assumption
   of a stable age distribution, we propose a maximum likelihood method to
   estimate the `apparent survival rate' for three categories of females:
   nulliparous (beta(0)), young parous (beta(1)) and old parous flies
   (beta(2)). The rate depends both on `real survival rates' a(0), a(1) and
   a(2), and a growth rate lambda: beta(0) = a(0)/lambda, beta(1) =
   a(1)/lambda, and beta(2) = a(2)/lambda. We used a matrix model, which
   can be parameterized if the pupal survival rate and the pupal period are
   known. Replacing a(0), a(1) and a(2) by beta(0),lambda, beta(1)lambda,
   and beta(2)lambda in the projection matrix, the problem amounts to
   calculating its dominant eigen-value lambda, and hence a(0), a(1) and
   a(2). The application to a field population of Glossina palpalis
   gambiensis Vanderplank in Burkina Faso showed there was a marked
   difference in survival rate according to age category. The average
   survival rate increased with age with decreasing variability. The
   results suggested that sampling (by trapping) may have had an effect on
   the dynamics of this tsetse population by ageing it artificially. This
   method may be a useful tool for monitoring tsetse control.}},

Abstract = {{Soymeal (SM) and meat and bone meal (MBM) were incorporated into soil to
   a depth of 15 cm at a rate of 37 t/ha at two commercial potato (Solanum
   tuberosum) fields in Ontario in the spring of 1996. The incidence of
   verticillium wilt and potato scab, the population of plant parasitic
   nematodes, and the soil chemistry and microbiology were monitored in
   three subsequent crops of potatoes in 1996-1998. Verticillium dahliae
   microsclerotia (MS) were buried in the soil immediately after
   incorporation of the amendments, both in the field and in a concurrent
   laboratory assay using soil from the held placed in test tubes, and the
   viability of the MS was determined 4 weeks later. Both treatments
   reduced the incidence of verticillium wilt, potato scab, and the
   nematode population to near zero levels in 1996. Reduced disease levels
   were still evident in the 1997 crop, but by 1998, disease levels were
   equal to or higher than those in the control treatments. Nematode
   numbers remained below control levels for the 3 years of this study.
   Yields were significantly reduced in treated plots in the first year but
   because tubers were scab free, the marketable yield did not differ from
   the control plots. In the second year, total yields were higher in
   treated plots but the increase was significant from the control only
   with MBM at one site. The overall population of soil bacteria increased
   100-fold immediately after the addition of SM and MBM and returned to
   control levels by the end of the first season. There was an initial
   elevation of soil pH from 6.0 to 8.5 at both sites and a corresponding
   increase in ammonia levels 2 weeks after incorporation. Nitrite and
   nitrate levels were also higher than those of the control treatments
   after 4 weeks. SM and MBM reduced MS viability by 72-100\% of the
   control treatments at both sites, which was positively correlated with
   the incidence of verticillium wilt of the crop in the first season (r =
   0.9, P < 0.0001). Thus, the V: dahliae MS bioassay, in conjunction with
   the laboratory assay, predicted the efficacy of these amendments for
   reducing verticillium wilt in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Vicia faba, in a pot experiment with sandy and clayey soils under

   conductivity as well as heavy metal uptake by plants were monitored. At
   rates of five and ten percent (on a dry matter basis) in both soils,
   neither fly ash alone nor cocomposted fly ash exerted any negative
   effect. Plant biomass production was not influenced in either clayey or
   sandy soil. Alkaline fly ash did not promote microbial growth when
   applied alone to the soils. However, cocomposted fly ash generally
   increased bacterial and actinomycetes counts in both soils. Fungi were
   not affected by ash. Due to the increase of soil pH by alkaline fly ash
   or cocomposted fly ash, plant uptake of heavy metals was depressed in
   the sandy soil. Heavy metal mobility did not cause change in the clayey
   soil where a high buffering capacity mitigated the effects of fly ash
   amendments.}},

Abstract = {{As a contribution to Partners in Flight-Canada, the Canadian Wildlife
   Service developed a ranking system to help set priorities for landbird
   species. Two complementary species list were generated; one with scores
   for ``concern{''} representing vulnerability and population trend, and
   one for ``responsibility{''} for regionally characteristic fauna. The
   concern score gave equal weight to vulnerability, a composite score
   based on abundance and breadth of range, and population trend, because
   its purpose was to give early warning of potential problems.
   Responsibility scores were scale-free and were assigned for the season
   in which the species is most abundant. Other systems for identifying
   species of concern may be more appropriate for other jurisdiction or
   organisms, but the responsibility ranking is widely applicable. This
   system is a coarse filter that generated preliminary ranks; additional
   information should be considered in deciding how to allocate scarce
   resources for conservation. Unrefined results are nonetheless useful for
   a variety of purposes, as illustrated by the scores for Canadian
   landbirds. About 25\% of Canada's high-responsibility species are also
   of high concern. These high-concern species are not associated with
   specific habitats or migration patterns. Conservation of species ranking
   high on concern and responsibility merits cooperation with the United
   States and Mexico in particular. The scores identified improved
   monitoring as a priority conservation activity for Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Methodological problems in describing patterns of senescence in wild
   populations have until recently impeded progress in understanding the
   evolution of a process that decreases individual fitness, We
   investigated age- and sex-specific survival in five populations of three
   species of ungulates (roe deer, Capreolus capreolus; bighorn sheep, Ovis
   canadensis; and isard, Rupicapra pyrenaica), using recent statistical
   developments of capture-mark-recapture models and long-term (12 to 22
   yr) data on marked individuals. The yearly survival of females aged 2-7
   yr was remarkably similar and very high (92-95\%) in all five
   populations. Survival of adult males varied among species and
   populations. Survival decreased from 8 yr onward for both sexes in all
   populations, suggesting that senescence was a common phenomenon. Male
   survival was lower than female survival, and the gender difference
   increased with age. The extent of sex differences in survival was
   related neither to sexual dimorphism in mass nor to the level of
   polygyny, suggesting that species differences in social behavior,
   particularly mating system and the level of male-male aggression, may be
   more important than simply the level of polygyny in explaining sexual
   differences in survival. Our results underline the advantages of
   long-term monitoring of marked individuals for the study of evolutionary
   ecology.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of flower visitors to monitor returns when collecting pollen
   from flowers has been seldom studied despite the importance of pollen as
   a food resource, particularly for bees. Californian populations of
   Mimulus guttatus are polymorphic for pollen quality: many plants produce
   a high proportion of cytoplasmless pollen grains that render the grains
   incapable of fertilizing ovules or of supporting bees nutritionally. We
   found that different genotypes maintained a consistent proportion of
   inviable pollen within a genotype and over time. The number of pollen
   grains per flower was also consistent within a plant at each date but
   declined over time. We studied the ability of British bumble bees
   (Bombus spp.) to discriminate among plants of Mimulus guttatus on the
   basis of pollen quality and quantity at three scales: indoors with
   choices of two genotypes, in outdoor plots of several genotypes that
   varied in pollen quality, and outdoors at a whole-patch scale where two
   patches of plants differed in quality.
   We found that bees could discriminate among plants on the basis of
   pollen quality provided that flowers still retained most of the pollen.
   In the two-genotype trials, bees chose genotypes primarily on the
   quantity of viable pollen, and nectar was much less important.
   Similarly, where patches of low- and high-pollen quality plants were
   established, bees responded by visiting the high-quality patch more
   often and by visiting more flowers within the patch. However, the
   results from the outdoor plots that contained genotypes of varying
   phenotypes were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of a large number of
   separate plots showed that the overall correlation between visitation
   rate and pollen quality was significant, but variation among plots was
   also significant. A possible explanation for this inconsistency was
   suggested in a greenhouse trial in which we showed that, when foraging
   density was high, depletion of the standing crop of pollen happened
   quickly, and this reduced the ability of the foragers to choose the
   higher-quality genotypes. The results have implications for the
   evolution of pollen production in Mimulus guttatus and reward production
   in other plants.}},

Abstract = {{The role of density dependence in the population dynamics of tropical
   trees has been a subject of considerable debate. Here, we present data
   on the demography of the edible palm Euterpe edulis, classified into
   seven size categories and monitored over three years. On average, each
   adult palm contributed 98 seedling recruits per year into the
   population. The pattern of mortality was similar to that of other palms,
   with mortality being highest among the smallest plants. Those plants
   with a diameter at soil level >20 mm had an annual mortality <7\%.
   Density dependence was found to act only on the seedling stage of the
   life cycle. The probability of survival and transition of seedlings to
   the next size class were affected both by the density of seedlings and
   the presence of conspecific adults. Matrix modeling indicated that the
   true finite rate of population increase (lambda) was 1.28 and that the
   observed reverse ``J{''}-shaped size distribution of plants was a
   consequence of the density dependence operating in the population.
   Elasticity analysis showed that the survival elements in the matrix
   contributed most to the value of lambda, and that the position of the
   transition matrix in growth-survival-fecundity (G-L-F) space was
   influenced by density. The matrix model incorporating density dependence
   predicted size distributions and densities approximating the maximum
   observed in the field. Spatial simulations indicated that the
   predictions from the matrix model relating to the size structure of
   plants are robust, but that the predictions of densities are sensitive
   to the precise spatial dynamics of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Of the two birds of paradise endemic to the Moluccas, Indonesia, the
   Paradise Crow Lycocorax pyrrhopterus was found to be the sixth and the
   Standardwing Semioptera wallacii the fifth most frequently recorded
   passerine during BirdLife International avifaunal surveys on Halmahera
   Island. Both were found in both primary and logged rain forest at an
   average density of c. 0.4 birds per ha. The Paradise Crow is tolerant of
   mangroves, swamp, and montane areas and human disturbance to forest
   habitat while the Standardwing is less so. Both species are presently
   widespread and common on Halmahera and cannot be considered immediately
   endangered there, but populations on smaller Moluccan islands require
   study and regular monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Wolbachia infection in arthropods may cause incompatibility between
   uninfected females and infected males, but infected females can
   reproduce with both infected and uninfected males, theoretically
   increasing the proportion of infected individuals in a polymorphic
   population. To determine whether the proportion of Wolbachia-infected
   Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) in a
   polymorphic population would increase over time, three populations were
   initiated with 10\% infected and 90\% cured eggs and monitored for 12
   generations. Wolbachia infection did not spread rapidly through the
   populations. Imperfect transmission rates and fitness costs were
   detected that could prevent the rapid spread of this Wolbachia. Thus
   this Wolbachia may not be useful as a drive mechanism for inserting
   useful genes into field populations of M. occidentalis.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal activity of Reticulitermes was observed at 2 sites using ABS
   pipe monitoring stations. At a wildland site, 68 of the monitoring
   stations were occupied by termites during the study; 53, 10, and 5 for
   hydrocarbon phenotypes A, B, and C, respectively. At the residential
   site, 26 monitoring stations were occupied; 14 and 12, for hydrocarbon
   phenotypes A' and D, respectively. Live body weights of workers averaged
   2.28, 1.46, and 1.66 mg for phenotypes A, B, and C, respectively, at the
   wildland site. The workers had similar live body weights at the
   residential site; phenotype D averaged 2.40 mg, slightly more than the
   2.26 mg for phenotype A'. There were no discernible seasonal or monthly
   trends in live body weights. The percentage of the monitoring stations
   occupied ranged from 76.7-89.3\% and 81.2-93.5\% at the wildland and
   residential sites, respectively. The estimated number of termites was
   low in the late fall through the early spring and peaked from June to
   October at the wildland site and peaked from June to November or
   December at the residential site. Wood consumption by Reticulitermes
   followed similar trends at both sites. Wood consumption was minimal
   during the winter, increased slightly in the spring and early summer,
   peaked in the summer and early fall, then declined in the late fall.
   Wood consumption reached 1.1-1.3 g per day per monitoring station at the
   wildland site and 0.8 g per day per monitoring station at the

Abstract = {{The principal epidemiologic evidence that environmental tobacco smoke
   (ETS) increases the risk of lung cancer in (lifelong) nonsmokers is from
   studies of nonsmoking women married to smokers. This article estimates
   exposure-response curves for 14 studies (1,249+ cases, 7 countries) with
   data on lung cancer categorized by the number of cigarettes/day smoked
   by the husband. The pooled results from the five U.S. studies alone are
   extrapolated to ETS levels in the workplace using measures of serum
   cotinine and nicotine samples from personal monitors as markers, of
   exposure to ETS. it is predicted that the increase in lung cancer risk
   for nonsmoking women from average ETS exposure at work (among those
   exposed at work) is on the order of 25\% (95\% confidence interval (CI)
   = 8, 41) relative to background risk (i.e., with no ETS exposure from
   any source). This compares to an estimate of 39\% (95\% CI = 5, 65) for
   nonsmoking women whose husbands smoke at the adult male smoker's average
   of 25 cigarettes/day. At the 95th percentiles of exposure, the estimate
   from spousal smoking is 85\% (95\% CI = 32, 156), compared to 91\% (95\%
   CI = 34, 167) from workplace ETS exposure. Subject to the validity of
   the assumptions required in this approach, the outcome supports the
   conclusion that there is a significant excess risk from occupational
   exposure to ETS, The excess risk from ETS at work is typically lower
   than that from spousal smoking, but may be higher at the 95th
   percentiles of exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Paved road dust present on the surface of streets in Southern California
   consists of a complex mixture of soil dust, deposited motor vehicle
   exhaust particles, tire dust, brake lining wear dust, plant fragments,
   and other biological materials. The research presented here shows that
   allergens from at least 20 different source materials are found in the
   paved road dust. These include pollens and pollen fragments, animal
   dander, and molds. When paved road dust is resuspended into the
   atmosphere by passing vehicle traffic, allergen concentrations in the
   air are increased above the levels that would prevail without the
   vehicle traffic. Using immunological assays that measure the proteins
   extracted from environmental samples that bind to IgE antibodies present
   in the blood serum of allergenic patients, it is possible to measure the
   allergen concentrations present in paved road dust and in airborne
   particle samples. Total protein contributions to monthly average
   airborne TSP and PM10 concentrations are found to be in the range from 1
   to 5.8 mu g m(-3), potentially accounting for a significant fraction of
   the airborne particulate organic material that has not been identified
   to date by GC/MS techniques. Results show that up to 5-12\% of the
   allergenicity of atmospheric total suspended particulate matter samples
   at Long Beach and Rubidoux, CA, is attributable to paved road dust
   emissions. In an industrial area of urban central Los Angeles where
   there is less proximity to vegetation and domestic activities, the paved
   road dust contribution to airborne allergen concentrations is lower,
   accounting for approximately 0.5\% of the total allergenic activity of
   the atmospheric particle samples. In conclusion, paved road dust when
   entrained into the atmosphere by passing traffic is a source of allergen
   exposure for the general population and could be more important in areas
   with more abundant vegetation or with closer proximity of populations to
   major highways than is the case for the Southern California air
   monitoring sites studied here.}},

Abstract = {{Otter trawl surveys are frequently used to assess estuarine fish and
   macroinvertebrate communities. Although these surveys may have similar
   objectives and sampling areas and seasons may overlap, the sampling gear
   is usually unique to the agency conducting the survey. An example of
   this is the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) and
   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program-Estuaries (EMAP) surveys
   in North Carolinian estuaries. We estimated experimentally the
   selectivity and efficiency of the trawls used for these surveys to
   determine the comparability of data used to estimate community structure
   and the abundance of dominant species. The catch percent similarity of
   the trawls was low (12.0\%). The NCDMF net (3.2-m flat otter trawl,
   6.4-mm mesh body, 3.2-mm cod-end, plus tickle chain) precisely (11.7\%)
   and accurately (4.5\%) sampled brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus, density
   but overestimated spot, Leiostomus xanthurus, densities (22.8\%
   accuracy), possibly because these fishes had highly contagious
   distributions. The EMAP net (4.9-m high-rise otter trawl, 38.1-mm mesh
   body and cod-end) was precise (17.9-37.4\%) but inaccurate
   (76.8-97.2\%), probably because of the single large mesh size and the
   lack of a tickler chain. Our study suggests the EMAP and NCDMF surveys
   collect different subsamples of the same fish and macroinvertebrate
   estuarine populations, and therefore could deliver different results and
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Releases of Eretmocerus eremicus Rose and Zolnerawich (Hymenoptera:
   Aphelinidae) at release rates of 3.0-7.5 females per plant per week
   successfully suppressed whitefly populations on commercial poinsettia
   (Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. ex Koltz.) crops in fall of 1996 at four
   Massachusetts commercial producers. At two sites, the whitefly
   populations consisted exclusively of greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes
   vaporariorum (Westwood), and at the other two sites exclusively of
   silverleaf whitefly Bemisia argentifolii Bellows and Perring.
   Parasitoids were received from commercial suppliers and monitored weekly
   to determine the sex ratio of newly emerged adults, as well as the rate
   of adult emergence. Commercially produced pupae were 48.1\% (+/- 2.2 SE)
   female and had 58.1\% (+/- 3.6 SE) emergence under greenhouse
   conditions. Plants from the four biological control greenhouses in this
   trial at the time of sale of the crop had an average of 0.55 (+/- 0.28
   SE) nymphs per leaf Chemically-protected poinsettias offered for sale at
   eight local retail outlets had an average of 0.16 (+/- 0.09 SE) nymphs
   per leaf. Final whitefly densities in both biological control and
   insecticide-treated greenhouses were acceptable to consumers. An average
   of 6.8 insecticide applications was applied to suppress whiteflies in
   chemical control greenhouses in this trial, compared to 1.7 in the
   biological control greenhouses. Use of biological control was 27 fold
   more expensive, costing \$2.14 per plant compared to \$0.08 far chemical
   control. Cost of biological control was inflated by three factors: (1)
   an incorrectly high estimate by one grower of number of plants per
   greenhouse, (2) an unusually long production period (23 weeks) for one
   grower, and (3) miscommunication with the insectary concerning manner of
   filling orders to compensate for reduced percentage of emergence of
   adult parasitoids from ordered parasitized nymphs. Control of these
   cost-inflating factors would allow some reduction in the cost of the use
   of this parasitoid, but not to levels competitive with current
   pesticides. This study is the first to demonstrate the ability off.
   eremicus releases to suppress T. vaporariorum populations in commercial
   poinsettia crops and parasitism of T. vaporariorum by E. eremicus was
   7.5-fold higher (ave. 24.8\% parasitism of fourth instar nymphs in
   pooled seasonal samples) than that observed in B. argentifolii (ave.
   3.3\%).}},

Abstract = {{Swietenia macrophylla King, a timber species native to tropical America,
   is threatened by selective logging and deforestation. To quantify
   genetic diversity within the species and monitor the impact of selective
   logging, populations were sampled across Mesoamerica, from Mexico to
   Panama, and analysed for RAPD DNA variation. Ten decamer primers
   generated 102 polymorphic RAPD bands and pairwise distances were
   calculated between populations according to Nei, then used to construct
   a radial neighbour-joining dendrogram and examine intra- and
   interpopulation variance coefficients, by analysis of molecular
   variation (AMOVA). Populations fi om Mexico clustered closely together
   in the dendrogram and were distinct from the rest of the populations.
   Those from Belize also clustered closely together. Populations from
   Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras, however, did not
   cluster closely by country but were more widely scattered throughout the
   dendrogram. This result was also reflected by an autocorrelation
   analysis of genetic and geographical distance. Genetic diversity
   estimates indicated that 80\% of detected variation was maintained
   within populations and regression analysis demonstrated that logging
   significantly decreased population diversity (P=0.034). This study
   represents one of the most wide-ranging surveys of molecular variation
   within a tropical tree species to date. It offers practical information
   for the future conservation of mahogany and highlights some factors that
   may have influenced the partitioning of genetic diversity in this
   species across Mesoamerica.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to examine movement by the shrimp Paratya
   australiensis between adjacent pools within headwater streams in
   southeast Queensland. Previous work had found fixed allele differences
   between populations from two nearby subcatchments. By translocating
   samples of shrimps between these two populations it was possible to
   monitor movements of the translocated adults and subsequent larvae and
   juveniles over a 12 month period. Overall movement was very limited,
   with juveniles and larvae only moving downstream. Adults, but not
   breeding females, tended to move upstream rather than downstream. These
   results indicating some movement downstream by juveniles and very
   restricted movement upstream by adults, help to explain the genetic
   structure of the species, with fixed differences among populations at
   headwater sites, sometimes even within the same subcatchment.}},

   After impoundment energy demands for costs of living were higher,

Abstract = {{Any form of management adopted for species, ecosystems, or the biosphere
   must: (1) be consistent with management at other levels of biological
   organization; (2) account for reality, including the uncertainty of what
   we do not, or cannot, know, (3) result in living systems within their
   normal ranges of natural variation; (4) exercise precaution and consider
   risk in achieving sustainability; (5) be information-based and
   interdisciplinary: (6) include monitoring and assessment; (7) have clear
   goals and standards of reference; (8) be limited to controlling human
   activities; (9) include humans among the components of ecosystems and
   the biosphere. These nine objectives can be met simultaneously. The form
   of management that does so is described in this paper in its application
   to multi-species fisheries. It also applies in the management of
   fisheries harvesting from single populations, species, ecosystems or the
   biosphere. Such management would be based on empirically observed
   sustainability. In this paper, it is demonstrated how sustainable
   consumption from two groups of species in separate ecosystems is
   exemplified by the predators that feed on them. Such empirical examples
   are the result of a wide variety of factors, including the
   trial-and-error processes of evolution and various risks, including
   extinction, that impose limits. Implications for management are clear.
   Consumption rates by humans have been much too high and would have to be
   reduced significantly to match empirically proven sustainability at its
   maximum. Commercial takes of fish are far above the mean rates of
   consumption observed among predatory species in nature. It will be
   extremely difficult to implement the management that appears to be
   necessary. Nevertheless, consumption rates beyond the naturally observed
   limits have not been proven to sustainably avoid long-term risk. (C)

Abstract = {{Seasonal fattening in preparation for the dry season followed by torpor
   characterizes some members of the family Cheirogaleidae, a group of <
   600g nocturnal Malagasy primates. These behaviors are associated with
   extreme seasonality in dry forests, where most studies have been
   conducted. I aimed to determine if the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus
   rufus), a rain-forest species of cheirogaleid, exhibited similar
   changes. Between January 1993 and May 1994 I conducted a mark-recapture
   study on Microcebus rufus in the rain forest of Ranomafana National
   Park. I monitored body weight and tail circumference for body fat
   fluctuations and inferred changes in activity levels from presence or
   absence in the traps. Some individuals of both sexes increased body fat
   and entered torpor as suggested by their absence from traps for at least
   I month of the dry season. Activity was resumed with body weight reduced
   by 5-35 g, and tail circumference by 0.4-1.2 cm. Population-level
   analysis supports these results; highest weight and tail circumference
   values occurred just before and at the onset of the dry season. Other
   individuals, predominantly male, exhibited no change in body fat or
   activity level, and some mouse lemurs increased their body fat over the
   course of the dry season. Age, social status, and individual response
   may influence seasonal behavioral strategies. Dry and rain-forest
   species of mouse lemur adopt similar behaviors to cope with
   environmental stresses. Mouse lemurs resemble nonprimate, small-bodied
   mammals, in which behavioral changes related to maintaining energy
   balance occur during seasonally unfavorable conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of high temperatures on germination of four Cistus and
   five Halimium taxa is analysed. Seeds were heated to a range of
   temperatures (from 50 degreesC to 150 degreesC) and a range of exposure
   times (from 1 to 60 min), simulating those heat conditions registered on
   the soil surface during wildfires. After the thermal pretreatments,
   seeds were sown in plastic Petri dishes and monitored for germination
   over 60 days. For all the species, germination was increased
   significantly over the control set (untreated seeds) by at least one of
   the thermal pretreatments. Temperatures of 120 and 150 degreesC were the
   most efficient temperatures promoting seed germination, although
   germination was interrupted at 150 degreesC if exposure times were equal
   to or longer than 5 minutes for the majority of species. The preheating
   at 50 degreesC was effective on;y for C. populifolius, but only at long
   exposure times (60 min). H. atriplicifolium had the highest heat
   requirements for stimulating germination, requiring at least 120
   degreesC for 5 min. H. halimifolium subsp. halimifolium seeds showed the
   highest heat resistance: the final germination level reached at 150
   degreesC for 7.5 minutes ranged between 52.5 and 55.5\%. The germination
   rates after preheating were much lower than in mechanically scarified
   seeds, and closely resembled those of the untreated seeds. In general,
   species sharing the same habitat showed different heat requirements in
   promoting germination. For C. crispus and H. halimifolium subsp.
   halimifolium, the experiment was carried out on seeds collected from two
   different localities. For both species the germination patterns were
   similar between populations, although some high temperature
   pretreatments showed different germination percentages.}},

Title = {{Juvenile guanaco survival: management and conservation implications}},

Abstract = {{1. The Chilean National Forestry and Park Service is striving to
   implement a guanaco management programme of sustained-yield use. To
   achieve this, the rate, variation and causes of juvenile guanaco
   mortality must be understood thoroughly. Therefore, we monitored the
   survival of 409 radio-collared juvenile guanacos in Torres del Paine
   National Park, Chile, from 1991 to 1996.
   2. The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator of survival for staggered
   entry was calculated, and survival rates between juvenile males and
   females and among years were compared using the lifetest procedure in
   SAS. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to relate mortality
   rate to explanatory variables such as juvenile sex, birth weight, adult
   female aggression towards researchers during the capture and tagging of
   newborns, population density, and mean monthly winter snowfall.
   3. Mean juvenile survival rate (S) was 0.38, but varied between 0.31 and
   0.55. Survival rates between the sexes were not significantly different,
   although male survival was lower than that of females. Mortality rate
   was highest during the first 14 days after birth. Most deaths occurred
   between birth and 7 months of age.
   4. The risk of mortality increased by almost 6\% with every 1 cm
   increase in winter snowfall, whereas the risk of mortality decreased by
   almost 24\% as adult female aggression increased towards researchers.
   5. Current management objectives are aimed at the implementation of a
   rational harvest of guanacos on the Chilean side of the island of Tierra
   del Fuego. Our results provide improved and updated estimates of
   juvenile guanaco survival and will aid in the modelling of harvest rates
   of guanacos in southern Chile. Future proposed harvests from wild
   populations in southern Chile need to consider the rate and variation of
   this critical life-history parameter.}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of medfly genetic sexing strains (GSS) enables
   only male adults to be produced and released for area-wide control using
   the sterile insect technique (SIT). Before these strains can be
   incorporated into large operational field programmes, information is
   required on all aspects of held performance. In a pilot project in
   -Tunisia, medfly pupae from GSS SEIB-40 {[}based on a pupal colour
   mutation (wp) and VIENNA-43/44 {[}based on a temperature sensitive
   lethal mutation (tsl) were shipped from the FAO/IAEA Agriculture and
   Biotechnology laboratory (Seibersdorf, Austria) and the emerged sterile
   males released weekly from the ground in eases of the Tozeur Governorate
   from mid-February until October 1994. During that period, flies emerging
   from an average of 5000 pupae per hactare were released weekly
   throughout 105 hectares. Transportation problems were encountered which
   resulted in damage to the pupae. Nevertheless, the monitoring of the
   wild population through a trapping network using Jackson and McPhail
   traps showed that both strains performed equally well inducing a three-
   to five-fold decrease of the wild population compared with the control
   oasis (10 wild flies per Jackson trap per day in October in
   Ain-El-Karma, five in Tamerza and 30 in Bir Kastilia control oasis).
   Considering the economical and technical benefits inherent in the use of
   these new strains in the field and as a result of their good field
   performance, similar strains have been introduced into mass-rearing
   facilities in Guatemala (1994), Argentina (1995) and Madeira (1996).}},

Abstract = {{The recent failure of crop rotation to protect corn, Zea mays L., from
   rootworm, Diabrotica spp., larval injury has been extensive throughout
   east-central Illinois and northern Indiana. The widespread and long-term
   use of a corn and soybean, Glycine max L., crop rotation has been
   implicated in the selection of a new strain of western corn rootworm,
   Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, that has expanded its
   oviposition sites to include soybean fields. To understand better how
   western corn rootworm densities fluctuate in corn and soybean fields, we
   deployed Pherocon AM and vial traps in both crops. Also, sweep-net
   samples were taken in soybean fields and an alfalfa field. Twenty sites
   in 7 counties were monitored from late July to early September in 1996
   and 1997. In soybeans across all trapping methods, >90\% of the rootworm
   species collected were western corn rootworm. Counts of western corn
   rootworns and the percentage of females were greater on Pherocon AM and
   vial traps deployed in soybean than in cornfields, Although a greater (P
   < 0.05) percentage of females was collected on Pherocon AM traps
   deployed in a soybean held (73.5 +/- 1.6\%) (mean +/- SE) than in a
   cornfield (42.3 +/- 3.4\%), very few were gravid in either field. We
   suggest that yellow sticky traps may not be attractive to females
   searching for egg-laying sites. We discuss explanations of crop rotation
   failure by comparing our data with historical records of western corn
   rootworms trapped in both corn and soybean fields. Overall trapping data
   indicate that soybean fields are acceptable oviposition sites for
   western corn rootworms in east-central Illinois.}},

Abstract = {{The transfer of animals from the wild into captivity is an important
   strategy for the conservation of species that are under threat of
   extinction. To determine the reproductive capability of animals
   following transfer from the wild, brushtail possums relocated from
   Brisbane, Adelaide, and Armidale into captivity in Brisbane were
   monitored. Seventy five percent of the Brisbane possums (N = 80) gave
   birth during the months from March to May following transfer from the
   suburbs of Brisbane and 75\% of the young born reached weaning. Thirteen
   adult females and four adult male brushtail possums were relocated from
   Adelaide into captivity in Brisbane in June 1994. Four young were born
   in :Brisbane, however none survived to weaning and all the relocated
   possums had died 2 years after their transfer from Adelaide. Seventeen
   adult females and seven adult male possums were transferred from
   Armidale to Brisbane in July 1996. In the first year, 1997, four young
   were born in Brisbane and none survived to weaning. In the second year,
   three young were born and survived to weaning. Two years after their
   transfer, one adult male and three adult females from Armidale and three
   juvenile possums were housed in the Brisbane enclosures. As the
   Brisbane, Adelaide, and Armidale possums received the same photoperiod
   and environmental conditions, some factor must have inhibited breeding
   activity in the Adelaide possums and to a lesser extent in the Armidale
   possums. The ability of the Armidale possums to give birth and wean
   their young after 2 years in Brisbane would suggest that relocated
   possums require up to 2 years in order to adjust sufficiently to their
   new environment to reproduce. However, the failure of the Adelaide
   possums to reproduce successfully after a similar period of time in
   Brisbane suggests that certain environmental differences inhibit the
   ability of different populations of possums to adjust to a new
   environment. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Movements of 60 stream-dwelling wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (97-118
   mm), each tagged with a passive integrated transponder, were monitored
   during Four trials in an enclosed section (24 m long, 45.1 m(2) total
   area) of a stream at a range of densities (four, eight, 16 and 32 fish
   per enclosure). patterns of space use differed markedly between
   individuals, with 80\% of fish establishing home ranges within 8 days of
   introduction to the enclosure (settlers) and the remainder continuing to
   move throughout the length of the enclosure (non-settlers). Although
   aggressive interactions were quite frequent and dominant fish were
   observed chasing subordinates, there was considerable overlap of home
   ranges of settlers at all densities; this was the case even at lower
   densities at which only a fraction of the enclosure was used by the
   fish. Thus, rather than adopting fixed territories, the salmon showed a
   high Level of space sharing. Individual fish used the same local area in
   different ways, ranging from highly localized Feeding on drifting food
   items to a wider-ranging strategy of specialising on benthic food. Among
   the fish that settled absolute growth rates were inversely related to
   body size, and at high densities fish lost weight. These results suggest
   that space use in wild juvenile salmon is more complex than a mosaic of
   territories, that salmon demonstrate significant variability in
   individual space use patterns, and that large fish may suffer
   disproportionately when populations are at the carrying capacity of
   their environment.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we summarize estimates of genetic variation based on
   allozymes for 30 non-social spider species. Overall, these species show
   moderate levels of genetic variability (mean H-o=6.8\%) compared to
   other invertebrate species surveyed for allozymes, although a number of
   spiders possess only minimal variation. Fossorial spiders, especially
   those which are coastal dune dwellers, typically display less variation
   than other non-social arachnids. In general, differences in
   heterozygosity estimates between groups of non-social spiders in this
   article are not confounded by the varying mix of proteins that have been
   assayed by individual investigators. There is a significant positive
   relationship between genetic variability and gene flow (Nm), indicating
   that non-social spider populations which exhibit reduced variability are
   likely to be genetically isolated. Population bottlenecks, directional
   selection and environmental homogeneity have all been cited to account
   for reduced variability in particular non-social spiders. In addition,
   an analysis using the genus Lutica suggests that low genetic variation
   may be accompanied by decreased population fitness. Since the potential
   for evolutionary change is dependent on the existence of genetic
   variability, our findings indicate that a number of non-social spiders
   may be at risk in terms of long-term population viability. This
   conclusion should be verified/extended via a combination of more genetic
   surveys; genetic and ecological monitoring of populations and their
   fitnesses in the wild; and experimental studies of the mechanisms
   underlying fitness differences.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the recruitment and density of adult bay scallops in a Gulf
   Coast of Florida population that had collapsed and not recovered.
   Recruitment and adult stock density were not closely related, and,
   although interannual variations in the levels of both were observed, no
   significant populational responses, including recovery of the
   population, were observed. Such natural stochastic events as toxic algal
   blooms, severe weather, and freshwater discharge, as well as human
   influences, act to depress populations. At low densities, recruitment
   failure because of low fertilization success is likely, and recovery of
   a population may be constrained by depensatory effects when stock
   density in a local population is low. Scallops were distributed
   patchily, and aggregative spawning as well as self fertilization may
   enhance spawning events generated from low adult densities. Natural
   recovery of populations may take a decade or more, and stock enhancement
   efforts may be necessary to restore harvestable stocks more quickly.}},

   5.606 kg/ha (200 International Toxic Units/mg), and methoprene
   (Altosid(TM) ALL) was applied at 213 ml/ha (5\% AI). Efficacy was
   quantified by monitoring the survival of caged and uncaged larval Aedes
   taeniorhynchus. We quantified mortality of sentinel nontarget amphipods
   (Talitridae) at all sites, monitored the effect of temephos on flying
   arthropods using light traps, and collected dead insects in tarps
   suspended under mangroves in areas treated with either temephos or
   methoprene. Each pesticide showed good overall efficacy but occasional
   failures occurred. No detectable mortality of amphipods or Eying insects
   attributable to pesticides was found. The inconsistent field efficacies
   of the pesticides indicate a need for reinspection of treated sites in

Abstract = {{In 1964 a census of all trees > 9.7 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)
   was conducted on 22 plots totalling 13.2 ha in lowland tropical
   evergreen rain forest on Kolombangara, Solomon Islands. Over the
   following 30 yr (1964-1994), populations of all individuals > 4.85 cm
   DBH of the 12 most common tree species and amounts of disturbance have
   been monitored on a declining number of these plots (in 1994, nine plots
   totalling 5.4 ha were still being recorded). Between November 1967 and
   April 1970, Kolombangara was struck by four cyclones, although only two
   of these caused substantial amounts of damage to the canopy structure.
   Multivariate analysis has identified six forest types on Kolombangara
   (Greig-Smith et al. 1967). The species richness and diversity of trees
   in the 1964 census, turnover rates of the populations monitored over
   1964-1975, and the amount of disturbance sustained during a cyclone in
   1970, were arl positively correlated across five of the forest types.
   The sixth forest type was a consistent outlier in these analyses and is
   believed to have been seriously disturbed by humans about a century ago.
   The floristics, turnover and disturbance data support Connell's
   intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The most species-rich forest types
   contained a higher proportion of fast-growing individuals and species
   that are early-successional and which have low density timber.
   Properties of these species rendered them more susceptible to damage
   when struck by the 1970 cyclone. They showed higher turnover rates
   because disturbance-dependent species are also characterised by higher
   mortality and recruitment rates. Thus, periodic cyclones appear to
   favour the maintenance of differences in species diversity and
   composition between forest types.}},

Abstract = {{Pupping seasonality, annual pup production, reproductive rate and sex
   ratio at birth were determined for the Mediterranean monk seal Monachus
   monachus colony at Cabo Blanco, the only surviving population of the
   species which still shows a colony structure. Data were collected by
   means of a monitoring programme that operated continuously in the main
   reproductive areas of the population during the period March 1993-May
   1997. Most (84\%) of the pups observed were born in two caves separated
   by a short distance. Although both caves were used by females to bear
   the pups, preferences greatly fluctuated from season to season with no
   apparent trend. Reproduction occurred throughout the year with a small
   peak of births in October. This unusual lack of seasonality is
   associated with the low latitudinal location of the colony and the
   effect of the upwelling that provides constant food throughout the year.
   The neonatal sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1:1 and the
   estimated annual productivity ranged from 44-58 pups. Taking into
   account population numbers, the annual birth rates were estimated to
   range from 0.3 to 0.43 pups per reproductive female, an extremely low
   rate when compared to other pinniped populations, particularly those of
   a similar size. Such low rates may be either an evolutionary determined
   characteristic of the species or a demographic consequence of the low
   population density over the last few centuries. Coupled with high pup
   mortality rates, this may account for the observed non-recovery of the
   population.}},

Abstract = {{In a laboratory experiment that permitted both observations of the
   behaviour of individuals and the monitoring of small populations, the
   role of `intraguild predation' in the elimination of the freshwater
   amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus by the introduced G. pulex was
   examined. Over 18 weeks, deaths in single and mixed species replicates
   were monitored. Rates of `mortality' (deaths not due to cannibalism or
   predation) did not differ between the species. Gammarus cl. celticus,
   however, was more cannibalistic than G. pulex and, in both species,
   males were more often cannibalized than females. In mixed species
   replicates, the mean proportions of animals preyed upon did not differ
   among replicates with differing starting proportions of the two species,
   nor was there a difference between the sexes in numbers preyed upon. G.
   pulex, however, preyed more frequently on G. d celticus than vice versa,
   and this became more pronounced over time. In 87\% of mixed species
   replicates, G. pulex eliminated G. d. celticus. The results support the
   proposition that intraguild predation may be the primary mechanism
   whereby G. pulex rapidly replaces G. d. celticus in freshwater.
   Integrating behavioural observations with population level monitoring
   may thus link pattern and process in behaviour and ecology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the dynamics of two faunal assemblages colonizing
   high- and low-temperature habitats of the TAG hydrothermal mound on the
   Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Timelapse video and photographic transects were used
   to monitor changes in shrimp and anemone populations from June 1994 to
   March 1995. During this period, holes were drilled in the vicinity of
   the target populations by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP). The a priori
   expectation of a rapid redistribution of motile alvinocaridid shrimp to
   occupy the optimal thermal and chemical habitat in response to changes
   in the pattern of hydrothermal activity was met by the observation of an
   increase in hydrothermal activity and shrimp population density at the
   site where a timelapse video system was deployed. The importance of
   hydrothermal activity as a control on the distribution of vent shrimp is
   suggested by tidal variations in the distribution of shrimp on a
   minidiffuser chimney. Sediment deposition during ODP drilling resulted
   in a temporary disturbance of the shrimp occupying the flat part of the
   mound surface seen by the timelapse video. In contrast to the changes
   observed in shrimp distribution, little change was observed in the
   distribution of anemones across the mound in two photographic transects
   10 months apart, with the exception of a localized disturbance where
   anemones were buried by sediment around an ODP hole. Differences in the
   response of the shrimp and anemones to changes in the hydrothermal
   system may result from differences in their motility and rates of
   biological activity, or reflect a lower trophic position in the case of
   the shrimp.}},

Abstract = {{The first experiments to clearly demonstrate that DNA techniques might
   be used to detect predator-prey interactions between arthropods are
   reported. The accurate modelling of such interactions has depended until
   now upon a mixture of laboratory experiments, population monitoring and
   biochemical tests. The latter involve gut-content analyses, and have
   most recently depended upon the development of prey-specific monoclonal
   antibodies. Although these are excellent for detecting predation on a
   target prey, they are impractical for analysing the prey range of a
   particular predator. Molecular detection depends upon the ability of DNA
   to resist digestion in the predator gut and of the polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) to amplify prey-specific DNA from semidigested material.
   As a first step, experiments using carabid beetles, Pterostichus cupreus
   L, as predators and mosquitoes as prey are reported. The target
   sequences were fully characterized multiple-copy esterase genes from two
   laboratory strains of Culex quinquefasciatus Say. Although DNA was
   extracted from homogenates of whole beetles (minus appendages), a 146 bp
   product could be amplified from both mosquito strains digested in the
   beetle gut for 28 h. The larger, 263 bp product was detectable for 28 h
   in one mosquito strain, but could not be amplified after 5 h from the
   other. Whether the beetles had eaten one mosquito or six, digested for
   zero or 28 h, the prey were equally detectable. Having demonstrated that
   shorter, multiple-copy sequences survive digestion for a considerable
   period in the gut of a predator; the opportunity exists to develop new
   detection systems for studying predation in the held.}},

Abstract = {{A general concern for the conservation of endangered species is the
   maintenance of genetic variation within populations, particularly when
   they become isolated and reduced in size. Estimates of gene now and
   effective population size are therefore important for any conservation
   initiative directed to the long-term persistence of a species in its
   natural habitat. In the present study, 10 microsatellite loci were used
   to assess the level of genetic variability among populations of the
   Komodo dragon Vavanus komodoensis. Effective population size was
   calculated and gene now estimates were compared with palaeogeographic
   data in order to assess the degree of vulnerability of four island
   populations. Rinca and Flores, currently separated by an isthmus of
   about 200 m, retained a high level of genetic diversity and showed a
   high degree of genetic similarity, with gene now values close to one
   migrant per generation. The island of Komodo showed by far the highest
   levels of genetic divergence, and its allelic distinctiveness was
   considered of great importance in the maintenance of genetic variability
   within the species. A lack of distinct alleles and low levels of gene
   flow and genetic variability were found for the small population of Gill
   Motang island, which was identified as vulnerable to stochastic threats.
   Our results are potentially important for both the short- and long-term
   management of the Komodo dragon, and are critical in View of future
   re-introduction or augmentation in areas where the species is now
   extinct or depleted.}},

Abstract = {{A local population of Yellowthroated Sandgrouse was monitored from
   1988-1992 at Northam, Northern Province, South Africa, a region in which
   this species was previously an irruptive. non-breeding visitor.
   Yellowthroated Sandgrouse were found to be veer-round residents,
   foraging and nesting exclusively in areas cleared for agriculture,
   particularly one-year fallow lands. They ate the dry seeds of a variety
   of weedy plants. especially. Amaranthus and Crotalaria spp.. Males
   outnumbered females 1.35:1. Egg-laying occurred from April October. with
   a peak in June. Clutch size (2-3) averaged 2.85 (n=26), and the
   incubation period for one nest was 26 days after clutch completion.
   Nesting success was estimated at 24.8\% (n=19 nests. 176 nest days), and
   the daily nest predation rate at 2.55\%: predation and ploughing
   accounted Tur most nest losses. Average annual productivity was
   estimated to be within the range 0.42-0.85 young/pair/year. We suggest
   that the Yellowthroated Sandgrouse depends on the sleds of early
   successional plants for food and that the recent agricultural
   development of the region maintains sufficient areas of fallow land to
   allow this otherwise nomadic species to become a breeding resident.}},

Abstract = {{Winter abundances of earthworms were monitored in five permanent
   pastures in South Australia for nine years. The earthworm communities in
   these five pastures were dominated by exotic Lumbricidae, mostly
   Aporrectodea species, but indigenous Megascolecidae, e.g. Gemascolex
   species, were also common at some sites. Earthworm abundance and biomass
   varied markedly between sites, years and species, with different
   temporal patterns observed for some species at separate sites. Dominance
   hierarchies varied in time within communities. Major changes in
   earthworm abundance were associated with a particularly wet year.
   Aggregation indices also varied between species. Implications from the
   data for modelling the influence of earthworms on soil properties and
   pasture production and for the use of earthworms as indicators of
   agricultural sustainability are discussed. The study was supplemented
   with data from two extensive regional surveys of earthworm communities

Abstract = {{Aporrectodea caliginosa is the most abundant earthworm inhabiting arable
   and pasture land in New Zealand. The sublethal effects of the
   organophosphate pesticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos on this earthworm
   were measured via the activity of an enzymatic biomarker, cholinesterase
   (ChE). ChE responses were monitored in a series of test systems: from
   laboratory assays, to field mesocosms and natural populations of
   earthworms. In the laboratory, both pesticides elicited an effect on ChE
   in juvenile A. caliginosa at srrbIethaI concentrations, with ChE
   activity being inhibited by greater than or equal to 75\% after I day
   and greater than or equal to 90\% after 7 and 14 days. In the mesocosm
   studies, laboratory-reared juvenile earthworms were caged in lengths of
   plastic pipe, sunk into the ground in an established pasture. The
   pasture was then sprayed with pesticides using conventional farm
   machinery. After 2 and 7 days exposure in the mesocosms, earthworm ChE
   activity was unaffected by the test compounds. In natural populations,
   no differences in biomarker levels were observed in juvenile earthworms
   sampled from pasture sprayed with the organophosphates compared to those
   from control pasture. A survey of earthworms from local farms found no
   relationship between ChE activity and from type. Therefore, although ChE
   was highly responsive to sublethal organophosphate exposures in a
   controlled laboratory situation, the response became less obvious in
   field situations using standard application rates of these two
   pesticides. These results suggest that diazinon and chlorpyrifos applied
   at recommended rates cause no acute effects in A. caliginosa or induce
   physiological stresses as indicated by ChE activity.}},

Abstract = {{Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea longa were inoculated into a
   clay landfill site cap at Calvert, Buckinghamshire during the Spring of
   1992,. Monitoring of these animals, their offspring and natural
   colonists of the site using a variety of methods, has occurred since
   then. Both inoculated species have established sustainable populations,
   with an index of cast-counting showing that A. longa numbers have at
   least doubled. The spread of this species has been steady, but slow
   through the compacted day cap, with worms moving up to 10 m from points
   of inoculation after 5 years (mean value 2.3 m). From digging and
   hand-sorting of samples, A. chlorotica has been shown to move comparable
   distances and earthworm densities overall are now at least 110 m(-2).
   Numbers of A. chlorotica were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in areas
   where both species were inoculated, compared to areas where they were
   inoculated in isolation. Other species found on site include Eiseniella
   tetraedra and Lumbricus rubellus. Although the inoculated earthworm
   populations appear to be expanding and flourishing, physical soil
   conditions have not changed significantly over the study period. The
   rate of amelioration of this type of material would appear to be
   extremely slow and introduction of earthworms can only partially meet
   this requirement.}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Earthworm communities in 7 experimental watersheds at Coshocton, Ohio
   were monitored twice annually (Spring and Autumn) for 5 years (1990-94).
   Sampling by formalin extraction was undertaken along a transect running
   up slope within the small (0.5-0.7 ha) watersheds that were used for row
   crop production under a variety of tillage practices.
   Six earthworm species were found: Aporrectodea turgida, A. trapezoides,
   Lumbricus rubellus, and Octolasion tyrtaeum present in all watersheds,
   plus A. tuberculata and L. terrestris with restricted distributions. In
   individual watersheds, earthworm density was lowest at 3 m(-2) (Autumn
   1991) and highest at 397 m(-2) (Spring 1994), with overall watershed
   averages fluctuating between 55 and 247 m(-2). Tillage practice and crop
   type did not have, a significant effect on earthworm numbers (p > 0.05).
   Equally, position along the transect was not significant for all
   watersheds, however, in some years (e. g. 1991) more worms were found
   towards the slope bottom. This suggested a link with rainfall but no
   significant correlations were found between recorded rainfall and
   earthworm numbers over the 5 year period. Additional sampling during
   Spring 1994 using a combination of formalin extraction and hand-sorting
   revealed that some populations may have been underestimated by 75 \%
   (this difference mainly due to the smaller species), but overall no
   significant differences were recorded (p > 0.05) for biomass or density.
   The presence of deep burrowing species has a marked effect on rainfall
   infiltration. Therefore, attempts were made to establish L. terrestris
   in one watershed where it was previously absent. These proved
   unsuccessful, even though a number of techniques were used. This
   indicated that the distribution of earthworms within this system was not
   simply a factor of colonisation ability.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of temperature, oxygen availability and salinity on seed
   germination in a population of Zostera marina L. from the Fleet, a tidal
   lagoon in southern England, were investigated in the laboratory. The
   fate of seeds under natural conditions was also monitored throughout the
   year from core samples and from seed samples buried in the sediment
   layer in nylon sachets. Supported with temperature, salinity and oxygen
   level measurements at the study site, field data confirmed that
   following seed dispersal in September/October, the majority of seeds
   germinated in the Fleet during the winter and early spring. In the
   laboratory, seeds germinated more rapidly and to a higher final
   percentage under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions.
   Under anaerobic conditions, rapid, near complete germination was
   possible at full salinity (30 g l(-1)) or when the salinity was reduced
   by 50\% (15 g l(-1)). Under aerobic conditions, seeds germinated more
   rapidly at lower salinity. The effects of temperature were strongly
   dependent on the presence or absence of oxygen. Under anaerobic
   conditions, there was a pronounced optimum constant temperature for
   germination around 6 degrees C, corresponding closely to the average
   water temperature recorded during the period mid-October to the end of
   March. On the other hand, under aerobic conditions, very low levels of
   germination were recorded at low temperatures. These findings support
   previously published evidence that seeds of Z. marina are well adapted
   to germinate in anaerobic sediments and that water temperature is the
   key environmental variable that determines the timing of germination
   under natural conditions. Previous misuse of dormancy terms to describe
   seed populations of Z. marina is discussed.}},

   populations was developed and tested on field populations. In the
   bioassay, adult plant bugs were placed into glass vials (20 ml, two
   adults per vial) that had been treated with 15 mu g of permethrin. A
   minimum of 50 adults were tested from each population, and mortality was
   determined after 1.5 to 3.0 h of exposure. Mortality was 95\% at 3.0 h
   of exposure in the susceptible laboratory colony used to develop the
   bioassay, while mortality was 98\% at 3.0 h exposure in a susceptible
   field population. Mortalities less than 10\% were found for a selected
   pyrethroid-resistant laboratory colony used to develop the bioassay and
   also for a field population collected near cotton at Wainwright, LA.
   Field populations were also tested that had mortalities in the
   discriminating-dose bioassay of 30, 48, and 78\%. These were
   pyrethroid-resistant populations with varying numbers of susceptible
   plant bugs in each population. Mortality in the discriminating-dose
   bioassay was directly related to pyrethroid resistance as determined
   with a glass-vial bioassay, and as mortalities in the
   discriminating-dose bioassays declined, the LC,, values for permethrin
   for the plant bug populations increased. In spray chamber tests designed
   to simulate field conditions, three pyrethroid-resistant plant bug
   populations were tested that had mortalities of 9, 64, and 78\% in the
   discriminating-dose bioassay. All three resistant populations had
   significantly lower mortalities when caged on cotton terminals treated
   with permethrin (Pounce) than susceptible plant bugs (92\% mortality in
   the discriminating-dose bioassay). These results indicated that the
   discriminating-dose bioassay could detect pyrethroid-resistant plant bug
   populations, and predict possible control problems from using pyrethroid
   insecticides against resistant populations. The discriminating-dose
   bioassay developed in the study should be very useful to researchers,
   growers, and consultants in detecting plant bug populations with
   pyrethroid resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), continues to be a
   significant pest of cotton worldwide. Two factors essential for
   effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs for pink bollworm
   include: 1) quantification of damage-yield relationships, and economic
   injury levels, and 2) practical sampling plans for estimating pest
   density, or classifying the pest population above or below an economic
   threshold. Research conducted over the past 30 years is reviewed in an
   effort to quantify damage functions, and to assess the advantages and
   disadvantages of several common monitoring methods for pink bollworm.
   Composite results of five independent studies front 1969 to 1991 show
   that yields are not reduced until the average seasonal larval
   infestation in bells approaches 15\%. Each study shows that insecticide
   applications are significantly reduced when economic thresholds (ETs,
   based on moth catches in pheromone traps, or egg or larval infestations
   in bells) are used. Compared with scheduled applications. the average
   reduction in insecticide use, based on ETs, ranged from 23 to 37\% with
   no reduction in yield. Although monitoring adult moth nights with
   pheromone traps continues to be a. popular tool, the recent development
   of binomial (presence-absence) sequential sampling plans for pink
   bollworm eggs offers several advantages. including an indirect indicator
   of female moth activity and earlier detection of subsequent larval
   infestations in bells. Recent commercialization of Bt-cotton,
   genetically transformed to express an insecticidal toxin from the
   bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis. provides considerable promise for
   consistent control of pink bollworm. However, its continued use will
   depend upon rapid development and adoption of resistance management
   plans by growers. Moreover, the use of Bt-cotton is likely to be
   preserved longer if it is implemented within the context of an
   integrated pest management (IPM) program, rather than as a single
   tactic.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, the mountain lion (Puma concolor) is limited to
   the western states and an isolated population in Florida. Recent reports
   suggest that numbers of mountain lions in the west are increasing;
   however, most estimates are based on biased harvest records, mortality
   reports, or sightings. Our purpose was to assess trends in mountain lion
   populations in two ar eas within the Chihuahuan Desert by use of
   multiple-sign surveys. Transects were monitored in spring and fall 1987
   to 1996 in Carlsbad Caverns (CCNP) and Guadalupe Mountains National
   Parks (GMNP). Amount and trpe of mountain lion sign ill each park
   differed and was likely related to the dominant substrate. A decreasing
   trend in mountain lion sign was observed on GMNP from fall 1987 to fall
   1991 and an increasing trend in mountain lion sign was observed from
   Spring 1992 to Spring 1996. No trend was observed on CCNP from fall 1987
   to spring 1996. Mortalities on adjacent lands may hale reduced numbers
   of mountain lions at GMNP. Multiple-sign transects may provide a useful
   tool for monitoring populations of mountain liens in other regions of
   the Southwest.}},

Abstract = {{We explore some of the consequences of harvest on population growth
   rate, age and sex structure in a Norwegian population of red deer Cervus
   elaphus, using age-structured demographic models. Survival rates were
   estimated from individuals marked and monitored annually during
   1977-1995, and information about reproduction patterns were obtained
   from hunting material in the same region. The population had an actual
   doubling time of 14 years, corresponding to a multiplication rate of
   1.051. Harvesting led to a reduction of about 10\% of the potential
   multiplication rate that equalled 1.166. Including stochasticity had
   only a small effect on the population multiplication rate. Due to a high
   hunting pressure, males had less than a 10\% chance of reaching 4.5
   years of age and the male-biased harvest strongly biased the sex ratio.
   Assuming that when the number of females per male increases above a
   given threshold some females would not manage to mate, we investigated
   at which level male harvesting could be maintained without having
   demographic consequences on the population growth rate. We concluded
   that the hunting pressure on males could probably be increased further
   but indirect consequences of a strongly biased sex ratio (e.g. on
   population genetic structure) remain to be studied. Variation in the
   multiplication rate mainly resulted from the variation in winter calf
   survival. In its present form the harvesting regime reduces the growth
   rate and biases the sex and age structure, but does not seem to threaten
   the population's viability and productivity.}},

Abstract = {{In Finland, monitoring of the moose Alces alces population has been
   based on moose sighting cards and on aerial or ground censuses. However,
   considerable criticism has been levelled at these techniques, and there
   is an increasing need for alternative census methods in monitoring and
   managing moose populations. In this study, pellet group counts were
   carried out to determine the density and habitat use of moose in a
   wintering area in central Finland. Pellet group counts were made using
   both strip and plot sampling procedures. Estimates of moose density
   depended significantly on the sampling procedures and on the parameters
   used. Moose density estimates based on plots were twice those based on
   strips. Different plot intervals in plot sampling gave similar results.
   Both sampling procedures gave similar results concerning the habitat use
   of moose. The highest pellet group densities were observed in young
   Scots pine Pinus sylvestris dominated thinning stands where winter food
   availability is considerably high. Because food is a limiting factor in
   winter, pellet group numbers should obviously well reflect moose habitat
   affinity, which can be classified in terms of forest stand
   characteristics. Pellet group counts could possibly be used to estimate
   population densities for moose management. However, it would appear that
   the plot method, which up to now is the widely used method,
   overestimates moose densities. Because of the great variation in the
   results, other possible sources of error in the parameters used should
   also be taken into account in order to improve the accuracy of the
   method to be applied.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical analysis of urine collected from snow for urinary urea nitrogen
   (N):creatinine (C) ratios has received increasing use to determine the
   degree of nutritional restriction of populations of white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) in winter. However, statistically based
   sampling requirements for designing effective field studies or
   monitoring programs have not been described. We calculated power curves
   using urea N:C ratio data from 1,383 urine samples collected from
   white-tailed deer during winter in Maine to predict sample sizes needed
   to detect effect sizes in urea N:C data where variances are expected to
   be low, high, or incapable of being predicted. To detect effect sizes of
   biological significance that may occur in early-mid or mid-late winter,
   or when sample variances are low, approximately 15-20 samples would be
   required per wintering area. However, during late winter or when sample
   variances are great, 20-25 samples would be required. When using a
   chi-square to detect differences between proportions of deer with urea
   N:C values greater than or equal to 3.5 mg/mg, approximately 35 samples
   would be required to detect proportional differences greater than or
   equal to 0.22. Our data suggest that a combination of analysis of
   variance and chi-square analysis is suitable to determine spatial and
   temporal differences in levels of urinary urea N:C collected from
   wintering white-tailed deer.}},

Abstract = {{White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have become overabundant in
   many urban and suburban areas. Residents in these areas often are
   opposed to using lethal methods to control deer populations and insist
   that live-capture and relocation of deer is a viable and humane method
   of control. Therefore, we conducted a controlled experiment in the Sea
   Pines residential area on Hilton Head Island (HHI), South Carolina.
   Nineteen deer were captured with rocket nets, chemically immobilized,
   and marked with radiotransmitter collars. Of these, 10 deer were
   relocated to a forest preserve on the island and 9 were released at
   their capture site as controls. We monitored deer movements over 24-hour
   periods at 1 day, 3 days, 5 weeks, and 10 weeks post-capture and
   compared movement rates and post-release dispersal for relocated versus
   control deer. Mean movement rates (m/hr) did not differ between
   relocated and control deer, or among days post-release. Five of the 10
   relocated deer (50\%) dispersed from their release site, compared to
   none of the controls. We analyzed post-release mortality over 3-month
   and 1-year intervals. Relocated deer experienced greater mortality from
   capture-related causes during the 3-month, post-release interval than
   did control deer (P<0.005, t=31.8, df=17). However, relocated deer
   experienced less mortality from noncapture-related causes during the
   1-year, post-release interval than did control deer (P<0.005, t=49.6,
   df=14). We concluded that live-capture and relocation, even over short
   distances, was not viable because most deer did not remain in their
   relocated area and they suffered greater rates of capture-related
   mortality shortly after relocation than deer that were not relocated.}},

Abstract = {{We examined Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) food
   provisioning rates of nestlings during the 1992 and 1993 breeding
   seasons on the Vernon Ranger District of the Kisatchie National Forest
   in Louisiana. Provisioning rates were monitored at nest trees in
   moderate (9.8 groups/2 km radius, n = 10) and low (5.9 groups/2 km
   radius, n = 10) density populations. Habitat around each cluster was
   measured within three radii (100 m, 400 m, and 800 m) to evaluate the
   possible influence of habitat quality on group density and nestling
   provisioning rates. We tested the null hypothesis that habitat quality
   and provisioning rates would be similar in areas with different
   densities of woodpecker groups. We failed to detect differences in
   nestling provisioning rates between woodpecker groups in moderate versus
   low group densities. Woodpecker groups from areas where group densities
   were moderate attempted to nest significantly more often than woodpecker
   groups occurring in low densities. Hardwood midstory vegetation was more
   abundant in areas with low woodpecker group density. Old-growth pines,
   which are known to be important for cavity excavation, were present in
   habitat around cavity-tree clusters of moderate-density groups, but
   generally absent in areas where group density was low. Woodpecker group
   density may be related to hardwood midstory conditions and the abundance
   and spatial distribution of remnant old pines.}},

Abstract = {{A major ongoing debate in population ecology has surrounded the
   causative factors underlying the abundance of phytophagous insects and
   whether or not these factors limit or regulate herbivore populations.
   However, it is often difficult to identify mortality agents in census
   data, and their distribution and relative importance across large
   spatial scales are rarely understood. Were, we present life tables for
   egg batches and larval cohorts of the processionary caterpillar
   Ochrogaster lunifer Herrich-Schaffer, using intensive local sampling
   combined with extensive regional monitoring to ascertain the relative
   importance of different mortality factors at different localities.
   Extinction of entire cohorts (representing the entire reproductive
   output of one female) at natural localities was high, with 82\% of the
   initial 492 cohorts going extinct. Mortality was highest in the egg and
   early instar stages due to predation from dermestid beetles, and while
   different mortality factors (e.g. hatching failure, egg parasitism and
   failure to establish on the host) were present at many localities,
   dermestid predation, either directly observed or inferred from indirect
   evidence, was the dominant mortality factor at 89\% of localities
   surveyed. Predation was significantly higher in plantations than in
   natural habitats. The second most important mortality factor was
   resource depletion, with 14 cohorts defoliating their hosts. Egg and
   larval parasitism were not major mortality agents. A combination of
   predation and resource depletion consistently accounted for the majority
   of mortality across localities, suggesting that both factors are
   important in limiting population abundance. This evidence shows that O.
   lunifer is not regulated by natural enemies alone, but that resource
   patches (Acacia trees) ultimately, and frequently, act together to limit
   population growth.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic diversity between three farmed and four wild populations of
   Atlantic salmon from Ireland and Norway were analysed using 15
   microsatellite markers. High levels of polymorphism were observed over
   all populations with the average number of alleles and average
   heterozygosity at 17.8 and 0.70, respectively. Farmed salmon showed less
   genetic variability than wild salmon in terms of allelic diversity but
   not necessarily in terms of overall heterozygosity. Between farmed
   populations significant differences were observed in expected
   heterozygosity suggesting that more intensive breeding practices may
   have resulted in a further erosion of genetic variability. Phylogenetic
   analysis using either populations or individuals as nodes show a
   clustering of populations into two groups, farmed and wild. This
   suggests that founder effects and subsequent selection have had more
   effect on the genetic differentiation between these strains than
   geographical separation. This technology has great potential for use in
   aquaculture situation where levels of genetic variation could be
   monitored and inbreeding controlled in a commercial breeding progra. (C)

Abstract = {{South Africa's National Parks Board has opted to control African
   elephants (Loxodonta africana) through culling in the Kruger National
   Park (KNP). Killing elephants is highly controversial. The Board must
   balance this controversy against the probable destruction of vegetation
   and the consequent depletion of biological diversity that high elephant
   densities cause. Annual aerial counts provided the population estimates
   on which the culling quotas were based. For management purposes, the
   elephant population of the Park is divided into four sub-populations.
   From 1984 to 1994, the annual quota was usually taken from only one of
   these sub-populations during a given year. This resulted in 3 to 5 years
   elapsing between culls in each sub-population. We investigated the
   year-to-year changes in densities after culling. These changes were
   density dependent. Density dependence implies that immediate culls
   following estimated high densities may be premature. If left alone, the
   densities would decline naturally. Indeed, culling becomes
   self-reinforcing as it moves population densities towards the level
   where reproduction is greatest. Data confirm this intuition: at
   densities greater than 0.37 elephants/km(2) elephant numbers generally
   declined without culling. Many culls were unnecessary. Culling, as
   implemented in the past, may have had consequences for elephants and
   their habitat that were different to those expected from a mere
   reduction in their numbers. Densities in the year immediately after a
   cull tended to decline - not increase as would be expected from density
   dependence alone. Undoubtedly, this unexpected decline was the
   consequence of disturbance and subsequent emigration. In following
   years, the densities rose as animals moved back into the sub-population.
   A management programme where culling will be instituted only when
   densities exceed 0.37 elephants/km(2) in selected regions in the park
   for at least 1 year, may be more acceptable than the programme used up
   to 1995. However, we do not know if the vegetation of KNP can withstand
   the resulting episodic high densities. With densities presently
   exceeding the cut-off values calculated for both the south and the
   northern management regions vegetation changes there need to be
   monitored.}},

Abstract = {{A review of the literature on seagrass ecology produced over the past
   decade (1989-1997) showed a sustained increase in the scientific
   production in international journals, with a doubling of the annual
   publication rate every four years. This production is highly
   concentrated in Aquatic Botany and three other journals (>50\% of
   papers), involving contributors from 33 countries. Research efforts are
   growing rapidly in W. Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea,
   and Australia. Studies on seagrass ecology also increase in NW America
   and SE Asia. Development of research is particularly strong in themes
   such as disturbance of seagrass meadows, and their growth,
   biogeochemistry and population dynamics. Yet, seagrass ecology is a
   rather imbalanced science, with half of the production produced by
   scientists from only two countries, examining only 10\% of the seagrass
   flora from two biogeographic areas. Seagrass ecology is dominated by
   descriptive research (>60\% of papers), with a paucity of efforts to
   synthesize results and derive general relationships. These
   characteristics result in a present lack of predictive ability, and
   scientific basis for the management of seagrass ecosystems. Coordination
   of research efforts in seagrass ecology has been limited, such that
   great uncertainty arises when scaling up the knowledge produced locally
   to assess seagrass resources at regional and global scales, Seagrass
   ecology must progress from the present descriptive stage to synthesis,
   either through large-scale comparative analyses or: the formulation of
   general models, yielding the power to predict the time course of
   seagrass decline and recovery and the role of seagrass meadows in the
   ecosystem. The development of a cooperative framework should contribute
   to expanding the scale of the research, develop the capacity to conduct
   new relevant research, establish a global network monitoring seagrass
   resources, and incorporate seagrass ecosystems into international
   programs examining the health and functioning of the oceans. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Effective management of estuarine systems that contain submerged aquatic
   macrophytes, requires knowledge of whether macrophyte populations are
   stable, increasing or decreasing in terms of aerial coverage and
   abundance. This study established three transects within Wilson Inlet
   and monitored them five times during 1996 for percent cover of Ruppia
   megacarpa and maximum depth limits of these meadows. Secchi depth data
   collected weekly in the Inlet for water quality monitoring were used for
   comparison.
   Percentage cover of R. megacarpa varied along the length of the
   transects and also between sampling times. This variation was partially
   explainable by variation in light availability, but was affected by
   other factors within the system. Overall sites and times, the maximum
   depth limit of R. megacarpa was at approximately 24\% of incident
   irradience. This value is high in comparison to other submerged
   macrophytes and suggests that R, megacarpa is not limited by light. Its
   distribution may be limited by sediment type, with the seagrass being
   confined to coarser sediments in the Inlet.
   It was concluded that R, megacarpa depth distribution in Wilson Inlet is
   not currently limited by light, and so a minimum acceptable Secchi depth
   cannot be recommended. Repeated measurement of permanent transects for
   percent cover and canopy height, replicated within each meadow and along
   each transect, is recommended. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniysculus) originating from Lake Tahoe,
   California, were introduced into Karisjarvi, a small (11 ha) lake in
   central Finland (61 degrees 58'N, 25 degrees 32`E), in 1968 and 1969.
   Since then, the population has been monitored regularly by trap catches.
   The stocked signals (3-5 years old) were caught until 1973, by which
   time they had reached ages of 7-9 years. Catches have increased slowly
   since the early 1980s, the peak occurring in 1991 at 2.0 individuals per
   trap per night. The population size was estimated as 60 trappable
   specimens in 1974, 95 in 1981 and 320 in 1988. The mean density of adult
   population in suitable biotopes was low, 0.07 specimens per m(-2) or 0.3
   per share metre, in 1988. The slow development of the P. leniusculus
   population has been attributed to environmental factors, mainly the
   limited area of good crayfish habitat. More than 90 \% of all signal
   crayfish were caught in one-third of the shore area, i.e. in steeply
   sloping lake beds suitable for burrowing or rich in shelters such as
   rocks and submerged trees. The signals avoided flat, soft bottoms. Fifty
   per cent of the female P. leniusculus matured at 90 mm TL (smallest 64
   mm), i.e. half of the females entered the breeding population in the
   autunm of their fourth year. The mean size of newly hatched (stage 2)
   juveniles was 9.7 mm TL and of one-summer olds 30.3 mm. The largest
   specimen trapped measured 159 mm. The signal crayfish imported into
   Finland and stocked were infected with crayfish plague (Aphanomyces
   astaci), but no mortality has been recorded. Two Branchiobdellidae
   (Annelida, oligochaeta) epibiont species new to Finland were imported
   from North America with P. leniusculus. The continuous occurrence of
   these commensals in the signal crayfish population indicates that they
   have adapted to Finnish conditions. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A permanent plot of 30 ha (600 x 500 m(2)) was established for long-term
   ecological research on biodiversity and forest functioning in a tropical
   evergreen forest at Varagalaiar, Anamalais, Western Ghats. This paper
   gives the results of the first census of trees in the 30 ha plot. All
   trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh were permanently tagged with
   sequentially numbered aluminium tags and their girth measured. 148 tree
   species (in 120 genera and 49 families) were enumerated in a total
   sample of 13,393 individuals. Species diversity, density and dispersion
   patterns were determined. The mean species richness, density and basal
   area per hectare were 65 species, 446 stems and 36.26 m(2) respectively.
   The Sorensen similarity index for thirty 1-ha subplots varied from 0.7
   to 0.9, indicating the homogeneity in species composition of the stand.
   The pronounced species hierarchy has resulted in the dominance of four
   species that occupy four different forest storeys: Drypetes longifolia
   (lower storey) Reinwardtiodendron anamallayanum (middle storey),
   Poeciloneuron indicum (upper storey) and Dipterocarpus indicus
   (emergent). The forest was dominated by Euphorbiaceae in terms of
   richness (18 species) and abundance of species (3788 stems), and
   Dipterocarpaceae based on the contribution to basal area (18.4\%).
   Species richness and density decreased with increasing girth-class.
   Girth class frequency of the stand exhibited an expanding population of
   trees. Twenty-nine tree species, analysed for spatial dispersion at 1-ha
   scale, exhibited both clumped and uniform patterns, except Vateria
   indica which was randomly distributed in one hectare. Repeat census
   scheduled for subsequent years, will elucidate the behaviour of the
   individual species and the population dynamics of the tree flora and
   will be useful for forest conservation and management. It will also help
   to monitor human activity within this forest.}},

Title = {{Changes in sheep numbers in Britain: implications for bird populations}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-89}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Large increases in sheep numbers occurred in most regions of Britain,
   both upland and lowland, between the mid 1970s and late 1980s, followed
   by a drop or levelling in numbers. In the mid 1990s numbers of sheep
   generally remained far higher than in the mid 1970s. Wales stands out as
   showing an increase throughout the period since 1950 and as a region of
   exceptionally high sheep density. These broad trends conceal much local
   variation. There is concern about the implications for bird populations,
   especially in the Welsh uplands, and the mechanisms are reviewed by
   which the increase in sheep may have affected birds, especially in
   semi-natural upland habitats. Grazing can potentially affect bird
   populations through a large number of mechanisms but principal ones are
   likely to be: (1) loss of preferred vegetation types, (2) alteration of
   food supplies and (3) alteration of predation pressure. The recent
   increases in sheep have almost certainly caused reduction in habitat
   quality for ground-nesting birds such as grouse and waders in some
   regions. However, firm evidence linking declines in upland birds to
   increases in sheep is largely unavailable because (a) there is
   inadequate monitoring of upland birds, (b) habitat-specific information
   on changes in grazing pressure is generally lacking, (c) there has been
   little relevant research on mechanisms, (d) effects of severe grazing
   cannot be readily isolated from other factors such as acidification and
   changes in predation pressure. It is suggested that the apparent
   collapse in Welsh upland bird populations may be a response to this
   recent increase in grazing pressure superimposed on a long-term
   reduction in carrying capacity. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Behavioural and demographic changes in animal populations resulting from
   exploitation are of conservation significance if they affect population
   growth rates. In this study, demography and behaviour of T9 larger
   mammals in conservation areas where legal and illegal hunting occurred
   were compared to that in a fully protected non-hunted area in western
   Tanzania. Results showed that there were few differences in species'
   demography between exploited and unexploited areas, but that, in
   general, mammals were more flighty outside protected areas and that
   these tended to be species that were more heavily exploited.
   Nevertheless, there were few differences in other behaviour patterns
   between the two areas. These findings question the supposition that
   behaviour and demography of mammals necessarily changes in areas of
   exploitation, and that population growth rates or monitoring strategies
   need be affected in anthropogenically disturbed habitats. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Ring-necked Parakeet nests ave inaccessible and the species' breeding
   success has been poorly studied. The reproductive output of feral
   parakeet nests in southeast England was investigated in 1997 and 1998;
   175 nestboxes were sited in known breeding areas and monitored, and
   natural nests at heights of 10 m or lower were examined using a video
   camera and torch. Only one nestbox was occupied by a mature pair and the
   nest failed; the lack of nestbox occupation suggests that nesting
   cavities were not limiting. Twelve natural nests were monitored from
   laying to near fledging: seven in west London and five in southeast
   London. Breeding success was lower than in the native range, at 0.8
   fledglings per nest, due to lower hatching success rather than smaller
   clutch sizes. Mean reproductive output in the larger west London
   subpopulation teas 1.2 fledglings per nest, while in the smaller
   subpopulation the mean was 0.25 fledglings per nest, although the
   difference was not significant. Possible reasons for low breeding
   success are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Four groups of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were collected in
   summer (1992) from four coastal sites of northeast Newfoundland. They
   were held together at seasonally ambient temperature and photoperiod and
   monitored over one winter for variation in a biochemical phenotype,
   antifreeze production capacity. Our results show that population
   differences in antifreeze production capacity reflect the severity of
   overwintering conditions faced. Cod from three bays along the northeast
   coast (49 degrees 30'-47 degrees 30' N) exhibited very similar patterns
   of antifreeze production, suggesting that these environments demand from
   their cod inhabitants approximately the same high level of freeze
   resistance. However, cod from the most exposed northerly site at the tip
   of the Great Northern Peninsula (51 degrees 30' N) developed antifreeze
   levels about 50\% higher than those of the other three groups,
   confirming that the more extreme high-latitude environment demands even
   greater freeze protection for survival. Since 34\% of Great Northern
   Peninsula cod produced antifreeze levels outside the range of all other
   juveniles, we suggest that the physiological distinctness of this
   population has evolved by genetic amplification of antifreeze production
   capacity rather than by selective mortality. The existence of
   physiological population structure should be factored into strategies
   for sustainable fishing of this species in northern waters.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we tested whether prenatal expenditure of resources in
   fallow deer (Dama dama) is affected by the age and reproductive
   experience of mothers. The study was carried out on the wild fallow deer
   population in Doeana National Park in southwestern Spain. Between 1985
   and 1996 a total of 60 different females were monitored by direct
   observation during the fawning season. The exact age of 22 of these
   females was known, and 59 fawns born of these females were captured. The
   mother's age had more influence on the fawn's birth mass than the
   mother's experience did. Fallow deer fawns born of adult multiparous
   mothers (5-8 years old) were heavier than fawns born of young
   multiparous mothers (3-4 years old), whereas birth masses of fawns born
   of primiparous mothers (2-3 years) and young multiparous mothers showed
   no significant difference. Fawns were born earlier in the breeding
   season as the mother's age increased. The trade-off required between
   resources allocated to reproduction and resources available for growth
   and maintenance may limit reproduction and the possibility of increasing
   prenatal expenditure by both young primiparous and young multiparous
   female fallow deer. Sexual dimorphism in birth mass was detected, males
   being heavier than females, independently of the age and parity of the
   mothers. This confirms the finding that fallow deer mothers are selected
   to expend more resources on their male offspring.}},

Abstract = {{During 1995 and 1996 we monitored natural and simulated nests of
   grassland songbirds following removal of duck-nest predators, primarily
   raccoons (Procyon lotor), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and red
   foxes (Vulpes vulpes), in North Dakota, U.S.A. We were unable to detect
   an effect of predator removal on survival of natural (n = 153 nests) or
   simulated (n = 2264 nests) nests of grassland songbirds in either year.
   However, the assemblage of predators destroying simulated nests differed
   between removal and non-removal sites in 1995, when medium-sized
   carnivores and small mammals were the most important predators on
   non-removal sites, whereas ground squirrels were most important on
   removal sites. Our study indicates that grassland songbirds were not
   negatively affected, at least in the short term, by removal of duck nest
   predators. However, changes in the relative importance of predators on
   removal sites in 1995 suggest that smaller predators that were not
   targeted by removal efforts (i.e., ground squirrels) may have caused
   compensatory predation. Long-term studies are necessary to determine if
   the removal of duck-nest predators affects the numerical or functional
   response of predators at a lower trophic level, such as ground squirrels
   and other small mammals.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the effect of the shrimp fishery on Magellanic Penguins
   (Spheniscus magellanicus) in two ways: (1) we determined whether
   penguins were incidentally killed and the magnitude of incidental take,
   and (2) estimated the overlap between penguin diet and fish by-catch of
   the shrimp fishery (total capture excluding shrimp and seabirds). We
   worked with the fishing fleet operating at Golfo San Jorge with onboard
   observers over 200 days in 1995-1997, sampling fishery by-catch and
   entangled birds. Penguins were affected during the austral summer.
   Estimations of mortality rates showed 0.33\% of the breeding population
   at Golfo San Jorge is incidentally killed by the shrimp fishery every
   summer. By-catch in shrimp fishery nets was composed of species
   important as penguin prey (anchovy and hake) in higher proportions
   during summer. The daily by-catch of these species was higher than the
   total calculated daily intake for all penguins breeding in the Golfo San
   Jorge. This could have a significant effect on birds. We recommend that
   an observer program be implemented to monitor seabird mortality and that
   fishing gear should be improved to reduce the indirect effect of the
   fish by-catch on penguins.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the potential functions of old nests in a population of
   Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum) nesting on the Konza Prairie Research
   Natural Area in northeastern Kansas. We determined whether thrashers
   reuse nests constructed in previous years, and tested predictions of the
   hypothesis that old nests function to reduce the risk of nest predation
   by saturating the cues used by search-strategy predators. We also
   manipulated old-nest densities to test the hypothesis that old nests are
   used as indirect cues for nest-site selection. Thrashers were found to
   reuse nests, albeit at low rates (4\% of nests monitored). We found no
   significant relationships between the density of old nests and the
   success of active nests, and experimentally removing nests did not
   influence nest-site selection. These results suggest that old nests may
   only benefit thrashers in this population as a resource to reduce the
   time spent in nest construction.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for predicting the ecological impacts of land use change on
   biodiversity and ecosystem function are needed to guide land planning
   and resource management decisions. This study explores the consequences
   of alternative scenarios of land cover change on the abundance and
   arrangement of potential habitat for a suite of species in the Little
   Tennessee River Basin (LTRB) in the Southern Appalachian Highlands and
   the Hoh River Basin (HORB) on the Olympic Peninsula. We addressed two
   questions: (1) How does land ownership affect the availability of
   suitable habitat for a variety of species in changing landscapes (and
   how do restrictions on forest harvest then change habitat availability)?
   (2) Are species differentially affected by land cover changes that vary
   among landowners?
   Scenarios of land cover change were projected by using a spatially
   explicit model in which the probability of land being converted from one
   cover type to another was conditional upon social, economic, and
   ecological factors. Potential habitat was defined for each species based
   on resource needs related to land cover and topography and was mapped at
   each time step. Spatial pattern of potential suitable habitat for each
   species was analyzed by computing area, number of patches, mean patch
   size, and area of the largest patch of suitable habitat. Simulations
   extended for 100 yr with a 5-yr time step.
   The different scenarios, based on historical periods and management
   options regulating forest loss, produced qualitatively different
   landscapes. Restrictions on forest harvest produced more,
   better-connected habitat for forest species. However, habitat changes
   for species were only partially predicted by changes in land cover
   types. For example, a 5-10\% decrease in the amount of grassy or brushy
   cover in the HORB resulted in a 10-20\% reduction in habitat for
   honeysuckle. When responses of all species were considered collectively,
   there were effects of both private and public ownerships in the LTRB but
   no interaction between the two ownership types. In the HORB, variation
   in the rates of land cover change for public lands had the greatest
   effect on species habitats. Our results suggest that both
   landscape-level approaches, which provide a means to quantify and
   monitor broad-scale changes related to biodiversity and ecosystem
   processes, and species-level approaches, which provide an appropriate
   context for interpreting the significance of landscape-level changes,
   are useful for effective conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of a federally listed endangered plant species, Lomatium
   bradshawii, to the use of fire as a management tool for maintaining
   remnant wetland prairies were evaluated at two public land areas in the
   Willamette Valley of western Oregon. Areas containing L. bradshawii were
   treated with two or three fall season prescribed burns during a
   nine-year period. Foliar crown area, height, umbellets, and schizocarps
   of 150 L. bradshawii at Rose Prairie and 250 at Fisher Butte and the
   recruitment and density of L. bradshawii in 2-m(2) plots at both sites
   were documented during 1988-1996. When both sites were considered
   together, crown area, height, umbellets, and schizocarps per plant
   initially responded positively to burn treatments, but increases were
   not consistent across years or sites. Crown area tended to increase and
   then decline after each burn. Burning initially enhanced schizocarp
   production at both sites; schizocarps declined one or two years after
   burning but remained much higher in the burn treatments than in controls
   until 1996. Seedling production was not correlated with schizocarp
   production at either site. Umbellet and schizocarp production were not
   correlated with January-June temperatures or precipitation at the
   nearest weather station. Burning accentuated differences in size and
   reproductive capacity of L. bradshawii at the two sites and
   differentially affected recruitment and density. Random resampling of L.
   bradshawii in 1997 indicated that effects of repeated burning during the
   previous eight years were hard to detect. At Rose Prairie, foliar crown
   area, height, number of leaves, umbellets, and schizocarps in 1997 were
   similar or lower with burning than in unburned controls. At Fisher
   Butte, L. bradshawii in the two burn treatment were similar to control
   plants, but three burns significantly increased foliar crown area,
   number of leaves, and schizocarps. Monitoring recovery for one or two
   years after a burn may only capture the initial stimulation provided by
   burning and may foster unrealistically high expectations concerning the
   viability of an endangered plant population.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of permanent loss of species or species groups from
   plant communities are poorly understood, although there is increasing
   evidence that individual species effects are important in modifying
   ecosystem properties. We conducted a field experiment in a New Zealand
   perennial grassland ecosystem, creating artificial vegetation gaps and
   imposing manipulation treatments on the reestablishing vegetation.
   Treatments consisted of continual removal of different subsets or
   ``functional groups{''} of the flora. We monitored vegetation and soil
   biotic and chemical properties over a 3-yr period.
   Plant competitive effects were clear: removal of the C-3 grass Lolium
   perenne L. enhanced vegetative cover, biomass, and species richness of
   both the C-4 grass and dicotyledonous weed functional groups and had
   either positive or negative effects on the legume Trifolium repens L.,
   depending on season. Treatments significantly affected total plant cover
   and biomass; in particular, C-4 grass removal reduced total plant
   biomass in summer, because no other species had appropriate phenology.
   Removal of C-4 grasses reduced total root biomass and drastically
   enhanced overall shoot-to-root biomass ratios. Aboveground net primary
   productivity (NPP) was not strongly affected by any treatment,
   indicating strong compensatory effects between different functional
   components of the flora.
   Removing all plants often negatively affected three further trophic
   levels of the decomposer functional food web: microflora,
   microbe-feeding nematodes, and predaceous nematodes. However, as long as
   plants were present, we did not find strong effects of removal
   treatments, NPP, or plant biomass on these trophic groupings, which
   instead were most closely related to spatial variation in soil chemical
   properties across all trophic levels, soil N in particular. Larger
   decomposer organisms, i.e., Collembola and earthworms, were unresponsive
   to any factor other than removal of all plants, which reduced their
   populations. We also considered five functional components of the soil
   biota at finer taxonomic levels: three decomposer components
   (microflora, microbe-feeding nematodes, predaceous nematodes) and two
   herbivore groups (nematodes and arthropods). Taxa within these five
   groups responded to removal treatments, indicating that plant community
   composition has multitrophic effects at higher levels of taxonomic
   resolution. The principal ordination axes summarizing community-level
   data for different trophic groups in the soil food web were related to
   each other in several instances, but the plant ordination axes were only
   significantly related to those of the soil microfloral community. There
   were time lag effects, with ordination axes of soil-associated
   herbivorous arthropods and microbial-feeding nematodes being related to
   ordination axes representing plant community structure at earlier
   measurement dates. Taxonomic diversity of some soil organism groups was
   linked to plant removals or to plant diversity. For herbivorous
   arthropods, removal of C-4 grasses enhanced diversity; there were
   negative correlations between plant and arthropod diversity, presumably
   because of negative influences of C-4 species in the most diverse
   treatments. There was evidence of lag relationships between diversity of
   plants and that of the three decomposer groups, indicating multitrophic
   effects of altering plant diversity.
   Relatively small effects of plant removal on the decomposer food web
   were also apparent in soil processes regulated by this food web.
   Decomposition rates of substrates added to soils showed no relationship
   with treatment, and rates of CO2 evolution from the soil were only
   adversely affected when all plants were removed. Few plant
   functional-group effects on soil nutrient dynamics were identified.
   Although some treatments affected temporal variability (and thus
   stability) of soil biotic properties (particularly CO2 release)
   throughout the experiment, there was no evidence of destabilizing
   effects of plant removals.
   Our data provide evidence that permanent exclusion of plant species from
   the species pool can have important consequences for overall vegetation
   composition in addition to the direct effects of vegetation removal, and
   various potential effects on both the above- and belowground subsystems.
   The nature of many of these effects is driven by which plant species are
   lost from the system, which depends on the various attributes or traits
   of these species.}},

Abstract = {{The river Meuse, located in western Europe, is contaminated by different
   pollutants, of both organic and inorganic nature. The predominant
   sources of Meuse contamination in The Netherlands are agricultural
   activities and pollution derived from urban areas. Crayfish, water, and
   sediment samples were collected at four different locations of the river
   Meuse, in order to cover a large part of the catchment area of this
   river in The Netherlands. Crayfish may be very useful in biomonitoring
   studies, since they can integrate body load by pollutants over time in
   an area-bound manner. In these crayfish, levels of aromatic DNA adducts,
   heavy metal residues, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and
   organochlorine pesticides were determined in hepatopancreatic tissue.
   Also analyzed were water and sediment samples derived from the same
   locations, for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals,
   and organochlorine compounds. In sediments from the four different
   sampling sites, no clear differences were observed in PCB levels.
   Organochlorine pesticide concentrations were highest at location A, the
   most upstream sampling site, whereas a general decrease was observed
   following the river Meuse downstream. A. similar pattern was observed
   for the metal compounds. For PAH sediment levels no consistent tendency
   could be observed. Highest values were detected at site B, followed by,
   respectively, locations A, D, and C. In water samples, a different
   pattern was observed. The highest metal concentration was observed at
   location D, whereas the total organochlorine level was higher at sites B
   and D, compared to the two other sampling sites. Differences in
   pollution levels in crayfish between sampling sites were evident. Site
   D, the most downstream-situated site examined, appeared to be the most
   polluted site with respect to PCBs, DDT, DDE, and Cu in crayfish.
   Moreover, DNA adduct levels, which may serve as a dosimeter for the
   internal dose of aromatic compounds such as PAHs and PCBs, were also
   significantly higher in hepatopancreatic tissue of crayfish captured at
   site D, compared to the three other sampling sites. Moreover,
   significant correlations were observed between DNA adduct levels and the
   lower chlorinated PCB congeners (PCB 28-PCB 101). By correlating the
   different pollutants in water and/or sediment with xenobiotic levels in
   crayfish, no consistency could be observed, indicating that monitoring
   aquatic species may provide specific information on the presence of
   surface water pollutants. These results indicate that crayfish can be
   used as biological indicators of exposure to both organic and inorganic
   pollution in aquatic systems. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The Endangered Species Act calls for the use of the best scientific data
   in conserving threatened or endangered species and the ecosystems upon
   which they depend. The language of this act and other environmental laws
   and relevant judicial rulings also require assessments based on modern
   scientific standards that are routinely applied in ecological research.
   Particularly for the Endangered Species Act, ``take{''} decisions should
   be made only after the supporting documents provide: (1) designation of
   critical habitat based on use and availability methods; (2) risk
   assessment(s) for proposed take and other project impacts; (3) ecosystem
   assessment by trained ecosystem ecologists; (4) a description of an
   adaptive management program involving more than post hoc adjustments to
   problems in mitigation design; (5) a description of the proposed
   scientific monitoring along with thresholds for application of adaptive
   management; (6) uncertainty analysis along with estimates of species'
   abundance and project impacts; (7) nonselective, academic-quality
   referencing of data. methods, and theory supporting the conclusions; and
   (8) reviews of the assessment by independent scientists. These standards
   have been rarely applied to assessments of environmental take, due to
   lack of incentives for cooperation among academic scientists,
   environmental consultants, and the government regulatory agencies.
   Particularly important is requiring the type of independent review used
   by academic scientists. Such review would help ensure that take
   decisions are based on use of the appropriate scientific standards,
   thereby qualifying the supporting data as scientific and the best
   available. no matter how limited the data. Until these standards are
   applied prior to political trade-off and pragmatism, the environmental
   laws will continue to have little bearing on conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The biological implications of sulfide in sediment are poorly understood
   and all too often ignored despite the fact that sulfide can be extremely
   important in determining sediment toxicity to resident biota. Sulfide
   influences sediment toxicity in three major ways, which are reviewed in
   detail: as a toxicant in its own right; by reducing metal toxicity by
   forming insoluble metal sulfide solids and/or by forming metal sulfide
   complexes; and by affecting animal behavior, which in turn can alter the
   toxicity of not just the sulfide but also other sediment contaminants.
   Our present limited understanding of sulfide in sediments represents two
   major problems related to determining the toxicity of sediments. both in
   the laboratory and the field. and the causative agents of such toxicity.
   First, we do not know how important sulfide toxicity is to resident
   populations. Second, by not adequately considering sulfide toxicity, we
   risk underestimating toxicity and misidentifying the causative agents.
   Generic and specific recommendations related to resolving these problems
   are provided, including appropriate measurement and monitoring of
   sulfide in the laboratory and the held, determination of toxicity
   thresholds and tolerances for a wide range of sediment-dwelling
   organisms, further development of toxicity identification evaluation
   procedures, further research into sulfide effects on metal toxicity, and
   determination of the influence of sulfide on bioirrigation.}},

Abstract = {{The horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) is the target of a commercial
   bait fishery that historically has lacked coordinated, coastwide
   monitoring and regulation. Because the catch has increased substantially
   in recent years, agencies have been increasingly pressured to manage the
   fishery more intensively The diversity of interests involved (birders,
   environmentalists, commercial fishers, biomedical companies, coastal
   residents, and the Delaware Bay ecotourism industry) makes management
   especially challenging. In particular, the conflict between
   environmentalists and commercial fishers has been gaining public
   attention. With stronger management, the horseshoe crab population
   likely could meet the basic needs of ail users, including fishers.
   Further delay or avoidance of coordinated, coastwide management
   increases the likelihood of a serious conservation problem that would
   injure the horseshoe crab population as well as various stakeholders and
   the species dependent on it (especially migratory shorebirds). The
   horseshoe crab, which has survived relatively unchanged for the past 350
   million years, now is at the center of a resource tug of war. Regardless
   of our actions, the species is Likely to persist beyond the current
   conflict. However, our desire and ability to manage the population will
   determine to what extent we will be able to meet society's many needs
   for horseshoe crabs.}},

Title = {{Long-term movements of self-marked caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera :
   Sericostomatidae) in a California coastal mountain stream.}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{1. Over 140 000 larvae of the case-building caddisfly Gumaga nigricula
   were self-marked as they incorporated glitter into small. portions of
   their cases while reared in streamside troughs. These marked individuals
   were released into stream pools and their movements monitored in the dry
   season, when base flow was low and no spates occurred, and in the wet
   season when base flow was high and several spates occurred.
   2. Of the 9,000-10 000 larvae released in each of two stream pools in
   the dry season, 4-20\% (i.e. 377-1817 marked individuals) were observed
   on three sampling dates (4, 11 and 24 d after release). Most larvae
   (87-93\%) remained within 4 m up- or downstream of the release line
   after 24 d. No larvae were found outside of the release pools, even
   after 37 d.
   3. Of the > 120 000 larvae released in one stream pool near the
   beginning of the wet season, 408 larvae were recaptured 130-167 d later,
   a period that included 30 days of high flow associated with six spates.
   Estimated survivorship over this period was 0.7-6.2\%; there was no
   relationship between survival and larval size at release. Most (75\%)
   recaptured larvae were found in the pool where they were originally
   released. The remaining larvae were found downstream of the release
   pool. Larvae had generally dispersed only a short distance downstream of
   the release pool (median = 18 m, maximum = 222 m). In addition, four
   marked pupae were later found 436 m downstream of the release pool.
   4. These results illustrate the sedentary nature of larval G. nigricula
   as well as the important role that high flow events play in larval
   mortality and dispersal. These case-building larvae move very little
   during low flow periods, even when food resources appear limiting. In
   contrast, the frequency and distance of larval dispersal are much
   greater during periods with high flow.
   5. Our observations for G. nigricula support previously published
   inferences that larval dispersal within a stream can be limited for some
   aquatic insects. However, our observations also suggest that, even for a
   relatively sedentary species Like G. nigricula, larval dispersal during
   periods with high flow may contribute significantly to gene flow within
   a stream reach.}},

Abstract = {{1. The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Girard), is a North
   American species which was introduced into the Lower Guadalquiviri
   Spain, in 1974. Procambarus clarkii has become a key species since it
   has greatly altered the functioning and structure of the ecosystems it
   has invaded.
   2. Since P. clarkii spawn spontaneously throughout the year, it is to be
   expected that their ecological impact on the ecosystem may vary
   depending of the timing of habitat flooding (e.g. temporary freshwater
   marsh, and temporary or permanent pond). The objective of the present
   study was to understand the reproductive phenology and bioenergetics of
   P, clarkii in Donana National Park, Spain, freshwater ecosystems, and
   consequently, propose some management plans for their populations.
   3. Five stages of ovarian development were detected. Final ovarian
   maturation occurred a few days before spawning and spawning was
   synchronized among mature females of all populations. Egg numbers
   hatched in pleopods ranged from 450 to 550. Timing of juvenile release
   from pleopods varied greatly (10-35 days).
   4. Gravid females support most of their metabolic needs by catabolizing
   carbohydrates (overall mean of O:N = 30.39), and to a lesser extent,
   lipids. The aerobic and excretory metabolisms of gravid females were
   lower than those of immature animals of similar weight.
   5. Analysis suggested that several factors influence the spawning of
   crayfish at the monitored sites. The major factors are water regime and
   temperature. Red swamp crayfish appear to be a spontaneous spawning
   species which may adjust their reproductive cycle to the timing of
   flooding, enhancing the utilization of available resources.
   6. Populations of P. clarkii in Donana National Park could be controlled
   by the management of the water regime and by devising a fishing scheme
   which would maintain an appropriate population structure.}},

Abstract = {{1. The gypsy moth is one of many early spring-feeding Lepidoptera that
   have outbreaks, Previous work has revealed that mortality from natural
   enemies varied between egg hatch dates separated by only a few weeks.
   However, this phenology effect was confounded with density differences
   caused by differential dispersal and early larval survival of the
   releases,
   2. Five different densities of larvae were released at two different
   times in early spring, and monitored for the causes acid amount of
   mortality in the field. We thus sought to separate the effects of timing
   and density on mortality.
   3. Mortality in the larval stages due to parasitoids, disease and
   physiological causes was density-dependent for both release date
   treatments, but the slope of the mortality vs. density line was much
   steeper for the early release. Total mortality over the entire
   generation, which included additionally mortality from predation, was
   density-dependent for the early release but not for the late release.
   4. The timing of egg hatch thus affects fecundity, mortality from
   natural enemies and the form of the relationship between density and
   mortality. These compounding effects may help explain why spring-feeding
   insects are liable to have outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{1. The migratory wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell))
   population of Serengeti has been monitored for 40 years (1958-1998). The
   population increased from 1963 to 1977, stabilized from 1977 to 1993 and
   declined during drought in 1993-94. These changes provided a significant
   contrast in densities and the opportunity to determine the life history
   stages where survival was density dependent and their causes.
   2. There was a delay in age of maturity and a decline of both yearling
   and adult pregnancy rates at higher densities. Changes in yearling
   pregnancy had minimal effect on number of calves born. Adult pregnancy
   rate dropped from 95\% to 88\%
   3. The greatest absolute mortality occurred in newborn calves (0-4
   months old). The most variable survival was in dry-season calf mortality
   (5-11 months old).
   4. Density dependence was clearly present in adult mortality and this
   appeared to be the regulating life stage, Density dependence was also
   found in dry-season calf mortality. The drop in pregnancy rate was only
   weakly density dependent.
   5. The main cause of mortality (75\% of cases) was undernutrition, Bone
   marrow condition showed that more animals died in extremely poor
   condition as the population increased and predators did not cause these
   deaths.
   6. Predation played only a minor role in limiting the wildebeest
   population. Predators caught animals in moderate condition during the
   increase phase and increasingly healthy condition during years of high
   population density. The main predators were lion {[}Panthera leo
   (Linnaeus)] and hyaena (Crocuta crocuta Erxleben).
   7. Adult mortality was significantly negatively related to food per
   capita. This could be viewed either as curvilinear density dependence,
   or as two phases of mortality, The first phase was during population
   increase when mortality was inversely density dependent and may have
   been caused by a constant predation rate. The second was during
   stability and decline and comprised the additive effects of
   undernutrition and predation.
   8. Rainfall in the dry season was the most important extrinsic
   determinant of food supply for the wildebeest population but food was
   related to mortality only when population density was incorporated.
   9. At present the wildebeest population appears regulated by natural
   causes through food supply, Human-caused mortality appears to be a minor
   factor. However, if the number of wildebeest killed by humans increases
   as human population increases, then there could be a permanent decline
   in wildebeest, and a major change in the whole ecosystem, because
   wildebeest are the keystone species. Continued monitoring is essential
   for conservation of the Serengeti ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper first discusses how population exposures to environmental
   pollutants are estimated from environmental monitoring data and the
   problems that are encountered in estimating risk from pollutants on the
   basis of ecologic studies. We then present a technique of estimating
   individualized exposures to an atmospheric pollutant, sulfur dioxide
   (SO2), through atmospheric transport modeling for a case-control study.
   The transport model uses the quantities of SO2 released from 30
   geographically identified industrial facilities and meteorological data
   (wind speed and direction) to predict the downwind ground-level
   concentrations of SO2 at geographically identified residences,
   receptors, of 797 study subjects. A distribution of facility SO2
   emissions, uncertainties in effective stack height, and model
   uncertainty are incorporated to examine the uncertainty in the predicted
   versus ambient monitoring SO2 levels, and to generate an exposure
   uncertainty distribution for both the cases and controls. The transport
   model's accuracy is evaluated by comparing recorded ambient measurements
   of SO2 with the model's predicted SO2 estimates at geographically
   identified ambient monitoring stations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of a continuous mobile monitor and passive
   samplers to estimate the spatial distribution of NO2 in an urban area
   for the purpose of siting a continuous monitor to measure population
   exposure. Monitoring sites were sites selected based on the State and
   Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS) and National Air Monitoring
   Station (NAMS) siting criteria required by the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). SLAMS monitoring objectives define scales
   in which the NO2 concentration and land use are homogeneous. The SLAMS
   scales relevant to NO2 monitoring for NAMS NO2 monitoring sites are
   neighborhood (0.5 to 4 km), and urban (several to 50 km). SLAMS siting
   objectives also define four categories of sites: highest concentration,
   representative concentration, impacts of major sources, and background
   sites. Mobile monitoring with a Scintrex LMA-3 luminal monitor was used
   on a neighborhood scale to measure the NO2 concentration at sites that
   covered a large geographical area. Passive samplers were then located at
   candidate mobile monitoring locations for long-term sampling which
   covered the neighborhood to the urban scale. These two methods
   complement each other by combining short-term continuous measurements
   and integrated long-term measurements which reflect the National Ambient
   Air Quality Standard for NO2 which is based on an annual average. The
   neighborhood site with the highest concentration was not only in the
   area of highest population density, but was also representative of the
   larger urban scale. The magnitude of this urban scale is approximately
   20 km.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that resistance to a pathogenic challenge would
   demonstrate seasonal variations in populations of cotton rats (Sigmodon
   hispidus) and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) using the bacteria
   Listeria monocytogenes in a host-resistance assay. Cotton rats and
   prairie voles were livetrapped in spring, early autumn, and winter from
   spring 1996 to spring 1997. Animals were returned to the laboratory,
   inoculated intraperitoneally with a lethal dose (LD50) of L.
   monocytogenes, and monitored for mortality for 120 h post-challenge. We
   found that resistance to L monocytogenes lacked significant seasonal
   variations in cotton rats and prairie voles, two species with clear
   seasonal rhythms in many individual measures of immunity. Prairie voles
   were more susceptible than cotton rats to L monocytogenes in spring
   1997. Our results indicate that although seasonal variations in selected
   immunological parameters may exist in these species, overall resistance
   to L. monocytogenes varied little across seasons. Because resistance to
   L. monocytogenes involves both innate and adaptive immunological
   responses, it appeared unlikely that seasonal environmental stressors
   were capable of reducing both innate and adaptive responses to a point
   of decreasing resistance to L. monocytogenes.}},

Abstract = {{To monitor the percentage and stability of Ehrlichia
   chaffeensis-infected ticks in southern Indiana over time, pools of
   Amblyomma americanum (L.) ticks were screened for infection in southern
   Indiana for a 2nd time. Nested polymerase chain reaction (with 6\% DMSO
   included only in the 2nd reaction) was performed on 920 ticks in pools
   of 5 individuals from 9 sites (5 sites previously examined and 4 new
   ones) in 6 counties. The average minimum infection rate for all sites
   for 1997 was 4.6\%, lower than that of 4.9\% previously observed for
   1995. However, when only the 5 sites that were positive for infected
   ticks in 1995 were reexamined, the average minimum infection I ate was
   even more disparate (1.4\% in 1997 and 5.1\% in 1995). To correlate the
   presence of infected ticks with the presence of exposed deer, which
   serve as a reservoir, dried blood samples collected from hunter-killed
   deer at 2 locations in southern Indiana were tested for E.
   chaffeensis-reactive antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescent
   assay. Antibodies were detected in 45 and 47\% of 98 samples examined fi
   om the 2 stations. These data provide support to our previous report of
   a population of E. chaffeensis-infected A, americanum in southern
   Indiana and the high proportion of deer previously exposed to E.
   chaffeensis suggests a stable maintenance of E. chaffeensis in this

Abstract = {{Two bivalve molluscs, Tellina tennis and Abra tenuis, apparently
   susceptible to low winter temperatures, were studied on the intertidal
   Balgzand in the western Wadden Sea during a 30-y monitoring programme.
   Both species live in the Wadden Sea on the northern edge of their
   intertidal distribution, and reproduce in mid-summer. By using a l-mm
   mesh sieve, only the individuals of similar to 1 y and older are
   sampled. Both the adult and the juvenile stages of Tellina were
   susceptible to cold winters. In Abra, in contrast, only adults suffered
   from cold winters. The abundance of Tellina in the Wadden Sea showed an
   episodic pattern, with periods of presence of several years alternating
   with relatively long periods of (near) absence. In the Wadden Sea, the
   numbers of Tellina were more variable than in areas with milder winters.
   Collapse of the Wadden Sea populations coincided with severe winters.
   Abra was present in nearly all summers, although in highly variable
   densities. In Abra, but not in Tellina, a positive correlation was found
   between recruitment (at the age of 1) and the summer temperature during
   reproduction. In both species growth was positively correlated with
   temperatures during the main growing season. Abra, with its direct
   larval development into benthic juveniles, has limited possibilities of
   dispersal, and is quite able to maintain more or less stable populations
   in isolated sites in the Wadden Sea. Tellina, in contrast, periodically
   entirely dies out in the Wadden Sea, and recovery of the populations
   originates from offshore North Sea populations. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Using oligonucleotide probes for Eubacteria and four eubacterial
   subgroups, we monitored changes in bacterial community composition (BCC)
   with different degrees of grazing pressure, as follows: unfiltered water
   (UNF, all bacterivores present); <20 mu m (bacteria, heterotrophic
   nanoflagellates {[}HNF], and small ciliates); <5 mu m (bacteria and HNF
   only); and <1 mu m or <0.8 mu m (bacteria only), incubated in dialysis
   bags. Experiments were conducted in the Rimov Reservoir (South Bohemia)
   during the clear-water phase (experiment I), a period of law protistan
   gazing pressure on reservoir bacterioplankton, and during the late
   summer phytoplankton peak (experiment II), a period of high protistan
   grazing pressure. In both experiments, there was a significant shift in
   BCC in the <5 mu m treatments, which came in the form of increased
   proportions of alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria (ALF) and
   Cytophaga/Flavobacterium group (C/F), corresponding with increased
   bacterivory of the ungrazed HNF populations. Changes in BCC in other
   experimental treatments were related to preincubation protistan grazing
   pressure. In experiment I, bacterioplankton were subjected to negligible
   protistan bacterivory in the reservoir and did not shaw a change in BCC
   in the predator-free treatment (<1 mu m), while BCC changed in
   treatments that yielded increases in protistan bacterivory compared with
   that in the ambient reservoir water. In experiment II, a significant
   shift in BCC was induced when bacterioplankton that were subjected to
   heavy predation pressure in the reservoir were transferred into the
   predator-free treatment. Treatments that induced small changes in
   protistan grazing pressure (<20 mu m and UNF in experiment II) did not
   show significant BCC shifts. Proportions of filamentous bacteria (>4 mu
   m) increased in treatments that yielded large increases in bacterivory.
   Filament formation also showed season-specific features; in experiment
   I, all filaments belonged into ALF, whereas in experiment II, most of
   them hybridized with the C/F probe. We conclude that the sudden shifts
   that violate the established balance between bacterial production and
   the protist-induced bacterial mortality led to the significant shifts in

   (Dinophyceae), the causative agent of ciguatera in Tahiti, French

Abstract = {{The benthic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus spp. is the primary causative
   agent of ciguatera fish poisoning in French Polynesia. However, the
   initiation of ciguatera outbreaks and the factors that control
   ciguatoxin production in this dinoflagellate are still poorly
   understood. In this paper, we present some original data concerning the
   seasonal abundance and toxicity of natural populations of Gnmbierdiscus
   spp. based on a long-term survey in a ciguateric site of the island of
   Tahiti. From February 1993 to December 1997, Gambierdiscus spp.
   population densities were monitored weekly in the Atimaono barrier reef
   of Papara in relation to temperature and salinity. Densities peaked at
   4992 cells g(-1) in October 1994 and constituted greater than or equal
   to 1000 cells g(-1) on several occasions. A total of 58 blooms were
   recorded in the area, of which 65\% occurred in 1995 and 1996 alone. Our
   data confirmed the high endemicity of Gambierdiscus spp. in the Papara
   area. Refined analysis of our raw data by a principal-component analysis
   of processes (PCAP) revealed a seasonality in cell densities from
   February 1993 to May 1995. During this period, Gambierdiscus spp.
   populations tended to reach maximum abundance at the beginning and end
   of the hot season. In contrast, salinity did not appear to be a
   determining factor in the seasonal abundance of this dinoflagellate. The
   noticeable increase in both peak densities and frequency of blooms
   further noticed in 1995 and 1996 was preceded by unusually high water
   temperatures in January to April 1994, concomitant with a severe
   coral-bleaching episode. During the course of the study, a total of 303
   x 10(6) cells obtained from 48 successive blooms was harvested. Toxicity
   screening revealed that toxin production was maximum from October 1994
   through December 1996. No correlation was found between toxicity of
   these blooms and their biomass nor the seasonal pattern of temperatures.
   It is suggested that the toxicity of naturally-occurring blooms of
   Gambierdiscus spp. and, consequently, the severity of ciguatera
   incidents in a given area, is mainly dependent on the clonal nature of
   cells which coexist within local populations of this dinoflagellate.}},

Abstract = {{The horizontal and vertical distribution of plant plant parasitic root
   nematodes on banana (Musa AAA cv. Valery) was determined in a sandy clay
   loam in Costa Rica. Root samples were taken from soil blocks at
   distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem,
   from 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants of 120,
   150, 180 or 210 cm high (non-flowering), plus a set from plants at
   flower stalk. The horizontal distance from the pseudostem affected the
   percentage of Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus spp., and total nematodes
   (R. similis + Helicotylenchus spp. + Meloidogyne spp, + Pratylenchus
   spp.). There was a significant effect of soil depth on the density of
   each genus. An Interaction between soil depth and plant height and with
   horizontal distance was found for R. similis and total nematodes. For
   the three horizontal distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of
   each genus decreased with soil depth. Higher percentages of R. similis
   and total nematodes were found at 0 to 30 cm horizontal distance from
   the pseudostem than at greater distances in the upper 30 cm of the soil
   profile. Therefore, samples for monitoring nematode populations in
   bananas should be taken within a horizontal distance of 0 to 30 cm from
   the plant base and down to 30 cm deep from the soil surface. Additional
   studies are needed to relate the nematode population density at this
   sampling point to yield.}},

Abstract = {{The supply of larvae is a major determinant of population and community
   structure in coral reef fishes. However, spatial and temporal variation
   in condition (i.e. quality) of potential recruits, as well as their
   density (i.e. quantity), may influence survival and growth of juveniles.
   We conducted an experiment to test whether recent feeding history could
   affect growth, condition and postrecruitment survival in a Caribbean
   damselfish, Stegastes partitus. Fish were collected soon after
   settlement, and fed either low or high rations in aquaria for 7 days.
   Fish fed the high ration grew faster in aquaria and were in a better
   condition (higher total lipids and Fulton's condition factor) at the end
   of the feeding period. Subsequently, we released 50 fish in 25 pairs
   (one fish subjected to low rations, the other to high rations) on a
   Bahamian coral reef and monitor-ed survival for 10 days. Survivorship of
   high-ration fish was double that of low-ration fish (80 vs 40\% over 10
   days). However, low-ration fish that survived 10 days were of similar
   condition and grew at similar rates to high-ration fish, suggesting that
   shortterm ration differences may not persist: in surviving fish.
   Laboratory experiments showed that low-ration fish were taken by
   piscivorous fishes before high-ration fish, indicating that differential
   predation may account for survival differences. This study highlights
   the potential of feeding history and. condition to affect the
   relationship between patterns of larval arrival at reefs, and subsequent
   juvenile and adult population densities.}},

Abstract = {{For two years, the seed rain and magnitude of seed losses due to
   predation were evaluated in Scots pine forests in southern Spain. The
   Crossbill was the most important pre-dispersal predator, consuming more
   than 80\% of ripening seeds. In addition, other birds, mainly Tits and
   Siskin, also consumed seeds just before seed dispersal, reaching values
   of 16 and 51\% losses in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Seed rain was
   monitored in different microhabitats (under pine canopies, under shrubs
   and in open areas), and was most intense under the canopy of mother
   plants both years. Post-dispersal seed predators (rodents and birds)
   consumed up to 96\% of seeds reaching the ground. Both pre- and
   post-dispersal seed predators preferentially harvested filled seeds.
   Post-dispersal predation was similarly intense in all microhabitats, so
   predators did not change the spatial distribution of the seed rain.
   These high predation rates were constant between years, localities and
   habitats (woodland and treeline). We hypothesize that this high rate of
   seed predation is a major factor limiting the regeneration of these
   relict populations of Scots pine in its southernmost limit.}},

Abstract = {{Ethylene has been implicated as a sex-determining hormone in cucumber:
   its exogenous application increases femaleness, and gynoecious genotypes
   were reported to produce more ethylene. In this study, three full-length
   ACC oxidase cDNAs were isolated from cucumber floral buds. RFLP analysis
   of a population that segregates for the F (femaleness) locus indicated
   that CS-ACO2 is linked to F at a distance of 8.7 cM. Expression of two
   of the genes, CS-ACO2 and CS-ACO3, was monitored in flowers, shoot tips
   and leaves of different sex genotypes. In situ mRNA hybridization
   indicated different patterns of tissue- and stage-specific expression of
   CS-ACO2 and CS-ACO3 in developing flowers. CS-ACO3 expression in
   mid-stage female flowers was localized to the nectaries, pistil and in
   the arrested staminoids, whereas CS-ACO2 transcript levels accumulated
   later and were found in placental tissue, ovary and staminoids. In male
   flowers, petals and nectaries expressed both genes, whereas ACO2
   expression was strong in pollen of mature flowers. In young buds, strong
   expression was observed along developing vascular bundles. Four sex
   genotypes were compared for CS-ACO2 and CS-ACO3 expression in the shoot
   apex and young leaf. FF genotypes had higher transcript levels in leaves
   but lower levels in the shoot apex and in young buds, as compared to ff
   genotypes; the shoot-tip pattern is, therefore, inversely correlated
   with femaleness, and the possibility of a feedback inhibition mechanism
   underlying such correlation is discussed. The two CS-ACO genes studied
   displayed a differential response to ethrel treatment in different
   organs and sex genotypes, further demonstrating the complexity of the
   mechanisms controlling ethylene production during cucumber floral
   development.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the response of northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus
   oregonensis to a sustained removal program in the lower Columbia and
   Snake rivers. We compared catch rates of fish 250 mm fork length and
   larger before and after implementation of removals and examined
   relationships between catch rates and year-class strength. We also
   describe the response of mortality rates, relative weight, growth, and
   fecundity to sustained removals. Although annual exploitation of
   northern pikeminnow at least 250 mm long averaged 12.1\% from 1991 to
   1996, we found no evidence that surviving northern pikeminnow
   compensated for removals. In some areas, catch rates decreased in
   response to removals; however, we found no trend of increased relative
   weight, growth, or fecundity. Estimates of mortality were higher than
   those reported prior to removals, and variations in mortality generally
   corresponded to variations in annual exploitation rates. Our estimates
   of relative weight, growth, and fecundity were similar to estimates made
   prior to northern pikeminnow removals. Continued sustained exploitation
   of northern pikeminnow at 1991-1996 levels will probably not result in
   biological compensation, which increases confidence in the hypothesis
   that sustained removals increase survival of juvenile salmonids
   Oncorhynchus spp. Monitoring of population-level characteristics should
   continue as a parallel component of the removal program.}},

Abstract = {{During the summer of 1991 ozone injury trend plots in Great Smoky
   Mountains National Park, USA, consisting of mature black cherry,
   sassafras and yellow-poplar were established near three ozone monitors,
   ranging in elevation from 597-1265 m. Beginning in mid-August 1991-1993,
   three exposed branches each from the upper- and mid- to lower-crown of
   each tree were collected and evaluated for ozone injury. Of the trees
   examined, 63\%, 52\% and 36\% exhibited some amount of foliar injury in
   1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively. Ozone injury across species was the
   greatest at Cove Mountain in all three years of the study. Overall,
   across sites and years, 11, 12 and 11\% of all leaves examined exhibited
   visible injury for black cherry, sassfras and yellow-poplar,
   respectively. The percentage of injured leaves per branch was greater in
   the mid- to lower-canopy for black cherry, across all sites. Trees for
   each species that exhibited the greatest or least amounts of visible
   injury did so in all three years of the study, indicating a differential
   sensitivity within each species population. No significant ozone
   exposure-tree response relationships were observed with any variable
   tested. These data indicate that ozone concentrations are high enough to
   cause visible symptoms to selected trees within Great Smoky Mountains
   National Park, USA.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of heavy metal and gaseous pollution on genetic make up due
   to selection and mortality was studied in eight European Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations. Genetic structure of these
   populations was evaluated after 13 years of growth at two sites, one
   located in the vicinity of a copper smelter in Glogow (southern Poland)
   and another in a control area (Kornik, central Poland). Based on data
   from 10 enzymatic loci, studied by starch gel electrophoresis, the
   following genetic parameters were characterized: mean number of alleles
   and genotypes per locus, heterozygosity and genotype polymorphism index,
   genetic diversity among sites and genetic similarity according to Nei
   and Roychoudhury. Most of the parameters differed both between sites as
   well as between pairs of populations. Mean multilocus observed
   heterozygosity and genotype polymorphism indices were 8\% and 6\% lower
   respectively at the control site than in the polluted one. Populations
   from the site polluted by heavy metals demonstrate higher genetic
   diversity then those from the control. Genetic similarities showed
   differentiation of particular populations from both locations in
   response to industrial pollution. These results provide evidence that
   the general pattern of adaptation strategy of populations to pollution
   stress is connected with increasing genetic variation. The best
   isoenzymatic markers for monitoring changes in the genetic structure of
   Scots pine populations under the influence of industrial pollution are
   fluorescent esterase (FEST), glutamic-oxaloacetatic transaminase (GOT-A
   and GOT-B), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH-A)
   and shikimate dehydrogenase (ShDH-A) loci.}},

Abstract = {{The biodiversity convention aims at conserving biodiversity and
   guaranteeing fair and sustainable human use of biodiversity. The
   convention further requires that the causes of biodiversity decline are
   identified and evaluated, and that effective conservation and monitoring
   strategies are developed. Resolving these needs requires a different
   approach than those described in the last Global Biodiversity
   Assessment. This assessment tended to be descriptive and did not
   comprehensively attempt to describe future trends in biodiversity in
   relation to the major threats: habitat destruction, overexploitation,
   alien species, pollution and climate change. Integrated assessment
   modelling and scenario development have therefore not been introduced
   and applied to assess changes in biodiversity.
   These tools were originally developed for acidification and
   climate-change impact assessments but are also well suited to analysing
   other environmental problems. The implemented business-as-usual
   scenarios show the causes of biodiversity decline to differ regionally.
   Although complex patterns of causal factors and changes occur in many
   regions, a valid (but generalised) statement is that climate change
   causes biodiversity decline in industrialised regions, while in
   developing regions expanding land use is the major contributor. The
   scenarios further highlight that despite population growth contributing
   to the problem, rapidly increasing consumption patterns, rapid expansion
   of rangelands to support changing diets and too slow-moving
   technological innovations are major attributes of land-use change and
   biodiversity decline. Finally, it is concluded that scenario studies
   transparently highlight the complex systemic interactions and feedback
   between society and the other components of the earth's system. In
   addition, scenarios can contribute well to improving the understanding
   of changes in biodiversity at global and regional levels of assessment.

Abstract = {{Monitoring red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
   populations is a key aspect of wildlife management in Europe, so the
   utilization of resources must be considered. However, the spatial
   distribution of resources used has often been overlooked. We studied
   spatial heterogeneity of winter forest resources used by deer and
   applied an indirect method to evaluate the browsing pressure of these
   cervids in a forest of the Cevennes National Park (Lozere, France). We
   analyzed the pattern of browsing by principal component analysis (PCA)
   and graphical display. We demonstrated that heather (Calluna vulgaris),
   bilberry (Vaccinium sp.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica), which figured in
   more than 50\% of the browsing observed, were unevenly consumed in the
   study area. Moreover, the deer consumed more beech outside high beech
   forest. Our methodology provides a helpful tool to monitor
   browse-ungulate interaction by taking into account the availability of
   key browse resources. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Relative population levels and flight periods of Tomicus piniperda (L.)
   (Col.:Scolytidae) and two of its main predators, Thanasimus formicarius
   (L.) (Col.: Cleridae) and Rhizophagus depressus (F.) (Col.: Monotomidae)
   were monitored in 1995 in eight Scots pine stands in central Sweden
   using flight barrier traps (five per stand) baited with alpha-pinene and
   ethanol. In four of the stands (A-stands) T. piniperda and associated
   species had reproduced the previous year in stumps and slash remaining
   after thinnings conducted in the winter of 1993/1994. In the remaining
   four stands (B-stands) no bark beetle breeding material had been
   available during the five preceding years. In addition, the flight
   periods of the species were monitored in one stand in 1996. In 1995 the
   catches of T. piniperda and R. depressus were four to five times higher
   in the A-stands than in the B-stands, whereas there was no difference in
   the catch of T. formicarius between the two kinds of stands. The T.
   formicarius/T. piniperda ratio was ca. 50 times higher in the B-stands
   compared with the A-stands during the period of clerid predation on
   colonising bark beetle adults and six times higher during the period of
   clerid oviposition. The R. depressus/T. piniperda ratio was only
   slightly higher in the A-strands than in the B-stands as a result of the
   spatial distribution of T. piniperda. Three additional species of bark
   beetle predators were caught: Glischrochilus quadripunctatus (L.),
   Pityophagus ferrugineus (F.) (Col.: Nitidulidae) and Rhizophagus
   ferrugineus (Payk.) (Col.: Monotomidae). Based on their seasonal
   abundance the bark beetle predators can be divided into three temporal
   groups: the first species to occur in the spring is G. quadripuctatus,
   the second group consists of R. depressus and T. formicarius, and the
   last species to initiate flight are R. ferrugineus and P. ferrugineus.

Abstract = {{Managing and understanding the ecology of endemic plants depends upon
   understanding the habitat limitations of these highly restricted
   species. Using transplant experiments we quantified the demographic
   performance of an endangered annual plant of coastal California,
   Chorizanthe pungens Mr. hartwegiana (the Ben Lomond spineflower), in
   habitats with established populations and in nearby habitats where the
   plant is never or rarely found. Habitats used for transplants occur on
   the sandhills soil outcrops to which this species is endemic, including
   open pine forest, manzanita-dominated chaparral and open erosive sand
   habitat. We monitored effects of transplant habitat, site from which the
   transplants originated and intraspecific density on the mortality, final
   biomass and reproductive effort of individual spineflowers. Habitat
   largely influenced biomass and reproductive effort and had little effect
   on mortality. Although spineflowers are currently absent from both pine
   and chaparral habitats, transplants grew and reproduced best under
   pines, and worst under chaparral, with intermediate performance in the
   open areas to which spineflowers are currently restricted. While the
   habitat needs of spineflowers impose severe restrictions on their
   population size, management could enhance establishment in
   pine-dominated areas adjacent to current populations. Patterns of
   spineflower;er performance suggest that endemic plants may be excluded
   from potential habitats by a multiplicity of factors, complicating
   management for the viability of such species.}},

Abstract = {{I monitored 382 red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) nests in
   natural (wetlands and tallgrass prairie) and human-disturbed (hayfields,
   roadside ditches) habitats in the vicinity of Boulder, Colorado during
   1996 and 1997. I counted blackbirds in a total of 6216 ha and quantified
   habitat composition to determine both within-habitat population density
   and regional habitat availability. Population density mirrored
   habitat-specific productivity of red-winged blackbirds in habitats that
   had predictable sources of water (wetlands, roadside ditches). However,
   population density and habitat-specific productivity were decoupled in
   habitats that were unpredictable in the amount of water present during
   territory establishment (tallgrass prairie and hayfields, which were
   flood irrigated). Regional habitat productivity was estimated using data
   on habitat-specific productivity habitat-specific population density and
   regional habitat availability. Red-winged blackbirds breeding in
   wetlands in the absence of yellow-headed blackbirds (Xanthocephalus
   xanthocephalus) contributed the most young to the regional population,
   whereas birds breeding in human-disturbed habitats (hayfields and
   roadside ditches) contributed relatively few young to the regional
   population. Due to the scarcity of high quality patches in the landscape
   (e.g., tallgrass prairie),the highest quality habitats did not always
   contribute the most young to the regional population.}},

Abstract = {{We present a dynamic model of the evolution of host resistance to avian
   brood parasites, when the latter can retaliate against hosts that reject
   parasitic eggs. In a verbal model, Zahavi (1979, American Naturalist,
   113, 157-159) suggested that retaliatory cuckoos might prevent the
   evolution of host resistance by reducing the reproductive success of
   rejecter hosts (i.e. by destroying their eggs or nestlings). Here we
   develop a model based on the association between the great spotted
   cuckoo, Clamator glandarius, and its main host, the European magpie,
   Pica pica, because this is the only system that has provided supportive
   evidence, to date, for the existence of retaliatory behaviour. Our aims
   were (1) to derive the conditions for invasion of the retaliation
   strategy in a nonretaliatory parasite population and (2) to investigate
   the consequences of retaliation for the evolution of host defence. If we
   assume a cost of discrimination for rejecter hosts in the absence of
   parasitism, and a cost paid by a retaliator for monitoring nests, our
   model shows cyclical dynamics. There is no evolutionarily stable
   strategy, and populations of both hosts and parasites will cycle
   indefinitely, the period of the cycles depending on mutation and/or
   migration rate. A stable polymorphism of accepters and rejecters occurs
   only when parasites are nonretaliators. The spread of retaliator
   parasites drives rejecter hosts to extinction. (C) 1999 The Association
   for the Study of Animal Behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to corroborate or refute the hypothesis
   that farmers having a high intake of organic grown commodities have a
   high semen quality due to their expected lower level of dietary
   pesticides intake. Food frequency data and semen were collected from 256
   farmers (171 traditional farmers and 85 organic farmers, overall
   participation rate: 32\%) who were selected from central registers. Each
   farmer delivered one semen sample before the spraying season started.
   The farmers were divided into three groups where the commodities from
   organic production contributed no (N, 0\%), medium (M, 1-49\%), or a
   high (H, 50-100\%) proportion of the fruit and vegetables consumed.
   Farmers having a high relative intake of organically grown fruit and
   vegetables also had a high relative consumption of organically produced
   meat, milk, and bread, and differences were observed comparing the
   actual mean intake of single commodities, such as rice, potato, and pork
   meat. The current individual dietary intake of 40 pesticides was
   estimated using food frequencies and generalized serving size data in
   combination with data on pesticide concentrations in food commodities as
   obtained from the National Danish Food Monitoring Program. The estimated
   pesticide intake was significantly lower among farmers of group H, but
   for all three groups of farmers the average dietary intake of 40
   pesticides was at or below 1\% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI)
   except for the dithiocarbamates (max = 0.21 mu g/kg day = 2.2\% ADI),
   methidathion, (max = 0.01 mu g/kg day = 1.4\% ADI), and 2-phenylphenol
   (max = 0.21 mu g/kg day = 1.1\% ADI). The median sperm concentration for
   the three groups of farmers was not significantly different (p = 0.40,
   median sperm concentration was N = 62, M = 44, and H = 75 million/ml).
   The group of men without organic food intake had a significant lower
   proportion of morphologically normal spermatozoa, but in relation to 14
   other semen parameters no significant differences were found between the
   groups. Intake of 40 individual pesticides was correlated with four
   semen parameters (concentration, percentage dead spermatozoa, percentage
   normal sperm heads, and motility {[}VCL]). Five significant correlations
   (p value 0.01) were found among the 160 comparisons in relation to
   percentage dead spermatozoa: azin-phos-methyl, carbaryl, chlorfenson,
   fenitrothion, and tetradifon. For all of them a lower percentage of dead
   spermatozoa were found in the groups with a high dietary intake of the
   specific pesticide. In contrast, for all pesticides evaluated only minor
   differences were found between the groups when considering spermatozoa
   concentration, morphology, and motility. In conclusion the estimated
   dietary intake of 40 pesticides did not entail a risk of impaired semen
   quality, but precautions should be taken when generalizing this negative
   result to populations with a higher dietary exposure level or an intake
   of other groups of pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{Soil is a valuable natural resource that in the short-term is
   nonrenewable and is difficult to reclaim when degraded. The use of soils
   on a sustainable basis requires that their capability to withstand the
   demands upon them is not exceeded. Those people concerned with
   conservation should be aware of the vital importance of soil for
   maintaining food supplies for an increasing world population. Increasing
   demands place a greater strain upon the soil. If the demands become too
   great, the soil becomes degraded. As soil is the basis of all
   terrestrial ecosystems, a degraded soil means lower fertility, reduced
   biodiversity, and human poverty. To provide basic information on soil
   degradation worldwide, a survey of soil loss through erosion, physical
   deterioration, and chemical pollution was made. Digital databases are
   not available to hold information necessary to monitor and combat soil
   degradation at global and national scales. Soil degradation is
   recognized as a serious and widespread problem, so in September 1987 the
   International Soil Reference and Information Centre was commissioned to
   make a survey for a map at a scale of 1 :10,000,000 entitled ``Global
   Assessment of Human-Induced Soil Degradation{''} (GLASOD). Until it was
   published in 1990, there was no uniformly collected body of information
   on soil degradation worldwide. The GLASOD survey provides basic data on
   the world distribution and intensity of erosional, chemical, and
   physical types of degradation. The original purpose of GLASOD was to
   provide factual information, to replace sweeping statements about soil
   and land degradation, and to raise awareness of policy makers and
   governments for the continuing need for soil conservation. The GLASOD
   survey also enables comparisons to be drawn between degraded soils of
   different continents, and the methodology used can be a basis upon which
   plans for restoration of degraded lands can be based.}},

Title = {{Marine reserves for fisheries management: Why not}},
Journal = {{CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{77-86}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Marine reserves have recently become a politically correct way of
   viewing the management of marine resources. Much of the reason for this
   is due to the depressed state of many of the populations that have been
   the mainstay of both. commercial and recreational marine fisheries. The
   apparent failure of past management has led to a headlong rush for a
   paradigm shift. Marine reserves that occupy no more than about 5\% of
   the productive habitat call provide sites for research, for monitoring
   natural variability and for preserving habitat and diversity for
   heritage purposes.
   But the case for large marine reserves for fisheries management purposes
   has not yet been adequately made. The few available modeling studies
   suggest that for fisheries management purposes, marine reserves need to
   be on the order of 50\% of the productive habitat. Analyses presented
   here suggest that, with reserves this large, current yields can be
   obtained only with a considerable increase in total fishing effort and a
   very large increase in the mortality rates in areas open to fishing.
   This implies a large increase in the trawling rate, and probably
   associated ecological damage, in the exploited area. Even if it were
   desirable to manage an individual species with large marine reserves,
   the concept breaks down when applied to the West Coast trawl fishery,
   which is based on many species, each with a different habitat. A marine
   reserve established for overexploited groundfish provides little real
   protection for migratory species such as Pacific hake, but may greatly
   increase the cost of fishing for these species.}},

Abstract = {{Following the 1995 mast year, we conducted detailed seedling demography
   surveys to characterize some ecological factors affecting germination
   and early establishment in understory balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.)
   Mill.) seedling banks and verify if recruitment from a cohort can
   potentially renew the balsam fir seedling bank. Twenty-five seed traps
   paired with 32 demography subplots were located in each of four
   permanent plots and regularly monitored over a 2-year period. Spatial
   patterns of newly emerged seedlings generally corresponded to those
   found for seed dispersal. However, at the end of the monitoring period,
   the spatial pattern of surviving seedlings was independent of the seed
   dispersal pattern. Seedbed types and understory light environments were
   the main factors explaining seedling mortality. Sphagnum mosses and
   decaying wood were the most favorable seedbeds for early establishment.
   The 0- to 25-cm seedling populations grew in size because of the
   addition of new recruits. If, in the years to come, mortality rates of
   the 1995 cohorts were similar to those of already established 0- to
   25-cm seedlings, mast years of seed production, at least during endemic
   periods, would be crucial for recruitment and renewal of balsam fir
   seedling banks.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual maturation and ontogenetic development of gametes were studied in
   a sample of 481 female Nile monitor lizards (Varanus niloticus L.)
   (18.8-71.5 cm snout-vent length (SVL)) from the Lake Chad region in Chad
   and Nigeria and the central delta of the Niger River in Mali. The timing
   of egg maturation suggests that only one large clutch can be produced in
   12 months, and that egg laying occurs between late November and early
   January. Each year, about 45-50\% of mature females, on average, lay
   eggs, but local sampling shows that this proportion varies greatly.
   Females reach sexual maturity at 36 +/- 2 cm SVL and 24 months of age.
   Clutch size (CS) increases from 12-13 to 53-60 eggs (average values for
   specimens of 36 cm and 71.5 cm SVL, respectively) with increase in SVL,
   according to the power function CS = 0.0049 SVL2.206 (specimens from
   Mali) or CS = 0.0052 SVL2.163 (specimens from the Lake Chad region).
   Conversely, the relative mass of the clutches (RCM) and their relative
   energy content (RWC) decrease during growth; hence, small (young)
   individuals are subjected to a much higher reproductive effort than
   large ones. Compared with that of most other large varanids, egg mass in
   the Nile monitor (38.8 g) is small, but reproductive output (CS) and
   effort (RCM, RWC) appear to be very high. Moreover, the specimens from
   Mali, where the species is heavily exploited, have a higher reproductive
   output and shorter longevity than those from the Lake Chad region. These
   data are discussed with reference to the ecology and local level of
   exploitation of the Nile monitor.}},

Abstract = {{The decision by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
   Species (CITES) to condition a limited sale of ivory on the status of
   elephant poaching has brought into sharp focus the technical,
   organizational, and financial challenges inherent in setting up a
   continent-wide monitoring program. The task will be particularly arduous
   in central Africa, where forest elephant populations are difficult to
   monitor and the infrastructure necessary for population monitoring is
   lacking. The magnitude of effort that will be necessary is illustrated
   by an elephant survey done in the Gamba Complex, a network of protected
   areas on the southwest coast of Gabon. Implementing the survey required
   a large-scale program for training Gabonese nationals in field survey
   and analysis methods necessary for elephant monitoring. Field work
   carried out during the training program suggests that a combination of
   reconnaissance and line transects can product statistically valid
   population estimates for a substantially lower effort than line
   transects alone. We illustrate statistical frameworks for comparing the
   efficiency of alternative sampling methods, and we analyze the
   sensitivity of current survey methods, which can detect abundance
   changes on the order of 15\% given fairly high effort levels. Although
   these training and methodological results are encouraging, they are just
   small steps in a complex and ongoing process. We argue that this process
   has many parallels with what needs to be done if the international
   conservation community is to respond to the challenge set for it by the
   1997 CITES meeting. There must be a concerted effort focused both on
   improving survey methods and on developing the human resources and
   on-the-ground infrastructure necessary to implement these methods.}},

Abstract = {{Many scientists lament the absence of data for endangered species and
   argue that mno-e funds should be spent acquiring basic information about
   population trends Using 19 years of abundance estimates for the eastern
   North Pacific gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), we sampled subsets of
   the original survey data to identify the number of years of data
   required to remove the population from the U;S. Endangered Species Act's
   (ESA) list of endangered and threatened wildlife. I;or any given
   duration of monitoring, we selected all possible combinations of
   consecutive counts. To incorporate variability in growth rates, we
   extracted a maximum likelihood estimator of growth rate and confidence
   interval about that growth rate on the assumption that the population
   changes can be approximated by a simple diffusion process with drift. We
   then applied a new approach to determine ESA status for each subset of
   survey data and found that a quantitative decision to delist is
   unambiguously supported by 11 years of data but is precariously
   uncertain with fewer than 10 years of data. The data needed to produce
   an unequivocal decision to delist gray whales cost the National Marine
   Fisheries Service an estimated U.S. \$660,000 a surprisingly modest
   expense given the fact that delisting can greatly simplify regulatory
   constraints This example highlights the value of population monitoring
   in administering the ESA and provides a compelling example of the
   utility of such information in identifying both imperiled and recovered
   species. The economic value of such data is that they provide the
   foundation for delisting, which could ultimately save much more money
   than the collection of the data would ever cost.}},

Abstract = {{Arthropod abundance on mixed-grass rangeland was determined before and
   after spray treatments for grasshopper suppression. These evaluations
   were made in field plots (16.2 ha) treated with either Beauveria
   bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin strain GHA at 1 x 10(13) conidia in 1.89
   liter oil per 0.405 ha, carbaryl at 559.88 g (AI) in 0.59 liter total
   volume per hectare, or no insecticide (untreated controls). Infectivity
   of B. bassiana was determined by capturing grasshoppers from treatment
   plots 7 d after application and monitoring them for external growth of
   the fungus. Major predators, parasitoids, and pollinators were captured
   with pitfall and malaise traps weekly throughout the summer season.
   About one-half of the grasshoppers collected from B. bassiana treatment
   plots exhibited external growth of the fungus. Formicidae, Araneae, and
   Carabidae decreased in all plots during periods of heavy precipitation
   after the treatment date, but these declines were not caused by
   mortality as a result of B. bassiana or carbaryl spray treatments.
   Ground-dwelling arthropod abundance rebounded to pretreatment levels
   approximate to 2 wk after treatments. No statistical differences in the
   abundance of aerial insects were detected with respect to treatment
   effects; however, natural increases in abundance in all plots were
   observed as the season progressed.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between the nervous and immune systems have been
   recognized in the development of neurodegenerative disease. This can be
   exploited through detection of the immune response to autoantigens in
   assessing the neurotoxicity of environmental chemicals. To test this
   hypothesis. the following questions were addressed. a) Are
   autoantibodies to nervous system (NS) antigens detected in populations
   exposed to environmental or occupational chemicals? In sera of male
   workers exposed to lead or mercury, autoantibodies, primarily IgG. to
   neuronal cytoskeletal proteins, neurofilaments (NFs). and myelin basic
   protein (MBP) were prevalent. These findings were confirmed in mice and
   rats exposed to either metal. b) Do autoantibodies to NS antigens relate
   to indices of exposure? In humans exposed to either metal, and similarly
   in exposed rats, titers of IgG against NFs and MBP significantly
   correlated with blood lead or urinary mercury the typical indices of
   exposure. c) Do autoantibodies correlate with sensorimotor deficits? In
   workers exposed to lead or mercury, a significant correlation was
   observed between IgG titers and subclinical deficits. Doses of metals
   used in rat exposures were subclinical. suggesting that autoantibodies
   may be predictive of neurotoxicity. d) Is the detection indicative of
   nervous system pathology? In rats exposed to metals, histopathology
   indicated central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system
   (PNS) damage. In addition there was evidence of astrogliosis, which is
   indicative of neuronal damage in the CNS. and the presence of IgG
   concentrated along the blood-brain barrier, as indicated by
   immunostaining for antibodies. e) Are immune responses to NS antigens
   pathogenic? Immunoglobulin fractions from rat and human sera interfered
   with neuromuscular function. These studies suggest that the detection of
   autoantibodies to NS-specific antigens may be used to monitor the
   development of neurotoxicity to environmental chemicals and that immune
   mechanisms may be involved in the progression of neurodegeneration.}},

Abstract = {{In situ bioassays using aquatic organisms serve as a link between
   laboratory and field studies. However, the ecological relevance of in
   situ studies had not previously been assessed by direct comparison with
   field data. In this study, an in situ bioassay employing Gammarus pulex
   L. (Crustacea: Amphipoda) and Limnephilus lunatus Curtis (Insecta:
   Trichoptera) was used in two agricultural tributaries and the connecting
   headstream. Simultaneously, the short-term insecticide contamination and
   the stream population dynamics of both species were monitored. During
   transient insecticide inputs (duration: about 1 h; peak concentrations:
   6.2 mu g/L fenvalerate; 0.6 mu g/L parathion-ethyl), mortality of both
   species in the in situ bioassay was significantly higher in the
   contaminated tributary than in the uncontaminated control tributary
   (analysis of variance {[}ANOVA], Fisher's protected least significant
   difference {[}PLSD]; p < 0.05). Limnephilus lunatus gave comparable
   responses in the stream; however, no mortality of G. pulex was observed
   in the stream. The reason for this difference is presumably that, in
   contrast to the bioassay, a typical avoidance behavior of G. pulex to
   pesticides, downstream drift, is possible in the field. During runoff
   events, G. pulex migrated from the potentially contaminated headstream
   section into the uncontaminated tributary, which can be regarded as a
   refuge and source for recolonization. Significantly lower coefficients
   of variance in the bioassay (greater than or equal to 0.22 compared to
   greater than or equal to 0.55 in the held samples) allow for a better
   detection of adverse effects of pesticide with this method. Hence,
   although the bioassay is valuable for identifying insecticide input
   events, supplementary field studies are necessary for an ecological
   interpretation of the results.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibians collected around mining sites, areas with extensive
   automobile traffic, and shooting ranges have been documented to contain
   high levels of lead. Lead-exposed amphibians might respond as if in
   hypoxic conditions because exposure is known to decrease hemoglobin
   levels, damage erythrocytes, and alter respiratory surfaces. Therefore,
   we exposed bullfrog larvae to either 0 or 780 mu g/L Pb and either 3.50
   or 7.85 mg/L oxygen for 7 d and monitored activity, trips to the
   surface, and buccal ventilation rates. Activity was significantly
   decreased in larvae exposed to low oxygen, Pb, or both compared to
   activity of larvae in high oxygen with no Pb. Larvae exposed to both Pb
   and low oxygen displayed higher buccal ventilation rates than larvae
   exposed to either treatment separately. Lead-exposed larvae surfaced
   significantly more often than unexposed larvae even under high-oxygen
   conditions. Lead-exposed larvae decreased in mass during the exposure
   period, whereas unexposed larvae increased in mass. Lead exposure could
   decrease survival of larvae in the field not only because of
   physiological problems due to decreased oxygen uptake but also because
   of greater predation pressure due to increased presence at the surface
   and reduced growth rates.}},

Title = {{Yield reduction in `Tahiti' lime from Panonychus citri feeding injury
   following different pesticide treatment regimes and impact on the

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments was initiated on `Tahiti' Lime trees to assess
   possible involvement in yield reduction by one or more species of
   thrips, especially Frankliniella bispinosa (Morgan) and F. kelliae
   Sakimura (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Different pesticides were applied to
   ensure adequate coverage on flowers and to maintain effective thrips
   control. Outbreaks of spider mites were anticipated because of the
   pesticides used and frequency of application. Therefore, population
   dynamics of the citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McGregor) (Acari:
   Tetranychidae) and the predacious mites Typhlodromalus peregrinus (Muma)
   (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and Agistemus floridanus Gonzalez (Acari:
   Stigmaeidae) were monitored in four pesticide treatment regimes during
   flowering on `Tahiti' lime, Citrus latifolia Tanaka in south Florida.
   Yield was significantly reduced in four pesticide treatment regimes by
   41, 31, 28 and 17\% relative to the untreated control. Elimination of
   predacious mites by the selected pesticides resulted in higher sustained
   populations of P. citri on treated trees compared to those untreated.
   The pesticide regimes resulted in differences in population densities of
   both citrus red mite and its key predators. Depending upon the treatment
   regime and application date(s), the duration and magnitude of disruption
   resulted in significant differences in yield. P. citri densities that
   averaged 5.2 or more per leaf during January-February, or 4.3 or more
   per leaf during January-March, or 3.9 or more per leaf during
   January-April contributed substantially to the feeding injury and
   resulted in reduced yield. Typhlodromalus peregrinus was the most common
   predacious mite collected during this study (80.4\%) followed by A.
   floridanus with 15.7\%.
   This study demonstrated that the use of one or more pesticides on
   `Tahiti' lime trees can negatively impact populations of citrus red
   mites and their associated predators to the detriment of yield. The
   magnitude of impact was dependent upon the treatment regime and
   application date(s). Spider mites increased because of reduced predator
   populations and use of these pesticides, especially in combination, is
   to be discouraged.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to clarify the effects of 10 identified variables on
   snipe activity (winnowing and calling) by demonstrating correlations
   between the variables and snipe activity. We monitored snipe at 2 study
   areas in southwestern Montana and northwestern Wyoming at all hours of
   the day and night during the 1996 and 1997 breeding seasons. We measured
   10 variables at established points along transects that were situated
   through the middle of each study site (8 study sites total). A total of
   1200 monitoring periods were conducted throughout the course of this
   study. Effects of each factor on snipe activity were considered by
   examining general trends in each factor's graphical representation. Our
   results identified 6 factors (season, time of day, lunar cycle, solar
   radiation, wind speed, and temperature) that are associated with snipe
   activity. Snipe were most active early in the breeding season during 2
   twilight periods during the first and last quarters of the lunar cycle.
   Low solar radiation levels, wind speeds, and temperatures were also most
   ideal conditions for snipe activity. All 6 factors should be considered
   when attempting to detect, survey, or estimate snipe populations.}},

Abstract = {{A population of feral horses (Equus caballus) in the southern Great
   Basin Desert of Nevada was monitored from 1989 to 1998 to determine
   size, distribution, and population trends. All individual horses
   observed in the population were identified by unique markings during the
   first 2 yr of study, and most animals could. be observed annually.
   During this study no new horses were identified in the population,
   indicating that no immigration occurred from outside populations. The
   population reached a high of 65 horses yearling or older in 1992 and
   declined each year thereafter, reaching a low of 36 horses in 1998.
   Estimated foal survival averaged <12\% over 8 yr. Only 11 horses were
   recruited into the population as yearlings or older animals during the
   study. Mountain lion predation is hypothesized as a major factor
   limiting growth of this feral horse population.}},

Abstract = {{Fipronil, a compound belonging to a new chemical family, the
   phenylpyrazols, was tested as a barrier treatment in Mauritania against
   bands of hoppers of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria, Forskal
   1775). An ultra-low volume formulation (ADONIS(R) 12.5 UL) was applied
   at 15.7 and 16.6/km. The doses were 1.96 and 1.04 g ai/l protected ha.
   Two sites of approximately 2800 and 7200 ha were sprayed from a
   helicopter flying at 20 m. There were 12 track spacings, ranging from
   330 m to 2600 m. The effects of fipronil on hopper bands were determined
   by comparison with the initial locust populations at the two sites.
   Several hopper bands were monitored in two untreated areas. The hopper
   bands were controlled within two days in the area up to 500 m from the
   flight path, within 7 days in the area between 1000 and 2000 m, and
   within 12 days in the area between 2000 and 2600 m. The speed of
   mortality was related to the upwind distance from the flight path. When
   AOONIS(R) 12.5 UL (12.5 g ai/l of fipronil) is applied at 16 1/km, at PO
   m height, with track spacings up to 1000 m, the efficacy was similar to
   that obtained with a blanket treatment (11 g ai/ha) performed the
   previous year in Mauritania.}},

Abstract = {{A two-year study was conducted at the Texas Agricultural Experiment
   Station farm at Munday, Texas to evaluate different relay strip crops
   for predator enhancement in cotton. The study evaluated eight relay
   strip crop treatments, including three fall crops (fall planted canola,
   Brassica rapa L., hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Roth, and wheat, Triticum
   aestivum L.), three spring crops (spring planted canola, forage sorghum,
   Sorghum bicolor L., and grain sorghum, Sorghum bicolor L.), a relay crop
   system comprised of canola planted in the fall and grain sorghum in the
   spring, and cotton planted adjacent to cotton as control. Each treatment
   consisted of four rows of the relay crop planted on both sides of an
   8-row x 23-m cotton plot, replicated three times. Predator abundance was
   monitored weekly in strip crops and cotton throughout the crop season by
   taking a 15 s D-vac sample from each plot. Gotten aphids, Aphis gossypii
   Glover, and bollworm-budworms, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie) and Heliothis
   virescens (F.) combined, were monitored in cotton plots only. Aphid
   abundance was estimated during the peak aphid period by counting the
   number of aphids on 10 upper and 10 lower leaves of cotton plants within
   each plot. Bollworm-budworm abundance was estimated by counting the
   number of larvae per 4 row-m of cotton in each plot. Predator species
   composition varied significantly among strip crops, but it did not
   significantly vary among cotton plots. Overall, strip crops
   significantly enhanced predator numbers in adjacent cotton plots during
   the first half of the growing season, but this effect dissipated after
   mid-July. Average aphid abundance in cotton was significantly affected
   by the adjacent strip crop, with the highest average number of aphids
   per leaf in control plots compared with numbers in plots adjacent to
   strip crops. A significant effect of strip crops on bollworm-budworm
   abundance was not detected, but the average bollworm-budworm larval
   abundance in our experimental plots remained below the economic
   threshold, whereas the rest of the 83 ha of cotton in the same
   experimental farm which employed the standard cropping system suffered
   from a severe bollworm-budworm infestation in both years. Average lint
   yields did not significantly vary among strip crop treatments, but
   average yields in the strip crop study plots were similar (1996) or
   significantly higher (1997) than in the plots where strip crop strategy
   was not employed. All the cover crops evaluated in this study enhanced
   the predator numbers and suppressed the aphid abundance in cotton in
   both years. However, wheat and spring canola were the two candidate
   cover crops that significantly suppressed aphid numbers in cotton both
   years, indicating a higher relay strip crop potential than the other
   cover crops evaluated. Although strip cropping of wheat or spring canola
   significantly suppressed aphid populations in cotton, a relay system
   consisting of canola planted in the spring adjacent to wheat planted in
   the fall might be more efficient than using a single strip crop in a
   pesticide-free cotton production system.}},

Abstract = {{1. Trapping and hunting records are frequently used as an index of
   animal abundance. This study demonstrates that these records can be
   misleading if sampling effort is not controlled for.
   2. Mean numbers of stoats Mustela erminea and weasels M. nivalis trapped
   by British gamekeepers have been decreasing since 1975 and 1961
   respectively, giving rise to concern that populations of both species
   may be declining. However, trapping effort has not been quantified over
   this period.
   3. A total of 203 gamekeepers in England were questioned about the
   trapping effort they expended and the number of stoats and weasels they
   trapped in 1997. The most significant factor affecting the number of
   stoats and weasels trapped was trapping effort.
   4, Gamekeepers that relied on hand-rearing game birds for shooting
   regarded stoats and weasels as a less serious problem, and made
   substantially less trapping effort, than gamekeepers that relied on wild
   game birds.
   5. The national decline in the numbers of stoats and weasels trapped may
   be the result of a decline in stoat and weasel populations. However, the
   decline is equally consistent with a reduction in trapping effort,
   corresponding to a national increase in reliance on hand-rearing game
   birds for shooting.
   6. When the effect of trapping effort was controlled for, the number of
   weasels trapped by gamekeepers in 1997 was significantly lower in the
   south-west than in other regions of England and was unusually low in
   some local areas.
   7. Trapping records can be used effectively to monitor populations of
   stoats and weasels, as long as gamekeepers record the number of traps
   set in each month and monthly totals of animals killed. Ideally, the sex
   of each animal and whether it was trapped or shot should also be
   recorded. Similar modifications should also be made to other wildlife
   monitoring schemes based on trapping and hunting records.}},

Title = {{Long-term changes in over-winter survival rates explain the decline of
   reed buntings Emberiza schoeniclus in Britain}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{798-811}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. The reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus is one of a suite of
   granivorous farmland bird species that suffered a major population
   decline in Britain during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Extensive
   monitoring data indicate a large increase in the abundance of reed
   buntings between 1963 and 1975, followed by a decline of 58\% on
   farmland and 66\% along linear waterways during the period 1975-83.
   Since 1983 numbers have remained relatively stable in both habitats.
   2. During the population decline, breeding numbers declined rapidly on
   arable and mixed farms, but remained relatively stable on pastoral
   farms. The decline on farmland was greater in northern Britain than in
   the south-east.
   3. Extensive nest recording indicated that breeding performance was
   higher during the period of population decline (2.74 young per nesting
   attempt) than during the preceding period of population increase (2.65)
   or the recent period of population stability (2.17).
   4. Minimum survival during the first year of life (estimated from
   mark-recapture data) declined during the 1970s and early 1980s, and
   increased strongly during the 1990s. The trend in first-year survival
   was independent of a weak positive relationship with winter temperature.
   Although there was evidence of a similar temporal trend in adult
   survival, this disappeared when winter temperature was taken into
   account.
   5. A demographic model indicated that the timing and magnitude of the
   observed changes in first-year survival and adult survival were each
   sufficient alone to account for the observed changes in the abundance of
   reed buntings during the period 1969-87. A reduction in over-winter
   survival was probably the main demographic cause of the reed bunting
   population decline, although loss of breeding habitat and a recent
   reduction in breeding performance may also have influenced numbers.
   6. During winter reed buntings feed mainly on small grass and weed
   seeds. The observed declines in abundance and survival rates coincide
   with the widespread introduction of a range of efficient herbicides and
   the loss of winter stubbles from British farmland. Our findings are
   therefore consistent with the hypothesis that the decline of the British
   reed bunting population was caused primarily by a reduction in food
   availability outside the breeding season. Changes in agricultural
   practices that increase the abundance of small weed and grass seed on
   farmland during winter are likely to allow at least a partial recovery
   of the British reed bunting population.}},

Abstract = {{The leaf beetle Chrysophtharta bimaculata (Olivier) is an endemic insect
   pest that can severely defoliate eucalypt forests and plantations in
   Tasmania, Australia. Damaging levels of insect defoliation on plantation
   eucalypts are minimized currently using an integrated pest management
   (IPM) system. The effects of the biological insecticide, Novodor FC
   (active ingredient: Bacillus thuringiensis variety tenebrionis) on the
   mortality, feeding, and development rates of C. bimaculata larvae are
   being evaluated for its suitability for inclusion in this IPM program.
   In a dose-response trial, Novodor was very effective at killing Ist
   instars. However, older larvae showed an increasing tolerance to the
   toxin that was not proportional to their body weight. At 20 degrees C,
   maximum mortality occurred at 4 d after treatment, although further
   natural mortality occurred until adult emergence. Novodor also prolonged
   the larval development time but deterred feeding by all stages of the
   surviving larvae. A Bt variety tencbrionis-based insecticide shows
   potential for inclusion in the IPM program with appropriate monitoring
   to identify when the majority of the population is at 1st-instar stage.
   Its feasibility would be enhanced if the toxicity to older larvae could
   be improved.}},

Abstract = {{The Clean Air Act identifies 189 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), or
   ``air toxics,{''} associated with a nide range of adverse human health
   effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has conducted a
   modeling study with the Assessment System for Population Exposure
   Nationwide (ASPEN) to gain a greater understanding of the spatial
   distribution of concentrations of these HAPs resulting from
   contributions of multiple emission sources. The study estimates year
   1990 long-term outdoor concentrations of 148 air toxics for each census
   tract in the continental United States, utilizing a Gaussian air
   dispersion modeling approach. Ratios of median national modeled
   concentrations to estimated emissions indicate that emission totals
   without consideration of emission source type can be a misleading
   indicator of air quality. The results also indicate priorities for
   improvements in modeling methodology and emissions identification. Model
   performance evaluation suggests a tendency for underprediction of
   observed concentrations, which is likely due, at least in part, to a
   number of limitations of the Gaussian modeling formulation. Emissions
   estimates for HAPs have a high degree of uncertainty and contribute to
   discrepancies between modeled and monitored concentration estimates. The
   model's ranking of concentrations among monitoring sites is reasonably
   good for most of the gaseous HAPs evaluated, with ranking accuracy
   ranging from 66 to 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{EXPOLIS is a European multicenter (Athens, Basel, Grenoble, Helsinki,
   Milan, and Prague) air pollution exposure study. It is the first
   international, population-based, large-scale study, where personal
   exposures to PM,, aerosol particles (together with volatile organic
   compounds and carbon monoxide) are being monitored. EXPOLIS is performed
   in six different centers across Europe, the sampled aerosol
   concentrations vary greatly, and the microenvironmental samples are not
   collected with the same equipment as the personal samples. Therefore
   careful equipment selection, methods development and testing, and
   thorough quality assurance and quality control (QA \& QC) procedures are
   essential for producing reliable and comparable PM,, data. This paper
   introduces the equipment, the laboratory test results, the pilot
   results, the standard operating procedures, and the QA \& QC procedures
   of EXPOLIS. Test results show good comparability and repeatability
   between personal and microenvironmental monitors for PM2.5 at different
   concentration levels measured across Europe in EXPOLIS centers.}},

Abstract = {{Successful monitoring underpins effective wildlife management insofar as
   monitoring serves to track the response of wildlife resources to
   management and to identify whether management should be continued or
   changed. Here we provide both general guidelines and specific examples
   for the design and implementation of effective monitoring programs for
   adaptive wildlife management based, in part, on lessons we have learned
   in the Galapagos Islands, where development of a comprehensive
   monitoring program for its wildlife is underway. To be effective,
   wildlife monitoring programs should (1) be framed by well-articulated
   objectives that are closely linked to management goals; (2) measure a
   subset of informative indicators with sampling methods that permit
   unbiased and statistically powerful results while minimizing costs and
   logistical problems; (3) ensure program continuity despite the vagaries
   of change in personnel, technology, and program objectives; and (4)
   quickly make accessible appropriately analyzed information to a wide
   audience, particularly policymakers. Only through such an integrated
   process can the adaptive ``loop{''} in wildlife management be closed and
   management practices and policies evolve in a manner ultimately
   beneficial to wildlife, both in Galapagos and elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the natural experiment created by gray wolf (Canis lupus)
   recolonization of the Glacier National Park area, from 1990 to 1996 we
   examined population trends and female survival rates of white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and moose (Alccs
   alccs) preyed upon by wolves, cougars (Puma concolor), bears (Ursus
   spp.), coyotes (Canis latrans), and humans. The effects of the complete
   suite of native large carnivores on prey have not been previously
   reported. Annual survival rates were 0.74 for 64 deer. 0.83 for 53 elk,
   and 0.88 for 47 moose, Cougars and wolves were the most significant
   sources of mortality for deer (0.09 and 0.06 respective annual
   cause-specific mortality rates) and elk (0.06 and 0.03 respective annual
   cause-specific mortality rates), and wolves and bears were the most
   significant sources of mortality for moose (0.03 and 0.04 respective
   annual cause-specific mortality rates). All age classes of deer were
   relatively equally vulnerable to predators, while young and old moose
   and elk were most vulnerable. Moose survival al rates were higher where
   wolves were absent and where white-tailed deer were present. Deer and
   elk populations declined as wolf numbers increased (lambda = 1.20). The
   moose population remained relatively stable. Predation appeared to be
   the primary factor limiting growth of deer and elk populations in this
   system. Predator-prey managers need to carefully monitor prey
   populations in areas wolves recognize. Managers may be able to
   manipulate alternative prey densities to enhance prey populations that
   are affected by wolves, cougars, and bears.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored movement and activity patterns of 38 desert tortoises
   (Gopherus agassizii) at 2 locations in the southcentral Mojave Desert
   during 2 consecutive years differing markedly in winter rainfall. During
   the first year, winter precipitation was 225\% greater than the
   long-term average for this region, whereas a drought the following year
   resulted in precipitation that was 25\% of the long-term average. These
   winter rains produced 2 distinct patterns of annual plant productivity:
   a bloom of annuals the first year, followed by their complete absence
   the second year. As measured by radiotelemetry home range size, the
   number of different burrows used, average distances traveled per day,
   and levels of surface versus burrow activity were significantly reduced
   in both populations during the drought year. The pooled distribution of
   between-observation distances traveled showed a shift favoring
   shorter-distance movements during the drought year. Differences in
   levels of winter precipitation between years and the resulting variation
   of winter annual biomass in the spring appear to play a significant role
   in desert tortoise movement and activity patterns. Future manage ment
   and conservation plans for the desert tortoise should consider weather
   and productivity as important factors influencing annual home range
   size, number of burrows used, average distances traveled, and activity
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Harvest of crocodilian eggs and young for captive rearing (ranching) has
   been used worldwide as an option for producing crocodilian skills and
   meat from wild stock. The long-term effects of harvesting a certain
   proportion of early age class, wild American alligators (Alligator
   mississippiensis) without repatriation is unknown. We removed an
   estimated 50\% of annual production of alligators on Lakes Griffin and
   Jesup in central Florida over an 11-year period and monitored population
   levels via night-light counts. Densities of the total alligator
   population increased (P < 0.037) on all areas. Count densities of adult
   (greater than or equal to 183 cm total length {[}TL]) alligators
   increased (P < 0.003) on harvest areas but remained stable (P = 0.830)
   on the control (no han est) area, Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge
   (Lake Woodruff NWR). Observed densities of juvenile (<122 cm TL)
   alligators remained stable (P > 0.117), and subadult (122-182 cm TL)
   alligators increased (P < 0.011) on han est areas. The density of
   juveniles on the control area increased (P = 0.006), and the density of
   subadults showed some evidence of increasing (P = 0.088). No changes
   were detected in size distributions on the treatment areas. Nest
   production, as observed from aerial helicopter surveys, increased (P <
   0.039) on Lake Woodruff NWR and Lake Jesup and showed some evidence of
   an increase on Lake Griffin (P = 0.098) during 1983-91. A 50\% harvest
   rate of eggs or hatchlings did not adversely affect recruitment into the
   subadult or adult size classes.}},

Abstract = {{Despite intensive management on many grassland areas, nest loss to
   predators continues to result in low nest-survival rates. Management
   efforts are complicated by complex relationships among habitat,
   predators, and prey resources. We monitored the fates of artificial
   nests (908 in 1993, 827 in 1994) on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
   plots from April to July to test effects of prey supplementation,
   vegetation density, and time (month) on nest survival in agricultural
   and range landscapes in northwest Texas. Supplemental prey had the
   greatest effect on artificial nest survival and increased nest survival
   in both sparse and dense vegetation. Prey supplementation may be useful
   when used in conjunction with habitat management for dense nesting cover
   or in areas that already have dense vegetation. Nest survival was
   highest early in the nesting season, emphasizing the importance of
   available nesting cover during this period. Although least important,
   dense vegetation increased artificial nest survival. When evaluating
   management options, managers should consider logistical and economic
   costs of using supplemental prey, as well as potential effects on
   predator population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The probability of failing to detect a trend when 1 exists has been
   considered only rarely in the interpretation of monitoring studies.
   Retrospective power analysis accomplishes this assessment. me apply
   retrospective power analysis to evaluate both population trends and
   survey design in the waterfowl surveys conducted by the Canadian
   Wildlife Service and others around Riske Creek, British Columbia. Eleven
   of 18 species showed long-term (17 yr) and short-term (10 yr) trends.
   For the remaining 7 species, the long-term analysis had sufficient power
   (0.8) to have detected at least a 5\% annual change, had 1 existed,
   which supported the conclusion that little change occurred. However,
   statistical power and detectable effects varied considerably among
   species, with a range of 3-14 years of data needed to be able to detect
   a 5\% annual trend. When we used the shorter-term dataset, power was
   reduced below acceptable levels for 4 of the 7 species failing to show a
   trend. It would be a mistake to conclude that the numbers of these 4
   species were not changing. Statistical power was highest for the species
   for which the surveys were originally designed, Barrow's goldeneye
   (Bucephala islandica) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), which had
   narrow confidence intervals and relatively small minimum detectable
   trends. In contrast, blue-winged teal (Anas discors), gadwall (Anas
   strepera), green-winged teal (Anas crecca), northern pintail (Anas
   acute), and northern shoveler (Anas clypeata) had relatively large
   minimum detectable trends and nide confidence intervals. Much of the
   power of these surveys was due to repeated surveying within seasons. For
   most species, power increased substantially by including up to 4 surveys
   as replicate observations within a year, but power increased little when
   data from a fifth or sixth survey were included.}},

Abstract = {{A primary culture of a mixed-cell population from the digestive gland of
   the marine mussel Mytilus edulis L. was developed for potential use in
   toxicological studies. Cells were maintained for up to 2 wk in a
   suspension culture, and their survival rate was monitored with regard to
   different cell types. No cell proliferation was observed. Smaller cell
   types survived with a viability of >50\% after 13 d in culture, whereas
   the larger, lysosome-containing digestive cells deteriorated rapidly
   (viability < 50\% after 3 d). Differential survival rates of the two
   cell groups was confirmed by an ultrastructural analysis of cell
   morphology in cells cultured for up to 4 d. Electron-microscope
   micrographs revealed that some structural damage of digestive cells
   began soon after initiation of the culture, with subsequent
   deterioration and death. In contrast, smaller cell types such as duct
   epithelial cells appeared relatively healthy and dominated the cell
   culture. A study of antioxidant and biotransformation enzyme activities
   in digestive-gland cells revealed a time-course pattern of change in
   activity levels possibly linked to differential cell survival. The
   activities of the biotransformation enzymes NADH-DT diaphorase (EC
   1.6.99.2), cytochrome P450-dependent benzo{[}a]pyrene hydroxylase and
   glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) decreased more rapidly over time
   than the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (EC 1.11.1.6)
   and superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1). This possibly indicates that
   antioxidant enzyme activity is more stable over time than that of
   biotransformation enzymes and/or that the capacity of xenobiotic
   metabolism is primarily located in the large digestive cells, whereas
   antioxidant functions can be found in both digestive and smaller cell
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{To assess large-whale stocks following the cessation of land-based South
   Georgia whaling in 1965, we report three independent sighting:
   databases: a cruise in 1997, observations from Bird Island (NW of South
   Georgia) between 1979 and 1998, and mariner sightings between 1992 and
   1997. All species were rare, with sightings of southern right whales
   being the most common event. Two right whales photographed off South
   Georgia matched animals known from Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, a
   population known to be growing at 7\% per annum. In contrast, blue and
   fin whales appeared to be less abundant. A single blue whale
   mot-her-calf pair was observed off the Shag Rocks in February 1997.
   Extirpation. of animals from this particular feeding ground is the most
   likely reason for ongoing law numbers of all species. Other factors may
   include competition for krill by traditional predators such as penguins
   and seals and more recently by humans, an unusually high rate of natural
   mortality, habitat change such as alteration in sea ice coverage, and/or
   the impact of ongoing whaling. The history of this critical area of
   large-whale habitat and this report demonstrate the need for improved,
   consistent longterm monitoring of population trends for these depleted
   stocks.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the effects of environmental changes on stream bacterial
   populations, assemblage-and population-level measurements were compared
   between an anthropogenically disturbed stream and an undisturbed
   reference stream during different seasons, Physical and chemical
   variables monitored at two disturbed sites from a stream affected by
   multiple environmental perturbations confirmed discernibly different
   water quality from three reference sites: two from an adjacent,
   undisturbed watershed and one hom the headwaters of the polluted stream.
   Assemblage-revel variables, including: total number of bacteria, colony
   forming units, and number of Bacteria from in situ hybridization
   revealed only one statistically significant difference between disturbed
   and undisturbed sites. Population-level changes of three bacterial
   species, Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter
   calcoaceticus, were determined by colony hybridization with rDNA probes.
   Abundance of culturable A. calcoaceticus was higher at: disturbed sites
   in November and February; B. cepacia. and P. putida did not exhibit
   pollution-associated responses. In contrast, in situ hybridization
   indicated that there was more A. calcoaceticus at the reference sites in
   November and April, suggesting that culturability of the species
   increased at disturbed sites. To determine if differences among sites
   were attributable to changes in water quality among the streams, three
   bacterial strains isolated from the disturbed stream were grown for 64 h
   in flasks in water from disturbed and reference sites. As observed in
   the stream, A. calcoaceticus numbers increased in polluted stream water
   after an initial lag period of approximately 24 h. Our results indicate
   that although assemblage-level measurements of bacterial communities did
   not reflect environmental differences among sites, A. calcoaceticus;
   population sizes differed between disturbed and reference sites,
   suggesting that anthropogenic disturbance can alter some bacterial
   populations and not others.}},

Title = {{The decay of forest woody debris: numerical modeling and implications
   based on some 300 data cases from North America}},

Abstract = {{The decay rate of forest woody debris (WD) is a key missing link for a
   quantitative understanding of forest carbon dynamics and the global
   carbon budget. This paper reports an attempt to synthesize the available
   information into a unifying and testable numerical model pertinent to
   the analysis and projection of WD decay in field conditions. The model
   is rooted in an integrative theory that depicts decay as a process of
   substrate quality degradation along with feedback responses of microbial
   activity. It is parameterized through regression analysis against 112
   data cases of stem and branch WD decay in North America, and then is
   evaluated against 132 additional data cases for stem and branch WD, and
   75 data cases for root WD decay. The root mean square errors of both the
   fitted and the projected WD decay rates are about 14\% of the means of
   respective data sets. Aided by peripheral algorithms, the model solves
   WD decay with data requirements limited to (1) tree species, and (2) air
   temperature and precipitation in January and July for forested sites,
   plus (3) latitude and elevation for deforested sites. The mathematical
   and physical implications of the model by its component functions and as
   a whole are generally supported by independent evidence from the
   literature where available. Those implications include: (I) the observed
   decay rate is lower when defined by density loss than by mass loss, when
   inferred from chronosequence survey than from population monitoring, or
   when estimated with specimens with end-coating than without coating; (2)
   the initial quality of WD differs between Abies/Picea and other species
   among conifers, or along the gradients of shade tolerance and normal
   stem slenderness among the deciduous trees; (3) the basic microbial
   growth rate (the rate at a WD quality of unity) increases with ambient
   temperature but decreases along the gradients of July
   precipitation-to-potential evapotranspiration ratio and January
   precipitation under forested conditions; and (4) WD decay may be
   accelerated or hampered after canopy removal, depending on local air
   humidity. The model further suggests that the lower of substrate quality
   and the basic microbial growth rate exerts a proportionally greater
   constraint on the decay rate, so the difference in WD decay by substrate
   and site narrows as the substrate quality degrades over time. Thus, a 2
   degrees C warming in air temperature would accelerate stem WD decay by
   9-55\% across the data sites for the Ist year, but only 1-14\% by year
   100.}},

Abstract = {{Boundaries associated with reserves or conservation areas may alter
   spatial patterns of individuals, and may affect the sexes differently in
   species that exhibit sex-specific patterns of space use. Because of
   poaching threats, most African rhinos today persist within sanctuaries
   or reserves with fenced perimeters. We examined spatial patterns of
   adult white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum) in Matobo National Park,
   Zimbabwe. Matobo Park contains a high-density population of rhinos
   within a fenced reserve and a lower-density group outside of the fenced
   area. Adult females in the lower-density group used significantly larger
   home ranges than those in the high-density group. Overlap among female
   home ranges was extensive in both groups. Adult male white rhinos
   establish territories that are exclusive of other males performing
   scent-marking behaviours, and in Matobo Park, male territories were much
   larger than those observed in other populations of white rhinos.
   Additionally, few adult males in the high-density reserve held
   territories that occupied most available space; two-thirds of adult
   males were excluded from establishing territories, and followed a
   non-territorial tactic. In the absence of dispersal opportunities,
   managers may need to regulate the number of males within smaller
   reserves. Monitoring of spatial patterns should be undertaken to permit
   management decisions to be made with an understanding of male behaviour
   and territorial status.}},

Title = {{Genetic diversity of Typha latifolia (Typhaceae) and the impact of
   pollutants examined with tandem-repetitive DNA probes}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1226-1238}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Genetic diversity at variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) loci was
   examined in the common cattail, Typha latifolia (Typhaceae), using three
   synthetic DNA probes composed of tandemly repeated ``core{''} sequences
   (GACA, GATA, and GCAC). The principal objectives of this investigation
   were to determine whether: (1) the previously reported almost complete
   lack of polymorphism at allozyme loci in this species was indicative of
   a reduced amount of genetic diversity at VNTR loci as well; (2) VNTR
   markers were informative about possible clonal propagation; and (3)
   significant differences in genetic structure of sampling sites were
   associated with differences in environmental levels of pollutants at
   these sites. Previously, widespread sampling across the eastern United
   States, surveying across ten allozyme loci, has detected only two
   genotypes, involving a difference at a single locus, among 104
   populations. In this study, the amount of genetic diversity detected at
   VNTR loci: (1) among ramets (N = 40; 40 genotypes detected) collected at
   similar to 8-km intervals along a 320-km transect; (2) among ramets (N =
   220; 117 genotypes detected) from five study sites separated by 50-3000
   m; and (3) even among ramets within each study site {[}N = 44 per site;
   from 13 to 34 genotypes detected per site (270 m(2))] exceeds that
   previously found in those more geographically widespread allozyme
   surveys. Among the 260 ramets analyzed here, the mean number of bands
   scored per individual was 48.61 (SD = 2.80). Mean genetic similarity
   among ramets collected along the 320-km transect was 0.91, which was
   within the range of mean genetic similarity within the five study sites
   (range: 0.89-0.95). Among the five study sites, 61\% of the samples
   analyzed appeared to be clonal ramets, with up to 12 clones detected for
   44 ramets sampled within a site. Clones grew intermingled and ranged up
   to 39 m in extent. Permutation tests of genetic similarity revealed
   significant genetic differentiation between each of the five study
   sites. Consistent with the previous allozyme studies, T. latifolia was
   characterized by extremely low genetic variation relative to levels of
   polymorphism detected at VNTR loci in other plant species. Estimated
   heterozygosity among ramets along the 320-km transect lan,oed from 0.11
   to 0.13, while that within the five study sites ranged from 0.05 to
   0.12. Estimates of F-st (0.32-0.41) also indicated considerable genetic
   subdivision among these stands. Significantly higher genetic diversity
   was detected at the two study sites that chemistry and toxicity data
   indicate to be the most severely impacted by pollutants. Although this
   correlation does not establish cause and effect, the results of this
   study indicate that the analysis of genetic diversity at VNTR loci may
   be a useful tool for monitoring anthropogenic-induced changes in the
   genetic structure of natural populations of plants.}},

Abstract = {{Intertidal mussels usually form complex multilayered matrices with
   density-dependent effects on survival and growth, and self-thinning
   scaling between biomass (B) and density (N) is expected. This article
   develops a tridimensional model of space-driven self-thinning that in
   addition to B-N explicitly includes the degree of packing of the
   mussels, measured as the number of layers (L). The structure of our
   model (B-N-L) encompasses previous bidimensional models (B-N) of
   self-thinning as special cases and enables comparisons between mono- and
   multilayered populations. We contrast the predictions of the bi- and
   tridimensional models using data obtained from Perumytilus purpuratus
   mussel beds on the rocky shores of central Chile monitored during a
   28-mo period. The tridimensional model suggests that density dependence
   is much more frequent than hitherto indicated by bidimensional models.
   We propose that our space-driven tridimensional model may be applied nor
   only to mussels but also to other species where spatial overlapping
   configurations occur.}},

Abstract = {{Benzene is a widely distributed environmental contaminant that causes
   leukemia. It is an important component in gasoline, it is used
   frequently as a solvent or chemical feedstock in industry, and it is
   emitted as a product of incomplete combustion. In Mexico City,
   investigators suspect that benzene exposure might be elevated and may
   pose a risk to the population; however, no published data are available
   to confirm or disconfirm this suspicion. We, therefore, conducted a
   survey in 3 occupational groups in Mexico City. Forty-five volunteers
   who used portable passive monitors measured their personal exposure to
   benzene during a workshift. None of the participants smoked during the
   monitoring period. Benzene exposure was significantly higher among
   service-station attendants (mean = 359.5 mu g/m(3) {[}standard deviation
   = 170.4 mu g/m(3)]) than among the street vendors (83.7 mu g/m(3) and
   45.0 mu g/m(3), respectively) and office workers (45.2 mu g/m(3) and
   13.3 mu g/m(3), respectively). However, the benzene exposure levels
   observed among office workers were substantially higher than levels
   reported elsewhere for general populations. Our results highlight the
   need for more complete studies by investigators who should assess the
   potential benefits of setting environmental standards for benzene in
   Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1988 and 1995, dens in three adjacent arctic fox (Alopex
   lagopus) territories were monitored in an alpine environment in
   south-central Norway (the Snohetta plateau). A total of 675 seats were
   collected at dens in both winter and summer, and the numbers of resident
   adults and pups at emergence were counted each summer. Small rodents
   (mainly Lemmus sp, and Microtus sp.) were the most frequently consumed
   prey and made up the greatest volume within seats, in ail seasons and at
   all stages of the rodent cycle. Small rodents were followed in frequency
   by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), hares (Lepus timidus), birds, and
   vegetation. Birds and vegetation were more common in the summer diet
   than in the winter diet, reflecting their seasonal availability. The
   relative volume of reindeer and birds in the diet decreased with
   increasing rodent abundance. Increased pup production was associated
   with years of high rodent abundance and a high occurrence of rodents in
   the diet. Adult numbers were not associated with rodent abundance.}},

Title = {{Translocation of slow-worms (Anguis fragilis) as a mitigation strategy:
   a case study from south-east England}},

Abstract = {{Translocation is often used as mitigation in cases where sites
   containing protected species are threatened by development. However, the
   conservation value of such exercises is unproven for many species. This
   paper describes a case study in which translocation was used as a
   mitigation measure for the slow-worm (Anguis fragilis) a cryptic legless
   lizard. At a site scheduled for development, the removal of 103 lizards
   over a three-month period resulted in no significant depletion of the
   population. At the receptor site, which had no previous slow-worm
   population, recaptures of translocated slow-worms declined during 2
   years of subsequent monitoring; recaptured lizards were in poorer
   condition than those in a nearby natural population; and there was
   little evidence of successful reproduction. As the exercise may have
   prevented the inadvertent killing of a number of slow-worms, it may have
   been successful in terms of meeting the statutory obligations for this
   species. As an exercise in conserving the population in the longterm,
   however, the value of the translocation was questionable. (C) 1999

Title = {{The recent distribution of endemic, disjunct and globally uncommon birds
   in the forests of Kerala State, south-west India}},
Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{191-225}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We surveyed the avifaunas of 24 forest areas in Kerala State,
   south-western India, over the period 1973-1997, recording 309 species.
   We give details here of distributions and status for all species endemic
   to South Asia and all those having isolated populations, disjunct from
   conspecifics in northern India (disjunct species). Most bird species
   found in Kerala that are endemic to southern India, or form disjunct
   populations, occur in forest habitats. Those species endemic to the
   Western Ghats (passerines), or constituting disjunct populations
   (raptors) tend to have more restricted occurrence than other forest
   birds. For the passerines this is because they are mainly confined to
   high elevation forests and grasslands: rather restricted habitats in
   Kerala. The raptors may be more dependent than other species on large
   areas of forest and hence may have suffered from recent reductions in
   forest cover. Current trends in forest clearance for agriculture and
   plantations and encroachment by settlers, threaten especially the birds
   of low and middle altitude forests. The present status of such birds as
   Malabar Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros coronatus, Great fared Nightjar
   Eurostopodus macrotis, Lesser Coucal Centropus bengalensis and
   White-bellied Blue Flycatcher Cyornis pallipes seems to be markedly
   worse than that described by Ali (1969) for the 1930s. These species, as
   well as Dollarbird Eurystomus orientalis and Black-crested Baza Aviceda
   leuphotes, are patchily distributed at low densities and may be
   vulnerable to extirpation from local areas. Higher altitude habitats,
   where many endemics occur, cover smaller areas, but are less threatened.
   However, some species occurring at low densities (Rufous-bellied Eagle
   Hieraaetus kienerii, White-bellied Shortwing Brachypteryx major,
   Black-and-orange Flycatcher Ficedula nigrorufa, Broad-tailed Grassbird
   Schoenicola platyura) may be vulnerable to extirpation or extinction in
   the long term. Kerala has a large network of protected areas (National
   Parks, Sanctuaries). Effective protection of those areas should be
   sufficient to maintain most species, although the coverage of low
   altitude forest is poor and remaining fragments should be carefully
   protected. There is continuous pressure on all habitats and bird
   populations will need to be carefully monitored in future if Kerala's
   endemic and disjunct populations are to be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Little Cayman, in the north-west Caribbean, supports a
   large breeding colony of Red-footed Boobies Sula sula, within a Ramsar
   site, the Booby Pond Nature Reserve, protected and managed by the
   National Trust for the Cayman Islands. Comparison of aerial photographs
   from 1994 and 1997 shows the colony area unchanged over this time
   period, occupying 16.5 ha. Area sampling yielded an estimate of 4,839
   nesting pairs on Little Cayman in 1997, representing c. 30\% of the
   entire Caribbean population for this species. Low mortality and
   excellent condition of chicks indicated a very successful breeding year
   with good food availability. Aerial photography proved to be an
   effective tool for determining the colony area but nests visible on
   these images did not correlate sufficiently well with ground data to be
   considered a viable basis for population monitoring. The 1997 census
   will serve as an important baseline, as Little Cayman is on the brink of
   explosive real estate development which is likely to have a severe
   impact on the island's natural resources over the next decade.}},

   population of plovers over seven breeding seasons, 1991-1998. Mortality
   of nests (about 60\%), and of chicks (over 70\%) was high, but
   preliminary data suggests mortality was low in juveniles. The major
   cause of mortality of nests was trampling by people. The causes of
   mortality in chicks is unknown, but mortality was age dependent, and was
   highest in the youngest chicks. A combination of management techniques
   that have been phased into operation over the seven years of the study
   appear to be increasing the reproductive success of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Potato cyst (Globodera spp.), root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.), and root
   lesion (Pratylenchus spp.) nematodes are the most economically important
   nematodes of potatoes in temperate climates. Potato cyst nematodes occur
   worldwide and include two species, Globodera pallida (the white cyst
   nematode) and Globodera rostochiensis (the golden nematode), each
   composed of several pathotypes. The gene HI, which confers a high level
   of resistance to the golden nematode pathotype Ro1, has been bred into
   several potato cultivars that are grown worldwide. Mapping of the H-1
   gene has led to the development of a molecular marker to screen
   segregating populations for resistance to the golden nematode and to
   monitor the use of resistant cultivars in statutory control programs.
   Pathotype Ro2 of the golden nematode that overcomes H-1-mediated
   resistance was recently discovered in New York State in the United
   States, and a high level of resistance to this pathotype has been
   identified. Several sources of resistance to G. pallida are known and
   have been used in traditional potato breeding programs to develop
   cultivars resistant to this species. Molecular markers that are closely
   linked to genes for resistance to two G. pallida pathotypes have been
   identified in different regions of the potato genome. Although
   resistance to root-knot and root lesion nematodes has been identified,
   limited success has been realized in the use of this resistance either
   through classical or molecular techniques to manage these nematodes on
   potatoes. Engineered resistance genes are currently being developed that
   may prove effective against both species of potato cyst nematodes as
   well as other nematode parasites of potato.}},

Abstract = {{We tested effects of growing-season length and site fertility on early
   seedling growth and seedling establishment in a snowbed population of
   Ranunculus adoneus. On average, growing-season length decreases by 30\%
   from shallow to deeper parts of the snowbed. Past work has shown that
   plant cover and soil fertility decline with delayed snowmelt date along
   this steep habitat gradient. We experimentally uncoupled the
   relationship between snowmelt schedule and site fertility by adding snow
   to plots at naturally shallow snow depths and removing snow prematurely
   from plots with naturally deeper snow in the summers of 1991-1994. Seeds
   of R. adoneus were transplanted into manipulated plots and adjacent
   control plots in 1990 and 1991. Seedling shoot size and survival were
   monitored over the course of the experiment. Production of true (adult)
   leaves by newly emerging seedlings was significantly reduced by the
   delayed snowmelt schedule. Seedlings failing to produce true leaves
   during their first summer were at a strong survival disadvantage over
   the winter months. Leaf length for seedlings that produced true leaves
   was not affected by snowmelt or location on the snow depth gradient; nor
   did leaf length affect overwinter survival.
   We defined seedling establishment as the successful transition from seed
   to seedling of age two years. At this age, all seedlings have produced
   true leaves. Effects of growing-season length on seedling establishment
   rate were pronounced in inner portions of the snowbed. There, average
   establishment success increased from <1\% under natural conditions to
   5\% with experimental extension of the growing season. In contrast,
   establishment rate in plots near the snowbed edge tended to increase
   when snowmelt was experimentally delayed. Possibly, delaying snowmelt in
   relatively fertile outer plots enhanced establishment by synchronizing
   seed germination with warmer mid-season soil temperatures in the snowbed
   environment. Regrowth of other plant species into planting microsites
   occurred more extensively in early snowmelt plots than in late snowmelt
   plots but had little effect on seedling establishment. Pooled across the
   entire cohort of germinating seedlings, emergence, survival over the
   first winter, and survival during the second growing season contributed
   significantly to variation in establishment rate (R-2 = 37\% 7\%, and
   32\%, respectively) but were poorly intercorrelated (r = -0.15). These
   findings show that sites favorable at any one stage in establishment do
   not remain favorable at other stages.
   We conclude that the relationship between growing-season length and
   seedling establishment success in snow buttercups depends on other
   aspects of microsite quality. In nutrient-poor habitats, short growing
   seasons play a major role in restricting establishment. However, in more
   fertile sites, the timing of snowmelt and its associated effects on the
   quality of the microclimate for seed germination may be more critical
   than the period of time from snowmelt until the onset of winter. For
   snow buttercup seedlings much of establishment is stochastic, in that
   microsites conducive to emergence do not ensure survival over subsequent
   phases of the life cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic changes were monitored in free-ranging European rabbit
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations in Australia following the surgical
   imposition of four levels of female sterility (0\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%).
   Rabbit productivity decreased with increasing sterility level, but a
   greater proportion of offspring were recruited into populations with
   high levels of sterility. Adult rabbits, particularly sterile females,
   also survived better in the high sterility populations. Thus we were
   able to experimentally demonstrate that two density-dependent processes
   were operating on our rabbit populations: one was acting on juvenile
   survival, the other on the survival of infertile adult rabbits. However,
   these compensatory mechanisms were insufficient to overcome the effects
   of sterility in the high sterility populations and the seasonal
   abundance of rabbits decreased. Female sterility levels of 60\%-80\%
   would benefit rabbit control programs by reducing the peaks of rabbit
   abundance. This effect is likely to be enhanced if fertility control
   could be integrated with other pest control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Total fluoride (F) content of soils, vegetation, and cotton rats
   (Sigmodon hispidus) was measured on a landfarm contaminated with
   petrochemical wastes. A potentially bioavailable form of F was
   determined by HCl extraction of soils and vegetation. Cotton rats from
   the landfarm were examined for dental lesions indicative of fluorosis.
   Exposure pathways including dietary ingestion of unwashed vegetation and
   nondietary ingestion of soil associated with grooming and burrowing were
   evaluated. Mean bone F (1,515 mg/kg) and mean soil total F (1,954 mg/kg)
   from the landfarm site were greater than bone F (121 mg/kg) and soil
   total F (121 mg/kg) at a reference site. The HCl-extractable F was
   elevated in landfarm soil (326 mg/kg) compared to the reference site
   (2.3 mg/kg). About 80\% of the cotton rats collected from the landfarm
   had dental fluorosis. During winter, the dietary pathway consisted of
   78.9\% of the potential bioavailable exposure (HCl-extractable F) of the
   two exposure pathways. However, in the summer, the nondietary pathway
   consisted of 87.9\% of the potential bioavailable exposure of the two
   pathways. incidental ingestion of soil associated with grooming and
   burrowing is more important than consumption of unwashed vegetation for
   cotton rats on the landfarm site in the summer. Fluoride accumulation in
   the soil from landfarming of petroleum wastes may pose a risk to
   terrestrial vertebrates. In addition to monitoring petroleum
   hydrocarbons, land application of petrochemical wastes should consider F
   and other inorganic contaminant loadings to the soil system.}},

Abstract = {{In a three-year study, mite populations were monitored in two vineyards,
   each having two grape varieties with different leaf hair density. In
   both vineyards native phytoseiids were present: Amblyseius andersoni in
   one vineyard, and Phytoseius finitimus in the other. The economically
   important predators Kampimodromus aberrans and Typhlodromus pyri were
   released in both vineyards in order to study their efficacy in
   controlling tetranychids and eriophyids and their persistence during
   periods of prey scarcity. In both vineyards, relative abundances of the
   mite species, especially phytoseiids, were found to differ on different
   varieties in the same vineyard. In the first experiment, A. andersoni
   reached higher densities and was more persistent on the variety with
   slightly pubescent leaf under-surface (Merlot). Typhlodromus pyri and K.
   aberrans releases were successful and the mites became more abundant on
   the variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Verduzzo). In the second
   experiment, P. finitimus was more abundant on a variety with pubescent
   leaf under-surface (Prosecco) than with glabrous leaf under-surface
   (Riesling). The most interesting results of the present study concerned
   the interactions between native and released predators. In the first
   vineyard, different results were obtained when releasing T. pyri on the
   two varieties. On the variety with pubescent leaves, A. andersoni was
   rapidly displaced by T. pyri, whereas the former species persisted on
   the other variety throughout the three-year study, apparently becoming
   dominant during the last season. In contrast to T. pyri, interactions
   between K. aberrans and A. andersoni in this vineyard did not depend on
   variety. The results of the experiments carried out in the second
   vineyard stressed the importance of interspecific competition for
   phytoseiid releases. Typhlodromus pyri colonization failed on both
   varieties. Kampimodromus aberrans releases appeared to be more
   successful on Riesling than on Prosecco, where P. finitimus was more
   abundant. At the end of the experiments, K. aberrans displaced P.
   finitimus on both varieties.}},

Abstract = {{As wild fish populations continue to decline, fisheries managers are
   increasingly concerned about how hatchery operations might be
   contributing to declines of highly valued wild populations. Ecological
   risk assessments can provide decision makers with critical information
   about potential effects of stocking. In this paper we describe a
   practical approach for assessing ecological risks to select nontarget
   taxa (NTT) associated with fish stocking programs. This approach
   requires the completion of five tasks: (1) Determine acceptable impacts
   to NTT (e.g., impact of 10\% to a species distribution, abundance, or
   size structure); (2) determine potential spatial-temporal overlap of NTT
   life stages with target taxon; (3) determine potential strong ecological
   interactions; (4) determine ecological risk; and (5) determine
   scientific uncertainty of ecological risk assessment. These tasks are
   accomplished by analyzing information gathered from scientists,
   managers, and policy makers. The result of the assessment is a listing
   of the ecological risks and associated uncertainties of failing to meet
   a stated objective for a variety of NTT. We also describe a decision
   matrix that prescribes various levels of uncertainty resolution, risk
   minimization strategies, risk containment monitoring, and stocking
   proposal implementation. Prescriptions reflect the amount of ecological
   risk and scientific uncertainty. Application of ecological risk
   assessment concepts to hatchery stocking decisions allows for a balanced
   approach when evaluating the benefits of hatchery stocking relative to
   ecological costs to nontarget populations and the economic costs of risk
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal and geographical patterns of spawning for Georges Bank cod
   (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) are estimated
   using composite distributions of stage I eggs derived from the Marine
   Resources Monitoring, Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) data set
   (1977-1987). The inferred mean spawning locations are compared with
   patterns in particle residence times derived from a three-dimensional
   prognostic circulation model that estimates the tidal and seasonal mean
   circulation. The comparisons indicate that cod and haddock spawning
   occurs at times and locations characterized by model residence times in
   excess of 35 d. The results are discussed in the context of fish
   population regulation theory, particularly the member/vagrant hypothesis
   and the concept of abundance-dependent vagrancy.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the brown citrus aphid (BCA), Toxoptera citricida
   (Kirkaldy), and associated insects were monitored in citrus groves in
   western Puerto Rico in 1996 and 1997. Peak populations of the aphid were
   observed in spring and fall of both years. A total of 6,737 infested
   citrus terminals were examined and categorized by growth stage and BCA
   colony size. Natural enemies, primarily coccinellids, syrphids,
   chrysopids, and aphidiids, were recorded when present in BCA colonies
   and a list of species is presented. A complex of large coccinellid
   species was inferred to have the greatest potential for impact on BCA
   populations in Puerto Rico. Predation by syrphid larvae was another
   important source of BCA mortality. The parasitoid, Lysiphlebus
   testaceipes (Cresson), was abundant in some samples, but usually
   parasitized only a small percentage of aphids within colonies. The
   fungus, Verticillium lecanii (Zimm.), infected BCA colonies
   sporadically. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, was
   often observed harvesting honeydew from BCA colonies and interfering
   with natural enemies.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic biota in the Rhone River downstream of the Marcoule nuclear
   complex in Prance are exposed to natural sources of radiation and to
   radioactivity released from the Marcoule complex. A simple conservative
   screening level model was used to estimate the range of concentrations
   in aquatic media (water, sediments, and aquatic organisms) of both
   artificial and natural radionuclides and the consequent absorbed (whole
   body) dose rates for aquatic organisms. Five categories of aquatic
   organisms were studied, namely, submerged aquatic plants (phanerogam),
   non-bottom-feeding fish, bottom-feeding fish, mollusca, and fish-eating
   birds. The analysis was based on the radionuclide concentrations
   reported in four consecutive annual radioecological monitoring reports
   published by French agencies with nuclear regulatory responsibilities.
   The results of this assessment were used to determine, qualitatively,
   the magnitude of any potential health impacts on each of the five
   categories of aquatic organisms studied. The range of dose rate
   estimates ranged over three orders of magnitude, with maximum dose rates
   estimated to be in the order of 1 to 10 mu Gy h(-1). These maximum dose
   rates are a factor 40 or more below the international guideline intended
   to ensure the protection of aquatic populations (about 400 mu Gy h(-1)),
   and a factor ten or more below the level which may trigger the need for
   a more detailed evaluation of potential ecological consequences to the
   exposed populations (about 100 mu Gy h(-1)). As a result, chronic levels
   of radioactivity, artificial and natural, measured in aquatic media
   downstream of Marcoule are unlikely to result in adverse health impacts
   on the categories and species of aquatic organisms studied. Thus, based
   on the screening level analysis discussed in this paper, a more detailed
   evaluation of the dose rates does not appear to be warranted.}},
