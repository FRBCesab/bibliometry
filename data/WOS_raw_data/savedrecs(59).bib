Abstract = {{The long-term decline of the American black duck (Anos rubripes)
   population has been attributed to lower productivity of black ducks that
   might have been excluded from fertile agricultural wetlands by mallards
   (Anas platyrhynchos). We monitored broods on 53 wetlands in 1993 and on
   58 wetlands in 1994 to determine mean brood sizes of black ducks and
   mallards in forested and agricultural landscapes. Study wetlands were
   moderately to highly fertile. We monitored 94 black duck broods each
   year and 46 (1993) and 52 (1994) mallard broods until they reached Class
   IIc-III (near fledging). No differences existed (P = 0.71) in mean brood
   size between black ducks (1993: 3.95 +/- 0.23; 1994: 4.59 +/- 0.24) and
   mallards (1993: 3.96 +/- 0.35; 1994: 5.00 +/- 0.43) either year. Brood
   size for species, however, was different between years (P = 0.014) and
   among wetland sites (P = 0.001). Mean sizes of broods were larger (P <
   0.05) on 2 large impoundment complexes (Lake Josephine and Lake
   Christina) compared with brood sizes on other wetlands in forested or
   agricultural landscapes. No differences (P greater than or equal to
   0.41) existed between mean Class IIc-III brood sizes of black ducks and
   mallards, whether species were alone or together on wetlands. Our data
   document that mallard productivity is similar to that of black ducks
   where they breed sympatrically in Maine.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated whether small predator exclosures might be a useful tool
   for increasing duck recruitment. During a period of increasing drought
   from 1987 to 1991, we monitored populations of dabbling ducks on 9
   51-km(2) study areas, 3 of which contained a centrally located 25-ha
   predator exclosure and 3 of which served as control areas. We did not
   detect an increase in duck pairs per treated area/pairs per control area
   with time (P = 0.37). However, an index to the proportion of females
   nesting in exclosures increased with time for 4 of 5 dabbling duck
   species: mallards (Anas platyrhynchos; P < 0.001), gadwalls (A.
   strepera; P = 0.009), blue-winged teal (A. discors; P = 0.021), and
   northern pintails (A. acuta; P = 0.009). This index did not increase for
   northern shovelers (A. clypeata; P = 0.33). A regression ratio estimate
   of breeding population used in this study produced results similar to
   ratio estimates based on area of land or area of water. Duck populations
   declined on North Dakota study areas as drought increased, but
   populations remained relatively stable on a Minnesota study area. Pair
   numbers were positively related to area of ponds for all species (P =
   0.0001-0.078) and to number of ponds (P = 0.0006-0.014) for all species
   except gadwall (P = 0.35). Area of ponds explained more variation in
   pair numbers than did number of ponds for all species except shovelers,
   As the number of ponds decreased, the number of pairs per pond increased
   for mallards (P = 0.001) and gadwalls (P = 0.004) but not for teal (P =
   0.67)!, shovelers (P = 0.76), or pintails (P = 0.93). Nest densities
   inside exclosures averaged 1.2 nests/ha, and nest success averaged 72\%
   over 5 years, which was substantially higher than in similar habitat
   outside exclosures. Our inability to detect a change in duck pairs per
   treated area/pairs per control area was probably a result of small
   sample size, drought, and variability among study areas. However, the
   increase in proportion of the study area populations nesting inside
   exclosures, as well as high nest success and density inside exclosures.
   suggests that management of a small area can increase duck recruitment
   from a population in a larger surrounding area.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of common eiders (Somateria mollissima) are often conducted in
   winter because elders tend to congregate in small discrete areas during
   this period. Evaluations of population size are usually based on visual
   estimates, the reliability of which is difficult to assess. In winter
   1989, we tested a method of surveying elders in the Mingan Archipelago
   and Anticosti Island region in Quebec. The survey consisted of 2
   consecutive overflights of the study area at high and low altitude where
   photographs were taken and visual estimates were recorded. We estimated
   the size of the population using a 3-step process. First, we estimated
   the number of adult males using a ratio estimator that combined
   high-altitude photo counts and visual estimates; the former was
   considered an accurate count. The ratio of females and immatures to
   adult males was then estimated from photos taken from low altitude.
   Subsequently, a capture-recapture model was used to estimate the number
   of elders in small flocks. The proposed method produced estimates with
   an acceptable level of precision: 77,627 elders (CV = 13\%) on 2
   February and 92,247 elders (CV = 21\%) on 28 February. This precision
   suggests that the method can be useful in monitoring common elder
   populations in winter, thus facilitating the management of this species.
   The proposed methodology is unusual in field biology because sampling
   cannot be controlled; thus, the estimation is relying on a model instead
   of a predefined sampling design.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how overwinter survival of fauns changes as a function of
   density of deer is a critical relation for managing mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus) populations. We examined change in overwinter
   survival of fawns in response to intentional density reduction by
   radiotracking fawns on control and treatment areas. Deer density on the
   treatment area was lowered about 75\%, mostly from antlerless harvests
   in December. There were 7 years of pretreatment data, 4 years of
   harvest, and 3 more rears of posttreatment monitoring. Fawn survival
   rate on the treatment area during the 3 winters after density was
   lowered averaged 0.16 higher (P = 0.001) than the control area. After
   density was lowered, body mass of fawns on the treatment area in
   November-December averaged 0.8 kg more than the control (P < 0.001)!. A
   parallel decline in deer density began on the control area 2 years after
   initiation of the intentional density reduction on the treatment area.
   This decline was unexpected and the cause unknown, which left unanswered
   what the differences in fawn survival and body size between the 2 areas
   might have been if the control population remained high.}},

Abstract = {{The surfaces of most pelagic diatoms are sticky at times and may
   therefore form rapidly settling aggregates by physical coagulation.
   Stickiness and aggregate formation may be particularly adaptive in
   upwelling systems by allowing the retention of diatom populations in the
   vicinity of the upwelling center. We therefore hypothesized that
   upwelling diatom blooms are terminated by aggregate formation and rapid
   sedimentation. We monitored the development of a maturing diatom (mainly
   Chaetoceros spp.) bloom in the Benguela upwelling current during 7 d in
   February. Chlorophyll concentrations remained consistently high during
   the observation period (similar to 500 mg Chi m(-2)) and phytoplankton
   grew at an average specific rate of 0.25 d(-1). The diatoms were
   extraordinarily sticky, with stickiness coefficients of up to 0.40,
   which is the highest ever recorded for field populations. Combined with
   estimates of turbulent shear in the ocean such stickiness coefficients
   predict very high specific coagulation rates (0.3 d(-1)). In situ video
   observation demonstrated the occurrence of abundant diatom aggregates
   with surface water concentrations between 1,000 and 3,000 ppm. Despite
   the very high concentration of aggregates, vertical fluxes of
   phytoplankton were very low, with fractional losses <0.005 d(-1), and
   the aggregates thus seemed to be near neutrally buoyant. Losses due to
   copepod grazing were also low (similar to 0.025 d(-1)). Most of the
   aggregates were colonized by the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca
   scintillans that feed upon diatoms in the aggregates. The system
   appeared to be in near steady state; specific diatom growth rate,
   coagulation rate, and loss rate due to N, scintillans feeding were all
   of the same magnitude (0.25-0.3 d(-1)) and the latter two varied in
   concert. Our observations provide only partial support for the
   population retention hypothesis because aggregate buoyancy and N,
   scintillans grazing efficiently reduced the vertical flux of aggregates
   in this system.}},

Abstract = {{The water quality of Moreton Bay, a sub-tropical estuarine embayment in
   south-eastern Queensland, was monitored over a 2-year period. Surveys in
   situ and ground-truthed satellite imagery were used to describe the
   temporal and spatial variability in water-quality indicators and the
   level of eutrophication. Strong east-west gradients in chlorophyll a and
   water clarity were found. During the study period fluvial discharges,
   which all enter on the western littoral, were below their long-term
   averages, and nutrient loading to the bay was dominated by point-source
   wastewater discharges along the western boundary. The data suggest that
   although the impact of nutrient loads on the bay's eastern side is
   mitigated by tidal intrusion of oceanic water, the western areas are
   already degraded and can be considered mesotrophic to eutrophic. This
   part of the bay may deteriorate further with the projected future
   population expansion in the bay's catchment.}},

Abstract = {{Many high shore marine species are limited in both their distribution
   and behaviour by environmental factors such as high temperature and
   desiccation. High shore limpets show a variety of responses to counter
   physical extremes and are remarkably tolerant of high ionic haemolymph
   concentrations and water loss. Despite this, populations of limpets can
   suffer mass mortalities on hot, calm, days during low water periods in
   Hong Kong. The exact cause of death is uncertain but ionic stress due to
   water loss has been suggested as a likely contributor. In this work we
   tested the hypothesis that either a decrease in haemolymph oxygenation
   and/or an increase in haemolymph acidosis might contribute to mortality
   in a tropical high shore limpet, Cellana grata. Populations of C. grata
   were transplanted from an east facing shore into high stress (horizontal
   rock surfaces; temperatures > 43 degrees C) and reduced stress (vertical
   rock surfaces; temperatures < 35 degrees C) habitats and their
   haemolymph pH and oxygen levels monitored over one daytime emersion
   period. Severely stressed animals showed no decrease in haemolymph
   oxygen levels as compared to less stressed animals but marked acidosis
   (pH 6.8) was observed with progressive exposure and all individuals died
   after 7 hours exposure. Individuals on vertical rock surfaces did not
   suffer any mortality and maintained haemolymph pH and oxygen values at
   similar levels as unstressed animals (individuals actively foraging
   whilst awash by waves at the next high tide). The marked acidosis
   effect, either in isolation or together with osmotic and ion imbalance,
   may contribute to the mass mortalities of Cellana grata associated with
   desiccating conditions in Hong Kong summers.}},

Title = {{Origin and transport of larvae of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus
   (Echinodermata : Echinoidea) in a New Zealand fiord}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{107-121}},
Abstract = {{Larval transport was investigated in a New Zealand fiord by examining
   the reproductive cycles and larval distributions of the sea urchin
   Evechinus chloroticus Valenciennes, and the hydrography in Doubtful
   Sound over 2 sampling periods (SP). These were from 27 September 1993 to
   24 March 1994 (SP1993/94) and 27 October 1994 to 11 May 1995
   (SP1994/95). Reproductive cycles of E. chloroticus were monitored at
   2-weekly or monthly intervals in 3 populations in the fiord, while the
   transport and development of larvae were examined by plankton sampling
   every 2 wk at 4 permanent stations inside the fiord, and 1 permanent
   station outside. To determine water exchange in Doubtful Sound, an S4
   current meter was deployed at the entrance of the fiord at 15 m depth.
   The fiord has an estuarine circulation pattern with a thin low salinity
   surface layer flowing seaward, below which is a compensatory landward
   flow of seawater. A major, synchronous spawning of E. chloroticus was
   observed during SP1993/94 which produced a widespread, single cohort of
   larvae throughout the fiord. In SP1994/95, spawning was fractional and
   asynchronous and resulted in 2 cohorts of larvae during the summer.
   Larval densities were an order of magnitude higher during SP1993/94
   (2743.0 larvae tow(-1)) than in SP1994/95 (155.3 larvae tow(-1)). E.
   chloroticus larval distribution patterns indicate that there was a high
   level of larval retention within the fiord, consistent with the
   estuarine circulation pattern. During SP1993/94, average larval
   densities 4 wk after spawning ranged from 65.3 to 461.0 larvae tow(-1)
   within the fiord, compared to an average of 2.0 larvae tow(-1) at the
   outer site. Similarly, during SP1994/95 larval densities were
   consistently higher within Doubtful Sound than at the outer site. Larvae
   completed development within 4 to 6 wk in Doubtful Sound. These results
   suggest that recruitment of E. chloroticus in Doubtful Sound is by
   larvae that have originated, been retained and completed development
   within the fiord. Reduced larval exchange provides a mechanism for
   observed genetic differentiation of this population.}},

Abstract = {{I monitored the size composition, abundance, growth, reproductive
   biomass and productivity characteristics of Euphausia pacifica in
   Barkley Sound, Canada, from March 1991 through March 1997. Sea
   temperatures were anomalously warm in 1992 (El Nino Southern
   Oscillation, ENSO) and in 1993; the strongest upwelling over the study
   period occurred in 1992. Mean annual E. pacifica larval abundance was 6
   times greater in 1992 than in 1991, the pre-ENSO year. Adult abundance
   in 1992 and 1993 was twice that for 1991 due to the strong recruitment
   moving through the population. Larval abundance fluctuated substantially
   since the warming while adult abundance returned to pre-ENSO levels in
   1994. Growth conditions, as indicated by variations in the condition
   factor, did not vary significantly over the 6 yr study period.
   Length-at-maturity increased over the spawning season but interannual
   variations were too small to influence adult abundance. The sex ratio
   fluctuated randomly around a grand mean of 0.56 males within and between
   years. I present a procedure for defining spawning events as a function
   of larval development time and its variability. I found a number of
   discrete spawnings annually and suggest that there has been no change in
   spawning frequency or duration over the study period. I found no
   significant change in the size of any larval stage over the study
   period. The relationship between parental and larval abundance follows a
   Ricker stock-recruit relationship; larval abundance decreased at high
   parental abundances. Mean annual larval biomass and productivity (growth
   + moult) ranged from being the same as to 9 times greater than 1991
   levels. Mean,adult biomass was 1.2 and 2 times greater in 1992 and 1993
   respectively than in 1991; productivity was 1.8 and 2.3 times higher in
   1992 and 1993 respectively and has returned to pre-ENSO levels. P:B
   ratios for total production ranged from 55 to 89 and from 8.6 to 12.4
   for larvae and adults respectively. Population P:B ratios fluctuated
   between 10.7 and 23.3.}},

Abstract = {{I monitored the population structure, abundance and growth, as well as
   the reproductive and production characteristics of Thysanoessa spinifera
   in Barkley Sound from March 1991 through March 1997. The years 1992 and
   1993 were anomalously warm, 1992 due to an El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO). Summer upwelling was particularly strong in 1992 and downwelling
   in the winter of 1994-95. Mean annual larval (<10 mm) abundance was 2.4,
   0.6, 0.4, 6.3 and 1.9 times greater in 1992 through 1996 respectively
   than in 1991. Adult abundance declined steadily since 1991 and in 1996
   was about 0.14 of the pre-ENSO levels. Growth conditions, as indicated
   by the condition factor, varied seasonally but not interannually. There
   were no apparent interannual differences in length-at-maturity sex ratio
   and spawning season length. I found no apparent relationship between
   parental and larval abundances. Indications are that the number of
   spawnings declined as of 1993. Mean annual larval biomass fluctuated.
   Biomass ranged between 0.19 (1994) and 6.9 (1996) times the 1991 value.
   Total production (growth + moult) was between 0.24 (1994) and 4.9 (1996)
   the 1991 value. Adult biomass and productivity fell continuously after
   1991 and, in 1996, were about 0.13 of the pre-warm ocean years.
   Population P:B ratios fluctuated between 14.4 and 44.7, with the highest
   ratio in 1996.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal patterns of larval abundance, recruitment and early
   mortality in the sea urchin Paracentrotus Lividus (Lamarck) in the
   northwestern Mediterranean were studied by combining planktonic and
   benthic surveys. The abundance of planktonic stages was monitored by
   weekly plankton hauls from 1992 to 1996. The presence of juveniles was
   studied by collecting epibenthic samples at monthly intervals from 1992
   to 1995. The size distribution of the same population was studied in
   1993. A main recruitment episode in late spring-summer occurred every
   year, although small recruitment events had been observed in autumn and
   winter. Interannual variability in larval abundance and recruitment was
   high, both being most intense in 1992, when up to 33.47 larvae m(-3)
   were recorded in plankton samples, and up to 23000 recruits (sea urchins
   <2 mm) m(-2) were found in the benthic samples. We estimated that only
   about 12.7\% of larvae (from the a-armed stage onwards) survived the
   planktonic Life, and that 0.5 to 0.7\% of the settlers survived until
   they reached a diameter of 2 mm, while 0.040\% of settlers survived the
   first year of benthic life and only 0.028\% of settlers may attain
   reproductive size. The main bottlenecks in the dynamics of this species
   occurred, therefore, during the planktonic phase and the first year of
   benthic existence, particularly during the early post-settlement phase.
   The benthic samples provided a more robust depiction of events than
   planktonic data, which featured a higher variability. There was a
   significant relationship between the interannual variation in the late
   winter phytoplankton bloom and the spring peak of larvae of this
   species, indicating that changes in larval abundance are coherent with
   changes in planktonic primary production. There was also an exponential
   negative relationship between the abundance of larvae and abundance of
   recruits relative to larvae over the years studied, indicating
   density-dependent mortality rates in the planktonic and early benthic
   stages. Successful cohorts of this species can be traced to years with
   high larval abundance, which in turn are related to episodes of high
   planktonic primary production.}},

Abstract = {{The embryonic development of the deposit-feeding Baltic amphipod
   Monoporeia affinis (Lindstrom) was studied from fertilization to
   hatching. Severe types of aberrant embryonic development are described
   and the normal variation of the aberrations is estimated. Between 2 and
   6\% malformed, 0 and 5\% undifferentiated and 0 and 6\% dead eggs and
   embryos were observed at different sites in the coastal area of the
   northern Baltic proper and the Bothnian Sea without local contaminant
   discharges. The embryonic development of M. affinis was described to
   facilitate the use of the embryo Variables in field studies of sediment
   toxicity. The merits of the different embryo variables as biomarkers in
   effect monitoring were evaluated. Gravid females were sampled in the
   receiving waters of 2 different types of pulp mills and an aluminum
   smeltery. Fecundity (eggs per female) and frequency of malformed,
   enlarged, undifferentiated and dead embryos per female were determined.
   Frequency of malformed embryos was higher at industrially affected
   stations as compared to reference areas (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001. and p =
   0.003 respectively). The highest frequencies (15.3\%) were recorded
   close to the aluminum smeltery. In reference areas the frequency varied
   between 1.5 and 4.9. The number of enlarged embryos with oedema was
   higher near the pulp mills (p = 0.03, p > 0.0001), particularly the pulp
   mill with a bleaching stage, where 25 to 40\% embryos per female were
   affected. Background frequencies of enlarged embryos (0.7 to 3.5\%) were
   observed outside the aluminum smeltery. Undifferentiated eggs and dead
   eggs did not correlate to the exposure situation, suggesting these
   variables are of limited value in effect monitoring of xenobiotics. The
   frequency of malformed embryos was increased also when fecundity,
   reproduction success and developmental stage of embryos were unaffected.
   Thus, the variable is suggested to be particularly toxicant-sensitive
   and by analysing the number of malformed embryos of M. affinis an early
   warning of affected populations could be provided.}},

Abstract = {{Blooms of the noxious red tide phytoplankton Heterosigma akashiwo
   (Raphidophyceae) occurred in Hiroshima Bay, Japan, in 1994 and 1995.
   During these blooms we monitored microorganisms which killed H, akashiwo
   by use of the microplate MPN (most probable number) method using an
   axenic culture of H, akashiwo as a susceptible host organism. At every
   sampling site abundance of algicidal microorganisms in seawater samples
   filtered through 0.8 mu m nuclepore filters increased rapidly during the
   termination period of each bloom. However, the number of algicidal
   microorganisms in seawater samples filtered through 0.2 mu m nuclepore
   filters was less abundant and correlated poorly with the extinction of
   H. akashiwo blooms. The latter samples were assumed to indicate viral
   activity. Thus, ii is possible that H. akashiwo-killing bacteria (HAKB)
   played a more dominant role in the termination of the blooms in 1994 and
   1995 in Hiroshima Bay than viruses. The number of algicidal bacteria
   targeting Chattonella antiqua (Raphidophyceae), which was not detected
   during the investigation period, was 1 or 2 orders of magnitude lower
   than that of HAKB. We isolated some HAKB strains capable of causing
   mortality in H, akashiwo. These results suggest that the population
   dynamics of algicidal bacteria has a close relationship to the blooms of
   the phytoplankton, and that, in marine ecosystems, algicidal bacteria
   targeting specific phytoplankton may be one of the agents which regulate
   the change of species structure of phytoplankton communities.}},

Title = {{Do climatic oscillations influence cyclical patterns of soft bottom

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{85-94}},
Abstract = {{Soft sediment macrofauna has been monitored at 10 stations (10 to 300 m)
   off the west coast of Sweden for periods of 12 to 20 yr. Macrobenthic
   abundance and biomass in this region show a distinct cyclical pattern of
   approximately 7 to 8 yr. Macrobenthic oscillation patterns down to 100 m
   depth are generally in phase, suggesting a causative mechanism operating
   at a regional scale. At the 300 m deep station, the cycles did not
   appear to be in phase with the stations in shallower water. Spectral
   analysis of the 130 yr record of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
   index indicated that the dominant component of the index occurred at a
   period of 7.9 yr. The NAO index over the period 1970 to 1990 was
   significantly positively correlated with Skagerrak deep water (600 m)
   temperature and significantly negatively correlated with stream flow
   from western Sweden. Stream flow was significantly positively correlated
   with benthic abundance and biomass at stations down to 100 m depth, but
   negatively correlated with bottom water oxygen content. We therefore
   propose that climatological linkages affecting primarily surface primary
   production result in bottom-up control of benthic population changes. We
   suggest that climatic variability in the region may be a more basic
   causative factor for benthic disturbance than eutrophication and other
   possible factors which have previously been proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional wisdom suggests that pelagically borne marine invertebrate
   larvae are dispersed considerable distances from their source
   population, but recent research provides evidence that at least in some
   instances larvae may be retained within the local environment. From June
   1995 through June 1996, we monitored adult abundance and juvenile
   recruitment in 4 geographically separated bay scallop Argopecten
   irradians populations occurring along the Gulf of Mexico coast of
   Florida, USA. Populations at our Anclote and Homosassa study sites had
   low adult abundances (generally <5 scallops per 600 m(2) survey
   transect) during 1995 and 1996, whereas populations at our Steinhatchee
   and St. Joseph Bay study sites had considerably higher adult abundances
   (generally >25 scallops per 600 m(2) survey transect) during those
   years. Similarly, recruitment to artificial spat collectors was a rare
   event at Anclote and Homosassa, where we typically collected fewer than
   0.1 scallops per collector per day. In contrast, recruits were common at
   Steinhatchee and St. Joseph Bay, where daily recruitment rates exceeded
   those observed at Anclote and Homosassa by 1.5 to 2 orders of magnitude.
   Whereas differences in adult abundance and juvenile recruitment were
   pronounced among sites, differences among stations within each site were
   minor and generally not significant. Based upon these observations and
   knowledge of the distribution and abundance of bay scallops in Floridan
   Gulf of Mexico waters, our results suggest that during 1995-96,
   dispersal of bay scallop larvae was widespread within each study site
   but that transport of larvae away from the adult habitat was uncommon
   and ultimately unsuccessful. We discuss oceanographic features that may
   support local retention of bay scallop larvae along the west coast of
   Florida, and we suggest that periodic interruptions of those
   oceanographic processes may explain the previously reported genetic
   homogeneity among bay scallop populations in Florida.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1998}},

Pages = {{289-293}},
Abstract = {{Settlement abundances of barnacles are determined by larval supply and
   the ratio of settlement to larval supply (K). This ratio can be divided
   into 2 functions: the ratio of settlement on bare space to larval supply
   (k(1)), and the loss of cyprids due to the preempting of rock space by
   sessile organisms (k(2)). To examine the 3 functions of settlement (i.e.
   larval supply, k(1) and k(2)) of the barnacle Semibalanus cariosus, we
   monitored the daily water column larval supply and the daily settlement
   density in plots where all benthos were removed and in natural-community
   plots, which were left undisturbed, during one settling season. In both
   low- and mid-tidal sites, k(1) explained > 75 \% of day-to-day
   variability in K, k(1) and k(2) were density dependent, while daily
   settlement densities were Linearly related to larval supply, k(1) varied
   with tidal height and daily larval supply, but not with other physical
   variables. k(2) varied with daily settlement densities in
   community-removal plots and was not related to any physical or
   biological variable. Such density dependence in k(1) and k(2) may have
   been caused by 3 processes: (1) inhibition of larval settlement by
   planktonic larvae, (2) enhancement of settlement by conspecifics (and
   their chemical attractants) on days with relatively low larval density,
   and/or (3) preemption of suitable settlement substrata by settlers that
   attached on days with relatively high larval density.}},

Title = {{Temporal variability in abundance of the sea urchins Paracentrotus

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1998}},

Abstract = {{Sea urchin populations were monitored in the Medes Islands Marine
   Reserve (NW Mediterranean) and an adjacent unprotected area in order to
   (1) describe temporal variability in abundance and population
   size-structure of sea urchins within each area (from 1991 to 1997), and
   (2) to compare these areas to investigate the role of fish predation
   level in determining sea urchin population structure over time (from
   1995 to 1997). Abundance of the sea urchin Paracentrotus Lividus
   (Lamarck) was monitored at 7 sites (4 inside and 3 outside the reserve),
   and 2 distinct habitats (fields of big boulders and vertical walls). P.
   Lividus exhibited significant variability in density over time on
   boulders, both inside and outside the reserve, whereas its density did
   not vary significantly on vertical walls. P. lividus populations
   differed significantly in size-structure across sites, varying from
   unimodal to bimodal among sites and years. Density and mean size of P.
   lividus were not significantly different between the protected and the
   unprotected area in either of the 2 habitats. Abundance of the sea
   urchin Arbacia lixula (L.) was monitored from 1995 to 1997 on vertical
   walls and boulders (4 sites inside and 3 sites outside the reserve).
   Density of A. lixula differed significantly over time on boulders, but
   it did not on walls. On vertical walls, density and mean size of A.
   lixula were not significantly different between areas in both habitats.
   This study shows that in the Medes Islands region, sea urchins exhibit
   striking short-term fluctuations in abundance, which can lead to
   misinterpretation of larger-scale temporal patterns. The comparison
   between the protected and the unprotected area does not support the
   hypothesis of fish predation as the most important factor affecting P.
   lividus populations in the Medes Islands, as patterns of lower sea
   urchin density relative to the unprotected area nearby were not
   maintained over time. These facts indicate that factors other than fish
   predation are very important in determining sea urchin population

Abstract = {{Present automated systems for counting and measuring marine plankton
   include flow cytometers and in situ plankton video recorders. Neither of
   these approaches are optimal for the microplankton cells which range in
   size from 20 to 200 mu m and can be fewer than 10(4) l(-1). We describe
   here an instrument designed for rapid counting, imaging and measuring of
   individual cells and particles in the microplankton size range from
   cultures and natural populations. It uses a unique optical element to
   extend the depth of focus of the imaging lens, allowing a sample stream
   flow rate of 1 ml min(-1) The instrument stores a digital image of each
   particle along with real time fluorescence and size measurements. An
   interactive cytogram links a dot-plot of the size and fluorescence data
   to the stored cell images, allowing rapid characterization of
   populations. We have tested the system on live phytoplankton cultures
   and bead standards, proving the system counting and sizing accuracy and
   precision. The system provides images and size distributions for
   cultures or natural marine samples. It has been used successfully at sea
   to continuously monitor particles while underway. It may prove useful in
   studies of plankton community structure, ocean optics and monitoring for
   harmful algal species.}},

Title = {{How do reproductive output, larval behaviour, and recruitment contribute
   to adult spatial patterns in Mediterranean encrusting sponges?}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{137-148}},
Abstract = {{We studied the abundance and spatial pattern of 2 Mediterranean
   encrusting sponges, Crambe crambe (highly toxic) and Scopalina
   lophyropoda (non-toxic), at 4 spatial scales (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 m(2)). We
   also examined the reproductive output, larval behaviour and recruitment
   in these species, and assessed the relative importance of these
   parameters in explaining the abundance and spatial patterns of adults.
   We also determined, in field experiments, whether the presence of adults
   induces or inhibits recruitment in these 2 species. We found that C.
   crambe was much more abundant than S. lophyropoda at the site studied in
   both number of individuals per m(2) (67 +/- 2.7 vs 10.2 +/- 2.1, mean
   +/- SE) and coverage (47 +/-. 1.9 vs 11.1 +/- 1.4 \%). At the smallest
   scale sampled (0.5 m(2)), both species showed an aggregated pattern.
   Aggregation was also detected for S. lophyropoda, but not for C, crambe,
   at the scales of 1 and 2 m(2). The number of embryos incubated per cm(2)
   by C. crambe and S. lophyropoda was 76.2 +/- 12.5 and 14 +/- 1.7 (mean
   +/- SE), respectively. We estimated that the potential number of larvae
   of C, crambe released into the water column was about 20 times higher
   than that of S. lophyropoda. Larval behaviour was monitored in the
   laboratory and in the field. Larvae of S. lophyropoda did not swim away
   from the release point. They maintained a vertical posture that
   minimised horizontal dispersal, and soon began crawling. In contrast,
   the larvae of C. crambe swam actively and had a comparatively delayed
   crawling phase. Recruitment of the 2 species in scraped quadrats
   surrounded by individuals of C. crambe and S. lophyropoda, and in
   controls (rocky areas with no sponges), was monitored weekly for a
   month. Recruitment of both species was higher in scraped quadrats
   surrounded by conspecifics. This effect was notably more marked for S.
   lophyropoda than for C, crambe recruits. The toxicity of C. crambe did
   not inhibit settlement of S. lophyropoda with respect to controls. The
   mean number of recruits per unit surface area after 1 mo (all substrates
   pooled) was ca 3.5 limes higher for C. crambe than for S, lophyropoda.
   This difference was smaller than expected given that larval production
   of C. crambe was ca 20 times higher. This indicates that a significant
   proportion of C. crambe's offspring did not contribute to the
   maintenance of the local population. The aggregated pattern of S0
   lophyropoda at scales ranging from 0.5 to 2 m(2) and its discontinuous
   geographic distribution may be partially explained by strong phylopatry
   of its larvae due to their poor swimming ability and limited dispersal.
   The dominance of C, crambe in littoral assemblages, its random
   distribution at scales larger than 0.5 m(2), and its ubiquity along the
   Littoral are traits that are consistent with high reproductive output,
   the swimming behaviour of larvae which facilitates wide dispersal, and
   patterns of recruitment found in this study. Therefore, S. lophyropoda
   populations appear to be maintained by offspring supplied by
   autochthonous individuals while populations of C. crambe appear to be
   open, with a potentially significant flow of larvae between them.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the population size-structure and demography of the
   intertidal kelp Hedophyllum sessile (C. Agardh) Setchell in areas of
   manipulated chiton Katharina tunicata (Wood) density to examine
   size-related `escapes' and other mechanisms which may underlie the
   effects of this herbivore on H, sessile. This research was done on the
   west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We find that
   K. tunicata is associated with decreased juvenile H, sessile (<1 cm
   holdfast diameter) survivorship. While young adults of H, sessile (1-4
   cm holdfast diameter) were found to survive significantly longer than
   juveniles between areas of low, control and high chiton density, adult
   (>4 cm holdfast diameter) survivorship did not differ among the density
   treatments. We argue that the mechanism underlying the effect of K,
   tunicata on young adult H. sessile survivorship is an indirect
   interaction wherein holdfast integrity is degraded, resulting in an
   increased susceptibility to wave-induced mortality. These findings
   provide a quantification of the mechanism of macrophyte size-escapes,
   may explain the geographically variable effects of K, tunica ta and bold
   implications for studies which aim to assess the effects of wave
   exposure on macrophyte survivorship.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the structure of benthic invertebrate communities in
   undisturbed and experimentally cleared quadrats on 3 rocky shores on the
   east coast of South Africa were monitored quarterly for 14 yr from 1982.
   There were no clear long-term trends in species diversity in either
   undisturbed or experimentally cleared areas. Diversity decreased and
   became more variable following disturbance and remained so throughout
   the study. Fourier analyses revealed significant annual cycles in
   diversity in undisturbed areas at all sites, while only half of the
   cleared areas exhibited significant annual cycles. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling ordinations, based on Bray-Curtis similarity
   matrices, were used to represent, traces of the `state' of the community
   through time at each site. Undisturbed areas typically exhibited 2 or
   more apparently stable states, persisting for periods exceeding the
   turnover time of the dominant populations, with brief periods of
   instability between them. Fluctuations in the abundance of barnacles and
   periwinkles accounted for most of the differences between these states.
   The lower balanoid zone community tended to oscillate between states
   more frequently than that in the upper balanoid zone. Correlations
   between traces from different sites tended to be stronger for high shore
   communities than for those lower on the shore. Disturbed communities
   either converged to a stable state, persisting for more than 10 yr, or
   remained unstable throughout the study. Similarities in long-term
   variability between sites suggest the influence of large-scale factors
   affecting the supply and survival of larvae.}},

Title = {{Production, settlement, and survival of plexaurid gorgonian recruits}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{111-123}},
Abstract = {{Observed recruitment rates among benthic invertebrates reflect a cascade
   of events that starts with the production of gametes and includes
   fertilization, settlement and the mortality that occurs shortly after
   settlement. Although recruitment rates are commonly measured, studies
   that include the steps leading to recruitment are relatively rare.
   Fecundity, fertilization rates, larval supply, post-settlement mortality
   and annual recruitment of the clonal gorgonian Plexaura kuna were
   determined for a population in the San Bias Islands, Panama. Fecundity
   of colonies was determined by enumerating the eggs contained within
   polyps of female colonies and from the number of eggs released in
   aquaria by colony explants. On average, colonies released 23.2 eggs
   cm(-1) of branch length. Polyps on second order branches contained more
   eggs than those on primary or tertiary branches. Extrapolation of egg
   release data as well as the density of eggs in the water column during
   spawning suggests that genets, which may contain 10(2) colonies, can
   produce 10(6) to 10(7) eggs annually. Only 1 planula was observed in a
   total of 40 settlement traps that were sampled weekly during June and
   July 1989. To assess post-settlement survival, planulae of P. kuna were
   reared and allowed to settle on 40 seasoned Plexiglas plates which were
   then returned to the reef. Mortality during the first 2 wk on the reef
   was 60\%. Survivorship was greatest on the most protected section of the
   PIexiglas plates, and when the entire settlement plate was floated above
   the substratum and away from benthic grazers. Monthly recruitment of P.
   kuna was monitored in 2 m(2) areas at 3 sites between June 1986 and July
   1988. Few recruits were observed and all died within several months of
   their appearance in the survey areas. Annual recruitment was followed in
   230 m(2) during 1984 to 1996. At one site, P. kuna recruits were not
   observed, and at the other 2 sites, recruitment rates were 0.04 and
   0.002 m(-2) yr(-1). Extrapolations of colony production rates, clone
   size, and post-settlement survival suggest that recruitment is most
   sensitive to survival of larvae in the water column and survival of
   newly settled individuals. The 3-fold difference in mortality rates on
   different areas of the settlement plates leads to a 100-fold difference
   in recruitment. Although recruitment rates are low when considered on an
   annual basis, clonal propagation, which extends genet lifespan over many
   decades, dramatically increases the likelihood of successful settlement
   over the Lifespan of colonies and genets.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury concentrations in the hair and various tissues of the Saimaa
   ringed seal were monitored from 1980 to 1995, In the liver, muscle and
   kidney of weaned pups mercury concentrations dropped in the middle of
   the 1980s. In the natal hair and liver of young pups, however, no clear
   decrease was seen. In the natal hair and main fish prey species of the
   seals mercury concentration were highest in areas of humic water.
   Mercury concentration in the liver of adults has not changed
   significantly since 1981. Age of the seal is clearly correlated with
   mercury concentration in the liver. Shortage of selenium is assumed to
   be one reason for high concentrations of mercury in muscle. The mercury
   concentration in hair decreased markedly in an adult seal in captivity,
   after giving selenium, Based on these findings, one reason for the
   decrease in population density of the Saimaa seal in this century may
   have been mercury pollution, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Watershed management projects, especially in developing countries under
   pressures of rising populations, present peculiar challenges in design
   and evaluation, because they aim to produce specific physical outcomes
   through socio-economic actions. Efforts to reduce human-induced soil
   losses, without displacing the relevant communities, need time and
   persistence, because such efforts must involve persuasion, rather than
   direction, of the communities towards both different styles of
   socio-economic behaviour and new land-use practices. In tropical and
   subtropical environments, several encouraging successes in
   community-based projects of this kind have been reported over the last
   10-15 years. Such projects address multiple goals: reducing soil loss,
   increasing dry-season flows, reducing floods as well as improving the
   economic value of land and livelihood of people. Therefore, such
   projects must be multi-dimensional and multidisciplinary, acid these
   considerations have time and cost implications. In these circumstances,
   evaluation of project packages is necessary though difficult. Developing
   better insights into the benefit-cost effects of their various
   characteristic components would be valuable. Identifying and quantifying
   intermediate benefit targets are desirable, since the apparently slow
   rate of delivery of intended ultimate benefits may lead to ``fatigue{''}
   and weakening of support from funding agencies; this, in turn, can lead
   to some displacement of objectives, or to substitution of more modest
   objectives. Persistence of funding support may, on the other hand, be
   enhanced by establishing programmes of continuous evaluation, internal
   to such projects. This paper discusses the methodologies of monitoring
   and evaluation programmes that focus primarily on measuring the physical
   results that are due to promoting socio-economic actions and adjustments
   of land-use behaviour within the community.}},

Abstract = {{The productivity of agroecosystems and their vulnerability to
   environmental degradation are both determined by the very same
   fundamental factors, processes, and constraints. These may be climatic,
   topographic, soil-based, or a consequence of selected land use and
   applied management. This commonality strongly argues for compatibility,
   rather than conflict, between production-driven and environmental
   objectives of agricultural land use. However, the increasingly intensive
   use of ``productive lands{''} and ever-increasing encroachment upon
   ``marginal lands{''} to meet the needs of exploding human populations
   have led to increasing conflicts between these sets of objectives. Even
   so, it is our hypothesis that the objectives are less likely to clash if
   certain conditions are met in the planning and management of land and
   natural resources for agriculture. These conditions include assuring
   comprehensive ex ante accounting of the likely changes in the ecosystem
   as a consequence of development; conducting the planning,
   implementation, and evaluation of land use systems at meaningful spatial
   and temporal scales; maximizing the match between site attributes, the
   planned land use, and applied management; emphasizing the increased use
   efficiency of externally added, production-boosting inputs; defining
   meaningful objective indicators and realistic thresholds for judging
   changes in the agroecosystem's productive capacity and impact on
   environmental quality; monitoring these indicators for regular ex post
   evaluations of project performance upon implementation; and making
   judicious use of available data, models, geographic information systems,
   and decision aids for selecting sustainable land uses and designing
   environmentally sound management. Multicriteria analyses allow
   definition of the most critical bottlenecks to sustainable land use and
   can lead to designing quantitative decision aids for optimizing
   management. Such decision aids need not be complex. Rather, systems of
   varying complexity are necessary for meeting the needs of various
   clientele and the many diverse levels of decision making.}},

Abstract = {{This century has seen a rapid growth in water demand due to increasing
   use of water in irrigated food production and industry and increased per
   capita use for domestic purposes. between 1900 and 1995, water
   withdrawals increased by a factor of over six, more than double the rate
   of population growth, increased demands are causing water stress in many
   areas of the world, to the extent that nearly 10\% of the world's
   population live in countries using so much of their water resources that
   they can be considered to be highly water stressed. Under the current
   patterns of water use, an estimated two thirds of the total world
   population may well face water stress by the year 2025, A comprehensive
   review of the world's freshwater resources has underlined the need to
   move water issues higher up the environmental management and political
   agenda, and to upgrade capabilities for monitoring and assessing the
   world's water resources.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the use of vetch or fallow in rotation with cereals on
   the dynamics of nematode populations was studied in a field experiment
   conducted on a luvisol in Central Spain. All the nematodes present in
   the trial were monitored by seasonal samplings for three consecutive
   years, starting one year after the first rotation cycle was completed.
   Vetch in rotation with cereals controlled sail populations of some virus
   transmitters (Xiphinema pachtaicum and Trichodorus sp.) and the cyst
   nematode Heterodera avenae. Fallow also controlled X. pachtaicum and H.
   avenae, as well as Pratylenchus thornei, Ditylenchus dipsaci,
   Tylenchorhynchus maximus and Tylenchus sp. Other Dorylaimidae and
   Rhabditidae species seemed to be influenced by vetch and fallow only
   indirectly. Neither rotation influenced Longidorus profundorum
   populations. The maturity index based on the nematode fauna was used as
   a measure of the disturbance in this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on water systems are of
   rapidly growing concern within the field of environmental sciences and
   management, Most studies have focused on mixture toxicity and have dealt
   with responses of biota at either organismal or population level. Few
   studies have addressed responses of organisms exposed to combinations of
   chemical and physical stressors. Although antagonistic, additive and
   synergistic effects have been described for exposure of biota to
   combinations of chemical stressors, it seems to be agreed that
   concentration addition proves to be a reasonable worst case estimation.
   Therefore, aggregation of physico-chemical parameters in water quality
   indices and supplementary specifications of environmental quality
   objectives to account for mixture toxicity are generally based on
   concentration addition.
   In spite of a growing interest in multiple stressors, basic data are
   often lacking or inadequate to allow precise predictions of the
   cumulative impacts of multiple stressors at the ecosystem level. Even in
   the long term, investigation of all probable ecotoxicological responses
   to exposure to all possible combinations of stressors does not seem
   practically or economically feasible. Monitoring of a sophisticated
   combination of physico-chemical, and biological parameters improves
   detection and ecotoxicological risk assessment of multiple stressors.
   Application of quantitative structure-activity relationships, algorithms
   for mixture toxicity of known substances, (bio)chemical group parameters
   and response-oriented sum parameters may reduce uncertainties of
   cumulative impact assessment and can improve water quality management.}},

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1998}},

Pages = {{25-31}},
Abstract = {{Flowering intensity and plant size were monitored in 155 Festuca
   novae-zelandiae individuals over four years to determine if trade-offs
   exist between inflorescence production and vegetative growth, and
   between inflorescence production in different years. Less than half of
   the population flowered in any one year, 36\% of individuals did not
   flower at all, and only 17\% flowered in all four years of the study.
   Mean number of inflorescences per individual per year varied from 1.54
   to 5.53 (maximum = 85). No trade-offs were detected between flowering
   frequency and intensity; individuals that flowered more frequently also
   produced more inflorescences in each flowering episode. No trade-off was
   detected between current and future reproduction, rather flowering
   intensity was positively correlated between years. Growth, as measured
   by diameter increment, was positively related to flowering frequency and
   flowering intensity, both across all individuals studied and within 1m x
   1m plots. The presence of a positive relationship between growth and
   reproduction within plots argues against meso-scale variability in
   environment factors being the cause of the results from analyses
   involving all individuals. Clearly reproduction in F. novae-zelandiae
   does not incur a marked cost in growth or future reproduction. The
   assumptions underlying theoretical expectations of such trade-offs may
   not be valid for long-lived clonal plants such as F. novae-zelandiae.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of root-associated
   diazotrophic rhizobacteria and Azolla, alone and in combinations, on
   rice grown in a flooded saline soil. N-15 labelled ammonium sulphate at
   the rate of 30 kg N/ha was used to monitor its recovery and computation
   of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) using an isotopic dilution method.
   The bacterial population of nitrogen-fixing bacteria generally increased
   more for inoculated treatments compared with uninoculated ones. The rice
   biomass (straw + grain) was maximum for Azolla cover followed by the
   bacterial treatment. The fertilizer-N recovery in rice was maximum for
   Azolla cover + bacteria followed by Azolla cover treatment, which may be
   due to lowering of floodwater pH by Azolla. The maximum amount of BNF
   (46 kg N/ha) was obtained for bacterial treatment, followed by bacteria
   + Azolla incorporated treatment. The study indicated that use of
   biofertilizers, along with a low input of chemical-N fertilizer, is
   useful for increasing rice yield, fertilizer-N use efficiency and BNF in
   rice grown in flooded soil conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggested that differences in age at maturity among
   populations of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were not
   genetically based, but rather were a phenotypic response to the presence
   of predators. I conducted two experiments to determine if the presence
   of largemouth bass affected age at maturity in bluegill sunfish.
   Bluegills from three populations were tested to see if the response to
   the threat of predation varied among source populations. Juvenile
   bluegills were maintained in the presence of predators or in controls
   with no contact with predators. Refuge use and growth were monitored
   during the experiments and reproductive activity was evaluated when
   bluegills reached age 1. Bluegills from one population exhibited delayed
   maturity in the presence of predators. Individuals from the other two
   populations showed no significant differences between predator and
   control treatments. The population that responded to the presence of
   predators had a history of high predation levels over the past 30-40
   years. The other populations had a history of low levels of predation.
   This study suggests that presence of predators can induce phenotypic
   shifts in age at maturity of bluegills, but that the magnitude of
   response varies among populations in a manner consistent with historical
   patterns of coexistence.}},

Abstract = {{I examine how dispersal of juvenile creek chubs (Semotilus
   atromaculatus) from beaver ponds into adjacent stream environments
   interacts with temporal abiotic variability to influence fish foraging,
   growth, and long-term persistence in the lotic ecosystem. Minnow
   trapping in upstream and downstream beaver ponds, along with weir traps
   used to monitor directional movement, indicated that most chubs
   colonized the stream from the downstream beaver pond. Large annual
   fluctuations in density of age 0 creek chubs occurred in the stream over
   a 10-year sampling period. Multiple regression analysis indicated that
   stream temperature, precipitation, and the density of reproductive creek
   chubs were not correlated with summer density of age 0 chubs in the
   stream. The factor most strongly associated with increased density of
   age 0 creek chubs was creation of the downstream beaver pond during the
   6th-7th years of the study, suggesting dispersal from the pond was the
   primary factor determining age 0 fish density in the stream. Most
   individuals in the strong year classes neither persisted in the stream
   through their first winter nor resulted in an increased abundance of
   older age classes in later years. Comparison of age 0 fish density in
   summer to the proportion of fish surviving to age 1 in spring suggested
   that overwinter mortality was density dependent. Furthermore, a
   comparison of the size structure for age 0 individuals in summer to age
   1 individuals the following spring indicated that winter mortality was
   size dependent. Experiments in an artificial stream adjacent to the
   natural channel revealed that fish growth was strongly density
   dependent, decreasing as fish density increased across both spring and
   summer, and elevated and low discharge. The decline in invertebrate prey
   captured by the fish and the subsequent decline in fish growth appeared
   to be particularly pronounced under low discharge in summer. Changes in
   juvenile creek chub density had no significant effect on benthic insect
   or crustacean abundance, suggesting that exploitative competition for
   limited invertebrate drift resources was a more important cause of
   density-dependent growth than depressed local benthic invertebrate
   abundance. These results suggest that lotic regions adjacent to beaver
   ponds act as potential reproductive ``sinks{''} for dispersing juveniles
   confronting seasonal and flow-mediated restrictions on resource
   acquisition and growth, and the occurrence of seasonal bottlenecks to
   their survival, especially harsh winter conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Decreasing populations of farmland birds have been reported throughout
   NW Europe. This study aims at identifying habitat elements of importance
   for the maintenance of a rich avifauna in agricultural areas. Using data
   from the Danish breeding birds monitoring programme, based on point
   counts, 706 census points situated in farmland and censused during the
   years 1990-1993 were selected. The landscape around each point was
   described quantitatively with respect to general habitat composition,
   area and structure of habitat islands, and length and structure of
   linear habitat elements. Bird-habitat relationships were analysed by
   means of canonical correlation analysis and multiple regression. The
   number of species was negatively correlated with distance to permanent
   grassland, wetland and wood, and positively correlated with area of
   buildings and gardens, dry habitat islands (coverts) and wet habitat
   islands with woody plants. A number of associations between individual
   species and habitat elements were found and are described in the paper.
   Two major species groups may be distinguished: species connected with
   open countryside and species connected with woody vegetation in gardens,
   hedgerows and/or habitat islands. A review of the population trends
   indicates that the declines have mainly occurred within the former
   group.}},

Abstract = {{Species of Helicoverpa represent some of the world's most studied pests.
   The amount of information available on their ecology and pest management
   is vast. This paper uses the example of the Riverina region of NSW to
   show how this information can be used in current studies. In this
   example, one of the most important questions that needs answering is,
   what is the relative contribution of migration and overwintering in the
   regional population dynamics of Helicoverpa armigera. To address this
   question emergence and pheromone traps were used to monitor the spring
   emergence and subsequent population trends. The data generated were then
   evaluated using a population development model and a migration model.
   The results are discussed in terms of possible control options for the
   management of H. armigera in the Riverina.}},

Abstract = {{To increase the national hardwood plantation estate, several species of
   eucalypts, including Eucalyptus globulus, E. grandis, E. nitens, E.
   pilularis, E. regnans, E. dunnii and Corymbia variegata, are being
   planted over a diverse range of climatic and site conditions.
   Since more than a dozen insect and fungal species were identified as
   having the potential to cause significant defoliation of one or more of
   these eucalypt species, major pest problems exist. Since the rate of
   plantation expansion is such that it is not feasible to monitor all
   susceptible plantations for all pests, an alternative approach based on
   a phytocentric, or resource-orientated model, is proposed. It focuses on
   minimising the impact of herbivory, not through the direct reduction of
   pest populations, but by maximising potential tree growth. Operational
   resources would be dedicated to establishing vigorous, rapidly growing
   plantations, thereby improving the probability that canopy production
   will outgrow most incidences of insect attack. Research effort would be
   directed towards improving intrinsic growth rates and maximising
   compensatory and recuperative growth responses of the trees. Research
   priorities would be the inclusion of natural resistance factors into
   genetic improvement programs, development of advanced nutritional and
   silvicultural techniques, and optimal site/species matching. This
   emphasis on minimising the impact of insect herbivory through the
   maintenance of a vigorous plantation requires that local conditions be
   taken into account. We therefore advocate that insect pest management of
   eucalypt plantations, rather than being a discrete strategy, be
   integrated into the broader concept of site-based management.}},

Abstract = {{The first chemical identification of an insect sex pheromone was made
   from the pheromone gland of the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori L. As
   techniques became more refined there was a rapid increase in the rate at
   which identifications were made, particularly for lepidopteran pests. In
   that order alone the pheromone blends of several hundred species have
   now been characterised.
   Entomologists were quick to recognise the potential of sex pheromones as
   a control tool in the never-ending battle against insect pests. Indeed
   there were high expectations that pheromones would play a significant
   role in IPM programs, both as a monitoring tool to more accurately time
   control measures and/or as a direct means of control through mass
   trapping and mating disruption.
   However it soon became apparent that pheromones were not achieving the
   goals envisaged by some. Interpretation of trap catches and the way in
   which they related to population densities proved to be notoriously
   difficult. Mating disruption trials often resulted in failure or
   produced inconsistent and therefore unreliable results, and mass
   trapping, at least for lepidopteran species, has had very limited
   success.
   Despite these difficulties, pheromones have been used very successfully
   in some IPM programs. The factors that influence trap catch are better
   understood, thus simplifying interpretation of catches, and the
   conditions that favour successful application of mating disruption are
   also reasonably well understood although the mechanism(s) that operate
   to bring it about are still a matter for conjecture. This paper reviews
   the role of sex pheromones in IPM programs and demonstrates that they
   have a valuable role to play in insect pest management.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of San Joaquin Valley, California citrus growers utilise a
   pest management approach that minimises insecticide applications through
   extensive monitoring of citrus thrips Scirtothrips citri (Moulton) and
   California red scale Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell). However, the
   necessity of maintaining high cosmetic quality of navel fruit for the
   fresh market causes growers to rely on broad spectrum insecticides.
   Escalating levels of organophosphate and carbamate insecticide
   resistance in citrus thrips and California red scale have led a number
   of growers to adopt an IPM program that depends primarily upon natural
   enemies. The majority of growers, however, would prefer to rely on
   registrations of new insecticides, including pyriproxifen, buprofezin,
   and imidacloprid for control of California red scale. Assays of esterase
   activity demonstrated that organophosphate resistance in California red
   scale declined several generations after a field application of an
   organophosphate insecticide. Half rates of field-aged residues of
   buprofezin, imidacloprid, and pyriproxifen showed high toxicity to the
   Coccinellid predator Rhizobius lophanthae (Blaisd.). These data coupled
   with the potential for rapid development of resistance to the new
   insecticides suggest that organophosphate insecticides should be
   maintained as part of an insecticide resistance management strategy
   within the framework of the current IPM program.}},

Abstract = {{The concepts of active fluorometry are introduced and their application
   to the measurement of variable chlorophyll-a fluorescence in
   phytoplankton is described. The technique provides information on the
   major processes involved in photochemistry including light capture and
   electron transport which in combination give an estimate of the rate of
   photosynthesis. The fluctuations in these variables in response to
   changing irradiance and nutrient conditions are illustrated using field
   and laboratory data on phytoplankton from four major taxa, and the
   results used to identify responses with time scales similar to those of
   mixing processes. Fluorometric estimates of photosynthetic rate sue
   compared with oxygen electrode measurements showing excellent agreement
   and confirming the validity of fluorometric measurements. Effective
   absorption cross-sections were surprisingly stable under the measuring
   conditions with those of cyanobacteria generally being smaller than
   other algae. The freshwater species had significantly smaller
   cross-sections than those reported for marine phytoplankton. Mechanisms
   of fluorescence quenching responded to changing light intensities at
   time scales either in the micro- to milli-second range or hours to days,
   the longer time scales having potential for tracking phytoplankton
   movement. In particular the maximum quantum yield of fluorescence
   differed between species and responded to changing light conditions with
   time scales similar to those of mixing processes. The impact of mixing
   was demonstrated by monitoring changes in the quantum yield of natural
   phytoplankton populations over a range of depths under stratified and
   mixed conditions. The results clearly demonstrate that quantum yield
   measurements can provide a useful tracer of the vertical mixing of
   phytoplankton.}},

   hybridize with the DNA probe SMP3, and resistance could not be
   transferred by mating to a sensitive strain, suggesting that
   streptomycin resistance in Israel is not plasmid-mediated. Fire blight
   symptoms were observed, for the first time, on pear blossoms during the
   autumn of 1994. A high population of 2 x 10(6)-6 x 10(7) CFU/flower in
   the autumn of 1995 and of 1996 was correlated with the appearance of
   blossom blight symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{During 1992, a multivirus epidemic reduced tomato production by as much
   as 25\% in the major tomato-growing region of Alabama. Estimated yield
   losses of 100\% resulted from the epidemic in over 250 ha in two
   counties of North Alabama. Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV), alone or
   in combination with potato potyvirus Y (PVY) and/or tobacco etch
   potyvirus (TEV), was responsible for the crop failure. CMV was detected
   alone or in combination with PVY and/or TEV in over 70\% of the samples
   tested and was present in 90\% of the fields surveyed. In 1993, 21
   tomato fields were monitored weekly from transplanting through harvest
   for CMV, PVY, TEV,tobacco mosaic tobamovirus, and tomato spotted wilt
   tospovirus. All 5 viruses were detected, with CMV occurring most
   frequently. Incidence of CMV at the 61\% level or higher was found in 16
   of the 21 fields surveyed. Tomatoes transplanted in April and May were
   least effected and had relatively low virus incidence until late in
   their development. Tomatoes transplanted in June and Jury were infected
   at an earlier age, had the highest virus incidence, were the most
   severely affected, and suffered the greatest loss in yield. In 1994,
   Aphis gossypii, the cotton aphid, was the most common virus vector found
   during an aphid monitoring/virus spread study. Populations of A.
   gossypii peaked in late June, immediately preceding a period of rapid
   CMV incidence and spread.}},

Abstract = {{Pine sawflies of the family Diprionidae use sex pheromones for mate
   location. These odors can potentially be used in forestry for detection,
   population monitoring or suppression of harmful populations. The
   European pine sawfly, Neodiprion sertifer, us es the acetate or
   :propionate of (2S, 3S, 7S)- dimethyl-pentadecan-2-ol (diprionol) as its
   pheromone, whereas the (2S, 3R, 7R)-isomer acts as an antagonist in most
   of the species' distribution range. Three small-scale attempts to use
   the antagonistic isomer for disturbance of the mate location system
   (mating disruption) are presented. The isomer was released alone or in
   combination with the pheromone isomer from dispensers 10 m apart in
   plots ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 ha in size depending on the experiments.
   The catches in pheromone traps inside and outside the treated plots were
   used for evaluation, together with the sex ratio of the following
   generation. Comparison with earlier studies showed that the antagonistic
   (2S, 3R, 7R)-isomer is less efficient for mating disruption than the
   attractive (2S, 3S, 7S)-isomer. A combination of the two isomers,
   containing 10\% of the (2S, 3R, 7R)-isomer, was not more efficient than
   using the attractive isomer alone. Finally, a project, ``Pine Sawfly
   Pheromones for Sustainable Management of European Forests,{''} supported
   by the European Commission, is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the use of pheromone traps to monitor gypsy moth
   populations in Slovakia. This insect has been the most destructive
   defoliator in Slovakia since 1986. This study involved optimization of
   pheromone (attractant, trap and dispenser), determination of the minimum
   number of sample trees and pheromone trap sets required for statistical
   evaluation, long-term assessment of population densities and gypsy moth
   males captured by pheromone traps, and specification of relationships
   between population density and numbers of gypsy moth males captured by
   pheromone traps (by means of correlation analysis). Based on the results
   obtained, it is possible to use pheromone monitoring mainly during the
   latency and ascending phases. However, in some cases, results are not
   universal. A considerable part of the results may be influenced by
   inaccuracies, e.g,, relatively low sample sizes due to physical
   feasibility limitations of the study and immigration of males. In the
   next outbreak cycle of the gypsy moth, the proposed system will be
   completed and used as a component of the integrated pest management of
   gypsy moth in Slovakia.}},

Abstract = {{The gypsy moth is a very important pest in oak forests of the Slovak
   Republic and has a 6-8 year outbreak cycle. Frequency and abundance of
   pathogens, parasitoids and unknown mortality agents were observed during
   the last two outbreak periods. Currently, we are conducting research on
   the development of a pheromone monitoring system and on the use of
   microbial pesticides such as Bacillus thuringiensis and
   nuclearpolyhedrosis virus to augment the natural bioregulation of the
   gypsy moth. Using this scientific information, an experimental model of
   gypsy moth control was developed that emphasizes the use of ecological
   methods to control gypsy moth populations in Slovakia before outbreaks
   develop. The main objective of the new strategy is to minimize the
   incidence of defoliation caused by gypsy moth. The term ``advance
   control{''}, or ``control in advance{''} is introduced to define actions
   that are taken to manage populations at a time when pest populations are
   low but have an increasing trend in abundance. The steps involved in
   this process and the parameters that were used for making decisions are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) in
   South Carolina is essential because of its recreational and economic
   value and the integral role the animal plays in wetland ecosystems.
   Although the alligator appears no longer threatened with extinction from
   overharvest, the reptile's long lifespan, small home range, and position
   at the top of the food chain combine to make it susceptible to
   potentially new man-induced threats, such as environmental toxicants.
   Little information has been accumulated as yet to determine the current
   fitness of the South Carolina alligator population and its relationship,
   if any, to environmental toxicants. A review of alligator databases
   indicates that South Carolina alligator nesting and population densities
   were at or above those levels reported elsewhere in the animal's range.
   While contaminants have been found in alligator populations, the amount
   does not appear to inhibit hatching success or sex determination.
   Monitoring and evaluation is suggested for wildlife and human concerns.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-part study (multiple mark-recapture and telemetry) was used to
   estimate the size of the shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)
   population and their habitat use in the Ogeechee River, Georgia. The
   mark-recapture study was conducted from July 1993 to December 1994 and
   used the modified Schnabel model for estimating population size.
   Sixty-two shortnose sturgeon were marked; 17 were recaptured at least
   once. Seventy-eight percent of the marked fish were older juveniles and
   adults {[}>56.0 cm fork length (FL)]. Estimated population size was 266
   (95\% CL 236-300) in 1993 and 72 (95\% CL 57-91) in 1994. CPUE declined
   6-fold from 1993 to 1994. The telemetry study was conducted from June
   1994 to June 1995. Radio and ultrasonic transmitters were used to
   monitor the movements of 20 adults and 1 juvenile shortnose sturgeon.
   Tagged fish never left the river system and used specific regions of the
   river during summer, fall/spring, and winter. During the summer, when
   water temperature was >27.0 C, fish were found frequently aggregated in
   deep holes (>4.5 m) at tidal freshwater locations {[}>44.0 river
   kilometer (rkm)]. During spring and fall, when water temperature was
   <27.0 C and >16.0 C, respectively, shortnose sturgeon moved into
   mesohaline areas (26.2-36.6 rkm); during winter when water temperatures
   dropped below 16.0 C, sturgeon moved farther downriver to polyhaline
   regions (19.2-30.5 rkm). Shortnose sturgeon were more dispersed and
   their movement increased when water temperatures were <27.0 C. This
   behavior altered the catchability of these fish and may have influenced
   our population estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Following 6 years under a 356-mm minimum length limit regulation,
   poorly-structured largemouth bass populations at 5 Texas reservoirs were
   placed under an experimental 356- to 457-mm slot length Limit in
   September 1993. The limit was designed to target angler harvest at the
   relatively abundant sub-slot fish and to increase angler catch rates
   within the protected length range. Largemouth bass populations were
   monitored at each reservoir by electrofishing at 4-8 shoreline stations
   in 1989-1992 (pre-change) and in 1995-1996 (post-change). A general
   linear model statistical procedure was used to determine any significant
   changes (P = 0.05) in the CPUE or RSD for fish below (203-355 mm),
   within (356-456 mm), or above the slot (greater than or equal to 457 mm)
   following implementation of the limit. Pre- and post-change Wr of fish
   below and within the slot as well as mean lengths of age groups at
   capture also were compared. In addition, spring creel surveys were
   conducted from 1993 to 1997 at 1 of the reservoirs. Significant changes
   in density were detected at only 2 reservoirs where CPUE203-355 and
   CPUE356-456 were significantly lower at one and CPUE356-456 was
   significantly higher at the other following implementation of the slot
   length Limit. No significant changes in RSD values were found at any
   reservoir Relative weight did not improve following the limit change.
   Results from the creel survey showed angler harvest of sub-slot fish was
   low, but did increase during the third and fourth year after the slot
   length limit was imposed when primarily 304-340-mm were harvested. Low
   fishing pressure and harvest of sub-slot bass most likely prevented the
   slot limit from producing the desired results at the creel reservoir and
   probably caused the failure at other study reservoirs as well. Other
   factors not related to the regulation could have potentially influenced
   population structure at any of the reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to evaluate the biological impacts and
   cost effectiveness of a low intensity supplemental feeding program on a
   wild rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) population. Using volunteers to
   distribute feed at predetermined amounts and frequencies, wild trout
   population densities, standing crops, and length-frequencies were
   monitored for 18 months on Looking Glass Creek near Brevard, North
   Carolina. A priori success criteria included an increase of 60 fish/km
   >254 mm and a cost to produce each trout >254 mm <\$5.00. Both densities
   and standing crops of rainbow trout >100 mm increased significantly
   following 18 months of feeding. The number of rainbow trout >254 mm
   increased by an estimated 110 fish/km after 6 months and to 315/km after
   18 months, excluding harvested fish. Each fish was estimated to cost
   \$3.44 to produce. Supplemental feeding of wild trout populations is a
   viable management option that can be used to enhance wild trout growth.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nesting effort and
   success in Florida annually before, during, and after years when eggs
   were removed from selected pairs. Complete clutches were taken to
   promote renesting. Clutches were collected after greater than or equal
   to2 weeks of natural incubation. Incubation of collected eggs was
   continued artificially and resultant young were reared in captivity in
   Oklahoma. At 11-12 weeks, young were released at established hack sites
   in Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, and North Carolina. The goal of the
   project was to increase the nesting population in the southeast without
   adversely impacting annual production in Florida. From 1985-1992, 275
   eagles were released. In 1991, the first nest resulting from the hacking
   effort was documented in Mississippi. Increases in nesting eagles in the
   other states have occurred and were perhaps, in part, a consequence of
   these releases. In Oklahoma (the only donor state where intensive
   monitoring has been conducted), 23 nests were active in 1997. Statewide
   nest effort and success in Florida bald eagles has remained stable
   during and following the period of egg removal.}},

Abstract = {{We examined aspects of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter
   quail) population dynamics in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests on
   the Vernon Ranger District, Kisatchie National Forest, located in west
   central Louisiana. We used sex, age, and weight data from 246 birds
   captured a total of 404 times during 9 February-20 June 1991-1993 in
   baited traps to describe population characteristics. We used data from
   128 (106 F:22 M) birds trapped, radio tagged, and monitored during 3
   field seasons to describe productivity and survival of these birds
   during March through August. The best-fit linear-logistic model (G2 =
   7.42, 5 df, P = 0.1912) indicated that proportions of second year (SY)
   birds captured during spring depended on year; but sex ratios of
   captured birds were independent of year. Thus. we estimated that the
   breeding population contained 42.4 +/- 3.1\% (mean +/- 1 SE) females and
   the proportion of SY birds varied among 62.5 +/- 7.1\%, 46.2 +/- 5.3\%,
   and 66.4 +/- 4.6\% during 1991, 1992, and 1993 respectively. Adult birds
   were consistently (no significant interactions with year or day, P >
   0.1) 4.1\% heavier than SY birds (168 +/- 1.2 g vs. 161 +/-: 1.1 g). We
   observed no difference in the relationship between body mass and sample
   date among years (P > 0.1), but females experienced a curvilinear change
   in mass compared to males, which decreased at a rate of 0.12 +/- 0.03
   g/day. Average clutch size for 39 completed nests pooled over years was
   13.3 +/-: 0.4. Pooled estimated nest success was 48 +/- 8\%. Of 40 nests
   found, 19 produced hatchlings for an average production rate of 5.9 +/-
   1.0 hatchlings per clutch, but 12.4 +/- 0.4 hatchlings per successful
   nest. Proportional hazards regression models indicated that hen survival
   was not affected by age (P = 0.25), but that hens were 1.8 times as
   likely to die (P = 0.05) during 1992 than during 1991 and 1993.
   Estimated 150-day (Mar-Jul) survival rates for hens were 16 +/- 4\%
   during 1992 and 36 +/- 4\% during 1991 and 1993, which were lower or
   similar to several other studies of breeding season mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Scouler's willow (Salix scouleriana) and antelope bitterbrush (Purshia
   tridentata) survival, vigor, and use by ungulates were monitored
   following shelterwood cut and prescribed burn treatments designed to
   restore pre-European settlement conditions to a western Montana forest
   stand. The prescribed burn treatments resulted in modest willow
   mortality, substantial bitterbrush mortality, concurrent decreases in
   canopy cover, but increased plant vigor in spite of heavy ungulate
   browsing on treated areas. A no stand entry option would eliminate
   mortality of individual shrubs caused by these restoration treatments,
   but population fitness may decline dramatically as overstory density
   increases, and the threat of severe wildfire will increase. A wildfire
   could he highly destructive to bitterbrush specifically, and to the

Abstract = {{The aim of the present research is to study the possibility of
   monitoring internal radiation doses to the population of the heavily
   contaminated zone at the late stage of the Chernobyl accident. Two
   methods of calculation of body content for a particular radionuclide are
   suggested. They are based on the data on amounts of specific
   radionuclides in fallout and their levels in daily urine samples of the
   inhabitants. The results obtained show that almost 25\% of internal
   radiation dose to the inhabitants of the village of Otashev is
   contributed by intakes of Sr-90. The contribution of transuranium
   elements to the total dose is estimated to be about 1.5\%. It is
   generally concluded that monitoring of the internal radiation dose of
   the inhabitants of the heavily contaminated zone at the late stage of
   the accident is not only possible, but is also of considerable
   scientific and practical interest.}},

Abstract = {{The northern part of the state of Rio de Janeiro is characterised by the
   presence of large deposits of monazite sand. In this region a monazite
   sand extraction plant is located, which has been in operation for more
   than 25 years. In order to analyse the background contribution to the
   internal contamination, 72 inhabitants of this region were monitored by
   excreta analysis. Some people have contributed with more than one sample
   to the study. In the high background radiation area it was possible to
   detect significant amounts of Th-232 in urine samples suggesting a
   chronic thorium incorporation. In `normal' background areas, as in the
   city of Rio de Janeiro, the amount of Th-232 excreted in urine is not
   significant.; The average Th-232 concentration in faeces of the
   non-exposed population is about one third of the average of Th-232
   concentration in faeces samples from the workers and twice the average
   concentration in faeces samples from inhabitants of the city of Rio de
   Janeiro. The results indicate that the thorium intake is influenced by
   the place of residence and show how important it is to characterise the
   region where workers live when occupational control is carried out.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1977, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) and
   its predecessor the Nuclear Energy Board (NEB) have implemented a
   programme to monitor the levels of radioactive contamination in the
   Irish marine environment. The concentrations of radioactivity in fish,
   shellfish, sea water, sediment and seaweed have been monitored in Irish
   coastal waters and in the western Irish Sea. The key features of the
   programme are presented with an overview of its findings. The historical
   inputs of artificial radioactivity into the Irish marine environment are
   reviewed. The primary input is the discharge of low level radioactive
   waste from the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. Other sources
   include atmospheric weapons testing, the Chernobyl accident and minor
   discharges to sewage from some Irish hospitals of radionuclides used for
   medical purposes. The aims of the Institute's monitoring programme are
   outlined and the sampling, analytical and dose assessment methodologies
   employed are summarised. The geographical distribution of artificial
   radioactivity in the marine environment is described. A decrease in the
   activity concentration with increasing distance from Sellafield is
   observed. The temporal trends in the activity concentrations of
   contaminating radionuclides are also discussed. Finally, the committed
   effective doses to members of the Irish population due to anthropogenic
   radioactivity in the marine environment are presented. Doses have
   declined over the monitoring period, corresponding to the reduction in
   the level of marine discharges from Sellafield. These doses represent
   less than 1\% of the annual dose limit for members of the public, as
   recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection
   (ICRP).}},

Abstract = {{The `critical group' concept provides a robust means of demonstrating
   compliance with radiological dose limits set for routine effluent
   discharges arising from operational nuclear plants. Calculating the
   average dose to members of the critical group based on reasonable
   `maximising assumptions' offers a defensible degree of conservatism in
   demonstrating compliance with the dose limits and, in principle, the
   identification of a `relatively homogeneous' group, representative of
   those individuals in the population expected to receive the highest
   radiation dose, appears to offer no difficulties. Over the past twenty
   years, since publication of ICRP 26 guidance, however, there have been a
   number of changes to dose limits and interpretation of critical groups.
   In practice this has resulted in seeking more realistic dose estimates.
   Where a number of different habits are relevant to exposure (e.g.
   consumption of marine foods, fishing, occupancy of intertidal areas and
   components from terrestrial pathways) the requirements for homogeneity
   and realism may conflict. Radiological assessments based on critical
   groups, and associated environmental monitoring programmes, need to be
   sensitive to changes in individual pathways without necessarily
   switching the focus of presentation in a way which may appear haphazard
   to members of the public. A balanced approach is thus required in
   defining group characteristics, and presentation of ranges on estimated
   dose may be appropriate. These issues are considered in the context of
   assessment of doses to marine critical groups in West Cumbria.}},

Abstract = {{Little information has been presented average radon conclusions in the
   living specs in Korea to date although radon has become a greate concern
   in recent years to the Korean population due to association with the
   lung cancer risk. Since radon related health risks depends on long-term
   exposure, it is vital to know the relationship between these short-term
   measurements and long-term radon concentrations in the different living
   spaces. Previous studies have shown that many factors may contribute to
   the temporal and geographic variation in radon entry and retention in
   living spaces. These factors may differ from one region of the country
   to another and over time Thus. it is important that comparisons of
   different measurement protocols include samples drawn from a broad range
   of radon sources, different types of environments, and lifestyles. The
   present work compares the results of short-term and long-term surveys of
   radon measurements conducted in various areas in Korea that contains
   average radon-strength sources,different types of living spaces, and
   different seasons. Most of average airborne radon concentrations using
   track etch radon detectors were measured in different environments such
   as houses, subway stations, underground stores, indoor and outdoor
   office buildings. In addtion to these studies, a series of radon surveys
   using passive integrating radon cup monitors were undertaken indifferent
   types of dwellings in Seoul for one year since April 1996, while the
   same survey using radon discriminative dosimeters Here conducted in
   major six cities in Korea. Radon concentrations in basements in the
   selected dwellings were higher than those levels measured in the first
   floor, while indoor radon concentrations were significantly higher than
   the corresponding outdoor levels at six survey sites. The results
   suggest the need to more definitely assess sources of radon
   concentrations as well as to provide more Information about technical
   measurements of different radon monitors.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine whether faecal progestagen
   measurement could be used to diagnose pregnancy in wild black rhinoceros
   cows. Immunoreactive 20 alpha-progestagens were measured in faecal
   samples collected regularly (one or two times times per week) from
   pregnant and non-pregnant wild black rhinoceros females (n = 6) in
   Zimbabwe. Fresh dung piles deposited by the study animals were serially
   sampled during prolonged periods of tracking with local game scouts.
   Samples were stored frozen, and dried prior to methanol extraction.
   Immunoreactivity in faecal extracts was measured with a 20
   alpha-dihydroprogesterone enzyme immunoassay and was shown to reflect
   circulating progesterone concentrations. Mean concentrations of faecal
   20 alpha-progestagens during each month of gestation were significantly
   higher than faecal concentrations in non-pregnant animals (P<0.05),
   except during the second month of gestation. Faecal 20
   alpha-progestagens remained 5-10 times higher than concentrations in
   non-pregnant animals from the 4th to 15th month of gestation. It was
   concluded that regular non-invasive reproductive monitoring of black
   rhinoceros in the wild was possible and that pregnancy could be
   accurately diagnosed from the measurement of 20 alpha-progestagens in
   faecal samples. The use of this technique in wild black rhinoceros
   populations will offer new perspectives for in situ management of this
   endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term dynamics of relative abundance of generations, with
   parallel weather monitoring throughout the year, was traced. The yearly
   success of metamorphosis is independent of the amount of spawn produced
   and is only conditioned by the water balance of reproductive ponds. The
   abundance of young of the year in autumn weakly depends on reproductive
   success, being associated mainly with the duration of fattening and the
   weather during this period. The abundance of yearlings, vaguely
   depending on their number in the year of metamorphosis, is determined by
   both duration and conditions of fattening before the first hibernation
   and by wintering conditions. The group of mature individuals in autumn
   is represented mainly by 2- and 3-year-old individuals, whose proportion
   is nonvariable and indeterminate. The size of this group depends on the
   conditions (temperature of the environment) in which the animals spent
   their first winter.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term trends in the abundance and species composition of zooplankton
   are described. These trends are based on retrospective analysis of
   zooplankton samples collected in the St Helena Bay area off the South
   African west coast since the development of the pelagic fishery in the
   1950s. Samples were selected from seven sampling programmes (1951-1967,
   1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1988-1996) that monitored the main
   commercial fishing grounds during peak recruitment (March-June).
   Abundance data are presented for size-based taxonomic groups, which
   include cyclopoid and small, medium and large calanoid copepods,
   cladocerans, euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths and pelagic tunicates.
   Despite discontinuity in the time-series and the use of different
   samplers, all taxa showed a significant long-term increase in their
   abundance by at least one order of magnitude between 1951 and 1996.
   Total zooplankton abundance increased from 4.2x10(3) to 7.2x10(5)
   ind.m(-2) over the same period. Multiple regression analysis of the
   log-transformed data indicates size-based differential rates of increase
   in population levels among the crustacean size classes, with a maximum
   rate in cyclopoids (slope = 0.052) and a minimum rate in euphausiids
   (slope = 0.035). This resulted in a significant shift through time in
   the crustacean zooplankton community structure, which may reflect
   differential size-selective predation during periods of anchovy
   Engraulis capensis or sardine Sardinops sagax dominance. The observed
   long-term increase in zooplankton abundance could be a response to a
   long-term decrease in predation pressure following decreases in stocks
   of pelagic fish, which in turn could be caused by increased predation by
   top predators. Another mechanism contributing to the long-term increase
   in zooplankton is the observed long-term intensification of coastal
   upwelling, which could enhance primary and secondary production, and
   increase advective input of zooplankton populations into the study area
   and augment their retention.}},

Abstract = {{Soil conservation and watershed development activities are hard to
   evaluate since neither their effects nor their beneficiaries can be
   easily detected. In monitoring and evaluating the effects of these
   activities, indicators play a crucial role.
   The Konto River Project in East Java, Indonesia, paid much attention to
   monitoring. Hydrological and erosion research was undertaken to assess
   effects of land use changes on erosion and streamflow. Physical
   monitoring focused on tree survival rates, the state of terraces, etc,
   and a socio-economic monitoring programme looked at farmers'
   participation, costs and benefits. For this monitoring, various physical
   and socio-economic indicators were used, part of which were reviewed
   during a brief post-evaluation mission.
   It proved hard to find effective indicators, which should be
   unambiguously defined, consistent, specific, sensitive to small changes
   and easy in data collection (Casley and Kumar, 1987). The land use
   changes covered about 2,000 ha, or almost 10\% of the area, but effects
   on erosion and hydrological parameters were small. Suitable and easy
   (proxy) indicators were tree survival rates, combined with tree height
   and diameter for remaining trees, for reforestation results, and
   participation rates for the involvement of the population. Despite the
   use of many proxy indicators for changes in productivity and
   socio-economic status, the results of the socio-economic monitoring
   activities were much affected by autonomous developments. A plea is made
   to improve monitoring systems.}},

Abstract = {{During 1987-94 we used capture-mark-resight (CMR) methodology and rates
   of observation (bears/hour and bears/100 km(2)) of unmarked brown bears
   (Ursus arctos middendorffi) during intensive aerial surveys (IAS) to
   estimate abundance of brown bears on Kodiak Island and to establish a
   baseline for monitoring population trends. CMR estimates were obtained
   on 3 study areas; density ranged from 216-234 bears/1,000 km(2) for
   independent animals and 292-342 bears/1,000 km(2) including dependent
   offspring. Rates of observation during IAS ranged from 1.4-5.4
   independent bears/hour and 2.9-18.0 independent bears/100 km(2). Density
   estimates for independent bears on each IAS area were obtained by
   dividing mean number of bears observed during replicate surveys by
   estimated sightability (based on CMR-derived sightability in areas with
   similar habitat). Brown bear abundance on 21 geographic units of Kodiak
   Island and 3 nearby islands was estimated by extrapolation from CMR and
   IAS data, using comparisons of habitat characteristics and sport harvest
   information. Population estimates for independent and total bears were
   1,800 and 2,600. The CMR and IAS procedures offer alternative means,
   depending on management objective and available resources, of measuring
   population trend of brown bears on Kodiak Island.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction and survival of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) were studied
   in the area southwest of Kugluktuk, Northwest Territories, between 1988
   and 1995. Thirteen radiocollared female grizzly bears were monitored for
   up to 7 years in tundra habitat southwest of Kugluktuk. Adult female
   survival was high (98\%); the only 2 adult female mortalities were from
   intraspecific predation. Mean litter size was 2.3 cubs <1 year old (n =
   19), mean birth interval was 2.6 years (n = 8), and the annual natality
   rate was 0.87 cubs/adult female. Mean reproductive interval between
   successful litters was 3.3 years (n = 6). First-year cub survival was
   81\%, and second-year cub survival was 76-84\%. Age at first parturition
   averaged 8.7 years (n = 6), which is later than in other northern
   grizzly bear populations. However, growth curves indicated that maturity
   was not delayed by nutrition. The estimated finite rate of population
   increase (lambda) was 1.026. These results indicate that the Kugluktuk
   grizzly bear population can sustain a small harvest provided that
   females are protected.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, many bear populations face increasing threats from habitat
   loss and fragmentation, demographic limitations, and loss of genetic
   diversity. Managing these small populations presents special challenges
   requiring organized, quick, efficient responses from limited personnel
   and resources if a small population is to persist. Local wildlife
   managers can use strategic planning to help to focus their conservation
   efforts by defining conditions necessary to sustain a threatened
   population in terms of habitat needs, public support for conservation,
   and mortality limitation. Managers can develop a program that will
   address how to obtain the conditions specified in the strategic plan. To
   define conditions that will allow a population to persist, strategic
   planners must describe the desired future condition for the major
   factors affecting the population. To achieve this desired future
   condition, a strategic targeting approach should be used. Strategic
   targeting is an ordered approach to: (1) identify problems limiting bear
   populations and rank their importance; (2) identify who has the most
   influence and control over these problems; (3) assign responsibilities
   to address these problems; (4) develop an approach to minimize the
   threat and eliminate the problem; and (5) schedule the actions necessary
   and monitor the success of the actions. Management efforts to conserve
   small bear populations are often costly and may require significant
   changes in human use of bear habitat. Such changes are not casually
   accepted by the general public, or by people interested in resource
   development. Credible data and monitoring are necessary both to monitor
   management activities and to maintain them over the period necessary to
   achieve results. Implementing conservation efforts usually cannot wait
   until monitoring data are available. However, monitoring can improve and
   refine conservation efforts as data are gathered. Successful monitoring
   requires annual application of methods to be used by management agencies
   with minimal disturbance to the population. Data from monitoring can
   help convince the public of the need to conserve the population and to
   direct and improve conservation actions so they continue to address the
   problems facing the population. I outline a strategic targeting approach
   for conservation of small populations emphasizing biological and habitat
   parameters that can be monitored and describe how to organize a
   conservation program to establish such monitoring.}},

   and competed with males who centered most of their activities in the
   study area. Observations of breeding activity did not reliably indicate

   not possible. Since females tend to be strongly philopatric, male
   behavior (influenced to some degree by female choice) is thus the
   primary mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity in brown or grizzly

Abstract = {{Scientists and managers want to use the best available information to
   make decisions that affect natural resources. However, we believe the
   case history of research and management of the grizzly bear (Ursus
   arctos) in the Fishing Bridge area of Yellowstone National Park typifies
   the frequent failure of effective information transfer between
   scientists, managers, and the public. For 25 years, plans to reduce
   human influences on grizzly bears and their habitat have been revised or
   postponed, causing grizzly bear advocates to criticize managers' intent
   and commitment. The time lag between scientific data collection,
   analysis, and information transfer to decisionmakers as well as changes
   in both the biological and socio-political environment hindered progress
   toward what was clearly intended as a benefit to the ecosystem's
   population of grizzly bears. This case study reaffirms the need for
   constant monitoring and evaluation of progress toward stated objectives
   and points to the need for increased flexibility in federal agencies'
   application of decision-making strategies. We suggest that agencies
   become familiar with techniques such as adaptive management as a method
   to adjust to constantly changing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In 1991-92, we simultaneously observed grizzly bears (Ursus arctos
   horribilis) from the ground and air at moth aggregation sites east of
   Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, to determine the ability of aerial
   observers to sight and classify bears. The Interagency Grizzly Bear
   Study Team (IGBST) uses aerial surveys to count and monitor the
   reproductive success of unduplicated females with cubs (0.5-year olds)
   in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). Much of their effort is
   focused in alpine talus areas because females with cubs congregate there
   to forage on army cutworm moths (Euxoa auxiliaris). Aerial observers
   sighted 92\% (49/53) of all bears, 85\% (22/26) of independent bears,
   and all (n = 10) family groups present during 6 surveys, but they
   misclassified 3 of 5 subadults as lone adults, 1 of 7 lone adults as a
   subadult, and a female with 3 yearlings as 4 lone adults. Further,
   aerial observers sighted 89\% of all bears (n = 55) and 79\% of
   independent bears (n = 28) that used moth sites on the days that surveys
   were conducted. Classification of family groups and lone bears did not
   significantly differ between ground and aerial counts, but further
   stratification of lone bears indicated significant (P = 0.03)
   under-representation of subadults and over-representation of lone adults
   from the air. Low sightability of subadults (56\%) and misclassification
   of family groups also contributed to these errors. Aerial observers
   sighted and accurately classified all 5 adult females with cubs present
   during the aerial surveys, and no yearlings were misclassified as cubs.
   However, using other data collected from the ground, we found that
   aerial observers sighted only 82\% of all females with cubs because 2 of
   11 family groups observed to use study sites were not present during
   aerial surveys. Nevertheless, aerial sightability and classification of
   females with cubs and estimates of litter size at moth sites seemed
   reliable.}},

Abstract = {{The average age of first reproduction appears to be a useful index of
   habitat quality for bear populations. However, the conventional method
   for calculating this age, using only bears whose first litters were
   observed, gives a low-biased estimate. This bias is a consequence of
   losing bears approaching their cub-producing years due to death, lost
   radio contact, or removal of radiocollar. Late-maturing bears are more
   likely than early-maturing bears to be lost before they produce a
   litter; thus, if they are not included in the sample, the estimate
   becomes biased low. We propose a method that generates virtually
   unbiased estimates of the mean and median ages of primiparity using data
   from bears that did not produce cubs as well as from those that did.
   First, we calculate the proportion of females that produced a first
   litter among all nulliparous females monitored at each age; these
   proportions are weighted by the proportion of females in the population
   that are available to have a first litter at each age. This procedure is
   analogous to the estimation of survivorship based on radio-days of
   monitoring. We tested our method using data from radiocollared black
   bears (Ursus americanus) in Minnesota and Massachusetts and found that
   the conventional method underestimated both the mean and median ages of
   first reproduction by 0.2-0.5 years. Our approach produced an estimate
   of the expected age of first reproduction free of the effects of
   study-related shortcomings and independent of mortality. This estimate
   is more appropriate for cross-population comparisons, as well as for
   population modeling.}},

Abstract = {{The reliability of wastewater reclamation and reuse to meet a given
   annual risk of infection, considering the variability of enteric virus
   concentrations, has been investigated. Two concepts related to the
   reliability and safety of wastewater reclamation and reuse are
   presented. The first is reliability, defined as the probability that the
   risk of infection from enteric viruses in reclaimed wastewater does not
   exceed an acceptable risk. The second is based on the expectation of the
   acceptable annual risk in which the exposure to enteric viruses may be
   estimated stochastically by numerical simulation.
   To assess the potential risks associated with the use of reclaimed
   wastewater in various reuse applications, four exposure scenarios were
   tested: golf course irrigation, food crop irrigation, recreational
   impoundments, and groundwater recharge. Past monitoring data on enteric
   virus concentrations in unchlorinated secondary effluents in California
   were used. Because enteric virus concentrations in unchlorinated
   secondary effluents were found to vary over a wide range, characterizing
   their variability was found to be extremely important. The reliability
   criterion of meeting the less than 10(-4) annual risk of infection (less
   than or equal to one infection per 10 000 population per year) at least
   95\% of the time was used to assess the safety of using reclaimed
   wastewater in the four different exposure scenarios. The methodologies
   used in this study should be refined, based on a larger enteric virus
   database developed using standardized field and laboratory protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation tillage has become an attractive form of agricultural
   management practices for corn and soybean production on heavy textured
   soil in southern Ontario because of the potential for improving soil
   quality. A controlled drainage system combined with conservation tillage
   practices has also been reported to improve water quality. In
   Southwestern Ontario, field scale an farm demonstration sites were
   established in a paired watershed (no-tillage vs. conventional tillage)
   on clay loam soil to study the effect of tillage system on soil
   structure and water quality. The sites included controlled drainage and
   free drainage systems to monitor their effect on nitrate loss in the
   tile drainage water.
   Soil structure, organic matter content and water storage in the soil
   profile were improved with no-tillage (NT) compared to conventional
   tillage (CT). No-tillage also increased earthworm populations.
   No-tillage was found to have higher tile drainage volume and nitrate
   loss which were attributed to an increase in soil macropores from
   earthworm activity. The controlled drainage system (CD) reduced nitrate
   loss in tile drainage water by 14\% on CT site and 25.5\% on NT site
   compared to the corresponding free drainage system (DR) from May, 1995
   to April 30, 1997. No-tillage farming practices are definitely enhanced
   by using a controlled drainage system for preventing excessive nitrate
   leaching through tile drainage. Average soybean yields for CT site were
   about 12 to 14\% greater than the NT site in 1995 and 1996. However,
   drainage systems had very little effect on soybean yields in 1995 and
   1996 due to extremely dry growing seasons. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{The results of a study on the riverine nutrient emissions and loads of
   nine river basins of the country Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the Baltic
   Sea are presented for the period 1992 to 1994. The basins represent
   about 76\% of the Baltic Sea catchment area of Mecklenburg-Vorpommem.
   The population living in the basins causes point emissions of 1752 tN/a
   and 293 tP/a. The analysis of diffuse emissions of nutrients is based on
   digitized maps of the land use and the soil types, the livestock numbers
   in the basins and measurements on the nutrient concentrations in the
   groundwater and drainage areas. The used method considers different
   pathways of diffuse sources as load from urban areas, erosion, load by
   groundwater, and drainage systems, atmospheric deposition, and direct
   load by agricultural activities. The dominant pathway of nitrogen
   emissions is the emissions of drainage. For phosphorus the emissions by
   erosion, groundwater and drainage are the main sources. The emissions of
   point sources contribute to the total emissions to 10\% (N) and 25\%
   (P), respectively. The measured nutrient load at the monitoring stations
   of the rivers is in all cases lower than the sum of the nutrient
   emissions. This behaviour can be explained by intensive retention
   processes in the rivers, which depends an the specific runoff, and for
   nitrogen additionally on the area of surface water in the basin.
   Measures against the high nutrient load have to be focussed on the
   reduction of diffuse sources, especially the emissions of nitrogen and
   phosphorus by drainage systems have to be reduced, and additionally in
   the case of phosphorus the emissions by erosion and by direct
   agricultural load. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   demonstrate the feasability of combining nitrifying microflora and the

   mathematical model based on batch cultures was developed to help us
   control the M. aerodenitrificans cultivation and maintain it in a
   complex ecosystem. The specific detection and monitoring of the pure

Abstract = {{Increasing demand for limited water resources within the Midlands of
   England resulted in a lower quality river being considered for water
   supply in an area of high urban and rural population. A comprehensive
   water quality monitoring programme was undertaken on the river to
   compare its quality with other sources used for water supply. Concurrent
   with the monitoring programme a series of laboratory scale trials began
   to assess how the river water could be treated, and the costs involved A
   major consideration was the need to provide treated water by the summer
   of 1997, which precluded a complete new water treatment process from
   being designed.
   The paper outlines the results from the monitoring programme, including
   some of the problem parameters such as pesticides at over 10 ug/l, and
   how some of the sources of these pollutants were identified. It also
   describes the treatment trials and explains how a water treatment
   process was developed which utilises disused gravel workings to provide
   bankside storage and a combination of powdered and granular activated
   carbon to remove organic pollutants. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{An evaluation of potential population exposure to benzene in drinking
   water and in indoor air was conducted in an attempt to consider the
   adequacy of the allowable level set for benzene in Canadian drinking
   water (5 mu g/l). Exposure factors representative of the Canadian adult
   population; including tapwater and beverage-based tapwater consumption,
   body weights, time spent inside residences, and levels of benzene in
   residential air; were assessed using the method of Monte Carlo
   probability modeling. Rates of benzene exposure from consumption of
   drinking water were estimated to be lower than from inhalation of indoor
   air by up to a factor of ten for almost half of the adult population
   when the drinking water concentration was represented by the allowable
   level. With respect to human exposure, 5 mu g/l of benzene in drinking
   water would not contribute significantly to exposure that is already
   estimated to occur from breathing air inside their homes for almost half
   of the adult population. On that basis the drinking water level would
   appear more than adequate for public health protection. However,
   Canadian agencies may need to pay greater attention to exposure to
   benzene in residential air, as no similar criteria or monitoring
   programs exist to protect the public. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes for phylogenetically defined
   groups of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were used for analyzing
   the natural diversity of nitrifiers in an industrial sewage treatment
   plant receiving sewage with high ammonia concentrations. In this
   facility discontinuous aeration is used to allow for complete
   nitrification and denitrification. In situ hybridization revealed a yet
   undescribed diversity of ammonia oxidizers occurring in the plant.
   Surprisingly, the majority of the ammonia oxidizers were detected with
   probe combinations which indicate a close affiliation of these cells
   with Nitrosococcus mobilis. In addition, low numbers of
   ammonia-oxidizers related to the Nitrosomonas europaea Nitrosomonas
   eutropha cluster were present. Interestingly, we also observed
   hybridization patterns which suggested the occurrence of a novel
   population of ammonia oxidizers. Confocal laser scanning microscopy
   revealed that all specifically stained ammonia oxidizers were clustered
   in microcolonies formed by rod-shaped bacteria. Combination of FISH and
   mathematical modeling was used to investigate diffusion limitation of
   ammonia and O-2 within these aggregates. Model simulations suggest that
   mass transfer limitations inside the clusters are not as significant as
   the substrate limitations due to the activity of surrounding
   heterotrophic bacteria. To learn more about the ammonia-oxidizers of the
   industrial plant, we enriched and isolated ammonia-oxidizing bacteria
   from the activated sludge by combining classical cultivation techniques
   and FISH. Monitoring the isolates with the nested probe set allowed us
   to specifically identify those ammonia oxidizers which were found in
   situ to be numerically dominant. The phylogenetic relationship of these
   isolates determined by comparative 16S rDNA sequence analysis confirmed
   the affiliation suggested by FISK. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Understanding patterns of weed seedling emergence within a growing
   season and over years is important to develop models to predict optimum
   timing of weed management practices. A study was conducted in a field
   with no previous velvetleaf infestations to describe emergence patterns
   following seed burial at three depths in two tillage systems. Freshly
   harvested velvetleaf seeds were planted 0, 2, and 6 cm deep in moldboard
   plowed (MP) and no-tillage (NT) corn stubble in October 1990. Velvetleaf
   seedling emergence was monitored over the following 4 yr in continuous
   corn. Emergence was higher in NT than in MP plots throughout 4 yr of
   observation. The first growing season following seeding, emerged
   seedlings represented 9.3 to 15.8\% of the seeds sown in NT, compared
   with 0.1 to 0.8\% of seeds sown in ME After four growing seasons,
   emerged seedlings were 12.5 to 25\% of seeds sown in NT but only 6 to
   7.4\% of seeds sown in MP. Emergence was consistently higher from the
   0-cm depth than from the 6-cm depth in NT, but seeding depth did not
   influence emergence in MP due to mixing of the soil during tillage.
   Velvetleaf emergence was related to growing degree days (base 7.5 C),
   with greater consistency in NT than in MP. Averaged over years and
   planting depths, 50\% velvetleaf emergence occurred within 8 and 13 d of
   the predicted date in NT and MP systems, respectively.}},

Title = {{Active wolverine Gulo gulo dens as a minimum population estimator in
   Scandinavia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{159-168}},
Abstract = {{Minimum numbers of wolverines Gulo gulo were estimated for Scandinavia,
   based on the average number of active dens recorded in 1995-1997. To
   estimate the proportion of females active at dens, we followed
   individual females using radio-telemetry in northern Sweden, northern
   Norway and south-central Norway. The sex and age structure of the
   population was estimated based on a sample of wolverines harvested
   before the introduction of protective measures and harvest restrictions.
   Our results are compared with those found in other published wolverine
   studies, mostly from North America. The Scandinavian population of
   one-year-old and older wolverines was estimated at 413 +/- 71 (SD)
   individuals (265 +/- 55 in Sweden and 147 +/- 25 in Norway). This method
   gave a lower population estimate than those found in earlier surveys
   based on summation of local (municipality) estimates (Troms) and on
   local tracking surveys (Nordland). The differences may be explained by
   the existence of a large number of undiscovered natal dens in the two
   counties mentioned above, but the previous estimates were based on
   methodologies with sources of error that could inflate estimates. The
   population size in south-central Norway (the Snohetta plateau,
   Trollheimen, Reinheimen and Rondane), based on the average number of
   active natal dens during 1995-1997, was estimated to be 26 +/- 7
   individuals. This was in concordance with the 23-30 individuals
   estimated from intensive tracking and radio-telemetry in spring 1995.
   Monitoring wolverine reproduction as a basis for population estimates
   could provide an important management tool. Based on our results, we
   recommend that the management authorities in Norway closely monitor the
   presently high harvest rate of wolverines in parts of the country, and
   establish population monitoring methods that allow continuous evaluation
   of management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic changes in three free-ranging rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)
   populations were monitored over 4 years in southern Western Australia.
   Peak densities followed periods of high rainfall and pasture biomass.
   The breeding season was prolonged, often extending from at least April
   to November, with some pregnancies occurring outside this period.
   Fecundity, determined by the autopsy of pregnant offsite rabbits and the
   known length of each breeding season, appeared to be relatively high,
   with the potential for 34-39 kittens doe(-1) year(-1); however, because
   not all females are pregnant in all months, the overall productivity of
   these populations was estimated at 25-30 kittens adult female(-1)
   year(-1). Exponential rates of increase varied from 0.13 to 0.30 during
   the breeding periods and -0.05 to -0.14 during the nonbreeding season.
   Kitten survival was generally low whereas some adults lived for more
   than 5 years. Two patterns of myxomatosis were observed: annual
   epizootics of the disease (3 of 4 years) and an epidemic that slowly
   spread over many months. European rabbit fleas were most abundant during
   winter-spring and attained highest densities on adult female rabbits.}},

Abstract = {{The epidemiology of myxomatosis was investigated in 12 populations of
   wild European rabbits at Wellstead in southern Western Australia, which
   were part of a larger study of the effects of imposing different levels
   of female sterility on rabbit population dynamics. Using serology, the
   aims were firstly to monitor the epidemic pattern of myxomatosis on the
   study sites between 1993 and 1996, and then to determine whether imposed
   sterility had any influence on the prevalence of myxomatosis. Two
   patterns of epidemics were observed during the study. The predominant
   pattern was a spring-summer outbreak that left approximately 90\% of
   rabbits seropositive for myxoma virus antibodies. The second pattern was
   a slowly spreading epidemic that lasted from autumn until the following
   spring. This second type of epidemic may be important in the persistence
   of myxoma virus. Imposed levels of female sterility as high as 80\% for
   three years had no significant effect on the proportion of animals
   seropositive for myxoma virus antibodies.}},

Abstract = {{The value of road-kill counts in monitoring changes in numbers of the
   eastern barred bandicoot, Perameles gunnii, was investigated in the Huon
   Valley, south-eastern Tasmania, by comparing population trends on two
   trapping grids with trends in road-kills on adjacent segments of
   highway. Between 1992 and 1996, both the number of P. gunnii on the
   trapping grids and the number of road-kills on the adjacent highway
   underwent a significant decline. While our data are preliminary, we
   suggest that road-kills may provide a useful index of gross, long-term
   trends in numbers of P. gunni. Such an index could be used to track
   longterm trends in local populations adjacent to a segment of highway,
   as in the present study. Alternatively, by considering a highway as a
   continuous `chain' of such segments, road-kills may provide an index of
   trends over a larger (i.e. regional) scale.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{393-407}},
Abstract = {{Feral goats (Capra hircus) were shot from a helicopter on four sites in
   central-western Queensland. These sites centred on Idalia National Park
   (660 km(2)) and three nearby properties: Lissoy (360 km(2)), Mt Calder
   (260 km(2)) and Ravensbourne (320 km(2)), the order reflecting
   increasing goat density. On Idalia, 134 goats were shot in 8 h of flying
   time. On Lissoy, 28 goats were shot in 3 h, 1038 goats were shot on Mt
   Calder in 15 h, while 2307 goats were shot on Ravensbourne in 21 h. The
   reduction was monitored by aerial surveys using fixed-wing aircraft. No
   goats were recorded on either Idalia or Lissoy immediately following
   shooting and substantial reductions in goat numbers were achieved on Mt
   Calder (75\%) and Ravensbourne (49\%). Surveys conducted six months
   after this reduction indicated population increases on all sites
   following shooting. This was particularly marked on Ravensbourne, where
   goat numbers had increased by 31\% despite further substantial removals
   by commercial mustering. These population increases were largely the
   result of immigration. The cooperation of landowners over a large area
   is therefore essential for effective control of goats. The per capita
   cost of shooting goats from a helicopter was essentially constant down
   to a threshold density of <1 goat km(-2), below which the cost increased
   substantially.
   The accuracy of fixed-wing aerial surveys was improved by using
   double-counting and these corrected estimates compared favourably with
   index-manipulation-index estimates. Estimates of densities ii goat
   km(-2) were imprecise and at these densities goats were difficult to
   detect. The extent of vegetation cover did not affect the sightability
   of goats, whereas group size was positively correlated with the
   sightability of goats. To estimate true density, correction factors of
   1-2 were applied to goat group sizes using survey parameters of 100 m
   strip width, a survey height of 76 m and a speed of 187 km h(-1).}},

Pages = {{437-447}},
Abstract = {{An important step towards evaluating ecological sustainability of
   resource use is to understand the characteristics of that resource.
   Indonesian populations of the Asian water monitor (Varanus salvator)
   have been heavily exploited over several decades for the reptile skin
   industry. We visited two cities in northern Sumatra (Rantauprapat and
   Cikampak) to gather information on the sizes, sexes, reproductive status
   and food habits of harvested specimens. Data on 399 lizards showed that
   monitors in northern Sumatra are similar in most respects to those
   studied previously in southern Sumatra (Palembang), despite the
   considerable distance between the two areas and the significant
   difference in climates. Male water monitors mature at a smaller size
   than females, but grow to larger body sizes. Harvesting is concentrated
   on adult males, and adult plus juvenile females. Reproduction occurs
   year-round, but at a lower intensity in drier months (March and June).
   Females produce multiple clutches of 6-17 eggs each year. These lizards
   eat a wide variety of prey, including commensal vertebrates (e.g. rats,
   chickens) as well as invertebrates (e.g. insects, crabs). The numbers of
   stomach parasites (spirurid nematodes, Tanqua tiara) were higher in
   juvenile lizards than in adults, and varied between our two sampling
   sites. Our results suggest that water monitors exhibit relatively little
   morphological or ecological divergence over broad areas within Sumatra,
   hence simplifying the task of developing appropriate management systems
   for the commercial harvest.}},

Abstract = {{The grain-growing areas of South Australia were affected by a severe
   mouse plague during the winter and spring of 1993. Damage to recently
   sown and maturing crops was minimised by broadcasting 0.3\%
   strychnine-treated wheat across affected crops, at a rate of 1 kg
   ha(-1). Three indices were used to measure relative mouse abundance
   before and after treatment: counts of active mouse holes, bait card
   consumption, and live-trapping. Hole counts and live-trapping both
   underestimated treatment effects. Bait card consumption provided the
   most accurate indication of treatment effects. In crops treated across
   their entire area, treatment reduced bait card consumption by 87\%, with
   greater than or equal to 95\% reduction in 18 of 28 crops monitored. In
   most cases, baiting stopped damage by mice and allowed farmers to
   establish healthy crops where previously mice had removed all the seed
   sown, and resown, prior to treatment. Perimeter baiting was less
   successful owing to rapid reinvasion of treated areas, and reduced
   average bait card consumption by only 16\%. Strychnine baiting in crop
   stubbles was ineffective where weed seeds were abundant.}},

Title = {{Behavioral correlates of physiological estrus in cheetahs}},
Journal = {{ZOO BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{193-209}},
Abstract = {{Historically, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) has been known for its poor
   reproductive performance in captivity. Although breeding success has
   improved over the past decade, the percentage of breeders in the captive
   population is still low and successful propagation unpredictable. Estrus
   in this species has been reported as ``silent{''} by some, therefore
   contributing to breeding problems by making appropriate timing of pair
   introductions difficult. To investigate whether any observable
   behavioral changes may be associated with estrus, we carried out
   quantitative behavioral observations and concomitant noninvasive
   monitoring of estradiol metabolites excreted in feces of 14 captive
   female cheetahs for periods of 5-22 consecutive weeks. We found that
   changes in fecal estradiol concentrations correlated significantly with
   variation in the occurrence of several types of behaviors, including
   rolling, rubbing, sniffing, vocalizing, and urine spraying. However, the
   number and types of correlated behaviors varied across females,
   revealing no single behavior indicative of estrus, but rather a
   constellation of behaviors that increased in frequency when estradiol
   concentrations were elevated. There was no significant difference in the
   overall average estradiol concentrations or peak values of the females
   that had previously mated and conceived compared to those of the females
   that had failed to breed. Successful breeders appeared to show
   significantly higher rates of rubbing and rolling than nonbreeders.
   However, rates of rubbing, rolling, and urine spraying also were found
   to increase with age, and older individuals were more likely to have
   bred. The results of this study indicate that estrus in the cheetah
   cannot be regarded as ``silent{''} since the frequencies of some
   behaviors appear to covary with fluctuating estradiol levels. However,
   behavioral monitoring of estrus may nevertheless be difficult and
   time-consuming due to individual variation and subtle changes in
   behavioral frequencies rather than changes in the types of behaviors
   displayed. Zoo Biol 17:193-209, 1998. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of sewage sludge application on
   biological and biochemical properties of soil in the plots maintained by
   the City of Winnipeg at Oak Hammock Marsh, Manitoba. Soils were
   collected from plots receiving single and multiple applications of 0, 50
   and 100 tonnes of sludge ha(-1). Sludge application significantly (P <
   0.05) increased the amount of microbial biomass present in the soils.
   The biomass N content was uncharacteristically low resulting in a mean
   microbial biomass C:N ratio of 36:1. Despite the low C:N ratio of the
   biomass, sludge application enhanced the N mineralization potential of
   the soil. Potential activities of three soil enzymes (arylsulfatase,
   acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase) were also monitored in this
   study. Sludge application somewhat increased soil enzyme activities. In
   addition, a significant (P < 0.05) temporal variation in potential
   activities was also observed in this study. The functional diversity of
   the soil community was assessed using Biolog(TM) microplates. The
   highest rate of sludge application (2 x 100 t ha(-1)) was found to
   significantly (P < 0.04) reduce the functional diversity of the soil
   community. These results suggest that although the sludge application
   resulted in a reduction in the diversity of the microbial population,
   the overall size of the soil microbial biomass and its nutrient
   mineralization potential were either unchanged or increased. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{An aerial photographic census of flamingos (Phoenicopterus minor and P.
   ruber) was conducted on 20 July 1994 on nine lakes in Tanzania: Lakes
   Natron, Manyara, Magadi (Ngorongoro), Burungi, Embagai, Eyasi, Lagarja,
   Masek, and Ambussel. This census. conducted concurrently with a survey
   in Kenya, documented the numbers and distribution of flamingos in the
   Rift Valley Lakes of East Africa. The total population size of flamingos
   in the Tanzanian lakes surveyed was approximate to 907,000. The largest
   concentrations in Tanzania were found in Lake Natron and Embagai Crater
   Lake. Although flamingos are known to breed in Lake Natron, no evidence
   of breeding was observed during the survey. The total estimate for the
   southern Kenya and northern Tanzania Rift Valley was approximate to 28
   million. Trends in flamingo populations, survey methodology, and future
   monitoring needs are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{1. This paper examines the effectiveness of New Zealand's Resource
   Management Act in managing freshwater resources.
   2. A distinctive feature of the New Zealand situation is the extent to
   which Parliament has delegated the sustainable management of freshwater
   resources to catchment based regional councils. Regional councils
   exercise a pivotal role in water resource planning but without much
   guidance or technical assistance from central government.
   3. Contrary to New Zealand's `clean green' image, water pollution is
   alarmingly high in relation to its small population size. The Act puts
   particular emphasis on improving water quality by empowering regional
   councils to address this concern in policy statements and plans.
   4. Water allocation policies in New Zealand are dominated by a
   supply-oriented biophysical perspective based on prescribing minimum
   flows and maximum extraction thresholds to safeguard the life-supporting
   capacity of ecosystems. Despite persistent attempts by central
   government to encourage regional councils to adopt competitive tendering
   and tradable permits for allocating water, most regional councils favour
   allocation procedures based on community consultation and political
   compromise.
   5. Water Conservation Orders are a special provision in the Act for
   protecting outstanding amenity or intrinsic values of waters in their
   natural state. However, no new applications have been made under the RMA
   since 1991.
   6. The RMA has brought about significant procedural improvements in
   water resource planning, by means of a cooperative, consultative
   approach. However, limited attention has been given to issues of water
   allocation to promote the sustainable use of increasingly scarce
   resources. The policies and rules in recently notified plans now
   regulate point source as well as non-point source discharges.
   Nevertheless, central government may need to reassess its role if it
   wishes to achieve a significant improvement in water quality and there
   needs to be greater coordination of water resource monitoring systems
   operated by regional councils to provide a national overview. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Recent analyses have revealed trends over the past 20-30 years of
   decreasing sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean coincident with warming
   trends. Such trends may be indicative of the polar amplification of
   warning predicted for the next several decades in response to increasing
   atmospheric CO,, We have summarized these predictions and nonuniform
   patterns of arctic climate change in order to address their potential
   effects on marine mammals. Since recent trends in sea ice extent are
   nonuniform, the direct and indirect effects on marine mammals are
   expected to vary geographically. Changes in the extent and concentration
   of sea ice may alter the seasonal distributions, geographic ranges,
   patterns of mi,migration, nutritional status, reproductive success, and
   ultimately the abundance and stock structure of some species.
   Ice-associated seals, which rely on suitable ice substrate for resting,
   pupping, and molting, may be especially vulnerable to such changes. As
   recent decreases in ice coverage have been more extensive in the
   Siberian Arctic (60 degrees E-180 degrees E) than in the Beaufort Sea
   and western sectors, we speculate that marine mammal populations in the
   Siberian Arctic may be among the first to experience climate-induced
   geographic shifts or altered reproductive capacity due to persistent
   changes in ice extent. Alteration in the extent and productivity of
   ice-edge systems may affect the density and distribution of important
   ice-associated prey elf marine mammals, such as arctic cod Boreogadus
   saida and sympagic,aic ({''}with ice{''}) amphipods. Present climate
   models, however, are insufficient to predict regional ice dynamics,
   winds, mesoscale features, and mechanisms of nutrient resupply, which
   must be known to predict productivity and trophic response. Therefore,
   it is critical that mesoscale process-oriented studies identify the
   biophysical coupling required to maintain suitable prey availability and
   ice-associated habitat fur marine mammals on regional arctic scales,
   Only an integrated ecosystems approach can address the complexity of
   factors determining productivity and cascading trophic dynamics in a
   warmer Arctic. This approach, integrated with monitoring of key
   indicator species (e.g., bowhead whale, ringed seal, and beluga). should
   be a high priority.}},

Abstract = {{The regional atmospheric deposition patterns of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Hg, Mo,
   Sb and Tl have been mapped in a 188,000 km(2) area of the European
   Arctic (N Finland, N Norway, NW Russia) using the moss technique. The
   Russian nickel mining and smelting industry (Nikel and Zapoljarnij
   (Pechenganikel) and Monchegorsk (Severonikel)) in the eastern part of
   the survey area represents two of the largest point sources for SO, and
   metal emissions on a world wide basis. In contrast, parts of northern
   Finland and northern Norway represent still some of the most pristine
   areas in Europe. The terrestrial mosses Hylocomium splendens and
   Pleurozium schreberi were used as monitors of airborne deposition.
   Samples in all three countries were collected during the summer of 1995
   and analysed in one laboratory using ICP-MS. Maps for most elements
   clearly show elevated element concentrations near the industrial sites
   and delineate the extent of contamination. Pollution follows the main
   wind and topographical directions in the area (N-S). The gradients of
   deposition are rather steep. Background levels for all the elements are
   reached within 150-200 km from the industrial plants. The relative
   importance of long-range atmospheric transport of air pollutants from
   industrial point sources on the world wide increase of heavy metals
   observed in the atmosphere is thus debatable for many elements.
   Increasing population and traffic density, accompanied by increasing
   local dust levels, may play a much more important role than industrial
   emissions. The regional distribution patterns as displayed in the maps
   show some striking differences between the elements. The regional
   distribution of Hg and TI in the survey area is completely dominated by
   sources other than industry. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Sticky traps, water traps and leaf samples were used to monitor aphid
   populations at 32 sites in southwestern Australia between October and
   May for four seasons between 1988-92. Twenty-seven sites were located in
   potato, So(anum tuberosum L., crops, with five others located in mixed
   vegetable crops or pastures. Sites were located in an area of
   approximately 90,000 km(2), and encompassed most of the potato growing
   areas of the region. Thirty-four species of aphids were detected.
   Potato-colonising aphids found were Myzus persicae, Aulacorthum solani,
   Macrosiphum euphorbiae and Aphis craccivora. M. persicae was the most
   widespread, and its seasonal distribution in southwestern Australia is
   presented. Fewer M. persicae were recorded and it arrived later in the
   season for 2 of 3 years at southern sites than northern sites. At sites
   where both sticky traps and leaf sampling were used, leaf sampling often
   detected M. persicae before they were found on traps. Results suggest
   that potato crops grown on the southern coast will be least vulnerable
   to infection by aphid-borne viruses.}},

Abstract = {{During 1992-4, square (30 x 30 cm) sticky traps of various colours were
   used on a commercial cotton farm to trap adults of Coccinella
   transversalis and Adalia bipunctata which are both major predators of
   Helicoverpa spp. Both insects were attracted most to yellow traps which
   also reflected the most visible light between 500 nm and 600 nm (where
   green foliage reflects most light). When yellow was diluted with white
   to produce yellow-white hues, the light reflected between 500 nm and 600
   nm was reduced and the numbers of C. transversalis and A. bipunctata
   adults caught on these traps were also significantly reduced. This
   suggests that C. transversalis and A. bipunctata adults can discriminate
   foliage-like hues (500-580 nm) from non-foliage-like hues (< 500 nm and
   > 580 nm) and are attracted to colours that suggest the foliage of host
   plants that may harbour their prey. Yellow sticky traps placed 25-50 cm
   above ground caught significantly more C. transversalis and A.
   bipunctata adults than those placed at 75-150 cm and are the most
   appropriate traps to monitor populations of C. transversalis and A.
   bipunctata adults in cotton farms.}},

Abstract = {{A field trial was conducted to test the efficacy of an oil formulation
   of the entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium flavoviride Gams \& Rozsypal
   (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes), as a control agent for the desert
   locust, Schistocerca gregaria Forskal (Orthoptera: Acrididae), in
   Mauritania. The treatment was applied to hopper bands in the field. In
   caged samples of the treated insects, 99\% mortality was observed in 15
   days. On average during application only 51\% of the hoppers received
   spray droplets directly, the additional mortality being due to pick-up
   of spores from the splay residue. This mortality was assessed by
   exposing insects to a treated plot at intervals, and monitoring disease
   levels during subsequent incubation in cages. The spray residue remained
   highly infective for a period of 6 days after application. The number of
   nymphs in the hopper bands was estimated using a computer-based
   photographic image-processing technique. Unfortunately, most of the
   hopper bands dispersed into small groups, but a population reduction
   could be demonstrated for one hopper band. Maximal daily mortality in
   the field was observed 10-11 days after application, compared with 6-10
   days in cages.}},

Abstract = {{There are several applications for which one might monitor avian
   communities but one of the main ones is to evaluate the impact of an
   anthropogenic disturbance (e.g. logging). There has been relatively
   little attention paid to how sensitive such monitoring might be to
   sampling strategy, which refers to the temporal frequency and spatial
   extent over which the monitoring is conducted rather than the actual
   method by which the data are collected (i.e. strip transect, point
   counts, etc.). By using data collected during 92 visits spaced over
   three successive years at one site, 48 different sampling strategies
   (Schedules') are emulated by using resampling techniques to investigate
   the sensitivity of outcomes to transect size (3 classes, approximate to
   17, approximate to 34, approximate to 50 ha) and sampling intensity
   (once-off one of more times per season; one, two or three years).
   Sensitivity is gauged by reference to the accuracy of estimates of
   species richness and the maximum total density. A key point is that the
   analyses are to be based only on species recorded in the pre-impact
   phases of the monitoring; thus, losses of species or individuals of
   these species cannot be offset or obscured by increases in
   disturbance-tolerant or exotic species when judging whether there has
   been a deleterious impact. For the kind of forest and avian community
   considered here, single-visit, surveys performed uniformly badly on
   every criterion, while results for the smallest spatial extents (
   approximate to 17 ha) deviated greatly from outcomes for larger
   transects. A recommended sampling schedule derived from these analyses
   is two visits every season for two successive years at the largest
   spatial extent (i.e. eight visits at approximate to 50 ha). This would
   form the basis by which to assess `significant' declines in richness or
   maximum total density, with the entire survey repeated prior to and
   following the putative impact. These assessments require the calculation
   of the magnitudes of declines that might arise by chance from sampling
   the unperturbed community and corresponding power estimates for
   specified changes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   there was concordance between the two methods. All incompatible strains
   exhibited different RAPD profiles whilst compatible ones, with two
   exceptions, had the same RAPD profile. Somatic incompatibility tests and
   RAPD profiles generated by three primers, from which 11 markers were
   retained, could distinguish field-tested strains from among 60 strains
   from a population collected in Quebec and Ontario. Furthermore, both
   methods allowed us to clearly demonstrate the presence of inoculated
   strains 1 year after treatment. The combined use of these techniques
   provides a valuable tool for discriminating between different P.

Abstract = {{Using an enclosure experiment, we tested whether substrate selection by
   deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), redback voles (Clethrionomys
   gapperi), and woodland jumping mice (Napaeozapus insignis) matched
   habitat-use patterns determined from trapping data. Mice were introduced
   into a 5 m diameter enclosure containing substrates from three habitats:
   maple, mixed, and coniferous forest. Trapping data were taken from a
   long-term monitoring study of small-mammal populations in Algonquin
   Park, Ontario. We used data from 1991-1995 from the three habitats used
   in the enclosure experiment. If competition or predation affects habitat
   distribution patterns. then, given a choice, mice should select
   different substrates in the enclosures from those they use in the field.
   Alternatively, if habitat use is not constrained by interactions with
   competitors or predators (i.e., if small mammals select habitats), then
   habitats used in the enclosure should match habitat distributions
   observed in the field. Habitats used in the field did not match habitats
   selected in the enclosure experiment for either deer mice or woodland
   jumping mice. Redback voles selected habitats similar to those used in
   the field. We conclude that interspecific competition and (or) predation
   may limit availability of habitats for deer mice and woodland jumping
   mice.}},

Abstract = {{Perch, Perca fluviatilis, of different sizes and ages were allowed to
   choose between two feeding patches differing in food ratio and (or)
   predation risk (presence versus absence of a pike, Esox lucius). The aim
   of our study was to test whether food-patch choice and risk-taking
   behaviour (time with the predator present) were related to size,
   phenotype (fast-versus slow-growing) and (or) stage of development
   (mature versus immature). Movements of individual fish were continuously
   monitored with an automatic system employing passive integrated
   transponder (PIT) tags. Food distribution did not seem to be important
   in determining perch distribution. Predation risk, however, had a
   significant influence. The presence of a predator in a patch
   significantly reduced the proportion of time spent in that feeding patch
   by all perch. However, the strength of this effect was dependent on
   individual characteristics, both the slow-growing phenotype and the
   mature fish spending a significantly lower proportion of time in the
   risky patch than the fast-growing and immature fish. Switching rates,
   which differed between character groups, also had an effect on growth
   rate, varying with predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{Although many authors have used thread trailing to monitor movements of
   turtles and other vertebrates, most have evaluated only a portion of the
   information contained in these pathways. We describe ways of extracting
   information from thread trails by determining length of trail, mean
   distance moved per unit time, net displacement, area encompassed by the
   trail, mean turning angle, and mean vector length. We further describe
   and compare four measures of trail sinuosity, the ratio of greatest
   distance to length of path (d/L), the square root of the ratio of area
   to path length (root A/L), fractal dimension (D), and sinuosity (S); we
   then applied these methods to the trails of a population of ornate box
   turtles (Terrapene ornata) from the Nebraska Sand Hills. Though
   preliminary, these data suggest that vegetation cover affects the
   sinuosity of turtle trails (based on D), that temperature affects the
   mean distance moved per day, that T. ornata ordinarily show little or no
   directional bias. and that injury can affect distance moved, trail
   sinuosity, and mean turning angle. Among these measures of trail
   sinuosity, D and S are highly correlated and provide similar
   information. Though less closely correlated with D and S. or with each
   other, root A/L and d/L also reflect trail sinuosity; of these indices.
   however, d/L best reflects trail directionality. This analysis suggests
   that a more comprehensive evaluation of pathways at this fine scale will
   provide new insights into the routine movements of animals.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory studies have shown that incubation environments can affect
   morphological and behavioral phenotypes of hatchling lizards, but the
   relevance of this result to natural populations remains unclear. We
   monitored thermal regimes during the incubation period in 19 natural
   nests of scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) in montane southeastern
   Australia, and experimentally translocated eggs among nests to remove
   the confounding of `'nest of origin'' (including genetic) factors with
   incubation conditions. We removed the eggs from the field shortly before
   hatching, and assessed the hatchlings' phenotypes (body size, shape,
   locomotor performance). Most of the effects seen after laboratory
   incubation were also seen after incubation in natural nests. Hatchling
   phenotypes were affected by incubation conditions as well as by `'nest
   of origin'' factors and an interaction between the two. Both the mean
   and the variance of incubation temperatures affected hatchling
   phenotypes, with male and female hatchlings differing in their norms of
   reaction. We found no evidence that a female's choice of nest site
   depends on the specific norms of reaction of her own offspring. Overall,
   incubation temperatures induced approximately half as much variance in
   hatchling phenotypes as did `'nest-of-origin'' effects. We conclude that
   incubation-induced phenotypic plasticity in hatchling reptiles may be
   important in the natural environment, as well as in the laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Blood and environmental samples, including a quarterly G-day duplicate
   diet, for nine mother/child pairs from Eastern Europe have been
   monitored for 12 to > 24 months with high precision stable lead isotope
   analysis to evaluate the changes that occur when the subjects moved from
   one environment. (Eastern Europe) to another with different stable lead
   isotopes (Australia). The children were between 6 and 11 years of age
   and the mothers were between 29 and 37 pars of age. These data were
   compared with an Australian control mother/child pair, aged 31 and 6
   years, respectively. A rationale for undertaking this study of
   mother/child pairs was to evaluate if there were differences in the
   patterns and clearance rates of lead from blood in children compared
   with their mothers. Blood lead concentrations ranged from 2.1 to 3.9 mu
   g/dl in the children and between 1.8 and 4.5 mu g/dl in the mothers, but
   the mean of differences between each mother and her child did not differ
   significantly from zero, Duplicate diets contained from 2.4 to 31.8 mu g
   Pb/kg diet; the mean +/- standard deviation was 5.5 +/- 2.1 mu g Pb/kg
   and total daily dietary intakes ranged from 1.6 to 21.3 mu g/day. Mean
   daily dietary intakes relative to body weight showed that the intake fur
   children was approximately double that for the mothers (0.218 vs, 0.113
   mu g Pb/kg body weight/day), The correlations between blood lead
   concentration and mean daily dietary intake either relative to body
   weight or total dietary intake did not reach statistical significance
   (p>0.05), Estimation of the lead coming from skeletal (endogenous)
   sources relative to the contribution from environmental (exogenous)
   sources ranges from 8 to 70\% for the mothers and 12 to 66\% for the
   children. The difference between mothers and children is not
   statistically significant (p = 0.28). The children do not appear to
   achieve the Australian lead isotopic profile at a faster rate than their
   mothers, These data provide evidence that the absorption or uptake of
   lead from dietary sources is similar in adult females and children of
   the age in this study. In spire of lower bone lead and faster bone
   remodeling and recycling in children compared with adult females, we see
   no differences between the mothers and their children in overall
   contribution of tissue lead to blood lead, Results from this study
   suggest that fractional absorption of ingested lead by children 6-11
   years of age is comparable with absorption patterns observed among adult
   females in the 29-37-year-old age range. Because pharmacokinetic models
   apply a 40-50\% absorption even for a 7-year-old children, further
   investigations on fractional absorption of ingested lead Ly young
   children are warranted. Further investigations are especially needed in
   younger children than those who were subjects in the current study,
   particularly children in the 1-3-year-old age range. In addition, the
   effect of nutritional status and patterns of food intake on children's
   lead absorption require investigation, particularly given the increased
   prevalence of marginal nutritional status among low-income populations
   that are at increased risk of elevated elevated blood lead levels.}},

Abstract = {{Exceptional elevation of children's leukemia appearing 5 years after the
   1983 startup of the Krummel nuclear power plant, accompanied by a
   significant increase of adult leukemia cases, led to investigations of
   radiation exposures of the population living near the plant. The rate of
   dicentric chromosomes in peripheral blood lymphocytes of seven parents
   of children with leukemia and in 14 other inhabitants near the plant was
   significantly elevated and indicated ongoing exposures over the years of
   its operation. These findings led to the hypothesis that chronic reactor
   leakages had occurred. This assumption is supported by identification of
   artificial radioactivity in air, rainwater, soil, and vegetation by the
   environmental monitoring program at the nuclear power plant.
   Calculations of the corresponding source terms show that emissions must
   have been well above authorized annual limits. Bone marrow doses
   supposedly result primarily through incorporation of bone-seeking beta-
   and alpha-emitters.}},

Abstract = {{We constructed job-exposure profiles and assessed quality of health care
   in 39 of 47 current and former workers from a nuclear installation in
   the Negev whose files were referred to us for assessment of a possible
   work-related aspect of their tumors. The workers, all male except one,
   began employment at various times from the reactor construction and were
   engaged in different tasks in laboratory research, construction,
   maintenance, and service. Of those workers still living the average age
   was 57.9 years, with a range from 42 to 77 years of age. The average age
   at the time of death for the deceased workers was 57.3 years, with a
   range from 41 to 69 years of age. information on past exposures to
   radiation and chemical agents came from employee records, dosimetry, and
   interviews. Personal monitoring (urine assays) in 29 workers indicated
   the presence of various radionuclides, with higher levels found in
   persons with work histories in laboratory/research and development and
   technical/inspector job categories compared to those in
   administrative/service job categories. Among the 39 workers, latency
   between onset of exposure and first appearance of illness from tumor was
   24.2 years, with a range of 5 to 34 years. Tumor distribution for these
   workers was as follows. hematolymphatic (n=11 workers), gastrointestinal
   (n=9), breast (n=1 {[}male]), brain (n=1), renal-urogenital (n=8), skin
   (n=1), and pulmonary (n=8 {[}5 known smokers]). For all tumors except
   those of the respiratory tract, the first diagnosis was made more
   frequently in those patients under the age of 55. Observed/expected
   comparisons for tumor proportional incidence showed excess fractions of
   blood tumors in persons <55 and >55 years of age. Ratios were greater
   than unity for blood, breast (n=1), gastrointestinal, and urogenital
   tumors in patients <55 years of age and pulmonary tumors in persons >55
   years of age. The odds ratio for smoking history in patients with lung
   tumors compared to those with other tumors was 4.8. Nonmalignant
   conditions appeared at relatively younger ages. After the exposure
   episodes two children with major congenital anomalies were born to wives
   of the workers; one anomaly was fatal. Not ail patients were first
   diagnosed for cancer following referral from the plant medical service,
   and delays between warning signs and symptoms and medical evaluation
   occurred in some. Although we lacked data on cancer incidence and
   population at risk, our findings suggest that earlier official
   assessments of risk should be reconsidered. There is a need for
   population-based monitoring of risk to nuclear industry workers,
   external quality control of their medical surveillance and care, and
   improvements in information delivery.}},

Abstract = {{The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a system of
   collaborating centers known as the Radiation Emergency Medical
   Preparedness and Assistance Network (REMPAN) to promote radiation
   emergency medical preparedness, assistance, and advice to countries in
   cases of overexposure of populations from any source of radiation. This
   network consists of 13 specialized institutions located in 10 countries.
   Within the REMPAN there are three separate but linked activities. The
   first is aimed at strengthening radiation emergency medical preparedness
   and assistance to treat and monitor acutely exposed individuals. The
   second activity is directed toward improving public health advice to
   mitigate long-term effects of exposure to low and protracted doses that
   might accrue in populations living in the affected territories. This
   involves giving advice on protecting public health, e.g., iodine
   prophylaxis, psychosocial risks associated with countermeasures, and
   public information strategies. In addition, the REMPAN develops
   activities aimed at improving long-term follow-up studies and
   preparedness for epidemiologic investigations in territories
   contaminated by radionuclides from a nuclear accident. The WHO's
   response in a radiation emergency depends on the type of accident and
   its lime phase. This includes a wide range of actions from studying the
   situation to providing medical and public health assistance through the
   network of collaborating centers and relevant institutions within the
   REMPAN. The process of creating a reliable international system for
   radiation emergency medical preparedness and assistance has not yet been
   completed. Deficiencies in this system are outlined in this paper to
   attract the attention of specialists in the field of radiation
   protection and potential donors of the WHO program.}},

Abstract = {{In estimating the cancer mortality risk for radiation workers it is
   conventional to use data obtained from the populations exposed to
   radiation as a result of the atomic bomb blast in Hiroshima and
   Nagasaki. This A-bomb experience resulted in relatively high doses of
   radiation and short periods of exposure. The availability of systematic
   analyses of the mortality of workers at the Hanford plant (Washington
   slate) provides a more realistic basis for individual risk estimates. We
   present the data for three functions that in combination provide useful
   guidelines for occupational cancer mortality risk. These functions are a
   relationship between age at exposure, latency between exposure and
   death, and a dose-response function. Although other estimates of such
   functions are possible using different populations and assumptions, we
   offer these functions as guidelines for individual cancer risk
   evaluation based on our analyses of the Hanford data.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental assessment and monitoring is not limited to measuring
   quantities of some substances that threaten our existence. At present
   the greatest challenge is not to gain another decimal point in assaying
   a certain noxious chemical. As far as technical aspects of monitoring
   are concerned, we witness a steady progress. Our conceptual development
   is less tangible. At the same time it is more urgent. We are directed to
   assess and monitor novel characteristics such as biodiversity and
   ecosystem health. They are considered to be the basis of modern,
   ecosystem management. Specialists in wildlife, fisheries, soil
   scientists, agronomists, and foresters are revising the established
   tenets of their disciplines to pursue maximum biodiversity. This could
   be done only if we know what biodiversity and ecosystem health are. This
   paper assesses the state of our knowledge of these concepts.}},

Abstract = {{An in situ biological treatment technique designed to destroy
   trichloroethylene (TCE) runs demonstrated at field scale at a
   manufacturing facility in the Midwest. Air and methane were injected
   into the contaminated groundwater through a vertical sparge well, while
   air was extracted from the vadose zone though a well screened In the
   unsaturated zone. A mobile demonstration test trailer housing air
   injection compressor, soil venting blower, and methane injection
   equipment was used to allow rapid equipment deployment, setup, and
   demobilization. Air and methane act to stimulate indigenous
   microorganisms to degrade TCE and dichloroethylene (DCE) via aerobic
   cometabolism. Toxic degradation products, such as vinyl chloride, are
   not generated by methanotrophic cometabolism.
   The demonstration tons conducted over a three-month time period, with
   groundwater and soil gas monitored weekly for several chemical and
   microbiological parameters. The lest successfully stimulated the
   methanotroph population to increase over one order of magnitude and soil
   gas carbon dioxide (a by-product of biodegradation) concentrations to
   increase when methane tons injected into the aquifer. In addition,
   groundwater volatile organic compounds were reduced by 60 to 80 percent
   in the groundwater monitoring wells that were sampled.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate analysis of contaminant data from a multi-year monitoring
   program demonstrates alterations in the hepatic chemistry of metals in
   fish exposed to organic contaminants. Metals (Ag As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn,
   Ni, Pb, Se, Sn, Zn) and organic chemicals (PCBs, DDTs, chlordanes,
   dieldrins, PAHs) were measured in liver and associated sediments for
   winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) from 23 sites along the
   northeast Atlantic coast and for Atlantic croaker (Micropogomias
   undulatus) from 30 sites along the southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
   coasts of the United States. Concentrations of habitat contaminants
   varied from nil to levels signifying important anthropogenic inputs and
   thus provided a range in chronic exposures and related contaminant
   stress levels with which to investigate the response of hepatic
   chemistry in fish representative of viable populations. The data,
   analyzed by principal component, principal component regression, and
   biplot procedures, demonstrated an opposing relationship between
   micronutrient elements, principally Zn, and exposure to organic
   contaminants in winter flounder. This relationship was not present in
   Atlantic croaker that were resident in less contaminated habitats. Based
   on median concentrations in sediment, exposure of winter pounder to
   important organic contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, DDTs) exceeded that for Atlantic croaker by 7
   to 50 times. Coincident with depletion of hepatic Zn and Cd in winter
   pounder was accumulation of Hg and Ag. My results, in agreement with
   those of others, implicate the negative effects of hepatic
   detoxification of organic contaminants on metal binding in liver, which
   can cause depletion of essential elements while contaminant and
   potentially toxic elements accumulate.}},

Abstract = {{The Lake Michigan fish community has been monitored since the 1960s with
   bottom trawls, and since the late 1980s with acoustics and midwater
   trawls. These sampling tools are limited to different habitats: bottom
   trawls sample fish near bottom in areas with smooth substrates, and
   acoustic methods sample fish throughout the water column above all
   substrate types. We compared estimates of fish densities and species
   richness from daytime bottom trawling with those estimated from
   night-time acoustic and midwater trawling at a range of depths in
   northeastern Lake Michigan in summer 1995. We examined estimates of
   total fish density as well as densities of alewife Alosa pseudoharengus
   (Wilson), bloater Coregonus hoyi (Gill), and rainbow smelt Osmerus
   mordax: (Mitchell) because these three species are the dominant forage
   of large piscivores in Lake Michigan. In shallow water (18 m), we
   detected more species but fewer fish (in fish/ha and kg/ha) with bottom
   trawls than with acoustic-midwater trawling. Large aggregations of
   rainbow smelt were detected by acoustic-midwater trawling at 18 m and
   contributed to the differences in total fish density estimates between
   gears at this depth. Numerical and biomass densities of bloaters from
   all depths were significantly higher when based on bottom trawl samples
   than on acoustic-midwater trawling, and this probably contributed to the
   observed significant difference between methods for total fish densities
   (kg/ha) at 55 m. Significantly fewer alewives per ha were estimated from
   bottom trawling than from acoustics-midwater trawling at 55 m, and in
   deeper waters, no alewives were taken by bottom trawling. The
   differences detected between gears resulted from alewife, bloater, and
   rainbow smelt vertical distributions, which varied with lake depth and
   time of day. Because Lake Michigan fishes are both demersal and pelagic,
   a single sampling method cannot be used to completely describe
   characteristics of the fish community. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Phenology and growth of Papaver radicatum Rottb. was monitored over four
   summers (1990-1993) at 12 sites, along a dolomitic and a granitic
   altitudinal gradient (330 m a.s.l.-770 m a.s.l.) at Sverdrup Pass,
   central Ellesmere Island, Canada. The gradients provided substantial
   differences in environmental characteristics. Three of the four seasons
   (1990, 1991 and 1993) had more than 400 thawing degree-days (TDD) in the
   valley, while the 1992 season had less than 300. The granitic sites had
   consistently higher temperatures than the dolomitic sites, despite their
   northerly aspect. Increasing elevation reduced total degree-day
   accumulation (c. 40 degree-days/100 m) and length of potential growing
   season. The proportion of the population producing flower buds was
   similar at all sites in any given year, but there were differences among
   years. Production of flowers and fruits per site, decreased with
   altitude along the dolomitic gradient in 1991 and 1992. There was no
   difference in the number of buds or flowers produced per plant with
   increasing altitude, although larger plants with multiple flowers were
   found only on low elevation granitic sites. Plants from the dolomitic
   sites were smaller and flowered, on average, after the site accumulated
   150 degree-days, while plants on the granitic sites were larger and
   bloomed after 200 degree-days. Papaver is able to grow and reproduce
   over a wide range of environmental conditions and moderate climate
   warming would likely promote its growth and establishment, unless other
   factors, especially snow-free periods and water availability, become
   limiting.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit yield, codling moth (Cydia pomonella) damage, and plum curculio
   (Conotrachelus nenuphar) damage were monitored over an 8-year period in
   a 0.5-ha, biologically-managed apple orchard in southwestern Michigan.
   The relationship between yield and damage was examined for both of these
   pests. The orchard showed clear biennial bearing patterns of alternating
   high and low yields. A significant negative correlation was found for
   yield and percentage damage by codling moth but not for plum curculio
   damage. However, the estimated amount of fruit damaged by codling moth
   remained relatively stable over the period, indicating that changes in
   percentage damage depended on yield dynamics rather than changes in
   codling moth abundance. In contrast, the amount of fruit damaged by plum
   curculio showed biennial fluctuations and a positive correlation with
   yield, indicating that the population of this pest was capable of
   responding with increased oviposition in years with greater fruit yield.
   In addition, a comparison of codling moth fruit injury in years with and
   without the use of pheromone mating disruption showed no statistically
   significant reduction in damage as a result of using this method,
   suggesting that the orchard may be too small or codling moth populations
   too high for effective use of this management tactic.}},

   monitored to show changes in the proportions of wild and escaped
   cultured salmon entering the river. Wild salmon numbers steadily
   declined over 5 years, whereas cultured salmon numbers generally
   increased. Cultured salmon entered the river later than wild salmon and
   the majority of cultured salmon were sexually immature. Present ratios
   of multi-sea-winter to one-sea-winter for wild salmon are 0.4:1,
   compared with 2:1 a decade earlier. Eggs were sampled from 20 redds in
   the Magaguadavic River in 1993. Analysis of carotenoid pigments revealed
   that 45\% of the redds were made by females of definite wild origin, at
   least 20\% by females of definite cultured origin, and the remaining
   35\% contained eggs with pigments indicating a possibility of cultured
   origin. Thus, redds of cultured escapees could be as high as 55\% of the
   total examined. The location of the Magaguadavic River, and the
   availability of data on wild and cultured salmon in the river dating
   back to 1992, make this an ideal site for a Canadian reference river to
   monitor interactions between wild and cultured salmon.}},

Abstract = {{Although an increasing number of natural fish populations are being
   contaminated by exogenous immigrants, knowledge is poor regarding the
   genetic changes expected to occur in a wild stock once an introgression
   has taken place. One reason for this lack of knowledge appears to be
   that the theory for the genetic dynamics is poorly developed and
   complicated for age-structured populations with overlapping generations.
   Using newly developed theory and results from computer simulations, the
   genetic aspects of age-structured populations with overlapping
   generations are discussed, especially the detection of contamination and
   the genetic dynamics following hybridization. When generations overlap,
   the amount of temporal allele frequency shift is generally larger than
   for a population of equal genetically effective size with discrete
   generations. This is even more pronounced for the separate cohorts than
   for the population as a whole. Therefore, when testing for temporal
   genetic heterogeneity, a higher frequency of statistically significant
   results may be expected than can be explained by genetic drift caused by
   a restricted effective population size. During introgression, a sudden
   infusion of new genes initiates marked allele frequency fluctuations,
   and in salmonids this ``genetic instability{''} may persist for several
   decades. In spite of these potentially dramatic fluctuations, even a
   massive influx of exogenous genes may be very difficult to detect,
   particularly in the absence of genetic and demographic monitoring data
   from the natural population prior to immigration. A conservative
   attitude is recommended when interpreting allele frequency differences
   within populations where the history and the demographic characteristics
   are poorly known. The risk of incorrect interpretations is particularly
   apparent for many salmonid species where only a subset of the existing
   age classes may be available for sampling. (C) 1997 International

Abstract = {{1. Feral pigs prey upon newborn lambs in the semi-arid rangelands of
   eastern Australia. In this study, two experiments were used to
   investigate the relationship between feral pig density and the rate of
   lamb predation. The differential susceptibility of single and twin-born
   lambs to pig predation was also examined.
   2. In Experiment 1, the density of pig populations on four sites
   subjected to different levels of pig control was monitored quarterly
   (range: 0.7-6.4 pigs km(-2)) between 1989 and 1991. The rate of lamb
   loss was indexed by udder-scoring a sample of lambing ewes to estimate
   the proportion whose lambs had died. The index of lamb loss varied
   significantly with pig density, the relationship taking the form of an
   asymptotic increase in loss at progressively higher pig densities.
   Inclusion of a variable indicating whether pig density increased or
   decreased over the lambing season (summarizing the cumulative effects of
   recent seasonal conditions) explained no additional variation in lamb
   loss. This suggests that the availability of alternative foods did not
   influence the propensity of pigs to prey upon lambs.
   3. Experiment 2 was conducted on three sites with respective pig
   densities of 0.4, 2.4 and 5.8 pigs km(-2). On each site, two paddocks
   were established, one of which was electrically fenced to preclude pigs.
   Approximately 300 pregnant ewes at each site were ultrasonically scanned
   to determine whether they carried single or twin lambs, and then placed
   randomly in either the paddock to which pigs had access or the paddock
   from which they were excluded. The proportion of lambs born that
   survived was contrasted between the two paddocks at each site to provide
   a direct estimate of predation rate. The rate of lamb predation
   increased with feral pig density, reaching a maximum proportional rate
   of 0.29 on the site where pig density was highest. Comparison of
   predation rates indicated that twin lambs were on average 5-6 times more
   likely to be preyed upon by pigs than were single lambs.
   4. The relationship between pig density and the index of predation rate
   estimated in Experiment 1 was modified to predict actual predation rates
   by substituting the maximum rate measured in Experiment 2. The resulting
   relationship, in combination with a measure of stochastic year-to-year
   variation in predation rates, was used to construct distributions
   describing the probability of sustaining different rates of lamb
   predation at given feral pig densities.
   5. This information enables sheep farmers to contrast the risk of lamb
   predation with their lamb production objectives and the costs of holding
   feral pig density below levels corresponding to acceptable rates of lamb
   predation. By valuing the reduced risk of sustaining high levels of lamb
   predation and the costs associated with achieving it, a sheep farmer can
   incorporate reduction in costs and benefits of pig control directly into
   economic analyses used to manage their enterprise.}},

Abstract = {{Obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), larvae from
   a commercial apple orchard in western New York State were 36.8-fold,
   2.5-fold, and 5.2-fold more tolerant to azinphosmethyl, chlorpyrifos,
   and esfenvalerate, respectively, when compared with larvae collected
   from untreated habitats. However, this relationship was not the same for
   male and female moths from the same locations treated with the same
   insecticides. Female moths were more tolerant to all insecticides than
   were males. Field applications of azinphosmethyl and chlorpyrifos did
   not reduce fruit damage at harvest compared with the untreated control.
   However, only 3\% fruit damage occurred in plots treated with
   esfenvalerate. These results suggest that larvae in the commercial apple
   orchards in western New York are resistant to azinphosmethyl and
   chlorpyrifos. Despite the 5.2-fold resistance level recorded for
   esfenvalerate, field applications of this insecticide still provide
   commercially acceptable control.}},

Abstract = {{Baseline information on the biotypic status of Russian wheat aphid,
   Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov). populations in the United States prior to
   the commercial planting of Russian wheat aphid-resistant small grains is
   reported. Ten Russian wheat aphid clones, collected from 5 states, were
   evaluated for biotypic variation on 4 wheat, Triticum aestivum L., and 2
   barley, Hordeum vulgare L., germplasm entries. Although minor
   statistical differences were detected in measurements of chlorosis, root
   weight, aphid numbers, and aphid weight among some crones, host
   responses to Russian wheat aphid infestation among the 10 clones were
   similar. No genotypic differences were detected among the aphid clones
   based on random amplified polymorphic DNA profiles. Ten years after its
   introduction to the United States and before the commercial release of
   resistant cultivars, the Russian wheat aphid has not exhibited biotypic
   variation like that found in another cereal aphid, Schizaphis graminum
   (Rondani). It has been previously shown that Russian wheat aphid
   populations from other parts of the world exhibit considerable biotypic
   variation. Thus, with the threat of future introductions into the United
   States. Russian wheat aphid should be periodically monitored for
   biotypic variation, before and after the deployment of resistant
   cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{We located two populations of endangered Aplomado Falcons
   (Falcofemmalis) in desert grasslands in north-central Mexico in 1992.
   During spring 1993, we quantified breeding success, habitat use, and
   prey selection by the easternmost population, which is located 40 km
   from the United States. We captured 17 individuals (one subadult male,
   seven adult males, three subadult females, six adult females) and placed
   tail-mounted radio transmitters on 15 of them. Females weighed 50\%
   more, had tails 9\% longer, and had wing chords 11\% longer than males.
   Breeding season ranges of six radio-tagged individuals monitored more
   than 100 d ranged from 3.3-21.4 km(2). Woody plant density ranged from
   11.2-139.5/ha and percentage of ground-cover ranged from 28.9-69.5\% in
   ten falcon territories. Six of seven nests were in yuccas (Yucca elata,
   Y. torreyi). Seven nesting pairs had a mean clutch size of 2.6, mean
   hatching success of 1.6, and a mean fledging success of 0.6. We
   identified 87 prey items from pellets, prey remains, and observed
   successful hunts; 82 were avian and 5 were insect. Meadowlarks
   (Sturnella spp.) were most abundant on potential prey transects and in
   the diet of Aplomado Falcons. Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater),
   Greater Roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) and hummingbirds
   (Trochilidae) were identified in diets, but were not detected on
   transects.}},

Abstract = {{Caiman crocodilus crocodilus and Melanosuchus niger occur throughout
   most of the Anavilhanas Archipelago, located in the lower Rio Negro,
   Central Amazonia. The observed densities of these species vary from 0 to
   58 per km of shoreline and 0 to 8 per km of shoreline, respectively.
   Multiple regression analysis indicated that the temperature difference
   between the water and the air, and water depth affected the observed
   density of C. crocodilus during spotlight surveys in the Archipelago.
   Percentage illumination by the moon, cloud cover, frequency of
   occurrence of grass, and food availability did not significantly affect
   the observed density of C. crocodilus.
   Nine hatchling groups of M. Niger that hatched in 1992 were found on
   islands near the north bank of the Rio Negro, and 15 of 20 hatchlings
   groups of C. crocodilus were found closer to the south bank, indicating
   a tendency for separation of nesting areas. Discriminant function
   analysis indicated that water depth and presence of grass were
   correlated with the occurrence of hatchling groups. Melanosuchus niger
   hatchling groups occurred in areas with deeper water and more grass than
   those of C. crocodilus.
   This study showed that surveying hatchling groups in the Anavilhanas
   Archipelago is more efficient than surveying for subadults and adults,
   which, by itself, can give false impressions about the suitability of
   areas for conservation of breeding populations of these species.}},

Abstract = {{The movements of nine harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena (L.), in the
   Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine were tracked using satellite telemetry.
   Transmitters were attached to the porpoises in August 1994 and 1995
   after they were captured near Grand Manan Island at the mouth of the Bay
   of Fundy. Tracking periods ranged from 2 to 212 d (mean 50 +/- 65 d).
   Porpoises exhibited a high degree of individual variation in movement
   patterns; five moved out of the Bay of Fundy into the Gulf of Maine. The
   porpoise with the longest tracking period moved extensively throughout
   the Gulf of Maine. These data suggest that seasonal movement patterns of
   individual harbour porpoises are discrete and are not temporally
   coordinated migrations. Porpoises that moved out of the Bay of Fundy
   into the Gulf of Maine did so following the 92 m isobath, which may
   represent an important movement corridor. The movement of porpoises from
   the Bay of Fundy into the Gulf of Maine supports the hypothesis that
   harbour porpoises from these two regions comprise a single population at
   risk of entanglement in both Canadian and US fisheries.}},

Abstract = {{The growth and yield of three crops of cucumber and rhizosphere
   populations of soil nematodes were monitored in an experiment conducted
   on sandy loam soil which was (a) mulched with 0.4-mm-thick, clear or
   black plastic for five or nine weeks, (b) mulched then fertilized with 1
   kg N:P:K (4:16:4)/plot, (c) not mulched and treated with 45 g Banrot
   40WP/plot or 10 or 20 g Furadan 10G/plot at planting, (d) not mulched,
   but fertilized, (e) not mulched and not fertilized. In a second
   experiment, plots were mulched for four, six and eight weeks with clear
   or black plastic or not mulched. Ambient and soil temperatures were
   monitored during the mulching periods. Cucumber seedlings in the
   fertilized or nonfertilized plots which were mulched with either color
   of plastic often grew faster than those in the nonmulched plots. Plants
   from plots treated with fungicide or nematicide either had shoots which
   were shorter or of the same lengths as those from the nontreated plots.
   Plants from nonfertilized plots mulched for four or more weeks with
   clear plastic yielded more than the controls in Experiment 2; whereas,
   with black plastic, only plots mulched for six or eight weeks yielded
   more than the controls. Population densities of fungi in soil mulched
   with clear plastic were lower than those in nontreated soil, but those
   of bacteria were similar. Phytoparasitic and nonparasitic nematode
   population densities were reduced by the nematicide and by mulching with
   either color of plastic, but sometimes rose to the initial levels by the
   time of harvest. Plastic mulching significantly controlled weed growth
   but many of the monocotyledonous plants in the field grew in soil under
   the clear plastic.}},

Abstract = {{Harmful algal bloom (HAB) research and monitoring has traditionally been
   based on ecological and microbiological measurements which are
   laborious, time-consuming, and reliant on experienced operators. Recent
   developments in oligonucleotide probe technology and immunofluorescence
   research have revealed several potential applications and techniques
   that may be transposable to laboratory and field-based monitoring and
   research. Field trials are currently underway for fluorescent in situ
   hybridisation and sandwich hybridisation assays. The former is
   particularly suited for laboratory-based research on harmful algal bloom
   (HAB) population dynamics and structure, whereas the sandwich
   hybridisation assays based on a portable robotics workstation, offers
   the potential of quick and reliable laboratory and possibly field-based
   screening for HAB species. Initial development is underway for molecular
   beacons and the Q beta replicase detection system, both offer the
   potential of simple and cost effective strategies for field-based
   monitoring by people with minimal knowledge of molecular biology.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of the medionigra polymorphism in the moth, Panaxia dominula,
   at Cothill, Oxfordshire, UK, provides one of the longest and most
   complete data series in ecological genetics, and has provided a
   cornerstone in the development of this discipline. Changes in frequency
   between generations were used as proof of the overriding importance of
   selection in the prolonged and often heated selection/drift debate
   between R. A. Fisher, E. B. Ford and Sewall Wright. Recently evidence
   has emerged which suggests that the study may be flawed, particularly
   since phenotype appears to be influenced by environment. We offer what
   we regard as a proof of the inadequacy of this polymorphism for
   demonstrating selection, since phenotype is largely determined by
   temperature during the late larval or pupal phase. Hence workers st
   Cothill mere not recording genetic processes. Assumptions that the
   medionigra form occurred only at Cothill, and that gene flow never
   occurred between Cothill and neighbouring populations, also appear to be
   untrue. The long-term study at Cothill may remain as a landmark in the
   history of ecological genetics only by virtue of the cautionary lessons
   it may teach future workers in this field.}},

Abstract = {{A field-collected population of the silver leaf whitefly, Bemisia
   argenti-folii, was selected with the nicotinyl compound, imidacloprid,
   over 32 generations to determine if resistance would develop when
   maintained under continuous selection pressure in a greenhouse.
   Resistance was slow to increase at first with low to moderate levels of
   resistance (RR from 6- to 17-fold) in the first 15 generations of
   selection. Further selection steadily led to higher levels of
   resistance, with the greatest resistance ratio at 82-fold, the gradual
   rise suggesting the involvement of a polygenic system. At the end of the
   selection, slopes of probit regressions were substantially steeper than
   earlier, indicating increased homogeneity of imidacloprid resistance in
   this strain.
   A hydroponic bioassay featuring systemic uptake of imidacloprid through
   roots was developed to monitor the changes in resistance to imidacloprid
   in the selected whitefly strain and in seven field-collected strains
   from Imperial Valley, California. Six out of seven field-collected
   strains exhibited low LC50 values (0.002 to 0.512 mg ml(-1)) compared to
   the selected resistant strain, with one exception where the LC50 was
   0.926 mg ml(-1) (RR=15.0). Variation in responses to imidacloprid in the
   field strains suggest that this technique is sufficiently sensitive to
   detect differences in susceptibilities of whitefly populations. The
   imidacloprid-resistant strain showed no cross-resistance to endosulfan,
   chlorpyrifos or methomyl (RR ranging from 0.4- to 15-fold). A low level
   of cross-resistance was observed to bifenthrin in the IM-R strain at
   7-fold. The success of selection for resistance to imidacloprid has
   serious implications for whitefly control programs that rely heavily on
   imidacloprid.}},

Abstract = {{This review attempts to integrate pollution research with behavioural
   ecology by focusing on reproductive behaviour of fishes. A search of
   Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts and other sources showed that
   only 0.1\% of 19,199 studies of aquatic pollution and fishes during the
   past 20 years have made this link. Effects on parental care and
   courtship have been investigated using a variety of pollutants (e.g.
   acidification, herbicide, thermal effluent) in several fish families
   (e.g. Cichlidae, Poeciliidae, Gasterosteidae, Cyprinidae).
   Eleven of the 19 studies found a change in behaviour from the norm.
   Effects on courtship included decreases or increases in frequency of
   displays, increased courtship duration, or performance of male-like
   behaviour by masculinized females. Studies of parental care have found
   decreased nest-building activity, decreased offspring defence, or
   changes in division of parental care between the sexes. Few studies have
   measured reproductive success or extrapolated their results to effects
   on populations.
   We develop a framework for exploring links between pollution and
   behavioural ecology which suggests potential impacts on life history
   trade-offs in reproduction, genetic changes in populations, and
   population sizes. Many reproductive behaviours of fish species are
   readily quantifiable and behaviours such as courtship by male guppies
   and other members of the Poeciliidae show some promise for pollution
   monitoring and behavioural toxicity tests. Choice of such assays would
   have to compete with the sensitivity and practicality of more
   traditional methods but may serve as useful complements. There is
   considerable scope for further research into conservation. A synthesis
   between behavioural ecology and toxicology should thus provide useful
   insights for both fields.}},

Abstract = {{Population estimates of selected arthropods including lepidopterous
   larvae, spiders, and adult and immature hemipterous and chewing
   predators in early season cotton, by sweep net, drop cloth, and a
   tractor-mounted sampler were compared. Population estimates by the
   tractor-mounted sampler were usually highly correlated to those provided
   by one or both of the other methods except for arthropods observed only
   at very low population levels. The tractor-mounted sampler most
   frequently detected presence of most arthropods at low population
   levels, and generally provided lower estimates of relative sample
   variation than sweep net or drop cloth methods. The need for
   modifications to the tractor-mounted sampler to improve the efficiency
   of collection of hemipterous nymphs is suggested. Our results indicate
   the tractor-mounted sampler provides an adequate means of sampling
   arthropods in early season cotton and may be particularly useful in
   monitoring arthropods occurring at low population levels.}},

   specific, management-oriented questions. Recovery of rare plants through
   reintroduction or enhancement of populations is an experiment, supported
   by ex situ conservation techniques and informed by the results of
   modeling the dynamics of surrogate populations. There is a larger role
   for botanical gardens and arboreta to play in conservation. That larger
   role must extend into the realm of offsite projects, resource
   management, and other applied aspects of plant conservation. By
   combining ex situ and in situ approaches, botanic gardens will thus
   develop expertise in managing wild-lands as potential habitat for rare
   and endangered species. However, creating and managing plant populations
   in the wild is but one facet of restoration ecology, a fledgling science
   in need of an institutional home that promotes a full exchange between
   theory and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Flow cytometry (FC) has been used extensively for monitoring human blood
   cell populations and it would be useful if this technology could be
   applied to the analysis of prawn haemocytes. This paper shows that the
   Cell-Dyn 3000 flow cytometer can distinguish haemocyte types from
   Penaeus monodon and then describes the range of haemocyte counts within
   normal prawns. The total haemocyte count was 23.3 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)
   using a haemocytometer and 21.0 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) with the FC. With
   light microscopy, nongranular, small-granular and large-granular
   haemocytes were 82.7 +/- 14, 15.6 +/- 17, and 1.7 +/- 2\% respectively
   of the cell types, whilst with FC, the proportions were 82.6 +/- 17,
   14.5 +/- 15, and 2.9 +/- 3 \% respectively. Neither age, weight,
   carapace length nor population source had any significant effect (p >
   0.05) on total or differential haemocyte counts. However, sex had a
   significant effect (p < 0.05) and once sexual dimorphism, as measured by
   total length, had occurred in the prawn population, females showed
   increased nongranular haemocyte counts (F = 4.56, df = 1,39, p < 0.05)
   and, consequently, total haemocyte counts (F = 4.60, df = 1,39, p <
   0.05). The third sequential bleeding of prawns (0.1 ml of haemolymph
   bleed(-1)) produced a significant decrease in total haemocyte numbers
   with proportional increases in granular haemocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy cattle and swine manure mixed with barley straw was composted in
   four successive series in a continuously working horizontal drum
   composting system. Changes in microbiological and chemical parameters
   were monitored during the active composting process in the drum and
   during three months curing in indoor heaps. Hygienization, as determined
   by disappearance of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, was obtained
   within seven days of composting in the drum. During the active
   composting, the populations of heterotrophic mesophilic bacteria,
   enumerated by the dilution plate method, decreased compared with the
   populations in feeding material, and the densities increased during
   early curing, being highest after two months of curing. Thermophilic
   heterotrophic bacteria were most abundant in the early stages of curing.
   The ratio thermophilic/mesophilic heterotrophic populations was highest
   inside the drum during the early thermophilic phase of composting.
   Microbial activity, measured as dehydrogenase activity, was typically
   high in the feeding material, and decreased slowly during the active
   stage of composting in the drum and the early stages of curing in heaps.
   In all experimental series, dehydrogenase activities decreased in mature
   composts to the final constant level of 4.44-5.43 mu M TPF g(-1) (dw) 3
   h(-1). Water-soluble mineral N decreased during drum composting and was
   at its minimum after one to two months curing. In the outfeeds hardly
   any NO3-N was observed, but during curing, the NH4-N/NO3N ratio
   decreased to less than one. Water-soluble P was at its minimum in
   outfeeds and increased during curing. During composting, the C/N ratio
   decreased from 22.6-28.5 to 12.7-13.6. The ratio C/N-final to
   C/N-initial decreased to 0.65-0.75 and to 0.49-0.59 after one and two
   months of curing, respectively. Approximately 11-27\% of the total C was
   lost during seven days active composting and 62-66\% during the whole
   composting time; the respective gaseous losses of N were 13-23\% and
   23-37\% of the total N. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of land use, and landscape
   composition and structure on the population dynamics of fossorial water
   vole (Arvicola terrestris scherman Shaw). Water vole populations were
   monitored from 1989 to 1994 in the Doubs department, France, by using
   index methods. Land use patterns were studied based on agriculture and
   forestry data from the French Ministry of Agriculture collected in 1956,
   1970, 1979 and 1988. Grassland quality and landscape structure were
   studied based on field transects, combined with the assessment of
   landscape structure from maps at 1:25,000 scale. Outbreaks of water vole
   populations occurred as a wave, spreading from epicentres over more than
   2500 km(2). The propagation speed was in excess of 10 km/yr. On a
   regional level (n x 10 km) and over 5 years and more, density variation
   patterns of water vole were linked to the ratio of ploughed land and of
   permanent grassland to farmland. At a sectional scale (n x 1 km),
   forests and uncultivated lands had a dampening effect both on the
   outbreaks and on their duration. The evolution of farmlands from 1956 to
   1988 was apparently the major cause of increase in density variations of
   water vole. Therefore, land use and landscape management could be a way
   to control water vole outbreaks, and their effects are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{We monitored water sodium concentration ({[}Na]), water volume. and
   larval densities of insects in natural treeholes and larval insects in
   simulated treeholes. In natural treeholes, water {[}Na] was inversely
   correlated with mosquito and helodid beetle densities; water {[}Na] was
   positively correlated with water volume in 1996. The culicid Aedes
   triseriatus (Say), the ceratopogonid Culicoides guttipennis
   (Coquillett), and the syrphid Mallota posticata (F.) were the Ist to
   colonize simulated treeholes. Denstities of the helodid beetle, Helodes
   pulchella (Guerin), and Prionocyphon discoideus (Say), were
   significantly higher and mosquito populations had a significantly higher
   proportion of early instars in microcosms that were lower in {[}Na] and
   {[}Mg]. On the other hand, more early instars of midges were found in
   microcosms higher in {[}Na] and {[}Mg]. The consistency of the
   relationship between low {[}Na] and high insect density in natural
   treeholes, and the effects of {[}Na] on microcosm communities, suggest
   that {[}Na] and perhaps other cations may be important resources and
   cues to treehole organisms and may partially determine treehole
   community structure.}},

Abstract = {{In a naturally infested colony a strong con-elation between levels of
   falling mites and the emergence of honeybee brood was found. When
   comparing the number of mires falling between emerging worker and drone
   brood with known infestation levels, the mite fall was 2-3 times higher
   from worker than from drone cells. It was estimated that around half of
   the falling mites originate from mites that died within the sealed cell
   with the other half dying shortly after bee emergence. About 50\% of the
   fallen mites were still alive and found to be able to reproduce when
   artificially introduced into sealed brood cells. The implications of
   mite mortality associated with brood emergence on the mite population
   dynamics and of using numbers of falling mites as a monitoring tool are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the growth characteristics and competitive abilities of
   Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus cereus in soil. The growth and
   persistence of the two bacilli, added to sterile soil with or without
   soil bacteria, were monitored under aerobic conditions. When vegetative
   cells or spores of B. thuringiensis and/or B. cereus were added to
   sterile soil, both bacilli increased their numbers. The final levels of
   population were greater for B. cereus than for B. thuringiensis. In most
   of the cases when vegetative cells of B. thuringiensis were added at the
   same time as indigenous soil bacteria to sterile soil, B. thuringiensis
   sporulated immediately without any growth. B. thuringiensis grew only
   when both B. thuringiensis and indigenous soil bacteria were inoculated
   at low densities. On the other hand, when vegetative cells or spores of
   B. cereus were added at the same time as indigenous soil bacteria to
   sterile soil, B. cereus grew even when indigenous soil bacteria were
   inoculated at high density. These data suggest that B. thuringiensis is
   less adaptive to soil habitats than B. cereus.}},

Abstract = {{Due to natural and anthropogenic changes, Bracas lagoon (Figueira da Foz
   - Portugal) dried during the summers of 1989 and 1991-1993. In order to
   enhance the water level (by increasing depth) and water quality (by
   reducing internal nutrient loading), the sediment of this lagoon was
   partially removed in 1993 (August to October). Afterwards, this lagoon
   was monitored during 13 months for water temperature, conductivity,
   oxygen, pH, nitrates, nitrites, ammonium, phosphorus, depth and
   transparency, phytoplankton (chlorophyll-a) and zooplankton, in two
   zones: the dredged (DZ) and the non-dredged (NDZ). Sediment removal
   induced resuspension of fine particles, giving rise to a decrease in
   transparency and an increase in the amount of inorganic nutrients.
   Thereafter, DZ showed lower nutrient concentrations than NDZ, mainly
   regarding to phosphorus and nitrogen. Chlorophyll-a concentration was
   significantly lower in DZ (annual mean = 0.33 mg/m(3)) than in NDZ
   (annual mean = 2.31 mg/m(3)). In November (1993), zooplankton
   populations (rotifers, copepods and cladocerans) were already inhabiting
   the DZ. Ceriodaphnia pulchella SARS collected in previous studies was
   not recorded; otherwise, additional species were recorded (Ceriodaphnia
   reticulata JURINE, Simocephalus vetulus O. F. MULLER and Moina
   rectirostris LEYDIG). Macrophyte vegetation did not develop in the DZ
   during the studied period.}},

Abstract = {{Maps of estimated annual mean background surface concentrations of NOx
   and NO2 in the U.K. have been calculated on 1 km x 1 km grid for 1994.
   These maps have been calculated using a multistage approach which
   includes the interpolation of rural measurements and the empirical
   modelling of the local source contribution to ambient concentrations.
   The empirical regression models were calibrated with reference to
   automatic monitoring data and then validated by comparison with
   diffusion tube measurements of NO2 at several hundred sites. Estimates
   of the population potentially exposed to annual mean concentrations of
   pollutants above certain thresholds were calculated from these maps.
   These threshold annual mean concentrations can be approximately equated
   with proposed and existing air quality standards for NO2, benzene and
   1,3 butadiene. These estimates indicate that about 8\% of the population
   live in regions where the annual mean NO2 concentration is above the
   European Union Directive Guide Value for a median concentration of 26
   ppb; about 23\% live in areas at risk of exceeding the U.K. Government
   proposed 99.9th percentile target for NO2 of 104.6 ppb and about 30\%
   live in areas with running annual mean benzene concentrations exceeding
   1 ppb. (C) 1997 AEA Technology pie. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{When the Maputaland Marine Reserve was proclaimed in 1986, conservation
   authorities held divergent opinions on whether traditional subsistence
   harvesting of the intertidal resources should be allowed to continue. A
   monitoring programme was therefore instituted, with the assistance of
   the local community, to quantify the intertidal harvest as a first step
   to assessing its sustainability. Catch and effort data for ghost crabs
   Ocypode spp. and mole crabs Emerita austroafricana and Hippa ovalis over
   a 7-year period are discussed here. Total (day and night) harvests
   declined from 146000 ghost crabs and 129000 mole crabs in 1989 to 86000
   ghost crabs and 80000 mole crabs in 1993. However, effort also declined
   and the mean annual catch per unit effort for night catches, which
   comprised 89\% of the total catch, changed little, averaging 28.3 ghost
   crabs and 24.5 mole crabs per harvester per night. About 8\% of the
   ghost crab harvest is sold, generating an annual income of R1700. There
   ape no indications that harvesting of ghost crabs and mole crabs is
   unsustainable, and harvesting effort appears to be decreasing. No change
   in management is recommended. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The shellfish harvest from c. 36600 woman collecting days in the
   Maputaland Marine Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa was monitored
   between 1988 and 1994. Mussels Perna perna (185 t), oysters Striostrea
   margaritacea and Saccostrea cucullata (5 t), red bait Pyura stolonifera
   (41 t flesh weight) and limpets Patella and Fissurella spp. (144000
   animals) were the main species harvested although a wide range of
   organisms was collected opportunistically, Catch and effort were greater
   in winter than in summer. Very little of the catch was sold. There was a
   marked spatial separation of the major organisms harvested, which has
   persisted for generations. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of mussels, red
   bait and oysters remained stable over the 7-year period, bur CPUE of
   limpets declined. Harvesting effort decreased by >50\% between 1988 and
   1994 because of the gradual development of a cash economy and the return
   of refugees to Mozambique. Mussel harvests were very much greater than
   in Transkei, but there appears to be no decline in mussel abundance.
   Catches Mere limited by effort rather than supply. Collecting
   techniques, distribution patterns of the organisms, and the presence of
   large unharvested adjacent populations may account for stable catches.

Abstract = {{Long-term mark-recapture data were used to estimate the annual survival
   rates of Redshank wintering on the Moray Firth in Scotland. Survival
   modelling required the exclusion of all birds caught during the main
   passage months (August, March and April), and a highly variable annual
   catching effort limited the precision of annual survival estimates.
   Survival rates of juvenile Redshank (between the first and second
   winters of life) varied markedly from year to year and averaged 43\% (se
   3.6\%). Adult survival rates were less variable between years and were
   age-dependent, with 67\% (se 5.0\%) surviving and returning between the
   second and third winters of life, compared to 74\% (se 1.4\%) for older
   birds. Year-to-year variation in adult survival was weakly (and
   negatively) related to the number of snow days in winter Year-to-year
   variation in first-year survival was non-linearly related to winter
   rainfall, with low survival during dry (and cold) winters, higher
   survival during winters with average rainfall and lower survival during
   wet winters. Having accounted for these weather relationships there was
   no evidence that survival was related to the size of the local wintering
   Redshank population. Organized annual ringing programmes of wintering
   waders on British estuaries have the potential to monitor long-term
   changes in survival rates and productivity. Although constant effort
   sampling may be difficult to achieve for wintering waders, the utility
   of mark-recapture data collected on estuaries is likely to depend
   heavily on careful study design.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of breeding Greenshank Tringa nebularia was undertaken in 1995,
   based on a stratified sample of 5-km squares selected at random from the
   UK breeding range. Approximately 8\% of the breeding range was surveyed.
   Surveyors visited 101 survey squares twice in the breeding season,
   covering suitable dry areas to within 500 nr, and all tact areas. Any
   Greenshank recorded were mapped. Breeding densities varied from zero to
   art estimated 1.4 `territories' per km(2). The survey produced
   population estimates of 1440 summering `pairs' (95\% confidence limits:
   1100-1790), based on half the peak count of adults, and 870 pairs with
   young (95\% confidence limits: 570-1200). The distribution of sightings
   within survey squares was used to derive a possible mean territory
   radius of 800 in. Interpreting survey maps using this figure, art
   estimate of 1080 occupied breeding `territories' was produced (95\%
   confidence limits: 720-1480). Information is also presented on the
   altitudes of Greenshank sightings, variations in Greenshank
   `detectability' through the survey period and regional variation in
   Greenshank abundance. The survey In?ls down a baseline for long-term
   population monitoring of Greenshank by a repeatable method.}},

   Similar chemical analyses of sex pheromone gland extracts indicated the

   exhibited no significant synergistic or inhibitory effects. PVC rods
   with an 85:15 E:Z-11-14:Ald blend is recommended as a trap bait for
   monitoring population trends, It is unknown whether or not the

   the more common aphid species during ``heading out.{''} Winter wheat
   cultivars differed in their resistance to R. padi development; the
   highest reproductive rate was on `Absolvent.' The effect of chemicals
   used in intensive cereal management on R. padi and Coccinella
   septempunctata (L.) was assessed. Dimethoate and carbaryl caused similar
   high mortality to both insects, but pirimicarb was more toxic to the
   aphid than to its predator. Over a 2-year period, field plots that
   received regular pirimicarb treatments for selective aphid control early
   in the growing season showed a 9\% increase in wheat yield, compared
   with the checks and plots that received carbaryl, Wheat yield increased
   18\% when pirimicarb was used later in the season; when applied in both
   periods, pirimicarb gave a total yield increase of nearly 30\%. Late
   applications of carbaryl alone, or in combination with pirimicarb,
   increased yields by only 9\% over the controls. Half of the yield
   increase (18\% vs. 9\%) with late season control by pirimicarb was lost
   with the addition of carbaryl, which minimized the C. septempunctata
   population for nonselective insect control. Rhopalosiphum padi numbers
   from June 20 to July 15 had the greatest impact on yield in these plots,
   and natural control agents including C. septempunctata accounted for a
   9\% increase in yield.}},

Abstract = {{Productivity of Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) was studied in
   north-central Washington during 1992-1996. Nest timing and success,
   clutch size, probability of nesting and renesting, and variation
   associated with age and year were examined for 84 females monitored with
   the aid of radio telemetry. Although date of nest initiation varied
   annually, yearling females (hatched in previous year) consistently
   nested later than adults; mean date of initiation of incubation was 22
   April overall. The average nest contained 9.1 eggs and was incubated for
   27 days. Clutch size was smaller for renests than for first nests;
   clutch size also varied annually. Although the overall rate of nest
   success was only 36.7\%, all females apparently nested at least once,
   and at least 87.0\% of females renested following predation of their
   first nests. As a result of renesting, annual breeding success was
   estimated as 61.3\%. Percent of all females that produced a brood at
   least 50 days old was 49.5\%; at least 33.4\% of 515 chicks survived
   greater than or equal to 50 days following hatch. Although the rates of
   nesting and renesting appear to have been under-estimated in other
   studied populations, Sage Grouse in north-central Washington display
   more reproductive effort overall; they lay more eggs and are more likely
   to nest and renest.}},

Abstract = {{Nodularin together with cell numbers of Nodularia spumigena were
   monitored during a toxic bloom of this cyanobacterium during the
   summer/autumn of 1994-1995 in Lakes Alexandrina and Albert, South
   Australia. There was a good correlation between cell numbers and toxin
   concentration over the course of the bloom at a number of locations. The
   correlation was poorer toward the end of the bloom, and may have
   reflected cell lysis and release of toxin to the surrounding water where
   it was rapidly degraded. The results suggested that the suitability of
   the lake water for drinking could be better determined by monitoring
   toxin content rather than cell numbers.
   Degradation of nodularin was studied and found to be more rapid in lake
   water that was supporting a bloom compared with water collected that had
   not experienced a bloom for several months. Half-lives were 24 and 54 h,
   respectively. There was no lag phase in water that was supporting a
   bloom, suggesting a relatively high population of microorganisms capable
   of degrading the toxin to be present. Toxin released to the lake water
   from lysing cells would therefore disappear very quickly.
   Toxin degradation was inhibited in the presence of copper ions. Copper
   sulphate treatment of blooms may therefore be doubly disadvantageous.
   Not only are cells lysed by copper sulphate addition, thereby releasing
   toxin to the surrounding water, but the natural microbial population
   capable of degrading the toxin may be destroyed, or the enzymes capable
   of toxin degradation inhibited. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Ecotoxicological management and research have several instruments at
   their disposal. A discriminatory is made between monitoring of chemical,
   biochemical, toxicological and ecological parameters, and modeling at a
   simple, intermediate, and complex level. Their usefulness is discussed
   and illustrated by examples from the Rhine-Meuse delta.
   Each type of instrument has its own benefits. In simple cases,
   application of one instrument will do. More often, however, the
   objectives set, the compounds concerned, and the species involved
   require a combination of tools to be used. Chemical and biochemical
   parameters are oriented around sources and concentrations of well-known
   priority substances. Toxicological and ecological variables, on the
   other hand, are directed toward species and the impact of these
   compounds and other factors as well. In the Rhine-Meuse delta,
   contamination decreases and more refined instruments are needed to pick
   out the compounds and species that should get our attention most. An
   intermediate level of modeling is considered the next logical step after
   application of simple rules of thumb, (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Data are presented on prey choice, nest architecture, natural enemies,
   daily activity patterns, and seasonal patterns of nest occupancy in a
   population of Cerceris rufopicta Smith in northeastern Kansas. Most
   behaviors observed in this population are quite similar to those
   reported from populations in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and
   New York. As in the eastern populations, by far the most common prey are
   two species of beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae (Chrysomelidae), but
   late in the season at least one wasp began provisioning primarily with
   Eugnamptus angustatus. (Herbst), a weevil in the family Rhynchitidae,
   not previously recorded as prey of C. rufopicta. Nest architecture and
   natural enemies are very similar to what has been reported for the
   eastern populations, but provisioning activity in the Kansas population
   occupies a much greater part of the day, with some wasps continuing to
   provision even after sunset. This difference is not because individual
   wasps in Kansas are active for a longer period of time, but because the
   activity schedules of different individuals within the Kansas
   aggregation are not closely synchronized. Approximately half of the
   nests that were monitored over a period of three and a half weeks were
   occupied by a single wasp. Other nests changed ownership during the
   course of the study, either because the original owner disappeared and
   another wasp moved in, or because one wasp drove another away from a
   nest. During the time that ownership of a nest was being contested it
   might be simultaneously used by more than one wasp, but no evidence of
   cooperative joint nesting was seen in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Since the early nineteen-seventies, the parasitic protozoans Marteilia
   refringens and Bonamia ostreae have consistently deleteriously affected
   the French production of Ostrea edulis (Linne). Purification and
   inoculation of B. ostreae that were achieved in the late
   nineteen-eighties allowed a selection program to be initiated. Two O.
   edulis strains, S85 and S89, were raised that displayed significant
   resistance to B. ostreae in the held. Growth was monitored to ensure
   that the resistant strains grew at a rate comparable to that of
   controls, using two crosses between the first generation of S89 and the
   second generation of S85 (G1G2), and between the first generation of S89
   and wild oysters (G0G1). Growth and mortality were monitored for seven
   consecutive months in an intensive open circulating system at the
   IFREMER station of Bouin (Vendee, France). A Chapman-Richards model of
   growth revealed that the two ``resistant{''} crosses grew significantly
   better than two controls from Quiberon Bay (Brittany), an area in which
   B. ostreae is endemic, and Palavas (Mediterranean Sea), where oysters
   are less infested by this parasite. The asymptotic values for growth
   curves ranged between 27.2 and 28.2 g for G1G2 and G0G1 vs 21.0 and 22.8
   g for the controls. There was a similar trend in mortality, with G1G2
   (11.8\%) surviving better than the three other populations (from 28.7 to
   57.5\%). B. ostreae was not detected during the experiments and
   mortalities were attributed to feeding conditions that were not optimal,
   reinforced by gametogenesis and high temperatures during the summer. It
   is suggested that the better performance of G1G2 and G0G1 resulted from
   their increased resistance to stress.}},

Abstract = {{Due to a pipeline rupture on May 15th 1994, 2700 m(3) of a crude oil
   reached the sea, affecting rocky shore communities, which have been
   monitored since 1993, These biological data, analysed by BACl approach,
   were integrated to chemical and toxicological analysis of the oil.
   Results of Student's t-test did not indicate a significant difference
   between the percent cover average of the monitored populations (mussels
   and barnacles) from samples taken before and after the oil spill, The
   acute and chronic toxicity tests showed high toxicity of the oil. The
   lack of stress (i.e. mortality) on the populations can be mainly
   associated to: the sampling area was not highly contaminated despite the
   great amount of oil which reached surrounding areas; there were not
   enough physical (smothering) or chemical (toxicity) effects of the oil
   to alter the density of the populations which are considered moderately
   resistant to oil, (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Practical methods for biomonitoring of natural systems are still under
   development. Bacteria are potentially useful indicators of water quality
   because of their species diversity and ability to rapidly respond to
   changing environmental conditions. In this study, bacterial populations
   from unpolluted and polluted stream sites in two watersheds were
   compared to determine their suitability for use as environmental
   indicators. Upper Three Runs Creek and Four Mile Creek headwaters have
   had little anthropogenic disturbance, as opposed to lower Four Mile
   Creek which received thermal, radioactive, and chemical perturbations.
   Chemical and physical measurements provided evidence that seepage from
   holding ponds polluted Four Mile Creek Polluted sites did not have
   altered total bacterial numbers but had decreased numbers of
   colony-forming units. Abundances of three bacterial species,
   Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Burkholderia cepacia, and Pseudomonas
   putida, were determined by colony hybridization with species-specific
   rDNA probes. Contribution of A. calcoaceticus to the assemblage was
   higher at polluted sites, which indicated either tolerance of polluted
   conditions or the ability to utilize compounds existing at these sites
   to reach larger populations. No differences in B. cepacia populations
   were detected, and differences in P. putida populations could not be
   attributed solely to disturbance. The pollution of Four Mile Creek
   induced differences in bacterial populations that could be monitored
   using the described approach.}},

Abstract = {{CTC (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride) is a redox indicator that
   facilitates the detection of microbial electron transport activity due
   to the fluorescence and water insolubility of the reduced CTC-formazan
   (CTF). The goal of this work was to establish the relationship between
   the CTC response (both the numbers of CTF-containing cells and the
   fluorescence intensity of CTF per cell) and respiration in mixed
   microbial communities. To obtain CTF-containing cell numbers over a
   range of respiration rates, aerobic bioreactors with on-line CO2
   monitoring were batch fed ground wheal at slow, intermediate, and fast
   retention limes. Samples were taken before and after feeding, and
   throughout starvation cycles. Each sample was treated with 25 mM CTC,
   and either supplemented with 10\% R2A, or left unsupplemented.
   CTF-containing cell numbers showed a weak and inconsistent response to
   transient pulses in respiration, and decreased during long-term
   starvation at all three retention times. The degree of starvation within
   the microbial community could be estimated using the ratio of
   supplemented to unsupplemented CTF-containing cell population. Total
   fluorescence intensity per cell was consistently higher at peaks of CO2
   production, but did not decrease as dramatically as total cell numbers
   did in response to starvation. The results indicate the importance of
   concurrent examination of both the numbers and total fluorescence
   intensity of CTF-containing cells.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of bull trout in the Clark Fork River drainage of western
   Montana are small and fragmented by hydroelectric dams. The movements of
   four adult bull trout in this river were monitored by radiotelemetry
   after transport upstream of Milltown Dam. Two fish migrated 40 and 130
   km to tributary streams of Rock Creek; one of these likely spawned. Two
   other bull trout moved downstream of the dam and appeared to later
   attempt to re-ascend. Movements of these bull trout suggest that
   Milltown Dam blacks migrations and that transporting fish upstream of
   the dam can enhance populations. Given the small sizes of bull trout
   populations in the Clark Fork River drainage, the benefits derived from
   transporting adult fish over dams is potentially great.}},

Abstract = {{The peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) can resist a range of
   insecticides by over-producing detoxifying esterase and having
   mutant-insensitive forms of the target proteins, acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE), and the sodium channel. Using a combination of bioassays,
   biochemical and DNA diagnostics, it is now possible to diagnose all
   three mechanisms in individual aphids, and thereby establish their
   spatial distributions and temporal dynamics. A survey of 58 samples of
   wide geographic origin showed that all 46 resistant clones had amplified
   esterase genes (E4 or FE4) conferring broad-spectrum resistance to
   pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates. These occurred in
   combination with insensitive AChE (11 clones), conferring resistance to
   pirimicarb and triazamate, and/or mutant sodium channel genes (25
   clones), conferring knockdown (kdr) resistance to pyrethroids and DDT.
   Amplified esterase genes were in linkage disequilibrium with both
   insensitive AChE and the kdr mutation, reflecting tight physical
   linkage, heavy selection favouring aphids with multiple mechanisms,
   and/or the prominence of parthenogenesis in many M. persicae
   populations. An ability to monitor individual mechanisms with
   contrasting cross-resistance profiles has important implications for the
   development of resistance management recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{Two sprays of fenpropimorph per season were applied to a winter wheat
   field trial, at a range of rates, which included the full commercial
   rate, in order to test the effect of fenpropimorph sprays on the
   sensitivity of Erysiphe graminis f.sp. tritici. While a reduction in the
   sensitivity of the mildew isolates was detected after fungicide
   application, this was not dependent on the rate of fungicide applied.
   Reduced rates were not found to induce a larger shift towards
   insensitivity than the full commercial rate. Powdery mildew isolates
   were collected from 1993 to 1996 and their sensitivity to fenpropimorph
   determined in order to monitor sensitivity changes in the population.
   While a decline in sensitivity was noted from season to season, there
   was no correlation between a lower sensitivity and the rate of
   fenpropimorph previously used. Isolates collected in Scotland were found
   to be significantly less sensitive than those sampled in the south of
   England.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of three types of habitat improvement structures were
   evaluated in Joe Farrell's Brook, a small second order salmonid stream
   in Newfoundland, Canada which had been adversly affected by forest
   harvesting activities. Fish populations and key habitat attributes were
   monitored prior to and, in two subsequent years after, boulder clusters,
   V-dams and half-log covers were placed at selected sites in channellised
   reaches. Boulder clusters proved to be the most effective structure,
   increasing densities of 0+, 1+, and 3+ juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo
   salar L.) after placement of instream devices. V-dams proved to be
   effective in increasing both the density of brook trout (Salvelinus
   fontinalis Mitchel) and Atlantic salmon through the creation of more
   diverse pool habitat. Half-log covers increased the number of juvenile
   salmon age 0+ through an increase in instream cover. These increases in
   salmonid abundance, however, were considered not to be solely attributed
   to an improvement in physical habitat. Other factors may influence or
   modify productivity of the stream reaches treated. For example, relative
   abundance, size distribution, biomass, and production are controlled by
   physical and chemical habitat variables and are modified through inter-
   and intra-specific competition. The general conclusion was that the
   restoration techniques increased habitat heterogenity and the degree of
   habitat complexity in channellised sections; therefore, reducing
   competition and increasing production. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial shading studies indicated that competition for
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) will limit tuber production in
   purple nutsedge. There were no data available to test whether there is a
   relationship between incident PAR underneath crop canopies and tuber
   production of this weed. In this study, the effect of crop competition
   on net reproductive rates of purple nutsedge tubers was measured under
   field conditions. Purple nutsedge plants were grown in association with
   bush beans, maize, maize and beans intercropped, sweet potato, pole
   beans, and bell pepper in a 2-yr field study in Costa Rica. Measurements
   were taken on the number of tubers produced during the growing season of
   each crop, and PAR transmittance was monitored weekly for the duration
   of the respective cropping cycles. Data on transmittance and incident
   solar radiation were used to calculate the daily average amount of PAR,
   available 15 cm above the soil surface. Regressions indicated that
   average incident PAR accounted for 95\% of the variation in net
   reproductive rates. Average incident PAR also allowed a more precise
   competitive ranking of crops than either average or minimum
   transmittance. Bush beans had consistently the lowest average incident
   PAR values and therefore ranked as the most competitive crop in both
   years. Our data suggest that no net increase in tuber populations occurs
   if average incident PAR is below 2.7 MJ m(-2) d(-1). Differences in the
   duration of the cropping cycle accounted only for a small proportion of
   the overall variation in net reproductive rates of purple nutsedge
   tubers. Information on the competitive ranking of different crops can be
   used to design crop rotations that could reduce reliance on herbicides
   on small farms in Costa Rica.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, evidence from disparate observations has indicated
   adverse changes in the reproductive health and fecundity of animals and
   humans. In humans, there is strong evidence for such trends in the
   incidences of testicular and female breast cancer, and concern has also
   been expressed regarding semen quality, cryptorchidism, hypospadias and
   polycystic ovaries. Laboratory studies have indicated that some
   chemicals in the environment, both natural and synthetic, have the
   potential to disrupt the endocrine system and that these could, at least
   theoretically, be partly responsible for the observed changes. Chemicals
   thus identified include the naturally occurring steroid hormones,
   phyto-and myco-estrogens, and anthropogenic chemicals such as synthetic
   hormones, organotins, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated
   biphenyls, dioxins, alkylphenol polyethoxylates, phthalates and
   bisphenol-A. While there is no direct evidence from human studies to
   confirm a causal link between exposure and effect, concern exists and is
   strengthened by reports of adverse reproductive and developmental
   effects in wildlife, possibly mediated via endocrine disruptive
   pathways. The development of imposer in neogastropod molluscs exposed to
   tributyltin has been attributed to such a mechanism and in wild
   populations of fish, alligators and birds, instances of masculinisation
   or feminisation in polluted areas have been noted. Among mammals,
   disturbed fertility of Florida panthers and some marine species has also
   been reported. A concentrated research and monitoring programme is
   required to clarify the nature and extent of effects on reproductive
   health in humans and wildlife, and to assess human and wildlife exposure
   to relevant naturally occurring or anthropogenic endocrine disrupting
   substances. This will enable a more robust evaluation of the
   contribution that environmental chemical exposure may have on adverse
   trends in the reproductive health of humans and wildlife. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Extraordinary floral variation is common among some orchids that employ
   deception to attract pollinators. This variation may be maintained by
   frequency-dependent selection where rare phenotypes are preferred. Over
   a 2-yr period, 1993-1994, we monitored the reproductive success of
   Tolumnia variegata, an obligately outcrossing epiphytic orchid, at three
   localities in Puerto Rico that differed in pollinator service. Plants
   varied in floral morphology and fragrance characteristics. Artificial
   arrays of varying frequencies of scentless and fragrant phenotypes were
   established to test for frequency-dependent selection. Where pollinators
   were rare (Cambalache, range of census average = 0-0.2 bees/h),
   0.9-1.2\% of the flowers were effectively visited (pollinarium removals
   and pollinations). At Tortuguero where 0.4-1.1 bees/h were observed,
   4-9.2\% of the flowers were visited. At Pi (n) over tilde ones where
   bees were the most abundant (1.4-5.2 bees/h), 20.9-25.0\% of the flowers
   were visited. A significant portion of the variance in all measures of
   reproductive success (male, female, and combined) was explained by
   differences among populations, which we attribute mostly to variation in
   pollinator abundance. Neither the fragrance phenotype nor its frequency
   had a significant effect on success as revealed by a split-plot ANOVA.
   There was a significant interaction between population and phenotypic
   frequencies in all our measures of reproductive success, but only for
   the 1994 flowering season. Thus, variation in floral fragrance
   phenotypes is not likely maintained by frequency-dependent selection.
   High levels of variation remain unexplained.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the short-term effects of experimental flooding on a
   population of Peromyscus leucopus in a Rio Grande riparian forest that
   had not flooded for over 50 y. We monitored populations at two sites for
   2 yr before flooding and then for 3 yr during which we flooded one sice
   between mid-May and mid-June each year. Considerable interannual
   variation in density was detected at both sites, with no clear effect of
   flooding on density. Some mice stayed within the forest during flooding
   and used trees as refugia. Survivorship decreased slightly at the flood
   site after the first flood but did not differ from the reference site 2
   mo after flooding that year, nor in the final year. There was no
   difference between sites in recruitment of new individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Data on pairing behavior of nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus
   novemcinctus) were collected for 4 yr in a marked population in S Texas.
   A pair consisted of a male and female maintaining proximity (<10 m)
   without aggression, pairing behavior involved those behaviors exhibited
   during this interaction. Some of these behaviors were only observed
   during pairing. Males were responsible for maintaining proximity to
   females through repeated approaches and by monitoring their surroundings
   for the location or movement of the female (i.e., exhibiting vigilance).
   The incidences of some behaviors were significantly associated with
   others, specifically dorsal touches by males elicited tail-wagging by
   females. Tail-wagging probably facilitated the transmission of olfactory
   information about female receptivity. After tail-wagging the male was
   more likely to contact and sniff. Contacts, which occurred in every
   pairing event were positively correlated with sniffs and tail-wagging
   and might be used as an index of receptivity. Pairing behavior
   apparently generated a cost of reduced foraging time for males by
   increasing their vigilance levels.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of long-term monitoring data on breeding collared flycatchers
   (Ficedula albicollis Temm.) has revealed equal numbers of immigrations
   and emigrations between neighboring populations of different sizes.
   Dispersal patterns were close to patterns simulated under a conditional
   dispersal and with populations near saturation level. Local growth rates
   of the 11 sites were computed and did not support the idea that the
   observed balanced exchanges could be the result of a source-sink system.
   This is the first empirical evidence for a system of discrete habitat
   patches with component populations that exist as simultaneous sources
   and sinks to their neighbors. Dispersal propensities were inversely
   related to population sizes, which showed little variation in time.
   These results are consistent with recent modeling of dispersal as an
   evolutionarily stable strategy, and they demonstrate that dispersal can
   be an active phenomenon requiring neither the dominance hierarchies nor
   the temporal instability generally invoked by ecological and population
   genetic models. We note a parallel to the concept of Ideal Free
   Distributions and discuss implications for the evolution of dispersal
   mechanisms in fragmented populations.}},

Abstract = {{Bird populations and habitat were monitored each year before (1984 to
   1986), during (1987 to 1988), and after (1989 to 1996) a major gypsy
   moth (Lymantria dispar) outbreak in the eastern panhandle of West
   Virginia. Extensive tree mortality caused by repeated defoliations by
   gypsy moths resulted in the release of understory vegetation. Densities
   of Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) were significantly higher
   in the period following the gypsy moth outbreak. Both before and after
   the outbreak, Eastern Towhee densities were higher in areas of the
   forest with less overstory (particularly high canopy) and lower
   densities of live trees (particularly small trees). This indicates that
   not all forms of early successional habitat, specifically areas with a
   high density of small-diameter trees, are suitable for species deemed as
   `'early successional.'' Although the gypsy moth outbreak resulted in an
   increase in the number of saplings, it also opened up the canopy and
   created a dense layer of shrubs in many areas. Because Eastern Towhees
   forage and nest on the ground and in shrubs, the outbreak increased the
   amount of suitable habitat for this species. Given that densities of
   Eastern Towhee are declining in the state, it is useful to document
   habitat features that are important for sustaining towhee populations.}},

Abstract = {{In India, crops vulnerable to rodent attack include rice and wheat
   cereals and coconut, cacao and oil palm plantations. Bandicota
   bengalensis, Rattus rattus, Tatera indica, Meriones hurrianae, Millardia
   meltada and Mus sp. are the principal rodents associated with crop
   damage. In rice 0.005\% bromadiolone in bait stations at 15 m interval
   provided 88.3\% control success. Based on live burrow count and baits
   placed directly in the burrows, the percent control was estimated at
   98.8\%. Increased yield was recorded in fields treated with bromadiolone
   as against those of warfarin, zinc phosphide and no treatment. Optimum
   time of control is six weeks after transplantation. In wheat, which is
   followed by rice in many areas, bromadiolone bait reduced more than 98\%
   of the rodent population. In coconut plantations, with an average damage
   of 45.3 nuts/palm/year, amongst a single method of trapping only,
   warfarin baiting, zinc phosphide baiting and bromadiolone cakes, the
   latter provided 100\% success at the rate of 2 cakes or 33 g/palm in
   treated plots as indicated by fallen nuts. Single climbing to the crown
   in case of bromadiolone is an extra advantage in the form of saving in
   labour in comparison to warfarin and zinc phosphide, also providing
   100\% success. Cacao intercropped with coconut were treated with
   bromadiolone wax cakes tied at the fonds at a rate of 2 cakes per tree.
   After 15 days of treatment, damage was completely reduced. The working
   index of Economic Threshold Level (ETL), schedule of control operations,
   monitoring techniques and other integrated measures are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Johnstone's Whistling Frog, Eleutherodactylus johnstonei, is a highly
   successful colonizer that has become widely distributed throughout the
   Caribbean region. It has been introduced both purposefully and
   unintentionally by humans, and it continues to expand its range locally
   and regionally. Its current distribution and recent expansion do not
   support the hypothesis that E. johnstonei is expanding into new habitats
   exclusively by outcompeting native species. Instead, its range expansion
   progresses mainly parallel to human expansion (habitat disturbance
   through land development) and extreme climatic events (habitat
   disturbance through hurricanes and volcanism). Once a habitat has been
   disturbed and E. johnstonei has arrived, any previously existing endemic
   Eleutherodactylus species tend not to be found again at their previous
   ranges or population densities. The most probable explanation for this
   is that the broader physiological tolerance of the ecological generalist
   E. johnstonei allows it to become permanently established in a disturbed
   biota, whereas ecologically specialized endemics are prevented from
   recolonizing such habitats. Invasion of E. johnstonei can result in a
   parapatric distribution with endemics (e.g. E. euphronides, E. shrevei)
   or in sympatry (e.g. E. martinicensis), and habitats include areas with
   widely divergent climatic conditions (e.g. xeric: Anguilla, Barbuda;
   mesic: Grenada, St Vincent). Management for this species includes
   prevention of further or repeat introductions, close monitoring of
   ranges, and preservation of native habitats to ensure survival of local
   endemics.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual mode in colonial animals is expressed at the zooid, colony, and
   genet level; all three must be characterized to understand sexuality in
   these animals. I carried out such an examination of the sexual mode of a
   colonial kamptozoan (entoproct), Barentsia hildegardae, at Friday
   Harbor, Washington. Calyces never contained both ovaries and testes, and
   colonies never contained both male and female calyces. Calyces and
   colonies (including replicate colonies from the same genet) monitored
   over two years did not change sex. These results suggest that B.
   hildegardae is comprehensively gonochoric. For comparison, I examined
   the sexual mode of five other species in the genus Barentsia. Barentsia
   benedeni, B. conferta, and B. ramosa also appear to be comprehensively
   gonochoric. Barentsia discreta is hermaphroditic at the colony level,
   with gonochoric calyces whose sex is environmentally determined, as
   noted by previous workers. Barentsia aggregata has simultaneously
   hermaphroditic calyces; this was reported by the authors who described
   it, but has escaped notice in subsequent reviews of kamptozoan biology.
   There are thus three contrasting modes of sex within the genus
   Barentsia. All three modes also occur in colonial cnidarians, and two of
   them are known in bryozoans, colonial hemichordates, and colonial
   urochordates. These disparate sexual modes may have evolved as
   adaptations to differing environmental conditions or population
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{The demography of red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris removed from three
   different source areas and reintroduced between February 1987 and
   January 1988 in an urban park near Antwerp, Belgium was monitored for
   six years. Animals that were used to human presence had a higher initial
   survival than those not accustomed to human disturbance. Contrary to our
   predictions, woodland structure at the removal site did not affect a
   squirrel's settlement success, and post-release survival of subadults
   was not higher than that of adults. Only three (33\%) introduced males,
   and five (50\%) females survived to produce offspring. Reproductive rare
   was density-dependent and tended to increase with food abundance (tree
   seed crop of beech and oak). Consequently, population growth was high
   the first three years (low density) and decreased after 1990 (high
   density), when both adult and post-breeding densities (0.8-0.9
   squirrels/ha) remained stable, suggesting the reintroduced population
   had reached its equilibrium density. We discuss some guidelines to
   increase the success of red squirrel reintroduction projects. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The developmental rate of Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) was
   determined on cucumber Cucumis sativus cv. Sandra over a range of
   constant temperatures. The lower developmental threshold (LDT) and the
   sum of effective temperatures (SET) for the pre-imaginal development
   were 10.7 degrees C and 231.1 degrees C, respectively. The rate of
   population increase was assessed as the sum of effective temperatures
   above the lower developmental threshold by monitoring the numbers of
   thrips on individual leaves of cucumber under commercial greenhouse
   conditions. Population growth was characterized by an early stochastic
   phase, corresponding to pre-imaginal development of the first
   generation, and followed by an exponential phase starting with the
   second generation, the rate of which did not vary between plants.
   Throughout the exponential phase, the rate of population growth
   increased with time/age of plant. As significant damage to cucumber may
   occur during the exponential phase of population increase, the sum of
   effective temperatures of 231 degrees C can be used to predict when
   damage is likely to start to occur.}},

Abstract = {{Cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment support a self-sustaining presettlement
   forest of eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) in which some
   trees are over 1000 years old. Many of the cliffs are also popular
   locations for recreational rock climbing. Our study employed a
   stratified random sampling design to assess the impact of rock climbing
   on populations of cliff-face and cliff-edge trees. Tree density and age
   structure were compared between four climbed and three unclimbed sites
   in the vicinity of Milton, Ontario. signs of physical damage were also
   recorded for the trees samples at each site. The results showed that
   living tree density on the cliff face was lower in climbed areas. the
   age structures of these forest showed that the numbers of older and
   younger age classes have been reduced on climbed cliff faces compared
   with unclimbed areas. A high percentage of trees on climbed cliff faces
   showed evidence of damage by humans. These trends were not as apparent
   on cliff edges where other disturbances have affected age structure. We
   recommend that cliff faces be explored for the presence of presettlement
   forest and that recreation managers of lands with exposed cliff faces
   incorporate rock climbing considerations into their management plans.
   Monitoring programs would help track levels of disturbance. Education of
   the climbing community would be the most effective long-term solution to
   limiting disturbance in sensitive areas.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the process of regulation of Unaspis yanonensis (Kuwana)
   (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) by the two introduced parasitoids. Aphytis
   yanonensis DeBach et Rosen and Coccobius fulvus (Compere et Annecke)
   (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), the temporal changes in the population
   density of U. yanonensis as well as the parasitism rates were monitored
   for eight years before and after the release of the two parasitoids in a
   Satsuma mandarin orange (Citrus unshiu Marc. (Rutaceae)) orchard. From
   2-4 years after the release, the parasitism rate by C. fulvus gradually
   increased, eventually reaching 70\%, while that by A. yanonensis showed
   a weak increase, remaining under 12\%. During this period, the host
   density decreased to about 1/100 of the initial density. After the
   drastic decrease, the host density remained under 1/60 of the level
   previous to the release for at least 2 years with the populations of
   both parasitoids persisting. To estimate the ability of the two
   parasitoids to regulate the populations of U. yanonensis, life tables of
   U. yanonensis under natural conditions and predator/parasitoid-exclusion
   (bagged) conditions were compared. It was demonstrated that C. fulvus
   and A. yanonensis impose about 70\% mortality rate on the host at mature
   adult stages and about 30\% on the host at immature adult stages. The
   results have strongly confirmed the high capability of the two
   parasitoids as biological control agents for U. yanonensis, which was
   suggested by earlier studies. However, contrary to those studies, the
   present study did not support the complementarity of the two parasitoids
   in regulating the host population, suggesting that the effectiveness of
   C. fulvus alone in regulating the host population at low levels.}},

Abstract = {{The place of origin, time of occurrence, direction of invasion, and
   maturation status of Maladera matrida Argaman immigrating into peanut
   fields were determined. The timing of massive invasion of beetles was
   correlated with that of the wheat harvest in nearby fields. More than 80
   beetles per trap were collected in the margin of peanut fields adjacent
   to wheat fields during the night after wheat harvest. Wheat fields
   rotated with peanuts and the citrus grove supported the highest
   population of immature stages during the winter months, even though all
   sites rotated with peanuts and adjacent winter crops had a similar
   population size at the 1st sampling date (approximate to 3 grubs per
   soil sample). Almost all females trapped at the first 2 wk of trapping
   (immigrants) were pre-oogenic, with undeveloped ovaries, indicating a
   high reproductive potential. The life cycle of M. matrida consisted of 2
   generations per year, with overwintering grubs emerging in April, 1st
   instars appeared in the soil sample 21 d later and 1st instars of the
   2nd generation were observed in the soil sample 57-70 d after the
   appearance of Ist instars of the 1st generation. Grub populations in the
   center of the field observed 6 wk after 1st grubs observed in the soil
   samples in the margin of the fields. The sex ratio of trapped beetles
   was female-biased (63\%), whereas a 1:1 sex ratio was found for active
   beetles on host-plant foliage. This inconsistency of the adult sex ratio
   is a result of the differences in the behavior of males and females.
   Females are attracted to males and fly for longer times and distances
   then males, therefore more females were caught in traps but 1:1 sex
   ratio was observed on foliage. The results of this study strongly
   recommend placing food-baited traps on the periphery of peanut fields at
   sprouting before wheat harvest for monitoring the population size. At
   the same time a control means should be applied only at the field
   margins.}},

Abstract = {{Regional monitoring of whiteflies, Bemisia sp., in the lower Rio Grande
   Valley of Texas was undertaken between 1991 and 1995 to determine
   seasonal abundance and spatial population dynamics of this pest. Samples
   of whiteflies were taken using yellow sticky traps along roadways and
   samples from plants at selected locations. The abundance of parasitoids
   of whiteflies was quantified from each plant sample by species. The
   number of whitefly adults on yellow sticky traps consistently increased
   dramatically during late spring and summer and declined in the fall.
   Dispersion of whiteflies on sticky traps generally changed from highly
   clumped in the spring to less clumped in the summer and early fall of
   each year. The population of the native parasitoid complex of the
   whitefly correlated with increases of whitefly populations. Six whitefly
   parasitoid species were collected routinely and identified during this
   survey. In order of decreasing abundance they were Eretmocerus sp.,
   Encarsia pergandiella, Encarsia meritoria, Encarsia sp. nr. strenua,
   Encarsia luteola, and Encarsia formosa. Population levels were higher
   for whitefly and lower for whitefly parasitoids in 1995 than observed in

Abstract = {{Adult face flies, Musca autumnalis DeGeer, overwinter in reproductive
   diapause. In this study, we monitored temperature in a hibernaculum, and
   periodically assessed cold hardiness of flies from this site. Of flies
   collected in Keats, KS (39 degrees 13' N, 96 degrees 42' W) in late
   December and January, approximate to 40\% exposed to -15 degrees C for 5
   h froze internally, whereas, the remainder successfully supercooled. Of
   flies collected in February, approximate to 70\% froze internally. All
   flies that froze internally died. In December and January, all flies
   that did not freeze recovered fully and immediately, whereas in February
   nearly 80\% of the flies that avoided freezing were killed or impaired.
   Unfed flies held at room temperature (23 degrees C) for 8 h and then
   subjected to -15 degrees C for 5 h had low crystallization temperatures,
   but were killed by chilling injury, Flies that were warmed, allowed
   food, and then held at 4 degrees C overnight before being exposed to -15
   degrees C had higher crystallization temperatures than unfed flies.
   These data indicate that fully acclimatized face flies in midwinter are
   susceptible to freezing but not direct chilling injury, and that
   susceptibility to freezing and chilling injury in overwintering flies
   increases progressively with time. The laboratory studies show that,
   when warmed. diapause-induced and cold-acclimatized flies will take
   available food. Results from the laboratory studies suggest that flies
   warmed by exceptionally mild temperatures in midwinter are more
   susceptible to chilling injury from subsequent sudden cold weather, and
   that feeding when warmed increases crystallization temperatures. Higher
   crystallization temperatures could cause mortality under more mild
   conditions conditions that those in our test.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment and monitoring of forest health represents a key point for
   environmental policy and for the management of environmental resources.
   With the renewed interest in assessment and monitoring of forest health
   generated by the suspected occurrence of a widespread forest decline in
   Europe and North America, many activities have been undertaken: however,
   some questions should be considered and clarified when attempting to
   estimate forest health. Particularly, the objective(s) of the assessment
   and monitoring program should be carefully identified. Identification of
   a program's task has a number of implications and consequences: it
   implies a definition of what concept of forest health (forest ecosystem
   health, forest health or forest trees health?) is assumed, what will be
   the target entity to be monitored, and therefore the identification of
   the relevant assessment questions and assessment endpoints. Consequences
   concern the definition of the spatial scale (from international to
   landscape and plot scale monitoring) and ecological coverage (from
   single species population to population of ecosystems) of the program,
   which can have a considerable influence on the choice of the proper
   sampling strategy and tactic, as well as on the most suitable methods,
   indicators and indices to be used. Although much of the work in the
   field of forest health and air pollution has concentrated on surveys on
   crown transparency and discoloration, there is an entire range of
   methods, indicators and indices developed to assess the health status of
   forests. The decision as to which ones should be used will depend on the
   aim of the program and on economic and practical considerations. A
   further consideration concerns the time span of the program, but any
   decision in this field is subject to many limitations due to
   difficulties in predicting future monitoring needs. All these points
   should be carefully considered and implemented according to a rigorous
   Quality Assurance procedure since any decision will influence future
   work for many years.}},

   thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis Perg., WFT) adult population
   densities were monitored during 1993 and 1994 in field tomatoes in
   Northeastern Spain. The proportion of viruliferous WFT adults in field
   populations was quantified. A significant association has been found
   between early population densities of WFT adult thrips and final TSWV
   incidence for early transplanted tomato crops. In contrast, for late
   transplanted tomato crops, whereas similar high final disease incidences
   of TSWV could be attained, very low WFT adult population densities were
   always detected. The significantly higher infectious potential of WFT
   populations collected during the early growth stages of late
   transplanted tomatoes could be relevant for the TSWV incidences attained
   in spite of the low thrips numbers detected.}},

Title = {{Differential response of migratory subpopulations to winter habitat loss}},

Abstract = {{1. In a previous paper (Goss-Custard et al. 1995), a demographic model
   suggested that different breeding subpopulations of a migrating
   shorebird, the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, that shared the same
   wintering area might be affected in different ways by the progressive
   reduction of their winter habitat. Initially, as winter habitat was
   removed in simulations, all subpopulations decreased in parallel.
   However, as habitat loss continued, the subpopulations with lower
   fledgling production began to be disproportionately affected. This paper
   explores what caused this difference in response between subpopulations.
   2. A simplified version of the model was used in which two or four
   subpopulations wintered in one area. Two simple density-dependent
   functions were included, one for breeding territoriality and one for
   winter mortality, with density dependence starting only above a certain
   threshold density. Each pair that acquired a breeding territory reared a
   constant number of hedged young each year.
   3. As winter habitat was reduced, the reduction in population size of
   the subpopulations with lower reproductive rates began to accelerate as
   soon as the point was reached when all adults were breeding. Before this
   point, breeding birds that had died in the winter had been replaced by
   non-breeders. After this point, the subpopulation reproductive output
   was not sufficient to replace birds dying in the winter. At the same
   time, winter mortality rates remained high as winter densities were
   sustained by birds from the other subpopulations.
   4. The results suggest that, in order to detect the first effects of
   winter habitat loss, conservationists should pay special attention to
   monitoring breeding numbers in local subpopulations with below average
   rates of reproduction. The results also suggest that the cause of a
   decline in some local breeding subpopulations, when others remain
   stable, may need to be sought on the wintering grounds and not in the
   breeding localities themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Baseline susceptibility of European corn borer larvae, Ostrinia
   nubilalis (Hubner), to a commercial formulation of Bacillus
   thuringiensis Berliner Subsp. kurstaki (Dipel ES), was determined for
   colonies from 3 different geographic locations. The KS-NE colony,
   collected near Manhattan in northeast Kansas, was more tolerant to Dipel
   than those collected from near St. John in south central Kansas (KS-SC
   colony) and colonies provided by the USDA Corn Insects Laboratory in
   Ames, IA (Iowa colony). Five colonies of European corn borers were
   exposed to laboratory selection using a meridic diet incorporating Dipel
   ES. Decreasing susceptibility of European corn borer to Dipel ES was
   observed in each colony selected. In the colony collected in south
   central Kansas (KS-SC), the LC50 and survival of larvae at specific
   concentrations increased more rapidly than it did in the other colonies.
   After only 3 selected generations, the LC50 of this colony increased
   35.8-fold, and after 7 selected generations, it reached 72.9-fold. The
   LC(50)s of the 3 Iowa colonies increased 25.0- to 35.2-fold after 9-14
   selected generations. The LC(50)s of the colony collected in northeast
   Kansas increased 16.2-fold after 4 selected generations and it reached
   35-fold after 6 selected generations. This indicates that European corn
   borer populations can respond rapidly to intense selection pressure with
   a commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis. The LC(90)s of the 5
   colonies also increased significantly in a pattern similar to that
   observed in the LC(50)s, but the increases in LC(90)s were not as large
   as the increases for the LC(50)s. The bioassay data suggest that a dose
   of approximate to 2.4 mi Dipel per kilogram of diet could be used as a
   preliminary discriminating dose. Neonates from field-collected insects
   could be placed on diets incorporating this concentration of Dipel to
   monitor for changes and regional differences in susceptibility among
   field populations of European corn borer. Studies on the genetic basis,
   the mechanism of action, and the stability over time (in the absence of
   selection pressure) of this change in susceptibility remain to be
   carried out.}},

Abstract = {{Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), is gradually spreading in North
   America from New England to the west and south. Monitoring this
   expansion is important for evaluating effects of population management
   on the rate of gypsy moth spread, for planning areas regulated by
   domestic quarantine, and for accurate timing of preventive silvicultural
   measures. Spread rate was measured as the distance between population
   boundaries in consecutive years. Gypsy moth population boundaries from
   1988 to 1995 were estimated in northwestern Virginia and southeastern
   West Virginia using counts of male moths in pheromone-baited traps.
   Population boundaries estimated using the 10 moths per trap threshold
   were most stable in space and time compared with the boundaries
   estimated for other thresholds ranging from 1 to 300 moths per trap.
   Thus, the 10 moths per trap threshold is reliable for the monitoring of
   gypsy moth spread. Local spread rates were significantly autocorrelated
   in space (range, 80 km) but not in time. The rate of gypsy moth spread
   decreased from 16.9 km/yr in 1984-1990 to 8.8 km/yr in 1991-1996. An
   8-km intertrap distance was adequate for detecting this decline in the
   rate of gypsy moth spread.}},

Abstract = {{Five genotypes of wheat, Triticum aestivum L. ('Arapahoe', `Halt', PI
   137739, PI 225245, and PI 262660), were compared for their antixenotic
   effects on the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko).
   Comparisons were made by host plant choice tests, diurnal and nocturnal
   probing behavior of D. noxia, and examination of leaf trichome and
   epicuticular wax structure. The choice test showed that PI 137739 and PI
   225245 were the least preferred hosts among the 5 genotypes evaluated.
   Electronic monitoring of D. noxia probing behavior showed that the
   aphids fed differently among the 5 wheat genotypes, and aphid probing
   behavior was different between diurnal and nocturnal periods. Although
   the number of probes per aphid was not different among the 5 genotypes
   either diurnally or nocturnally, the accumulative probing duration per
   aphid during the 8-h recording period was different. The least probing
   duration per aphid was on PI 137739 diurnally, but no differences were
   found among the 5 genotypes nocturnally. Furthermore, aphid piercing
   duration per probe was significantly longer on PI 137739 than on
   Arapahoe. D. noxia probing (i.e., salivation and ingestion) duration per
   probe was significantly different among the 5 wheat genotypes and
   between diurnal and nocturnal periods. The aphids had the shortest
   probing duration on PI 137739 among the 5 genotypes diurnally and
   nocturnally. Irrespective of genotype differences, total probing
   duration per aphid was significantly longer nocturnally than diurnally.
   Aphids made numerous short probes diurnally and fewer long probes
   nocturnally. Adaxial leaf surface examination showed that PI 137739 dad
   the longest trichomes and medium density, whereas Arapahoe and Halt had
   the shortest trichomes and the highest density. Examination of adaxial
   leaf epicuticular wax showed that its ultrastructure was similar among
   the 5 wheat genotypes, although the density of wax flakes varied among
   the genotypes. We concluded that Halt and PI 262660 were not antixenotic
   to D. noxia, but the PI 137739 and PI 225245 were antixenotic to D.

Abstract = {{Questionnaires on pesticide use and pest management practices were
   mailed to landscape maintenance/lawn care firms in the metro-Atlanta
   area; 25.4\% or 350 firms responded. Of these firms, 159 provide pest
   management services for turfgrass or ornamentals or both. Responding
   professionals purchased 13,210 kg AI of insecticides, 93,441 kg AI
   herbicide, and 3,867 kg AI of fungicides during 1993. Total area
   serviced by these firms was 14,770 ha. The most commonly-purchased
   insecticides included products containing hydramethylnon, acephate,
   chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, and horticultural oil. Frequently-purchased
   herbicides included products that contain pendimethalin, 2,4-D,
   glyphosate, MCPP, dicamba, oryzalin, benefin, and oxadiazon. Fungicidal
   products purchased by the most respondents were chlorothalonil,
   thiophanate-methyl, oxazoladinadione, matalayl, and triadimefon.
   Insecticides were most frequently applied to ornamentals (65\%), while
   herbicides were the primary pesticide used on turf (93\% preemergence,
   79\% postemergence). Fungicides were more evenly distributed.
   Prescheduled applications determined timing of application for 32\% of
   respondents, while 46\%, report that monitoring of pest populations
   influences treatment decisions. Only 8\% of respondents incorporate
   monitoring of beneficial arthropods into this decision-making process.}},

Abstract = {{The population dynamics of the silverleaf whitefly (SLWF), Bemisia
   argentifolii Bellows and Perring (= sweetpotato whitefly, B. tabaci
   Biotype ``B{''}, {[}Gennadius]), and its endemic parasitoids (mostly
   Encarsia spp. {[}Aphelinidae]) were monitored in a heterogeneous
   cropping area, consisting of cotton, cantaloupe and kenaf(tall fiber
   crop). To assess the suitability of the whitefly for areawide pest
   management, we compared estimates of population densities using
   different sampling methods and determined the effects of agronomic
   practices on the whitefly and parasitoid populations. There was no
   correlation between adult SLWF estimates using sticky traps and those
   counted directly on the leaves. However, counts of immatures using disk
   subsamples were found to be good predictors of whole leaf counts. SLWF
   counts were law in cotton, until the han est period of cantaloupes,
   which may have triggered migration from cantaloupe to cotton. The
   determinants of emigration from cotton were less clear. High numbers of
   adults were migrating well before harvest or the application of a
   defoliant, One likely contributing factor in triggering whitefly
   migration was leaf senescence. Despite rather high adult densities
   sampled in kenaf, populations of immature SLWF were low, suggesting that
   it is not a preferred host. Parasitoid populations were high in the
   kenaf fields, causing 20 to 80\% parasitism and suggesting that kenaf
   could serve as a reservoir of natural enemies within a larger cropping
   system, Parasitism in cotton was less than that in kenaf, usually at -10
   to 15\%. Encarsia spp, sampled on sticky traps indicated significant
   activity of the adults in the cotton and kenaf fields, and much lower
   numbers in the cantaloupe. Because it is a dispersive and polyphagous
   pest, areawide suppression of SLWF must include the consequences of
   farming practices and cropping patterns in heterogeneous fields,
   especially when they are under different management.}},

Abstract = {{The form of the primary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)
   for ozone has been a matter of some concern in recent years. The
   Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing the ozone NAAQS and has
   proposed a set of alternative standards that address some deficiencies.
   However, the proposed alternatives are all based upon the ozone
   concentrations occurring at the peak monitor, which may riot be
   representative of the air quality and population exposure throughout a
   nonattainment area. Representativeness could be improved by converting
   the form of the standard from an exceedance-based metric (with x
   allowable exceedances per year, on average) to one based upon exposure.
   Three approaches to defining an exposure-based standard are developed
   here. Data from the San Francisco Bay area are used to illustrate the

Abstract = {{During June 1993 and 1994, 11 radiocollared and 7 unmarked grizzly bears
   (Ursus arctos) were monitored visually (observation) from fixed-wing
   aircraft to document predation on calves of the Porcupine Caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus) Herd (PCH) in northeastern Alaska, Twenty-six (72\%)
   grizzly bear observations were completed (greater than or equal to 60
   min) successfully (median duration = 180 min; +/-95\% CI = 136-181 min;
   range = 67-189 min) and 10 were discontinued (duration less than or
   equal to 24 min) due to disturbance to the bear, or unfavorable weather
   conditions. Of the 26 successfully completed observations, 15 (58\%)
   included predatory activity (encounter) directed at caribou calves and 8
   (31\%) included kills. Of 32 encounters, 9 resulted in kills, for a
   success rate of 28\%. The median duration of encounters was 1 minute
   (+/-95\% CI = 1-2 min: range = 1-6 min: n = 32; ), and the median time
   spent at a kill was 14 minute (+/-95\% CI = 9-23 min: range = 6-56 min;
   n = 9). Sows with young (n = 4) killed more frequently (75\%; P =
   0.0178) than barren sows, boars, and consorting pairs combined (17\%; n
   = 18). Estimated kill rate was highest for sows with young (6.3
   kills/bear/day; n = 4), followed by barren sows (4.6 kills/bear/day; n =
   5), boars (1.9 kills/bear/day; n = 5), and, finally, consorting pairs
   (1.0 kills/bear/day; n = 8). Estimated kill rate obtained via
   conventional radiotracking point surveys (4.8 kills/bear/day) was higher
   than that obtained via concurrent bear observations (3.1
   kills/bear/day). Our research provides baseline estimates of predation
   rates by grizzly bears on caribou calves that will enhance the
   capability of wildlife professionals in managing populations of both
   predators and their prey.}},

Abstract = {{Many agencies use data on hunter success and harvest composition to
   guide decisions about black bear (Ursus americanus) management, despite
   well-known limitations of such data. The likely influence of natural
   food abundance on harvests has been acknowledged, yet few studies have
   examined this relation. We conducted a simple survey, employing
   subjective ratings by experienced observers, to monitor food abundance
   across Minnesota's bear range, and used these data to interpret a
   le-year record of hunting success and harvest composition. Percent
   females in the harvest, mean age of females killed, and hunting success
   were related inversely to fall food abundance, particularly hazelnuts
   (Corylus spp.) and acorns (Quercus spp.). Percent females in the
   harvest, mean age of females killed, and estimated harvest rates for
   most sex-age classes, particularly adult females, also increased with
   increased number of hunters. After accounting for fall food and number
   of hunters, the estimated size of the bear population appeared to have
   little effect on hunting success and harvest sex ratio; that is, bear
   harvest data apparently yielded little insight into population status.
   Despite the simple format and subjective nature of our food survey, it
   adequately explained most of the year-to-year variation in hunting
   success and the sex-age composition of the harvest.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term data (1949-55 and 1959-80) from a canvasback (Aythya
   valisineria ria) population near Minnedosa, Manitoba suggested that
   breeding density was limited to less than or equal to 4.5 pairs/km(2) by
   annual variation in reproductive success (the local-recruitment
   hypothesis). We attempted to test this hypothesis by experimentally
   increasing-reproductive success on a 15.8-km(2) study block during
   1983-90, Manipulations included barrier fences to protect canvasback
   nests from mammalian predators and egg additions to replace canvasback
   eggs that had been displaced due to parasitic egg-laying by redheads
   (Aythya americana). We monitored breeding pair density and duckling
   production on the experimental study block and on an adjacent 15.8-km(2)
   control block using complete pair and brood counts (1983-90), nest and
   brood monitoring, (1983-90), and roadside pair and brood surveys
   (1983-94). We nasal-marked pre-fledgling and adult female canvasbacks
   and used mark-resighting analysis to estimate juvenile survival, adult
   survival, and resighting probabilities. Reproductive success varied
   substantially among years, primarily in response to variable wetland
   conditions. The experimental study block had higher per capita fledging
   success during 6 out of 8 years (P = 0.08), but survival and resighting
   rates did not differ between study blocks (P = 0.28-0.80), Indices of
   canvasback density were similar during 1983-84, but pair populations
   became higher on the experimental block during 1985-90 (P < 0.01). By
   1988, canvasback density on the experimental block reached 8.6
   pairs/km(2), which was 1.8 times the highest density recorded on the
   control block. Differences in pair density persisted during the
   posttreatment years of 1991-94 (P < 0.003; except 1993: P = 0.72),
   although posttreatment duckling production did not differ between the 2
   study blocks (P > 0.16). Annual changes in pair density were correlated
   positively with adult survival (r = 0.69, P = 0.007) and hedged
   ducklings/hen (r = 0.62, P = 0.02), although neither correlation
   remained significant when the other factor was controlled with partial
   correlation (P = 0.24 and 0.63). Population simulations suggested that
   both factors were important in affecting population changes, Management
   actions that enhance local breeding success or annual survival should
   lead to larger local breeding populations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1262-1267}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We broadcast calls of grebes, rails, and bitterns, and passively counted
   other species, along 36 survey routes in Mine wetlands during 1989-92.
   Our objectives were to determine the magnitude and temporal variation in
   waterbird call-response rates, and to estimate, through computer
   simulation, the statistical power of variously configured monitoring
   programs. Average call-response rates on survey mini-routes ranged from
   2.8 to 6.0 responses per 10-station mini-route, and temporal variation
   in counts was relatively high (CV in all species > 80\%). A power
   analysis, performed by coupling Monte Carlo methods with linear
   regression, indicated that changes in call-response rates of 10\% would
   be difficult to detect over a 10-year monitoring period in any species.
   Changes of 25\%, however, could be detected reliably (P > 0.90) by
   surveying 40-80 mini-routes on 2-3 occasions annually. Passive counts at
   call-response stations yielded useful abundance information on many
   wetland species currently undersampled by existing avian monitoring
   schemes. We conclude that call-response surveys for selected species,
   coupled with passive counts of other species, are a logistically
   feasible and statistically defensible means of monitoring trends in
   regional populations of wetland birds.}},

Abstract = {{Coelomocytes were extruded from three earthworm species: Lumbricus
   terrestris, Eisenia fetida and Octolasion tyrtaeum. Featuring a simple
   low-vacuum holding device, the proposed methodology allows the recovery
   of cells with;minimum risk of contamination by faecal material. The
   viability of O. tyrtaeum coelomocytes was highly reproducible (average
   93\%), with an average yield of 0.92 x 10(6) viable cells per earthworm.
   Cell. viability for L. terrestris and E. fetida averaged similar to 68\%
   but the cell yields were higher (respectively 1.67 x 10(6) and 1.28 x
   10(6)). Large inter-individual differences in cell yields were observed
   with L, terrestris. Flow cytometric analyses indicated species to
   species differences in cell populations. Coelomocytes from E, fetida
   were the smallest with similar to 57\% of the total, viable cells
   recovered being monitored between 2 and 10 mu m. Large granulated cells
   (greater than or equal to 20 mu m) were detected in fairly large
   proportions in L, terrestris and O, tyrtaeum (similar to 52 and similar
   to 96\%, respectively) while they were less abundant in E, fetida
   (similar to 9\%). Using the vital dye neutral red to assess functional
   integrity, average cellular uptakes were significantly higher for L,
   terrestris and O, tyrtaeum than for E, fetida (2.94, 2.66 and 0.64 mu
   g/2 x 10(5) cells, respectively). In summary, the extrusion methodology
   herein described is applicable for the recovery of coelomocytes from a
   wide range of earthworm sizes and species. Moreover, this study
   strengthens the fact that extruded coelomocytes could be used for the
   evaluation of cell dysfunction and/or cell death following an in vitro
   and/or in vivo treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of release and uptake of lead and zinc in blue mussels have been
   used to assess the environmental impact of a lead-zinc mine in
   Greenland. Blue mussels were transplanted from a clean area to highly
   polluted sites near the mine, and also from a highly polluted site to a
   clean area. The uptake and release of lead were found to be slow
   processes. After two to three years of accumulation the level in the
   transplanted mussels reached the level of the resident population. After
   two to three years in a clean environment the release of lead ceased,
   and the mussels seem be able to depurate only about half of the had
   originally taken up. The pattern of uptake and release of zinc was not
   as clear as for lead indicating a certain regulation capability of the
   mussels. When pollution with lead in the environment decreases, resident
   mussel populations were found not to be useful as monitoring organisms.
   Transplantation of mussels seems to be a good monitoring tool in that
   situation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two basic monitoring designs are available for detecting changes in
   plant density for monitoring studies: temporary and permanent plot.
   There are advantages to both methods. We used data from 3-year
   monitoring studies for 12 species to compare the designs with respect to
   sample size requirements. For each of the designs, statistical models of
   plant density and hypothesis tests were formulated. Monitoring data were
   used to compute the approximate minimum number of plots required to
   maintain a set level of power for both designs. The temporary plot
   designs required at least twice as many plots as the permanent plot
   designs for 10 of 12 species. However, the advantage of permanent plot
   designs was greatest for long-lived perennials and least for annuals and
   short-lived perennials. We discuss the trade-offs involved when choosing
   between these two sampling methods.}},

   does it possess an Achilles heel?}},

Abstract = {{Plant and tiller demography of a C-4 perennial bunchgrass, Eriochloa
   sericea, were evaluated to define specific traits that contribute to its
   sensitivity to herbivory by domestic grazers. We tested three
   hypotheses: (1) defoliation adversely impacts tiller recruitment to a
   greater extent than mortality, (2) tiller recruitment and/or mortality
   are particularly sensitive to defoliation at the time of culm
   elongation, and (3) synchronous tiller recruitment contributes to a
   meristematic limitation which constrains growth following defoliation.
   Demographic variables were monitored on permanently marked plants and
   tillers that were defoliated at various frequencies and stages of
   phenological development for two successive years. Hypotheses one and
   three were rejected because defoliation adversely impacted per capita
   tiller mortality to a greater extent than per capita tiller recruitment
   and tiller recruitment occurred throughout the spring and summer, rather
   than synchronously. Apical meristem elevation in vegetative tillers did
   not extend beyond 5 mm above the soil surface and the proportion of
   reproductive tillers did not exceed 10\% of the total number of tillers.
   Low values for both morphological attributes indicate that they did not
   contribute to a meristematic limitation constraining leaf growth.
   Hypothesis two was not rejected because cumulative, but not per capita,
   tiller recruitment was reduced to a greater extent by defoliation during
   culm elongation than during the pre-culm or post-culm stage. Plants that
   received multiple defoliations exhibited the greatest decline in basal
   area and tiller number compared to undefoliated plants, and only the
   undefoliated plants and plants defoliated during the pre-culm stage
   recruited a sufficient number of tillers to offset tiller mortality. In
   spite of the adverse effects of two of the four defoliation regimes, we
   were unable to identify a specific trait (i.e., Achilles heel) within
   this species that contributed to a meristematic limitation and
   herbivory-sensitivity. An alternative interpretation of
   herbivory-sensitivity is proposed which emphasizes the involvement of
   more subtle extrinsic mechanisms, including herbivore-mediated
   competitive interactions and drought-herbivory interactions. Assessment
   of herbivory resistance based on the `specific trait approach' fails to
   recognize and address the importance of extrinsic mechanisms associated
   with herbivore-induced processes at higher ecological scales.}},

Abstract = {{Nest site quality and egg predation are two important components of
   breeding success in birds. Here we study the role of pallid swift nest
   site quality and of predation by rats in explaining swift abundance and
   distribution on Mediterranean islands. First, we monitored the breeding
   success in natural nests on a rat free island in relation to physical
   features of nest sites and to meteorological conditions in order to
   understand the impact of weather on breeding success. Second, we
   inferred the impact of nest predation by rats empirically from the
   comparison of the distribution of rats and swifts on the islands. Third,
   we studied the impact of rats on swift nests experimentally by using
   artificial nests baited with quail eggs. Artificial nests were placed in
   sites mimicking extreme types of nest sites naturally used by swifts in
   relation to their accessibility to small mammalian predators. The
   experiment with artificial nests were conducted simultaneously on rat
   infested and rat free islands. Results show that the effect of
   meteorological events such as heavy summer rains on breeding success
   depends on the physical features of the nest site (depth, protection,
   number of exits). We speculate that while breeding success of some nests
   is affected by heavy summer rains these nests are at an advantage in
   case of unusually high temperatures. Experimental and observational
   results on rat predation show that rats dramatically reduce or extirpate
   local swift populations on rat infested islands. Only a small number of
   nest sites originally available to swifts will provide sufficient
   protection from predation by rats and are still used by swifts on rat
   infested islands. Rats and weather interact in a complex fashion on
   these islands in shaping the observed pattern of nest site selection and
   breeding success of swifts. The results also suggest that rats probably
   heavily influence the local diversity of bird communities and the
   regional distribution of many bird species.}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuating asymmetries are small random deviations from perfect
   bilateral symmetry that result from imperfect regulation of development.
   Recently, fluctuating asymmetry has been suggested as a tool for
   monitoring levels of ecological stress within and between populations.
   Unfortunately, such comparisons of fluctuating asymmetry may be
   confounded by genetic or age differences among environments. In this
   study we use a genetically controlled field experiment to determine
   differences in fluctuating asymmetry due solely to different competitive
   regimes. We determined fluctuating asymmetry in poplar leaf shape for
   leaves taken from an even-aged clone grown in six different competitive
   regimes. We show that increases in intra- and interspecific competition
   increase fluctuating asymmetry in the leaves of this clone. This
   supports the use of fluctuating asymmetry as a tool for detecting common
   environmental stresses such as competition.}},

Title = {{Ecological factors affecting gene flow between populations of
   Anarthrophyllum cumingii (Papilionaceae) growing on equatorial- and

Abstract = {{In the Andes of Central Chile, flowering commences 1-2 months earlier on
   equatorial-(north-) facing than on polar-(south-) facing slopes, and
   pollinator assemblages also differ between these habitats. In order to
   understand the potential influence of these differences on gene flow, we
   monitored flowering periods and insect visitation rates to flowers of 60
   individuals of Anarthrophyllum cumingii (Papilionaceae) on two
   equatorial- and two polar-facing slopes in the Andes of central Chile
   (33 degrees 35' S;70 degrees 32' W). Flowering began about 30 days
   earlier on equatorial-facing slopes. Flowering periods of individuals on
   slopes with the same aspect had a mean overlap of 0.52, while those on
   opposite slopes had a mean overlap of 0.15. On equatorial-facing slopes
   Yramea lathionoides (Lepidoptera) accounted for 60\% of the visits to
   flowers of A. cumingii, while on polar-facing slopes Centris cineraria
   (Hymenoptera) was responsible for more than 80\% of flower visits.
   Average similarities of visitor assemblages among individual plants on
   slopes with the same aspect was 0.83, while the mean similarity between
   individuals on opposite slopes was only 0.23. Within slopes fluorescent
   dyes were dispersed up to 40 m from the donor plants, but there was no
   movements of dyes between individuals growing on opposite slopes, even
   when they were separated by less than 10 m. Synchronous blooming and a
   common pollen vector are necessary conditions for pollen exchange
   between individuals. The overall probability of pollen exchange
   estimated by multiplying the inter-individual overlap for both factors,
   was nearly 0.5 for individuals growing on slopes with the same aspect,
   and less than 0.04 for individuals growing on opposite slopes.
   Consequently, at equivalent distances, the probability of pollen
   exchange between individuals growing on slopes of opposite aspect is
   more than 10-times lower than between those growing on the same slopes.
   Seed dispersal cannot compensate for restricted gene flow through
   pollination, because seeds of A. cumingii were dispersed less than 2 m
   away from a parent plant. Presumably, restricted gene flow could enhance
   genetic divergence between populations on slopes of contrasting aspects.
   This factor could be important in contributing to the high diversity and
   endemism in the Chilean Andes.}},

Abstract = {{In 1993, control failures were reported on grapevine in northern Italy
   under severe downy mildew pressure after postinfection application of
   cymoxanil in mixtures with copper or mancozeb. A monitoring survey was
   started immediately in Piedmont (north-western Italy) in order to
   determine the sensitivity of populations of Plasmopara viticola to
   cymoxanil from those vineyards where the fungicide was not controlling
   the disease satisfactorily. In 1994 and 1995, monitoring surveys were
   extended to north-eastern Italy, where cymoxanil mixtures were not
   performing as well as in the past. Sampled populations were tested on
   detached leaf discs and on whole potted plants under controlled
   conditions. In 1993, 12 populations, sampled in Piedmont, showed MIC
   values (minimum inhibitory concentration) varying from 10 to more than
   100 mg L-1 cymoxanil. With a baseline reference population having a MIC
   value of 3 mg L-1, resistance factors ranged from 3 to more than 30. In
   1994, 17 populations out of 27 sampled in Trentino (north-eastern Italy)
   showed MIC values of 100 mg L-1 or higher and in 1995, 32 populations
   out of 38 showed the same behaviour. In similar experiments, the MIC
   values of populations from nontreated plots were between 3 and 10 mg
   L-1. In whole potted plant tests, populations with MIC values higher
   than 200 mg L-1 in a leaf disc test were not controlled by 500 mg L-1 of
   cymoxanil. The results of our study suggest that resistance to cymoxanil
   in P. viticola may contribute to a lack of disease control in Italian
   vineyards.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of the system of monitoring the environmental impact on
   population health, the concentration of lead, cadmium and selenium in
   blood and cadmium in urine was measured in adults (n = 670), children (n
   = 599) and umbilical blood (n = 549) using atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry. Furthermore, cytogenetic analysis of peripheral
   lymphocytes in all population groups under study was investigated. The
   median brood Pb level for the overall group of adults (47.8 mu g/l, i.e.
   0.23 mu mol/l) was significantly higher in men (51.5 mu g/l, i.e. 0.25
   mu mol/l). Smoking significantly influenced the blood Pb level in women.
   The 90th percentile in no group exceeded the value of 100 mu g/l (0.48
   mu mol/l). The median blood Cd level in adults (0.9 mu g/l, i.e. 0.008
   mu mol/l) depends on smoking habit (1.25 mu g/l, i.e. 0.01 mu mol/l).
   The median urine Cd level was 0.585 mu g/g creatinine (0.59 mu mol/mole
   creatinine) in adults and 0.37 mu g/g creatinine (0.37 mu mol/mole
   creatinine) in children. The median blood Se level (53.5 mu g/l, i.e.
   0.68 mu mol/l) was found to be higher in the group of non-smokers (57.5
   mu g/l, i.e. 0.73 mu mol/l). Lead and selenium level were significantly
   fewer in the umbilical blood. Cytogenetic analysis results showed
   age-dependent average percentages of aberrant cells: 1.1\% in umbilical
   blood, 1.27\% in children and 1.71 in adults in line with the reference
   values for the Czech population. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Population size estimates and capture rates by various fishing
   techniques of mature estuarine bream, Acanthopagrus berda, were
   determined in the Kosi lakes system using mark-recapture methods. The
   total population size of mature A. berda was estimated to be 45 257
   (95\% confidence interval: 31 589-74 429) based on fish recaptured in
   fish traps and 56 112 (95\% confidence interval: 25 505-374 080) using
   recaptures from recreational anglers. Fish traps were estimated to catch
   about 5\% of the mature population of A. berda annually, while
   recreational rod and line angling and traditional spearfishing accounted
   for about 1\% and 0.2\% of the mature population respectively. Limited
   mark-recapture data for other species of fishes in the lakes yielded
   annual capture rates by fish traps ranging from 2.4\% to 5.8\%. These
   levels of fishing appear low enough to be sustainable, but evidence from
   a long-term monitoring programme indicates an increase in overall
   fishing effort in the Kosi lakes between 1984 and 1996 and a three-fold
   increase in the proportion of the A. berda population caught annually.
   However, there is no evidence from available catch per unit effort
   (CPUE) data that current levels of harvesting of A. berda are
   unsustainable. This needs to be confirmed through modelling of the A.
   berda stocks and continued monitoring of CPUE in all components of the
   Kosi lakes fishery. In the meantime, an increase in fishing effort
   directed at this species is not recommended.}},

   Concentrations of trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene were close to or

   of adsorption of the investigated chlorinated hydrocarbons on activated
   carbon in granules confirmed a remarkably better adsorption of

Abstract = {{Seasonal and short-term variations in abundance of bacteria and
   heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) together with environmental
   variables including chlorophyll a (chl a) were monitored in Onagawa Bay
   on the northeastern Pacific coast of Japan. Bacterial abundance varied
   within a narrow range throughout the year, while HNF abundance showed
   marked seasonal changes. Shortterm observations revealed that peaks of
   bacterial abundance were usually followed by increases in HNF abundance
   with a lag of 2 to 6 d and both abundances changed cyclically with a 4
   to 10 d period, indicating so-called predator-prey oscillations. These
   predator-prey oscillations appeared as circular orbits, or
   `predator-prey eddies', in phase space during a period shorter than ca 1
   mo. Considering the seasonal and short-term trends, we propose a new
   schematic diagram to describe seasonal changes in this predator-prey
   relationship. The relationship appears as a HNF-bacterial eddy during
   the shorter period, while the location and magnitude of the eddy in
   phase space differ with the seasons. Therefore, the annual cycle of the
   HNF-bacteria relationship is formed by a continual migration of the
   predator-prey eddy in phase space. A possible relationship between HNF
   and chl a is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Urinary excretion of ethylenethiourea (ETU) was monitored for 8 days in
   a group of five male non-smoker volunteers on a diet, the items of which
   were assayed for ETU and carbon sulphide. Urinary excretion of ETU
   reflected the consumption of wine, fruit and vegetables. Urinary ETU
   concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 6.7 mu g/g creatinine. ETU
   concentrations in the food eaten by the volunteers were generally below
   the detection limit whereas in wine 8.8 mu g/l ETU was detected.
   Evolution of carbon sulphide by food samples ranged from 0.03 to 0.17
   mg/kg. Mean (+/-S.D.) daily intake of ETU in wine was 3.5 +/- 0.2\% of
   the acceptable daily intake (ADI): 0.070 +/- 0.004 mu g/kg body wt.
   During the 8 days of the study, an average of 48.3\% of the ETU ingested
   in wine was excreted unmodified by the kidneys. Twenty-four-hour urinary
   excretion of ETU was significantly correlated with daily intake of ETU
   (r = 0.768) and CS2 evolved by the daily food items (r = 0.414). (C)

Abstract = {{Previously considered as toxin-free, the Baja California Peninsula has
   witnessed several toxic algal blooms during the past three years.
   Apparently these `red-tide' phenomena's outbreaks are not linked to any
   human related activity. This may just reflect better detection and
   training. Such events may be periodical and natural rather than induced.
   The most common types of marine toxins have been detected along the
   coast of the Peninsula and neighboring waters by mouse bioassay and
   chromatographic techniques. These are: Tetrodotoxin (TTX), Amnesic
   Shellfish Poison (ASP), Paralytic Shellfish Poisons (PSP), Diarrhetic
   Shellfish Poisons (DSP) and even Ciguatera (CFP), which are related to
   the presence of organisms of Prorocentrum sp. and Alexandrium sp.
   groups, and the diatom Psendonitzschia sp. among others. There are also
   some indications about different kinds of TTX in the puffer fish of the
   region, and reasons to believe that we are facing a quite different
   pattern in toxic components, since PSP toxic potency (defined as the
   number of mouse units per gram (MU/g) of shellfish meat) is very high in
   spite of low dinoflagellates cell density registered. The ecological and
   social impact of the above has been considerable, with mass deaths of
   shellfish, seagulls, dolphins and turtles, and even some human
   casualties. The locally registered toxicity records: PSP found in one
   single fanshell reaches to 23 000 MU/100 g of tissue as determined by
   the mouse bioassay and, on a different event, two persons killed after
   ingesting puffer fish fillet. The largest reservoir of commercial marine
   organisms in Mexico is precisely the Northwest coast of the country and
   important plans for building large harbors and develop aquaculture areas
   are in progress. Therefore, a monitoring program is essential for an
   adequate management of such resources. Considering the large extension
   of the Peninsula (about 1600 km) and, at this time, the lack of
   efficient communication means and scarce population, the implementation
   of such monitoring programs presents a big challenge.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which band structure influences the distribution of
   breeding activity is unknown for the slender-tailed meerkat Suricata
   suricatta, a cooperatively breeding mongoose. Here we present the
   residence histories of three focal bands monitored over ten band-years
   in the southwestern Kalahari, with less detailed data derived from
   non-focal bands for a further 20 band-years. Mean total band size early
   in the breeding season was 10, and mean size excluding juveniles was
   6.7. Despite a tendency towards females among juveniles, and males among
   yearlings and adults, sex ratios within each age class did not
   significantly deviate from unity, but at the population level there were
   significantly more adult males than reproductive females. A large
   proportion (71.6\%) of adult females bred, and failures of reproductive
   suppression occurred in 40\% of band years. This incidence was high in
   all years and was not obviously related to environmental conditions.
   Bands with more than one reproductive female contained significantly
   more adults and adult females than bands with only a single reproductive
   female. There was a strong correlation between numbers of reproductive
   females and numbers of adult females in a band. Most (68\%) subordinate
   females which bred were aged three years or more. Reproductive
   competition was strong and there was a negative correlation between
   numbers of adult females, breeding females or adult males and per capita
   juvenile production. Meerkat bands are unusual among cooperative
   breeders because many individuals were non-kin and the relative
   constancy in band size within and between years masked a high turnover
   of membership: all animals of known origin aged three years or older,
   were immigrants, although philopatry was commoner among younger animals.
   Our data show that meerkats employ a range of reproductive strategies:
   bands exhibiting a spectrum of reproductive suppression coexist, and
   individuals respond to the opportunities afforded by their social
   environments.}},

   Infection levels of B. bassiana on insects collected in the field and
   maintained under laboratory conditions were relatively high
   (1.6-20.5\%). The prevalence of the disease extended from spring to
   summer in the three consecutive years monitored. A local isolate of this
   fungus demonstrated high virulence (LD50 = 440 conidia/insect) against
   the locust D. maroccanus in the laboratory bioassay. The relatively wide
   host range of B. bassiana and its adaptation to the dry and hot
   conditions dominating the locust breeding ai ea suggest that this
   isolate could be consider ed in the development of a biological control
   programme against D. maroccanus.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of dewponds, the only substantive wetland habitat on the chalk
   Downs of southern England, was monitored over an area of 150 km(2)
   between 1977 and 1996 together with changes in use by the five species
   of amphibians that inhabit them. Despite a proactive pond restoration
   programme there was an overall net loss of seven pools (21\% of the
   initial number of 33) by 1996, although a higher proportion and absolute
   number of surviving ponds were in good condition in 1996 (58\%, 15
   ponds) compared with 1977 (24\%, eight ponds). Anurans (common frogs
   Rana temporaria and toads Bufo bufo) were more widespread on the Downs
   in 1996 compared with 1977, probably because they colonised new ponds
   effectively, whereas urodeles (smooth newts Triturus vulgaris, palmate
   newts T. helveticus and crested newts T. cristatus) all declined over
   the same period. T. cristatus, a species ceded maximum protection under
   the European Union Habitats Directive, occurred in nine sites in 1977
   but in just three by 1996. Total destruction of ponds was the most
   common cause of crested newt extinction, but at two sites the species
   disappeared following the establishment of fish populations. Various
   indices of amphibian diversity in dewponds are also compared. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Population trends of colonising brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula
   were monitored between 1981 and 1993 at Waipoua Forest in Northland, New
   Zealand. Canopy defoliation and possum-related damage to eight plant
   indicator species were assessed annually for four years after an aerial
   poison operation in 1990, to determine whether the operation had reduced
   possum numbers and halted possum-related damage to the vegetation. Trap
   catch estimates of possum density increased by over 70\% during the
   1980s. The poison operation killed 87\% of possums, and ongoing leg-hold
   trapping (1991-1993) maintained population levels at 7-9\% trap catch.
   Reduction of the possum population did not produce a significant
   positive short-term vegetation response, but did halt the continuing
   downward trend in vegetation condition evident in nearby forested areas
   where possum densities were not reduced. Other measures of possum impact
   (browsed foliage, stem damage) improved significantly within a year of
   the poison operation, and may prove more sensitive short-term indicators
   of reduced possum-related damage. The apparent ability of residual
   possum populations to retard vegetation recovery has important
   implications for forest health strategies based on intermittent poison
   operations. While a large initial population reduction is required to
   halt vegetation decline, an ability to maintain residual possum
   populations at very low levels appears necessary for significant
   vegetation recovery. Targetting the increased resources now available
   for reducing possum populations to fewer areas of higher conservation
   value may well return greater ecological dividends than attempts to
   sustain long-term reduction of possum populations over large areas of
   more modified indigenous forest. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Echinospartum algibicum is a very recently described species, It is
   currently only known from one population in southern Spain and is in
   serious danger of extinction as only three out of 92 living plants are
   able to flower and set fruit because of grazing. The aim of the work
   presented in this paper was to study the seed density and distribution
   in the permanent soil seed bank, and to assess the possibility of
   replenishing this species from the seed bank. A total of 101.25 litres
   of soil from 90 soil cores at three different depth levels (0-5, 5-10
   and 10-15 cm) in three different plots was sampled within the
   population. Each recovered buried seed was individually weighed and
   tested for viability, together with a sample of 30 freshly collected
   seeds, seedling development was also monitored. One hundred and thirteen
   seeds (167 seeds m(-2)) were recovered and the number of seeds was not
   statistically different among plots. Mean seed mass of buried seeds was
   significantly different between plots and also compared to fresh seeds.
   Scarification significantly increased seedling emergence, after a 20-day
   test. Germination differed among plots but not among the soil layers at
   different depths. Viable seeds had greater mean seed mass than
   non-viable seeds, but there did not seem to be a critical seed mass for
   germination. Most seedlings died before 20 weeks; therefore, despite the
   high germination percentages observed in this study both in buried and
   fresh seeds, seedling survival was extremely low. In-situ conservation
   measures and studies are suggested. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Mangroves in disparate families produce viviparous seedlings
   (propagules) that are attacked by many crab and insect predators both
   before and after dispersal. While post-dispersal predation is viewed as
   an important factor in structuring many mangrove communities,
   pre-dispersal predation rates and agents have been characterized for few
   species. Ten species of mangrove and 3299 propagules were surveyed for
   pre-dispersal propagule predation at 42 sites around the world.
   Pre-dispersal predation rates were variable among sites and species,
   ranging from 0 to 93 percent within stands, with a global total
   predation rate of 23.3 percent (across all propagules examined) and a
   mean level of 28.3 percent across sites. Grapsid crabs, Coleoptera and
   Lepidoptera were the primary predators identified. Forests near human
   population centers and stands occurring at high intertidal sites
   exhibited higher levels of propagule predation than those in unpopulated
   or low-intertidal sires. Predation rates on a species were weakly,
   negatively correlated with conspecific seedling density at a sire. To
   explore temporal variation in, and ramifications of pre-dispersal
   predation for propagule growth and abscission dynamics, Rhizophora
   mangle propagules were monitored over two years at three sires in
   Belize, Central America. Predation did not significantly reduce
   hypocotylar growth of germinated propagules on the parent tree, but
   nearly doubled the abscission race of premature propagules.
   Pre-dispersal propagule predation is a ubiquitous feature of mangrove
   forests world-wide, and must be accounted for in estimates of
   reproductive output, stand health, and propagule availability for
   forestry and restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Emergence, oviposition, and seasonal flight activity of adult, speckled
   green fruit worm, Orthosia hibisci Guenee (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were
   monitored during 1991 and 1992 in a mixed block of McIntosh and Spartan
   apple trees at Summerland, British Columbia, to establish relationships
   between the phenology of these events and degree-days (DD). Using air
   temperatures and a developmental threshold of 3 degrees C, median
   emergence of males was predicted most accurately (0-2 days) by starting
   DD summations on 1 March. Median emergence of females was predicted
   without error when first catch of a male in a trap baited with sex
   attractant was used as a population reference point (biofix) to start DD
   summation. Using a threshold temperature of 3 degrees C, observed
   cumulative emergence of females reached 50\% at 63.5 +/- 4.05 DD3
   degrees C after biofix, similar to the laboratory-derived prediction of
   61.3 +/- 4.2 DD with a threshold temperature of 2.8 degrees C. Catches
   of males with sex attractant preceded oviposition, but female catches in
   light traps lagged behind oviposition, suggesting older females were
   being caught in light traps. The oviposition curve was linear and
   parallel to the cumulative curve of male catches with sex attractant.
   Oviposition began at 26.7 DD3 degrees C and reached 50\% at 94.2 DD3
   degrees C after biofix, respectively. Weibull equations fitted to
   observed cumulative catches with sex attractant, female emergence, and
   oviposition, combined-with laboratory-derived DD models of egg and
   larval development, were used to predict phenology of O. hibisci and
   correlate it with flowering phenology of pome fruits. This study
   provides a basis for timing application of selective insecticides
   against O. hibisci based on first catch in a sex-attractant trap and DD
   summations.}},

Abstract = {{We provide a quantitative examination of the utility of escapement data
   for monitoring changes in salmonid populations caused by habitat
   alterations. We used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the precision,
   duration of monitoring, and the effect size required to achieve
   acceptable statistical inferences based on before-after (BA) and
   before-after-control-impact (BACI) comparisons. There was generally less
   than a 50\% chance of detecting a population response unless the
   population change was large (more than a twofold increase) or the
   post-treatment monitoring period long (>10 years). Statistical power was
   improved by increasing the precision of escapement estimates, but the
   extent of improvement was dependent on the magnitude of population
   response to treatment, the duration of monitoring, and the extent of
   natural variability in abundance. BACI comparisons generally had a
   10-15\% lower probability of detecting a population change than BA
   comparisons unless the degree of covariation in survival rates between
   control and treatment stocks was very strong. Autocorrelation in error,
   simulating patterns of high and low survival rates over time, generally
   reduced power by 5-15\%. Our results identify the conditions where
   escapement information can be used to make reliable inferences on
   salmonid population changes and provides a means for evaluating
   alternative monitoring designs.}},

Abstract = {{The phytoplankton community, physical variables, and nutrient and
   chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were monitored during the first two
   of six open-water seasons of hypolimnetic oxygenation in double-basined
   Amisk Lake, Alberta. Deep mixing of the water column in the treated
   basin (Z(max) = 34 m) in spring was enhanced by hypolimnetic
   oxygenation. Oxygenation began in June 1988, when stratification was
   likely already established, but subsequent year-round treatment favoured
   an extended spring diatom bloom (Asterionella formosa and Cyclotella
   spp.), followed by a delay in the development of, and reduction in the
   severity of, cyanobacterial blooms (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and
   Anabaena flos-aquae) in 1989. Historically, mean summer Chl a and total
   phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the euphotic zone (0-6 m) of the
   treated basin were 15.9 +/- 1.6 and 33.5 +/- 1.5 mu g.L-1, respectively,
   indicating a eutrophic lake. In 1988 and 1989, mean summer Chl a (10.0
   +/- 0.6 and 8.1 +/- 0.7 mu g.L-1, respectively) and TP concentrations
   (29.0 +/- 0.5 and 22.5 +/- 0.9 mu g.L-1, respectively) in this stratum
   were lower than historic values (P < 0.05), indicating that the trophic
   status of Amisk Lake had shifted towards mesotrophy.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models for the evolution of inducible anti-predator defenses
   predict that there should be fitness costs associated with the defense,
   otherwise it should be permanent. Thus, in the absence of predators and
   with limited resources, defended individuals are expected to be
   outcompeted by individuals lacking the costly defense. Crucian carp,
   Carassius carassius, increase in body depth in response to chemical
   stimuli from piscivorous fish, and the deeper body constitutes a
   morphological defense against gape-limited piscivores. Here, we have
   performed a field experiment investigating effects of population density
   on the relative competitive performance of shallow-bodied and
   deep-bodied crucian carp. We assigned groups of six individually marked
   fish (the `'focal'' individuals) of either morph into enclosures with
   either low or high crucian carp density, and monitored changes in body
   mass, length, and body depth of these fish for 4 mo. In addition, we
   determined sex, and final liver and gonadal mass, of all focal fish.
   At high population density, there was a reduction in food resources
   (zooplankters), which resulted in reduced gonad mass, reduced
   gonadosomatic indices, and reduced growth in fish of both morphs.
   Unexpectedly, the relative allocation to livers was higher at high
   density. There was no difference in body mass gain between morphs at the
   low density, whereas at the high density shallow-bodied fish gained
   twice as much body mass as deep-bodied fish. Hence, when predators were
   absent and food resources were limited, deep-bodied individuals suffered
   a substantial cost when competing with shallow-bodied conspecifics.
   This study verifies the theoretical prediction that an inducible defense
   results in fitness costs in the absence of predators. Further, as we
   found no measurable disadvantage of the deep-bodied morphology at high
   food availability but a strong disadvantage under intense competition
   for food, our results also demonstrate the importance of relating
   defense costs to levels of intraspecific competition.}},

Abstract = {{The Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service monitored bird populations in a
   clearfell coupe and an adjacent unlogged forest in dry sclerophyll
   forest in the south-east of Tasmania for one and a half years in
   1977-78. The mature forest was subsequently logged and another unlogged
   mature forest control site was added to the north. Monitoring by
   Forestry Tasmania continued for a further seven years, using a modified
   method. Numbers of birds and numbers of species were greatest in the
   mature forest and greater in the young regrowth than in the older
   regrowth. The higher numbers and species in the younger regrowth
   compared with the older regrowth are probably a result of the influence
   of older trees that were retained in sections of the young regrowth, the
   greater diversity of habitats in the young regrowth and the greater
   visibility in young regrowth. The bird faunas of the mature forest,
   older regrowth and young regrowth differed from each other. Individual
   species showed a range of responses to logging. Three species (Golden
   Whistler, Spotted Quail-thrush and Satin Flycatcher) that occurred in
   mature forest were virtually absent from regrowth.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated management plan to create favorable nesting habitat for
   the world-endangered Dalmatian pelicans, was tested at Kerkini
   irrigation reservoir, a Ramsar wetland. The lake is the major wintering
   site of Dalmatian pelicans in Europe, where the species lives year-round
   without breeding. The rise of water level at the reservoir during spring
   (exceeding 5 m) has an impact on the whole system, including several
   birds, which lose their nesting habitat. Although the integrity oi the
   wetland demands ecological restoration with changes in its hydrologic
   regime, local socioeconomic conditions allow only habitat level
   interventions. During the planning phase of the management plan, both
   the ecological and social context of the interventions were considered.
   Monitoring of all pelican habitats and populations provided the
   scientific basis, while a socioecological survey on knowledge/attitudes
   of local fishermen toward wetland identified conflicts with specific
   resources and planned management. To gain public support, a broad
   information/education program was implemented. The education program for
   fishermen was based on the findings of the socioecological survey. The
   in situ management involved experimental construction of floating rafts,
   platforms over water, dredged-spoil islands, and platforms at various
   sites of the wetland. Monitoring of the managed habitats showed that
   most waterbirds used them for resting and roosting. Common terns nested
   on the rafts, cormorants on the platforms, and Dalmatian pelicans on the
   man-made island. Under the prevailing hydrologic and weather conditions,
   islands seem to be the most suitable habitat for pelican nesting. It is
   concluded that wildlife habitat management should integrate the
   ecological component, related to the needs of the species and ecosystem,
   with the social one, expressed by cooperation and involvement of the
   local community.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibian call count surveys in Ontario use a common survey protocol. We
   evaluated the precision and accuracy of data collected by these methods.
   Multiple observers monitored the same routes to determine inter-observer
   variation. Inter-observer agreement in evaluation of calling intensity
   and occurrence was generally high, and the experience of the observer
   affected estimation of both calling intensity and the number of
   individuals calling. There was no significant increase in inter-observer
   agreement in evaluation of calling intensity or occurrence with 5-min
   versus 5-min surveys. Longer surveys rarely resulted in the
   identification of species not heard in the first 3 min. Surveys of 30-60
   min duration indicated that return for effort declined sharply during
   the second minute of the survey, although new species were sometimes
   heard after as long as 15 min. Simultaneous intensive and extensive
   monitoring was performed on populations of Fowler's toads (Bufo fowleri)
   in southern Ontario and bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) in central Ontario
   to determine whether there was a relationship between calling intensity
   and chorus size or population size.
   We found a linear relationship between call counts and chorus size in
   both species. We conclude that the data generated with the call count
   surveys were adequately precise, but accuracy remains to be validated.
   Further investigation of the relationships among population size, chorus
   size, calling intensity, and environmental factors are required to
   determine whether extensive monitoring of calling amphibians can be used
   as an index of actual population size. However, until that time, we
   recommend that calling amphibian surveys be used as the first part of an
   integrated program using extensive monitoring to identify areas where
   populations may be declining, and intensive monitoring to confirm or
   refute reports of declines.}},

Abstract = {{Completion of the Harry S Truman Dam (HST) in west-central Missouri in
   1977 blocked a major spawning migration route for walleyes Stizostedion
   vitreum and flooded the historic upstream spawning area. Creel surveys,
   a tagging study, and population monitoring suggested problems with
   walleye recruitment in the HST tailwater area. The present study was
   part of a comprehensive project conducted to determine the status of
   walleye reproduction and recruitment. In walleyes from the BST
   tailwaters we found (1) elevated serum testosterone levels throughout
   the spawning season in both sexes during 1989 and in females during
   1990, whereas testosterone levels normally decline at spawning; (2)
   elevated estradiol-17 beta (E-2) levels throughout the spawning season
   in females, whereas E-2 levels normally decline; and (3) patterns of
   serum chloride levels indicative of fish in a state of chronic
   physiological stress. These preliminary findings suggest that
   reproductive failure of walleyes at HST may be caused by the absence of
   requisite environmental signals necessary for spawning or by
   physiological stress caused by the environmental conditions at HST, or
   by both factors. We suspect that changes in water temperature and flow
   caused by the peaking-power water discharge regime (intermittent flows)
   from HST may be important factors in walleye reproductive failure in the
   tailwaters.}},

Abstract = {{Gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analyses of
   female nettle caterpillar, Setothosea asigna, pheromone gland extracts
   revealed seven antennally active compounds. Based on their retention
   indices on three fused silica columns (DB-5, DB-23, and DB-210), these
   compounds were hypothesized and, through comparative GC, GC-EAD and
   GC-mass spectrometry with authentic standards, confirmed to be Delta
   10-undecenal, dodecanal, (E)-9-dodecenal (E9-12:Ald), (Z)-9-dodecenal,
   (E)-9-dodecen-1-ol, (E)-9,11-dodecadienal (E9,11-12: Ald), and
   (E)-9,11-dodecadienol. E9-12:Ald and E9,11-12:Ald were most abundant in
   female S, asigna pheromone extracts. In field trapping experiments in
   Palembang, Indonesia, synthetic E9-12:Ald and E9,11-12:Ald at a 1:1
   ratio, but not singly, attracted S. asigna males. Attractiveness of
   these two aldehydes could not be enhanced further through the addition
   of their corresponding alcohols and/or other aldehydic candidate
   pheromone components. Use of E9-12:Ald and E9,11-12:Ald for
   pheromone-based monitoring of S. asigna populations will require lure
   formulations that minimize pheromone degradation by ultraviolet
   radiation and atmospheric oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Ninety rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were reared in three tanks
   (n=30), and their growth rate was monitored for 25 weeks. During the
   experiment, fish were fed nd libitum, and kept under simulated natural
   photoperiod and constant temperature (14 +/- 1 degrees C). Throughout
   the experiment, water quality (pH, O-2, N-NH3, N-NH4, NO2) was
   considered optimum. Two growth rate periods were observed on the
   population: first an acclimation period (weeks 1-5), followed by a
   period of general decrease in growth rate (weeks 5-25). This trend was
   modelled with a third-order polynomial function. The autocorrelation
   analysis of the fluctuations revealed a cyclicity of the growth rate
   with a 4-5-week period. This cyclicity was independent of the tanks and
   of the growth rate trend type (long- v. short-term acclimation period).
   However, at the individual level, trends as well as short-term
   fluctuations were heterogeneous and no clear cyclicity could be
   detected. The biological relevance of the population growth rate
   cyclicity and the apparent absence of similar individual fluctuations
   are discussed. (C) 1997 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution, movements, activity range, and habitat use of the
   Concho water snake, Nerodia harteri paucimaculata, were studied by
   mark-recapture and radio telemetry in a large lake system, in central
   Texas, USA. Concho water snake emigration and distribution were largely
   driven by alteration of habitat availability caused by fluctuating water
   levels. Habitat characteristics associated with the presence of snakes
   at the study area were turbid water, minimal wave action, a gentle
   shoreline gradient, a silt substrate, and a rocky shoreline. Males and
   gravid females were equally vagile, and the likelihood of a snake
   undertaking an emigrational movement was independent of age and/or
   reproductive condition. However, males had significantly more movement
   days than gravid females. Radio-tagged males had detectable movements on
   64\% of monitored days, compared to 43\% of monitored days for gravid
   females. Mean activity range length was 278 m for males, 219 m for
   gravid females, and 210 m for juveniles. Concho water snakes generally
   selected retreat sites within 3 m of water, although gravid females
   selected sites as far as 15 m from water. As a management procedure for
   lake populations, we advocate increasing the vertical distribution of
   rocky shoreline.}},

Abstract = {{Trifolium repens (white clover) stolons were inoculated with Ditylenchus
   dipsaci (stem nematode), and the development of resulting infestations
   was monitored. Nematodes initially remained confined to superficial
   locations, concentrating in petiole axils near inoculation points. They
   were able to migrate slowly from the initial inoculation points and
   infest adjacent axils, especially in regions near the stolen tip. As
   time progressed, in some axils, nematodes migrated through the stolen
   epidermis and colonized slowly expanding subepidermal pockets of host
   tissue (ca, 0.2-mm length of stolon/day). In these loci nematodes
   established exponentially increasing populations, but the rates of locus
   expansion remained constant, indicating that locus expansion was limited
   by unidentified host-dependent factors. As a result of increasing
   population pressure within subepidermal loci, J4 entered a `'diapause''
   state and the rate of egg production by adults declined, thereby
   reducing rate of population growth to more sustainable levels.
   Typically, these populations peaked at ca. 10,000 individuals in ca. 160
   days occupying S-cm lengths of stolen. Thereafter, heavily infested
   regions of stolons started to die, leading to the formation of
   longitudinal splits in their epidermis. In other axils, nematodes did
   not migrate into the stolons but remained confined to axils. Some of
   these populations increased a hundred-fold in 95 days, with population
   growth ending when petioles started to die. Host plant stolen morphology
   was affected only when subepidermal stolen populations developed high
   population levels (>100 nematodes) within close proximity (<2 cm) to
   active terminal meristems. This occurred either when axillary buds
   became active on previously infested nodes or when nematodes established
   endoparasitic populations at locations near the stolen tip during winter
   and spring, when the rate of stolen extension was limited by low light
   intensity. Affected stolen tips could `'escape'' from the influence of
   such infestations when light intensity and temperature increased.
   Nematode activity was limited by low temperature rather than light
   intensity. Global warming is likely to lead to greater damage to
   infested plants during the winter and early spring because the predicted
   milder winter temperatures will enhance nematode activity but not
   necessarily promote stolen growth.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in the botanical composition of diets and protein
   quality of forages consumed by cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus
   floridanus) were monitored on disturbed and undisturbed upland hardwood
   forest-tallgrass prairies in central Oklahoma. Our primary objective was
   to evaluate the seasonal dynamics of levels of selected amino acid
   nutrients in forages required for maintenance, growth, or reproduction,
   and explore how these changes respond to habitat disturbance resulting
   from the use of herbicides and fire. Microhistological analyses of
   stomach digesta indicated that summer diets were dominated by Panicum
   oligosanthes Schultes, Croton spp., and Sporobolus asper (Michx.) Kunth;
   winter diets were dominated by Bromus spp., P. oligosanthes, and
   Antennaria spp. Differences in the botanical composition and quality of
   diets between disturbed and undisturbed habitats were of little
   biological significance. Change in the concentration of essential amino
   acids due to plant maturity were minimal in both summer and winter.
   Estimated levels of nitrogen and essential amino acids in reconstructed
   diets (based on food habits) appeared to be low, especially for the
   sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine + cystine) in summer.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between photochemical and biological processes in the
   degradation of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated
   with seawater from a coastal southeastern U.S. salt marsh. Seawater
   supplemented with humic substances was exposed to alternating cycles of
   sunlight (equivalent to 8 h of midday sun) and dark incubations with
   natural bacterial populations (1-2 weeks in length). Photochemical
   degradation of the DOM was monitored during sunlight exposure by direct
   measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbon monoxide
   (CO) formation in 0.2-mu m filtered seawater. Bacterial degradation was
   monitored during dark incubations by tritiated leucine uptake and
   changes in bacterial numbers in bacterivore-free incubations and by
   direct measurements of DOM loss. The alternating cycles of sunlight and
   microbial activity resulted in more complete degradation of bulk DOM and
   marine humic substances than was found for nonirradiated controls (i.e.
   with microbial activity alone) by a factor of up to 3-fold. Increased
   decomposition was due both to direct losses of carbon gas photoproducts
   (DIC and CO in a 15:1 ratio) and to enhanced microbial degradation of
   photodegraded DOM, with approximately equal contributions from each
   pathway. Mass balance calculations indicated that low-molecular-weight
   carbon photoproducts, currently considered to be the compounds
   responsible for stimulating bacterial activity following
   photodegradation of DOM, were insufficient to account for the enhanced
   bacterial production observed. Thus, higher molecular weight, chemically
   uncharacterized fractions of DOM may also be modified to more
   biologically available forms during exposure to natural sunlight.}},

   environmental conditions (elevation, sediment grain size) on Balgzand, a
   50-km(2) tidal flat area. The total zoobenthic stock in the affected
   area roughly doubled within 2 yr after the doubling of the stock of
   planktonic algae. However, the magnitude of the response differed from
   station to station. We tested the hypothesis that a strong positive
   response would occur particularly at stations where food could be
   Limiting, i.e. where zoobenthic food demand was high relative to food
   supply. Biomass increases of zoobenthos in the order of a doubling were
   indeed restricted to the part of Balgzand characterized already in the
   1970s by high biomass values. The zoobenthic biomass hardly increased in
   two areas of Balgzand with relatively low values for zoobenthic biomass
   and species richness. In these impoverished areas environmental
   conditions are harsh and the benthic communities are dominated by small
   opportunistic species. One of these areas is characterized by a high
   intertidal elevation (short daily inundation periods) combined with a
   sheltered location near the coast (resulting in muddy sediments), the
   other by severe exposure to currents and wind (resulting in mobile sands
   with low silt and organic-matter contents) due to its offshore position.
   We conclude that food limitation only existed in the midshore
   communities living under relatively mild abiotic conditions. Apparently,
   the benthic consumer populations benefitted from eutrophication-induced
   enhancement of their food supply by enlargement of their stocks only
   where they were not too stressed by unfavorable abiotic conditions.}},

   of Holothuria (Halodeima) atm, H. (H.) edulis and Stichopus chloronotus
   on three nearshore fringing reefs and one midshelf reef in the Great
   Barrier Reef. Fission in S. chloronotus occurred exclusively between
   March and October, with a peak Value of 31\% recently divided
   individuals in one population in July. H. atr a showed a similar
   pattern, with maxima of between 16 and 26\% from May to July. In H.
   edulis, asexual reproduction occurred only between March and July, with
   a maximum of 17\% recently divided individuals in March. Fission rates
   of H. atr a and S. chloronotus in winter were significantly higher than
   in all other seasons. For H. atra, at least 76\% of all individuals at
   Fantome Island were estimated to undergo fission per year, whereas only
   9\% undergo fission on the midshelf reef. Highest annual fission rates
   (43\%) for S. chloronotus were found in a dense population on Great Palm
   Island. The lower-density midshelf reef population exhibited
   comparatively lower annual fission rates (19\%). About 24\% of H. edulis
   undergo fission each year. Annual fission rate and population density
   were positively correlated in the four populations of S. chloronotus and
   H. atl a studied.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of arousal from hibernation and presence of plasma androgen
   on the expression of mating behavior in male big brown bats (Eptesicus
   fuscus) sere tested in a captive population exposed to seminatural
   conditions in central Alabama. In the mild winter of 1994-1995, flight
   cage temperatures never fell below 10 degrees C. Bats were never
   observed to enter sustained (over 2 d) torpor. They were also never
   observed to mate, Unmanipulated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized males
   and unmanipulated females were exposed to 6 d of 4 degrees C. All
   individuals appeared torpid, and body temperatures of monitored bats
   fell at least 15 degrees-20 degrees C. plasma androgen levels of torpid
   unmanipulated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized males averaged 25.4 +/-
   9.2, 19.7 +/- 9.1, and 1.5 +/- 0.25 ng/mL, respectively, and did not
   differ significantly from levels for the same groups 1 mo previous to
   induced torpor. When animals were returned to 23 degrees C, 57\% of
   unmanipulated, 40\% of the sham-operated, and 33\% of gonadectomized
   males displayed mating behavior upon arousal. Almost all matings
   occurred within 48 h of arousal, the majority in the first 3 h. Males
   not exposed to low temperatures were not observed to mate. Although
   individuals from all three treatments mated, gonadectomized males
   averaged fewer mounts and copulations per individual. Androgen levels
   declined significantly from torpor levels in all groups 48 h after
   arousal. Thus, an extended period of low body temperature and arousal
   appeared to be a short-term activator of sexual behavior in the big
   brown bat; unmanipulated males were more strongly affected by this
   stimulus than gonadectomized males.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer morbidity and mortality were studied in areas of the Kaluga
   oblast contaminated with radionuclides. The main objective of the study
   was to assess the influence of radiation exposure on existing levels of
   cancer morbidity and mortality. Time trends and relative population
   risks were analysed. Based on this analysis, it was concluded that the
   current levels of morbidity from cancers among the populations residing
   in the studied areas were primarily a result of a complex of factors
   which predated the exposure from the Chernobyl accident. However, there
   seems to be an unfavourable trend concerning malignant neoplasms of the
   respiratory organs for women residing in the contaminated areas. To
   date, no statistically significant effect of radiation on cancer
   morbidity (except for thyroid cancer in women) has been noted. The
   levels of cancer morbidity and mortality in the contaminated areas
   generally reflect the changes in cancer incidence in the oblast as a
   whole. The findings are consistent with international data on latent
   periods for the induction of radiogenic cancers and the biological
   effects for similar levels of exposure to populations residing in
   contaminated territories. Further studies are necessary in order to
   monitor possible effects that are related to the accident.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work consists of monitoring the recovery process after
   five by means of satellite imagery. The objectives are to assess the
   regrowth pathways followed by different species populations after a
   disturbance, to analyze the speed of recovery in the years following
   fire, and, finally, to estimate rates of regrowth. The test area is
   located in the north of the province of Alicante, on the Mediterranean
   coast of Spain. This area, especially prone to forest fires, shows a
   remarkable land-use history and human pressure. The test areas belong to
   different microclimatic zones, show diverse vegetation communities, and
   have different degrees of stoniness; so we attempted to discover their
   postfire behaviors according to their biogeographical conditions. To
   accomplish these objectives, we used nine Landsat 5 thematic mapper
   images from 1984 to 1994 to which geometric and radiometric corrections
   were applied. Once the comparability between images was guaranteed, we
   generated a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each date.
   First, we demonstrated that the differences between NDVI images were
   suitable for mapping burned areas. Second, we undertook a nonlinear
   regression analysis between NDVI values and the time elapsed since the
   fire to assess the recovery processes. The exponential adjustment
   between NDVI and time was in accord with the asymptotic behavior
   observed when the recovery process is complete. The parameters supplied
   by the proposed method are helpful in quantifying the effects of fire on
   different ecosystem processes. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation created a shallow, 110-m channel to
   provide habitat for two endangered fishes, Cyprinodon elegans (Comanche
   Springs pupfish) and Gambusia nobilis (Pecos gambusia), at the site of
   the fishes' former natural habitat. The cienega (marsh) associated with
   Phantom Lake Spring in Jeff Davis County, Texas, was destroyed by the
   creation of an irrigation canal system. In 1993, the endangered fishes
   were stocked into the refuge with individuals from the irrigation
   canals, and in the case of C. elegans, hatchery stocks. The condition of
   habitat, status of fish populations, and fish ecology within the refuge
   were then monitored for two years. The abundance and density of both
   species increased in accordance with aquatic plant development.
   Cyprinodon elegans abundance peaked after one year and stabilized at an
   average density of 14.7/m(2) by the end of our study. Juvenile C.
   elegans were always rare, which may indicate that the population reached
   the refuge's carrying capacity and that recruitment is low. Gambusia
   nobilis was the most abundant fish in the refuge (average density
   96/m(2)), used the entire refuge, and outcompeted nonindigenous G.
   geiseri. The two Gambusia species used similar habitats but showed
   almost no dietary overlap. High densities of aquatic plants reduced the
   amount of open water areas necessary for C. elegans. The refuge will
   sustain the two endangered fishes at this historic site of endemism
   while maintaining flow to the irrigation system; however, the refuge is
   not equivalent to a restored cienega.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the utility of gap formation and soil disturbance as methods
   to enhance establishment of plant species in the understory of a
   northern Kentucky forest where Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle)
   produced dense thickets. In May 1994, gaps (5 m diameter) were cut-in
   the shrub thicket. In adjacent areas, the shrub canopy remained intact.
   Subplots were established where soil was either turned with a spade to a
   depth of 15 cm or not disturbed. We monitored plant establishment for
   three growing seasons (1994, 1995, and 1996). Shrub removal increased
   light availability to about 10\% of full sun. Gap formation had a
   significant (p < 0.05) and positive influence on total plant density
   (exclusive of L. manckii), and soil disturbance did not (p > 0.05).
   After three growing seasons, the most important species were L. maackii,
   Alliaria petiolata, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Vitis vulpina, and Acer
   negundo. Of these species, only V. vulpina showed significantly (p <
   0.05) higher densities in gaps. Other less important species such as
   Phytolacca americana, Campsis radicans, and Eupatorium rugosum occurred
   almost exclusively in gaps. Of the 44 taxa observed in this study, most
   were generalist species that also occur in early successional habitats.
   Long-term dominance of the understory by L. maackii has likely modified
   system attributes with corresponding effects on community development.
   Shrub removal provides a window of establishment for various plant
   species, but successful restoration may require further management to
   augment species availability and to control new invaders.}},

   was covered with primary forests in 1970, against 13\% in 1990, Areas
   under plantation which were not recorded in 1970, increased to 60\% in
   1990, In addition, the change from monoculture plantations (mostly
   coffee plantation) to mixed plantations was noticeable from 1984 to
   1990, Total upland area including upland area under shifting cultivation
   and upland fields with crops and vegetables only with fruit trees
   decreased from 21\% in 1970 to 0.1\% in 1990, clearly suggesting the
   establishment of plantation agriculture, mainly coffee plantations, in
   the hilly areas, and the transfer of areas for crop and vegetable
   production to the middle terraces in Lampung Province, In large areas
   land-use had changed from some forms to others at intervals of 6-8 y in
   the study site. Transmigration and resultant impact of increasing
   population were the major driving forces in land use changes.}},

Abstract = {{Early attempts to acclimatise Bombus spp. to Australia were not
   successful but a pre-1992 introduction of the bumble bee B. terrestris
   has succeeded and the species is slowly spreading in southern Tasmania.
   It is likely that the genetic base of the Tasmanian population is
   limited if, as is thought, only a few queens were brought from New
   Zealand. This may affect the rate of dispersal through the island, which
   presently averages 12.5 km/year. In 1995-96 Is feral colonies found in
   and around Hobart were transferred to nest boxes, where colony
   development could be monitored. All of the colonies produced queens, and
   the ratio of queens to workers (1:4.71) compares favourably with the
   upper end of colony performance scale in New Zealand(1:5.19). At least
   two generations are produced during warmer months and there is no
   indication of genetic impediments to further dispersal in Tasmania or
   possibly even mainland Australia. External influences such as predatory
   habits of birds, availability of food, competition from other insects
   and deliberate introduction by people into new areas make the rate of
   spread unpredictable.}},

Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Twenty-three taxa of fish have been identified from the Prespa lakes.
   Eleven of these have been introduced or translocated, and 7 of the
   remaining 12 are endemic to the Prespa lakes. This high proportion of
   endemism requires confirmation because the systematic position of
   several of the species and subspecies remains uncertain. The absence of
   a predatory fish in Mikri Prespa, the occurrence of trout in Megali
   Prespa, the presence of eels in both lakes and the occurrence of many
   rheophilous fish species typifies the fish communities of these two
   lakes. Monitoring of the fish population in Mikri Prespa, from 1984 to
   1994, showed apparent stability or a slight increase in catches during
   this period. Not all the introduced species have been able to establish
   populations and their impact on the indigenous populations is yet to be
   defined. A spectacular re-establishment of the carp population,
   following the crash of the stock of this species in the 1970s-1980s, was
   recorded in the spring of 1991. The past and present situation of the
   fisheries in lakes Mikri and Megali Prespa is described, and their
   productivity and yields are analysed. Particular attention is given to a
   traditional fishing method unique to the Prespa region: `'pelaizia''
   fishing. The factors involved in the temporal trends in the fisheries
   are identified and analysed. Recommendations for the management of the
   fish populations and the fisheries are proposed, so that the
   sustainability of this resource and the survival of the endemic fish
   species can be ensured.}},

Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{351}},
Pages = {{175-196}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{The present article describes the human activities in the area and their
   changes and trends, given that the contemporary nature conservation key
   issues are closely related to past and present socio-economic and
   cultural conditions, both within Prespa itself and outside of it. The
   liberation of Prespa, a remote and rather socially isolated borderline
   area, from Ottoman occupation took place in 1912-13. Recent events in
   its environmental history have been forest clearings and human
   depopulation in the Civil War (1944-49), irrigation system construction
   in the 1960s, its `discovery' by ornithologists in the late 1960s, the
   high emigration rates of 1960-1980, its designation as a National Park
   in 1974, the destructive development works of 1984-86 after Greece's
   entry to the EEC and the conversion to intensive bean cultivation in the
   mid 1980s.
   The human population of ca 7000 at the start of this century suffered an
   almost 80\% decrease after the Civil War. A resettlement in the mid
   1950s increased the population by 40\% but in the 1970s emigration
   reduced it to its previous size of around 1500, still its present size.
   The extensive and diverse farming systems of previous centuries changed
   gradually after the construction of an irrigation network in the 1960s,
   which twenty years later and along with international changes in
   production and economy patterns, made possible the present day
   domination of a bean monoculture within irrigated croplands. This was
   accompanied by increased energy inputs, mechanisation and the use of
   chemicals. Intensification of agriculture brought increased incomes
   which attracted also livestock keepers, resulting in a 56\% decrease in
   numbers of livestock in 1964-1993. Cattle are presently kept for meat
   production only. They graze on the mountains, and no longer in the
   meadows around the lakeshore. A local shorthorn breed accounting for
   93\% of all cattle in 1963 declined to less than 18\% in 1993. Fishing
   aimed mainly at carp and Prespa bleak, continues today as in the past to
   be a source of supplementary income. Eighty-six per cent of the mainly
   oak and beech-forests are State owned and the rest belong to local
   municipalities. The forest area has not changed essentially in the last
   40 years, but forest roads have expanded. Forests provide mainly
   fuelwood for local needs and small quantities of industrial timber. No
   specific management is conducted to safeguard the conservation values of
   the forest, the majority of which consists of even aged coppiced stands
   with limited value for wildlife. Manufacturing never played an important
   role for the economy of the area. Tourism has increased in the last 20
   years, concentrated mainly in summer and spring. Accommodation in the
   villages is not yet satisfactory though it has improved enormously in
   recent years. The National Park's infrastructure for visitors remains
   poor. Tourist pressure generally is not yet that high to impact
   drastically the social and environmental fabric. In places, hunting,
   angling and poaching cad negatively affect the target species. The
   construction of the irrigation network in the eastern part of Lake Mikri
   Prespa was the most important change to the landscape and the habitats
   of Prespa the last 30 years. It resulted in the embankment of
   free-flowing streams, drainage of wet meadows and dramatic reduction of
   trees and hedges. In the last 15 years, the reedbeds, no longer burnt ar
   mowed and assisted by increased nutrient loadings from agricultural
   runoff, have expanded landward to occupy formerly open, periodically
   flooded, areas. The above changes in habitats and land use have brought
   an impoverishment of biodiversity which can be seen in the extermination
   or the decrease in the numbers of certain plant and bird species.
   The problems preventing a better management of the National Park and the
   perpetuation of its values are inappropriate legislation, the poor
   degree of coordination of the public services, the lack of both a
   specific National Park Service in Greece and a management authority for
   the Park and the hostile attitude of local people due to their limited
   information and involvement. The scenic beauty, the wetlands and a
   number of rare habitats, the diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, the
   endemic life forms, the rare mammals and the colonial waterbirds, the
   local architecture and the cultural expressions such as the Byzantine
   monuments, are the values of Prespa that must be preserved as a whole.
   The initial conservation efforts aimed at preserving biodiversity but
   later it became apparent that not only are humans an inseparable part of
   the whole, but additionally, several of their extensive activities have
   contributed substantially to the rich biodiversity of the area. Through
   the prerequisites of keeping a balance between primary and tertiary
   sector activities and of revitalizing the social fabric, the following
   are the key management and conservation issues of today: an unequivocal
   agreement on the values to be preserved and their limits; the formation
   of a management authority; a new realistic protection and land use
   zoning; the diversification and extensification of all fanning
   activities; the restoration of the wet meadow habitats; the ensuring of
   a high water level and a good water quality for both lakes through
   tri-lateral cooperation between Greece, Albania and FYROM; and the
   establishment of a permanent environmental monitoring scheme.}},

Abstract = {{We studied terrestrial amphibian and small mammal assemblages with drift
   fences and pitfall traps in five forested stands during 1987-1988 on
   Shenandoah Mountain in the George Washington National Forest, Virginia,
   USA. Eleven species of salamanders, five frogs, five shrews, and seven
   rodents were monitored. Amphibians were significantly more abundant in
   forest stands consisting of mature hardwoods than in a recent clearcut
   and a white pine plantation, Although there was considerable variation
   in abundance among species in the five stands, small mammal abundance
   was high in all five habitats studied. Amphibian species diversity
   (Shannon Index) was less than half that for small mammals because
   red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) were dominant in most
   assemblages. Amphibian and small mammal diversity and total species
   richness were not related to estimated stand age, total number of canopy
   trees, tree diversity, or frequency of underground rocks, Maintenance of
   amphibian biodiversity requires the combination of mature hardwoods and
   wetland habitats (e.g. wildlife ponds and seepages). Most of the small
   mammals encountered were habitat generalists. Management focus on mature
   hardwood forests would maintain populations of small mammals requiring
   cool, moist situations in upper-elevation habitats in the central
   Appalachian Mountains. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were made of the accumulation of the heavy metals Ba, Cd, Co,
   Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn and the macroelements N, P, K, Ca,
   and Mg in liverworts Conocephalum conicum, Marchantia polymorphia, and
   Pellia epiphylla collected from 57 microhabitats in Poland (Lower
   Silesia, Tatry Mts., and Puszcza Augustowska forest) and one
   microhabitat in the Czech Republic (Moravsky Kras).
   Ecological differentiation of Conocephalum conicum, Marchantia
   polymorpha and Pellia epiphylla populations is closely correlated with
   the soil chemistry. The evidence for this assumption are the significant
   positive correlations between concentrations of elements in soil and in
   the examined liverworts. In particular, correlations between contents of
   chromium and cobalt in soil and in Conocephalum conicum and between
   nickel, chromium, copper, and barium in soil and in Pellia epiphylla
   prove that these plants can be useful in monitoring of contamination of
   soil with elements mentioned above. Concentrations of cobalt in almost
   all the examined liverworts surpass the average background values of
   this element established for terrestrial bryophytes what proves that
   these plants tolerate increased accumulated amounts of this element and
   may therefore act as bioindicator for this heavy metal.
   Cationic equilibrium of Conocephalum conicum, Marchantia polymorpha and
   Pellia epiphylla examined according to Czarnowski (1977) pointed to the
   existence of some disturbances in ionic balance of these plants caused
   probably by elevated concentrations of microelements (especially iron,
   cobalt, lead, and copper) in their tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of several trace elements were determined in mosses,
   higher plants and organs of small mammals from a geothermal area in
   Tuscany (central Italy). Increased deposition of Hg, As, B, and Sb was
   detected in biological samples collected within a few hundred meters of
   geothermal power plants. Among the species considered, the moss Hypnum
   cupressiforme was the most efficient accumulator of trace elements.
   Contamination levels in a fodder-plant (Hedysarum coronarium) and
   vegetables grown in the geothermal field did not seem to pose health
   risks for consumers. However, a statistically significant increase in
   Hg, B, and As concentrations was found in the kidney and muscle of small
   mammals living close to geothermal installations. Biological effects of
   B pollution were detected in two sensitive plant species.
   In view of plans to increase the exploitation of geothermal resources in
   the area, adequate measures to monitor the environment should be taken.
   Mosses are the most suitable accumulative biomonitors for a surveillance
   network, and studies on small mammal populations should be intensified.
   Available technologies should be used to diminish atmospheric emissions
   from geothermal power plants.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies often rely only on data from a single monitoring
   station at a study site. However, significant small-scale spatial
   gradients for air pollutants are inevitable and one monitoring station
   cannot be representative for the entire population living in the study
   region. Small- scale spatial gradients (horizontally and vertically) of
   particulate matter < 10 mu m (PM10) and NO2 were examined along a
   roadside in Zurich during the winter and summer seasons (1994-1995).
   Horizontal and vertical concentration gradients for PM10 were about 13\%
   (spatial coefficient of variation), and for NO2 about 15\%. For PM10,
   the effect of season on the horizontal and vertical gradient was small.
   For NO2, the small-scale spatial gradients were highly influenced by
   season: during the spring-summer season, spatial gradients were much
   greater than during the autumn-winter season. This implies that future
   monitoring programmes, should include more monitoring sites for PM10
   and, especially for NO2, the spring-summer season should include far
   more spatial resolution. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Long term changes in the size of populations of the tsetse Glossina
   pallidipes Austen and G. longipennis Corti were monitored over a 12 year
   period at Nguruman in south-western Kenya. Tsetse populations were
   subject to droughts of varying intensity and, from 1987, to trapping,
   initially by a research organization, and later by a community-based
   development project. Populations were mainly sampled using odour-baited
   biconical traps, with data from other monitoring traps corrected
   accordingly. Mark-release-recapture studies were carried out to relate
   trap catches to absolute population size, and to quantify movement
   between subpopulations. Trypanosomiasis incidence rates in a herd of
   local cattle were also monitored for much of this period. Trap catches
   were shown to be well correlated with estimates of absolute population
   size, with no evidence of any seasonal change in trap efficiency. The
   intensity of trapping and level of seasonal immigration appeared to be
   the main determinants of population trends, with effective control being
   achieved when traps were well maintained. Movement between the two
   lowland subpopulations was shown to be greater for females, and to be
   inversely related to temperature. An analytical model was used to
   investigate the responses of a partially isolated population to trapping
   pressure. Predictions of a deterministic simulation model demonstrated
   that the observed changes are consistent with an adult trapping
   mortality of 4-8\% per day, and immigration of 100,000 G. pallidipes
   females per month in the long rains (April and May), 5000 per month in
   the short rains (November), and about 500 per month during the dry
   seasons. Trypanosomiasis incidence in local cattle was greatly reduced
   during the period of community-based tsetse control. When tsetse were
   sampled exactly where the cattle were grazing, disease incidence was
   shown to be linearly related to G. pallidipes catches. Arguments for tr
   ap resistance and residual populations were examined, and found to be
   inconsistent with the data. The future for tsetse control by the
   Nguruman community is considered.}},

Abstract = {{An insecticide impregnated fabric (IIF) trap was developed at the Vector
   Control Research Centre, India. The mosquito sampling efficiency of this
   new trap, relative to hand catches of indoor resting mosquitoes, was
   evaluated in human dwellings and cattle sheds in a filariasis endemic
   area. The predominant species collected in human dwellings was Culex
   quinquefasciatus Say, a vector of bancroftian filariasis; whereas
   mosquitoes of the Culex vishnui group Theobald and Anopheles subpictus
   Grassi were caught in relatively greater numbers in cattle sheds. The
   numbers of mosquitoes in the trap were significantly correlated with the
   numbers caught in hand catches, and the numbers of mosquitoes collected
   per two traps per day in the three habitats during the study period were
   1.79, 0.95 and 2.27x those collected by hand-catches. The number of
   occasions on which mosquitoes were detected by both methods was
   comparable. There was no evidence for a systematic difference in the
   age-structure and parasite distribution between the two sampling
   methods, suggesting that the trap is able to monitor both insect vectors
   and parasite infections. Therefore, the calculation of infection and
   infectivity rates necessary to monitor filariasis transmission should be
   possible from the IIF trap in filariasis endemic areas where control
   measures are being taken.}},

   coexisting species affect parasitism rates in the endangered
   Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapillus). Black-capped Vireos and
   White-eyed Vireos (V. griseus) suffered three to four times higher
   cowbird parasitism than Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) or
   Painted Buntings (Passerina ciris). After controlling for removal of
   female cowbirds, which has been conducted on the study site since 1988,
   parasitism rates in Black-capped Vireos were positively correlated with
   cumulative host density in general, and Northern Cardinal density in
   particular. Only density of Northern Cardinals explained a significant
   amount of variation in parasitism rates in Black-capped Vireos among
   sites. We suggest that cowbirds may be attracted to conspicuous species,
   such as cardinals, and that high densities of such species may
   negatively affect coexisting species by increasing probabilities of
   being parasitized. Vireo nests were characterized by less nest
   concealment, greater canopy cover, and more stems than other species.
   However nest site and vegetation characteristics did not differ between
   parasitized and unparasitized nests for any species, suggesting habitat
   was unimportant to parasitism.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted at-sea line transect surveys for Marbled Murrelets
   (Brachyramphus marmoratus) to determine density off the coast of central
   California and to explore the utility of various survey protocols.
   Surveys were designed to compare line versus strip transect methods, and
   reveal the effects of distance from shore, viewing conditions and
   seasonal trends on density estimates. On consecutive days, we conducted
   12 paired (24 total) at-sea line and strip transect surveys that were 20
   km long at 400 m and 800 m from shore. We also performed nine surveys
   that were 10 km long and at distances of 400 m, 900 m, 1,400 m, 2,400 m,
   3,400 m and 4,400 m from shore. Density estimates calculated using line
   transects were significantly greater than estimates based on strip
   transects of 100 m and 200 m widths. Marbled Murrelet density ranged
   from 2.4-39.4 birds km(-2) at 400 m from shore, and from 0.0-16.5 birds
   km(-2) at 800 m from shore. Density was higher on the 400 m than on the
   800 m survey on 22 of 24 survey days. Densities measured on consecutive
   days were highly correlated on the 400 m transect but not on the 800 m
   transect. Line transect densities on the 400 m transect were higher when
   conducted under better viewing conditions. Line transects had higher
   statistical power to detect trends than strip transects. Statistical
   power analyses indicated only a 24\% chance of detecting a population
   declining by 5\% per year over 5 years when surveying line transects 20
   km in length five times a year. Power to detect a 5\% annual change
   increased to 57\% when surveying line transects five times per year over
   10 years. Survey design should strive to minimize variability in bird
   density in order to maximize likelihood of detecting population trends.
   An increase in the number of surveys per breeding season, length of a
   transect, or duration of monitoring effort should increase power to
   detect trends in murrelet density. We suggest that at-sea surveys should
   focus on detecting trends in density rather than population size.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the short term behavioral and demographic responses of
   gray-tailed voles (Microtus canicaudus) to the reduction and
   fragmentation of their habitat. Our objectives were (1) to test whether
   animals perished or moved into remaining fragments after 70\% of their
   habitat was removed; and (2) to test the null hypothesis that the social
   structure and demography of animals would not differ between habitats
   consisting of one large continuous fragment (625 m(2)), a mosaic of 25
   small fragments (each 25 m(2)) separated by 4 m of bare ground, and
   control, unmanipulated habitats (1850 m(2)). We conducted the experiment
   in 12, 0.2-ha enclosures planted with alfalfa with four replicates for
   each of two manipulated treatments and a control. A 70\% reduction in
   habitat did not adversely affect adult survival, reproductive rate,
   juvenile recruitment, or population size. However, an influx of
   unrelated females into habitat fragments resulted in decreased juvenile
   recruitment in those fragments. Voles from cleared habitat moved into
   the remaining habitat and did not measurably affect the resident
   population. Similarly, the demography of voles did no differ
   significantly among the large-fragment, small-fragment, and control
   enclosures. Peak density estimates based on the amount of habitat in
   each enclosure were 545 animals per hectare in control, 1056 in
   large-fragment, and 2880 in small-fragment enclosures. Reduced movement
   of animals among the small fragments was the most obvious effect of
   habitat fragmentation. Six percent of females and 15\% of males moved
   among small fragments within a week compared to approximately 60\%
   moving comparable distances in large-fragment and control enclosures.
   Rates of juvenile dispersal and sexual maturation declined throughout
   the summer on all treatments, were associated with season and density,
   and were only marginally associated with habitat loss and fragmentation.
   We conclude that at the time of habitat removal and fragmentation,
   populations were small enough to accommodate a 70\% reduction in habitat
   and still continue to increase in numbers. The social system of
   gray-tailed voles was sufficiently flexible to accommodate an influx of
   animals to withstand densities >1000 voles per ha. The behavioral and
   demographic features of gray-tailed voles are similar to those reported
   for other small mammals, thus confirming the use of voles for ecological
   model systems in habitat fragmentation studies.}},

Abstract = {{The disappearance and return of plethodontid salamanders on clearcuts
   has been monitored since 1979 in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains at
   three sites near Highlands, North Carolina. Salamander abundance on 225
   m(2) plots located on clearcuts and in nearby forest was determined by
   nightly non-destructive searches. Abundances on clearcut and forest
   plots at a given site were compared for each year in which sampling
   occurred. Numbers of salamanders on clearcut plots decreased to 30-50\%
   of forested plots in the first year after logging and were almost zero
   by the second year. Decreases in standing crop and moisture content of
   leaf litter seem responsible for salamander disappearance. Salamanders
   returned to clearcuts 4-6 years after cutting, and their numbers
   increased rapidly. Linear regressions estimate that salamander numbers
   on clearcut plots will equal or exceed numbers on forested plots by 2-24
   years after cutting. The pattern of salamander return to clearcuts
   appears closely correlated with the timing of litter layer reformation.
   All sex and age classes of the most common species, Plethodon jordani,
   disappear from clearcuts at equal rates, whereas the earliest colonizers
   are predominantly large adults. Plethodon oconaluftee, a
   desiccation-resistant species, exists on regenerating clearcuts in
   disproportionately large numbers. Large adults of all species, including
   Plethodon oconaluftee, may be better able to withstand the drier, sparse
   litter cove of young, regenerating stands. Adults might move to
   clearcuts to avoid competition from smaller and immature salamanders
   restricted to mature forests with abundant, moist liter.}},

Abstract = {{Land managers often suggest fencing to protect rare plant species from
   being trampled in heavily used recreation areas, but there are few
   documented examples of the efficacy of this strategy. In a 7-year
   demographic study we examined the reproduction, survival, and long-term
   viability of the endangered sentry milk-vetch (Astragalus cremnophylax
   var. cremnophylax) before and after protection from trampling.
   Demographic monitoring and population viability analyses indicated that
   the population has fluctuated during the 7 years. Before protection the
   population declined: 26\% of individuals died, mortality surpassed
   natality, and age of first reproduction was significantly older than
   post-protection. Fifty-eight percent of the population was severely
   damaged. Population viability analyses of pre-protection years predicted
   that the population would go extinct within 100 years. Since protection,
   the population stabilized, grew, and declined again. Seedlings reached
   reproductive maturity more quickly. Recruitment increased and peaked in
   1993 coincident with abundant precipitation, but again declined in 1994.
   The total numbers of undamaged plants surpassed the numbers of damaged
   plants. Models of the post-protection population predict stability.
   Multiple-linear regression analysis indicated that winter and spring
   precipitation were significantly correlated with lambda. Both `'good''
   and `'bad'' climatic conditions occurred during the pre- and
   post-protection periods. Because of small population size and
   depauperate genetic diversity, climate will continue to influence
   population growth. Nevertheless, models indicate that where trampling
   and bad climatic conditions were coupled, extinction was accelerated.
   Recovery of sentry milk-vetch will depend on continued protection,
   augmentation, and environmental factors, although risk of extinction
   remains very high.}},

Abstract = {{We measured body temperatures of free-ranging Brisbane River Turtles,
   Emydura signata with radiotelemetry. These and other species of
   freshwater turtle are commonly observed `'basking'' on logs or other
   elevated sites, a behavior which is usually interpreted as
   thermoregulatory. However, body temperatures of eight E. signata
   monitored for more than 112 turtle days in winter, spring, and summer
   showed a striking thermoconformity with the water and provided no data
   showing that this species routinely elevates its body temperature above
   water temperature. The biological, significance of basking: is obscure
   in this population of E. signata, and the study highlights the need for
   direct measurements of body temperature in free-ranging individuals of

   vary regionally. Coastal wetlands in the southeastern United States have
   naturally evolved under a regime of rising sea level and specific
   patterns of hurricane frequency, intensity, and timing. A review of
   known ecological effects of tropical storms and hurricanes indicates
   that storm timing, frequency, and intensity can alter coastal wetland
   hydrology, geomorphology, biotic structure, energetics, and nutrient
   cycling. Research conducted to examine the impacts of Hurricane Hugo on
   colonial waterbirds highlights the importance of longterm studies for
   identifying complex interactions that may otherwise be dismissed as
   stochastic processes.
   Rising sea level and even modest changes in the frequency, intensity,
   timing, and distribution of tropical storms and hurricanes are expected
   to have substantial impacts on coastal wetland patterns and processes.
   Persistence of coastal wetlands will be determined by the interactions
   of climate and anthropogenic effects, especially how humans respond to
   rising sea level and how further human encroachment on coastal wetlands
   affects resource exploitation, pollution, and water use. Long-term
   changes in the frequency, intensity, timing, and distribution of
   hurricanes and tropical storms will likely affect biotic functions
   (e.g., community structure, natural selection, extinction rates, and
   biodiversity) as well as underlying processes such as nutrient cycling
   and primary and secondary productivity.
   Reliable predictions of global-change impacts on coastal wetlands will
   require better understanding of the linkages among terrestrial, aquatic,
   wetland, atmospheric, oceanic, and human components. Developing this
   comprehensive understanding of the ecological ramifications of global
   change will necessitate close coordination among scientists from
   multiple disciplines and a balanced mixture of appropriate scientific
   approaches. For example, insights may be gained through the careful
   design and implementation of broad-scale comparative studies that
   incorporate salient patterns and processes, including treatment of
   anthropogenic influences. Well-designed, broad-scale comparative studies
   could serve as the scientific framework for developing relevant and
   focused long-term ecological research, monitoring programs, experiments,
   and modeling studies. Two conceptual models of broad-scale comparative
   research for assessing ecological responses to climate change are
   presented: utilizing space-for-time substitution coupled with long-term
   studies to assess impacts of rising sea level and disturbance on coastal
   wetlands, and utilizing the moisture-continuum model for assessing the
   effects of global change and associated shifts in moisture regimes on
   wetland ecosystems. Increased understanding of climate change will
   require concerted scientific efforts aimed at facilitating
   interdisciplinary research, enhancing data and information management,
   and developing new funding strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The population sizes of 10 sympatric grasshopper species in an example
   grassland biotope were quantitatively determined using their
   species-specific song patterns. The numbers of singing males, the
   diurnal song activity, the song quality, the audible distance for the
   different species, and their sex proportion provided the basis for the
   calculation of grasshopper numbers. By this, densities and species
   compositions could be estimated simultaneously. The calculated numbers
   were strongly supported by the results of direct catches in small areas.
   For assessment of the quality of biotopes and their sub-biotopes, the
   numerical proportion between euryoecious and xerophilic grasshoppers
   (independent of the species) was calculated and proved to be an
   excellent parameter. This provided a rapid, well-reproducible, and
   detailed method to measure the eutrophication of grassland habitats.
   With this method, we could also quantitatively assess the effects of
   protective measures.}},

Abstract = {{Restrictions on the release of PCBs into the environment began in the
   early 1970s, resulting in reduced PCB concentrations in Lake Michigan
   bloaters (Coregonus hoyi). However, since 1980, PCB concentrations in
   bloater have declined only slightly. The bloater population also
   increased 40-fold during 1970 through 1984, resulting in a diet shift
   and a density-dependent decline in growth. Our goal was to determine how
   these changes in diet and growth may have affected PCB accumulation in
   Lake Michigan bloater. We evaluated the consequences of these two
   changes on bloater PCB concentrations by developing a
   bioenergetics-based PCB bioaccumulation model. Bloater PCB
   concentrations increased little when we increased the amount of Diporeia
   hoyi, the most contaminated prey, in the bloater diet. By comparing
   constant growth (similar to those of the 1970s) to observed decline in
   growth rates, we found that lower growth rates during the 1980s placed
   older, more contaminated bloaters in the size range most vulnerable to
   predators and in the size range sampled by PCB monitoring programs.
   Bloater PCB concentration trends may be influenced by the sampling
   methodology of the United States Geological Survey. If fish PCB trends
   are to be used as an indicator of system-level PCB trends, sampling
   should include a representative sample of fish of known age from the
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of life-history traits and the effects of density
   upon them were studied in an island population of the lizard Eumeces
   okadae. Although life-history traits such as clutch size, egg size and
   the proportion of mature reproductive females varied little over 7 years
   in the intact population, manipulation of density to simulate decreased
   population density enhanced juvenile growth rate, age at first
   reproduction, frequency of female reproduction and size-specific clutch
   mass. In particular, the proportion of mature females reproducing
   annually increased almost 10 times from 5.6\% to 53.8\% after the
   removal of some lizards. However, body size at first reproduction and
   egg size were almost identical under both high and low density
   conditions. This study suggests that there were strong density-dependent
   effects on several life-history traits and that E. okadae attained a
   density close to the carrying capacity of the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses of 4 species of natural enemies to 4 colors were
   examined by capturing adults on colored sticky cards placed at 2
   locations (edge and interior) in corn, Zea mays L., fields. Cards were
   placed at 2 heights (1.8 and 0.3 m) in 1993 and in 2 habitats (sweet and
   field corn) in 1994, using a split-split plot design. Natural enemies
   studied included the coccinellids Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) and
   Coccinella septempunctata L., the chrysopid Chrysoperla carnea
   (Stephens), and Macrocentrus grandii Goidanich, a braconid larval
   parasitoid of Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner). Compared with red, green, and
   white cards, yellow cards trapped greater numbers of all natural
   enemies, except C. carnea, which was trapped equally on cards of all 4
   colors. Few significant interactions were observed between the effects
   of color and those of location and height or habitat, which are perhaps
   indicative of microhabitat preferences. Captures on cards provided
   information on abundance of each natural enemy species during different
   periods in the summer. It also revealed the pattern of adult flights of
   M. grandii, which is useful for determining whether its life cycle is
   synchronized with that of its host. The study suggests that, besides
   studying behavioral responses, color cards may be useful for monitoring
   natural enemy populations.}},

Abstract = {{An ambient particle monitoring study was conducted in Washington, D.C.
   during the summer of 1994 as part of the Metropolitan Acid Aerosol
   Characterization Study (MAACS). Acid aerosol and inhalable (particulate
   matter with aerodynamic diameters <10 mu m; PM2.5) particle samples were
   collected for 24-hr periods (9 A.M.-9 A.M. EDT) on alternate days at six
   monitoring sites located throughout the greater Washington, D.C. area.
   Monitoring sites were located in both urban and rural areas and were
   generally situated along a southwest to northeast line due to the
   prevailing winds. Information on site characteristics, including
   population density and distance from the city center, was also obtained,
   as were data on meteorological parameters. Results from this study show
   strong correlations among the particulate measures, PM10, PM2.5, SO42,
   and H+. These strong correlations resulted from the fact that PM2.5
   comprised 77\% of PM10, with SO42--related species accounting for 49\%
   of total PM2.5. PM10, PM2.5, SO42, and H+ concentrations were found to
   be uniform across the metropolitan Washington area. Spatial variation
   was found, however, for coarse particles (PM2.5-10) and NH3
   concentrations. In our previous Philadelphia study, population density
   was an important determinant of spatial variation in coarse particles
   and NH3 concentrations. When data from one site (Reservoir), was
   excluded from the analysis, population density explained a larger
   percentage of the variability in NH3 levels and became an important
   determinant of the H+/SO42- ratio as well. Ambient H+ models developed
   from Philadelphia data were found to predict H+ concentration in
   Washington, D.C., reasonably well, representing an improvement over
   measurements made at a single stationary ambient monitoring site.}},

Abstract = {{McMurdo Station is the largest research station in Antarctica and has a
   population that ranges from 250 to 1200 people. Wastewater from the
   Station is macerated, was sometimes mixed with waste brine from the
   desalinization plant and is discharged to McMurdo Sound. Effluent water
   quality has been routinely monitored since 1989, and a special ambient
   water quality study was conducted by Idaho National Engineering
   Laboratory (INEL) personnel in 1992. Results of the effluent monitoring
   efforts show that low concentrations of a few organic contaminants have
   been detected, while concentrations of metals, particularly copper, are
   considerably higher. Ambient water quality and sea ice monitoring
   detected very few contaminants, all at very low levels. Only minor and
   variable dissolved oxygen depression was detected near the outfall.
   Diatom communities near the outfall differ in relative abundance, cell
   counts, and chlorophyll a content compared to control sites. For the
   purpose of evaluating the impact of McMurdo's effluent on ambient water
   quality, improved effluent monitoring and sediment quality monitoring
   are recommended instead of frequent monitoring of ambient water quality.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to maintain small populations in quasi-natural settings is
   an issue of considerable importance in biodiversity conservation. The
   genetic structure of urban common frog (Rana temporaria) populations was
   determined by allozyme electrophoresis and used to evaluate the effects
   of restricted intersite migration. Despite the lack of any absolute
   barrier to movement between ponds, substantial genetic differentiation
   was found between sites separated by an average of only 2.3 km. Genetic
   distances between these town ponds correlated positively with
   geographical distances and were almost twice as great as those found
   between rural sites separated by an average of 41 km. Measures of
   genetic diversity and fitness were always lowest in the town, where the
   degree of subpopulation differentiation (F-ST = 0.388) was high.
   Population decline was not evident in the town, but molecular and
   fitness data indicated the presence of genetic drift and inbreeding
   depression. The long-term survival of artificially restricted
   populations, particularly of relatively sedentary species, may require
   molecular monitoring, if genetic diversity is not to be lost by chance
   when facets of the species niche prove to be poorly understood.}},

Abstract = {{1. Beavers create habitat diversity across catchment landscapes by
   impounding small streams. This increased habitat diversity leads to
   increased species richness of plants and animals in small streams. As
   managers work to balance conflicting management goals (e.g. protection
   of timber and human structures versus maintenance of biological
   diversity) the influence of beaver population management practices on
   habitat availability needs to be assessed. Two questions of initial
   concern are: (i) how do different levels of management influence the
   availability of beaver created habitats and (ii) do relationships
   developed in one region apply to other regions?
   2. To address these questions, historical aerial photography was used to
   determine the extent and rate of impoundment of streams by beavers
   Castor canadensis over a 77 000 ha south-eastern North American
   landscape during a 40-year period of beaver population recovery. Between
   1950 and 1983, beaver populations were protected from trapping and
   hunting. From 1983 to the present, beaver numbers were reduced by fatal
   trapping, to protect roads, railroads and timber. Trapped beavers were
   assigned to specific colonies associated with beaver-created patches in
   the landscape, and growth rates and size after management of individual
   patches receiving different levels of management were compared. Results
   from this study were also compared with previous studies conducted in
   Minnesota, USA.
   3, Growth rate, patch size following management and the composition of
   habitat types within patches were not related to management activity,
   suggesting that the levels of management used in this study did not
   influence the temporal dynamics of beaver-created patches. The extent
   and rate of beaver impoundment on the southeastern Upper Coastal Plain
   of North America was less than that reported from central North American
   landscapes over comparable periods.
   4, These results have the following implications for management: (i)
   management activities should be monitored on a regional basis; (ii)
   conflicting beaver population management goals should be addressed,
   evaluated and balanced; and (iii) beavers do not present a threat to
   flowing-water species in south-eastern North America and need not be
   controlled for this reason.}},

Abstract = {{1 The responses of populations of Mertensia paniculata (bluebells or
   lungwort) and Anemone parviflora (small-flowered anemone) to herbivore
   exclosure and fertilization in a factorial experiment were monitored
   over a 5-year period beginning at peak herbivore (hare) densities during
   the snowshoe hare population cycle. For each species the population
   density, number and size of leaves and the number of flowers were
   measured.
   2 Both species responded more strongly to fertilizer addition than to
   the exclusion of herbivores. Mertensia produced more flowering stems,
   more leaves per stem, and stem density increased in the fertilized
   plots. Fertilizing increased total leaf length per plant for
   non-flowering stems but this was not observed for flowering stems.
   However, the net effect of having more flowering stems and having
   greater leaf area on nonflowering stems was to increase the total leaf
   area of the population. The responses of Mertensia make it likely to
   become a stronger competitor in a more productive plant community.
   3 Anemone showed contrasting responses at both individual and population
   levels. While individual stems produced slightly more leaves in
   fertilized plots, the density of stems declined. There were no strong
   effects on either leaf size or flowering. There was evidence of higher
   leaf turnover in fertilized plants. Meanwhile, control and exclosed
   unfertilized plots showed an increase in population density.
   4 The weak responses to herbivory may be explained by the timing; this
   part of the experiment was run during a period of declining herbivore
   activity. However, observed interaction effects suggest that those
   herbivores remaining ill the system may be attracted to fertilized
   plots. It is planned to continue the experiment for at least another 5
   years through, and beyond, the next hare peak.}},

Abstract = {{In field studies, sticky traps and vacuum cleaners were evaluated to
   determine their effectiveness in the control of German cockroaches,
   Blattella germanica (L.), infesting multifamily housing. Trapping and
   vacuuming treatments were compared with insecticide baiting and residual
   spraying methods. At 4-wk posttreatment in 1995 tests, the percentage of
   cumulative population reductions caused by Siege gel bait, Victor Roach
   Pheromone sticky traps, flushing and vacuuming, vacuuming, and Empire
   spray treatments reached 82.4, 79.3, 80.2, 72.5, and 72.0\%,
   respectively. There were no significant differences in cockroach catch
   between treatments at all sampling periods after treatment, indicating
   that the treatments were equally effective in controlling B. germanica
   infestations. At 8 wk ; after treatment in 1996 tests, the percentage of
   cumulative population reductions caused by Knockdown Pheromone Boric
   Acid bait, Victor Roach Pheromone sticky traps, and Suspend spray
   treatments reached 83.7, 80.1, and 68.5\%, respectively As in 1995
   tests, there were no significant differences in cockroach catch between
   treatments at all sampling periods after treatment. Trapping with sticky
   traps and the use of the vacuuming technique led to significant
   reductions in trap catch at all sampling times after treatments. In
   total, 7,543 cockroaches were caught on Victor Roach Pheromone traps
   removed from 11 apartments during the 4-wk test period in 1995. In
   total, 3,554 cockroaches were caught on Victor Roach Pheromone traps
   removed from 5 apartments during the 8-wk test period in 1996. The use
   of the flushing agent before vacuuming led to a greater population
   reduction and removal of hard-to-reach gravid females. Sticky traps and
   vacuum cleaners also were effective as monitoring devices and provided
   acceptable control for B. germanica.}},

Abstract = {{Automated acoustic detection systems count the insects in a grain sample
   by analyzing the spatial and temporal distribution of sounds. The
   acoustic location fixing insect detector is an automated system
   developed originally to quantify hidden lan nl infestations in l-kg
   samples of wheat. The detector analyzes input from an array of sensors
   embedded in the sample container walls. It identifies (scores) a
   specific pattern of input as an insect if the spatial and temporal
   distribution matches the criteria based on a calibration with 4th-instar
   rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L). However, expanded testing has
   revealed considerable differences in the spatial and temporal
   distributions of sounds made by insects of different species and sizes.
   These differences were examined in a series of tests with insects that
   range an order of magnitude above and below the 1.5-mg weight of the S.
   oryzae larvae. A particular focus was the detection order of the first 2
   sensors registering each sound. Multiple sounds from an insect tend to
   cluster together into a small number of contiguous Ist :end sensor
   detection pairs, but the pattern for background noises is random. It was
   determined that the cluster size, the number of contiguous Ist:2nd
   detection pairs, was proportional to insect weight. The rate of sound
   detection was inversely proportional to weight. Thus, to reliably count
   insects with widely varying sound production patterns, the sound pattern
   identification algorithm needs to self correct, depending on the input
   received from the grain sample. Adults or larvae generating large
   numbers of loud sounds, typically weighing >1 mg, can be scored in a few
   seconds, but those generating small numbers of weak sounds, typically <1
   mg, should be monitored for periods >10 min. The possibility of using
   differences in cluster size to distinguish among species is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biologies of the black-crowned night-heron (Nycticorax
   nycticorax) and the little egret (Egretta garzetta) were studied in the
   mixed heron breeding colony at the Huleh Nature Reserve, Israel, from
   1977 to 1980. Both studied species have resident (30\%) and migrating
   populations. The colony consisted of about 3,000 pairs of seven breeding
   species nesting in 5-7 highly synchronous mixed species sub-colonies
   from mid-March to mid-September. Mean time-lapse between initiation of
   two sub-colonies is 20.45 days. Mean duration of egg-laying within a
   sub-colony is 12.45 days and of hatching is 12.38 days. Nests are built
   each year mainly with papyrus stems and there are significant
   differences among little egrets, night-herons and cattle egrets in their
   tendency to use different nesting material. Mean clutch size was 3.41
   for little egrets and 2.97 for night-herons, while the most frequent
   clutch size was three in both species (54.9\% and 68.5\%, respectively).
   Mean fresh laid egg masses were 27.15 g and 31.33 g for little egrets
   and night-herons, respectively. The variability in egg mass within a
   clutch was significantly smaller (on average 12 times and 7 times for
   little egrets and night-herons, respectively) than between clutches.
   Incubation of each egg lasts 21.6 days in little egrets and 21.1 days in
   night-herons. Mean egg mass loss during incubation was 14.6\% and 13.8\%
   for little egrets and night-herons, respectively. Hatching success is
   90.2\% (n = 177) in little egrets and 92.4\% (n = 258) in night-herons,
   and hatching order is related to laying order in both species.
   Hatchling's mass at hatch ranged from 13-26 g (n = 34), 74.8\% of
   initial egg mass for little egrets and 19-29 g (n = 30), 73.8\% of
   initial egg mass for night-herons. Chick development rates were studied
   in nature and in captivity. In both species there is a linear
   correlation between a chick's age and its body dimensions. Chicks reach
   adult dimensions at about one month and fledge at the age of 35-42 days.
   Fledged chicks disperse during the first year up to 50-60 km from the
   colony. Survival rates for chicks up to the age of 28 days are 69.9\%
   and 56.6\% for little egrets and night-herons, respectively. The main
   mortality factor for eggs and chicks is probably predation by avian
   predators. Data on minimum longevity, 10-11 years for Little egrets and
   7-8 years for night-herons, were obtained from resightings of tag-marked
   individuals. Long-term monitoring and study of the structure and
   breeding parameters of a regionally important colony in relation to
   known environmental effects are an essential tool for conservation and
   management plans for colonial species.}},

Title = {{Limiting factors might obscure population regulation of moose (Cervidae:
   Alces alces) in unproductive boreal forests}},

Abstract = {{(1) In the core of the moose range in North America, moose numbers are
   regulated at a low equilibrium density (approximate to 0.4 animal x
   km(-2)) by predation when wolves coexist with a bear species. We
   hypothesized that top-down dominance of moose could also occur further
   north in undisturbed boreal forest where densities generally reach less
   than 0.1 moose x km(-2).
   (2) Summer forage production (leaves of shrubs and trees) averaged only
   17 kg x ha(-1) in our 3090 km(2) study area, whereas it ranged between
   144 and 241 kg x ha(-1) in the core of moose range in the
   Quebec-Labrador peninsula. Annual production of preferred winter forage
   (twigs of deciduous shrubs and trees) was also very low in the study
   area, contrary to that of the evergreen balsam fir, whose availability
   was comparable to that measured in southern ranges.
   (3) Low forage production in the study area was due to a high proportion
   of outcrops (17\%) and open black spruce stands (20\%), and to the old
   age of most forest stands.
   (4) Forage had a patchy distribution: production of leaves in the most
   productive habitat type, deciduous stands, exceeded by 22 times that
   measured in the coniferous stands. Forage distribution influenced
   habitat use by moose, which generally showed year-round preferences for
   forage-rich mixed and deciduous stands and resulted in large home
   ranges.
   (5) Balsam fir dominated moose diets in late winter, whereas this plant
   species represented only 17-19\% of forage consumed further south in the
   moose range. We hypothesized that heavy consumption of balsam iir
   negatively affected the energy balance of moose in winter.
   (6) Monitored females produced only 78 calves: 100 cows, during three
   consecutive years. This relatively low rate of calf production could be
   related to suboptimal nutrition in winter and in summer. We found a
   significant relationship between snow depth, summer temperature, and
   lactation rare, an index to cow:calf ratios in autumn. Lactation rate
   was more strongly related to weather of the preceding year than that of
   the current one, suggesting that weather had an immediate influence on
   body reserves of dams, but little impact on calf production until the
   next year.
   (7) Calves experienced high survival, particularly during their first
   summer of life (90\%), in contrast with southern moose populations
   exposed to higher predation pressure. Annual survival of adult females
   (87\%) exceeded that of males (74\%) because the latter were more
   vulnerable to hunting. Natural mortality was similar in both sexes,
   8-10\%. In adults, predation may have been lighter, and other natural
   mortality causes higher in the study area than in the core of the moose
   range.
   (8) Limiting factors, i.e. climate, drowning, played a greater role in
   the demography of the study moose population than predation, the
   suspected regulating factor. Our data set illustrates that regulation
   may be difficult to detect in unproductive environments, a common
   situation at the periphery of any species distribution.}},

Abstract = {{From September to November 1991, UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino
   acids (MAAs) were monitored in a natural population of the sea urchin
   Sterechinus neumayeri from a coastal area of Anvers Island (Antarctic
   Peninsula). MAA concentrations were determined for specific tissues
   (gonad, digestive tract and body wall) from adults collected at four
   depths (intertidal, 8, 15 and 24 m). Four MAAs were identified:
   mycosporine-glycine, shinorine, porphyra-334 and palythine.
   Concentrations of MAAs among replicate individuals varied considerably.
   Ovaries had high concentrations of MAAs (84 to 1389 mu g g(-1) dry wt),
   while testes had non-detectable levels. The relative abundance of
   specific MAAs in ovaries appeared to be related to the spawning cycle.
   Digestive-tract samples had MAA concentrations as high as 3000 mu g
   g(-1) dry wt, but the mean MAA content in intertidal individuals
   decreased by 70\% over 3 mo during spring. The body walls of sea urchins
   had very low amounts of MAAs (less than or equal to 0.08 mu g g(-1) dry
   wt). There were significant depth differences in the total MAA content
   of the ovary (p <0.001), (p < 0.015), digestive tract (p < 0.001), and
   body wall with organisms from the intertidal and 8 m depth having the
   highest concentrations of MAAs. Biological dosimetry indicated that UV-B
   (280 to 320 nm) wavelengths penetrated 3 to 7 m below the sea ice during
   the study period. The total MAA content in ovaries decreased with depth
   on all sample dates; however, the MAA content of the digestive tract and
   body wall did not exhibit a consistent pattern of change with depth. The
   MAA content of tissues did not change significantly with the temporal
   gradient of light exposure that was established by both ozone depletion
   and increasing photoperiod, except in the digestive tract sampled from
   intertidal specimens. Adult urchins are probably well-protected from UV
   exposure by the water column and a calcareous test; however, the results
   of this study suggest that, even under ice cover, depth of habitation is
   a determinant of MAA content in S. neumayeri. Large daily and seasonal
   fluctuations in the light regime, which are characteristic of Antarctic
   coastal environments, apparently do not provide reliable cues to elicit
   a detectable, temporal, biochemical response.}},

   pine (Pinus ponderosa) grown in different substrates}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to ozone (O-3) has been shown to decrease the allocation of
   carbon to tree roots. Decreased allocation of carbon to roots might
   disrupt root metabolism and rhizosphere organisms. The effects of soil
   type and shoot O-3, exposure on below-ground respiration and soil
   microbial populations were investigated using container-grown ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) growing in a low-nutrient soil, or a
   fertilizer-amended organic potting media, and exposed to one of three
   levels of O-3 for two growing seasons in open-top exposure chambers. a
   closed system, designed to measure below-ground respiratory activity
   (CO2 production, O-2 consumption and RQ-Respiration Quotient; (CO2:O-2)
   of plants growing in pots, was used monthly to monitor below-ground
   respiration of 3-yr-old ponderosa pine.
   Although seasonal differences were detected, CO2 production (mu mol
   h(-1) g(-1) total root d. wt), O-2 consumption (mu mol h(-1) g(-1) total
   root d. wt) and RQ (CO2:O-2) increased with increasing O-3 exposure
   level. Seasonal patterns showed increased respiration rates during
   periods of rapid root growth in spring and early fall. Respiration
   quotient tended to decrease during known periods of active root growth
   in control seedlings, but a similar response was not observed in
   O-3-treated seedlings. Responses to O-3 were greatest in the soil-grown
   plants, which had a lower fertility level than media-grown plants.
   Although root d. wt was decreased, root:shoot ratios did not change in
   response to O-3. Soil-grown plants had higher root-shoot ratios than
   media-grown plants, reflecting the lower fertility of the soil.
   Plant exposure to O-3 was found to affect both active and total
   populations of soil organisms. In both organic potting media and in
   soil, biomass of active soil fungi, and the ratio of active-fungal to
   active-bacterial biomass increased with increasing plant exposure to
   O-3. The effect of O-3 on total fungal and bacterial biomass was not
   linear: at low O-3 levels, total fungal and bacterial biomass increased;
   at the high O-3 level, total fungal and bacterial biomass decreased
   compared with those of controls.
   Our results show that O-3 exposure to shoots significantly disrupts CO2
   production and O-2 consumption of soil and roots of ponderosa pine
   seedlings. Below-ground respiratory differences were thought to be a
   result of changes in respiratory substrates, carbon refixation within
   the plant and soil microbial activity. Ozone also changes belowground
   RQ, suggesting that O-3 substantially disrupts root metabolism and
   interactions with rhizosphere organisms. Ozone exposure of ponderosa
   pine grown in different soil types can disrupt below-ground respiration
   and influence populations of soil organisms without alteration of
   biomass partitioning between above-and belowground plant components.
   Collectively, the effect of O-3 on the below-ground system is of concern
   since it is likely that these changes are accompanied by a change in the
   ability of root systems to acquire nutrient and water resources and
   possibly to synthesize amino acids and proteins necessary for normal
   plant function.}},

Abstract = {{Increased activity of antioxidant defense enzymes, such as glutathione
   reductase (GR), is one mechanism employed by plants to prevent oxidative
   damage during low-temperature stress. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta
   Dougl.) was chosen to test the hypotheses that 1) enhanced GR activity
   would accompany cold acclimation and 2) montane populations (P. contorta
   var. latifolia) would have a higher level of GR activity than coastal
   populations (P. contorta var. contorta). Seasonal changes in specific
   activity of GR in needles of P. contorta were monitored in montane and
   coastal populations. Greenhouse and growth chamber experiments were
   performed to investigate the effect of temperature on GR activity and
   total glutathione content. Glutathione content and specific activity of
   GR were consistently higher in the montane site than in the coastal site
   during the winter. GR activity peaked at the onset of freezing low
   temperatures in the montane population but soon decreased again despite
   the persistence of freezing temperatures. Seedlings exposed to low
   temperatures in a growth chamber had higher levels of GR activity than
   did comparable seedlings maintained under higher temperatures, however,
   total glutathione was similar for both treatments. These data suggest
   that GR and glutathione may play a central role in cold acclimation
   especially during early phases and that these factors account in part
   for the considerable cold tolerance of lodgepole pine.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-yr field study was conducted to determine the effects of three
   soil-applied insecticides on northern corn rootworm (Diabrotica barberi)
   populations. In each plot, an emergence cage was placed over a corn (Zea
   mays) plant, and adult populations were monitored weekly. Larval damage
   to corn roots was evaluated and corn yield was recorded at the end of
   the growing season. Insecticide treatments significantly reduced the
   number of emerging adults in the first yr, but no difference was
   observed in the following yr. Root strength was negatively correlated to
   the number of emerging adults per plant. Each yr, corn yields in treated
   plots did not differ significantly from yield in untreated plots, which
   suggests that insecticide treatments can reduce the number of emerging
   adults without increasing yields.}},

Abstract = {{The potential impact of three widely used herbicides, pendimethalin,
   prometryn, and trifluralin, on populations of five plant disease
   suppressing bacterial isolates (three isolates of Pseudomonas
   fluorescens and two isolates of Burkholderia cepacia) in the rhizosphere
   of cotton seedlings was investigated. All isolates are efficient cotton
   root colonizers and each is capable of suppressing a plant disease. In
   microcosm experiments, application of each of the test herbicides at the
   rates of 1, 2, and 4 mu g active ingredient (a.i.) g(-1) soil caused
   significant (p<0.05) reductions in populations of most of the isolates
   in the rhizosphere, 14 days after the release of bacteria into the soil
   by seed coating. The responses of the isolates to the herbicides varied
   depending on the isolate and the type and concentration of the
   herbicides. In microcosm experiments the impact of pendimethalin,
   prometryn, and trifluralin at the respective concentrations of 2.4, 3.6,
   and 1.8 mu g a.i. g(-1) soil on the population of isolate D1 in the
   cotton rhizosphere declined with time during a four week period of
   monitoring following the release of the isolate into the soil by seed
   coating. The impact of soil applied test herbicides on the population
   sizes of D1 in cotton rhizosphere was also studied in two field
   experiments (Safford and Tucson, Arizona) where the bacteria were added
   as a soil drench. In the Safford experiment pendimethalin and prometryn,
   but not trifluralin, caused significant (p<0.05) reductions in the
   population of the bacterium 15 days after sowing. In the Tucson
   experiment a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the population of the
   bacterium was observed 15 and 25 days after sowing in soils treated with
   pendimethalin and prometryn and 25 days after sowing in soils treated
   with trifluralin.}},

Abstract = {{The study of chemical ecology, particularly involving pheromones and
   other semiochemicals that influence insect behaviour, promises methods
   of pest control as alternatives to the exclusive use of broad-spectrum
   toxicants. However, if the potential of semiochemicals in crop
   protection is to be realised, a greater understanding of insect/insect
   and insect/plant interactions, and insect chemical ecology generally, is
   essential. Semiochemicals, when employed alone, often give ineffective
   or insufficiently robust pest control. Use of semiochemicals should
   therefore be combined with other approaches in integrated management
   strategies. The main components of such strategies are pest monitoring,
   to allow accurate timing of pesticide treatments; combined use of
   semiochemicals, host plant resistance and trap crops, to manipulate pest
   behaviour; selective insecticides or biological control agents, to
   reduce pest populations. The objective is to draw together these
   approaches into a push-pull or stimulo-deterrent diversionary strategy
   (SDDS). In an SDDS, the harvestable crop is protected by host-masking
   agents, repellents, antifeedants or oviposition deterrents. At the same
   time, aggregative semiochemicals, including host plant attractants and
   sex pheromones, stimulate colonisation of pests on trap crops or entry
   into traps where pathogens can be deployed. Because the individual
   components of the SDDS are not in themselves highly efficient, they do
   not select for resistance as strongly as conventional toxicant
   pesticides, thereby making the SDDS intrinsically more sustainable. (C)

Abstract = {{Erigeron kachinensis is a rare endemic of the Colorado Plateau regions
   of southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado. It occurs in small,
   isolated alcoves (recessed areas in canyon walls) at seeps arising along
   canyon walls in sandstone substrates. One hundred randomly selected
   individuals of E. kachinensis within each of six alcoves in Natural
   Bridges National Monument, San Juan County, Utah, were monitored for 5
   yr (1990-1994). Survival of the 600 individuals was followed over the
   monitoring interval. Vegetative and reproductive parameters were
   assessed for the survivors each year. Mortality varied among the study
   alcoves and individual size-classes. Mortality was heavily concentrated
   in the smaller size-classes. Growth rate accelerated with increasing
   size-class. Survival rate also increased with increasing size-class.
   Plants are long-lived; however, longevity is still unknown since
   mortality was not observed in the largest size-class. Fecundity was
   greatest for the largest size-classes, yet over 80\% of the annual seed
   production came from the three smallest size-classes due to abundance of
   individuals in these size-classes. Populations varied with respect to
   plant size and resistance to environmental stressors. Matrix analysis
   demonstrated a finite rate of population growth of 0.75. However,
   observed size-class distributions of the six study populations over 5 yr
   of observation have never been stable. Maintenance of viable populations
   of the Kachina daisy is dependent on management actions that minimize
   disturbances (natural or anthropogenic) in the fragile hanging gardens
   that support the species.}},

Abstract = {{Records of amphibians and reptiles from the island region of western
   Lake Erie (Essex County, Ontario; Erie and Ottawa counties, Ohio) span
   more than a century and include 50 species, 35 of which have been
   recorded from at least one of 19 islands. Local colonization events,
   transient species, population declines and local extirpations occurring
   within this century are evident from these records. Furthermore, these
   records provide a baseline for monitoring future changes in
   distribution. Unusual components of the Lake Erie amphibian and reptile
   fauna include unisexual, polyploid and hybrid ambystomatid salamanders;
   a population of redback salamanders (Plethodon. cinereus) consisting
   almost entirely of lead-back morphs; populations of Lake Erie water
   snakes (Nerodia sipedon insularum) that are highly variable in color
   pattern and provide an exceptionally clear example of the effects of
   natural selection and gene flow and populations of common garter snakes
   (Thamnophis sirtalis) consisting of up to 50\% jet-black melanistic
   individuals. Total number of amphibian and reptile species is positively
   correlated with island area but uncorrelated with distance to the
   mainland; however, among salamanders, species numbers decrease with
   increasing distance to the mainland.}},

Abstract = {{Of 722 cetaceans captured mostly in multi-filament gillnets and landed
   at Cerro Azul, central Peru, in 87 days during January-August 1994,
   82.7\% were dusky dolphin Lagenorhynchus obscurus, 12.6\% Burmeister's
   porpoise Phocoena spinipinnis, 2.4\% long-beaked common dolphin
   Delphinus capensis and 2.4\% bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus. The
   total kill estimate for a seven-month period, stratified by month, was
   1567 +/- 237 (SE) cetaceans. Data collected at 16 other ports showed
   that high levels of dolphin and porpoise mortality persisted in coastal
   Peru at least until August 1994 when an unimplemented 1990 ban on small
   cetacean exploitation was renewed. Circumstantial evidence suggests
   that, thereafter, increasing enforcement reduced direct takes and
   illegal trade in meat but also hampered monitoring. The absence of
   abundance data precludes any assessment of impact on populations. An
   interview study in October-December 1994 of the extensive multi-filament
   gillnet fishery from Puerto Bolivar in southern Ecuador indicated,
   despite a low catch rate per boar, an estimated annual take of 227
   bottlenose dolphins in the inner estuary of the Gulf of Guayaquil. This
   represents some 9\% of the resident bottlenose dolphin population, or
   more than twice its estimated birth rate. Two mono-filament gillnet
   boats did not report any entangled cetaceans. (C) 1997 Published by

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring populations of immature and adult Geocoris
   punctipes, adult Cobomegilla maculata and immature coccinellids were
   monitored on field-grown tomato lines susceptible and resistant to
   Manduca sexta and Helicoverpa zea. Helicoverpa tea and Heliothis
   virescens eggs and small larvae that serve as prey for these predators
   also were monitored. More H. zea and H. virescens eggs and small larvae
   were found on resistant than on susceptible plant lines. However,
   similar populations of large H. tea and H. virescens larvae were found
   on resistant and susceptible plants. The number of adult Geocoris
   punctipes, adult Coleomegilla maculata and immature coccinellids on
   resistant plants was always as high or higher than the number on
   susceptible plants. The data demonstrate no incompatibility of
   host-plant resistance with biological control provided by these
   predaceous insects, but indicate that the number of G. punctipes and
   coccinellids required to provide effective biological control may
   develop too late in the season to be of practical value. Large
   populations of stilt bugs (Jalysus wickhami, Hemiptera: Berytidae) and
   spiders were observed to occur earlier in the growing season than either
   G. punctipes or coccinellids and may be a significant source of
   mortality for H. tea eggs and small larvae. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Augmentative releases of Catolaccus grandis (Burks) were conducted in
   the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas in an attempt to suppress
   infestations of bob weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman, occurring in
   stands of `'fallow-season'' cotton (i.e., fields in violation of the 1
   September stalk destruction deadline mandated by Texas law). In each of
   five release sites monitored during the study period (October,
   1994-March 1995), augmentative releases of C. grandis were accompanied
   by an appreciable increase in the incidence of parasitized boil weevils
   (primarily third-stage larvae and pupae infesting abcised cotton
   squares) within a relatively brief time period. The relatively high
   incidence of host mortality caused by C. grandis in each release site
   was largely indispensible (i.e., would not have occurred in the absence
   of the parasite) and served to destroy significant numbers of immature
   boil weevils that appear to have been predisposed to successfully
   overwinter. The potential role of parasite augmentation in the
   management of the overwintering boil weevil population in southern Texas
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Forty-three flocks of Eastern Wild Turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo
   silvestris), 26 of which contained greater than or equal to 1 bird with
   a functional radio, were used to compare the number of flocks and number
   of birds counted in winter by aerial observers with known numbers on the
   ground. Research was conducted in an experimental turkey hunting zone
   (THZ) where Turkeys were intensively monitored as part of a population
   dynamics study. Helicopter-based counts (H) of total flocks and total
   birds avenged 86\% and 80\%, respectively, of ground-based (G) counts in
   the THZ where H/G comparisons were made in 1989, 1991, and 1993. Turkey
   densities adjusted by the 0.80 H/G ratio based on the total number of
   birds counted by helicopter-and ground-based observers in the
   experimental THZ, varied from 0.9 to 11.0/km(2) during 12 helicopter
   counts in 5 THZs during 1989-1994. Turkey densities were correlated (P =
   0.025) with the spring harvest density derived from the number of
   gobblers killed/km(2) of forest from mandatory registration. Helicopter
   surveys of Wild Turkeys are most applicable in areas dominated by
   deciduous woodlands and agricultural crop fields where snow depths
   greater than or equal to 15 cm occur.}},

Abstract = {{A decline in abundance of the Deer Mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, in the
   Kananaskis Valley, Alberta in 1992-1993 was followed by a slow recovery
   of some local populations. We attempted to recolonize one depopulated
   area by releasing laboratory raised mice and monitoring persistence by
   livetrapping. Only 14 (15\%) of 92 mice released were subsequently
   recorded at the release site, with only one mouse persisting until the
   end of the summer. However, 8 (9\%) of the introduced mice were
   recovered on another depopulated area 1 km away, where they remained
   until the end of the summer. We suggest that factors other than the
   colonization ability of the introduced mice may have played a role in
   the unsuccessful colonization.}},

Abstract = {{Most marine animals have complex life histories with dispersive larvae.
   Recruitment to marine populations should then result from larval
   production external to each population (i.e., an open population).
   However, it has been suggested that self-recruitment to these
   populations may also be important (i.e., a closed system). The
   contribution of these two sources of larval supply to recruitment were
   explored using the Hawaiian domino damselfish, Dascyllus albisella.
   Spawning and recruitment were monitored daily and weekly in the
   southeast section of Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, during 1992. Daily
   increment formation in the otoliths of this species was validated, and
   the spawning dates of arriving recruits were back-calculated using
   otolith rings. Since this section of Kaneohe Bay is sheltered, with a
   water exchange rate of only 26\% per day, I predicted larvae would be
   retained (passively and behaviorally) after hatching; therefore
   recruitment from locally spawned larvae would be important.
   Contrary to my prediction, no self-recruitment was evident. Spawning
   times and backcalculated production of recruits did not overlap on a
   daily or seasonal basis. During the first half of the year, recruitment
   pulses were large and associated with rises in water temperature. During
   the latter half of the year, recruitment rates were lower and
   recruitment events were not associated with water temperature. Given the
   apparent absence of self-recruitment and the seasonal pattern of
   oceanographic currents in the Hawaiian Islands, recruitment episodes in
   the first half of the year may have originated from distinct
   reproductive episodes at upcurrent islands. Recruitment episodes in the
   latter half of the year may have resulted from a general increase in D.

Abstract = {{Peripheral applications of organophosphate insecticides were evaluated
   as an alternative strategy for controlling adult plum curculio,
   Conotrachelus nenuphar Herbst (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in four
   commercial orchards in Quebec, Canada. Each orchard was partitioned into
   a reference and an experimental plot to compare the classical full plot
   treatment with a peripheral treatment alternative. The experimental
   plots were divided into five zones, i.e. central, North, South, West and
   East. Peripheral zones were defined as the first five rows of apple
   trees (or 20 m wide). Plum curculio adults were monitored weekly by limb
   tapping. Fresh oviposition scars were evaluated by examining 20
   fruitlets per tree on each outermost tree in the peripheral zone and 20
   fruit on 25 trees in the central zone. Azinphosmethyl treatments were
   carried out in the zones where more than 1\% fruitlets bore fresh
   ovipositional scars. Fruit damage was mostly (92\%) found in the
   peripheral zones. Plum curculio damage at harvest varied from 0.0 to
   0.7\% and from 0.0 to 0.8\% in the experimental and reference plots
   respectively. Total insect damage on fruit at harvest varied from 1.3 to
   3.8\% in the experimental plots, and from 0.4 to 5.0\% in the reference
   plots. In 1991, there were no significant differences between population
   indices of the spotted tentiform leafminer, the apple aphid, leafroller
   species and cicadellids in the peripheral versus central zones. In the
   experimental plots, populations of woolly apple aphid, two-spotted
   spider mite and apple rust mite were significantly higher in peripheral
   zones than in the central zones. In 1992, there were no significant
   differences between population indices of peripheral versus central
   zones for both experimental and reference plots. All localities and
   years pooled, peripheral zones of experimental plots received 1.22
   insecticide treatments, against 1.29 for reference plots. However,
   central zones of experimental plots received 0.38 insecticide
   treatments, against 1.13 for reference plots. Assuming a 20 m peripheral
   zone and a 10 ha square orchard, the percent reduction in insecticides
   would be ca. 75\%.}},

Abstract = {{Linyphiid spiders were sampled in three grass and four cereal fields,

   characteristic of field type and pattern of management. Agricultural
   operations caused large population depletions: insecticide applications,
   cutting grass for silage and autumn cultivations reduced spider
   populations by 56\% to 96\%; heavy grazing caused virtual extinction.
   Aerial dispersal activity, monitored by water traps, showed high
   dispersal frequency with highest intensity in June, July and August. The
   results are discussed with reference to the large-scale spatial
   structure of linyphiid spider populations and the use of spatially

Abstract = {{Concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-(TCDD) equivalents
   were measured in extracts of Baltic white-tailed sea eagle tissues.
   Extracts of salmon, ringed seal, and grey seal were analyzed as other
   predatory species of the same area. Concentrations in eagle and seal
   tissues were greater than those in salmon. Concentrations of TCDD
   equivalents (TCDD-EQs) determined by the H4IIE bioassay were compared
   with toxic equivalents (TEQs) derived from instrumental chemical
   analyses in fractions containing polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and
   polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) or coplanar polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs). Toxic equivalents were calculated by use of an
   additive model in which the product of the concentrations of
   instrumentally measured individual congeners were multiplied by their
   TCDD equivalency factors and were summed to give a total concentration
   of TEQs. The TCDD-EQs were compared with TEQs to develop a mass balance
   to determine whether all the TCDD-like activity was accounted for. For
   example, the concentration of TCDD-EQs in the coplanar PCB fraction of
   the most contaminated eagle was 980 pg/g fresh weight (fw), and that of
   the PCDD/PCDF fraction was 240 pg/g fw. The TEQs determined by chemical
   analyses for coplanar PCBs was 770 pp/g fw, and that of PCDD/PCDFs was
   270 pg/g fw in this eagle. Thus, concentrations of TCDD-EQs were approx.
   20\% greater than those of TEQs. The true difference in activities is
   probably greater because of lower recoveries and infra-additivities
   among congeners in the bioassay. This indicates that there are compounds
   present in the extracts that can contribute to the total concentrations
   of TCDD-EQs that were not accounted for by TEQs. The hazard quotient,
   calculated as the ratio of current concentrations of TCDD-EQs in
   white-tailed sea eagle eggs to the no-observable-adverse-effect
   concentration, ranged from 7.3 to 141 (mean = 52.7, SD = 43). This
   indicates that current concentrations of TCDD-EQs in these eggs are
   likely causing adverse effects in the Baltic populations of white-tailed
   sea eagles. This study indicated that the H4IIE bioassay is useful for
   monitoring the presence and biological activity of TCDD-like compounds
   in environmental samples like white-tailed sea eagles.}},

Abstract = {{American Falls Reservoir in southeastern Idaho is an irrigation
   reservoir used as an inland feeding stopover by many shorebird species.
   Six exclosure experiments were conducted during the 1990 drawdown period
   to investigate shorebird predation impact on benthic macroinvertebrate
   populations. The study sites differed in sediment composition, sediment
   slope, invertebrate densities, and shorebird abundance. Shorebird
   predation significantly affected invertebrate densities in only 1 of 6
   experiments (Aberdeen Mouth). This site had higher sediment slope and
   slower water recedence than other study sites, resulting in
   concentration of shorebird predation on a smaller area of newly exposed
   sediment. Shorebird predation had the greatest impact on medium size
   class chironomid larvae at Aberdeen Mouth. Our results suggest that
   inland sites such as American Falls Reservoir represent viable shorebird
   habitat and may be managed to insure consistent prey availability.
   Drawdown rate, sediment slope, invertebrate densities, and shorebird
   abundance are all important factors influencing shorebird predation.
   Monitoring shorebird abundance and predation impact on invertebrate
   densities may help in manipulating drawdown rate to provide adequate
   shorebird prey. Management of inland sites for shorebird use may become
   more important in the future as human encroachment in coastal areas
   continues.}},

Abstract = {{The Marshall Islands were the site of numerous tests of nuclear weapons
   by the United States. From 1946 to 1958, nuclear devices were detonated
   at Enewetak and Bikini Atolls. Following the inadvertent contamination
   of the northern islands downwind of the 1954 Bravo Test, Brookhaven
   National Laboratory became involved in the medical care and the
   radiological safety of the affected populations, One important technique
   employed in assessing the internally deposited radionuclides is
   whole-body counting. To estimate current and future exposures to Cs-137,
   data from 1989 to 1994 were analyzed and are reported in this paper,
   During this period, 3,618 measurements were made for the Marshallese.
   The cesium body contents were assumed to result from a series of chronic
   intakes. Also, it was assumed that cesium activity in the body reaches a
   plateau that is maintained over 365 d. We estimated the annual effective
   dose rate for each population, derived from the recommendations of the
   International Commission on Radiological Protection, The average Cs-137
   uptake measured by the whole-body counting method varies from one
   population io another: it was consistent with measurements of external
   exposure rate. The analysis, though based on limited data, indicates
   that there is no statistical support for a seasonal effect on Cs-137
   uptake, The critical population group for cesium uptake is adult males.
   Within the 5-y monitoring period, all internal exposures to Cs-137 were
   less than 0.2 mSv y(-1). Similarly, a persistent average cesium
   effective dose rate of 2 mu Sv y(-1) was determined for Majuro
   residents.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1980, the inhabitants of Enewetak Atoll have been monitored
   periodically by scientists from Brookhaven National Laboratory for
   internally deposited radioactive material, In 1989, the establishment of
   fission track analysis and of a protocol for shipboard collection of
   24-h urine samples significantly improved our ability to assess the
   internal uptake of plutonium, The purpose of this report is to show the
   distribution of plutonium concentrations in urine collected in 1989 and
   1991, and to assess the associated committed effective doses for the
   Enewetak population based on a long-term chronic uptake of low-level
   plutonium, To estimate dose, we derived the plutonium
   dose-per-unit-uptake coefficients based on the dosimetric system of the
   International Commission on Radiological Protection, Assuming a
   continuous uptake, an integrated Jones's plutonium urine excretion
   function was developed to interpret the Enewetak urine data. The
   Appendix shows how these values were derived. The committed effective
   doses were 0.2 mSv, calculated from the 1991 average plutonium content
   in 69 urine samples.}},

Abstract = {{The gastrointestinal absorption constant (f(1)) is a critical parameter
   in assessing systemic uptake following the ingestion of a radioactive
   material and in monitoring such intakes, This study addresses the
   latter, particularly for plutonium, and from environmental measurements
   derives an f(1) value of 4 x 10(-4) for the Marshallese population, The
   uncertainty associated with the methodology and measurements used in
   this f(1) value assessment is evaluated, This evaluation takes into
   account the results from 24-h urine samples and the particular lifestyle
   of the Marshallese, Plutonium intake resulting from soil consumption is
   a primary parameter in this evaluation; for this study, it was assumed
   to be 500 mg d(-1). The f(1) value determined here is consistent with
   the values in ICRP Publication 67 of 5 x 10(-4) for ages 1 to adult, and
   is the same as that suggested by the NRPB.}},

Abstract = {{In 1954, 253 Marshallese were accidentally exposed to fallout radiation
   from the hydrogen bomb, BRAVO. The Marshall Islands Medical Program
   (MIMP) was established by the Department of Energy in 1955 to monitor
   and treat radiation-related disease pursuant to this accident, Medical
   teams from Brookhaven National Laboratory, a federal institution,
   regularly visit the Marshall Islands to give medical care to the exposed
   population, The most significant complication of the exposure has been
   found to be thyroid disease due to the ingestion of radioactive iodides
   from the fallout, In 1963 the first thyroid nodules were found in
   Rongelap subjects and in 1969 in Utirik. Non-neoplastic adenomatous
   nodules were associated with higher doses of radiation and neoplastic
   nodules developed in individuals receiving lower doses of initiation,
   Women were more susceptible to the development of palpable thyroid
   nodules than men, In 1994 the MIMP initiated examination of the thyroid
   by ultrasound to supplement the clinical examination. One hundred and
   sixty-four patients were evaluated. No significant differences were
   found in the incidence of thyroid nodules or the mean nodule count
   between the three groups of Rongelap and Utirik exposed and a comparison
   patient population, There mas no significant difference in the incidence
   of thyroid nodules in males vs, females, Five exposed patients were
   referred for surgical excision of a nodule detected only by ultrasound,
   These ultrasound findings are unexpected in that females are known to
   have a higher incidence of thyroid disease than males and ne expected
   that the incidence of ultrasound nodules would be higher in the exposed
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Relay intercropping winter and spring strip crops with cotton was used
   to conserve and enhance the numbers of predators of the cotton aphid
   (Aphis gossypii Glover) in 1992, 1993 and 1994 in northern Texas, USA.
   Numbers of aphids and aphid predators in cotton isolated from other
   crops were compared with numbers where canola, wheat, sorghum (strip
   intercrops) and cotton were planted adjacent to each other and
   overlapped temporally. Aphid and predator populations were also
   monitored in the intercrop. The intercrops acted as a reservoir for
   predators during the non-cotton season; these intercrops `relayed' aphid
   predators from canola and wheat in the winter to sorghum in the spring
   and finally to cotton in the summer. Averaged over the three years of
   the study, predator numbers in the intercrops were highest in sorghum
   and lowest in wheat. In ail years, canola had higher predator numbers
   than wheat, suggesting that it would be a better winter intercrop than
   wheat for enhancing predator numbers. Average aphid abundance was lower
   in relay intercropped cotton than in isolated cotted each year. The
   three-year average in relay intercropped cotton remained fewer than 193
   aphids per leaf on any one sample date, but reached 490 aphids per leaf
   in isolated cotton. Seasonal abundance of aphid populations was bimodal
   in relay intercropped cotton, with peaks in early August and early
   September, while populations peaked only once in late August in isolated
   cotton. Average predator numbers were higher in relay intercropped
   cotton than in isolated cotton, and predators appeared in higher numbers
   earlier in the summer in relay intercropped cotton than in isolated
   cotton. Results from this study suggest that where cotton is grown
   without insecticides, relay intercropping aids the early arrival and
   continuous population increase of predators in cotton, thereby reducing
   numbers and postponing the initial population increase of the cotton
   aphid.}},

Abstract = {{Helopeltis pernicialis damage to a cashew crop was very serious in each
   of two years, resulting in no harvest unless the trees were protected
   either by pesticides or biological control agents. A control threshold
   was determined by a combination of the net income from increased yield
   and the frequency of insecticide use. A damage level of 1-5\% achieved
   the highest net profit. A damage level of 6-10\% resulted in yield that
   was over 73\% of the yield of the 1-5\% damage level, but required one
   third less pesticide application. Therefore, it appears that 6-10\%
   damage level can be regarded as a control threshold for H. pernicialis.
   The pre-flowering flush appeared to be the most appropriate time to
   carry out the monitoring and spray programme to control H. pernicialis.
   Preliminary results showed that at the time when H. pernicialis caused
   serious damage to a tree without O. smaragdina nests, a tree with a
   constant ant population was only slightly damaged, and the damage level
   never exceeded the control threshold of 6-10\%. It is suggested that O.
   smaragdina has high potential as a biological control agent.}},

Abstract = {{Insecticide and juvenoid mixtures were evaluated for 12 mo in the field
   against an insecticide-resistant field population of the German
   cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), in infested apartments. Treatments
   consisted of three mixtures: (1) Empire 20(R) and Gentrol(R) (i.e.,
   chlorpyrifos and hydroprene); (2) Commodore(R), Nylar(R), and PBO-8(R)
   (i.e., lamdacyhalothrin, pyriproxyfen, and piperonyl butoxide); and (3)
   Diacap 300CS(R) and Torus(R) (i.e., diazinon and fenoxycarb). Sticky
   trap catch was used to monitor population numbers, and there were no
   significant differences between treatment regimes at any pre-or
   posttreatment evaluation periods. Trap catch reductions increased
   throughout the study to 95.3\%, 90.7\%, and 85.3\% at the end of the
   test for Empire, Commodore, and Diacap treatments, respectively.
   Percentage of wing twist (an indicator of juvenoid-induced sterility)
   increased over time and reached over 80\% at 6 mo for all treatments. In
   addition, the ratios of nymphs to adults (an indicator of population
   productivity) and gravid to nongravid females (a measure of population
   fertility levels) were reduced by all mixtures. Results of this study
   indicate the potential usefulness of mixtures of conventional
   insecticides and juvenoids in integrated pest management and resistance

Abstract = {{1. Interference competition in a wild population of European blackbirds
   was examined by comparing the feeding rates of individual birds feeding
   alone and with the addition of a competitor within small, experimental
   feeding patches.
   2. Blackbirds showed type II functional responses. There was a highly
   significant decrease in feeding rate on addition of a competing
   individual to a patch: average declines in feeding rates of an
   individual on addition of a competitor, where nearest neighbour distance
   was always less than about 5 m, were between 16\% and 43\% of the
   feeding rate of a lone individual.
   3. The decline in feeding rate was similar whether the individuals
   interacted aggressively or apparently ignored each other during feeding.
   When patch size was doubled, the effects on feeding rate of adding a
   single competitor remained similar. The high levels of interference
   recorded may therefore have been mainly a consequence of active rather
   than passive interference competition.
   4. The results suggest that the costs to an individual blackbird of
   monitoring other individuals within a group in order to avoid
   interactions may be sufficiently high to counter any benefits of group
   feeding, such as vigilance benefits.}},

Abstract = {{1. Self-thinning, the reduction in density (N) as a consequence of the
   increase in the mean weight (W) of individuals, occurs widely in
   populations of plants when their growth is constrained at high
   densities, but has only recently been reported to occur within
   populations of wild mobile animals. It has been suggested that a
   self-thinning relationship in which the gradient (Delta log(W)/Delta
   log(N)) approximates to -1.33 describes concomitant changes in W and N
   within cohorts of a population of anadromous brown trout (sea trout)
   Salmo trutta throughout their lives as juveniles in fresh water. This
   apparent self-thinning occurs with no evidence of density-dependent
   growth or mortality (as measured by key-factor analysis) after the
   critical period.
   2. Here, the relationship between weights and densities of trout has
   been examined further. A linear model incorporating log(N), year class
   and time of year explained 99.5\% of the variation in log(W), giving a
   significantly better fit than incorporating only log(N) and year class.
   Variation in log(N) explained 85\% of the variation in log(W); the
   addition of year class increased this value by 6\% and the addition of
   monitoring period increased it by a further 8.5\%.
   3. The gradients for the relationships between log(W) and log(N) within
   years varied significantly with time of the year. pooled thinning
   trajectories for the first winter of the life of trout differed
   significantly from a gradient of -1.33, while those for the second
   summer were highly variable and sometimes positive (suggesting that
   immigration could exceed mortality). Thinning trajectories over the
   first summer of life were related inversely to the densities of trout at
   the start of the monitoring period in that summer (N-s), but this
   relation appeared to approach an asymptote at high values of N-s. The
   mean of the thinning trajectories for cohorts with high N-s (exceeding
   300 fish 60 m(-2)) was not significantly different from -1.33. However,
   these slopes were shown to result primarily from the presence of high
   numbers of failed nonterritorial fish early in the summer rather than
   true thinning throughout the summer.
   4. The apparent absence of a simple consistent thinning relationship
   after a critical period in the first couple of months of the lives of
   cohorts can be explained by three factors. First, the total availability
   of limiting resources, such as space and food, is not constant but
   changes with the mean size of the trout. Secondly, there is a winter
   cessation of growth. Thirdly, trout switch to use different habitats
   during their development. The implications for interpreting thinning
   relationships for salmonid fishes in general are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic change may alter vegetation composition and structure, but the
   response to climatic change can be expected to be spatially
   heterogeneous. Tree populations in the alpine forest-tundra ecotone, for
   example, map find only certain locations to be favourable for
   regeneration and growth. If monitoring and detection of vegetation
   responses to climatic change is to be most successful, the monitoring
   system must be tuned to the locations where a response is most likely.
   We used the GRASS geographical information system (GIS) to map
   population parameters indicating potential change throughout the
   forest-tundra ecotone (FTE) of Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP).
   Seedling density in patch forest and krummholz openings, as well as
   annual krummholz height growth, were measured in the field. These
   parameters were then modelled over the heterogeneity of the FTE
   environment, using principle components regression analysis. The GRASS
   GIS was used to extrapolate the resulting predictive equations to the
   entire RMNP FTE. Potential FTE responses to climate change were
   evaluated in the context of species-specific differences in how tree
   seedling density and krummholz height growth are associated with the
   present environment. For example, climate change leading towards moister
   conditions, causing currently xeric environments to become more mesic,
   might increase the spatial extent of existing tree invasion into patch
   forest openings. This would increase the potential for widespread
   conversion of patch forest to closed forest. Present population
   parameters extrapolated spatially may provide a useful guide to where
   future change is likely.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal variations of the potential of Gulf coast marshes to degrade
   crude oil naturally or under nutrient-enhanced conditions is essentially
   unknown. Seasonal variations in crude oil mineralization were determined
   under ambient and enhanced nutrient conditions for both a fresh- and a
   salt-water marsh in Louisiana's Barataria basin over a 1-yr period.
   Mineralization of (C-14) phenanthrene and hexadecane was measured by
   radiorespirometry in marsh soil slurries dosed with crude oil under
   ambient and enhanced nutrient conditions. Background nutrient conditions
   in these marsh systems, as well as numbers of hydrocarbon-utilizing
   microorganisms, were also monitored. Seasonal variations were found in
   both marsh systems, although they were greater in salt marsh. Seasonal
   trends in mineralization rates were different for phenanthrene and
   hexadecane as well as for each marsh. Hexadecane mineralization rates
   ranged form 0.2 to 2.4\%/d (ambient nutrient conditions) and 3.1 to
   10.4\%/d (enhanced nutrient conditions) for the salt marsh and 0.81 to
   3.1\%/d (ambient nutrient conditions) and 2.1 to 7.3\%/d (enhanced
   nutrient conditions) for the fresh marsh. Phenanthrene mineralization
   rates ranged from 0.5 to 4.5\%/d (ambient nutrient conditions) and 1.9
   to 12.1\%/d (enhanced nutrient conditions) for the salt marsh and 2.8 to
   5.5\%/d (ambient nutrient conditions) and 2.4 to 5.6\%/d (enhanced
   nutrient conditions) for the fresh marsh. Nutrient enhancement reduced
   the lag time of hexadecane mineralization in both salt and fresh marsh
   soils but had little effect on phenanthrene mineralization lag time. The
   population of hydrocarbon utilizers was correlated to phenanthrene
   mineralization rates under ambient and enhanced nutrient conditions in
   the fresh marsh, and to hexadecane mineralization rates under ambient
   and enhanced nutrient conditions for the salt marsh. Mineralization
   rates of phenanthrene and hexadecane appear to be uncorrelated for both
   marshes. Both the fresh marsh and salt marsh soils examined had a
   substantial capacity to degrade representative crude oil components
   under ambient conditions. Nutrient enhancement had the greatest benefit
   in the salt marsh studies, and seasonal differences in the rates of
   hexadecane and phenanthrene mineralization under both ambient and
   enhanced nutrient conditions were significant.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental sex determination (ESD) permits adaptive sex choice under
   patchy environmental conditions, where the environment affects
   sex-specific fitness and where offspring can predict their likely adult
   status by monitoring an appropriate environmental cue. For Gammarus
   duebeni, an amphipod with ESD, it has been proposed that this flexible
   sex determination system is adaptive because males gain more from large
   size. Under ESD, young which are born earlier in the season become
   mostly males and, experiencing longer to grow, are therefore larger at
   breeding than females which are born later in the season. In order to
   test the hypothesis that ESD is adaptive for this species we
   investigated the relationship between size and fitness for both males
   and females, in a population of G. duebeni known to have ESD. We
   measured size related pairing success and fecundity, and used these two
   measures to calculate the relative fitness gains achieved through an
   increase in size for either sex. The fitness of both males and females
   increased with size, but males gained more from an increase in size than
   did females, throughout the breeding season. The data support the
   adaptive explanation for the evolution and maintenance of ESD in this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific competition is widely regarded as an important structuring
   mechanism in coral assemblages, yet there is little evidence available
   to determine what influence it has on the fitness of individual
   colonies. Fitness has been shown to decline in scleractinian corals
   engaged in competition with macroalgae and in intraspecific competition.
   However, the only attempts to investigate the costs of interspecific
   competition between scleractinian corals have not examined both growth
   and reproduction. In this paper I show, by monitoring experimental
   contacts, that competition between several species of scleractinian
   coral has consequences for colony fitness. Both Pocillopora damicornis
   (Linnaeus) and Acropora hyacinthus (Dana) experienced substantial
   declines in growth rates when competing against other corals compared to
   non-competing controls, although mortality was not affected. Growth in
   A. hyacinthus decreased from 120 to 35\%, while in P. damicornis it
   decreased from 45 to - 16\% (i.e. one group of competing colonies shrank
   in average size). An examination of the effects of competition on
   reproduction of A. hyacinthus showed that at the polyp level, there is
   no detectable response. This conclusion is reversed at the colony level,
   because the reduction in growth rate leads to smaller colonies which are
   less fecund. This reduction in colony fecundity due to a decrease in
   size is partially compensated for by a decrease in the number of
   non-reproductive polyps in the colony. Size-classified matrix models of
   cohort dynamics show that competition has a major influence on cohort
   survival for A. hyacinthus, but little effect for P. damicornis. This
   reduction in cohort survival can be directly equated to a decrease in
   fitness. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variation in the recruitment of many marine
   invertebrate and fish species is thought to strongly affect patterns in
   their demersal abundance. Variation in recruitment of the temperate zone
   annual goby Sagamia geneionema (Hilgendorf) over eight sand patches
   within a 1 ha area was investigated during 3 consecutive years
   (1992-1994). I evaluated the relative importance of recruitment and
   postrecruitment processes in determining adult density by monitoring the
   abundance, survival, and growth of juveniles in each patch. In 1992 and
   1994, despite pronounced spatial variation in recruitment among sand
   patches, patterns of recruit abundance established at the end of the
   settlement season (mid-June or early July) were clearly modified through
   postrecruitment density-dependent mortality. Consequently, densities in
   mid-December, when all surviving fish become adults, were stabilized at
   a low level across patches. The period of mortality which contributed
   most to stabilizing adult densities was from mid-August to mid-September
   in both years. In contrast to 1992 and 1994, adult numbers in 1993
   directly reflected variation in recruitment success across patches as a
   result of density-independent mortality, even though recruits were the
   most numerous in this year. Furthermore, no density-dependent growth was
   detected in either the juvenile or adult phase. These patterns indicate
   that, in 1993, recruitment was the major determinant of adult numbers,
   and competition for resources was unimportant. Thus, the results of this
   study suggest that both recruitment and postrecruitment processes can
   influence the demography of demersal populations, and their relative
   importance can vary from year to year. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In the Camargue (southern France), movements of fish between a canal and
   two seasonally flooded marshes were monitored continuously by fish traps
   for 3 years for one marsh and for 2 years for the other. The tinting of
   the entry and exit of the main species was determined together with
   species annual demographic balance, defined as the difference between
   the number of fish leaving and the number of fish entering. Only some of
   the species inhabiting the canal colonized the marshes. Except those
   species that reproduced in salt or brackish waters, all the species
   colonizing, the marshes reproduced in it. The most abundant of these
   species were small sized (mosquitofish, sand smelt and three-spined
   stickleback). The unpredictability of water levels in summer was
   particularly unfavourable for recruitment and survival of species that
   breed late in the year, e.g. pumpkinseed sunfish, or which prolonged
   their stay in the marsh and only attempted to leave just before the
   connection was broken, e.g. carp. Only the three-spined stickleback
   always had a positive demographic balance as a result of colonizing the
   marshes. Adults of this species entered in winter and young-of-the-year
   left in April. By limiting its stay in the seasonally flooded marshes,
   the stickleback minimized the risks related to environmental
   unpredictability. These results suggest that hydrology (temporal
   variations of water depth) may influence the fish community structure
   through interspecific differences in survival and recruitment. as a
   result of temporal variations in the use of seasonally flooded marshes.

Abstract = {{Protecting stored grain from insect damage, with minimum pesticide risk,
   will require pest management based on comprehensive understanding of
   storage environments and their interactions with pest populations.
   Computer modeling offers the means to this understanding. To obtain data
   sets for modeling selected pests of stored maize, we studied maize
   storages on six farms in a four-county area of southwestern South
   Carolina. Grain moisture content was measured monthly, and grain
   temperatures were recorded hourly for one storage season. Insect
   populations were monitored by taking grain and pitfall trap samples at
   weekly or monthly intervals. Hourly mean grain temperatures remained
   below optimal levels for growth and development of insects during most
   of the storage period. Grain moisture content varied from 11.2 to
   16.4\%. Forty three species of insects and one species complex,
   representing 26 families in four orders, were detected. The estimated
   importance of each species in the farm storage habitat, as measured by
   relative abundance and frequency of occurrence, depended on whether
   grain sampling or trapping was used. With trapping, Cryptolestes species
   (mostly C. pusillus (Schonherr)), the Carpophilus dimidiatus complex (C.
   dimidiatus (F.), C. freemani Dobson and C. mutilatus Erichson),
   Sitophilus species (mostly S. zeamais Motschulsky), Xylocoris flavipes
   (Reuter) and Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) appeared most important.
   With grain sampling, S. zeamais, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier) and C.
   pusillus appeared most important. Insects were most abundant (or active)
   in the fall and again in the spring, if storage extended that long.
   Grain samples indicated more insects near the grain surface, but traps
   sometimes detected more near the bottom of the bulk. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The flowering phenology, flower production, and insect visitation was
   determined for Anaxagorea crassipetala in a lowland rain forest study
   population containing fifty-two trees over 1.5 cm DBH. Flowering of each
   tree was monitored daily; 71\% of the trees in the study population
   flowered producing a mean of 31.1 flowers/day. Flowers are cauliflorous,
   pendant, 2.4-2.7 cm long, with three prominant creamy white, fleshy,
   outer petals, which represented 63\% of floral biomass. Typical of
   cantharophily, flowers were protogynous, fruit-mimicking with a spicy,
   fruity fragrance. The perianth formed an enclosure, and rewards
   consisted of a protected location. stigmatic exudate, and petals capable
   of being used as a brood substrate. Anthesis commenced at first light,
   05:05, tasting nearly 24 h. The receptive female phase preceeded the
   brief pollen-dispersing phase that began 0.5 h before the corolla and
   androecium shattered, ending anthesis. Four species of Coleopterans were
   floral visitors, 3 Nitidulidae and 1 Staphylimidae. Visitation rates
   peaked with population flowering, but decreased to zero after 33 days. A
   weevil (Cyrionyx sp.) was observed on buds and petals, and 1014 buds
   (43\% of total) aborted, the result of a weevil larvae feeding in each
   bud. Fruit flies (Diptera: Drosophilidae) were frequently observed on
   buds and petals. At anthesis fruit fly larvae were feeding in 100\% of
   outer petals, but no beetle larvae were found. None of the Coleopteran
   floral visitors carried a pollen load and none of the 1306 flowers was
   pollinated.}},

Abstract = {{I carried out a nine year demographic study of Helenium virginicum Blake
   using permanent quadrats at one sinkhole pond in the eastern United
   Stares to gain insight into factors controlling the distribution and
   abundance of this plant. I monitored recruitment and mortality of
   genets, their stage classes, and their distribution in relation to water
   depth and overstory cover. The occurrence and distribution of a seed
   bank was studied as well as the survival and demography of transplants.
   Comparisons of soil chemistry and general patterns of distribution and
   abundance within sites were made between the study site and other
   populations. The annual hydroperiod at the sinkhole pond varied from
   4-16 months of continuous inundation during winter and summer with
   plants growing at sites with low overstory cover and at maximum water
   depths of from 49-59 cm. After 16 months of continuous inundation and
   heavy accumulation of floating aquatic vegetation, all H, virginicum
   plants had died at the study site. At the same time, other neighboring
   populations with inundation as long and deep did not accumulate a cover
   of floating vegetation and their populations did not decline noticeably.
   These data suggest that H, virginicum is intolerant of shade. Following
   death of all H. virginicum plants at the study site, soil sampling and a
   large pulse of recruitment gave evidence of a seed bank which was at
   least two years old. Annual recruitment and the proportion of plants in
   stage classes was highly variable; survival of the early stage plants
   was low. A highly variable population size suggests a high probability
   of local extinction of the population at the study site if future
   investment in the seed bank should fail to occur Chemical analyses of
   soils from 19 of the 21 sites in which H. virginicum grows, revealed a
   low pH, high levels of Al and As, and low levels of B, Ca, K, Mg, and P.
   Endemism of this plant may result from it being limited to refugia where
   competition is reduced by a stressful soil and a variable hydroperiod,
   and where the variable hydroperiod leads to high rates of local
   extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Learning to manage wildlife communities and ecosystems for stability
   dynamic change or yield is an endeavor of general value, but we are not

   representative number of protected areas as ecological baseline controls
   to help in understanding the effects of humans worldwide, and thus to
   enhance our ability to manage natural resources for a nide range of
   goals. The decision to manage protected areas as ecological baseline
   controls has several practical consequences, including that: (1) no
   effort is made to maintain an ecological status quo; (2) human
   interference that confounds natural ecological processes is kept to a
   minimum; (3) monitoring of natural and human-induced changes inside and
   adjacent to baseline controls is essential; and (4) if subjective
   opinion perceives that human effects are, nevertheless, altering the
   system, then management intervention should be carried out on part of
   the system only leaving die rest as its own control.}},

Abstract = {{From 1991 through 1994, 65 adult woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   caribou) were radiocollared and monitored across 20,000 km(2) of

   both years it was measured, with calves composing a mean of 9.0\% of the
   March populations. Highest calf mortality occurred during the first
   month of life. The population rate-of-increase, r, was -0.08 (lambda =
   0.92), suggesting the population was declining. Caribou locations were
   restricted to peatlands, with 98.7\% of locations falling within the 5
   fen complexes in the study area. There was little permanent movement
   (5\% of individuals over 4 yr) among fen complexes. Multi-year home
   ranges (100\% minimum convex polygon; MCP) averaged 711 km(2), with the
   size of individual home ranges (HR) correlated with the area of fen
   complexes. Summer HRs were smaller than winter HRs, and smaller for
   females than males in summer, but not winter. Locations were further
   from fen/upland boundaries winter than in summer, and further from
   fen/upland boundaries than random points within fens in both seasons.
   Movement rates were highest in winter and lowest in summer, and did not
   differ between sexes. There was a negative correlation between movement
   rate and snow depth at month-end. Monthly trends in group size
   paralleled those in movement rates, while group composition was
   relatively stable throughout most of the year. Trends in group size,
   movement, and spatial distribution suggest caribou increased spacing
   among themselves during summer, and were more concentrated during
   winter. The study ar ea consisted of 2 different landscapes, varying in
   the amount and configuration of fen patches. When we compared caribou
   biology between the 2 areas, we found lower calf survival and smaller
   home ranges in the landscape with smaller Fen patches and a higher
   proportion of upland.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of adequate den sites may adversely affect cub survival and
   reproductive success in black bears (Ursus americanus). Management of
   remnant bear populations in the lower Mississippi floodplain
   necessitates understanding denning ecology. We monitored 23 radiotagged
   black bears for 33 den years from 1993 to 1995 in White River National
   Wildlife Refuge, Arkansas to investigate denning chronology and den
   requirements. Bears entered dens between 1 January-20 February and
   emerged between 12 March-28 April. Mean (+/-SE) denning duration was
   92.9 +/- 6.6 days and varied between sex-age classes (P = 0.002).
   Pregnant females denned longer (117.8 +/- 5.2 days, P = 0.029) than
   males and non-pregnant females (84.2 +/- 7.7 days). More than 44\% of
   the bears that denned (n = 27) used >1 den during a denning season, and
   one female used 4 dens. Most (90.2\%, n = 51) dens were elevated tree
   cavities with a hollow opening on the top or middle of the main trunk.
   Three species of trees were used with 77.8\% (n = 46) being overcup oak
   (Quercus lyrata). Basal area of trees greater than or equal to 10
   cmdiameter at breast height (dbh; P < 0.001) and number of stems greater
   than or equal to 84 cm dbh (P < 0.001; the min. dbh of den trees
   documented in this study) differed among vegetation plots with and
   without den trees. For seasonally flooded habitats, our results suggest
   the need for maintenance or augmentation of trees greater than or equal
   to 84 cm dbh to increase the number of potential dens and to enhance the
   quality of den microhabitat in the lower Mississippi alluvial Valley.}},

Abstract = {{We estimated survival for chicks within 59 northern bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus) broods using a modification of the Mayfield method that
   allows for brood mixing and intrabrood dependence. Broods were monitored
   during 1992-94 oil the Packsaddle Wildlife Management Area in western
   Oklahoma. Daily survival rates (DSR) were calculated for chicks reared
   by both female and male parents, chicks from hatching to 20 days old,
   chicks from 21 to 39 days old, chicks from hatching to 39 days old, by
   year, and pooled over years. Survival rates of brood mates were
   dependent on each other (P < 0.0001); therefore, the entire brood was
   the appropriate sampling unit for estimating variation associated with
   chick survival. Daily survival rate estimates for chicks in broods
   raised by females and males did not differ. Daily survival rates of
   chicks less than or equal to 20 days old were not significantly less
   than DSRs of chicks greater than or equal to 21 days old. No differences
   were observed among years for DSR of chicks pooled over sexes less than
   or equal to 20 days old or chicks greater than or equal to 21 days old
   (P = 0.9997). Chick DSR pooled over the entire brood-rearing period ((x)
   over bar = 39 days, SE = 4.1 days) did not differ among) ears for either
   ses or pooled over sexes. Survival estimates pooled over seu and years
   for chicks from hatching to 20 days old and from 21 to 39 days old were
   37.9 and 96.8\%. The estimate of chick survival pooled over sea and

Abstract = {{We determined contraceptive effectiveness and duration of effect after
   porcine zona pellucida (PZP) vaccination in free-roaming feral horses in
   Nevada. Mie captured, freeze-branded, treated and subsequently released
   132 adult feral mares. Treatment consisted of 1 or 2 injections (1 month
   apart) of vaccine emulsion consisting of aqueous PZP and Freund's
   complete adjuvant (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.; FCA; inj. 1) or Freund's
   incomplete adjuvant (FIA; inj. 2). We gave controls saline and Freund's
   adjuvant as above. Among 1-injection mares, we gave one group a single
   dose of raw antigen, and we gave the other group raw antigen plus a
   second dose of antigen sequestered in controlled-release microspheres.
   We also studied 63 untreated mares. We administered inoculations in
   December 1992, and monitored the mares via fecal analysis for pregnancy
   and via helicopter and ground survey for foal production through
   September 1994. We determined pregnancy via measurement of estrone
   sulfate, progesterone metabolites and total estrogens, in Fresh feces
   collected from the ground. Among antigen-treated mares, reproductive
   success across 1 year was 4.5\% (2-inj.), 20.0\% (l-inj. + microspheres)
   and 28.6\% (l-inj., no microspheres). Reproductive success in placebo
   (55.0\%) and untreated (53.9\%) mares was significantly greater than in
   treated groups. The following year, without further treatment,
   reproductive success was 44.0\% (e-inj.), and 54.5\% (untreated) and
   these values were not different. Data from other groups were
   insufficient for comparison. The results of this study confirm the
   feasibility of capturing large numbers of mares in the field for
   treatment and demonstrate: (1) 1-year contraceptive efficacy of several
   PZP vaccine protocols, (2) greater effectiveness in 2-injection
   protocols than in 1-injection protocols, and (3) a return to fertility
   in the second year after vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{During a 7-year study we monitored winter nutritional restriction of
   moose (Alces alccs) and moose numbers on Isle Royale (winters 1987-88 to
   1993-94). Over the 7 winters, the estimated moose population decreased
   26\% from an historic high of 1,653 (winter 1987-88) to 1,216 (1989-90),
   then increased to a new high (1,880 and 1,770) by winters 1992-93 and
   1993-94. During that time, there was a significant (P = 0.0486) negative
   relation (r = -0.84) between the percent of urine specimens collected
   from snow (snow-urine) in late winter with urea nitrogen:creatinine
   (UN:C) ratios greater than or equal to 3.5 mg:mg and percent change in
   the moose population from winter 1987-88. Mean urinary UN:C of moose
   residing on the east and west ends of Isle Royale declined (P less than
   or equal to 0.0001) among years; however, slopes of the 2 trends were
   different (P = 0.0001). The nutritional restriction and decline in moose
   numbers appeared to involve an epizootic of the winter tick (Dermacentor
   albipictus; indicated by percent moose observed with tick-induced hair
   breakage and loss). During winters 1987-88 to 1989-90, the percentage of
   late winter snow-urine specimens with UN:C ratios indicative of severe
   nutritional restriction ranged from 47 to 58\%; however, the percentage
   decreased to zero by winter 1993-94 as the tick infestation subsided and
   moose numbers increased.}},

Abstract = {{Cultures of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense Balech were
   subjected to conditions that induced two synchronized divisions over a
   period of 48 h. Before, during, and after this interval, toxin content,
   toxin composition, and several other physiological parameters were
   monitored every 2 h for 94 h. Toxin production was discontinuous,
   induced by light, and always occurred during a defined time frame within
   the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Specific toxin production rates were
   positive for a period of similar to 8-10 h in early G(1) and dropped to
   zero for the remainder of the interphase and mitosis. Analysis of toxin
   composition showed that cellular concentrations of all the saxitoxin
   derivatives followed a similar pattern of increase, stabilization, and
   decrease throughout one generation time. A putative sequence of
   interconversions between the derivatives could be established, with C2
   as the first compound to appear. Division of a subset of the population
   during the first 24 h of the experiment and the ensuing total synchrony
   of the culture suggest the existence of two transition points in the
   cell cycle of this dinoflagellate. The first transition point, at the
   beginning of G(1), is light-dependent and holds the cells in a G(0)-like
   period. The second block point at the end of G(1) is size-dependent and
   arrests the cells in G(1). We propose a model of the cell cycle of A.
   fundyense in which progression through the cell cycle can be arrested at
   two different transition points located in G(1) and toxin production is
   induced by light during G(1). The restriction of toxin production to a
   relatively short segment of the cell cycle provides a tool for comparing
   cells that are and are not synthesizing toxin.}},

   synchrony with unequal tide height and involvement of a light-response
   mechanism}},

Abstract = {{The circatidal rhythm of intertidal animals may reflect the inequality
   of the tides. In addition, a light-sensitive mechanism may be involved
   in their internal timing systems. To test these hypotheses, the larval
   release activity of the intertidal crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus was
   monitored under different light conditions in the laboratory. Under a
   24-h light-dark (LD) cycle with the phase similar to the field, the
   activity coincided with the times of high tide in the field and showed a
   tidal rhythm. This rhythm free-ran in constant, dim-light conditions,
   suggesting that the timing is controlled by an endogenous clock. When
   the population was exposed to a 24-h LD cycle with the phase changed
   from that in the field, the tidal rhythm was phase-shifted: while the
   light cycle advanced in phase from the field caused a phase-advance of
   the rhythm, that delayed in phase induced a phase-delay of the rhythm.
   Thus, a light-response mechanism is definitely involved in circatidal
   timing systems. But the population rhythm showed a large variability
   among individuals, associated with the phase-shift, and the magnitude of
   the phase-shift did not accurately correspond to that of the light
   cycle. These results suggest that the light-response system can control
   the phase of the rhythm less stronger than that in estuarine crabs. Most
   releases occurred at higher high tides, but the release of some females
   obviously occurred at lower high tides. The larval release pattern thus
   could not be accounted for by a simple synchrony with higher high tides.
   Hatching of H. sanguineus occurred after a `'hatching program'' of 49.5
   to 52.5 h. This program is initiated by some factor (hatching-program
   inducing stumuli: HPIS) transmitted from the female to the embryos. We
   speculated that this factor is effectively transmitted to the embryos
   when the habitat is exposed to air, i.e., at lower low-tide periods, and
   that once each embryo is stimulated, hatching occurs synchronously 2 d
   later during high tide. The release of HPIS is probably controlled by
   the circatidal clock of the female, and the 24-h LD cycle may
   participate in shifting this timing to the opposite low tide.}},

Abstract = {{Results of a 10-year study of lumbricid communities in Michigan's Upper
   Peninsula are reported. The objective of the investigation was to assess
   potential effects of Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) electromagnetic (EM)
   fields on lumbricid populations. The first 5 years (1984-88) were
   pre-operational, i.e., the ELF antenna which generated these EM fields
   had not yet been activated. During the last 5 years (1989-93), the
   antenna was operational at 76 Hz and 150 Amps. Lumbricid community data
   from the pre-operational period have been reported previously. Here,
   community and selected population parameters from the operational period
   are given in detail, together with summaries for the entire study
   period. In the Test site (adjacent to the ELF antenna), fluctuations in
   community diversity were relatively small; in the Control site (not
   subject to ELF influence), diversity increased steadily and
   significantly over the last 6 years of the study. Specific population
   responses to climatic patterns as well as long-term dynamics of
   non-dominant species were shown to underlie appreciable changes in
   community structure. Between-site comparisons in terms of potential EM
   field effects were suggested to be inappropriate, since community-level
   data (unlike species-specific data) lack the power to predict what the
   magnitude and nature of community composition and structure would have
   been in the absence of ELF EM field influence.}},

Abstract = {{Growth and adult survival rates were estimated for the endangered
   Colorado squaw-fish Ptychocheilus lucius inhabiting the upper Colorado
   River by using data from fish captured during 1990-1995. Mean annual
   growth rates of fish aged 3-6 years ranged from 32.2 (age 6) to 82.0
   (age 3) mm/year. Growth rates for older fish were highest for fish
   400-449 mm total length, TL, (42.7 mm/year) and declined to 19.8 mm/year
   for fish 500-549 mm TL. Fish 550 mm and longer grew an average 9.5
   mm/year. Survival rates for fish 550 mm and longer were estimated by
   comparing measured size distributions with simulated stable age and size
   distributions; these ranged from 0.83-0.87, with the best fit at 0.85.
   Though lack of historical data precludes comparisons with past growth
   and survival rates, our data serve as a baseline for future population
   monitoring efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable attention has been devoted to monitoring heavy metals in
   temperate zones of the world, largely due to the concentration of
   industries and populations in these regions. With increases in global
   transport of mercury, it has become important to examine the effects of
   mercury on components of tropical ecosystems, and to design
   biomonitoring schemes to assess environmental changes involving mercury.
   Tropical ecosystems differ from temperate ones in fundamental ways,
   including increased species diversity, and decreased niche width,
   spatial heterogeneity, food web lengths and complexity, productivity and
   soil laterization. Because of these differences, the fate and transport
   of mercury may differ in temperate and tropical systems, and it is
   suggested in this paper that bird feathers be used as a biomonitoring
   tool to assess broad-scale trends in mercury exposure, as well as being
   indicative of adverse effects on the birds themselves. In many
   ecosystems, some species of birds occupy top trophic levels. It is
   apparent that the mercury level in feathers of some tropical birds are
   as high as those from temperature regions, exceeding levels associated
   with adverse effects in laboratory studies.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site was established in
   southeastern Washington during the 1940s to produce plutonium, and the
   Pantex plant in Texas (used to load conventional ammunition shells and
   bombs) was rehabilitated in the 1950s to assemble nuclear weapons using
   the plutonium produced at Hanford. Current concentrations of airborne
   radionuclides around the perimeters of both sites are below applicable
   guidelines. Concentrations of radionuclides and nonradiological water
   quality in the Columbia River at Hanford and radiological and
   nonradiological water quality in the Ogallala Aquifer beneath the Pantex
   plant are also in compliance with applicable standards. Foodstuffs
   irrigated with river water downstream from Hanford show levels of
   radionuclides similar to those in foodstuffs from control areas. Levels
   of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in some on-site Hanford wildlife samples and
   concentrations of radionuclides in soils and vegetation on and off site
   at both locations are typical of naturally occurring radioactivity and
   worldwide fallout. The potential dose received by a maximally exposed
   individual at both sites in 1994 was less than or equal to 0.05 mrem;
   the average per capita dose was less than or equal to 0.002 mrem. By
   virtue of its size, restricted access, and conservative use of
   undeveloped land, the Hanford Site has become a sanctuary for plant and
   animal populations that have been eliminated from, or greatly reduced
   on, surrounding agricultural and range lands. The Hanford Reach of the
   Columbia River and its islands and the Pantex Plant with its playas
   serve as refuges for raptorial birds and migratory waterfowl. In
   addition, the Hanford Reach serves as a migration route for several
   species of salmon, and chinook salmon and steelhead trout spawn there.
   Bald eagles congregate along the Hanford Reach in the fall and winter to
   feed on the spawned-out carcasses of salmon and wintering waterfowl.}},

Abstract = {{Plumeless thistle is a European Asteraceae naturalized in Argentina,
   where it is a troublesome pasture and range weed. A European weevil
   (Rhinocyllus conicus) was imported for biocontrol of this thistle.
   Oviposition patterns, egg to adult survival, and the weevil's effect on
   the production of achenes by thistles were monitored over 2 yr. The
   oviposition period did not begin simultaneously in all thistle
   populations, but finished in late November. Egg to Larvae survival was
   63\% and egg to adult survival was approximately 50\%. No important egg
   predators were detected. The weevils destroyed 80\% of the propagules
   per capitulum and showed a slight tendency to adapt to the plumeless
   thistle cycle.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the growth, development, and survivorship of Chirixalus
   eiffingeri tadpoles in 2 bamboo tree habitats at the Experimental Forest
   of National Taiwan University at Chitou from July to October 1994. We
   found 13 egg clutches in bamboo stumps of which 3 were deposited in
   stumps already containing tadpoles. We monitored the number and total
   length (TL) of all tadpoles in the water pool of every nest until no
   tadpoles were left. The number of post-hatching tadpoles found in pools
   was not correlated with clutch size. The survival rate of tadpoles
   before Gosner stage 30 varied widely and was not correlated with initial
   tadpole number. The decrease in the number of tadpoles may have been due
   to starvation, cannibalism, and/or predation. Tadpoles that did not
   receive trophic eggs failed to grow and develop, suggesting the
   importance of brood care. The growth and development of tadpoles were
   not correlated with initial tadpole density. The presence of tadpoles
   from an earlier clutch strongly affected the growth and development of
   tadpoles from a later clutch, but the mechanism(s) of interaction
   between the 2 cohorts of tadpoles has yet to be resolved.}},

Abstract = {{Polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci were used to characterize
   genetic variation in contemporary and historic populations of the San
   Clemente Island loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus mearnsi), an
   endangered bird with a current population of about 30 individuals, that
   is endemic to one of the California Channel Islands. We also compared
   the population of the shrike with two contemporary populations of the
   still abundant subspecies, L. l. gambeli, which live 120 km away on the
   adjacent mainland. The current population of L. l. mearnsi has 60 \% of
   the genetic variation of the mainland shrike populations and is strongly
   differentiated from them. Comparison of living birds with 19 birds
   collected in 1915 shows that most of the variation within the island
   population was lost before the recent 90\% decline in population size,
   and the 20 \% decrease in variation this century is probably
   attributable to genetic drift. Mitochondrial DNA control region sequence
   data from 80-year-old specimens show that there may have been limited
   introgression to L. l. mearnsi, this century, from another island
   subspecies, L. l. anthonyi, found in the northern Channel Islands.
   Today, gene flow between L. l. mearnsi and mainland L. l. gambeli is
   very low, even though a few mainland birds visit the island annually.
   The island subspecies population has evolved sufficient genetic
   independence to justify ongoing conservation efforts to counter
   demographic collapse and genetic erosion; the course of genetic erosion
   can now be monitored noninvasively, as demonstrated by this study, based
   on DNA amplified from feathers.}},

Abstract = {{A reliable and sensitive graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry
   (GFAAS) method with Zeeman background correction was developed for the
   analysis of aluminium in serum and urine in the biological monitoring of
   aluminium exposure. The method is based on platform atomisation in
   pyrolytically coated graphite tubes after fourfold dilution with nitric
   acid. For serum analysis, a matrix matched standard curve is prepared
   and for urine the method of standard additions is used. The within-run
   imprecision (C.V.) for serum and urine was 3\% and 5\%, and the
   between-day imprecision, 6\% and 7.2\%, at a concentration level of 4.0
   mu mol/l. The between-day imprecision for urinary aluminium was 15.7\%
   at a concentration level of 0.24 mu mol/l. The detection limits were
   0.02 mu mol/l for serum and 0.07 mu mol/l for urine. During 1 year of
   participation in TEQAS external quality assessment scheme of the Robens
   Institute for Health and Safety (Guildford, UK) for serum aluminium the
   maximum cumulative performance score was achieved. For urinary aluminium
   a certificate in the external quality control scheme of the German
   Society of Occupational Medicine was obtained. The mean concentration of
   aluminium in a non-exposed population, who did not use antacid drugs,
   was 0.06 mu mol/l (S.D. 0.03, range 0.02-0.13, n = 21) in serum, and
   0.33 mu mol/l (S.D. 0.18, range 0.07-0.82, n = 44) in urine. The upper
   reference limit for aluminium in a healthy, non-exposed population was
   estimated to be 0.1 mu mol/l in serum and 0.6 mu mol/l in urine. (C)

Abstract = {{In an area of China, not previously studied in detail concerning cadmium
   pollution and possible adverse effects on the kidney of exposed
   populations, concentrations of cadmium in urine as an indicator of renal
   accumulation of cadmium was studied and related to indicators of renal
   dysfunction in order to examine if a relationship could be documented.
   Cadmium concentrations in urine were analysed by graphite furnace atomic
   absorption spectrometry and urinary beta-2 microglobulin (UBM) and
   albumin (UALB) were measured as indicators of renal dysfunction. Rice
   samples and urine samples were obtained from three areas in Zhejiang
   province, China, representing a highly exposed area, a medium exposed
   area and a control area, respectively Cadmium concentrations in rice
   were 3.70, 0.51 and 0.072 mg/kg for the heavily, medium polluted areas
   and the control area, respectively. Cadmium concentrations in urine
   (geometric means) were 10.7, 1.62 and 0.40 mu g/l in the high, medium
   and control areas respectively. There was a clear increase in UBM and
   UALB in the heavily exposed group in comparison to the control group and
   a slight increase in the medium exposed group. There was a statistically
   significant dose-response relationship between cadmium in urine and
   beta(2)-microglobulin excretion in urine, which is similar to what has
   previously been reported in other countries. The findings constitute the
   first report concerning a dose-response relationship in this population
   group in Zhejiang province in China. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{During 6 successive wintering periods, 727 common guillemots Uria aalge
   were recovered from Belgian beaches. One-third of the birds were already
   dead; the rest passed through rehabilitation centres where they
   eventually died. All birds were monitored for general condition (body
   mass, fat reserves), eventual status of oiling and pathological changes
   (cachexia, acute hemorrhagic gastroenteropathy); 339 birds were sampled
   for trace metals (total and organic Hg, Cu, Zn, Fe, Cd) and PCB
   (polychlorinated biphenyl) analysis. Oiling is still a major cause of
   death for wintering pelagic seabirds: half of the birds showed signs of
   external or internal oiling, probably a still greater number of oiled
   birds never reach the shores. Although a low body mass can be considered
   a normal winter condition for wintering guillemots, pathology results
   showed that three-quarters of the studied animals were in a state of
   cachexia with emaciated pectoral muscle and lowered muscle lipid
   content. Elevated levels of Cu, Zn, Hg and PCBs were linked to the state
   of cachexia and may well represent an additional stress factor leading
   to the debilitation and death of part of the wintering guillemot
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Pomacentrus amboinensis Bleeker and Dascyllus aruanus (L.) exhibit
   similar large scale patterns in recruitment to One Tree lagoon, southern
   Great Barrier Reef. They recruit in greatest numbers near the windward
   perimeter compared with the centre of the lagoon, and at the perimeter,
   recruit preferentially to deeper sites (4-8 m depth). This pattern was
   observed in recruitment to standard coral heads of Pocillopora
   damicornis (L.), a preferred substratum transplanted to a range of
   locations and depths. As substratum was held constant, spatial variation
   in recruitment was not determined by the availability of suitable
   habitat. Patterns in growth and mortality of the two fish species were
   monitored for juveniles transplanted to another set of standard coral
   heads, in order to determine whether post-recruitment processes would
   reinforce or disrupt patterns established at the time of recruitment.
   The two species exhibited contrasting patterns. Pomacentrus amboinensis
   exhibited faster growth and better survivorship at deeper sites,
   regardless of the location in the lagoon, reinforcing the initial
   pattern. Dascyllus aruanus exhibited faster growth at perimeter sites
   and significantly better survivorship at central sites, patterns that
   would tend to disrupt the initial pattern. Within locations, individuals
   exhibiting slower growth rates (Pomacentrus amboinensis) or smaller
   initial size (Dascyllus aruanus) had reduced life expectancy. The
   results suggest that location selection by settlers of Pomacentrus
   amboinensis results in improved growth and/or survival. This was not the
   case for Dascyllus aruanus, which is probably more influenced by the
   presence of conspecifics. However, even for Pomacentrus amboinensis,
   large-scale patterns probably reflect constraints on habitat selection.
   Recruitment in Pomacentrus amboinensis was consistently lower to sites
   immediately down current of other reefs, regardless of their position. I
   suggest that the absence of recruits of both species to central sites
   indicates that this region is a recruitment-shadow. Juveniles settle in
   preferred habitat at the first opportunity after entering the lagoon,
   leaving much of the preferred habitat in the centre of the lagoon
   unoccupied. Patterns are initially recruitment-determined, but either
   reinforcement or disruption mean that the numerical abundance of adults
   cannot be predicted on the basis of recruitment data alone. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Fishes, large invertebrates and macroalgae inside four marine reserves
   and at associated external reference sites off the eastern Tasmanian
   coast were censused between 1992 and 1993 shortly after the declaration
   of the reserves. Changes in several population parameters during the
   first year of protection in the largest Maria Island Marine Reserve were
   examined using two different ANOVA designs. The densities of rock
   lobsters and sea urchins and the mean sizes of wrasse, leatherjackets,
   abalone and rock lobsters all increased within the reserve relative to
   outside over the first year; however, only the increases in density of
   sea urchins and mean abalone size were statistically significant at the
   5\% level. The census methodology and statistical techniques
   nevertheless were considered sufficiently sensitive to reveal any long
   term change following future censuses. A doubling in population numbers
   of most large fishes and invertebrates, or a 10\% increase in the mean
   size of animals, is required to indicate that significant change has
   occurred. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the age of animals in the field using tooth wear criteria may be subject

   characteristics are lacking. Nineteen leopards in Namibia were assessed
   for tooth eruption and wear. Between 1991 and 1995 leopards (including
   13 individuals of known age) were monitored at one year intervals ('28
   leopard years') to record age and tooth wear. At the age of two years
   leopards had fully developed dentition. Wear started with the incisors
   and canines, and spread to the premolars and molars. A chronology of
   tooth eruption and wear in relation to age is presented. Above the age
   of three years, male leopards showed higher frequencies of enamel
   flaking and canine fractures than females.}},

Abstract = {{1. Faced with the prospect of dealing with several hundred or even
   thousands of habitat sites, environmental managers in dense pond
   landscapes often have insufficient information.
   2. In addition, there is a need to treat Fond habitats as a totality, in
   that the intervening terrestrial matrix is relevant to the distribution
   and persistence of certain species.
   3. Part of the terrestrial matrix is concerned with the spatial
   distribution of ponds and their `connectedness', termed here
   `pondscape'.
   4. An initial approach to delineating `pondscape' is demonstrated. Such
   delineation enables environmental managers not only to conceptualize
   core areas of pond habitat, but also to trace changes in spatial extent
   and form, and to predict (and where necessary mitigate) changes arising
   from proposed development.
   5. Though the approach is in part an abstraction, it also provides the
   advantages of synoptic description, monitoring and planning evaluation.

Abstract = {{The current geographical distribution of the Mediterranean monk seal
   Monachus monachus colony inhabiting the Cabo Blanco peninsula (Western
   Sahara-Mauritania) is described. Its distribution range has apparently
   not changed since surveys conducted in 1984-88. Sightings of adults on
   the Tarf el Guerguerat coast, 20 km north of the known breeding caves,
   suggests the existence of other possible breeding groups further north.
   Two caves used by the seals are described for the first time, A review
   of historical trends in cave occupation by seals made it possible (I) to
   locate the so-called `maternity cave', last reported in 1949, and (2) to
   establish that the colony, since its discovery, has occupied at least
   eight caves, five of which have collapsed. An index of population size
   based on counts of individuals of identified morphological types
   indicates that, during 1993-94, the colony was composed of c.113-165
   individuals (excluding pups), a larger number than previously assumed.
   Counting of seals at times of maximum haul-out is proposed as a tool to
   monitor population trends, although it is considered unreliable for
   estimating absolute numbers. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing accomplishment of management objectives related to ecosystem
   health requires monitoring key indicators, including ecological
   processes and components of biological diversity. For these purposes, a
   monitoring plan was developed on the Chequamegon National Forest. It was
   refined by use of public workshops and technical consultation, and later
   adjusted based on practicality and additional inventory needs. To date,
   monitoring has focused on plants and birds, including long-term baseline
   monitoring in both managed forest and more natural areas. Monitoring is
   done at both the national forest and the ranger district levels, a
   forest subunit, the latter usually focusing on specific projects rather
   than forest-wide ecosystem health concerns. Examples from the Laurentian
   ranger district of the Superior National Forest are provided. Future
   assessments will require qualitative, quantitative and spatial analyses
   of community, ecosystem, habitat and population trends and patterns, and
   management effects. An institutionalized program that focuses on key
   ecosystem components at various scales, and that involves concerned
   publics and many partners: will be necessary to provide feedback to
   refine forest management. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focusses on the survivorship pattern of seedlings of Rumex
   obtusifolius L. in the irrigated alfalfa crops (Medicago sativa L.) in
   central Catalonia (NE Spain). The relationship between this pattern and
   seasonal environmental change was evaluated by monitoring seedling
   cohorts that had germinated at different times of the year for 31
   months. Paired comparisons of cohort survivorship curves were performed
   over their life-spans and for their coexistence period, using Peto and
   Peto's log rank test. The significance of intrinsic variables such as
   age and size in determining seedling survival was tested using
   hierarchical log-linear analysis applied on a three-way contingency
   table and by means of Goodman and Kruskal's association coefficients.
   Results showed that seedling cohorts emerging at different times in the
   year exhibited a similar Deevey type III survivorship pattern.
   Therefore, survivorship was scarcely affected by seasonal environmental
   variation. However, since age had little effect on seedling survival
   compared with size, this age-specific survivorship pattern was, in fact,
   a consequence of both size-dependent mortality and changes in size
   distribution with age. In the first weeks of life, cohort size
   distribution was greatly skewed to the smallest classes, with the
   highest mortality rates, and therefore the risk of death in the cohort
   was high. Afterwards, the frequency of the largest size classes
   increased with age, thus reducing the risk of death of the cohort.}},

Abstract = {{Grain yield losses due to the smuts are currently controlled by the
   application of fungicides to seed and by the use of resistant cultivars.
   It is important to monitor the natural populations of the six species of
   cereal smut that affect barley, oat, and wheat to ensure early detection
   of resistance to fungicides and potentially threatening changes in
   virulence. Surveys were conducted in farm fields in Manitoba and
   Saskatchewan from 1989 to 1995 to detect changes in the incidence and
   severity of these cereal smuts and to make collections that could be
   screened for carbathiin resistance and virulence. The percentage of
   fields of barley affected by smuts ranged from 51\% in 1992 to 82\% in
   1995, with the mean percentage of infected plants and thus grain yield
   losses (with smut diseases of cereals, the percentage of infected plants
   equates to the percent yield loss) ranging from 0.2\% in 1991 to 0.8\%
   in 1989. In oat, the percentage of fields affected by smuts ranged from
   2\% in 1994 to 23\% in 1992, with means of 0.1\% or fewer infected
   plants. The percentage of common bread wheat fields affected varied from
   6\% in 1989 to 36\% in 1995 with means of 0.1\% or fewer infected
   plants. Durum wheats are generally more susceptible and the percentage
   of fields affected varied from 45\% in 1994 to 78\% in 1995, with the
   mean level of infected plants per field ranging from <0.1 to 0.4\%. Mean
   levels of infection of barley, oat, and wheat have declined from 1982-88
   levels. None of the more than 1100 collections of the six species of
   smut from 1989 to 1995 were resistant to carbathiin. The frequency of
   Ustilago nuda collections virulent on barley cv. Conquest remains high
   at 41-89\%, indicating that genes Un3 and Un6 are of little value now.
   None of the collections were virulent on line CI 13662, which contains
   the gene Un8 now being incorporated into Canadian cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Movements of nine young beavers (Castor fiber) that were trapped at the
   front of an expanding population were monitored using radiotelemetry.
   Two years is generally considered the normal age at dispersal in
   beavers, but in this study the ages at dispersal were evenly distributed
   between 11 and 23 months. At least one of the females in the study gave
   birth at 2 years of age. Exploratory movements of three individuals
   outside the natal terrritory before the time of dispersal were observed.
   The observed plasticity in age at dispersal and parturition indicates
   that the rate of increase may be greater than expected at the front of
   expanding beaver populations.}},

Abstract = {{Captive rearing for release back into the wild is considered a useful
   management tool for endangered species because it can potentially
   increase the rate of recruitment by bypassing the early, high-risk
   stages in an individual's life history. In evaluating the benefits of
   captive rearing to conservation, it is important to monitor the survival
   rate of animals after release, to be sure that they have the skills
   necessary for survival in the wild. Using radio telemetry, we compared
   the movement and survival of captive-reared Takabe (Porphyrio mantelli),
   a large flightless rail endemic to New Zealand, to wild-reared Takabe in
   the rugged mountains of Fiordland over a 5-year period. The results
   indicated that captive-reared birds survived at least as well as
   wild-reared birds. Survival of wild-reared Takabe up to 1 year of age,
   which is prior to the release of captive-reared birds, was poor over two
   winters marked by particularly cold temperatures, which made the
   benefits of captive rearing more pronounced. Differences in post-release
   movements and habitat selection of the two groups did not have a
   detrimental effect on survival rate of captive-reared females versus
   males, eight out of nine (89\%) surviving females have formed pairs
   since their release compared with only two of eight (25\%) males. This
   unexpected result suggests there may be a shortage of females in the
   wild population. We conclude that captive rearing for release back into
   the wild increases the adult Takabe population in Fiordland.}},

Abstract = {{Longitudinal studies of survival are valuable because age-specific
   survival affects population dynamics and the evolution of several life
   history traits. We used capture-mark-recapture models to assess the
   relationship between survival and sex, age, population, year of study,
   disease, winter weather, and population density in two populations of
   bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in Alberta, Canada. The Ram Mountain
   population, monitored for 20 yr, more than doubled in density; the Sheep
   River population, monitored for 13 yr, experienced a pneumonia
   epizootic. Yearling survival varied among years and was lower than that
   of older sheep of the same sex, except for yearling males at Ram
   Mountain. Yearling females at Ram Mountain were the only sex-age class
   exhibiting density dependence in survival. Senescence was evident for
   both sexes in both populations. Female survival from age 2 to age 7 was
   very high in both populations, but males aged 2 and 3 yr enjoyed better
   survival than males aged 4-6 yr. Our data support the suggestion that
   where hunters remove many males older than 5 yr of age, the natural
   mortality of males increases at 3-5 yr, possibly because young males
   suffer a mortality cost of participating in rutting activity. The
   decline in survival for sheep older than 7 yr was greater for males than
   for females. Survival was lower for males than for females, both among
   prime-aged sheep (0.896 vs. 0.939 at Sheep River; 0.837 vs. 0.945 at Ram
   Mountain) and among older sheep (0.777 vs. 0.859 at Sheep River; 0.624
   vs. 0.850 at Ram Mountain), but not among yearlings. Survival of sheep
   aged 2-7 yr was not significantly different between the two populations.
   Winter weather did not affect survival. Survival of sheep 2 yr of age
   and older did not vary significantly between years, except at Sheep
   River where survival of prime-aged sheep of both sexes was lower in the
   year of the pneumonia epizootic. Studies of survival of mountain sheep
   based upon skull collections may have overestimated survival of young
   rams. Our results underline the need for accurate information on
   age-specific survival.}},

Abstract = {{Implicit in past studies of recruitment is the assumption that all new
   recruits possess the same capacity for juvenile growth, and that
   observed variation in juvenile growth and survival is due entirely to
   spatial and temporal variation in food availability, magnitude of
   physical stresses, and intensity of competition and predation. We set
   out to determine if daily larval cohorts of the barnacle Semibalanus
   balanoides differ in mean physiological quality and, therefore, in their
   potential for recruiting to adult populations. To assess larval
   physiological quality, we measured the organic content of nonfeeding
   cyprid larvae attaching on five dates (10-15 d intervals) during the
   1995 recruitment season. Juvenile physiological quality was determined
   by monitoring the growth, under controlled laboratory conditions, of
   individuals attaching on seven dates (3-15 d intervals) during the same
   season. Both cyprid organic content and juvenile growth capacity
   differed significantly among daily cohorts. We suggest that variation in
   cyprid organic content may explain previous observations of temporal
   variation in cyprid metamorphic success and early juvenile mortality and
   further suggest that variation in juvenile growth capacity contributes
   to differences in recruitment success of daily cohorts.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective is to present a perspective on large-scale natural
   resource monitoring when cause-effect is a potential issue. We believe
   that the approach of designing a survey to meet traditional commodity
   production and resource state descriptive objectives is too restrictive
   and unnecessarily limits the ability to investigate cause-effect issues.
   We only consider terrestrial natural resources, focusing on forests and
   rangeland.
   A large institutionalized programme is required to establish
   cause-effect relationships when monitoring terrestrial resources. This
   is justified based on the growing concerns about our natural resources.
   A long-term Vision of a desirable future terrestrial monitoring system,
   realizing that it is not clear yet what key variables should be
   measured, will increase the chances that decisions on current designs
   will ultimately lead to better systems in the future.
   We propose a pronounced shift in the designs applied to forest and
   range, specifically, the National Resources Inventory (NRI), the Forest
   Inventory and Analysis (FIA), and the Forest Health Monitoring (FHM)
   programmes. The designs must not only address simple status and trends
   estimation but also give emphasis to identifying interesting changes
   occurring in the sampled populations thus facilitating identification
   and establishment of possible cause-effect relationships. We propose an
   integrated design consisting of a large-scale, long-term ongoing survey
   as the core design accompanied by supplemental experimental design
   studies or analytic survey. Continuous inventory involving annual
   measurement of a subset of the sample from selected populations should
   be implemented: inventorying a population every five years (as with NRI)
   or every ten years (as with FIA) is insufficient. FHM, FIA, and NRI
   should collect a subset of variables in common. Complementarity of data
   collected would make it more likely to identify promising cause-effect
   relationships for a wider range of resource variables. At this stage we
   recommend focusing an the mortality of trees, shrubs, forbs, and grasses
   as the key indicator of forest and range health. Mortality is
   objectively measurable and can often be detected by remote sensing. When
   possible, follow-up observational studies to document cause-effect
   relationships should be limited to public lands because of concern of
   infringing on the personal rights of landowners. This may not be
   possible if unrepresentative populations result because of this. If
   studies are designed properly, we could achieve our objectives yet tie
   such studies to current natural resource inventory systems.}},

Abstract = {{Despite steady injection of public funds by successive administrations,
   the Canadian fishery industry is characterized by resource depletion,
   vessel tie-ups, and overcapacity, which have led to plant closures and
   rising unemployment. This paper assesses the progress Canadian marine
   policies have been making towards rational use and conservation of
   fisheries and promotion of employment and economic development in
   fishing communities since 1977.
   The analysis begins with the creation of the 200-mile exclusive economic
   zone (EEZ) and its rationale in the United Nations Convention on the Law
   of the Sea (UNCLOS), namely conservation. State subsidies for fleet
   upgrading, industry modernization, marketing, and the introduction of
   quota systems, such as the individual transferable quotas (ITQs) and
   enterprise quotas (EQs), are identified as the key policy initiatives
   which might realize an economically-viable fishing industry in the
   post-1977 period. These policies produced corporate expansion and
   prosperity in the mid-1980s, but there followed corporate losses because
   of Canadian over-dependence on American markets and sharp quota cuts.
   With regard to conservation, shortcomings are identified in the virtual
   population analysis model (VPA), and the inability of the Department of
   Fisheries to monitor fishing effort by domestic and foreign vessels. The
   need for radical change in the future direction of marine policies is
   emphasized and arguments made which support the following objectives:
   elimination of ecologically-harmful fishing technologies; use of
   community quotas (with a modified individual quota system);
   strengthening of community management systems and development of
   comanagement approaches to fisheries management, involving government
   and fishing communities.}},

   conducted in Fargo, ND, in 1993, 1994, and 1995 to examine the seasonal
   population changes of P. xylostella in the crop host, crambe, Crambe
   abyssinica Hochst. ex R. E. Fries, and the weed host, field pennycress,
   Thlaspi arvense L. The abundance of adults was measured using pheromone
   traps and by flusing them from vegetation. The 1st peak in adult density
   was observed in the weed host and the subsequent peaks in the crop were
   recorded at approximate to 300 DD (base 7.5 degrees C) intervals. In
   1993, these peak flights occurred in early to mid-June and July; in 1994
   in early to mid-June, mid-July, and mid- to late August; and in 1995 at
   end of June, mid-July, early to mid-August, and early September. The sex
   ratio based on larval collections was approximate to 1:1. There was a
   strong relationship between the egg density and visual counts of flushed
   adults. From the comparison of phenology of the crop host and P.
   xylostella, the 1st-generation larvae may be injurious if the crop is
   planted early and no weeds are available to ovipositing females near the
   crop. The larvae present in the 2nd half of July may potentially injure
   the ripening crop.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the whitefly Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Perring
   were studied at a mixed-crop organic farm on Pine Island, FL, between
   September 1992 and January 1993. Whitefly populations on tomato,
   eggplant, zucchini, cucumber; and pepper were monitored weekly by
   beat-pan sampling and biweekly by visual counts, and parasitism was
   determined by rearing parasitoids from whitefly infested tomato and
   eggplant foliage, Analysis of the sampling data identified tomato and
   eggplant as the most attractive whitely host plants followed by
   cucumber, zucchini, and pepper. Parasitism of whiteflies on tomato and
   eggplant reached 80\% during the study. Two peaks in population numbers
   were observed on tomato and eggplant planted by late September, whereas
   only 1 peak occurred when the same crops were planted later. The
   suitability of a spatially explicit population model as a tool for
   investigating insect dynamics was demonstrated on whiteflies at the
   farm. Simulation experiments conducted to explain the trends in whitefly
   population numbers observed on early and late tomato indicated that
   these population peaks likely resulted from the interaction of planting
   date and temperature and not from the spatial heterogeneity of the crop
   system at the farm. Other simulation experiments showed that whitely
   population levels could be lowered by grouping similar crops and
   maintaining barriers to whitefly movement between crops. The utility; of
   this type of model for studying insect dynamics in systems where host
   plants vary spatially and temporally is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to assess variations in physico-chemical
   characteristics of water of the springs located within the boundary of a
   Central Himalayan town where the springwater is used for drinking
   purposes. Monitoring of 12 springs was carried out for three seasons
   (winter, summer and monsoon). The results indicate direct influence of
   unplanned sewage disposal on the springwater quality as reflected by
   significant regional variations in the concentration of nitrates,
   chlorides, sulfates, sulfides and electrical conductivity. Population
   density varies within the town from 3110 to 14137 persons/km(-2) and has
   direct relationship with water quality. Springs located in the densely
   populated area had higher concentrations of all these compounds.
   Concentrations of nitrates up to 60 ppm were observed in some springs,
   making water unsuitable for human consumption. No significant changes
   were observed in springwater quality during different seasons.}},

Abstract = {{For centuries, several hundred pesticides have been used to control
   insects. These pesticides differ greatly in their mode of action, uptake
   by the body, metabolism, elimination from the body, and toxicity to
   humans. Potential exposure from the environment can be estimated by
   environmental monitoring. Actual exposure (uptake) is measured by the
   biological monitoring of human tissues and body fluids. Biomarkers are
   used to detect the effects of pesticides before adverse clinical health
   effects occur. Pesticides and their metabolites are measured in
   biological samples, serum, fat, urine, blood, or breast milk by the
   usual analytical techniques. Biochemical responses to environmental
   chemicals provide a measure of toxic effect. A widely used biochemical
   biomarker, cholinesterase depression, measures exposure to
   organophosphorus insecticides. Techniques that measure DNA damage (e.g.,
   detection of DNA adducts) provide a powerful tool in measuring
   environmental effects. Adducts to hemoglobin have been detected with
   several pesticides. Determination of chromosomal aberration rates in
   cultured lymphocytes is an established method of monitoring populations
   occupationally or environmentally exposed to known or suspected
   mutagenic-carcinogenic agents. There are several studies on the
   cytogenetic effects of work with pesticide formulations. The majority of
   these studies report increases in the frequency of chromosomal
   aberrations and/or sister chromatid exchanges among the exposed workers.
   Biomarkers will have a major impact on the study of environmental risk
   factors. The basic aim of scientists exploring these issues is to
   determine the nature and consequences of genetic change or variation,
   with the ultimate purpose of predicting or preventing disease.}},

Abstract = {{This article reviews the literature on the application of methods for
   the detection of growth factors, oncogene proteins, and tumor-suppressor
   gene proteins in the blood of humans with cancer or who are at risk for
   the development of cancer. The research summarized here suggests that
   many of these biomarker assays can be used to distinguish between
   diseased and nondiseased slates and in some instances may be able to
   predict susceptibility for future disease. Thus, these biomarkers could
   be valuable tools for monitoring at-risk populations for purposes of
   disease prevention and control.}},

Abstract = {{Bioremediation is becoming an accepted treatment option for the
   remediation of petroleum-contaminated sites. Instrumental in
   implementing bioremediation is the characterization of bacteria capable
   of degrading the contaminants of interest. A wide variety of techniques
   have been reported in the literature but they often involve volatile
   solvents or petroleum mixtures as substrates and thus are difficult to
   use. Standard heterotrophic plate counts are often required by
   environmental regulations to be included as part of contaminated site
   investigations and assessments. Standard heterotrophic plate count
   techniques were found in this study to be unable to detect changes in
   population sizes in contaminated and uncontaminated soils. A more
   specific assay using benzoate, a metabolite of many BTEX compounds, was
   also used. This technique was capable of detecting differences in
   population size between contaminated and uncontaminated soils and
   benzoate is thus a better substrate to use when characterizing
   petroleum-contaminated soils. Furthermore, the data (population size vs,
   contaminant concentration) fit a hyperbolic model well. Such a model
   could be used to monitor population size with respect to contaminant
   concentration as well as population size outside the contaminant plume
   to further assess the progress of bioremediation at a contaminated site.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a new method for monitoring pests over a growing season and
   applied the method to monitoring the European red spider mite
   (Panonychus ulmi Koch) in apples. We evaluated the performance of the
   monitoring method in this system by simulation experiments and a field
   test in 28 orchard blocks in New York State, USA in 1995. The method is
   based on serially linking sample occasions (bouts) in time. At each
   sample bout, the monitoring procedure decides between intervening or not
   intervening. In the case of no intervention, the procedure schedules the
   next sample bout on the basis of an estimate of the current density, a
   descriptive population growth model (exponential for mites) and
   intervention thresholds. The next sample bout is scheduled when the risk
   of the pest density becoming greater than a future intervention
   threshold exceeds a specified tolerance. The name of the sampling method
   reflects this adaptiveness of the sampling frequency. The sampling
   protocol is constructed by combining a sequential probability ratio test
   for taking time-efficient invervention decisions at high density with a
   fixed sample size estimation at low density. The low-density estimates
   are used for calculating the waiting times until the next sample. The
   probabilities of the intervene or wait decisions and the expected sample
   sizes for these sampling protocols were calculated as functions of the
   pest density by Monte Carlo simulation. The expected performance
   characteristics of the monitoring method for a given population
   trajectory are estimated by integrating the performance criteria of the
   sampling protocols over a population trajectory. We simulated the
   performance of the monitoring method for two sets of 400 simulated
   population trajectories. The trajectories were calculated with an
   exponential polynomial equation with random parameters. The trajectories
   in the first set were characterized by low growth rates and a maximum
   density below the intervention threshold while the trajectories in the
   other set had high growth rates and a maximum density above the
   threshold. As performance criteria we used the probability of
   intervening the number of scheduled sample bouts, the total number of
   sample units, the cumulative mite density per leaf (mite days) and the
   mite density at the time of intervention. Simulation indicated that the
   adaptive frequency classification would have similar performance
   characteristics to existing monitoring methods when monitoring rapidly
   growing populations, while substantial savings on the number of sample
   bouts would be expected with slowly growing populations. The field test
   confirmed these predictions and demonstrated the savings on sample bouts
   that are obtained by using the adaptive frequency classification.}},

Abstract = {{Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region was used to compare the genetic
   diversity of 5 strains of red sea bream Pagrus major. Composite
   haplotypes, representing the information from 6 restriction
   endonucleases, were generated for samples of 35-40 fish from each
   strain. The components of haplotypes in the cultured strains differed
   considerably from those of the natural population. This is remarkable
   from the point of view of haplotype specialization. The results of a
   chi-square randomization test, in which differences between the strains
   were very significant, also showed that the specializations of haplotype
   were accelerated. Haplotypes occurred at a rate of 0.11 to 0.29 in the
   cultured strains, and 0.33 in the natural population. Haplotypic
   diversities were 0.34 to 0.84 in the cultured strains, and 0.86 in the
   natural population. The UPGMA clustering, based on pure mean nucleotide
   sequence divergence, differed entirely from the UPGMA clustering based
   on the allozyme genetic distance. For this reason, it is thought that
   RFLP analysis of the mtDNA D-loop region could sensitively detect the
   bottleneck effect caused by a decrease in the effective number of
   parents. The pure mean nucleotide sequence divergences between the
   cultured strains were wider (17 times) and higher (29 times) than the
   values between the natural population. Thus, RFLP analysis of the mtDNA
   D-loop region was thought to be a good method for monitoring the genetic
   changes that occur during selective breeding.}},

   1993-1995. Samples were taken monthly during the spring, summer, and
   autumn months from 3 discrete habitats: citrus groves, improved
   pastures, and weedy margins of irrigation ditches. The grasshopper
   species assemblage at the Research Center consisted of 16 species in the
   family Acrididae, 7 species in the family Tettigoniidae, and 3 species
   in the family Tetrigidae. Family and species dominance varied among
   habitats. Grasshopper abundance was highest in citrus groves and ditch
   margins, and these habitats had proportionally more acridids. Pastures
   were inhabited by fewer grasshoppers, and were dominated by
   tettigoniids. The nymphal tettigoniid population was relatively high,
   and adult population relatively low in pastures. Tetrigids were
   infrequent in all habitats. The most abundant grasshoppers were
   Dichromorpha viridis (Scudder) and Conocephalus fasciatus (DeGeer),
   grass-feeding species that were abundant in all habitats sampled.
   Collection of Melanoplus bispinosus Scudder is a new state record.
   Potential effects of grasshoppers and land management on avifauna are

Abstract = {{1. In dense populations of the saxicolous lichen Lasallia pustulata the
   margins of adjacent thalli overlap each other in intraspecific
   competition for space and light,
   2. In situ non-destructive monitoring of hydration-dependent potential
   photosynthetic activity by modulated fluorescence systems in different
   parts of the thallus shows that the activity is structured by a
   centre-to-margin gradient, with the centre of the thallus remaining
   active for substantially longer periods than the margins when the thalli
   dry up after being activated by wetting. The pattern reflects the water
   status of different parts of the thallus: the margins which are thin and
   exposed dry up first,
   3. The activity pattern within individual lichen thalli suggests that
   marginal overlapping between neighbours may have a less detrimental
   effect on the shadowed individuals than expected from a pure
   consideration of the amount of area shadowed, Because the centre of the
   lichen thallus is active for longer periods, shadowing of this region
   may possibly be more harmful per area unit than an overlap at the less
   active margins.
   4. Larger thalli are active for substantially longer periods than small
   ones, Even the margins of larger thalli tend to be active for a longer
   period than the centre of small thalli.}},

Abstract = {{The first tilapias used in aquaculture in Africa were Tilapia rendalli
   and Oreochromis mossambicus, species which proved to be of little
   aquacultural value. Now interest is focusing on a small number of more
   productive species, mainly O. niloticus and O. aureus. The choice of
   strains has been often fortuitous, conditioned by proximity of supply or
   based on transfers from countries or stations where research had been
   accomplished. in this framework, the enhancement of research dealing
   with local species or populations for aquaculture as well as monitoring
   of the genetic characteristics of the main cultivated populations
   appears to be essential. Rational management of broodstock is the recent
   result of biochemical techniques for evaluating genetic variability and
   evolution. This paper analyzes approaches to the management of genetic
   variability using examples from research and development operations in
   the Cote d'lvoire and Niger. Orientations are proposed concerning the
   conservation and management of genetic resources in relation to the
   organization of aquaculture development in Africa.}},

Title = {{Local dispersion of the Eucalyptus leaf beetle Chrysophtharta bimaculata
   (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), and implications for forest protection}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{1. Chrysophtharta bimaculata is a native chrysomelid species that can
   cause chronic defoliation of plantation and regrowth Eucalyptus forests
   in Tasmania, Australia. Knowledge of the dispersion pattern of C.
   bimaculata was needed in order to assess the efficiency of an integrated
   pest management (IPM) programme currently used for its control.
   2. Using data from yellow flight traps, local populations of C.
   bimaculata adults were monitored over a season at spatial scales
   relevant to commercial forestry: within a 50-ha operational management
   unit (a forestry `coupe') and between coupes. In addition, oviposition
   was monitored over a season at a subset of the between-coupe sites.
   3. Dispersion indices (Taylor's Power Law and Iwao's Mean Crowding
   regression method) demonstrated that C. bimaculata adults were spatially
   aggregated within and between coupes, although the number of egg-batches
   laid at the between-coupe scale was uniform. Spatial autocorrelation
   analysis showed that trap-catches at the within-coupe level were similar
   (positively autocorrelated) to a radius distance of approximately 110 m,
   and then dissimilar (negatively autocorrelated) at approximately 250 m.
   At the between-coupe scale, no repeatable spatial autocorrelation
   patterns were observed.
   4. For any individual site, rapid changes in beetle density were
   observed to be associated with loosely aggregated flights of beetles
   into and out of that site. Peak adult catches (> the weekly mean plus
   standard deviation trap-catch) for a site occurred for a period of 2.0
   +/- 0.22 weeks at a time (n = 37), with normally only one or two peaks
   per site per season. Peak oviposition events for a site occurred on
   average 1.4 +/- 0.11 times per season and lasted 1.5 +/- 0.12 weeks.
   5. Analysis of an extensive data set (n = 417) demonstrated that adult
   abundance at a site was positively correlated with egg density, but
   negatively correlated with tree damage (caused by conspecifics) and the
   presence of conspecific larvae. There was no relationship between adult
   abundance and a visual estimate of the amount of young foliage on trees.
   6. Adults of C. bimaculata are show n to occur in relatively small,
   mobile aggregations. This means that pest surveys must be both regular
   (less than 2 weeks apart) and intensive (with sampling points no more
   than 150 m apart) if beetle populations are to be monitored with
   confidence. Further refinement of the current IPM strategy must
   recognize the problems posed by this temporal and spatial patchiness,
   particularly with regard to the use of biological insecticides, such as
   Bacillus thuringiensis, for which only a very short operational window
   exists.}},

Abstract = {{1. Monitoring schemes for butterflies in the United Kingdom and the
   Netherlands are aimed at the detection of long-term trends. It is useful
   to examine the power of these schemes to detect trends in a given period
   of time.
   2. The approach was based on an A NOVA-model, and the trends were
   compared with the random population changes from one year to another.
   Several assumptions were made for simplicity's sake: autocorrelation in
   the data was ignored and only linear trends in log(10) (N + 1)
   transformed data were examined.
   3. The relevant variance components to examine were the year-to-year
   variances and year-by-site variances. These were estimated from the time
   series of the British Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, Year-to-year
   variances appeared to be higher in northern Britain than in other
   regions. In addition, variance components were related to the voltinism
   of species.
   4. Power assessment was based on the estimates of variance components
   and on the number of sampling sites. In the British scheme, for 37 out
   of 51 species studied a decrease of 50\% or less is detectable with a
   power of 80\% within a 20-year period. In the Dutch scheme such a
   decrease is detectable for 29 out of 47 species.
   5. Because the schemes lack power for a number of species, several
   strategies are discussed to enhance power. For species present at less
   than 25 sites, it is most effective to increase the number of sampling
   sites where they are present, if that is possible in practice. But for
   species that are present at more than 50 sites, a further increase
   hardly improves the power. For these species, it is more efficient to
   adjust the data for weather conditions than to increase the number of
   sites,
   6. The assumptions we made hardly affect the results for common species.
   But for rare species the results are more or less questionable, To get
   better estimates of the power, methods to assess power for monitoring
   schemes need to be developed that treat count data as discrete random
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), pheromone traps are
   typically placed in the open or above vegetation to monitor adult
   presence and abundance in areas where moths are likely to aggregate.
   After noting in another study that more moths were captured in traps
   overgrown with vegetation than in traps above it, replicated field
   experiments were conducted at 2 locations in Delaware to determine if
   placement of traps within the vegetation was more effective than traps
   placed above the canopy. At Newark, 3.83 times more males were captured
   in traps baited with Z-pheromone lure when traps were placed just below
   the canopy top in mixed weedy vegetation compared with traps 3 m away
   with the pheromone source 50 cm above the plant canopy. At Laurel in a
   monoculture of developing wheat, 2.72 times more males were captured in
   traps baited with E pheromone lure which were placed below the top of
   the canopy versus trans above the canopy Greater variation in male moth
   captures was associated with greater diversity of the weedy sample
   location relative to samples in wheat monoculture. Also, traps placed
   within vegetation resulted in less variation in mean moth captures
   versus traps placed above the canopy. This indicates that a better
   estimate of the population may be obtained by placing traps within
   vegetation. Results suggest that males are more likely to respond to
   calling females within the vegetation as opposed to above the canopy
   Placement of pheromone traps with the pheromone source below the top of
   the canopy appears to be critical for maximizing their effective capture
   of European corn borer male moths. We suggest that enhancement of
   pheromone lures within vegetation may be caused by water vapor and
   volatiles associated with plants.}},

Volume = {{213}},

Abstract = {{The South Carolina coastal plain is currently facing rapid population
   growth and suburbanization. Suburbanization brings the potential for
   surface- and ground water contamination from the use of nitrogen-based
   fertilizers, which can render water toxic to humans and fish, and lead
   to eutrophication. Additionally, nitrate is highly mobile in sediments
   and poses the potential for contamination of receiving waters,
   downstream areas, and ground water. The objectives of this study were to
   evaluate the differences in ground water quality and sediment
   denitrification rates at two sites, an undeveloped forested area (Oyster
   Creek, North Inlet, SC) and an area which has been developed for
   residential and commercial use (Dog Creek, Murrells Inlet, SC). Ground
   water monitoring wells were installed at the two sites at several
   sampling depths ranging from 0.6 m to 5 m. Ground water samples were
   collected every 4-8 weeks for 16 months, and analyzed in the field for
   pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO), and in the
   laboratory for nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate and total organic
   carbon (TOC). Additionally, sediment samples were collected from two
   locations in both creek bottoms from approximately 1.0 m depth, and
   microbial denitrification was estimated using the acetylene block
   technique by measuring the accumulation of nitrous oxide (N2O). Ground
   water at both sites was microaerophilic, ranging from 0.4 to 1 mg O-2/l.
   Ammonia and TOC concentrations were significantly higher at the forested
   site due to higher inputs of organic matter in the form of leafy
   vegetation, whereas nitrate concentrations were significantly higher at
   the suburban site. Sediments from both sites were able to rapidly
   convert NO3 to N2O with progressive depletion of NO3 in extracted
   sediments. Both the rate of N2O production and the conversion
   efficiencies were found to increase with increasing nitrate
   concentrations from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/g. The smallest nitrate concentration
   had the lowest N2O production and NO3 conversion efficiency. However,
   for the intermediate treatment (0.25 mg/g) conversion efficiencies were
   variable. In addition to potential increased NO3 inputs, increased
   drainage for development present at suburban sites may cause aeration of
   near channel soils and favor the oxidized, more mobile form of nitrogen.
   Because the suburban site has steeper hydraulic gradients, and nitrate
   is highly mobile, there is potential for both nitrate transport to the
   estuary and accumulation in the shallow water-table aquifer at the
   suburban site. However, it appears that the microbial communities from
   both sites were well adapted to denitrifying inputs of nitrate in the
   concentration ranges tested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{By late 1985, the population of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides
   borealis) at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, had declined to a
   low of four individuals. Because of extensive timber harvesting prior to
   the 1950s, the older live pine trees that Red-cockaded Woodpeckers
   require for cavity construction were limited. We monitored the response
   of the population to intensive habitat enhancement that included
   construction of artificial cavities, control of cavity competitors, and
   removal of the hardwood mid-story to improve nesting habitat quality.
   Translocations of Red-cockaded `Woodpeckers from on-site and donor
   populations were undertaken to enhance the number of breeding pairs, the
   overall population size, and to minimize potential adverse genetic
   consequences of a small population size. From 1986-1995, we carried out
   54 translocations, installed 305 artificial cavities, and removed 2304
   southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) (a cavity competitor).
   Concomitant intensive population monitoring revealed that the number of
   breeding pairs of woodpeckers increased from 1 to 19 and the overall
   population size grew from 4 to 99 individuals, reflecting the highly
   focused habitat restoration effort. Intensive management has been
   successful in rehabilitating this critically small population of
   endangered birds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the work of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme
   (OCP) in West Africa, a programme which over a 22 year history has
   reduced the public health problems of blinding onchocerciasis in eleven
   countries of West-Africa through vector control and, more recently,
   ivermectin distribution. The paper emphasizes the different approaches
   to control the programme has developed in the different parts of the
   programme area which have been determined by the epidemiology of the
   disease (savanna/forest form), the migratory characteristics of the
   vectors, intensity of the disease before commencement of treatment, the
   combined impact of vector control and ivermectin and the likelihood of
   infiltration of infective blackflies from outside the programme area.
   The programme has constantly monitored the impact of operations on the
   trends in prevalence, incidence, annual transmission potential, ocular
   morbidity and species of fly populations, and as a result, has
   identified areas where special interventions are required until the
   programme comes to an end in 2002. The paper illustrates the changes in
   intensity of infection as measured by community microfilarial load and
   annual transmission potential over the duration of the programme control
   activities. The paper also defines and justifies the control strategies
   in different areas and identifies areas for special interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological changes in the Senegal River Basin (SRB) resulting from the
   construction of a barrage at Diama, Senegal on the Senegal River to
   prevent the intrusion of sea water into the river, and a dam at
   Manantali, Mall on the Bafing River to control the flow of water and to
   generate electricity, have been responsible for changes in the
   epidemiology of human schistosomiasis. The introduction of Schistosoma
   mansoni into the Lower and Middle Valleys of the SRB and subsequent
   spread of the parasite in the human population is recorded with regard
   to prevalence and intensity. New foci of S. haematobium are described.
   The reduction in salinity and change from an acidic to an alkaline
   environment in the water are beneficial to both the fecundity and growth
   of freshwater snails and transmission of the parasite. The creation of
   new irrigation canals and expansion of the rice fields have provided new
   habitats for intermediate hosts to colonize. The evidence for
   praziquantel resistance/tolerance by populations of S. mansoni and the
   possibilities of the development, production and testing of a vaccine
   against human schistosomiasis are discussed. Future studies will monitor
   the spread of human urinary and mesenteric schistosomiasis in the SRB,
   will evaluate further the presence of praziquantel resistance/tolerance
   in S. mansoni, will examine the heavily infected human population for
   pathological symptoms and determine the most appropriate methods to
   control this severe outbreak of human schistosomiasis.}},

Abstract = {{In Britain, much emphasis has been placed on conserving butterfly
   species in specialized habitats, since this is where most of it's
   threatened butterflies exist, whilst the wider countryside has been
   largely overlooked. However, there is increasing awareness that small
   improvements to the dominant landscape could potentially reap huge
   benefits to the populations of many of Britain's butterfly species.
   Recent studies have also stressed the importance of the landscape scale
   in the conservation of butterflies in small fragmented habitats. In this
   paper, we examine data from a variety of sources and conclude that the
   importance of shelter in open landscapes may be underestimated since
   recording is often restricted to the optimum conditions suggested by the
   Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. In less favourable conditions, butterflies
   may place greater reliance on those components of the landscape offering
   shelter. In light of the current policy of agricultural
   de-intensification we discuss how modifications to our current
   landscapes could benefit a wide range of species.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonality of Delesseria sanguinea, Membranoptera alata, and
   Phycodrys rubens (Rhodophyta) was studied at Helgoland (North Sea,
   Germany) and Roscoff (Brittany, France). Plants were collected at
   bimonthly intervals, and growth and reproduction were monitored. Growth
   of blades was observed mainly in spring, although small blades were
   found on plants of M. alata and P. rubens all year round. In summer,
   plants started to degenerate and in autumn they became fertile. The
   reproductive season of D. sanguinea lasted from October to
   February/April at both locations, whereas reproductive plants of M.
   alata and P. rubens were found until April at Helgoland and until June
   and August, respectively, in Roscoff. Lower winter temperatures at
   Helgoland than at Roscoff may have caused these differences in the
   duration of the reproductive season. Using published data, the seasonal
   patterns at Helgoland and Roscoff were compared to those found at other
   locations (e.g. Barents Sea; Maine, USA; Isle of Man, UK) and local
   temperature/daylength conditions. Blade growth was synchronized across
   all populations and occurred in spring when temperatures were usually
   still suboptimal for growth. Maximum reproduction was generally found in
   the colder half of the year but started earlier in autumn in the Barents
   Sea. Adaptive strategies in the seasonal control of growth and
   reproduction are discussed. Adequate timing of the history events (e.g.
   appearance of juveniles in spring) appears more important than maximal
   growth and reproduction of adults during the season with the most
   favorable temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Dreissena polymorpha has been invading fresh waterbodies of eastern and
   western Europe since the beginning of the 19th century and is still
   invading. A long history of monitoring and experimental studies
   conducted in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) has provided us with an
   understanding of the effects of zebra mussels on waterbodies they
   invade. However, this work has not been generally available. We review
   work conducted in the FSU and eastern Europe over the past 60 y on the
   community effects of this invading species. In freshwater areas, where
   Dreissena are the only bivalves that attach to hard substrates and have
   a planktonic larval stage, they can become enormously abundant and,
   within a short period of time, can obtain a biomass 10 times greater
   than that of all other native benthic invertebrates. When zebra mussels
   invade, benthic invertebrate communities change dramatically in terms of
   total biomass, species composition, and relative abundance of functional
   groups. Native filter feeders are outcompeted by D. polymorpha and
   decrease in abundance, while animals feeding on the sediments increase
   in abundance. Although D. polymorpha can cause a dramatic decline in the
   abundance of unionids, after initial peaks in zebra mussel abundance, D.
   polymorpha coexist with unionids. Dreissena are very effective filter
   feeders and shift materials from the pelagic to the benthos through
   their filter feeding and deposition of pseudofeces. When zebra mussels
   invade phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance decreases, the biomass of
   benthophage fish increases. and a greater percentage of the primary
   productivity is consumed by higher trophic levels than in systems
   without zebra mussels.}},

Abstract = {{A three-year field study was conducted during 1993 to 1995 to determine
   the importance of mosquitoes in the diet of anurans. The study was aimed
   to assess the impact of biological mosquito control on the populations
   of amphibia in the Rhine Valley, Germany. Sampling took place in two
   areas with stands of different deciduous trees at the western bank of
   the Rhine (north of Karlsruhe, Germany) from early May to late October.
   The frequency and species composition of the terrestrial stages of
   Amphibia was monitored by hand catches and by live pitfall trapping. A
   total of 2,419 Amphibia were caught in the three years. Of these, 95.8\%
   were anurans, consisting of 77\% Ranidae, with 25.5\% Rana arvalis, and
   4.2\% were Urodela, Salamandridae. All anura caught were subjected to
   `'stomach flushing'' to yield their stomach contents before they were
   released again. The stomachs of 2,163 anuran specimens contained an
   average of 7.7 prey items, of which only 0.16\% were Culicidae. In R.
   arvalis the total diet consisted of 33\% Collembola, spiders and
   beetles; 0.1\% of the specimens in the diet were Culicidae. The most
   common culicid species in the study area, Aedes vexans, was also most
   often found in the anuran stomachs. However, no correlation existed
   between the number of mosquitoes and their number as prey of Anura. It
   is concluded that anurans will not be negatively affected by biological
   mosquito control in the Rhine Valley. Furthermore, the impact of anurans
   on Culicidae seems to be negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Studies to identify gaps in the protection of habitat for species of
   concern have been inconclusive and hampered by single-scale or poor
   multi-scale sampling methods, large minimum mapping units (MMU's of 2 ha
   to 100 ha), limited and subjectively selected field observations, and
   poor mathematical and ecological models. We overcome these obstacles
   with improved multi-scale sampling techniques, smaller MMU's (< 0.02
   ha), an unbiased sampling design based on double sampling, improved
   mathematical models including species-area curves corrected for habitat
   heterogeneity and geographic information system-based ecological models.
   We apply this landscape analysis approach to address resource issues in
   Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Specifically, we quantify the
   effects of elk grazing on plant diversity, identify areas of high or
   unique plant diversity needing increased protection, and evaluate the
   patterns of non-native plant species on the landscape.
   Double sampling techniques use satellite imagery, aerial photography,
   and field data to stratify homogeneous and heterogeneous units and
   `'keystone ecosystems'' (ecosystems that contain or support a high
   number of species or have distinctive species compositions). We show how
   a multi-scale vegetation sampling design, species-area curves, analyses
   of within-and between-vegetation type species overlap, and geographic
   information system (GIS) models can be used to quantify landscape-scale
   patterns of vascular plant diversity in the Park.
   The new multi-scale vegetation plot techniques quickly differentiated
   plant species differences in paired study sites, Three plots in the
   Ouzel Burn area (burned in 1978) contained 75 plant species, while only
   17 plant species were found in paired plots outside the burn. Riparian
   areas contained 109 plant species, compared to just 55 species in paired
   plots in adjacent forests. However, plant species richness patterns
   inside and outside elk exclosures were more complex, One elk exclosure
   contained more species than its adjacent open range (52 species inside
   and 48 species outside). Two elk exclosures contained fewer species
   inside than outside (105 and 41 species inside and 112 and 74 species
   outside, respectively). However, there was only 26\% to 48\% overlap
   (using Jaccard's Coefficient) of plant species composition inside and
   outside the exclosures. One elk exclosure had 13\% cover of
   non-indigenous species inside the exclosure compared to 4\% outside, but
   non-indigenous species cover varied by location.
   We compared plant diversity patterns from vegetation maps made with 100
   ha, 50 ha, 2 ha, and 0.02 ha MMU's in the 754 ha Beaver Meadows study
   area using four 0.025 ha and twenty-one 0.1 ha multi-scale vegetation
   plots. Preliminary data suggested that the 2 ha MMU provided an accurate
   estimate of the number of plant species (-14\%) for a study area, but
   the number of habitats (polygons) was reduced by 67\%, and aspen, a
   unique and important habitat type, was missed entirely, We describe a
   hypothesis-driven approach to the design and implementation of
   geospatial databases for local resource monitoring and ecosystem
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Meiobenthos at the mouth of the Grevelingen and Oosterschelde Estuaries
   in the Southern Eight of the North Sea was monitored using meiobenthic
   abundance and nematode community structure. Hierarchical sampling
   included 54 subsamples nested within 18 cores within six stations within
   two transects. The spatial patterns of the meiofaunal populations and
   communities are presented in cm-scale (among subsamples), m-scale (among
   cores), km-scale (among stations) and IO km-scale (between transects).
   The variance components analysis of meiofaunal abundances showed that
   km-scale and 10 km-scale represented 63-90\% of total variance while
   m-scale and cm-scale provided only 10-37\%. Different communities were
   found among stations rather than among cores or subsamples by detrended
   correspondence analysis ordination and clustering analysis. The main
   assemblage of meiofauna occurred at the km-scale. Nematode diversity was
   more powerful than meiofaunal abundance in detecting spatial variation
   at all scales. However, at least two replicates are required for
   monitoring when sampling using a 10 cm(2) subsampling core. Copyright

   occurs on the east coast of New Zealand in the Auckland region. Eighteen
   sites were searched within the Tamaki Estuary: six had extensive mats of
   mussels and three contained small, isolated clumps. Core samples were
   taken monthly during 1994/95 from two of the mat-forming populations.
   Densities reached 16 000 m(-2) at Bucklands Beach and 5000 m(-2) at Farm
   Cove. Both populations were dominated by a single cohort of mussels.
   Mussels grew to about 20 mm in 12 months, after which growth virtually
   ceased. Recruitment was sporadic into existing mats, but occurred
   adjacent to the monitored mat at Bucklands Beach in April 1995. The area
   occupied by the initial mussel bed at this site decreased by 60\% over 1
   year. Further core sampling revealed significantly fewer macrofaunal
   invertebrates under mussel mats compared to control samples taken from
   areas of beach without mussels. Infaunal bivalves were most adversely
   affected by M. senhousia, showing an 8-fold decrease in abundance within
   mats compared to cores in the control area. Our results reveal that M.
   senhousia in the Auckland area has similar life history features to
   those reported from populations outside New Zealand. We suggest that any
   adverse environmental effects caused by M. senhousia are likely to be
   local and short-lived.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in the recruitment of benthic marine invertebrates is often
   attributed to the interaction of the supply of new individuals to a
   habitat and the availability of space for colonisation when they arrive.
   Also important in determining variation in recruitment is the response
   of the larvae to the characteristics of the habitat. Larvae of many
   benthic marine invertebrates have shown great specificity of
   requirements in setting their limits of distribution at the time of
   selection of a habitat. The tubeworm Galeolaria caespitosa shows great
   variation in recruitment from place to place on rocky intertidal
   seashores and is a gregarious animal with larvae showing directed
   responses to conspecific adults on the substratum. I hypothesised that,
   if variation in recruitment of G. caespitosa were independent of
   conditions on the substratum, the magnitude of recruitment in patches of
   the same shape but different sizes cleared within continuous mats of
   conspecific adults would be directly related to the area available for
   colonisation in the patch. Alternatively, if variation in recruitment
   were due to the response of larvae to conspecific adults on the
   substratum, the magnitude of recruitment would be a function of the
   perimeter of the patch, which, given patches of the same shape, is a
   measure of the influence of conspecific adults in that patch. To
   distinguish between these alternatives, small (area = 25 cm(2) perimeter
   = 20 cm) and large (area = 225 cm(2); perimeter 60 cm) square patches
   were cleared within continuous mats of conspecific adults at four sites
   and recruitment of G. caespitosa was monitored over two seasons of
   recruitment. The density of recruits per unit area was, on average,
   almost three times greater in small than in large patches, indicating
   that recruitment of G. caespitosa is not directly related to the area of
   the patch. In contrast, the density of recruits per unit perimeter was
   not significantly different between small and large patches, indicating
   that recruitment of G. caespitosa is related to the proximity of
   conspecific adults in the patch. Therefore, at a given site, the
   perimeter of patches within mats of G. caespitosa is a better predictor
   of the relative magnitude of recruitment among patches than that
   provided by their areas. These results are contrary to many models of
   invertebrate recruitment that assume close linkage between available
   space on the substratum and settlement. Moreover, they highlight the
   importance of behavioural responses of animals at the time of selection
   of habitat in accounting for variation in recruitment. For populations
   of organisms that display gregarious behaviour at settlement, or
   conspecific attraction, this direct relationship between the perimeter
   of patches and recruitment could be used asa tool in restoring
   populations to disturbed habitats. The added benefit of such
   facilitative interactions in restoring populations is that they provide
   increasing returns to the population for a given supply of potential
   colonists to a habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Solarization trials were carried out over 3 years and in two countries
   to control crown gall disease on fruit trees and eliminate
   Agrobacterium. In 1992, agrobacteria in naturally infested soils of two
   Italian nurseries were monitored before and after solarization.
   Agrobacteria populations decreased by 99\% and 92\% after the treatment;
   however, crown gall incidence did not decrease. In 1993 and 1994
   solarization was tested in Oregon in fields artificially infested with
   two marked strains of A. tumefaciens. In sandy loam soil, the target
   bacteria were eliminated in 4 weeks, while in silty clay soil the
   populations were markedly reduced after 2 months of treatment. Crown
   gall incidence on cherry rootstocks transplanted to the field at the end
   of 1993 was 3.7\% in the sandy loam soil control plots, while no tumours
   were observed on plants from solarized plots. The use of solarization in
   combination with reduced doses of metham-sodium was also evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The number of potential annual generations of the rusty grain beetle,
   Cryptolestes ferrugineus, was simulated in wheat stored in granaries for
   all crop districts in the prairie provinces of Canada each year from
   1952 to 1990 using a population dynamic model driven by ecological
   variables. Granary size was assumed to be 6 m in diameter. Historical
   data for temperatures at harvest and times when storage began were used
   in the simulation model. A second model, which predicted the rate of
   temperature change at the centre of a 6-m-diameter bulk of wheat,
   determined environmental parameters for the population dynamic model.
   (Grain moisture content was assumed constant at 14.5\% wet mass basis.)
   The combined model shows that the initial storage temperature is the
   most important factor responsible for predicting the number of
   generations and levels of infestation of C. ferrugineus. This finding
   was largely validated by historical grain storage and infestation data.
   For various years initial grain temperature ranged from 17.7 to 37.4
   degrees C and harvest dates were between 1 August and 20 October. The
   number of generations annually in simulations based on field conditions
   ranged from 0.35 to 6.77 with a mean of 3.29. Three or more generations
   result in a severe infestation and every year at least three simulated
   generations were completed in some crop districts. In one year, at least
   three generations were completed in every crop district. Harvest
   temperature and date permit prediction of crop districts that will
   potentially have the largest populations of C. ferrugineus so that early
   monitoring of wheat for infestations can be targeted to areas most at
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Three populations of Capitella sp. submitted to three different
   environmental conditions were monitored during one year in Alfacs Bay
   (Ebro Delta, NW Mediterranean) to estimate their respective
   contributions to the secondary production. Yearly secondary production
   of Capitella sp. at the three sites under study were 0.83
   gDW.m(-2).y(-1) for the disturbed sand site, 3.74 gDW.m(-2).y(-1) for
   the typical silt site, and 36.9 BDW.m(-2).y(-1) for the disturbed silt
   site. The corresponding P/B ratios were of 4.09 y(-1), 3.66 y(-1) and
   5.71 y(-1), respectively. Ar the two silty sites, Capitella sp.
   presents: (1) a marked seasonal variability, and (2) high production
   rates and P/B ratios, which are two characteristics of opportunists. At
   the disturbed sand site its seasonal pattern is much more stable; and
   its production much lower (although P/B ratios are still high). The
   `'within site'' seasonal differences found between the three populations
   probably did nor result from temporal changes in food quantity nor
   quality. Nevertheless, differences in protein concentrations may
   contribute to explain differences in maximal densities and biomasses
   observed among sites. Our results confirm that Capitella sp. shows a
   great plasticity relative to environment.}},

Abstract = {{Bioluminescence (Lux) genes from Vibrio harveyi were introduced into an
   artificial transposon vector pJFF350 as a constitutively expressing
   lux-genes set. The resultant recombinant plasmid pSOL2 was then
   transposed into the chromosome of fluorescent pseudomonad strains, in
   which the lux genes were stably integrated. Root colonization by the
   lux-marked strains was visually monitored by autophotography, and it was
   found that the bioluminescence intensities were highly correlated with
   the populations of the strains colonizing roots. A strain of Pseudomonas
   putida thus lux-marked was inoculated to spinach seedlings in nursery
   pots, and the root colonization was assayed. In sterile soil, the strain
   extensively colonized the entire part of the developing roots and the
   population densities at any sites were high. In non-sterile soil, only
   the inoculated site of the roots was weakly colonized. These results
   suggest that the presence of the indigenous microflora is an
   environmental constraint on root colonization of the introduced
   bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{The chorusing phenology of the crawfish frog, Rana areolata, was
   monitored at a site in east-central Kansas from 1989 to 1993. Calling
   was initiated at temporary pools each spring following rainfall events
   with temperatures of ca. greater than or equal to 13.0 degrees C. Each
   year, peak chorusing spanned only 3 to 4 nights while some calling
   occurred periodically during a 22 to 55-d period in March to early May.
   Aural surveys of calling males conducted during peak chorusing periods
   in a 9-county area revealed that R areolata remains locally common in
   areas of suitable habitat. The largest populations, as judged by calling
   activity occurred in areas with large tracts of native tallgrass
   prairie, gentle terrain, and deep, clay soils. Few calling males were
   heard in areas with shallow soils or intensive agricultural development.}},

Abstract = {{Total and inorganic Hg in 55 samples of hair from riverines, mainly
   descended from Munduruku and Apiaka Indians, living along the rivers
   Teles Pires and Juruena have been determined. The sampled population
   represents 18\% of the inhabitants of the region and they eat fish 6 or
   7 days a week. Cold-vapor AAS and alkaline digestion with CdCl2/SnCl2 as
   reducing agent were employed to estimate total Hg in hair samples. A LDC
   Analytical, Mod. 1255, Mercury monitor was used for Hg determination.
   The mean value of total Hg was 34.2 mu g g(-1), with an average of
   87.2\% of organic Hg. Ninety-three per cent of the sampled population
   present levels of Hg above 10 mu g g(-1), and 18\% over 50 mu g g(-1). A
   relationship between the mean value of Hg and age of the sampled
   population is presented. All women at child-bearing age present
   concentrations of Hg above 10 mu g g(-1). Fifty-four per cent of them
   had levels over 30 mu g, with a mean of 41.2 mu g g(-1). For the
   children under ten years of age, 14\% show Hg concentration above 50 mu
   g g(-1). Comparison of these results with those obtained in 10 other
   Amazon surveys (n=1672) is shown. The results of the concentration of
   mercury in fish, mainly piscivorous (n=967) from Amazonian and Wetland
   (pantanal matogrossense) are also presented, with a mean of 726 ng
   mg(-1). There appears to be a relationship between level of Hg in human
   and their food ingestion habits.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the nature and extent of the problem caused by the
   presence of mercury in the environment of the James Bay territory a
   Mercury Agreement was signed in 1986 jointly by the Crees, the
   Government of Quebec and Hydro-Quebec. The objectives were to minimize
   potential hazards to human health arising from the presence of mercury
   in the environment, to alleviate negative impacts on the Crees, their
   way of life and their harvesting activities and to provide for remedial
   measures. Monitoring of mercury concentrations in fish show that, 15
   years after impounding of La Grande-2 reservoir, the concentrations
   remain higher in reservoirs than in natural lakes but they are now
   deceasing in both predatory (Northern pike) and non-predatory
   (Whitefish) fishes. Monitoring of the mercury exposure among the Crees
   showed that concentrations in hair have decreased and are now
   stabilized, for most of the population, to concentrations that do not
   present a health risk. This decrease may be attributed to a reduction in
   fish consumption and/or a possible switch of the diet towards
   non-piscivorous fish, less contaminated by mercury.}},

Abstract = {{Supplemental feeding of wintering white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) has increased in recent years, yet little data address its
   implications. During January-March 1993 and 1994, consumption of
   supplemental feed, provided ad libitum, was monitored daily at 2
   recently established supplemental feeding (RSF) sites in northcentral
   Minnesota. We also monitored browse availability and use monthly at the
   2 RSF sites and at 2 control (no supplemental feeding) sites by a
   sequential clipping method. Cumulative feed consumption and deer-visits
   were consistent between sites within years, but not between years;
   greater feed consumption and deer-visits occurred during the more severe
   Winter 1994. Browse pressure differed (P < 0.0001) by month during
   Winter 1993, and by month, twig density (sparse, moderate, dense), and
   site during 1994. A site x distance interaction (P < 0.0001) in 1993 was
   not significant in 1994 when browse pressure was higher. During 1994,
   mean browse pressure at control and RSF sites was different (P <
   0.0001). A key finding in our study was that supplemental feeding
   effects differed annually. Furthermore, in both years, browse pressure
   means of both RSF sites differed, in the same manner, from mean browse
   pressure at the 2 control sites. The observed consistency of response
   among replicates, within treatments and years, suggests that
   supplemental feeding effects may apply generally to other local deer
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed 13 years of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)
   population data for Pennsylvania and conducted a mail survey of
   Pennsylvania hunters to compare trends in deer populations to the
   opinions of hunters on deer management. We used deer harvests, estimates
   of deer population parameters, and forest inventories, for 1982-1994, to
   monitor deer densities relative to overwinter carrying capacities
   (deer-density goals). The overwinter deer density that Pennsylvania
   forests could support without adversely affecting tree regeneration
   declined, statewide, from 23 to 21 deer/259 ha (1 mi.(2)) of forest
   between 1978 and 1989. In contrast, deer densities statewide peaked at
   34 deer/259 ha of forest in 1987 and declined to 29 deer/259 ha of
   forest by 1994 (41\% above goal). The decline in deer densities was the
   result of harvest regulation changes designed to increase the antlerless
   harvest. However, a 1995 hunter survey revealed 66\% of hunters believed
   deer populations were too low in the area where they did most of their
   hunting. The majority (44\%) of hunters agreed that antlerless permits
   should be reduced, and 19\% believed they should be eliminated. The
   majority of hunters agreed that controlling deer populations was
   necessary (87\%), that deer populations should be kept in balance with
   natural food supplies (89\%), and that deer affected plant and animal
   communities (56\%). The majority disagreed that damage to Pennsylvania
   forests by deer was a problem (57\%) or that deer caused serious
   conflicts with other land uses (44\%). Support from sportsmen for
   programs to reduce deer populations and protect forest ecosystems will
   require that hunters understand the adverse ecological effects of too
   many deer on forest communities. In the meantime, support for
   Pennsylvania Game Commission management recommendations will be needed
   from other special-interest groups, including farmers, foresters,
   conservationists, the timber industry, and the scientific and
   conservation communities.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that removal of a small, localized group of
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) would create an area of
   persistent, low density in the population. We documented the summer home
   ranges of 8 social groups of females at Huntington Wildlife Forest, in
   Newcomb, New York. We removed 14 members of 1 social group (the target
   group) in 1994 and monitored movements of deer in adjacent social groups
   with radiotelemetry from 1994 to 1996 to determine the response to
   removal. Removal of the target-group deer created a low-density area of
   about 1.4 km(2). However, some deer continued to occur in the removal
   area. These were males or members of the target group that we were
   unable to remove. After removal, no deer in the adjacent area moved its
   home range significantly closer to the removal area, despite the
   reduction in population density. Our findings suggest that localized
   management is possible in parks and suburban areas where deer have
   undesired effects on vegetation and other components of the ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Immunocontraception has been proposed as a technique for managing
   wildlife populations in urban and suburban settings where traditional,
   lethal control methods may not be publicly acceptable.
   Immunocontraception uses an animal's own immune response to disrupt
   reproductive function. Proteins of eggs, sperm, fertilized eggs, and
   reproductive hormones have variously been proposed for use in developing
   a vaccine for fertility control. The most widely tested
   immunocontraceptive vaccine for wild species is based on developing
   antibodies to the zona pellucida (ZP), which surrounds the mammalian egg
   cell. This vaccine has successfully caused infertility in some
   individual animals, but requires multiple treatments. Enhancement of
   immune response and efficiency of vaccine delivery will be necessary
   before this type of management strategy can be applied to wildlife
   control at the population level. Contraceptive treatment may alter the
   health and behavior of wildlife populations and therefore must be
   monitored closely.}},

Abstract = {{Deer management often is hindered by lack of public acceptance and
   confidence in census methods. Because `'seeing is believing,'' a method
   relying on photographic documentation could provide a powerful tool for
   deer managers. The purpose of our study was to determine if
   infrared-triggered cameras could be used for population estimation of
   free-ranging antlered white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a
   forested environment. Subsequently, we evaluated feasibility of using
   such estimates in conjunction with demographic ratios for population
   estimation. We used infrared-triggered cameras and monitors to census
   white-tailed deer on Longleaf Farms, a 4,047-ha area in Amite County,
   Mississippi. Two 14-day censuses were conducted, 1 in February 1992 and
   1 in February 1993. Passive infrared monitors that triggered automatic
   cameras were used to photograph deer; previously marked deer in the
   photographs provided recapture data. We derived population estimates
   from photographs using Lincoln-Petersen Index estimates from marked and
   unmarked animals, and from a separate technique we termed the camera
   estimate. The camera estimate was calculated by determining the total
   numbers of branch-antlered bucks, spike bucks, does, and fawns in
   photographs, then determining the number of individually identifiable
   branch-antlered bucks and, from ratios, the number of spike bucks, does,
   and fawns. Camera densities tested included 65, 130, and 259 ha per
   camera. With the highest camera density (1/65 ha), 30 of 30 collared
   deer (100\%) were recaptured in 1992 and 30 of 34 (88.2\%) were
   recaptured in 1993. Camera estimates using ratios of spikes, does, and
   fawns to branch-antlered bucks yielded population estimates of 715 and
   580 deer for 1992 and 1993, respectively. Lincoln-Petersen estimates
   yielded 727 and 573 deer for the same respective periods. However, at
   different camera densities, the sex ratios and Lincoln-Petersen Index
   population estimates differed significantly (P less than or equal to
   0.001). There was an inverse relationship between camera density and
   Lincoln-Petersen Index population estimates. Percent females increased
   as camera density increased, indicating higher recapture estimates of
   males over females at low camera densities. Although population and
   sex-ratio estimates differed among camera-station densities,
   infrared-triggered cameras are useful tools to census deer in forested
   environments. Minimally, they provide estimates of adult bucks present.
   Cost of a 14-day census amortized over a 5-year equipment life
   expectancy ranged \$0.37-1.29/ha/year depending on camera coverage.}},

Abstract = {{We exposed nesting Northern Cardinals (C. cardinalis) to models of three
   predators of cardinal eggs or nestlings (black rat snake {[}Elaphe
   obsoleta], Blue Jay {[}Cyanocitta cristata], and eastern chipmunk
   {[}Tamias striatus]). We attempted to determine relative contributions
   to nest defense by males and females during the mid-nestling stage of
   the nesting cycle. For all defense variables monitored, mean responses
   did not differ between the sexes, although females spent more time in
   attendance at the nest. Latency to response to the models was strongly
   correlated between mates, but responses by mates appeared to be
   independent at the nest. There was little evidence for stimulus-specific
   defense. Parent bird responses to the predator models and to a mounted
   Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura, a `'non-threat'') likewise did not
   differ. Active defense of nests may be of limited importance to
   reproductive success in this cardinal population.}},

Abstract = {{Traps baited with synthetic aggregation pheromone and fermenting bread

   ripening fruit pests, Carpophilus hemipterus (L.), C. mutilatus Erichson
   and C. davidsoni Dobson in stone fruit orchards in the Leeton district
   of southern New South Wales during five seasons (1991-96). Adult beetles
   were trapped from September-May, but abundance varied considerably
   between years with the amount of rainfall in December-January having a
   major influence on population size and damage potential during the
   canning peach harvest Gate February-March). Below average rainfall in
   December-January was associated with mean trap catches of <10
   beetles/trap/week in low dose pheromone traps during the harvest period
   in 1991/92 and 1993/94 and no reported damage to ripening fruit.
   Rainfall in December-January 1992/93 was more than double the average
   and mean trap catches ranged from 8-27 beetles/week during the harvest
   period with substantial damage to the peach crop. December-January
   rainfall was also above average in 1994/95 and 1995/96 and means of
   50-300 beetles/trap/week were recorded in high dose pheromone traps
   during harvest periods. Carpophilus spp. caused economic damage to peach
   crops in both seasons. These data indicate that it may be possible to
   predict the likelihood of Carpophilus beetle damage to ripening stone
   fruit in inland areas of southern Australia, by routine pheromone-based
   monitoring of beetle populations and summer temperatures and rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{A potential problem exists with the use of relative clutch mass (RCM =
   total clutch mass/female postparturient mass) as an estimate of
   reproductive output, When examining RCM among individuals or subsamples
   such as years, sites, age classes etc., one must assume that the
   mass/length relationship is equal for each individual or subsample, When
   this assumption is violated, interpretations of reproductive output
   through RCM may he systematically biased.
   This paper describes the potential bias in the interpretation of
   reproductive output through RCM and proposes three alternative
   estimators for this trait, I argue that the first of these estimators
   (ovulational residuals) is logically the `'best'' estimate of relative
   reproductive output among females or groups, short of monitoring the
   calories accrued and allocated to reproduction, Ovulational residuals
   are the residuals front the multiple regression of total clutch mass on
   both female length and female mass at ovulation, i.e., when investment
   in reproduction is determined, However, mass at ovulation is not often
   available, especially for viviparous species because of the gestation
   period, Therefore, like RCM, the two other proposed alternative
   estimators (postparturient residuals and RCM1), require postparturient
   female mass in their calculation, rendering them generally more
   practical, Correlations between the ovulational residuals and each of
   the three more practical estimators of relative reproductive output
   (RCM, postparturient residuals, and RCM1) indicate that RCM1, a linear
   adjustment of RCM by postparturient condition, most closely approximates
   the logically best estimate of output (ovalational residuals).
   Data from a four-year field study of reproduction in Nerodia sipedon at
   two locations are analyzed using both RCM and RCM1. Additionally, RCM1
   values are estimated for four prior studies with snakes, and conclusions
   resulting from both RCM and RCM1 are compared. Conclusions resulting
   from RCM1 differ from those resulting from RCM in ways that suggest that
   RCM1 more accurately represents the reproductive biology of these
   systems. Additional work is needed, especially with oviparous species,
   to determine the general validity and applicability of these methods.}},

Abstract = {{The ecology and behaviour of non-territorial owls are little known.
   During a population peak of snowshoe hares, Lepus americanus, the main
   prey of great horned owls, Bubo virginianus, in the boreal forest,
   fledglings were equipped with radiotransmitters, and 30 successful
   dispersers were monitored in 1988-1991. Of those, nine became resident
   floaters in the study area. Transient floaters were not recorded,
   although floaters shifted the centre of their home ranges more than
   territorial owls. Floater home ranges were about five times larger than
   defended territories, but the space use did not differ significantly.
   Floaters intruded regularly into territories and their locations
   overlapped broadly with those of territory owners and other floaters,
   but were concentrated on the periphery of defended territories. This is
   consistent with other evidence that territorial behaviour limits the
   breeding density of great horned owls even at extreme peaks of prey
   availability. None of the monitored floaters bred as secondary females,
   and the intrusion rates and movement patterns of floaters did not change
   during the fertile period of females, as predicted if male floaters were
   seeking extra-pair copulations. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{A field survey of Nesohedyotis arborea reveals that there ave 132 adult
   trees in the wild, making it one of the commoner endemic plants of St
   Helena. The trees exhibit leaky dioecy:females are entirely
   male-sterile, but `males' do set a small amount of seed. The floral
   differences between the two morphs are marked: the female is long-styled
   with large, smooth stigmatic papillae and vestigial anthers, while the
   male is short-styled with small, rugose stigmatic papillae and large
   anthers overarching the style. The dioecy probably evolved
   autochthonously on the island from an ancestral heterostylous condition.
   The pal tial loss of female function in males is associated with the
   production of smaller ovules: approximately a third of the volume of the
   female ovules. The sex ratio of adult trees is 3:2 in favour of males,
   due to greater allocation of resources in vegetative survival by males.
   Pollination is by small syrphid flies and is highly efficient up to
   distances of 50 m, and most of the gene flow in the population is
   contributed by pollen transport rather than seed dispersal. Although the
   population has been fragmented by human land-use patterns, rather few
   individuals are completely reproductively isolated. An assessment is
   given of the implications for conservation of the patterns of gene flow
   and spatial distribution of individuals. The mating system of
   Nesohedyotis reduces the effective population size, but this is likely
   to be more than outweighed by the effective outbreeding that it
   promotes. However, subpopulations should be monitored to assure
   co-sexuality, with, if appropriate, supplementary planting of opposite
   sex individuals. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and relative density of smooth-coated otters Lutra
   perspicillata Geoffroy were studied along a 425 km stretch of Chambal
   river within the National Chambal Sanctuary, Central India, between 1988
   and 1992. Sample sites of 1 km were surveyed every 5 km. The study
   revealed that the distribution of otters along the river is patchy and
   largely restricted to the upper reaches. During the 1988 survey, 36\% of
   sites were found with otter signs but only 24\% in 1992. Recent
   increases in disturbance along the river due to construction of road
   bridges and mining activities might have put pressure on the population.
   Most of the positive sites (66\%) were found on rocky banks, followed by
   clay banks (19\%), banks with shoreline vegetation and marsh (11\%) and
   sandy banks (3\%). During intensive monitoring of four radio-implanted
   otters, c. 78\% locations were made on rocky banks, 19\% on banks with
   shoreline vegetation and marsh, with <3\% on sandy banks and <1\% on
   clay banks, indicating greater preference for rocky banks owing to the
   greater availability of den sites. As a conservation measure, monitoring
   of the otter population should be done regularly and restrictions on
   cultivation, grazing and mining along the banks should be imposed within
   the Sanctuary limits, especially in the identified stretches. (C) 1997

   (Caretta caretta) nesting in Brazil. Data on incubation durations were
   collected from 11 nesting beaches monitored for up to six seasons. It
   was estimated that 82.5\% of the loggerhead hatchlings produced were
   female. The strongly female-biased sex ratio in Brazil is similar to
   that found previously for loggerheads using beaches in the eastern
   U.S.A. This suggests that a female-biased hatchling sex ratio may be a

Abstract = {{We studied the decay and collapse of trees with hollows in the montane
   ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, southeastern
   Australia. We monitored the condition of >1400 trees for varying periods
   of time between 1983 and 1993 on 181 sites that varied considerably in
   stand age, tree species composition, slope, aspect, disturbance history,
   and a wide range of other parameters. The data analyzed in this study
   were from: (1) 302 trees on 32 sites, each of 3 ha, measured first in
   1983 and then again in 1988 and 1993; (2) 1006 trees on 132 3-ha sites
   surveyed both in 1988 and 1993; and (3) 399 trees, measured in 1990 and
   again 1993, that occurred within 49 wildlife corridors where the
   surrounding forest recently had been clearcut. Our results revealed that
   >40\% of the 302 trees first measured during 1983 had collapsed and
   fallen to the forest floor by 1993, The annual rate of collapse of trees
   was more rapid between 1988 and 1993 (4.8\%) than between 1983 and 1988
   (3.6\%). Transition matrices constructed for the probability of tree
   collapse during each of these 5-yr sampling periods did not differ
   significantly (P < 0.05) between sampling periods or groups of sites.
   We used legit regression modeling to estimate the likelihood of collapse
   of hollow-bearing trees in relation to their physical characteristics
   and the attributes of the sites on which they occurred. The collapse of
   trees with hollows was significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by a range of
   factors, including tree form and diameter as well as the aspect of the
   site on which they occurred. These parameters were different from those
   in wildlife corridors, where tree collapse was related to factors such
   as aspect and the size of the adjacent logged area.
   Hollow-bearing trees are a critical component of the vegetation
   structure in montane ash forests, providing nest and den sites for a
   large proportion of the vertebrate fauna that occur in these areas. The
   rate of tree fall exceeds recruitment of new hollow-bearing trees within
   montane ash forests. Predictions of the future availability of
   hollow-bearing trees, assuming that the underlying processes affecting
   our data persist, showed that very few 3-ha sites are likely to support
   more than five hollow trees within 50-75 yr. These projections suggest a
   negative effect of tree loss for populations of hollow-dependent animals
   such as arboreal marsupials. Our results emphasize the need for careful
   management of montane ash forests over the next century to conserve
   populations of hollow-dependent fauna such as the endangered arboreal
   marsupial, Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri).}},

Abstract = {{The susceptibility of third instar larvae of Anticarsia gemmatalis
   (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera:
   Pyralidae) to ten distinct plaque purified, genotypic variants of a
   selected isolate of the Anticarsia gemmatalis multiple-embedded nuclear
   polyhedrosis virus (AgMNPV), was compared. Despite the fact that this
   isolate, AgMNPV-Ds20, represents a wild strain of the AgMNPV selected
   for higher virulence to D. saccharalis, an alternate host, most of the
   variants are much more virulent to the original host Anticarsia than to
   Diatraea. Bioassays have shown an over one hundred-fold variation in
   LD50 values ranging from 1700 polyhedron inclusion bodies (PIBs) to more
   than 200 000 PIBs/larva. The PIE production in infected larvae increased
   with the pathogenicity of the variant to the host, showing an average
   ten-fold reduction in Diatraea when compared to Anticarsia for the same
   variant. The virus particle yield ranged from 6x10(7) to more than 10(9)
   PIBs/g of infected larvae in Diatraea and from 8x10(8) to more than
   10(10) PIBs/g of infected Anticarsia larvae. The data show a clear
   difference of the pathogenicity of the genotypic variants of AgMNPV in
   vivo both between the original and alternate host and between the
   individual variants for the same host. These differences found in vivo
   indicate that monitoring of shifts in variant frequency of wild and
   laboratory-propagated viral isolates in these highly heterogeneous
   populations would help ensure the efficacy of biological control
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical models were developed relating corrected tree-ring
   chronologies of grand fir (Abies grandis {[}Dougl, ex D. Don] Lindl.)
   and Dougl as-iir (Pseudotsugata menziesii var, glauca {[}Beissn.]
   France) to population time series of Douglas-fir tussock moth (Orgyia
   pseudotsugata {[}McDunnough]) and western spruce budworm larvae
   (Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman) in the same stands, The study was
   conducted in northeastern Oregon and spanned 22 yr including 2 periods
   of defoliator outbreaks as well as an interval of no outbreaks. Changes
   in the radial increment of host trees, corrected for tree-ring age and
   weather, were inversely related to larval densities in the same year of
   growth and in each of the 4 preceding years, The strongest growth
   response was a delayed function of larval density with a 3 yrtime delay,
   Regression models giving the best fit to pooled data were second-degree
   polynomials in which log larval density with a 3 yr delay accounted for
   28.7\% of the variation in rate of change in corrected tree-ring
   indices, and 46.4\% of the variation in the absolute size of corrected
   indices. The results Imply that reductions in radial growth are directly
   related to density of feeding larvae and that the cumulative maximum
   effect on increment in the lower hole lags defoliation by 3 yr, The
   models are recommended either for directly forecasting mean reductions
   in radial increment from monitored densities of larvae or for inversely
   predicting past mean densities of defoliating larvae from
   dendrochronology data.}},

Abstract = {{1. The British song thrush (Turdus philomelos Brehm) population suffered
   a marked decline between 1975 and 1993, falling by 65\% at an average
   rate of 5.7\% per annum on farmland. We used ring recoveries to
   investigate whether this could have been brought about by changes in
   annual survival probabilities of fully grown birds.
   2. The annual survival probabilities of first-year song thrushes
   averaged 0.484 prior to the population decline (1962-75), but dropped to
   an average of 0.405 in the years 1975-93. A long-term non-linear
   decrease accounted for 32\% of the variance in the logit-transformed
   estimates of first-year annual survival probability. Adult annual
   survival probabilities did not show a similar decline; they increased
   then decreased over the same period, with 25\% of this variance, being
   described by a quadratic equation.
   3. The changes in first-year annual survival probabilities alone were
   sufficiently large to account for the observed changes in population
   size.
   4. First year annual survival probabilities were lower in years with
   cold (r(2) = 11\%) or dry (r(2) = 20\%) winters and together with the
   long-term decrease these effects explained 49\% of the variance in the
   logit-transformed estimates of first-year annual survival probability.
   Adult annual survival probabilities were lower in years with cold
   winters (r(2) = 34\%), and together with the long-term trend, this
   accounted for 51\% of the variance. These relationships with weather
   conditions explained part of the variation about the long-term trends
   but did not explain the trends themselves.
   5. This study demonstrates that an Integrated Population Monitoring
   Programme can not only alert conservationists to declining species but
   also elucidate the demographic processes underlying population declines
   on a national scale.}},

Abstract = {{Short- and long-term effects of temperature on ion flux and energy
   turnover were studied in hepatocytes from thermally acclimated trout and
   roach. In trout hepatocytes K+ efflux was insensitive towards acute
   exposure to low temperature but was downregulated during cold
   acclimation of the fish so as to balance the uncompensated decreased
   K+(Rb+) uptake of the cells. In contrast, both K+(Rb+) uptake and K+
   efflux of roach hepatocytes were temperature sensitive in the short
   term. These acute effects, however, were offset during cold acclimation
   by a near perfect compensation of both fluxes leading to
   re-establishment of ion flux homeostasis at the original level. Our
   findings, based on a new method permitting the simultaneous monitoring
   of K+ efflux and uptake in the same cell population, provide
   experimental verification of two of the three possible strategies,
   recently discussed by Cossins et al. (1995), by which the ionic steady
   state of fish cells may adjust to acute and chronic temperature change.
   By comparing hepatocytes from two groups of trout, one kept on a
   maintenance diet (ration I)! the other fed ad libitum (ration II), we
   discovered striking effects of nutritional state on the absolute levels
   as well as on the temperature relationships of K+ uptake and protein
   synthetic activity. Both of these functions in the hepatocytes increased
   in the ration II fed as compared to the ration I fed trouts, but the
   increase of protein synthetic activity was greater and more uniform at
   the three experimental temperatures than that of KC uptake. Moreover,
   protein synthetic activity proved to be considerably more temperature
   sensitive than K+ uptake and, in contrast to the latter, showed a
   compensatory response after cold acclimation.}},

Abstract = {{The intent of this study was to determine the location and functional
   influence of the branchial O-2-sensitive receptors of the crayfish on
   cardiac and respiratory parameters. Crayfish (46.6 +/- 1.7 g {[}+/-SD])
   were divided into 3 groups (A) control (gills intact), (B) posterior
   gills removed, and (C) anterior gills removed. Animals were exposed to
   hypoxic water (1 h; 15 mm Hg O-2) followed by left branchial injection
   (10 mi over 10 min) of hyperoxic water (400 mm Hg O-2). The time course
   to changes in cardiorespiratory parameters (heart-rate, cardiac output,
   stroke volume, arterial hows, ventilation rate, and branchial pressure)
   were monitored. Intact animals showed a rapid cardiovascular response to
   injection of hyperoxic water (2.5 s) with group C animals showing a
   similar response time. Group B animals exhibited a significantly longer
   response time (13.0 s). Ventilatory response time was similar for all 3
   groups (75 s), the duration of the ventilatory response was 51.0 s in
   control and group C animals. Animals lacking posterior gills showed a
   significantly shorter response time (42.0 s). Time-course evidence may
   indicate the existence of 2 populations of O-2 receptors, one
   responsible for modulation of cardiovascular functions on the posterior
   gills or in their cardiobranchial veins, the other responsible for
   ventilatory modulation located more centrally.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and two of its
   natural enemies, the ladybird Coccinella septempunctata and the fungus
   Erynia neoaphidis, were examined in the laboratory, Adult C.
   septempunctata starved for 48 or 24 hr or nonstarved were presented with
   aphid prey items at different stages of infection with E. neoaphidis and
   their feeding behaviors monitored. This demonstrated that, under
   laboratory conditions, C. septempunctata adults, particularly when
   starved for 48 hr, perceived A. pisum infected with E. neoaphidis as
   acceptable food sources. This is a potentially antagonistic interaction
   as inoculum necessary for further transmission and the development of
   epizootics would be removed from aphid populations. However, less time
   was spent feeding, except by 48-hr-starved individuals, on infected than
   on uninfected aphids and the number of `'feeding'' versus `'ignore''
   mouthpart encounters was greater for uninfected than infected aphids,
   thus limiting the severity of this antagonism, In addition, under
   laboratory conditions, C. septempunctata adults were able to passively
   vector infective conidia of E. neoaphidis to susceptible aphids and
   initiate infection in 10-11\% of the population. Ladybird foraging on E.
   neoaphidisinfected aphids and their ability to vector infective conidia
   to susceptible aphid populations is discussed in relation to the
   epizootiology of the fungus and its implications for the manipulation of

Abstract = {{Four subpopulations of Phyllotis darwini were monitored through monthly
   censuses conducted over 48 months on opposite slopes of two creeks
   separated by 2 km at a semiarid locality in Chile. Nine response
   variables were measured to characterize the spatial and temporal
   variability of the subpopulations: number of individuals per grid; mean
   body mass; coefficient of variation in body mass; coefficient of
   variation in body mass of males; coefficient of variation in body mass
   of females; number of males; number of females; number of juveniles;
   number of adults. These variables were analyzed with regard to two main
   factors (creek and slope). The demographic characteristics were more
   variable at a lower spatial scale (slope exposure) than at a larger
   spatial scale (creek). Zn situ reproduction and recruitment on each
   slope, as well as the low level of migration between slopes, indicate
   that this system is not driven by source-sink dynamics. The spatial and
   temporal dynamics of these subpopulations can be characterized as a
   partially coupled metapopulation system whose component subpopulations
   are weakly interconnected by dispersal between opposite slopes and
   totally unconnected between creeks.}},

Abstract = {{Food limitation and habitat preference of northern flying squirrels
   (Glaucomys sabrinus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were
   examined in British Columbia, Canada. Using mark-recapture techniques to
   estimate population demographics, we tested the hypotheses that
   populations of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus were limited by
   availability of food and that old-growth stands provided higher-quality
   habitat than second-growth stands. Populations were monitored on six
   study areas; two second-growth lodgepole Fine (Pinus contorta) stands
   (controls), two second-growth pine stands with food supplementation
   (treatments), and two old-growth lodgepole Dine stands. Sunflower seeds
   were applied (20 kg ha(-1) month(-1)) to treatment stands by helicopter
   in a uniform distribution for 3 summers, and mark-recapture of G.
   sabrinus and T. hudsonicus was initiated in the second summer of food
   supplementation. There were significantly more G. sabrinus and T.
   hudsonicus in treatment stands than in control stands. The mean density
   of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus in treatment stands was ca. 1.8 times
   greater than that in control stands, Estimates of population sizes for
   G. sabrinus in control stands were significantly lower than these in
   old-growth stands, Estimates of population sizes for T. hudsonicus in
   control and old-growth stands were not significantly different, Adult
   male G. sabrinus in control and treatment stands were significantly
   heavier than these in old-growth stands. Body mass for T. hudsonicus us
   and the proportion of adults breeding, recruitment, and survival rates
   for G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus did not vary among control, treatment,
   and old-growth stands, Consequently, populations of G. sabrinus and T.
   hudsonicus appeared to be limited by availability of food, but
   individuals did not appeal to benefit from food supplementation,
   Second-growth stands were not suboptimal habitat for G. sabrinus and T.

Abstract = {{Preliminary studies indicate that the recently described colonial
   tuco-tuco (Ctenomys sociabilis) is social. As part of efforts to
   characterize the behavioral ecology of this species, we examined
   patterns of use of burrows by members of a free-living population of C.
   sociabilis located in southern Neuquen Province, Argentina. As many as
   five adults (one male, four females) were captured within a single
   colony (spatially distinct cluster of burrow entrances). Spatial
   relationships among eight adults from three colonies were monitored
   using radiotelemetry. Each animal was active in only a single colony.
   Within each colony, the areas used by different adults overlapped
   extensively ((X) over bar greater than or equal to 68\%) and all animals
   shared a single nest site. Collectively, these data indicate that a
   colony of C. sociabilis consists of a single burrow system that may be
   inhabited by multiple adults. We suggest that comparative analyses of C.
   sociabilis and other colonial taxa (e.g., colonial African mole-rats;
   Bathyergidae) will significantly improve our understanding of the
   factors favoring sociality among subterranean rodents.}},

Abstract = {{Six apartments in a low-income housing project were evaluated for German
   cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), infestation and concentration of an
   allergen derived from these cockroaches (Bla g II). Kitchen and living
   room samples were collected monthly for 1 yr. In addition, airborne
   sampling was carried out in 5 kitchens. The kitchen had the highest
   allergen concentration in 65\% of visits and the highest number of
   cockroaches trapped in 69\% of visits. In the kitchen, the highest
   cockroach levels were seen in June, whereas the values for Bla g II
   peaked in August. In keeping with this, the closest correlation was
   between Bla g II (mu g/g dust) and the number of cockroaches found 2 mo
   earlier. Airborne samples were assayed for 2 separate allergens, Bla g
   II and Bla g I. No allergen was detectable in the absence of
   disturbance. By contrast, during disturbance with a vacuum cleaner both
   Bla g II and Bla g I were detectable in the air of each apartment.
   Results suggest that immunochemical assay of a major allergen in dust
   samples from the kitchen floor may be used to monitor exposure to German
   cockroaches, also that cockroach levels may be used as an indicator or
   predictor of allergen in dust.}},

Abstract = {{Hound's-tongue (Cynoglossum officinale L.) is a noxious weed on forested
   range of western North America (N.A.), which produces barbed nutlets
   (burrs) that attach to animals, There is anecdotal evidence that cattle
   are important dispersers of hound's-tongue in N.A., although European
   studies suggest animal dispersal of hound's-tongue burrs is minimal, The
   objectives of this research were to examine the role of cattle as
   hound's-tongue dispersers, and to develop a method of estimating
   hound's-tongue burr and plant density on rangeland that may be useful to
   researchers and range managers, To determine the movement of burrs onto
   cattle, the number of burrs on marked stalks, before and after grazing,
   were counted, In 1993 and 1994, about 65\% of the burrs stalk(-1) were
   picked up by grazing cattle, whereas, only 14\% of the burrs stalk(-1)
   were lost in a paddock ungrazed by cattle in 1994. Individual cows were
   monitored for burr gains and losses during monthly moves between
   paddocks by photographing their faces, and counting the burrs face(-1)
   from projected slides, Cattle also were photographed every 2 weeks while
   in-situ on paddocks, Within 2 to 4 weeks, cows acquired and then lost
   burrs as they moved within and between paddocks, These experiments
   suggest that cattle are major dispersers of hound's-tongue on
   rangelands, There was a positive, linear relationship (R-2 = 0.77;
   p<0.001, N=13) between the mean number of burrs face(-1) and the number

   the accompanying univariate analysis of variance models was also
   analysed. The analysis was based on species abundance data from
   monitoring programmes for soft-bottom marine benthos in The Netherlands.
   The first design, with random selection of stations in each year,
   revealed larger variance and smaller power than the second design, in
   which stations are sampled randomly in the first year and revisited in
   succeeding years. The third design, with fixed non-randomly selected
   stations, yielded the largest power, bur gives biased estimates of the
   year-to-year changes. These results suggest the following rule-of-thumb
   for monitoring programmes focusing on the abundance of marine benthic

   The sample consisted of 35 female and 29 male trees with a mean shortest
   distance between sexes of 232 m. Seed production and seed removal of 22
   female trees was monitored throughout the 1992 fruiting season. Female
   trees within 200 m of male trees generally produced large seeds crops (>
   100 seeds) whereas trees farther than 200 m from the nearest male had
   small seed crops (< 100 seeds) regardless of female size (DBH). Most
   seeds (63.2\%, n = 3312) produced in a sub-sample of 22 trees came from
   the five most fecund trees, which also produced 74.1\% of the seeds that
   were removed by vertebrate dispersers. Where a minority of a population

Abstract = {{The flowering phenology and Bower predation of Cullenia exarillata, a
   canopy tree at Kakachi in the southern Western Chats, India, was studied
   from 1991 to 1993 in relation to general phenological patterns at the
   community level. Flowering was monitored from 30 marked trees and flower
   predation estimated from fallen flowers in 40, 1 m(2) nets placed under
   the trees. Flowering occurs in the dry season and coincides with the
   period of fruit scarcity in the forest. Flowering is synchronous in the
   population and each tree produces a mean of c. 8730 flowers per tree
   over a period of c. 47 d. Flowers produced little nectar but the edible
   fleshy sepals compensated for this. Six species of arboreal mammals and
   seven species of birds ate the flowers. These consumed 57\% of the Bower
   crop of which 37\% were completely destroyed. Flower predators could be
   important in Bower fertilization. The overabundance of the Bower crop
   and the timing of flowering, may have evolved as a strategy to satiate
   predators and enable the flowers to be pollinated during the annual
   period of fruit scarcity in the forest. This in turn makes Cullenia
   exarillata a possible keystone species in this forest.}},

   namely take-all caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici,
   Rhizoctonia root rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG8, and Pythium root
   rot caused by several Pythium species. Populations of strain
   L324-92R(12) a rifampicin-resistant mutant of L324-92 applied as a seed
   treatment, were monitored in the rhizosphere and spermosphere of wheat
   and compared with populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens 2-79RN(10), a
   known, rhizosphere-competent, biocontrol agent. In growth chamber
   studies, the population sizes of L324-92R(12) on roots of wheat were
   approximately 1,000-fold smaller than those of 2-79RN(10) at 5 days
   after planting, but, thereafter, they increased while those of
   2-79RN(10) decreased until the two were equal in size at 45 days after
   planting. In the field with winter wheat, the population sizes of

   increased slightly, while the population of 2-79RN(10) decreased until
   the two were roughly the same at 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/plant over the
   period of 150 days (April 1994) until 285 days (harvest) after planting.
   In growth chamber studies, strain L324-92R(12) remained confined to root
   sections within 3.5 cm below the seed, whereas 2-79RN(10) was recovered
   from all root sections ranging from 0.5 to 6.5 cm below the seed. In the
   field on winter wheat, both strains were recovered from root sections
   down to 5.0 to 6.5 cm below the seed at 75 days after planting (mid
   December), but only 2-79RN(10) was recovered at this depth at 90 days
   after planting. Both strains were recovered from the seed remnants 6
   months after planting in the field. Both strains also were recovered
   from inside the roots and shoots, but population sizes of strain
   2-79RN(10) were greater than those of L324-92R(12).}},

Abstract = {{The Northwest Territories (NWT) portion of the Slave River is downstream
   of the Athabasca and Peace Rivers and the potential for contamination
   from industrial and agricultural processes from these sources and from
   long-range transport is very real. In response to this threat, the Slave
   River Environmental Quality Monitoring Program was established
   cooperatively between the government of the Northwest Territories and
   federal government agencies in 1991. A 5-year program was conducted to
   examine the quality of the water, suspended sediment, and fish in the
   territorial portion of the Slave River and to establish a baseline data
   set for comparison purposes in future monitoring programs. Additional
   facets of the study on the Slave River included an assessment of the
   benthic invertebrate population, since it was recognized that such a
   survey could be important for biomonitoring purposes. Abundance of
   organisms, taxon diversity, and presence or absence of sentinel species
   could all be used to assess environmental contamination. The final focus
   of the program was the examination of stable isotope ratios of carbon,
   sulphur, and nitrogen in the Slave River fish. Ecologically, these
   measurements can be used to determine the feeding and migration pattern
   of fish, and to define their trophic position in the food chain. From a
   toxicological Feint of view, these stable isotope ratios call help
   explain contaminant sources and transfer through the food chain. The
   benthic invertebrate survey was conducted in 1990 and 1991. The study
   concluded that the abundance of benthic invertebrates at the numerous
   sires examined in the Slave River was very low and organisms that had
   been used in other biomonitoring studies (e.g. bivalve molluscs, large
   oligochaetes) were rare or absent. Over 90\% of the invertebrates
   collected from the Slave River were chironomids or small oligochaetes
   and comparisons of benthic invertebrate communities in the Slave River
   Delta indicated that few changes in percent composition or diversity had
   occurred over a 10-year period. The benthic invertebrate survey provided
   a baseline for future population analysis. Analysis of the stable
   isotope ratio of sulphur in fish from the Slave River indicated at least
   two significant food sources. One source is probably from Great Slave
   Lake, while the other is probably upstream of Fort Smith (Athabasca and
   Peace Rivers). Also, the stable isotope of carbon indicated that the
   food source is via different pathways and may include benthic as well as
   pelagic origins. It is difficult to make any conclusions regarding the
   organic concentrations found in fish tissues and their possible
   significance to isotope analysis, since the overall contaminant body
   burdens were generally very low or below analytical detection. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The results of biological monitoring by assay of urinary
   3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and alkylphosphates (DMP, DMTP) in groups of
   9 and 2 workers exposed to chlorpyrifos-methyl during vine spraying and
   manual leaf thinning 5-11 d after spraying, respectively, are reported.
   The results are compared with those of a control group of 46 subjects
   not occupationally exposed to organophosphate insecticides.
   Significantly higher urinary excretion of metabolites (Mann-Whitney
   U-test) was found in both groups than in controls. Levels of
   3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (mean +/- SD) were 15.9 + 10.6 nmol/g
   creatinine (n = 33) for controls, 92.4 + 162.5 nmol/g creatinine (n =
   20) for manual workers, and 675.5 + 1110.8 nmol/g creatinine (n = 48)
   for workers spraying and mixing the insecticide. Levels of DMP (mean +/-
   SD) were 63.8 + 100.1 nmol/g creatinine (n = 42), 123.0 + 79.0 nmol/g
   creatinine (n = 20), and 577.2 + 1003.2 nmol/g creatinine (n = 67),
   respectively, for the same 3 groups. Levels of DMTP (mean +/- SD) were
   153.4 + 764.4 nmol/g creatinine (n = 43), 489.3 + 288.3 nmol/g
   creatinine (n = 20), and 297.6 + 215.4 nmol/g creatinine (n = 61),
   respectively, for the same 3 groups. Good correlations were found
   between urinary excretion of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and DMP (r =
   .776 for manual workers; r = .775 for workers mixing and spraying the
   insecticide) or DMTP (r = .558 and r = .746, respectively for the same 2
   groups). The peak of excretion of the three metabolites war found in
   urine samples collected the night after the spraying or leaf thinning
   operations.}},

   monitored continuously throughout behavioural oestrus consorted and
   presumably copulated with a mean of 1.9 +/- 0.8 males during a single
   period of sexual receptivity. A combination of electrophoretic and DNA
   fingerprinting analyses revealed that more than 90\% of pups in litters
   (N = 11) reared by females that consorted with two or more males were
   sired by a female's first mate. The percentage of young sired by each of
   a female's consorts did not vary with either consortship duration or the
   interval between consortships by different males. Instead, the only
   consistent correlate of paternity was consortship order. Both
   pre-consortship calling and post-consortship defence of females were
   significantly associated with first consortships, suggesting that males
   were able to distinguish unmated females from females that had already
   copulated. Because the probability of siring young should influence
   which females are preferred as mates and how males compete for access to
   those females, comparative studies of sperm precedence patterns may
   yield insights into the evolution of interspecific variation in male
   mating behaviour. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Monitoring soil physical and biological properties may provide useful
   information in assessing the sustainability of agricultural systems, as
   these two components of soil are mainly responsible for improving the
   soil fertility status and higher plant productivity. Soil physical and
   biological properties often change when. different cropping, tillage, or
   management systems other than conventional cultivation practices are
   imposed. The effects of ley cycles on selected soil physical properties
   and biological processes were assessed in the Indian arid zone of
   Jodhpur. Moisture retention and infiltration rates were significantly
   higher with the ley treatments compared with those of the conventionally
   cultivated field (CCF); saturated hydraulic conductivity was lower for
   the different ley treatments. Dehydrogenase, phosphatases, and
   nitrogenase activities were higher for the ley treatments than for the
   CCF treatments. Nitrogenase activity was not detected at 15 to 30 cm
   depth of normal cultivated soil. Continuous forage production for 6 to 8
   years had resulted in an increase in the population of nitrifying
   bacteria, viable VAM spores, organic matter content, and total nitrogen.
   In general, these increases were highest in soils that remained in
   stubble. There was no significant difference between the 6- and 8-year
   ley cycles. Subsurface soil in all the treatments had a lower biological
   activity. The results of the study demonstrated the potential value of
   grass leys for enhancing soil biological processes, moisture retention,
   and infiltration rates. Additionally, the ley treatments improved soil
   fertility status, resulting in significant increases in yields of pearl
   millet grain and straw.}},

Abstract = {{A mass spawning of squid resembles, at first glance, a chaotic `'nuptial
   dance'' (1). But for the first time, we have applied 3-D, radio-linked
   acoustic positioning (RAP) to this confusing process, and our early
   results now reveal a choreography that is, in fact, well organized in
   time and space. Remote tracking with RAP of individual Loligo vulgaris
   reynaudii off South Africa has provided insights into the daily sequence
   of behaviors that lead these animals to aggregate for sexual selection.
   Each dawn, the squid navigate for several kilometers, toward the shore,
   to small, well-defined zones near egg beds on the substrate After
   several hours of circling above these egg beds, a pelagic, 3-D lek-like
   aggregation of large males forms; females are drawn in, and the
   aggregation condenses as the females and males pair, mate, and lay eggs.
   Smaller `'sneaker males'' remain on the periphery of the mating arena
   and from this station, attempt extra-pair copulations (EPCs). The mating
   system of squids is thus unexpectedly complex, rivaling those of mammals
   and birds (2, 3). Commercial squid-jigging fishermen in South Africa
   have recently been attracted to the spawning grounds, and they have been
   successful. Moreover, their activities may be selective for large males.
   Thus, attention should be devoted to ensuring that such targeted fishing
   does not alter the characteristics of squid population genetics. Remote
   tracking and video observations, in combination with genetic analyses,
   may offer a new opportunity to monitor mating effort and reproductive
   success, and thus to manage the fishery.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a survey of the floristic literature, herbarium collections,
   and recent field study, the dune race of Dwarf Cherry, Prunus pumila
   var. pumila, has declined at most of 13 regions of occurrence on the
   Canadian shores of the lower Great Lakes and is considered threatened.
   The disappearances or declines at Lake Ontario sites, and at Long Point
   National Wildlife Area on Lake Erie, and at Finery Provincial Park on
   Lake Huron, all followed very high populations of White-tailed Deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus), and current absence or rarity of the shrub at
   some other locations can also be associated with high deer populations
   in recent times. Deer have had major impacts on herbs and shrubs in some
   of the shoreline parks, and were observed to selectively browse Dwarf
   Cherry. Other factors have probably also played a role in the decline of
   Dwarf Cherry at some sites, including erosion due to high water levels
   and shoreline modifications associated with human use. Accurate
   monitoring of significant natural resources and more effective
   management of deer populations appears necessary to maintain
   biodiversity, not only for posterity and science, but also for potential
   utilization of genetic resources by people.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of blow fly larvae (Protocnlliphora

   Alaska subject to biennially fluctuating prey abundance. Grasshopper
   populations in some regions of interior Alaska can show a strong
   biennial periodicity. Growth of nestling savannah sparrows, numbers of
   blow fly larvae in nests and on nestlings, and grasshopper populations
   were monitored during four breeding seasons (1990-1993) on the Delta
   Agriculture Project site near Delta Junction, Alaska. Growth parameters
   for parasitized and nonparasitized nestlings were compared within and
   between years. There were no significant differences in growth
   parameters between parasitized and nonparasitized nestlings between any
   years. There were also no differences in growth parameters within years,
   except for tarsus length in 1991 and nestling mass in 1993 (low
   grasshopper years); in 1993, parasitized nestlings were heavier and the
   sample size was small. Additionally, there were no differences in
   fledging success within years. Although parasitism combined with other
   factors (e.g., food limitation) may have an impact on avian
   reproduction, our data do not support this.}},

Abstract = {{Maguire primrose (Primula maguirei) is a geographically) restricted
   plant species, known only from a 19-km stretch of Logan Canyon in
   northern Utah (U.S.A). We examined variation at 13 isozymed loci from 25
   individuals of P. maguirei at each of eight sites. At individual loci we
   detected no statistically significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
   proportions within sites (subpopulations). However, some loci were
   almost fixed for different alleles at the upper reaches of the species'
   range relative to populations approximately 10 km away. The total mean
   gene diversity among loci was 0.22, of which 55\% was partitioned within
   subpopulations, 0.7\% among subpopulations within populations (100 m
   spatial scale), 3\% among populations separated by about 1 km, and 41\%
   between an Upper Canyon group of populations and a Lower Canyon group
   (10-km scale). We detected no gametic disequilibria among loci within
   subpopulations (and populations). Two hypotheses are proposed to explain
   the results; (1) past genetic bottlenecks and (2) genetic divergence as
   a by-product and local adaptations to different habitats. Regardless of
   the causes of allozymic differentiation, our results suggest that plans
   for artificial establishment or reestablishment of P. maguirei
   populations should use source populations with 1 km of the establishment
   site. This study emphasizes the potential use of data on population
   genetic structure for managing and monitoring rare species.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The control of predators for nature conservation purposes is becoming an
   increasingly important issue. The growing populations of predator
   species in some areas and the introduction of predators in other areas
   have led to concerns about their impact on vulnerable bird species and
   to the implementation of predator control in some cases. This is set
   against a background of increasingly fragmented semi-natural habitats
   and declining populations for many species. To assess the efficiency of
   predator removal as a conservation measure, the results of 20 published
   studies of predator removal programs were meta-analyzed. Removing
   predators had a large, positive effect on hatching success of the target
   bird species, with removal areas showing higher hatching success, on
   average, than 75\% of the control areas. Similarly, predator removal
   increased significantly post-breeding population sizes (i.e. autumn
   densities) of the target bird species. The effect of predator removal on
   breeding population sizes was not significant, however, with studies
   differing widely in their reported effects. We conclude that predator
   removal often fulfills the goal of game management, which is to enhance
   harvestable post-breeding populations, but that it is much less
   consistent in achieving the usual aim of conservation managers, which is
   to maintain and, where appropriate, increase bird breeding population
   sizes. This may be due to inherent characteristics of avian population
   regulation, but also to ineffective predator removal and inadequate
   subsequent monitoring of the prey populations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents data on aspects of the reproductive ecology of a
   population of Podarcis bocagei in northwestern Spain, as monitored over
   a two-year period (1990-1991). Data were obtained principally on the
   basis of mark-recapture experiments, but also from laboratory hatching
   studies. Mating took place between the end of March and July. During the
   laying period. from May to July, 8.5\% of reproductive females produced
   three clutches, 52.1\% two clutches and 39.4\% one clutch. In general,
   single clutches were produced by small females. Only a small proportion
   of large females produced three clutches. Mean clutch size was 3.8 eggs
   (range 4-7) in May, 4.3 (2-6) in June and 3.9 (2-4) in July. There was
   significant variation in the mean snout-to-vent length (SVL) of females
   laying in each month of the season. Both clutch size and mean single-egg
   volume increased with mother's SVL. There was a significant partial
   correlation between egg volume and clutch size when both mother's SVL
   and month of laying were held constant. There was no significant
   between-year variation in clutch size, breeding females' SVL, egg weight
   or relative clutch mass. A delay in the timing of reproductive events in
   one year (1991) is attributable to adverse weather conditions during
   early spring. Hatching occurred between July and September. Hatch
   success (as estimated in 1989, 1990 and 1991 from natural nests at the
   study site) was high, ranging from 83\% in 1991 to 91\% in 1989. The
   mean SVL of female hatchlings was greater than that of male hatchlings.
   By contrast, adult females had lower mean SVL than adult males.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the surfactant dodecyl alkyl sulphate (C(12)AS) on the
   structure and function of lotic protistan assemblages was examined using
   the Experimental Stream Facility (ESF) operated by the Procter and
   Gamble Company. Population- and community-level responses to C(12)AS
   were monitored on introduced substrates placed in the channels 28 days
   prior to dosing (mature communities) as well as those placed in the
   channels on day 0 of dosing (immature communities), to allow for a broad
   assessment of the effect of the chemical on processes contributing both
   to community development and maintenance. C(12)AS appeared to elicit a
   subsidy response from the native protistan assemblage which may have
   resulted from both positive and negative responses at trophic levels
   above and below the assemblage. Protistan responses to the surfactant
   tended to occur more rapidly and be more sensitive than those documented
   for invertebrates and fish. C(12)AS elicited a modest response (i.e. a
   20\% change) from several reliable parameters including community
   respiration (reduced dissolved oxygen at 289 mu g per L), protozoan
   species richness (increased at 63 mu g per L) and protozoan community
   composition (increased dissimilarity at 1254 mu g per L). Responses to
   C(12)AS exceeded expected exposures in the real world by a factor of six
   or greater thereby indicating that the hazard of exposure to C(12)AS to
   stream communities is low The results of this study support the use of
   mesocosms as decisive tools for evaluating the hazard posed by consumer
   product chemicals to natural communities and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the effects of forest
   application of diflubenzuron (Dimilin(R)), a gypsy moth suppressant, on
   nontarget invertebrates in litter and soil on the forest floor. Four
   experimental watersheds (two treatment and two reference) in the Fernow
   Experimental Forest, West Virginia, were sampled for two years before
   and one year after application of diflubenzuron (70 g ha(-1), Al). Soil
   and leaf litter arthropods were monitored before and after application
   using soil cores and litter bag colonization samplers. Frequency
   analysis, BACIP, and ANOVA were used to analyse the data for
   diflubenzuron treatment effects. During the 36 month study, soil core
   samples were dominated by mites (49\%) and springtails (28\%). A total
   of 19 taxonomic groups were suitable for statistical analysis. We
   detected no significant treatment effects based on total organism counts
   or counts by trophic categories (p < 0.05). There were no significant
   treatment effects for populations of major taxonomic groups, except for
   Araneae (spiders). Analysis of leaf litter bags also showed no
   significant differences in total numbers of invertebrates or in trophic
   categories between treated and reference watersheds during the 12 month
   post-treatment study. Density of one species of springtail (Sminthurus
   purpurescens) and springtails as a group were significantly lower in
   treated watersheds. High variation was associated with both soil core
   and leaf bag samples; because of this variation, a significance level of
   0.05 should be considered very conservative. Long-term trends in soil
   biota were evident, demonstrating the need for well-established
   pre-treatment baseline data for pesticide impacts on soil organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the most biologically productive portions of streams are
   backwater areas which support large populations of benthic
   macroinvertebrates. The sediments in these locations and their
   associated macroinvertebrate communities are frequently subjected to
   chemical inputs and physical perturbations. Historically, assessment of
   the effects of contaminants in sediments have emphasized chemical
   analyses and either laboratory toxicity tests or in-stream monitoring of
   benthic macroinvertebrate community structure. However, combining the
   chemical and biological approaches provides a more powerful assessment
   technique. Such an integrated approach, combining laboratory water-only
   and sediment toxicity tests with Hyalella azteca and Chironomus tentans,
   field surveys of benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and
   evaluation of chemical data using equilibrium partitioning theory was
   used to assess the effects of DDT, DDE and DDD (collectively termed
   DDTR) in the sediments of the Huntsville Spring Branch-Indian Creek
   (HSB-IC) stream system in the southeastern USA. Benthic
   macroinvertebrate populations in the HSB-IC system still appear to be
   adversely affected by DDTR residues within the sediments even though DDT
   discharges to the stream were stopped over 20 years ago and a major
   remediation project was completed in the late 1980s. This conclusion is
   based on a weight of evidence approach which incorporates (1) the
   observed sediment toxicity to C. tentans and H. azteca in laboratory
   tests, (2) the identification of DDTR as the likely cause of effects
   observed during laboratory toxicity tests, (3) the absence of
   appropriate sensitive species from groups such as the Ephemeroptera,
   Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Amphipoda, (4) the presence of reduced
   numbers of both total individuals and species of chironomids and
   oligochaetes relative to nearby streams not contaminated by DDTR and (5)
   the observed distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates in relation to
   organic carbon-normalized concentrations of DDTR and equilibrium
   partitioning-based predicted sediment toxic units of DDTR.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal effects of the pyrethroid insecticide,
   deltamethrin, on populations of cereal aphids and their primary
   parasitoids and hyperparasitoids were investigated in a large scale
   field experiment in winter wheat. Four hectare plots were treated at the
   recommended field concentration or a reduced concentration representing
   one twentieth of field rate. A control plot was left unsprayed.
   Invertebrate populations were sampled at sites within a grid layout
   covering the whole plots, enabling the use of geostatistical analysis.
   Hymenopteran populations were monitored using transparent sticky traps
   and suction sampling. Aphid populations were recorded by visual counts.
   Monitoring continued for 36 days after treatment. The full rate
   deltamethrin treatment resulted in initial reductions of aphid
   populations by 78\%. Primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid populations
   were reduced in suction samples by 90\% and 47\% respectively, when
   corrected for control fluctuations. The reduced deltamethrin
   concentration caused reductions of aphid, primary parasitoid and
   hyperparasitoid populations of 40, 60 and 54\% respectively. Aphid
   population recovery over the full rate plot occurred slowly and in a
   `patchy' manner following treatment. No significant reinvasion gradients
   were detected. Aphid population density recovered more rapidly in the
   reduced rate treatment; with initial evidence for increased densities at
   the plot centre. Significant patterns of reinvasion were initially
   detected for both groups of Hymenoptera in the full rate treatment,
   suggesting that reinvasion of the sprayed area was taking place from
   untreated surrounding reservoirs. It was concluded that experiments that
   examine pesticide impacts within small plots will lead to underestimates
   of effects on dispersive groups including parasitic Hymenoptera.}},

Abstract = {{The aerial dispersal of citrus rust mite, Phyllocoptruta oleivora
   (Ashmead), from Florida citrus groves was monitored throughout the 1995
   growing season, using silicone grease-coated traps. Trap-catch was not
   affected by trap elevation, nor was there a consistent effect of wind
   direction on catch among 3 groves. Significantly more mites were
   captured in vertically oriented than in slanted traps in 2 of the 3
   groves. The seasonal pattern of dispersal showed marked and coincident
   peaks from mid-September through mid-October at the 3 sites. There was a
   strong linear relationship between trap-catch adn population density on
   fruit of 2 of 3 sites and when data from the 3 sites were combined.
   Dispersing mites infected with the entomopathogenic fungus, Hirsutella
   thompsonii Fisher, were captured in traps at the 3 groves, and the peak
   capture of infected mites generally coincided with the peak and decline
   of trap-catch. Mites were captured up to 135 in from an infested grove,
   and the mean +/- SD dispersal distance under the prevailing conditions
   was 10.95 +/- 20.34 m. The majority of mites captured during 1-h
   trapping intervals were alive. These results are discussed in relation
   to the population dynamics of citrus rust mite and to current trends in
   pest management practices in Florida citrus.}},

Abstract = {{The area around the Pribram lead smelter has been recognized to be
   heavily contaminated by lead (Ph). In the early 1970s, several episodes
   of livestock lead intoxication were reported in this area; thereafter,
   several epidemiological and ecological studies focused on exposure of
   children. In contrast to earlier studies, the recent investigation
   (1992-1994) revealed significantly lower exposure to lead. From
   1986-1990, recorded average blood lead levels were about 37.2 mu g lead
   (Pb)/100 mi in an elementary school population living in a neighborhood
   close to the smelter (within 3 km of the plant). The present study,
   however, has found mean blood lead levels of 11.35 mu g/100 mi (95\% CI
   = 9.32; 13.82) among a comparable group of children. In addition to
   blood lead, tooth lead was used to assess exposure among children.
   Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between
   the geometric mean tooth lead level of 6.44 mu g Pb/g (n = 13; 95\% CI =
   3.95; 10.50) in the most contaminated zone and 1.43 mu g Pb/g (n = 35;
   95\% CI = 1.11; 1.84) in zones farther away from the point source. Both
   biomarkers, blood and tooth lead levels, reflect a similar pattern of
   lead exposure in children. This study has attempted a quantitative
   assessment of risk factors associated with elevated lead exposure in the
   Czech Republic. Content of lead in soil, residential distance from the
   smelter, consumption of locally grown vegetables or fruits, drinking
   water from local wells, the mother's educational level, cigarette
   consumption among family members, and the number of children in the
   family were factors positively related (p<0.05) to blood lead levels.
   The resulting blood lead level was found to be inversely proportional to
   the child's age.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the impact of elevated levels of inorganic mercury in soil and
   dust and organic mercury in fish, biological monitoring was conducted
   among Native Americans living next to an inactive mercury mine in Clear
   Lake, California. Of resident tribal members, 46\% (n = 56) participated
   in biomonitoring. Urine mercury levels are equivalent to background,
   indicating that soil and dust exposures among study participants are not
   substantial. The average blood organic mercury level among study
   participants is 15.6 +/- 8.8 mu g/l (n = 44), which is higher than
   levels reported by others among those who do not consume fish (2 mu
   g/l). Consistent with results from other studies, a correlation between
   fish consumption and blood organic mercury is observed (p = 0.03). The
   margin between observed and established adverse effect levels for adults
   is examined for blood organic mercury and found to be less than 10-fold
   for 20\% of the study population. Protective public health efforts for
   the study population and other similarly exposed populations, notably
   those who consume commercial fish products, are considered.}},

Abstract = {{The concept that depleted populations of marine fishes can be
   revitalized by releasing cultured fish is being tested in Hawaii. In
   this study we evaluated effects of interaction between release season
   and size-at-release on recapture rates of cultured striped mullet, Mugil
   cephalus, released into Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Over 90,000 cultured M.
   cephalus fingerlings, ranging in size from 45 to 130 mm total length,
   were tagged with binary coded-wire tags. Half were released in spring,
   the remainder in summer. In both seasons, releases were made in three
   replicate lots. In each replicate, five size intervals of fish were
   released at two nursery habitats in Kaneohe Bay. Monthly cast-net
   collections were made in 6 nursery habitats over a 45-week period to
   monitor recapture rates, growth, and dispersal of cultured fish.
   Recapture rate was directly affected by the seasonal timing of releases.
   Greatest recovery of the smallest fish released (individuals <60 mm)
   occurred following spring releases and coincided with peak recruitment
   of similar-size wild M. cephalus juveniles. In contrast, recovery of
   fish that were <60 mm at release was very poor after summer releases.
   Overall survival was similar at both release sites. We hypothesize that
   survival of released cultured fish will be greater when releases are
   timed so that fish size-at-release coincides with modes in the size
   structure of wild stocks. To optimize effectiveness of stock enhancement
   as a fishery-management tool, pilot release-recapture experiments should
   be conducted to evaluate effects of release season on size-dependent
   recovery of released animals.}},

Abstract = {{1. The correlation between climatic variables and past (up to 20 years)
   growth was studied in seven circumarctic populations of the moss
   Hylocomium splendens, using retrospective analyses of growth. We
   hypothesized that relationships between growth and climate would be
   simpler in an ectohydric moss than in higher plants and that the moss
   could provide high signal-to-noise ratios of responses to climatic
   variation.
   2. Growth parameters of the moss were strongly correlated with early
   summer temperatures and with the length of the growing season. Annual
   segment mass, growth rates and degeneration rates were highest at the
   mildest subarctic sites and lowest at the high arctic site. In contrast,
   `longevity' (age of the oldest segment) increased at the climatically
   harsher sites.
   3. Between-year growth variations at two contrasting sites were
   significantly correlated with June and July temperatures and, to a
   lesser extent, with early-season precipitation at one of the sites.
   4. The moss currently tolerates a wide range of climates and large
   interannual variations in temperature and is likely to be at risk from
   climatic change only at the southern edge of its range.
   5. The climate-change component most likely to affect the growth of H.
   splendens in the Arctic and Subarctic will be a lengthening of the
   growing season and in increase in early summer temperatures provided
   that moisture is not limiting.
   6. Hylocomium splendens is a suitable species for monitoring climatic
   change at a circumarctic scale.}},

Title = {{Growth and reproduction of aphids and levels of free amino acids in
   Scots pine and Norway spruce in an open-air fumigation with ozone}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{To estimate the susceptibility of conifer seedlings to aphids under
   future tropospheric ozone levels, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and
   Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings were exposed to
   ambient and elevated ozone levels in an open-air exposure system. Growth
   and reproduction of the aphids Schizolachnus pineti and Cinara pinea on
   Scots pine and Cinara pilicornis on Norway spruce were monitored. Levels
   of free amino acids in foliage and young shoots were used as indicators
   of host plant quality. In elevated treatment plots the ozone doses were
   between 1.2 and 1.7 times the dose in ambient plots in 1990-93. Half of
   the seedling material in 1992-93 was subjected to nitrogen fertilization
   treatment to evaluate the effects of increased N deposition.
   In 1990, population density of S. pineti on pine did not differ between
   ambient and elevated ozone treatments during growing season, but
   remained higher in the elevated ozone plot than in the ambient plot at
   the end of the growing season. This was associated with elevated levels
   of glutamic acid in foliage. In August 1992, the numbers of S. pineti
   were consistent between the two ambient ozone plots, but deviated highly
   between the two ozone-fumigated plots. Glycine concentration in pine
   foliage was elevated by ozone, but free amino acid concentrations were
   not related to aphid performance. In 1993, ozone and nitrogen did not
   significantly affect the relative growth rate (RGR) of S. pineti or C.
   pinea nymphs on Scots pine, but glutamic acid concentration in foliage
   was increased by nitrogen fertilization. On Norway spruce, fecundity of
   C. pilicornis females was higher in elevated ozone treatment, but RGR of
   nymphs was not affected in 1992. In 1993, RGR of C. pilicornis nymphs
   was increased by nitrogen fertilization in June, but not affected by
   ozone. Nitrogen fertilization increased the levels of total free amino
   acids, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and proline in elongating shoots of
   Norway spruce, and ozone reduced the concentrations of valine and
   gamma-butyric acid.
   Our results suggest that availability of nitrogen from soil has a
   stronger impact on the concentrations of free amino acids in conifer
   seedlings than ozone. Some episodes of high ozone concentration may
   increase free amino acids in foliage. Aphid response to ozone was
   extremely variable, in agreement with previous laboratory experiments.
   The expected 20-70\% increase in ambient concentrations of tropospheric
   ozone may in some occasions enhance aphid performance on Scots pine and
   Norway spruce seedlings, but in most cases the ozone effect on the
   susceptibility of conifer seedlings to sucking insect pests is not
   important.}},

Abstract = {{A housing estate was built immediately adjacent to two water bodies
   utilized by crested newts (Triturus cristatus). Conservation management,
   particularly pond deepening and fish removal, was undertaken during and
   after development. This paper describes a monitoring study to determine
   the success of the operation. Counting adults at night in the breeding
   season indicated that numbers were at least maintained over a ten year
   period. Larval counts were made in each of the seven years after the
   houses were constructed, and more than half of the larvae were netted in
   one year, 1991. In the autumn of 1990 both ponds were totally dry, and
   success in 1991 may have been associated with absence of fish and low
   numbers of invertebrate predators. The overall conclusion was that it is
   possible to conserve crested newts satisfactorily in such a situation.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitoids, pathogens, and predators of lepidopterans were monitored

   near Blackville, South Carolina. Chemical (permethrin at 0.0225 kg
   {[}AI]/ha) control of early-season green cloverworm, Plathypena scabra
   (F.), in soybean fields did not have an impact on predator population
   density later in the season when compared with untreated control fields.
   Chemical control of green cloverworm did not affect incidence of the
   entomopathogenic fungus Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) Samson in subsequently
   occurring lepidopteran populations during 1985 when green cloverworm and
   soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker), populations overlapped.
   However, its incidence was enhanced in soybean looper populations in
   untreated fields during September 1986 when green cloverworm did not
   occur in an overlapping generation with soybean looper. Cotesia
   marginiventris (Cresson) was the most prevalent parasitoid, and its
   parasitism of soybean looper was not dependent upon its prior occurrence
   in green cloverworm populations.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the relationship of pre-bloom captures of adult

   traps stapled in vertical position at knee height to south sides of tree
   trunks with densities of first-generation larvae on foliage in 32
   commercial apple orchard blocks that received no pesticide treatment
   against the first generation. Regression analysis revealed a highly
   significant linear relationship between cumulative adult trap captures
   from the silver tip to the tight cluster stage of bud development and
   densities of first-generation larvae (r(2) = 0.645). The same was true
   for cumulative adult trap captures from the silver tip to the full pink
   stage of bud development (r(2) = 0.838). In neither case was there a
   significant quadratic relationship between these variables. Action
   thresholds of 7 and 14 first-generation larvae per 100 leaves translated
   into action thresholds of a cumulative of 4 and 8 adult trap captures,
   respectively, from silver tip to tight cluster and a cumulative of 9 and
   21 adult trap captures, respectively, from silver tip to full pink. We
   describe advantages offered by sticky red rectangles attached to tree

   within the Saxton population in California were resistant to
   esfenvalerate. An egg bioassay indicated that azinphosmethyl did not
   provide effective control at commercial application rates. In larval

Abstract = {{Fourteen soybean genotypes in maturity groups VII and VIII were
   evaluated for resistance to Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Perring and
   Trialeurodes abutilonea (Haldeman) at 2 field locations in Tift County,
   Georgia, in 1993 and 1994. Significant differences in mean whitefly
   densities were observed among the 14 soybean genotypes. `Perrin',
   `Cook', and `N88-91' had significantly lower mean numbers of whiteflies
   than many of the other entries during both seasons at both test sites.
   Fewer B. argentifolii eggs were oviposited on these 3 soybean entries
   compared with the susceptible varieties `Braxton' and `Cobb',
   demonstrating an antixenosis plant resistance response. The soybean
   breeding lines `N89-1' and `F90-724' also were highly preferred hosts
   for B. argentifolii oviposition. Much lower T. abuttlonea population
   densities were observed; however, the same general trends in host
   preference were observed. More than 70\% of the mean whitefly population
   was composed of B. argentifolii in 1993 and 95\% was B. argentifolii in
   1994. Sticky traps were used to monitor the presence of both species of
   adults in the field and to determine when peak adult populations
   occurred. Trap captures were low in June of both years and rose steadily
   until whitefly densities peaked in mid-to late September.}},

   Significantly more tarnished plant bugs, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de
   Beauvois), and percentage of crazy cotton were observed in B.
   thuringiensis 757 (Coker 312 background in 1994) and in Coker 312
   variety in 1995 compared with other varieties, suggesting no effect of
   B. thuringiensis gene insertion in cotton on the number of tarnished
   plant bugs. Transgenic cotton had significantly fewer bollworms and
   budworms, cabbage loopers {[}Trichoplusia ni (Hubner)], and percentage
   of damaged squares than the other varieties, 75\% as many beet armyworms
   {[}Spodoptera exigua (Hubner)], and had no effect on fall armyworm
   {[}Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith)]. The transgenic character itself
   did not cause an increase of any insect population, but consultants and
   producers are encouraged to monitor other insect pests, especially boil
   weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, and tarnished plant bug.
   These pests may cause economic damage when fewer or no sprays are used
   for bollworm and budworm in cotton. Nectariless MD51 had fewer plant
   bugs than other varieties both years, but also lower yield. These
   results suggest transgenic cotton is a useful tool in the management of
   certain lepidopterous pests.}},

Abstract = {{Photochemical modeling and ambient monitoring of ground-level ozone
   concentrations provide two alternative/complementary methods for
   calculating potential population exposure estimates, A comparative
   evaluation of these methods was undertaken over a study area comprised
   of the entire state of New Jersey and neighboring parts of Delaware,
   Maryland Pennsylvania and New York. Kriging, a geostatistical
   interpolation technique, was used for the interpolation of hourly ozone
   data from 38 air quality monitoring stations operating within the study
   area, to derive concentration fields for the entire domain. The Urban
   Airshed Model (UAM-IV), a comprehensive photochemical grid-based model,
   was then used to calculate the same concentrations from emissions and
   meteorology inputs. Concentration fields, thus developed, were linked
   with corresponding population data to calculate potential population
   exposure estimates to outdoor ozone (E-p,E-o). The adequacy of kriging
   as an interpolation technique was evaluated by comparing E-p,E-o
   estimates derived via photochemical UAM modeling with those calculated
   by using concentrations obtained from kriging UAM-calculated values at
   the locations of the monitoring stations. In general, UAM was found to
   predict higher E-p,E-o compared to those derived by kriging
   observations. In order to test the robustness of the interpolation
   methodology with respect to assumptions of statistical correlation, two
   different semivariogram models, spherical and exponential, were used for
   kriging. Application of the different semivariograms yielded almost
   identical E-p,E-o patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Insecticide degradation and pest survival were monitored in treated
   stored wheat and maize in southern Manitoba. Wheat stored in two wooden
   bins each holding 2.4 tonnes of grain was treated with the insecticide
   chlorpyrifos-methyl at calculated levels of 5 ppm; untreated wheat was
   placed in two other identical bins in the same granary. Maize was
   simultaneously stored in four identical bins each holding 2.3 tomes of
   grain in another granary and the maize in two of these bins was treated
   with the insecticide pirimiphos-methyl at calculated levels of 6 ppm.
   Monthly samples were taken from the top and at 1 m depths of the grain
   bulks for Ig months. Grain surface temperatures fluctuated with ambient
   air conditions, but at 1 m depth tagged behind top temperatures.
   Moisture content of the wheat ranged from 12.2 to 15.1\% and the maize
   from 12.1 to 15.3\% over 18 months. Chlorpyrifos-methyl residues on
   wheat declined 51 and 38\% at the top and Im depths, respectively.
   Pirimiphos-methyl residues on maize did not decrease; however, after 8
   months, pirimiphos-methyl began to appreciably lose effectiveness
   against the insect Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) in 24 h laboratory
   bioassays, and after a year against T. castaneum and the mite Tarsonemus
   granarius Lindquist within the granaries. Fat acidity values increased
   in both wheat and maize and insecticide treatments were not directly
   related to the increases. Under western Canadian conditions
   chlorpyrifos-methyl applied on wheat degraded with time, but at 4.6 ppm,
   offered effective insect control (>90\%) for 10 months.
   Pirimiphos-methyl (5.6 ppm) on maize killed > 90\% of insects for 8
   months. It did not degrade at either the surface or Im depth, but became
   less effective with time, based on short-term exposure of adults,
   possibly because of translocation into the seed. (C) 1997 Published by

Abstract = {{The probabilistic National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
   Exposure Model applied to carbon monoxide (pNEM/CO) was developed by the
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to estimate frequency
   distributions of population exposure to carbon monoxide (GO) and the
   resulting carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels. To evaluate pNEM/CO, the
   model was set up to simulate CO exposure data collected during a Denver
   Personal Exposure Monitoring Study (PEM) conducted during the winter of
   1982-1983. This paper compares computer-simulated exposure distributions
   obtained by pNEM/CO with the observed cumulative relative frequency
   distributions of population exposure to CO from 779 people in the Denver
   PEM study.
   The subjects were disaggregated into two categories depending upon
   whether they Lived in a home with a gas stove or an electric stove. The
   observed and predicted population exposure frequency distributions were
   compared in terms of 1-hr daily maximum exposure (1DME) and 8-hr daily
   maximum moving average exposure (8DME) for people Living in homes with
   gas stove or an electric stove. For 1DME, the computer-simulated results
   from pNEM/CO agreed most closely within the range of 6-13 ppm, but
   overestimated occurrences at low exposure (<6 ppm) and underestimated
   occurrences at high exposure (>13 ppm). For 8DME, the predicted
   exposures agreed best with observed exposures in the range of CO
   concentration between 5.5 and 7 ppm, and over-predicted occurrences
   below 5.5 ppm and under-predicted occurrences above 7 ppm.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the threat posed by introduced raccoons (Procyon lotor) to
   native, burrow-nesting seabirds of the Queen Charlotte Islands, British
   Columbia. In 1991, eve described and quantified raccoon predation within
   a 14.9-ha colony of about 1,200 pairs of ancient murrelets
   (Synthliboramphus antiquus). An estimated 3-4 raccoons were present on
   the island. We obtained radiolocations and sightings for one female and
   one male throughout the seabird breeding season, and investigated these
   locations for evidence of predatory activity. Eleven of 15 such
   investigations led to fresh evidence of predation on ancient murrelets,
   such as dug burrows, broken eggs, and one or more decapitated adults,
   suggesting that raccoons were responsible for these types of predation
   sign. The estimated predation from all sources within the seabird colony
   by conducting transect surveys. These covered about 17\% of the colony
   area, and were carried out every third afternoon from 8 April to 8 June.
   Twenty-one surveys yielded 6 headless carcasses, 77 feather piles, 30
   broken eggs, 2 dead chicks, and 20 dug burrows, representing an
   estimated loss of 488 +/- 110 adult and subadult birds, and 188 +/- 102
   eggs and chicks within the colony (95\% CL). Estimates of raccoon
   predation based on the number of headless carcasses and diggings found
   on transects were 35 +/- 35 and 71 +/- 42, however, these are considered
   underestimates because they do not account for the rapid conversion of
   seabird carcasses by avian scavengers, or the capture of birds
   aboveground. Monitoring of seabird remains indicated that about 92\% (n
   = 38) of headless carcasses were consumed or converted to feather piles
   by avian scavengers within <3 days, indicating that the number of
   carcasses found on predation transect surveys could underestimate
   raccoon predation by as much as an order of magnitude. The suggestion
   that raccoons were responsible for most seabird losses is supported by
   changes in the level of predation recorded between years. Predation
   levels were similar in 1990 and 1991, in the presence of raccoons, and
   declined by 80\% in 1992, following the removal of 3 raccoons. Raccoon
   predation represents a conservation threat of international
   significance, because the Queen Charlotte Islands contain the majority
   of the world's ancient murrelet population, as well as substantial
   populations of several other burrow-nesting species that are also
   susceptible to raccoon predation.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of migrating birds potentially could be used to detect population
   change. This technique would be especially valuable for tracking species
   poorly monitored by breeding and wintering season counts, such as
   boreal-nesting songbirds that winter in the tropics. Numbers of migrants
   counted vary with weather and other factors, however, and we need to
   demonstrate that migration counts give accurate results. Population
   trends for 1979-91 were calculated for 13 songbird species captured
   during autumn mist netting at 2 sites in southern Michigan. AII species
   were northern-nesters occurring at the study sites only as transients.
   Annual indices of abundance were derived from a multiple regression of
   daily number of newly-captured birds on independent variables for date,
   weather, moon phase and year. Trends in the annual capture indices were
   significantly and positively correlated with trends in breeding bird
   survey (BBS) data from presumed breeding grounds in Michigan and
   Ontario, and were of similar magnitude. The results suggest that
   intensive, standardized netting can be a useful population monitoring
   tool.}},

Abstract = {{We designed and conducted an aerial survey for monitoring trends in duck
   populations in Florida during January. The state's wetland habitats were
   represented by a stratified random sample of 150 62.2-km(2) units.
   Statewide estimates for total ducks averaged about 538,000 during
   1989-93. Total dabbling duck population estimates averaged 117,000, and
   total diving duck estimates averaged 399,000. Annual population
   estimates generally were imprecise (coefficients of variation {[}CVs]
   averaged 0.52 and ranged from 0.20 to 0.97), resulting in generally low
   probability (<0.70) of detecting annual rates of change of <0.09 over
   10-years (alpha = 0.10). Serial correlation of population estimates from
   repeated sampling of survey units potentially inflated Type I error
   rates above the nominal alpha = 0.10 level, and were accounted for in
   our analyses by specifying lower alpha levels for rejection. We
   recommend that winter surveys of ducks be spatially replicated to assure
   CV (25\% of annual abundance estimates: Replicates should be randomly
   drawn each year of the survey to avoid serial correlation in the
   estimates; if precluded by logistical constraints, investigators should
   estimate, ideally through simulation, the effect of serial correlation
   on Type I error rates.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of survival for adult moose (Alces alces) are presented by
   sex, season, and calendar year (CY) for 204 (66 M, 138 F) radiocollared
   adult moose monitored from aircraft in lower Susitna River Valley (LSRV)
   in southcentral Alaska during May 1980 through February 1991. Deaths
   were attributed to capture problems, hunter kills, defense of human life
   or property (DHLP), illegal harvest, collisions with trains, and
   unverified other causes. Capture-related deaths were not included in
   survival analyses. Hunter kills were mainly censored from survival
   calculations. Moose were censored from the study for loss of signal
   contact and shed radiocollars. Summer survival curves did not differ
   among CYs for females (P = 0.501) or for males (P = 0.819) or among
   sexes (CYs pooled; P = 0.817). Autumn survival curves did not differ
   among CYs for females (P = 0.617) or for males (P = 0.617); a difference
   was detected among sexes (CYs pooled; P < 0.001) with survival higher
   for females (0.98, SE = 0.007) than for males (0.90, SE = 0.032). We
   speculate that lower autumn survival in males was from bullet wounding,
   wounding from rut-related fights with other bull moose, illegal harvest,
   and fatal encounters with bears. Survival in winter and annual survival
   varied by sex and CY and was affected largely by mortality associated
   with accumulation of snow. Given low densities of wolves and no
   observations of wolf sign at mortality sites we contend that
   malnutrition was the main cause of mortality in deep snow winters.
   Nonhunting deaths of male moose in winter was not correlated negatively
   with hunter kills of males in the precious autumn-early winter. Moose
   managers should be cognizant of nonhunting mortality of males in autumn
   and snow conditions through mid-May to evaluate animal survival and to
   accurately predict size and composition of post-winter populations.
   Moose management programs should be sufficiently responsive to modify
   autumn harvest quotas in accordance with survival data collected the
   previous winter 5 months after autumn post-hunt population surveys.}},

   treatment was replicated 4 times in a systematic research design. The
   patches in both treatments contained high-quality habitat surrounded by
   low-quality matrix. Six pairs of adult meadow voles were released in
   each enclosure on 27 May 1993. Populations were monitored by
   live-trapping and radio-telemetry methods. Significantly greater
   densities of female voles were found during October in the fragmented
   treatment compared to the nonfragmented treatment. Also, significantly
   more females than males were found in the fragmented treatment compared
   to the nonfragmented treatment for the total study period. Significantly
   more subadult and juvenile males were found in the matrix versus the
   patch of the nonfragmented treatment compared to the fragmented
   treatment. Males in the fragmented treatment had significantly greater
   mean home range size than males or females in the nonfragmented
   treatment. There appears to exist a relationship between patch
   fragmentation and the social structure of meadow vole populations; this
   relationship appears to function as a population regulatory mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{During the dry season (early May through September of 1994), following a
   fall 1993 wildfire, a survey of seedling nodulation was conducted at
   several sites in the Santa Monica Mountains of Southern California.
   Seedlings of Ceanothus spinosus, C. megacarpus, C. oliganthus, and C.
   cuneatus were manually excavated. During this period, only 12 of the 182
   seedlings excavated were nodulated, and all of the nodulated seedlings
   were found in the relatively moist clay soils of a stream bank. No
   nodules were observed on the 170 seedlings excavated from the drier
   sires. An irrigation experiment was established in midsummer to assess
   whether water stress inhibits nodulation of post-fire Ceanothus
   seedlings. Flour plots with numerous seedlings of C. cuneatus and C.
   spinosus were irrigated with distilled water and monitored over a 9-week
   period. There was a significant increase in nodulation frequency, water
   potential, stomatal conductance, transpiration, shoot elongation, and
   photosynthetic rate of irrigated seedlings compared with adjacent
   controls. Although these data support the hypothesis that water stress
   inhibits nodulation, it is unclear whether this is because of an effect
   of soil moisture on the nodulation capacity of the soils (i.e. on the
   size and physiological state of the soil Frankia population) or to a
   host plant response to drought which might prevent actinorhizal root
   infection and/or nodule development.}},

Abstract = {{The foraging behaviour of sub-adult Nucella lapillus originating from
   different field populations, was monitored for ten alternating,
   biweekly, periods of calm and wave action simulated in a tidal aquarium.
   Because the dogwhelks were reared under standard laboratory conditions,
   any behavioural differences among the experimental populations could
   reasonably be inferred to be linked to some genetically based mechanism.
   In order to forage, the dogwhelks had to leave a refugium, traverse
   empty `habitat' and enter a patch of mussels serving as prey. Wave
   action markedly depressed foraging activity, increased foraging latency
   and lowered the patch-residence-time index. Dogwhelks derived;from
   populations naturally occurring on shores exposed to wave action reduced
   their foraging activity less strongly than those derived from
   sheltered-shore populations, but geographical origin (Plymouth or
   Anglesey) had no significant influence on foraging behaviour. A simple
   interpretation was offered, linking the differential behavioural
   response to habitat-specific shell morphology, known to be heritable.
   According to this interpretation, all dogwhelks react similarly to the
   drag forces generated by wave action, but the relatively shorter-spired
   shells of exposed-shore dogwhelks cause weaker resultant forces than the
   taller-spired shells of sheltered-shore individuals. Consequently,
   exposed-shore dogwhelks tolerate higher levels of wave action than
   sheltered-shore morphs before suppressing their foraging behaviour. As
   exposed-shore dogwhelks have greater tenacity associated with relatively
   larger pedal area, the increased tolerance of wave action extends
   opportunities for foraging without incurring extra risk of dislodgement.
   The sheltered-shore morphology, which imparts greater resistance to
   desiccation, coincidentally increases drag and so makes dogwhelks more
   likely to seek refuge during occasional periods of heavy wave action.
   Exposed- and sheltered-shore morphologies therefore represent
   genotype-environment interaction that is apparently adaptive, in part,
   through its effect on foraging behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the association between daily morbidity and respirable
   particulate pollution (i.e., particles with a mass median aerodynamic
   diameter of less than or equal to 10 microns {[}PM(10)]) was evaluated
   in the general population of Anchorage, Alaska. Using insurance claims
   data for state employees and their dependents who lived in Anchorage,
   Alaska, the authors determined the number of medical visits for asthma,
   bronchitis, and upper respiratory infections. The number of visits were
   related to the level of particulate pollution in ambient air measured at
   air-monitoring sites. This study was conducted during a 3-y period,
   which included several weeks of higher-level particulate pollution that
   resulted from a volcanic eruption (i.e., August 1992). The particulate
   pollution was measured by the Anderson head sampler (24-h accumulation).
   The medical visits of the population at risk were also tallied daily. To
   help confirm whether PM(10) exposure was a risk factor in the
   exacerbation of asthma, we used a regression analysis to regress daily
   asthma visits on PM(10) pollution levels, controlling for seasonal
   variability. A significant positive association between morbidity and
   PM(10) pollution was observed. The strongest association was with
   concurrent-day PM(10) levels. The relative risk of morbidity was higher
   with respect to PM(10) pollution during warmer days.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies quantified predation on Colorado potato beetle
   {[}Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)] eggs and determined the relationship
   between predation and egg mass abundance in research and commercial
   potato plantings in eastern North Carolina. Predator exclusion
   experiments were conducted weekly in research plantings. In addition,
   egg mass density and predation on egg masses were monitored throughout
   the season in research plots and commercial potato fields. Predation was
   an important source of mortality for Colorado potato beetle eggs.
   Survivorship of eggs exposed to predators was consistently,
   significantly lower than survivorship of eggs protected from predation.
   Averaged over 2 years, the mean survivorship of eggs protected from
   predation was 69\%, compared with 26\% survivorship of eggs exposed to
   predation. Regression analysis failed to detect any relationship between
   egg mortality due to predation and egg abundance. These results imply
   that efforts to reduce Colorado potato beetle populations selectively
   will not be offset by an according decline in abundance of natural
   enemies and therefore should be fully compatible with naturally
   occurring biological control. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Pitfall traps were used to monitor the activity of ants in a forest
   floor and a one-year-old fallow plot in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, at monthly
   intervals between November 1980 and October 1981. Similar studies were
   carried out between October 1987 and June 1988. These studies also
   included manual collection of ants from the floor of the experimental
   plots. Of all the 10 species of ants recorded, Pheidole crassinoda was
   the most abundant in the forest and fallow plots both in 1980-81 and
   1987-88. P. crassinoda accounted for 52 percent and 88 percent of the
   ant populations collected manually from the forest and fallow plots
   respectively between December 1987 and June 1988. This species was also
   significantly higher in the pitfall catches of the fallow than the
   forest plots. Pitfall traps were not effective in sampling the
   populations of the belligerent Dorylus nigricans. The data are
   consistent with the widely accepted notion that forested areas support
   less ants than unforested areas. Differences in physical habitat
   characteristics, food availability, nesting habits, predation and
   microenvironmental factors were considered responsible for the
   differences in activities and abundance of ants in the forest and fallow
   plots.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of an intertidal assemblage of macroalgae and sessile
   macrofauna was monitored following a rare occurrence of scouring by sea
   ice on an exposed rocky shore near Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The
   ice-scour denuded the substratum at all intertidal levels, and the
   objective of this study was to determine whether the assemblage would
   return to its original structure. Sampling was done along a 10 m
   transect at about yearly intervals from 7 months before to 5 years and 7
   months after the ice-scour. Ephemeral algae blanketed the shore soon
   after the ice-scour, but these were replaced by perennial macroalgae in
   less than two years. The characteristic zonation of the macroalgae on
   the shore before the ice-scour, with a successive replacement of Fucus
   spp. from the high to mid-shore regions and Chondrus crispus low on the
   shore, was restored in only two years. The cover of macroalgae at
   mid-intertidal heights (Fucus vesiculosus, F. evanescens) was
   re-established more rapidly than the cover high (F. spiralis) or low
   (Chondrus crispus) on the shore. The barnacle Semibalanus balanoides
   covered less than 10\% of the shore before and soon after the ice-scour,
   and except in the year following the ice-scour when barnacles settled in
   large densities low on the shore, they were restricted to the mid- and
   high shore regions. Mussels (Mytilus edulis and/or M. trossulus) covered
   more than 50\% of the shore before the ice-scour, and their rate of
   recolonisation was inversely related to height on the shore. After about
   four years, the cover of mussels in the low and mid-shore regions was
   similar to that before the ice-scour, but even after almost six years
   the cover of mussels high on the shore remained less than that before
   the ice-scour. Many of the observations made during the recovery of this
   assemblage, such as the rate and sequence of replacements of species at
   particular heights on the shore, paralleled the results of experimental
   studies done at much smaller spatial scales within similar, established
   assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Trawl surveys using stratified random designs are widely used on the
   east coast of North America to monitor groundfish populations.
   Statistical quantities estimated from these surveys are derived via a
   randomization basis and do not require that a probability model be
   postulated for the data. However, the large sample properties of these
   estimates may not be appropriate for the small sample sizes and skewed
   data characteristic of bottom trawl surveys. In this paper, three
   bootstrap resampling strategies that incorporate complex sampling
   designs are used to explore the properties of estimates for small sample
   situations. A new form for the bias-corrected and accelerated confidence
   intervals is introduced for stratified random surveys. Simulation
   results indicate that the bias-corrected and accelerated confidence
   limits may overcorrect for the trawl survey data and that percentile
   limits were closer to the expected values. Nonparametric density
   estimates were used to investigate the effects of unusually large
   catches of fish on the bootstrap estimates and confidence intervals.
   Bootstrap variance estimates decreased as increasingly smoother
   distributions were assumed for the observations in the stratum with the
   large catch. Lower confidence limits generally increased with increasing
   smoothness but the upper bound depended upon assumptions about the shape
   of the distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) inhabiting the southern portion of
   Lake of the Woods and the Rainy River, a north-temperate watershed
   straddling the Canada - United States border, were studied to test
   hypotheses concerning seasonal movement patterns, including spawning
   migrations, and habitat use. We implanted radio transmitters into 26
   fish and monitored seasonal movements during 3 consecutive years. Data
   indicated the existence of two discrete populations of sturgeon in this
   watershed, differentiated by seasonal habitat use, movement patterns and
   rates, and timing of spawning. The `'lake'' population, a designation
   suggested by a consistent preference for lentic winter habitat, appeared
   to spawn and initiate extensive spring and summer movements later than
   the `'river'' population, which consistently inhabited the river during
   the winter months. Overall, movement rates were significantly greater in
   the spring and summer months than at other times of the year and
   decreased with water temperature. General preferences exhibited by lake
   sturgeon for certain habitat types at different times of the year
   appeared to be linked to foraging behaviour. The results suggest that
   population differentiation may be prevalent for this species inhabiting
   large lake-river systems, given some diversity in habitat structure and
   spawning cues. In management efforts, this potential should be taken
   into consideration and reflected.}},

Abstract = {{From the 1930s through 1977, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used
   in manufacturing processes at an industrial facility in Pittsfield,
   Massachusetts (USA). While use of PCBs was discontinued in 1977,
   inadvertent releases prior to that time were conveyed to the Housatonic
   River and deposited in river sediments downstream of the facility.
   During periodic flooding, river sediments containing PCBs were deposited
   on soils of the 10-year floodplain within an area managed for wildlife
   conservation. Based on investigative reports of the study area,
   concentrations of PCBs in surficial floodplain soil (top 15 cm) in the
   river reach containing that area range from non-detect to 75 mg/kg, with
   a mean of 12 mg/kg, while PCB concentrations in the surficial sediments
   in this reach of the river range from 0.04 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg, with a
   mean of 33 mg/kg. Pursuant to the Massachusetts Contingency Plan and the
   Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, an ecological risk assessment
   was designed to evaluate the potential risk of harm posed to the
   ecosystem by the contaminated floodplain soils. Some of the studies
   included in this risk assessment have been completed. One such study
   focused on reproductive success of passerine (i.e., songbird)
   populations. This assessment endpoint was evaluated based on comparisons
   of clutch sizes, numbers of eggs hatched, and hatching success of eight
   species of songbirds living within the floodplain (target population) to
   those of reference populations nesting outside of the floodplain and to
   ranges reported in the scientific literature. Approximately 300 natural
   nests were monitored throughout the 1993 breeding season and
   reproductive outcome was evaluated on both an overall basis and a
   species-specific basis. Clutch sizes and numbers of young hatched were
   not significantly different between target and reference groups for
   individual species, although sample sizes were generally small. Mean
   clutch sizes plus or minus one standard deviation were well within
   normal ranges reported in the literature for all species considered and
   for both target and reference groups. Hatching success of reference and
   target nests was 88.4 percent and 87.4 percent, respectively, a
   difference that is not statistically significant (p=0.77). This endpoint
   was examined for the target and reference communities rather than
   individual species, and sample sizes were 45 and 60 for reference and
   target groups, respectively. Overall, PCBs in the Housatonic River
   system do not appear to be adversely affecting reproduction in songbirds
   at the community level. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{PCBs were widely used in the 1970s in Finland. PCB usage was regulated
   the following decade and is presently strongly restricted. The reduction
   of PCB loading is generally observed as decreasing concentrations in
   environmental indicator species. The decreasing trend is seen clearly in
   the 25-year-long monitoring of northern pike in large lakes. The level
   of PCBs was approximately 5 to 15 mu g g(-1) (lipid weight) in the early
   1970s, while present concentrations generally range from 0.5 to 3 mu g
   g(-1)(l.w.). In recent years, increasing concern about the pollution of
   Arctic areas by airborne contaminants has led to an expansion of
   monitoring of persistent contaminants in northern areas. Arctic char
   (Salvelinus alpinus, L.) has been used as a circumpolar indicator
   species in the fresh water of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment
   Programme. The level of PCBs in char was determined in two small
   subarctic lakes in northern Finland and were 0.1 and 0.5 mu g
   g(-1)(l.w.). There are several possible reasons for the variation
   between lakes: population density; growth conditions; nutrient level,
   and catching time. The PCB congener pattern is very similar in the fish
   samples of all large lakes and one small subarctic lake in spite of wide
   geographical coverage. The dominant congeners in these samples are IUPAC

Abstract = {{We investigated whether pollen deposited onto stigmas limited female
   reproductive success in the hummingbird-pollinated, short-lived,
   iteroparous, Silene virginica (Caryophyllaceae). The study was conducted
   over a 4-yr span in a population occurring in a woodland area and over a
   3-yr span in a second population occurring in a nearby open meadow. We
   contrasted average fruit set, seed set per fruit, and total annual seed
   production (in only the woodland site) between open-pollinated control
   plants and hand-pollinated experimental plants. We also followed
   surviving individuals in subsequent years and repeated the same
   treatments on plants when they flowered. All plants were monitored
   annually for survival and reproduction at both sites; growth was
   monitored at only the woodland site because of extensive herbivory in
   the meadow population.
   Lack of pollen deposited onto stigmas significantly limited reproductive
   potential at the level of percentage fruit set throughout the study for
   both sites. In contrast, pollen deposition onto stigmas exhibited
   considerable site and year heterogeneity in its effect on seed
   production per fruit. In the cumulative test of pollen limitation,
   however, we detected no difference between total annual seed production
   between our open-pollinated control and hand-pollinated experimental
   plants in the woodland site during the 4-yr study. A weak negative trend
   was detected between fruit set per plant and average seed set per fruit
   among all plants in the woodland site, suggesting a limited role for an
   intraplant compensation mechanism. No significant trade-off was detected
   in probability of survival and flowering between the control and
   hand-pollinated experimental treatment groups at either site. In
   addition, no cost was detected in future growth and reproduction in the
   woodland population, Similar total seed production among individuals in
   the two treatment groups explains in part, why no difference was
   observed in future survival, growth, and reproduction between the
   control and hand-pollinated treatment groups.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural practices may cause contamination of soil and ground water
   with a combination of organic compounds (pesticides and fuel) and
   nitrogen fertilizers. In coupled microcosm studies that monitored the
   mineralization of naphthalene and the nitrification of ammonia, it was
   observed that the solvent (dichloromethane) used to apply naphthalene to
   the soil inhibited nitrification, although there was no effect on
   naphthalene mineralization. Further studies were performed with a series
   of application solvents: methanol, acetonitrile, trichloromethane, and
   dichloromethane. Soil and solvent were allowed to equilibrate with
   ambient air for various times before capping and incubation of
   microcosms. Results indicated that dichloromethane equilibrated for 5
   mins inhibited nitrification for at least 3 weeks relative to the
   control (water). Acetonitrile and trichloromethane similarly inhibited
   nitrification. Methanol and dichloromethane equilibrated for 60 mins
   also significantly delayed nitrification, although to a lesser extent.
   Inhibition of nitrification was not permanent, and nitrification
   activity was eventually restored in all systems tested. None of the
   solvents inhibited mineralization of the added carbon source. These
   results indicate that special care must be taken to ensure that
   applications solvents do not affect the activity of sensitive microbial
   populations, such as the nitrifiers, that may be part of a study.}},

Abstract = {{Ribbed mussel populations at two levels of the intertidal shore were
   studied for 3 yr at a salt marsh site in Jamaica Bay (New York).
   Length-specific dry body weight was determined monthly and shell growth
   was monitored between April and November of each year. Production (P-t)
   was measured as monthly changes in body dry weight. Annual reproductive
   output (P-t) was estimated Indirectly for mussels between 10 mm and 80
   mm by determining the gain in body weight prior to spawning (Weight
   Gained Method). Using a second method (Basal Weight Method), monthly
   rates of somatic production (P-g) were determined by assuming that, as
   mussels grow in length, a fraction of monthly P-t is allocated to
   increasing body weight. The monthly production allocated to growth (P-g)
   was estimated based on the length-specific body weight (basal weight) in
   March, when body weights in these populations begin to increase due to
   gametogenesis. Monthly rates of reproductive output (P-r) were then
   estimated be substraction as the difference between monthly P-t and P-g.
   Total P-R determined by both methods were very similar. Shell and body
   growth were concurrent in sexually immature mussels, but body weight
   preceeded shell growth in older, larger animals. Annual shell increments
   were correlated with annual P-G. In sexually mature mussels, P-r
   preceeds P-g in larger mussels, that is, allocations of net production
   to reproduction and somatic growth diverge in time with increasing shell
   length, Between April and November, shell growth rates were correlated
   with water temperature. At the higher shore level, mussels allocated a
   much smaller proportion of total production to growth, exceeding the
   reproductive effort of the lower-shore population. Variation in mussel
   production between years probably is related to variability in
   nannoplankton biomass. Although mussels higher on the shore can reduce
   somatic growth in order to increase fecundity and reproductive effort,
   total reproductive output is much reduced as compared to the marsh edge.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in early life stages of species that are permanent residents
   of the estuarine nekton is poorly understood, especially in systems with
   extensive areas of emergent vegetation (e.g., salt marshes and
   mangroves). Sampling small mobile nekton in these shallow intertidal
   habitats presents a difficult methodological challenge. Simulated
   aquatic microhabitats (SAMs) were used to collect the early life stages
   of resident nekton that remained on the emergent marsh surface after it
   was exposed by the tide and could not be adequately sampled by
   traditional methods. Where the intertidal is a prominent areal component
   of the estuary, a large portion of young nekton could be overlooked
   using other common survey methods (e.g., plankton tows or block nets),
   Populations of young fishes and natant crustaceans were monitored for a
   year at 3-d to 6-d intervals from both low and high intertidal
   elevations within each of two marsh sites on Sapelo Island, Georgia,
   USA. Three species accounted for >99\% of the 41,023 individuals
   collected. These were the killifishes heteroclitus (57.0\%) and F.
   luciae (4.0\%), and the daggerblade grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio
   (38.4\%). Young F. heteroclitus were used in field enclosure experiments
   to relate abundance data to actual areal densities. Average annual
   estimated density of young nekton on the surface of the intertidal marsh
   at low tide was 7.2 individuals m(-2). Early life stages of estuarine
   resident species, particularly those with demersal young, are not
   affected by the same physical processes influencing larval supply and
   recruitment variability in marine-spawned species. In salt marshes,
   biotic factors (e.g., adult reproductive activity, predation, and food
   limitation) may be more important as proximate causes of variation
   during the early life histories of resident nekton.}},

Abstract = {{The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus is not observed to
   maintain populations in supralittoral pools containing the alga
   Cladophora trichotoma. Laboratory microcosms and field treatments in
   Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada were inoculated with T.
   californicus and monitored seasonally (winter, spring, summer). After 5
   days, C. trichotoma microcosms held fewer survivors (18.6 +/- 7.3\%)
   compared to treatments without vegetation (95.6 +/- 0.1\%) or those
   containing the alga Enteromorpha compressa (93.8 +/- 5.4\%), mean +/-
   SE. Though more difficult to determine in situ, results from inoculated
   field sites were similar. Copepodite and adult T. californicus were the
   most adversely affected, while the survival of nauplii was generally
   maintained over 5-day intervals of observation. Other invertebrates,
   including littorines, barnacles and mussels were more abundant in C.
   trichotoma pools at lower tidal elevations. Although several factors
   (exposure, nutrient supply, predation) are likely to contribute to the
   observed `exclusion' of T. californicus from pools containing C.
   trichotoma, the present results additionally suggest the deleterious
   influence of an unidentified chemical exudate from C. trichotoma. The
   particular susceptibility of mature T. californicus to this exudate
   precludes the establishment of viable copepod populations in these
   pools. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.}},

Abstract = {{Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) is a phytoseiid mite which is
   commercially available as a biological control agent of spider mites.
   Genetic manipulation of this phytoseiid species has yielded transgenic
   strains. but none have been released into the environment. Previous data
   suggested that M. occidentalis could not survive the wet, humid summers
   in Florida. A non-transgenic strain of M. occidentalis was released into
   field plots in Gainesville on soybean plants infested with the
   two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Populations were
   monitored from April-October 1994, and weather data were gathered at the
   release site. Permethrin-treated barrier rows were monitored to
   determine if the mites dispersed outside the plots, and aerial dispersal
   was monitored with sticky traps. Predator and spider-mite populations
   repeatedly crashed during the summer months, and population growth was
   negatively correlated with rainfall. CLIMEX, a population growth model
   which uses climatic factors to determine whether a given poikilothermic
   species can colonize and persist in new geographic areas, also indicated
   that M. occidentalis cannot persist through the wet season in Florida,
   although it may be able to establish and persist through the fall,
   winter and spring months.}},

Abstract = {{1. Relationships between distributions of animals and the resources they
   use can be expected to depend critically on the mobility of individual
   animals within populations. However, there is little information on the
   movements of individuals within populations of animals in most natural
   aquatic systems, so it is difficult to model accurately the processes
   that underlie their distributions.
   2. Aspects of the processes involved in the colonization of vacant areas
   by stream-resident Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (69-114 mm length) were
   measured under near-natural conditions. In five separate trials over
   summer months, groups of salmon were introduced into enclosed 30-m long
   sections of stream, each comprising three distinct 10-m long regions of
   habitat. The subsequent movements of each individual fish within the
   enclosures were monitored remotely and continuously using a passive
   integrated transponder (PIT) tracking system.
   3. Considerable variation was observed between the activity of different
   individual salmon. Some of the fish (range between trials, 3-33\%)
   settled into localized home ranges without moving between regions,
   10-38\% of the fish moved within two regions, and 37-87\% of the salmon
   moved through all three regions of their enclosure. A fraction (0-20\%)
   of some of the populations was particularly mobile and never settled but
   continued to move throughout all three regions of the enclosure. Within
   the scale of this current study, it would appear that, for territorial
   animals such as salmon parr, certain members of the population will
   settle in new territories after very little exploration of their new
   environment.
   4. The propensity to explore was independent of habitat type, but was
   directly proportional to the size of the fish.
   5. The time from release until 50\% of fish in populations settled
   (excluding the mobile fraction) ranged from 0.3 to 2.4 days. Activity
   levels were particularly high and initial movements by fish were
   directed upstream in trial 1, early in the summer, perhaps reflecting
   upstream migration by salmon parr within the population of the burn at
   this time.}},

Title = {{Interactive effects of sublethal nematodes and nutritional status on
   snowshoe hare vulnerability to predation}},

Abstract = {{1. We studied the effect of parasitism on snowshoe hare (Lepus
   americanus) survival through a field experiment that reduced natural
   burdens of sublethal nematodes in a free-ranging hare population. We
   treated half the hares on each of six study areas year-round with an
   anthelminthic drug, and the other half with a placebo. Potential
   interactive effects of parasitism and nutrition were examined by
   supplementing the natural food supply on three of the six study areas
   during two winters. Survival was measured by radio-collaring a total of
   612 hares with mortality-sensitive transmitters and monitoring survival
   daily between April 1991 and June 1993.
   2. Overall, nematode burdens in hares were highest between March and
   October, and Obeliscoides cuniculi was the most abundant of the five
   species present. The proximate cause of 95\% of mortalities (n = 318)
   during the study was predation. Predators killed hares with heavy
   burdens of O. cuniculi disporportionately during May-June, but burdens
   of the four other species (Nematodirus triangularis, Trichuris leporis,
   Dirofilaria scapiceps, Protostrongylus boughtoni) were similar between
   predator-killed hares and the live population.
   3. During May-October 1991, the anthelminthic treatment did not affect
   hare survival, but during May-October 1992 survival of parasite-reduced
   hares was 2.4-times higher than that of controls. During November
   1991-April 1992 survival of food supplemented hares was 21\% higher than
   food-normal animals, but survival was similar during November 1992-April
   1993.
   4. The effect of parasite-reduction on hare survival was apparently
   contingent on overwinter food supplies between November 1991 and April
   1992, with survival being highest in hares subjected to both treatments,
   intermediate in those receiving only food supplementation, and lowest in
   unfed hares. We conclude that the effect of sublethal nematode
   parasitism on hare survival can be important if interactive with
   predation, and that synergistic effects of parasitism and nutrition may
   affect hares if food availability is limited.}},

Abstract = {{During the incubation stage of breeding, male House Wrens periodically
   move very near nest cavities and sing, and females, who alone incubate
   in this species, often appear to wait to take a break from incubating
   until they hear their mate singing nearby. This study tested
   quantitatively for a non-random association between female nest
   attentiveness and male song output in two ways. First, 11 pairs of wrens
   were observed for 2 h during their incubation stages and the rime of
   each male song and each female exit from, and entrance into, the nest
   cavity was noted. Of the 60 exits observed, 29 (48\%) occurred within 30
   s of when the male began a song bout near the nest. Overall, female
   exits followed significantly sooner after the start of male song bouts
   than expected if exits normally occurred al random with respect to song.
   Males were also removed temporarily from 12 territories during
   incubation stages and the nest attentiveness of their females was
   monitored for 2 h. These experimental females spent, on average, 18\%
   more time in nests than did 11 undisturbed control females (47 vs 40
   min/h). This occurred only because experimental females waited longer to
   exit nests during each attentive period. Experimental females did not
   take shorter recesses. Females may benefit from waiting to exit nests
   until their mates are singing nearby because: (1) the male's song
   indicates to the female that no predators are present, (2) males will be
   present to guard nests, especially against conspecifics, in the female's
   absence, and/or (3) males can act as sentinels while females are
   foraging.}},

Abstract = {{The movement of Ambystoma cingulatum was monitored at a 0.8 ha breeding
   site in Okaloosa County, Florida with a drift fence and funnel traps for
   two consecutive breeding seasons (1993-1995). In 1993-1994, 198
   salamanders were captured, 76\% in the months of October and November;
   yearlings comprised 66\% of the catch. A total of 59 salamanders was
   captured in 1994-1995, only 10\% of which were yearlings. Differences in
   number of yearlings captured between years may be the result of annual
   variation in either the amount and distribution of rainfall or
   recruitment of juveniles in previous years. Salamander movement was
   positively correlated with precipitation and minimum air temperature.
   The sex ratio was female-biased in 1993-1994, but no different than
   parity in 1994-1995. In 1993-1994, salamanders that entered and exited
   the breeding site only once remained in the basin for an average of 38
   days, and exited within an average of 44 m from the point of entry. More
   salamanders immigrated from mesic longleaf/slash pine flatwoods than
   from xeric longleaf/sand pine flatwoods.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable use of tropical forest systems requires continuous
   monitoring of biological diversity and ecosystem functions. This can be
   efficiently done with `early warning' (short-cycle) indicator groups of
   non-economical insects, whose population levels and resources are
   readily measured. Twenty-one groups of insects are evaluated as focal
   indicator taxa for rapid assessment of changes in Neotropical forest
   systems. Composite environmental indices for heterogeneity, richness,
   and natural disturbance are correlated positively with butterfly
   diversity in 56 Neotropical sites studied over many years. Various
   components of alpha, beta and gamma-diversity show typical responses to
   increased disturbance and different land-use regimes. Diversity often
   increases with disturbance near or below natural levels, but some
   sensitive species and genes are eliminated at very low levels of
   interference. Agricultural and silvicultural mosaics with over 30\%
   conversion, including selective logging of three or more large trees per
   hectare, show shifts in species composition with irreversible loss of
   many components of the butterfly community, indicating non-sustainable
   land and resource use and reduction of future options. Monitoring of
   several insect indicator groups by local residents in a species-rich
   Brazilian Amazon extractive reserve has helped suggest guidelines for
   ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable zoning and use
   regimes.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted from 1991 to 1992 to examine induction
   and impact of hematopoietic neoplasia on the marine bivalve Mya arenaria
   in southeastern Massachusetts. Clams were collected from Little
   Buttermilk Bay and separated into three size classes (20-29, 30-39, and
   40-49 mm shell length) in the laboratory. These sizes span the range of
   adults found in the population. A random subsample of these clams was
   taken to estimate disease prevalence at the start of the experiment, and
   this was found to be less than or equal to 10\% in all size classes.
   Remaining clams were assigned randomly to two groups: Control and
   Treated. `'Controls'' were injected with filtered seawater, while
   `'Treated'' clams were injected with hemocytes extracted from diseased
   individuals. Injection of diseased hemocytes was performed to increase
   disease prevalence in the Treated group. Clams were returned to New
   Bedford Harbor, a more contaminated field location, where hematopoietic
   neoplasia is more prevalent, in January 1991, and characteristics of
   both groups were monitored for 555 days. Among Controls, probability of
   survival was size-dependent, with higher survival rates in larger clams.
   Treated clams had a lower probability of survival than Controls, and the
   magnitude of treatment effect increased with size class. The impact on
   survival was evident after 89 days, but it was first shown to be
   statistically significant after 189 days. Among Controls, probability of
   disease was strongly season-dependent, increasing in the large size
   class from 0.19 in spring to 0.50 in summer. During summer, Treated
   clams had a higher probability of being diseased than Controls. Among
   survivors, no significant sublethal effects due to treatment were
   detected in the field experiment. Experimental manipulation of disease
   prevalence may be a useful tool in future studies. In addition to
   results pertaining to disease, this study obtained long-term growth
   information, by size class, on somatic and reproductive tissue and shell
   size. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of habitat and microclimate on survival of unfed nymphal
   black-legged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say (=I. damnini Spielman,
   Clifford, Piesman \& Corwin), were studied under natural conditions in
   southcentral and northwestern Connecticut. At both coastal and inland
   locations, survival of 3 groups of 20 wild-caught questing nymphs placed
   in nylon mesh bags was monitored in each of 3 different habitats (field,
   forest canopy, and forest/field edge) during summer 1995.
   Simultaneously, soil temperature, ground-level air temperature, and
   relative humidity were measured continuously within each habitat at both
   sites. The number of ticks surviving in each habitat was monitored
   weekly. Average daily survival rates of nymphs were relate inversely to
   soil temperature but were not related to air temperature or humidity.
   Overall, nymphal ticks at the inland site survived significantly longer
   than those at the coastal site; however, no significant differences in
   mortality rates were found among habitats. These results suggest that
   inland environmental conditions are suitable for lengthy survival of
   unfed nymphal I. scapularis in regions where this tick is not yet
   abundant.}},

Abstract = {{Cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche), were reared at different
   temperatures to examine further the effects on egg-to-adult development
   and emergence of adults from cocoons. Three different temperatures
   (26.7, 21.1, and 15.5 degrees C) were used to rear fleas. Emergence of
   adults from cocoons was monitored using 2 experimental designs-cocoons
   maintained in groups and cocoons individually isolated. At cooler
   temperatures, cocoons kept in groups had a higher incidence of
   late-emerging adults than did individual cocoons. At 15.5 degrees C,
   adults continued to emerge from grouped cocoons up to 80 d after all had
   emerged from individual cocoons. Developmental time of prepupae and
   pupae was determined by inhibiting cocoon formation of late 3rd instars.
   Male prepupae and pupae developed approximate to 20\% slower than did
   females. Comparisons between emergence of adults from cocoons and from
   naked pupae indicate that a large percentage of adults emerge from
   cocoons soon after molting. The possible association of developmental
   temperatures and emergence from cocoons with overwintering populations
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Sporophytes of the arctic kelp Laminaria solidungula were collected from
   the Beaufort Sea and kept for 7 months at 0 +/- 1.5 degrees C in a
   factorial experiment under two light (continuous darkness or 25 mu mol
   photons m(-2) s(-1) on a 12: 12 L/D cycle) and two nutrient regimes
   (with or without added nitrate). We monitored growth rate and at the end
   of the experiment measured the following on both new and old blades:
   carbon and nitrogen content, chlorophyll and carotenoids, photosynthetic
   light-response (P vs. I curves, and photosynthetic unit size
   (Chl/P-700). New blade initiation was independent of light and external
   nitrate, but blades grew minimally in darkness. Both new (B1) and old
   (B2) blades of plants held in darkness (with or without added nitrate)
   had the same quantum yield (phi(m)) and area-normalized photosynthetic
   capacity (P-m), but a slightly lower respiration rate (R-d) and
   compensation irradiance (I-c less than or equal to 1.5 mu mol photons
   m(-2) s(-1)) as B2 of plants grown in the light with added nitrate.
   Nitrogen starvation in the light, but not in darkness, caused reduced
   pigments, P-m, and phi(m) and increased I-c. Tissue C and N were
   primarily affected by light, whereas pigments were more strongly
   affected by N and light x N interaction. Based on these results,
   previous results for held-collected plants, and continuous in situ light
   data, we conclude that total annual growth in this population is
   severely light-limited, with N having an important but secondary role.}},

   Pseudomonas putida strains in the open environment. The strain El was
   used for four years for the biodegradation of phenolic compounds in
   industrial wastewater in Polva, Estonia. In this study we used the
   strain E2 which is a non-carbenicillin-resistant variant of the strain
   E1. Both strains have a deletion of approximately 34 kb in the TOL
   plasmid pWWO which served as a basis for discrimination from indigenous
   bacteria by molecular analyses. Other targets used for PCR and DNA
   hybridization were the xylE gent and a sequence located in the
   left-handed region of to the transposon Tn4652. In laboratory tests we
   demonstrated that two cells inoculated into 20 ml of river water could
   be detected against a background of mere than 10(7) colony forming units
   (CFUs) by a combination of growth on selective media and molecular
   analysis. Using the same combination of methods in a deliberate release
   experiment, detection of the released strain was possible only to 32 h
   after release. It is assumed that the released strains did not survive
   in the aquatic ecosystem, mainly due to the high dilution rate. The
   combination of cultivation on selective media and molecular analyses
   proved useful for tracking Pseudomonas putida strain E2 in an aquatic
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Recent emphasis on residue management in sustainable agriculture
   highlights the importance of elucidating the mechanisms of microbial
   degradation of cellulose. Cellulose decomposition and its associated
   microbial dynamics in soil were investigated in incubation experiments.
   Population dynamics of actinomycetes, bacteria, and fungi were monitored
   by direct counts. Populations of oligotrophic bacteria in
   cellulose-amended soil were determined by plate count using a low C
   medium containing 4 mg C liter(-1) agar, and copiotrophs using a high C
   medium. Cumulative (CO2)-C-14 evolution from C-14-labeled cellulose was
   best described by a multiphasic curve in a 28-day incubation experiment.
   The initial phase of decomposition was attributed mainly to the activity
   of bacterial populations with a low oligotroph-to-copiotroph ratio, and
   the second phase mainly to fungal populations. An increase in
   oligotroph-to-copiotroph ratio coincided with the emergence of a rapid
   (CO2)-C-14 evolution stage. Streptomycin reduced (CO2)-C-14 evolution
   during the first phase and prompted earlier emergence of the second
   phase, compared to the control. Cycloheximide initially promoted
   (CO2)-C-14 evolution but subsequently had a lasting negative effect on
   (CO2)-C-14 evolution. Cycloheximide addition significantly increased
   bacterial biomass and resulted in substantially stronger oscillation of
   active bacterial populations, whereas it initially reduced, and then
   stimulated, active fungal biomass. The observed changes in (CO2)-C-14
   evolution could not be explained by observed shifts in fungal and
   bacterial biomass, probably because functional groups of fungi and
   bacteria could not be distinguished. However, it was suggested that
   oligotrophic bacteria prompted activation of cellulolytic enzumes in
   fungi and played an important role in leading to fungal dominance of
   cellulose decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{RAPD-PCR was used to determine the genetic variation of Metopolophium
   dirhodum collected in a winter wheat field and in a nearby 2.5-m-high
   suction trap at Lincoln, New Zealand. Over three collection dates, five
   distinct genotypes were identified, using two primers (OPK16 and OPC09)
   independently. There was a significant temporal effect on the ratio of
   genotypes in populations collected in the field. There was no
   significant spatial aggregation or association of these genotypes in the
   field. Two of the genotypes present in the field were also detected in
   the suction trap sample. Using a higher resolution method of RAPD-PCR
   (with the Stoffel fragment of Tag polymerase), a total of 124 genotypes
   were distinguished from 142 individuals collected from Scotland and New
   Zealand. The Jaccard similarity index (S) was used to measure similarity
   between individual aphids within and between populations from both
   hemispheres. All populations were very diverse (S < 0.33). However, at
   similar crop growth stages, M. dirhodum was significantly more diverse
   in Scotland than in New Zealand. The results are discussed in relation
   to the value of monitoring aphid flights for pest forecasting, and in
   terms of the most appropriate RAPD-PCR techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of natural mortality (M) of Haliotis iris were estimated by
   monitoring enclosed populations, and from the frequency of empty marked
   shells recovered from natural populations. Annual instantaneous rates
   were less than or equal to 0.1 in all instances. The major source of
   mortality was predation by the starfish Astrostole scabra. Predation by
   fishes was evidently low. The low rates of natural mortality suggest
   that fisheries for H. iris may be less productive than those of other
   species of abalone.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the putative effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) of 1991-92 in a semi-arid locality of northern Chile. We obtained
   30 months of pre ENSO data, followed by 36 months of peak and post ENSO
   data (total = 5.5 yr). The rainy winter of 1991 resulted in a three-fold
   increase in total seed bank (perennial and ephemerals pooled) and in
   ephemeral (but not perennial) herb cover. Seed and herbage eaters
   (rodents) irrupted to population levels ca 20 times higher during the
   breeding season of 1991 than the preceding wintering season. Diurnal
   carnivorous predators (hawks, owls, and foxes) showed a delayed response
   to the irruption, increasing from seven individuals sighted during the
   wintering season of 1991 to 13 during the wintering season of 1992. A
   seemingly counterclockwise trajectory of predator abundance versus prey
   levels suggested a pattern of prey-driven dynamics, but confidence
   intervals were likely broad. In this semiarid locality, it appears that
   ENSO effects did not cascade down from higher to lower trophic levels,
   but rather the opposite. In this bottom-up scenario, we predict that as
   primary productivity varies with rainfall, so should secondary (mammal
   prey densities), and tertiary productivity (vertebrate predators).
   Long-term monitoring of this terrestrial ecosystem is needed to test
   this prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys for the Madagascar Fish Eagle Haliaeetus vociferoides were
   conducted each breeding season (May through October) from 1991 through
   1995 between Morondava and Antsiranana, western to northwestern
   Madagascar, to estimate the population size of this endangered species.
   Suitable habitat including lakes, rivers, estuaries, mangroves, and
   marine islands was searched and at least 222 adult Madagascar Fish
   Eagles were observed including 63 breeding pairs, 36 probable pairs, 24
   single adults and 18 immature birds. Assuming that all probable pairs
   were breeding, we estimated the Madagascar Fish Eagle breeding
   population was 99 pairs (95\% confidence interval = 78 to 120) in the
   area searched. This estimate is about twice the number previously
   estimated in the period 1980-1985, due mainly, we believe, to our
   greater search effort, although we cannot discount an increase in the
   breeding population. The number of breeding pairs has declined since
   1985 in some localities, suggesting a population decline or movement of
   pairs away from these sites. We recommend annual monitoring of a random
   sample of known breeding pairs until causes for the species' rarity have
   been limited and no evidence of population decline is detected, followed
   by monitoring at least every five years until the species can be removed
   from the endangered list.}},

   imidacloprid due to strong antifeeding responses}},
Journal = {{PESTICIDE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A French strain of the tobacco aphid Myzus nicotianae Blackman
   (Hamoptera: Aphididae), strain FR, showed high tolerance to imidacloprid
   in short-term (48-h) oral ingestion bioassays when compared to a
   susceptible reference strain of Myzus persicae, strain NS, The resulting
   tolerance factors were > 50. Measures of the contact activity of
   imidacloprid by the FAO dip method failed to detect these high factors
   of tolerance. The tolerance factor was in general < 10 when using the
   dip method. The resulting difference between tolerance factors could be
   attributed to a behavioural component to fitness between strain FR and
   strain NS as further experiments revealed, When measuring the effect of
   systemically applied imidacloprid on honeydew excretion, a 50\%
   reduction occurred in both strain FR and strain NS at nearly the same
   concentration of imidacloprid providing evidence for a similar
   antifeedant response in bath strains. Starvation experiments revealed
   that the French strain was able to survive approximately 24 h longer
   than a reference laboratory strain of M. persicae. This result coincided
   with the fact that systemically applied imidacloprid showed the same
   aphicidal potential against strain FR after three days as against strain
   NS after two days, i.e. 24 h later. After rearing in the laboratory for
   six months the French strain of M. nicotianae lost its hardiness and
   also its apparent ability to tolerate imidacloprid. However, strain FR
   was a heterogeneous field strain and it if possible that a susceptible
   variant out-reproduced a more hardy variant.
   These findings indicate that the type of bioassay is very important when
   assessing aphid populations for resistance against the chloronicotinyl
   insecticide imidacloprid, because of its distinct mode of action. It is
   obvious that an aphid dip test, i.e. FAO dip test, produces more
   reliable results than the different kinds of short-term oral ingestion
   bioassays, because of the reversible behavioural changes induced by
   imidacloprid after oral uptake. Thus a short-term oral ingestion
   bioassay (less than or equal to 48 h) is not recommended for precise
   detection of possible resistance of Myzus SP, to imidacloprid, although
   this mode of uptake for imidacloprid might be sometimes more realistic
   in terms of field behaviour, The ideal test to generate most accurate
   data would be a slightly longer (72-h) feeding bioassay, perhaps used in
   conjunction with a dip test. The possible influence of the results on
   resistance monitoring is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Light harvesting and utilization by chloroplasts located near the
   adaxial vs the abaxial surface of sun and shade leaves were examined by
   fluorometry in two herbaceous perennials that differed in their anatomy
   and leaf inclination. Leaves of Thermopsis montana had well-developed
   palisade and spongy mesophyll whereas the photosynthetic tissue of
   Smilacina stellata consisted of spongy mesophyll only. Leaf orientation
   depended upon the irradiance during leaf development. When grown under
   low-light levels, leaves of S. stellata and T. montana were nearly
   horizontal, whereas under high-light levels, S. stellata leaves and T.
   montana leaves were inclined 60 degrees and 30 degrees, respectively.
   Leaf inclination increased the amount of light that was intercepted by
   the lower leaf surfaces and affected the photosynthetic properties of
   the chloroplasts located near the abaxial leaf surface. The slowest
   rates of quinone pool reduction and reoxidation were found in
   chloroplasts located near the adaxial leaf surface of ?: montana plants
   grown under high light, indicating large quinone pools in these
   chloroplasts. Chloroplasts near the abaxial surface of low-light leaves
   had lower light utilization capacities as shown by photochemical
   quenching measurements. The amount of photosystem II (PSII) down
   regulation, measured from each leaf surface, was also found to be
   influenced by irradiance and leaf inclination. The greatest difference
   between down regulation monitored from the adaxial vs abaxial surfaces
   was found in plants with horizontal leaves. Different energy dissipation
   mechanisms may be employed by the two species. Values for down
   regulation in S. stellata were 2-3 times higher than those in T.
   montana, while the portion of the PSII population which was found to be
   Q(B) nonreducing was 4-6 times lower in high light S. stellata leaves
   than in T. montana. All values of Stern-Volmer type nonphotochemical
   quenching (NPQ) from S. stellata leaves were similar when quenching
   analysis was performed at actinic irradiances that were higher than the
   irradiance to which the leaf surface was exposed during growth. In
   contrast, with T. montana, NPQ values from the abaxial leaf surface were
   up to 45\% higher than those from the adaxial leaf surface regardless of
   growth conditions. The observed differences in chloroplast properties
   between species and between the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces may
   depend upon a complex interaction among light, leaf anatomy and leaf
   inclination.}},

Abstract = {{Few phytoplankton investigations have been carried out at the end of the
   growth season, particularly in the Arctic. In the present study, we
   monitored the phytoplankton distribution in relation to environmental
   conditions in the Barents Sea in September 1988 and October 1987. An
   ice-edge bloom was found in September at 80 degrees N in a stratified
   meltwater layer, lasting until new ice formation and southward advection
   of the ice cover commenced in the middle of the month. Phytoplankton
   populations in the marginal ice zone at this time were not nutrient
   limited, but biomass was probably reduced due to grazing by small
   copepods. Lower chl/C and chl/N ratios in the phytoplankton above the
   pycnocline than below in September indicated light-adapted populations.
   In October the particulate matter was rich in carbon, but had low
   chlorophyll content, indicating high levels of detritus. The
   hydrographic conditions in October differed greatly fi-om those observed
   in September. The combination of freezing and mixing resulted in higher
   salinity and nutrient concentrations, and caused a homogeneous
   distribution, as well as reduction, of the phytoplankton stocks in the
   upper water column. During late October, low incoming radiation,
   combined with deep vertical mixing, resulted in light-limiting
   conditions for the algae, eventually stopping photosynthesis and
   terminating the growth season in the northern Barents Sea.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of social structures and reproductive behaviours leading
   to actual spawning in the Mediterranean dusky grouper Epinephelus
   marginatus, was studied in the Medes Islands Marine Reserve on the
   Spanish coast (NW Mediterranean) from February 1995 to October 1996.
   Density, size, sex, colour patterns, relation the bottom, swimming
   activity and site occupation were monitored by visual census surveys at
   monthly and daily scales. The main observed socio-behavioural trends
   were in part comparable with some patterns reported in tropical
   groupers, although differences exist, which might in part be related to
   the temperate conditions of the northern Mediterranean sea. The density
   of dusky groupers in the area was low in winter, and maximal in summer;
   from late June to late August (up to 8-fold increase); numbers rised in
   spring? before the beginning of reproductive activities which led to
   spawning by mid August, and dropped rapidly afterwards. During this long
   reproductive period (about 2 months), dominant males (recognized by
   their highly specific colour pattern) established territories in which
   they displayed aggressively towards neighbouring males and numerous
   smaller females (the species is proterogynous); the observed sex-ratio
   was approximately 1:7 (sexually active males versus adult females).
   Territoriality of males is the base of the social structuration of the
   reproductive population; in addition, behaviours typical of the
   pre-spawning period include repeated evening gathering of females in
   open water, and the appearance of specific colours patterns. This
   overall socio-behavioural pattern changed in the evenings when spawning
   was observed (16th-21st of August), the males patrolling a reduced
   territory in which females would come to mate; spawning behaviour itself
   was described in Zabala er nl. (1997). The complex socio-behavioural
   structure leading to reproduction in the Dusky Grouper should be
   considered in fishery management, since it could hardly develop under
   strong human pressure. In this respect, the contribution of Marine
   protected areas is determinant for the reproductive success of this
   species in the NW Mediterranean basin.}},

Abstract = {{This paper consolidates all known information on the status of the Ozark
   big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) in Oklahoma since 1957
   when the species was first found in the state (Class, 1961). Currently,
   maternity colonies and hibernacula of C. t. ingens are only known to
   occur in Adair County, although individuals occasionally have been found
   in Cherokee and Delaware counties. Estimates of summer populations have
   been made annually at all known maternity sites since 1983. Summer
   estimates of big-eared bats ranged from a low of 215 in 1983 to a high
   of 852 in 1990. The median summer estimate for 1983 through 1986 was 289
   (range is 215 to 441). Increased numbers at all maternity caves, as well
   as discovery of a new maternity cave, brought the median summer estimate
   for 1987 through 1990 up to 776 (range is 581 to 852); however, numbers
   declined from 1991 through 1995 with a median of 527 (range is 381 to
   654). A hibernaculum was found in 1981 and has been monitored annually
   since 1986; winter estimates at that cave remained fairly stable from
   1986 through 1994 with a median of 242 (range is 182 to 323). Two
   additional hibernacula exist; one was used by a small number of bats
   some winters, and the other contained 247 big-eared bars when it was
   discovered in 1987. However, annual winter estimates could nor be made
   at these sites without considerable disturbance to both bats and caves.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of winter mortality is lacking for many avian populations, but
   its importance is widely recognized. We estimated winter mortality in a
   northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) population on the Fort Riley
   Military Reservation in northeastern Kansas by locating, flushing, and
   counting individual northern bob whites in coveys each month from
   December through March during 1961-1967 and 1968-1980. Number and
   duration of days of less than or equal to-5 degrees C and days with snow
   cover were obtained for each winter. Of the 403 coveys monitored, 198
   had access to food plots (<600 m) and 205 did not (>900 m from food
   plots). December-to-March mortality of northern bobwhites near food
   plots ranged from 24\% to 46\% ((X) over bar = 34\%), whereas mortality
   for those far from food plots was 20\% to 82\% ((X) over bar = 50\%).
   Number of days with snow cover of greater than or equal to 10 cm and
   duration of less than or equal to-5 degrees C temperatures during
   January were significantly correlated with mortality and were the best
   predictors of winter mortality of northern bobwhites.}},

Abstract = {{Evening primrose, Oenothera elata, is generally considered a
   hawkmoth-pollinated plant species that exhibits several characteristics
   of a moth pollination syndrome. We re-examined its reproductive biology
   by testing the hypothesis that a twilight-foraging carpenter bee,
   Xylocopa tabaniformis orpifex, can serve as its pollinator. In our study
   population, pollen was deposited by carpenter bees on 56\% of all the
   flower stigmas that were monitored during evening periods and at least
   70\% of those monitored during successive evening and morning periods;
   flowers that only carpenter bees were allowed to visit produced healthy
   seed pods about 3 weeks later. Given the effectiveness of X.
   tabaniformis as a pollinator and its overlap in range with Oenothera
   elata, we believe a mixed pollination syndrome that includes both bees
   and moths is a more appropriate characterization of the pollination
   biology of this plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction of herbivory by wintering lesser snow geese (Anser
   caerulescens caerulescens), environmental conditions, and burning were
   investigated in a mid-Texas coastal marsh dominated by Scirpus
   americanus (Olney bulrush). Goose grubbing and use of S. americanus
   rhizomes and roots initially produced a patchwork of denuded and
   vegetated areas on a recently burned area. Regrowth occurred by
   reestablishment of uprooted shoot complexes; regeneration from seed was
   not observed. Regrowth was dependent on intensity of use and
   post-herbivory environmental conditions. After three years of varying
   levels of goose use and environmental conditions, lowest foliar cover
   and standing crop occurred in areas with a high frequency and intensity
   of goose use followed by spring drought and high salinities. Greatest
   growth was associated with low frequency and intensity of use followed
   by normal spring freshwater inflows and low salinities. Burning did not
   significantly affect the response of S. americanus. Continued frequent
   and intense snow goose use, coupled with high salinity and extended
   periods with water levels below the marsh surface, can produce denuded
   mudflats subject to accelerated soil erosion. Management strategies to
   reduce the impact of these combined events could be implemented.
   Hydroperiod and salinity conditions should be routinely monitored, and
   goose populations should be temporally and spatially directed to reduce
   the potential for conversion of marsh to permanent mudflats.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{194}},
Pages = {{15-37}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Variations in water quality and chemical loads are described for UK
   rivers draining to the North Sea. These variations are related to
   regional differences in geology, climate, land use and population
   distribution. The study uses water quality data collected under the
   Harmonised Monitoring Scheme. Regional maps of average concentrations
   and tables of loads, concentrations and loads per unit area are used to
   present the data.
   For all the examined determinands, industrial and domestic inputs cause
   significant increases in river concentrations. For some, such as nickel,
   ammonium, orthophosphate, lindane and dieldrin, industrial/domestic
   inputs dominate all other sources. For others, there are comparable
   inputs from diffuse sources from either mine contaminated sediments
   (e.g. zinc, lead and copper to the North) or from weathering of bedrock
   (e.g. calcium to the South, because of the dominance of limestones and
   calcareous clays). Even for determinands such as nitrate, which are
   widely recognised as having diffuse sources, industrial inputs can be
   very significant.
   For many substances around 60-80\% of the total riverine load to the
   North Sea (as measured at the tidal limits between the Tweed and the
   Yare) is derived from the Humber rivers, even though this region
   supplies only a half of the flow. The Aire and Don contribute
   particularly high loads relative to their catchment area. The much
   larger Trent, which provides about a fifth of the flow from the LOIS
   region, also carries substantial loads and it contrasts strongly with
   the Tweed which carries almost as much water, but only a fraction of the
   load. Northern rivers generally contribute low loads of most
   determinands, the exception being for metals such as iron, lead and
   zinc, which account for over a third of the total North Sea input from
   the UK. East Anglian rivers provide only 8\% of total flow and are
   generally a relatively minor source of materials. Most significant
   inputs from the East Anglian region are for calcium, nitrate, sulphate
   and orthophosphate. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Paris Commission (PARCOM) data have been used to investigate regional
   patterns in land-based pollutant loads to the southern North Sea for the
   period 1990-1993. Despite measures to standardise the procedures for
   obtaining river load estimates, important methodological discrepancies
   remain. These discrepancies relate to: (i) the location of sampling with
   respect to tidal and saline limits along the river reach, (ii) frequency
   of sampling, (iii) whether sampling is periodic or aperiodic and biased
   to particular flow conditions, and (iv) the choice between two load
   estimation algorithms. The PARCOM data indicate that riverine and total
   land-based loads of metals, total-N and total-P to the southern North
   Sea are dominated by the Rhine/Meuse and Elbe, which have the largest
   catchment areas and drain major centres of population and industry in
   central and western Europe. UK rivers have both the highest riverine
   loads per unit area and the highest direct discharge loads for many
   determinands. The high loads per unit area may be a function of the
   relatively small catchment areas and the proximity of major sources of
   pollution to the downstream monitoring sites. Higher direct discharges
   for the UK rivers may occur because UK direct discharge estimates
   include effluent inputs to the freshwater tidal reaches. For the other
   major European river systems, effluent discharges to the tidal
   freshwater reaches are included in the riverine load estimate. More
   thorough evaluation of load estimation methodologies is required if
   these data are to be used for comparative purposes in an international
   policy-making and legislative context. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Current biological monitoring techniques are often unable to provide
   accurate estimates of pesticide dose in exposed worker populations. This
   study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of pesticide
   biomonitoring using saliva. Atrazine
   {[}2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-(isopropylamino)-s-triazine], a member of the
   triazine herbicides, was selected to investigate salivary excretion
   following direct gastric administration in rats. Concentrations of
   atrazine in whole saliva and arterial plasma samples were determined by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Atrazine reached its highest
   level in both arterial plasma (238 mu g/L) and whole saliva (157 mu g/L)
   35 min after administration of 105 mg/kg of atrazine, and then decreased
   with time in a parallel fashion. Although saliva atrazine levels were
   lower than levels in arterial plasma, there was a very high correlation
   between whole saliva and arterial plasma atrazine concentrations (r(2)
   =.95). In addition, pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that salivary
   levels of atrazine can be used to predict concentrations of atrazine in
   plasma. The mean whole saliva/arterial plasma atrazine concentration
   ratio (S/P) was 0.66 +/- 0.11 (n = 20). The S/P ratios did not vary
   significantly over time, and were not affected by salivary flow rate.
   This study demonstrates that atrazine is transported into saliva, and
   that a relatively constant concentration ratio between whole saliva and
   arterial plasma is maintained. Because the salivary concentrations of
   atrazine are independent of variation in salivary flow rate, salivary
   monitoring of atrazine in humans may prove useful and practical.
   Finally, this study suggests that other pesticides with chemical and
   physical properties similar to those of atrazine can be monitored in
   saliva.}},

Abstract = {{The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), introduced from
   Australia about 150 years ago, has become a major pest threatening the
   native biota of New Zealand. It is also an important disease vector,
   acting as a wildlife reservoir of infection. Conventional methods of
   control have had little effect on reducing the national population, so
   there is a quest to find more effective and humane methods. This has led
   to an upsurge in research aimed at increasing our knowledge of the
   biology of this marsupial, with an attendant increase in requirements
   for access to colony-housed animals.
   Possums kept for research purposes have often been housed in individual
   cages, and several colonies have experienced high mortality rates.
   sifter capture, possums have shown inappetence, weight loss and a
   predisposition to infection, suggesting that this species is susceptible
   to post-capture stress. For our reproductive studies, research animals
   are only useful if maintained under conditions that ensure behavioural
   and physiological processes remain normal. We have adopted an `animal
   husbandry' approach for our possum colony, where social interaction and
   the ability to exhibit instinctive behaviour patterns are considered as
   important as adequate nutrition and housing.
   In this colony, group-housed possums show no signs of post-capture
   stress, and mortality rate has been less than one per cent (of > 600
   animals housed to date). Virtually all possums gain weight over the
   first month of captivity. Procedures for monitoring, handling and the
   collection of data from these animals, are carried out with little
   apparent stress to either animals or staff.}},

   watercourses on the property. A 10-month survey of burrows subsequently
   revealed that fewer than one-half of those studied were in permanent
   use. Moreover, daily burrow use in a typical burrow aggregation ranged
   from one-third to two-thirds of the total over a 45-day observation
   period. From regular observations made of 27 burrow aggregations
   consisting (at the end of the period) of 169 burrows, the data suggested
   that these may have accommodated 40 bilbies, that each added an extra
   burrow over 10 months, and that each used one, two or three burrows each
   night. Further research needs are identified from these introductory
   observations. These include monitoring the distribution and
   relationships between burrow and bilby numbers. Property management
   guidelines to minimize disturbance to areas of bilby activity, including
   by overgrazing by stock, have been recommended to, and adopted by, the
   landholders involved. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal variation of adult populations of Haematobin irritans
   Linnaeus was monitored at Santa Fe, Argentina from August 1992 to August
   1994 by weekly counts of flies on grazing heifers. Each year, flies were
   recorded at a density of more than two flies per heifer from
   August/September to the following June, with peaks of abundance in mid
   to late spring and late summer to mid autumn. The seasonal trend of fly
   numbers was best correlated with the mean temperature 4 weeks prior to
   each fly count (correlation indices of P<0.01 in six of the nine fly
   periods) followed by the previous 4 week mean saturation deficit.
   Rainfall and relative humidity correlated poorly with the seasonality of
   H. irritans. Temperature appeared crucial at the beginning (late winter)
   and at the end (early-mid autumn) of the fly season while its relevance
   diminished in the middle of the season. The percentage of heifers that
   were infested decreased from 80-100\% in the fly season to 0-55\%
   between fly seasons but H. irritans never disappeared from the herds,
   indicating that if diapause occurs at the latitude of the study area,
   part of the fly population was not sensitive to diapause inducing
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial ground nests were placed in medium-age or older forests
   adjoining (a) stands of regenerating forest (vegetation < 2 m high) were
   `hard' edges were created, and (b) stands of young forest (vegetation
   2-8 m high) where `soft' edges were created. Nests were placed at three
   distances from the forest edge (0 m, 50 m, and 100 m). Two Northern
   Bobwhite Quail (Colinus virginianus) eggs were placed in each nest and
   monitored after 7 and 14 days of exposure between late May and mid-July,
   1994. Overall nest predation was 72\% after 7 days and 85\% after 14
   days of exposure. Predation near soft edges was significantly higher
   than near hard edges after both 7 and 14 days of exposure. Predation
   near the edges: was significantly higher than away from the edges after
   both 7 and 14 days of exposure. Two motion-sensitive cameras were used
   Co record the identity of predator species. Cameras documented 28
   predation events Juring 1,728 hours of operation, caused by eight
   species of mammals. The predators included, in order of decreasing
   predation: fisher (Martes pennanti), Eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus),
   red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), red squirrel (Tamiasciurus
   hudsonicus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), black bear (Ursus
   americanus), gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), and striped skunk
   (Mephitis mephitis). Tile relationship between edges, predator
   assemblages, and nest success is complex, more studies at the landscape
   level are required to better understand the effects of these factors on

Abstract = {{To determine the factors that influence a female's decision of whether
   or not to re-lay, we removed first clutches from 17 marked female Tree
   Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in a nest-box population in eastern
   Ontario, Canada. Females and nests were then monitored to determine
   whether a replacement clutch was laid. Forty-one percent of females laid
   replacement clutches. First clutches of those females that laid
   replacement clutches were significantly larger than those elf females
   that did not relay. This suggests that female quality, indicated by
   having higher levels of expendable energy or greater foraging skill or
   efficiency, is the determining factor as to whether or not a replacement
   clutch will be laid. For birds that re-laid, the replacement clutch was
   significantly smaller than the first clutch. This suggests either a
   depletion of energy reserves with each subsequent nesting attempt, or an
   individual female's energetic tradeoffs to ensure her own survival to
   the next breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{We tested whether differences in the diets of nontarget organisms or in
   vegetation structure could result in adverse ecological effects not
   predicted by the Quotient Method, a laboratory-based risk assessment
   methodology used by the Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate
   pesticides for registration and use. We established populations of
   herbivorous gray-tailed voles (Microtus canicaudus) and omnivorous deer
   mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in 24 0.2-ha enclosures planted with
   alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and monitored the populations by live
   trapping. Alfalfa in twelve enclosures was mowed on 22 June to reduce
   vegetation height, and 3 wk later we applied azinphos-methyl at 0, 0.88,
   and 3.61 kg/ha. We compared predictions of risk with observed effects on
   the small mammals. Treatment with azinphos-methyl at 3.61 kg/ha reduced
   population density and growth, survival, recruitment, and body growth of
   voles in both mowed and unmowed enclosures. Survival of female voles
   exposed to 3.61 kg/ha was lower in mowed than in unmowed enclosures, and
   the 0.88 kg/ha treatment affected body growth of male voles only in
   mowed enclosures. Vole densities in 3.61 kg/ha enclosures remained
   depressed for greater than or equal to 6 wk after spraying.
   Azinphos-methyl did not detectably affect reproductive activity of
   female voles. Precipitation after spraying may have increased exposure
   of the mammals to azinphosmethyl, resulting in greater effects on voles
   than reported in a previous, similar experiment. Deer mouse densities in
   mowed enclosures receiving 3.61 kg/ha decreased 47\% within 5 d after
   spraying. No other adverse insecticide effects on deer mice were
   significant, but confidence intervals for such effects were wide.
   Analysis of deer mouse feces indicated that consumption of arthropods
   just after spraying was greater in insecticide-treated enclosures than
   in controls. In general, the Quotient Method adequately predicted
   effects on the small mammals, but its performance may be affected by
   vegetation structure and precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal abundance of the neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus
   heros (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), in overwintering sites in northern
   Parana state, Brazil (latitude 23 degrees 11' S, longitude 51 degrees
   11' W) was monitored from September 1994 to August 1995. The breaking of
   dormancy (oligopause) was studied in the laboratory by comparing the
   feeding activity and reproduction of adults collected in the held under
   different physiological conditions (i.e., dormant and non-dormant). No
   bugs were found in overwintering sites during the summer (December to
   February) and during early autumn (March). From mid-autumn to winter
   (April - August), the number of E. her-os captured in these sites
   gradually increased, decreasing thereafter with the start of spring in
   September. Dormant and nondormant E. heros taken to the laboratory and
   maintained at 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5\% rh., and L14:D10
   photoperiod, and given suitable food (soybean pods or seeds), began
   feeding immediately. The number of stylet sheaths deposited/day on the
   food was greater for non-dormant than for dormant adults. Feeding
   activity was greater on immature pods than on mature seeds of soybean.
   Dormant females placed under suitable biotic and abiotic conditions took
   ca. 2 weeks to start reproduction, in contrast to non-dormant females,
   which reproduced immediately.}},

Abstract = {{The behavioral and physiological effects of exposure to dimethoate, an
   organophosphate (OP) pesticide, were examined in common shrews, Sorer
   araneus, under laboratory conditions. Shrews were given either saline or
   an acute sublethal dose (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) of dimethoate, and a
   time course of behavior was recorded in five 10-min open field tests
   spaced over a 12-h period. Parallel measurements of brain
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were carried out to monitor the
   onset of brain AChE inhibition and its subsequent recovery. Dimethoate
   produced a significant depression of locomotor activity for approx. 6 h.
   Rearing, exploring, and sniffing activities were also significantly
   inhibited. The observed behavioral effects coincided with the maximal
   inhibition of AChE and disappeared before the brain AChE level had
   recovered. Statistically significant correlations were observed between
   the reduced frequencies of exploring, rearing, and crossings (a measure
   of locomotor activity) and the severity of inhibition of brain AChE
   activity, suggesting that brain AChE activity, the biomaker of exposure,
   could be used as a predictor of the severity of OP-induced effects on
   behavior.}},

Title = {{The significance of growth in Chironomus tentans sediment toxicity
   tests: Relationship to reproduction and demographic endpoints}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{In the Chironomus tentans 10-d growth test, changes in larval growth
   relative to sediment contamination are often ascribed ecological
   relevance by assuming that such changes become manifest at the
   population level through effects on reproductive output even though the
   relationship between growth and reproduction is poorly understood. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between growth
   and reproduction in C. tentans and to use these data in a demographic
   model to predict the growth and size of a theoretical population. Growth
   was manipulated by varying food supply (0.29, 0.33, 0.38, 0.42, 0.46,
   and 0.5 mg/individual per d). The test was initiated with 12 newly
   hatched larvae per replicate and carried through one complete
   generation. Larval growth and survival were determined at 20 d, and
   reproduction was monitored daily during emergence. Food supply did not
   significantly affect survivorship at any life stage; survival of larvae
   at 20 d, pupae, and adults exceeded 83\%, while survival of larvae in
   the reproduction replicates exceeded 65\%. Both larval and adult dry
   weight declined significantly with a reduction in food supply. Total
   emergence was reduced at the lowest feeding level only, whereas the rate
   of emergence declined at food supplies below 0.42 mg/individual per d.
   Based on the relationship between larval and adult dry weight, a minimum
   larval tissue mass of between 0.5 and 0.6 mg dry weight/individual
   appears to be necessary before emergence can take place. The number of
   eggs/female declined significantly with a decrease in food supply below
   0.42 mg/individual per d. Above this level (corresponding to larval dry
   weight of similar to 1.5 mg/individual), the addition of more food had
   no effect on reproductive output. Fecundity (number of daughters/female)
   and expected number of progeny declined linearly with reduced food
   supply. Application of the data in a demographic model showed that the
   growth and predicted size of a population would decline significantly
   with a decline in larval growth and reproductive output. These results
   demonstrate that changes in growth, positive or negative, can be used to
   make meaningful predictions regarding reproduction and population
   dynamics in the midge C. tentans.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative evaluation of radial transect and timed collection methods
   used in large-scale monitoring of abalone stocks in Victoria was
   undertaken. Methods were assessed according to their accuracy,
   precision, robustness and sensitivity (ability to detect change). Sample
   size required to detect a 50\% decrease was estimated using data from a
   pilot study, and three replicate stock depletion experiments were
   undertaken in a simple before/after design testing the null hypothesis
   of no change at the impacted sites. Harvesting was undertaken by
   commercial abalone divers. On all occasions, both methods were sensitive
   enough to detect the specified change and robust to both a significant
   effect of observer and violation of the assumption of equality of
   variances. No significant differences in precision occurred, however the
   30 m(2) transect estimated the actual number of abalone harvested to
   within 10\% of the true value. Only a weak linear relationship
   (pre-recruits r(2) = 0.12; post-recruits r(2) = 0.39) was observed
   between relative abundance (timed collection data) and absolute
   abundance (30 m(2) transect data). Importantly, the fishing behaviour
   (targeting of aggregations) of commercial abalone fishers resulted in
   much reduced variances for both transect estimates and timed
   collections, and consequently, increased power to detect a decrease in
   population size. In the long term however, this phenomenon may be offset
   by re-aggregation of populations, the extent of which needs to be
   throughly determined. Overall, the 30 m(2) transect was considered the
   safer, more robust method for long-term monitoring of abalone stocks.}},

Abstract = {{Activities associated with timber harvesting have occurred within
   floodplain forests in the southern United States for nearly two hundred
   years. However, it is only in the last ten years that any information
   has become available about the effects of harvesting on the ecological
   functions of this valuable resource. Hydrology is the driving influence
   behind all ecological processes in floodplains, and timber harvesting
   alone usually has little long-term effect on hydroperiod. However,
   logging roads, built in association with harvest sites, can sometimes
   alter hydroperiod to the extent that vegetation productivity is raised
   or lowered. There is no evidence that harvesting followed by natural
   regeneration represents a threat to ground or surface water quality on
   flood plain sites, as long as `'best management practices'' are
   followed. Harvested floodplains may increase or have little effect on
   decomposition rates of surface organic matter. The nature of the effect
   seems to be controlled by site wetness. Data from recently harvested
   sites (i.e. within the last ten years) suggest that vegetation
   productivity is maintained at levels similar to those observed prior to
   harvests. During the early stages of stand development, tree species
   composition is heavily influenced by harvest method. Similarly,
   amphibian populations (monitored as bioindicators of ecosystem recovery)
   seem to rebound rapidly following harvests, although species composition
   may be different from that of unharvested stands.}},

Abstract = {{1. In previous work we established that increasing temperature led to a
   destabilization of the population dynamics of the invertebrate carnivore
   Mesostoma ehrenbergii and its prey Daphnia pulex, which ultimately
   resulted in the local extinction of Daphnia at higher temperatures. Two
   mechanisms are proposed to explain the population-level phenomena: (1)
   quantitative changes in carnivore vital rates with Increasing
   temperature led to stronger functional and numerical response and (2)
   qualitative changes in the dynamic allocation of energy to reproduction
   by the predator with increasing temperature introduces inverse density
   dependence in the predator's response.
   2. The growth of individual M. ehrenbergii was monitored under various
   food conditions to determine the effect of two temperatures (18 and 24
   degrees C) and five food levels on rates of growth, prey consumption and
   reproduction and on reproductive allocation patterns.
   3. The first mechanism was supported by both higher consumption rates
   (stronger functional response) and faster growth rates with earlier age
   at maturity and shorter generation time (stronger numerical response).
   4. Evidence for mechanism two was also provided by an alteration of the
   reproductive allocation pattern with temperature. Viviparous
   (subitaneous) eggs were more likely to be produced by this carnivore at
   low food levels at 24 degrees C, while at 18 degrees C, high food levels
   were required before individuals made this switch. This shift actually
   introduces inverse density dependence in the predator's numerical
   response which is highly destabilizing.
   5. Based on the results of this study, the differential effect of M.
   ehrenbergii on the dynamics and structure of its D. pulex prey
   populations can be attributed to changes in both physiological rates and
   reproductive allocation patterns with temperature.}},

Title = {{Behavioural and distributional effects of hunting disturbance on
   waterbirds in Europe: Implications for refuge design}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},

Abstract = {{1. Based on studies of effects of hunting disturbance on local waterbird
   distribution and abundance, freedom from such disturbance is concluded
   to be an important part of waterbird management on nature conservation
   areas. Measures to mitigate the effects of disturbance from hunting are
   reviewed. These include complete removal of hunting in refuges, as well
   as spatial and temporal regulation of hunting activity in reserve areas
   outwith hunting-free refuges.
   2. Disturbance-free refuge design should take account of the ecological
   requirements of all species using a site and the functional units
   required to meet all daily activities, especially primary feeding and
   roosting areas used by waterbirds. Refuge size and shape must ensure
   birds are free from the effects of external disturbance. The most
   effective are of regular shape, maximum practicable size, and as a
   minimum should have a diameter of three times the escape flight distance
   of the most sensitive species present.
   3. Zoning in non-refuge areas can increase local bird numbers by
   restricting disturbance to regular predictable stimuli to which
   habituation is more likely. Mobile hunting activity close to roosting
   and/or feeding areas is more disturbing than hunting from fixed points
   or where birds are shot moving between such areas. Intermittent hunting
   is not an effective means of minimizing disturbance, but where
   implemented rest periods between hunting events should be considered in
   weeks rather than days.
   4. Most studies of mitigation techniques to minimize hunting disturbance
   have been descriptive and retrospective. Manipulative studies testing
   specific hypotheses are essential to create a sound scientific base for
   management.
   5. Management of hunting activity should take place within a broader
   management planning framework that identifies ideal and operational
   objectives in the management of the site, including feedback monitoring
   to determine the effectiveness of management prescriptions.
   6. We recommend that local site management planning should be integrated
   internationally, especially in the planning of refuge networks along
   migration corridors. Management actions in one part of a flyway may
   affect the ability of areas elsewhere to meet obligations to
   biodiversity conservation and maintenance of range under international
   law. In populations that are limited by winter resources, creation of a
   refuge network may offer a mechanism to enhance population size, but
   more large scale density dependence studies are required to confirm
   this.}},

Title = {{Estimating harbour seal abundance and status in an estuarine habitat in

Abstract = {{1. Harbour seals are the most widespread of pinniped species, coming
   ashore onto a variety of different habitats to rest, moult and breed.
   Estimates of their abundance and status rely on counts of animals in
   terrestrial haul-out groups but it is not clear to what extent current
   techniques are appropriate for all habitats.
   2. This study aimed to determine the most appropriate methods for
   estimating the abundance and status of harbour seals in an estuarine
   habitat in north-east Scotland. Regular low-tide counts were conducted
   to identify the best time for annual counts. Survey data for 1993 were
   then combined with telemetry data on seal activity to produce an
   estimate of abundance. Finally, simulations using data on the
   variability of counts within a single year were used to determine the
   power of these techniques to detect trends in abundance.
   3. The results suggest that annual counts conducted during the pupping
   season (mid-June to mid-July) provide the best estimates of abundance in
   this habitat. These results contrast with those from studies in
   rocky-shore habitats where counts made during the August moult provided
   more reliable abundance estimates.
   4. In 1993, an average of 1007 seals were hauled out at low tides during
   the period 15 June-15 July. There were significant differences in
   haul-out frequency for males (0.521 of low tides) and females (0.698 of
   low tides) but no within-sex variation was detected during this period.
   Combining the telemetry data with the results of counts from the Moray
   Firth produced an abundance estimate of 1653 (95\% confidence limits
   1471-1836).
   5. The potential effects of within and between-year variation in
   haul-out behaviour are discussed in relation to identifying suitable
   indices of abundance for trend analysis. In view of likely seasonal
   changes in the sex structure of haul-out groups, we recommend that
   programmes to monitor trends in harbour seal abundance should conduct
   annual counts at two different points in the annual cycle.}},
