Abstract = {{Current models for the interaction between ionising radiation and living
   cells or tissues are based on direct genetic damage produced by energy
   deposition in cellular DNA. An important observation which has
   questioned this basic assumption is the radiation-induced bystander
   response, in which cells which have not been directly targeted respond
   if their neighbours have been exposed. This response predominates at low
   dose, of relevance to radiation risk analysis (<0.2 Gy) and therefore
   needs to be fully characterised. The development of microbeams, which
   allow individual cells within populations to be targeted with precise
   doses of radiation, has provided a useful tool for quantifying this
   response. The authors' studies have targeted individual human and mouse
   cells with counted protons and helium ions, and monitored neighbouring
   cells for the production of bystander responses. Bystander responses
   have been measured after exposures as low as a single proton or helium
   ion delivered to an individual cell. An important aspect is that these
   responses saturate with increasing dose to the single target cell, thus
   the relative roles of direct and indirect (non-targeted) responses
   change with dose. Studies with multicellular, tissue-based models are
   providing evidence that bystander responses may have a complex phenotype
   involving multiple pathways and the overall response may be a balance
   between multiple signalling processes and responses to radiation
   exposure. Current models for radiation risk assume a linear
   non-threshold response and have generally been extrapolated from
   high-dose exposures. The involvement of competing processes at low doses
   may have important consequences for understanding the effects of
   low-dose exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Alentejo (South of Portugal) water reservoirs have, due to many factors,
   more probability of suffering eutrophication problems, which makes
   essential continuous monitoring. These water reservoirs are also one of
   the main water sources supply for population.
   A preliminary study concerning the project ``LANDSAT / IKONOS Applied to
   Water Quality Monitoring (LIWQ){''} is presented. It aims to develop a
   water quality monitoring system based on advanced remote sensing
   techniques for inland water reservoirs, using LANDSAT and IKONOS
   imagery.
   In order to determine the trophic state for Alentejo and Algarve most
   important drinking water reservoirs, we used the empirical approach
   developed by Palmeirim and Mariano(1) and estimated Carlson Trophic
   State Index(2) from chlorophyll and transparency values. This was
   related with field surveys data. This model was applied to Roxo, Monte
   Novo, Caia, Vigia, Alvito, Divor and Santa Clara water reservoirs using
   Landsat 5 TM (year 1997).
   IKONOS data have four multispectral bands similar to Landsat TM bands
   1-4 and high spatial resolution (4 m multispectral and I m
   panchromatic), which is potentially well suited for assessment of small
   lakes, such as Alentejo water reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{It is becoming increasingly recognized that computer methods such as
   models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be valuable tools
   for analyzing a geographical area in terms of it's hazards
   vulnerability, Vulnerability is an important aspect of households'
   experience of poverty. The measurement and analysis of poverty,
   inequality and vulnerability are crucial for cognitive purposes (to know
   what the situation is), for analytical purposes (to understand the
   factors determining this situation), for policy making purposes (to
   design interventions best adapted to the issues), and for monitoring and
   evaluation purposes (to assess whether current policies are effective,
   and whether the situation is changing). Here vulnerability defined as
   the probability or risk today of being in poverty - or falling deeper
   into poverty - in the future. Vulnerability is a key dimension of well
   being since it affects individuals' behavior (in terms of investment,
   production patterns, coping strategies) and their perception of their
   own situation. This study has been conducted with the joint
   collaboration of World Food Programme (WFP) and International Water
   Management Institute (IWMI) in Sri Lanka for identifying regions and
   population which are food insecure, for analyzing the reasons for
   vulnerability to food insecurity in order to provide decision-makers
   with information to identify possible sectors of intervention and for
   identifying where and for whom food aid can be best utilized in Sri
   Lanka. This new approach integrates GIS and Remote sensing with other
   statistical packages to allow consideration of more spatial/physical
   parameters like accessibility to economic resources, particularly land
   and the assets of the built environment, creating employment, and
   attracting investment in order to improve the quality and quantity of
   goods and services for the analysis which leads the analysis to
   represent the real scenario. For this study a detailed topographic data
   are being used along with MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and
   ASTER level 2 decor relation stretch data for vegetation cover images.
   Other social indicators of poverty, access to resources, communal
   services, social services, social tensions, Multi-ethnic collaboration,
   capacity for self governance, Government effectiveness and demographic
   data of Sri Lanka are also been used for this study. This paper
   illustrates the efforts of GIS and Remote Sensing applications along
   with Statistical Packages for Vulnerability analysis in terms of food
   insecurity and poverty and also addresses the ultimate utility of these
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{In considering `responsible fisheries', the focus usually is on
   potential effects of fisheries on ecosystems and habitats (i.e. effects
   of fisheries on the environment). For most, the term `responsible
   fisheries' implies a need for a change in fishing practices to protect
   or improve the state of the environment. The state of the environment,
   however, also inevitably affects fish and, thus, fisheries. Many
   societal activities influence the state of aquatic environments. Thus,
   in moving towards `responsible fisheries', changes in other societal
   activities rather than fisheries alone may also need to be considered.
   The indirect (i.e. non-fishing) effects on fish and fisheries can be
   divided into two types: those that affect ecosystem structure or
   population processes such that recruitment to the fishable stock is
   reduced, and those that affect the quality (and, hence, marketability)
   of the fish product. Environmental changes that can influence
   recruitment include land use changes that may alter habitats for fish.
   Damming and re-routing of streams and rivers may reduce access to
   spawning grounds for fishes that migrate between salt and freshwaters.
   Erosion (leading to increased turbidity) and eutrophication also lead to
   changes in habitats and food availability that can affect recruitment.
   Intentional and non-intentional introductions of new species to a region
   can alter ecosystems to the point that fisheries are severely affected.
   All of these influences are well described for individual stocks or
   local regions. However, a global assessment of the quantitative impact
   of such changes on fisheries is lacking.
   Chemical contamination of aquatic ecosystems can influence the
   physiology of organisms and accumulate in body tissues. Thus, both the
   recruitment and the marketability of fish products may be affected by
   contaminants. Many studies dealing with the potential toxicity of
   contaminants to physiological processes at the cell and organism level
   have been carried out. However, few studies have dealt with the effect
   of contaminants at the population level and thus attempted to quantify
   the effects of environmental contamination on fisheries. Monitoring of
   contaminant concentrations in fish meat is, in many regions of the
   world, standard protocol as part of public health protection measures,
   and some fisheries, especially in fresh and semi-enclosed marine waters,
   have been restricted as a result of such contamination. Although, in
   most cases, contaminant concentrations in wild fishes have been found to
   be below the levels considered to be safe for human consumption, recent
   studies have shown that, for example, dioxin contaminant levels in the
   muscle of wild fishes in the EU is higher than those found in meat
   produced in commercial agriculture. As knowledge concerning the effects
   of contaminants on human physiological processes increases, the
   contaminant concentrations considered as safe for human consumption are
   being reconsidered and, in some cases, reduced. Thus, the fact that wild
   fish meat is among the most contaminated with respect to dioxin of the
   common meat protein sources for the human population suggests that
   environmental effects on fisheries will be an area of increasing concern
   in coming years.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological data provide crucial information to evaluate the present
   status of vegetation, fish and/or wildlife communities. The assessment
   of the success (or failure) of river restoration (or rehabilitation) is
   only possible when ecological information was gathered before
   implementation. This means that monitoring is a crucial step in the
   planning of restoration projects and that it has to start in a very
   early stage of the planning process.
   During this project it was not our intention to start an extensive
   monitoring campaign. We decided to do a pre-restoration evaluation of
   the selected sites to see if restoration will most likely lead to a
   significant increase of the ecological value of the river system.
   In this paper we evaluate the fish assemblage and the macro-invertebrate
   communities, mainly on population level. These results were used to
   indicate the need for restoration. In one case (the Kernmelbeek) the
   pre-evaluation showed that restoration at the present state would
   probably not result in a higher ecological value. In this case,
   restoring a good water quality will be of higher priority than restoring
   meanders. On the other hand, meander restoration of 4 other sites will
   result in a higher ecological value. So these sites were proposed for
   remeandering.}},

Abstract = {{In these assessments of releases from copper smelters and refineries and
   from zinc plants as Priority Substances under the Canadian Environmental
   Protection Act (CEPA), available data were critically evaluated to
   determine if environmental exposure to selected components of these
   releases poses a risk to human health. The data on airborne levels of a
   variety of toxic substances near these facilities in Canada were
   obtained from the companies or provinces and systematically analyzed.
   Monitoring of ambient air near the Canadian copper smelters and
   refineries and zinc plants indicates that releases from these facilities
   result in increased potential for inhalation exposure of local human
   populations to several components of releases (As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, SO2
   and PM10). Airborne levels in the vicinity of these metal-processing
   operations overlap those associated with cardiorespiratory effects for
   PM10, and exceed health-based guideline's for SO2 and, near some
   facilities, Pb. In addition, the margin between levels of As, Cd, Cr and
   Ni near these facilities in Canada and carcinogenic potency for each of
   these metals is relatively small near copper smelters, larger near
   copper refineries, and intermediate near zinc plants. On this basis, the
   risk to human health from environmental exposure to releases from these
   facilities is considered to be high compared with other Priority
   Substances assessed under CEPA, especially for facilities where copper
   is smelted. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Core collections efficiently preserve genetic diversity and facilitate
   collection management and ``ex situ{''} conservation of genetic
   resources. Populus tremula (European aspen) is demanded by plant growers
   and breeders but there are very few data on the genetic variation in the
   geographic distribution of this species in Spain. Microsatellite markers
   are useful for the evaluation of genetic variability and identification
   due to their abundance and polymorphism. Six pairs of oligonucleotide
   primers designed for simple sequence repeats (SSR) of quaking aspen (P.
   tremuloides) were successfully used in European aspen. Number of alleles
   per locus were low in this species in comparison to outcrossed,
   long-lived woody perennials due to the importance of vegetative
   propagation by root suckers in aspen stands. Mean heterozygosity (0.475)
   was similar to that reported in quaking aspen. Cluster analysis suggests
   that postglacial migration of European aspen took place from the
   Pyrenees in two directions: westward and southward through mountain
   ranges of the Iberian Peninsula. To preserve the allelic richness of the
   R tremula in vitro collection in Spain, a core collection of 26 clones
   is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Size-frequency histograms are often used as a method of presenting
   observations of continuous variables which have been sampled
   discontinuously. For example, regular measurements of size are used to
   illustrate demographic changes. Growth rate in the field is sometimes
   inferred from such histograms. However, by considering results from a
   population of the terrestrial snail Monarch cantiana, it appears that
   size is not necessarily an indicator of age. This conclusion was reached
   by colour coding individual snails and then monitoring them for twelve
   months on arable land in South East England. These results have
   implications for many situations where intermittent sampling of snails
   leads to conclusions about cohort growth and recruitment of snails.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical baits have been the mainstay of slug control in crop production
   for many decades. The continued necessity for such products to protect
   crops in the future is emphasised, with current weather patterns and
   farming practices favouring slug activity and population build-up.
   Potential side effects from the main active ingredients are discussed
   and their implications considered to be relatively minor in practice.
   The integrated use of all means to minimise the slug threat to crops is
   supported, including the preparation of firm seedbeds and monitoring for
   slug activity to identify the need for bait application.}},

Abstract = {{In 1992, a study was begun to compare the effect of landfarming vs.
   natural attenuation on the restoration of soil that had been
   contaminated with crude oil. Each of three lysimeters was filled with a
   sandy loam topsoil, and crude oil was applied to two of the lysimeters.
   One of the contaminated lysimeters was tilled, watered, and received a
   one-time application of fertilizer (N, P, K). No amendments were added
   to the second contaminated lysimeter, and the third was left
   uncontaminated. The lysimeters were monitored for 6 months and then left
   unattended.
   In 1995 and again in 1997 we sampled these lysimeters to evaluate the
   long-term effects of contamination and bioremediation. In 1995 we found
   marked effects on soil chemistry, bacterial, fungal, nematode, and plant
   populations and a higher rate of bioremediation in the
   fertilized-contaminated lysimeter (Lawlor et al., 1997). Data from 1997
   and previously unreported data from 1995 are the subject of the current
   report. In 1997, low densities of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were
   found in all the lysimeters and little loss of TPH from the two
   contaminated lysimeters, suggesting a decreased rate of bioremediation.
   Nevertheless, there were increases in diversity and number of functional
   groups of bacteria, nematodes, and native plant species. However,
   molecular analyses revealed marked differences remained in the
   composition of dominant eubacterial species, and tests of soybeans
   indicated field conditions remained unsuitable for these plants.}},

Abstract = {{Sclersopora graminicola, the causal agent of pearl millet downy mildew,
   is heterothallic and reproduces both sexually and asexually. Pathogenic
   variability in S. graminicola is known in both Africa and India.
   Host-specific evolution of virulence occurs in the pathogen,,especially
   to genetically homogeneous single-cross F-1 hybrids in India. Virulence
   monitoring through a collaborative international virulence nursery and
   field surveys in India have provided useful information on virulence
   diversity. Genotypic differences in host-specific virulent isolates have
   been identified by using DNA fingerprinting markers. Quantitative trait
   locus (QTL) mapping for,downy mildew resistance against different
   pathotypes from Africa and India has confirmed the presence of variable
   pathotypes. Developing cultivars with resistance to specific pathotypes
   and resistance gene pyramiding against multiple pathotypes through
   marker-assisted backcrossing could lead to cultivars with durable
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, eastern woodrats (Neotoma floridana, Ord) at Pine Hills,
   Union County, were believed to be the only extant population in
   Illinois. During 1994, additional populations in adjacent Jackson County
   were discovered at Fountain Bluff, Horseshoe Bluff, and Little Grand
   Canyon. Genetic variation among Illinois woodrat populations was
   estimated based on microsatellite DNA at 6 loci. The four populations
   were separated by 2-14 km, yet all exhibited significant genetic
   differentiation. Fountain Bluff was the most geographically isolated
   population and had the lowest genetic heterozygosity. A sample of
   individuals from a more contiguous population in Missouri exhibited the
   highest heterozygosity. Populations were monitored by mark-recapture
   live-trapping for 39 months at Pine Hills and 19 months at Fountain
   Bluff. Although the Fountain Bluff population was smaller than the Pine
   Hills population, seasonal demographics and reproductive output were
   similar. Natural dispersal from all 4 populations was limited by
   fragmented habitat, natural barriers, and anthropogenic barriers.
   Reintroductions of woodrats may be necessary for the species to
   repopulate formerly occupied sites throughout southern Illinois.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the federally threatened eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon
   couperi) from 1992 to 2002 in southeastern Georgia, including a 4-year
   mark-recapture study conducted on the Fort Stewart Military Reservation.
   Indigo snakes in this region are sexually dimorphic in size, with males
   attaining greater maximum lengths. Subadult and small adult snakes grow
   more rapidly than larger adults. Georgia specimens prey on a variety of
   vertebrates, including juvenile gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus).
   The return of adult indigo snakes to the same sandhills in multiple
   years has conservation and management significance. Long-term population
   monitoring of indigo snakes is feasible and may yield valuable
   information.}},

Abstract = {{The Tallapoosa darter (Etheostoma tallapoosae) is only found in the
   Piedmont portion of the Tallapoosa River system which spans Georgia and
   Alabama. Particularly in western Georgia headwaters, the habitat of this
   darter is potentially threatened by human population growth. The purpose
   of this study was to assess the extent of genetic variation and genetic
   structuring of this species to determine if those populations at
   greatest risk are genetically unique and would thus raise conservation
   concerns. Mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b sequences were
   determined for thirteen populations spanning the length of this species'
   range. Phylogenetic analysis and analysis of molecular variance shows
   that while the populations in western Georgia headwaters are not
   genetically unique, the Tallapoosa darter population is subdivided into
   genetically divergent populations that can be designated as management
   units for future monitoring of the species.}},

Abstract = {{We sampled a population of two species of hylid treefrogs using 90
   vertical ground-placed PVC pipes of 3 diameters positioned along a

Abstract = {{Urban growth is continuously applying pressure on resources,
   infrastructures and facilities, negatively affecting the standard of
   living in cities. In this context, evaluating and monitoring the urban
   environmental quality has become a main issue, particularly important
   when considered as a decision-support tool that contributes to more
   livable and sustainable cities.
   Viana do Castelo is a mid-sized city located on the northwest Portuguese
   seaside, which undertook the challenge of developing an environmental
   program leading to the integration in a Healthy Cities European Network.
   Within this program, the identification of urban noise levels and people
   exposure was considered a priority. The scientific toolbox adopted to
   develop the studies includes noise simulation models and a GIS platform.
   Based on traffic data and site physical characteristics, acoustical maps
   were created and overlaid together with the land-use-based acoustic
   zoning and population distribution layers.
   This combination was the basis for the identification of critical zones,
   both in terms of noise levels and people exposure to this kind of
   pollution.
   This paper aims to present the approach, including the theoretical
   framework, and to discuss the results of a summer scenario of noise
   exposure in the city center.}},

Abstract = {{Izmir is a large metropolitan city with a population of 3,114,860. The
   city consists of 27 townships, each township has a population of not
   less than 10,000 inhabitants. The two major solid waste disposal sites
   are in the townships of Uzundere and Harmandali. The amount of solid
   waste that is disposed at each of these sites is about 800 and 1800
   t/day, respectively. In Uzundere, compost is produced from the organic
   fraction of urban solid wastes while the residual material is deposited
   at a disposal site with a remaining capacity of 700,000 m(3) as of 2001.
   Gas monitoring and measurements were carried out at the disposal site in
   Uzundere. For this purpose, nine sampling wells were drilled on selected
   locations. Each well was furnished with perforated metal pipes suitable
   for gas monitoring and measurements. The following gases were monitored:
   O-2, CH4, CO, CO2, and H2S. The most important finding was that the
   concentrations of CH4 in the wells ranged from 7 to 57\%. Dilution of
   the CH4 by O-2 down to the LEL levels (5-15\%) is always possible and
   poses a continuing risk at the site. Furthermore, the levels of O-2
   require that access to the site be limited to only authorized personnel.

Abstract = {{New technologies for reducing the sludge production of municipal or
   industrial WWTP have been appeared during the last few years. One of
   these innovative processes, Bio THELYS(R), consists in enhancing the
   biodegradability of sludge by a stage of thermal hydrolysis. The
   hydrolysed sludge could then be sent upstream to a biological step
   either aerobic or anaerobic. The objective is to increase the global
   mineralisation of the pollution entering the WWTP in order to decrease
   the waste leaving it, i.e. mainly the sludge. A 2500 population
   equivalent prototype was installed on a WWTP, in Champagne - France.
   Thermal hydrolysis is carried out under a temperature of
   150-185degreesC, a pressure of 10-15 bar with an hydraulic retention
   time of 30-60 minutes. Thermal hydrolysis is implemented on a secondary
   recycling loop on the biological basin. Trials started in 1999 and are
   still on operation. A close monitoring of the WWTP was set up focusing
   especially on sludge characteristics, treated water quality, yield of
   sludge production reduction and plant operation. Bio THELYS(R) could
   achieve a reduction in sludge production up to 70\% on the plant.}},

Abstract = {{Odour control and dewaterability are the key criteria during biosolids
   storage either for use on land or incineration. In the case of use on
   land, stabilisation/sanitisation are also part of the key criteria.
   Vivendi Water Systems developed the SAPHYR(R) process to answer those
   three requirements. The SAPHYR(R) process principle is based on an
   acidification of biosolids associated to the addition of nitrite. The
   main results are a noticeable odour control lasting other periods of 6
   to 9 months, an improved dewaterability (2 to 4 points of dryness) and
   depending on chemical dosages a stabilisation or a sanitisation of
   biosolids. Another characteristic is that biosolids conditioned with the
   Saphyr process can be used both on land or for incineration. After
   several demonstrations on more than 5 different plants throughout France
   on a 10 000 p.e. unit, the first industrial reference of the process was
   installed on a 50 000 population equivalent wastewater treatment plant
   in 2002 and has been in operation since december 2002. A close
   monitoring of the process operation, the biosolids quality and its
   storage and spreading on land is planned from November 2002 to spring
   2003. A comparison with lime addition will take place on the same plant.
   The present paper will produce a presentation of the SAPHYR(R) process,
   its operation on a 50 000 pe WWTP and its different applications for
   biosolids storage.}},

   retrieved at 10- and 15-m depth lines than at a 5-m depth line. While
   southwest monsoon caused increased bacterial input to the coastal
   sediment of Nagore, cyclonic effect on indicators was observed only in
   the water samples. Although physicochemical parameters did not influence
   the variation in coliform population significantly, most of the
   indicators in the sediment showed significant negative correlation with
   chlorophyll a, indicating an inverse relationship between them. With
   ever increasing development of Nagore, nonpoint sources of pollution may
   become a serious problem. Continued monitoring of these groups of
   bacteria over longer periods of time would help develop models for their
   regulation and may suggest remedial measures.}},

Abstract = {{A heat flux bench-scale calorimeter (Bio-RC1) has been used to assess
   the metabolic activity of microbial populations involved in wastewater
   treatment biological processes under aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic
   conditions. Under strictly aerobic conditions, a linear correlation was
   observed between oxygen uptake rate and heat flux for heterotrophic and
   nitrifying bacterial populations. Using the same calorimetric approach
   and the same apparatus, toxicity and biodegradability of a pesticides
   factory wastewater were investigated. The activity of heterotrophic and
   nitrifying aerobic communities was monitored considering both oxygen
   consumption and heat dissipation, whereas, under anoxic conditions,
   calorimetric data were compared to the traditional NUR (nitrate uptake
   rate) test. Heterotrophic activity was found to be 52\% inhibited after
   toxic wastewater exposure under both aerobic and anoxic conditions and
   30\% inhibition was observed on autotrophic ammonia oxidation.
   Additionally, calorimetric measurements have been successfully applied
   to investigate anaerobic digestion. The thermal response of a mesophilic
   granular sludge to repetitive glucose pulses has been evaluated and a
   toxicity test has been performed by exposing the biomass to increasing
   concentrations of formaldehyde.}},

   checks), and to develop the precise procedure for the landfills. The
   combination of geochemical and microbiological methods to estimate and
   monitor the oxidation and emission of methane in landfills during
   different seasons is proposed. It includes the measurements, both on the
   surface and at different depths (up to 1 m) of landfill ground of the
   following parameters: (1) concentrations of methane, carbon dioxide and
   oxygen; (2) quantity of C-13 isotope in gas samples; (3)
   methane-oxidation activity of landfill grounds assayed with two
   different methods: (a) in conditions of no moisture or substrate

Abstract = {{The first Irish municipal application of a hybrid reed bed treatment
   system (RBTS) was designed and constructed at Colecott, County Dubin.
   The hybrid design for Colecott RBTS was based on modifications to the
   Max Planck Institute Process (MPIP). The constituent parts of the design
   were a septic tank, a pump sump, two stage vertical flow beds, a
   secondary settlement tank, a horizontal reed bed, an outlet chamber and
   outfall pipe. The population at the time of design was 48, but with
   future development in mind 60 was used as the population equivalent
   (pe). Construction and operational characteristics are outlined. Results
   of a two year monitoring study are presented, showing good performance
   and producing a final effluent with 88\% BOD removal, 89\% COD removal
   and 99\% SS removal.
   Percentile compliance with EU discharge standards were BOD 60\%, COD
   100\%, SS 100\% with 50\% for nitrogen and 0\% for PO4. Surface water
   input increased flows to twice the average, resulting in increased
   maintenance visits without affecting results. The ability to deal with
   the excess inflow is demonstrated by the system. The method of
   distribution to the primary vertical beds was satisfactory while that on
   the secondary vertical beds was not.}},

   rates of re-aeration, photosynthesis and respiration, using a
   process-based analytical technique (the Delta method). In-situ
   fluorimeter measurements of chlorophyll were ground-truthed on a
   fortnightly basis using laboratory methanol extraction of chlorophyll
   and spectrophotometric analysis. Water samples were also analysed for
   algal species on a fortnightly basis. The river and canal exhibited very
   similar rates of photosynthesis and respiration during the summer of
   2001, despite much higher chlorophyll concentrations and total algal
   counts, indicating that benthic algae and/or aquatic macrophytes may be
   making an important contribution to photosynthesis rates in the river.
   Suspended algal populations in the canal are dominated by planktonic
   species, whereas the river has a higher proportion of species which are
   predominantly benthic in habitat. The river exhibited higher rates of
   respiration, reflecting a higher organic loading from external (e.g.
   sewage effluent) sources.}},

Abstract = {{Watercare's Mangere Wastewater Treatment Plant in Auckland, New Zealand
   treats sewage from a population equivalent of approximately 1,000,000.
   The treatment plant is currently undergoing a major upgrade, and as a
   part of this upgrade the largest UV disinfection plant in the world (at
   the time of award of the contract) is being constructed.
   Pilot scale investigations were undertaken at a purpose built facility.
   The pilot plant employed secondary treatment, sand filtration, UV
   disinfection and a number of low pressure membrane systems.
   Investigations at the facility focussed on attempting to identify
   relationships between potential surrogate indicator organisms (including
   enterococci, faecal coliforms, Clostridium perfringens spores and
   F-specific bacteriophage) and pathogenic organisms (including culturable
   human enteric viruses, bacterial pathogens and parasites).
   The aim of the study was to identify a suitable indicator organism and
   an associated effluent concentration that would ensure that an
   acceptable level of public health risk was maintained in the
   environment.
   The results showed that no suitable surrogate indicator organism could
   be found. However the results did indicate that a two tiered operating
   strategy, based on the concentration of enteroviruses present in raw
   sewage and an appropriate UV dose, would ensure that an acceptable level
   of public health risk was maintained in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely used for the production of epoxy resins and
   polycarbonate plastics and is considered an endocrine disruptor. Special
   in vitro test systems and animal experiments showed a weak estrogenic
   activity. Aquatic wildlife especially could be endangered by waste water
   discharges. To manage possible risks arising from BPA emissions the
   major fluxes need to be investigated and the sources of the
   contamination of municipal treatment plants need to be determined. In
   this study, five major industrial point sources, two different household
   areas and the influent and effluent of the corresponding treatment plant
   (WWTP). were monitored simultaneously at a plant serving 120,000
   population equivalents. A paper producing plant was the major BPA
   contributor to the influent load of the wastewater treatment plant. All
   the other emissions from point sources, including the two household
   areas, were considerably lower. The minimum elimination rate in the WTTP
   could be determined at 78\% with an average of 89\% of the total
   BPA-load: For a possible pollution-forecast, or for a comparison between
   different point sources, emission factors based on COD-emissions were
   calculated for industrial and household point sources at BPA/COD-ratios
   between 1.4 x 10(-6)-125 x 10(-6) and 1.3 x 10(-8)-6.3 x 10(-6),

Abstract = {{A non-optimised treatment of wastewaters containing organic and
   biological substances is very often accompanied by an accidental
   emanation of hydrogen sulphide H2S and therefore leads (i) to an
   undesirable odour in the vicinity of water treatment plants, and (ii) to
   a potential hazard for the neighbouring population. Fast, sensitive and
   reliable monitoring devices are hence of significant importance.
   Chalcogenide and chalcohalide glasses are new promising membrane
   materials for detection of heavy metal ions and toxic anions and
   particularly well adapted for continuous in situ monitoring and
   industrial process control: In the present paper, we will discuss
   analytical characteristics of new chalcogenide glass chemical sensors
   for detection of S2- and dissolved H2S, which allow reliable process
   control to be carried out at natural pH of wastewaters.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization increases the variety and amount of pollutants transported
   to receiving waters. Sediment from development and new construction;
   oil, grease, and toxic chemicals from automobiles; nutrients and
   pesticides from turf management and gardening; viruses and bacteria from
   failing septic systems; road salts; and heavy metals are examples of
   pollutants generated in urban areas. Sediments and solids constitute the
   largest volume of pollutant loads to receiving waters in urban areas.
   When runoff enters storm drains, it carries many of these pollutants
   with it. In older cities, this polluted runoff is often released
   directly into open waterways without any treatment. Increased pollutant
   loads can harm fish and wildlife populations, kill native vegetation,
   foul drinking water supplies, and make recreational areas unsafe.
   The objective of the study, performed by University of Pavia (Italy),
   University of Brescia (Italy) and GreenTechTexas International (US),
   reported herein is to evaluate the use of an innovative stormwater
   technology (EcoDrain(TM)) to reduce pollution due to urban runoff in
   existing urban areas.
   The paper describes the methodology and the results achieved with tests
   conducted in laboratory in Pavia University in Italy and in two pilot
   areas in Italy and in Australia to investigate the EcoDrain's
   effectiveness for oil and heavy metals retention and sediment trapping.
   In the tests performed in a marina near Sidney in Australia a reduction
   has been achieved in oil and grease concentration higher than 95\% and a
   reduction in metal concentration (particularly Copper, Lead and Zinc)
   close to 98\%.
   The paper also describes the methodology of the analysis on the
   absorbing material after its use and the consequent determination of the
   most efficient and environmentally safe way to dispose of consummated
   absorbent.}},

   densities were monitored, and soil samples were taken to measure the
   effects of the treatments on weed seedbanks and microbial biomass over a
   24-mo period. Reduced tillage increased the density of shepherd's-purse
   in the upper soil layer (0 to 15 cm) of the soil seedbank compared with
   conventional tillage. Evidence is presented that suggests relationships
   between organic amendments, weed population reductions, and increases in
   soil microbial biomass: (1) shepherd's-purse emergence and seedbank
   densities were lower in the organic amendment plots, (2) microbial
   biomass was nearly always higher in the organic amendment plots, and (3)
   significant negative correlations between microbial biomass and burning
   nettle and shepherd's-purse emergence densities were found. These
   results suggest that organic matter addition may lead to reduced weed
   emergence.}},

Abstract = {{Collserola Park in northeastern Spain is an 8,000 ha Mediterranean
   forest park surrounded by the Barcelona metropolitan area with a
   population of some three million inhabitants. Wild boar Sus scrofa are
   common in Collserola and cause specific management problems. We obtained
   information on their activity and habitat use in different areas of the
   park by use of two field methods: prospecting of non-linear transects at
   night on foot and periodic monitoring of sign-survey plots. Prospecting
   of routes on foot provided information on summer nocturnal activity in
   different natural and semi-natural environments: feeding activity takes
   place mainly during 00:00-05:00, and the maximum amount of movements was
   registered during 20:00-00:00 and at dawn. Wild boar feeding activity
   was significantly lower on dry slopes than in other habitat types such
   as riparian woodland, valley bottoms and agricultural areas.
   Pellet-group density varied significantly between habitats, being higher
   in agricultural habitats, intermediate in riparian woodland and lowest
   on wooded slopes. In general, pellet-group density was higher on level
   ground than on slopes. The mean surface area rooted by wild boar was
   less than 5\% in all survey periods. Rooting activity, which was
   dominated by surface rooting, was highest in winter and lowest in summer
   when soil conditions for rooting were poorest. Rooting activity varied
   significantly between habitat types, and distinct seasonal patterns were
   observed within individual habitat areas. The results we obtained
   support the view that the summer is a critical period for wild boar in
   Mediterranean environments and highlight the importance of ensuring
   certain scarce habitats for foraging activities during this season.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of non-toxic baits was monitored during a simulated
   trail-baiting programme for foxes and wild dogs in the central
   tablelands of New South Wales. Ninety-one buried baits were removed by a
   number of species including spotted-tailed quolls, Australian
   brush-turkeys, superb lyrebirds, small mammals, wild dogs and a red fox.
   Spotted-tailed quolls were significantly less likely to remove baits
   buried under the ground surface than baits buried in raised mounds of
   soil. By means of remote photography, individual quolls were identified
   removing 3-4 baits in one night from bait stations 400 m apart. The
   results of this study show that spotted-tailed quolls and other
   non-target species may face substantial risk of consuming baits intended
   for wild dogs and foxes. However, the risk of poisoning spotted-tailed
   quolls may be significantly reduced by appropriate planning.
   Recommendations are made to increase the target-specificity of baiting
   programmes in areas with populations of spotted-tailed quolls.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of little penguin nest sites on Montague Island, New
   South Wales, was examined in relation to vegetation type, distance to
   landing sites and local footpaths. Nest site density was negatively
   correlated with distance to landing sites and positively correlated with
   distance to footpaths. The latter may be related to disturbance.
   Comparisons with the transect data of previous years showed a
   significant shift in nest distribution away from areas dominated by
   dense kikuyu grass. In October 2000, the little penguin population on
   Montague Island was estimated at 5000 breeding pairs. However, repeat
   surveys in November and December showed that single counts underestimate
   the actual size of the breeding population. This study has demonstrated
   the value of line transects to examine the relationship between little
   penguins and their breeding habitat. Transect surveys on Montague Island
   should continue in future years to monitor the effects of ongoing
   vegetation changes on nest distribution and population size.}},

Abstract = {{In 1985 new silvicultural prescriptions for managing jarrah ( Eucalyptus
   marginata) forest in south- west Western Australia came into operation.
   The most extreme logging treatment ( gap release) involved removal of
   most of the overstorey from patches no larger than 10 ha, followed by a
   regeneration fire. In the other logging treatment ( shelterwood), less
   wood was removed from a larger area, also followed by a fire. This study
   examined the impact of these disturbances on the avifauna by monitoring
   species richness and abundance of birds one year before logging, one
   year before burning, and for five years after burning. Although 68 bird
   species were recorded during the seven years of the study, 29 of these
   were detected fewer than 15 times. Of the other 39 bird species
   recorded, only two ( Gerygone fusca and Acanthiza apicalis) showed a
   statistically significant treatment effect over time on their abundance.
   The abundance of G. fusca initially declined in the disturbed treatments
   and by Year 7 of the study ( 5 years post-fire) in the gap-release
   treatment had not recovered its original abundance. A. apicalis
   increased its abundance in both shelterwood and gap-release treatments.
   By Year 7, both species in the logged treatments had abundances similar
   to those in the unlogged treatments. Total abundance of all species
   varied little across treatments. Species richness was highest by Year 7
   in the shelterwood and lowest in the gap-release treatment. In some
   years community structure varied more at the external-reference sites (
   not recently logged or burnt) than at the gap-release sites. In
   particular, there was little overlap in community structure in the
   external-reference treatment between the first and final years, whereas
   the pre-logging and final year in the gap-release treatment showed a
   high degree of overlap. These differences are suggestive of overriding
   short-term annual variation in broad-scale factors rather than local
   factors. Yearly variation in rainfall and temperature was documented;
   during low rainfall periods, populations of foliage arthropods may have
   been reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Following bushfires in Sydney in 1994 a population of 20 - 30 common
   ringtail possums ( Pseudocheirus peregrinus) that had been studied for
   four years was reduced to only one or two animals. In the intervening
   years population numbers remained at this low level. Four years after
   the fire, 22 ringtail possums were introduced into the study site and
   radio-tracked for 30 weeks. Nest usage shifted from predominantly dreys
   before the fire to an equal amount of time spent in dreys and tree
   hollows. Proportionally, the mortality due to predation by lace monitors
   ( Varanus varius) and diamond pythons ( Morelia spilota spilota)
   increased. Within 12 months the population returned to only two animals.
   We conclude that increased predation by native predators, added to
   continued predation by foxes and cats, has maintained a level of
   predation beyond a threshold that would allow the ringtail population to
   re-establish to previous levels.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995, the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, the Queensland
   Department of Main Roads and Redland Shire Council initiated the Koala
   Speed Zone Trial in the Koala Coast, south-east Queensland. The aim of
   the trial was to assess the effect of differential speed signs on the
   number of koalas ( Phascolarctos cinereus) hit by vehicles in the Koala
   Coast from 1995 to 1999. On the basis of information collected by the
   Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service 1407 koalas were hit by vehicles
   in the Koala Coast during the five-year study ( mean 281 koalas per
   year, range 251 - 315). Monitoring of vehicle speeds by the Queensland
   Department of Main Roads suggested that there was no significant
   reduction in vehicle speed during the trial period from August to
   December. Consequently, there was no evidence to suggest that a
   reduction in the number of koalas hit by vehicles occurred during the
   trial. Approximately 70\% of koalas were hit on arterial and
   sub-arterial roads and approximately 83\% did not survive. The location
   of each koala hit was recorded and the signed speed limit of the road
   was noted. Most koalas that were hit by vehicles were young healthy
   males. Pooling of data on koala collisions and road speed limits
   suggested that the proportion of koalas that survived being hit by
   vehicles was slightly higher on roads with lower speed limits. However,
   vehicle speed was not the only factor that affected the number of koalas
   hit by vehicles. It is suggested that habitat destruction, koala density
   and traffic volume also contribute to road-associated koala mortality in
   the Koala Coast.}},

Abstract = {{We critically evaluated population-monitoring programs for three
   endangered species of Australian honeyeater: the regent honeyeater,
   Xanthomyza phrygia, the black-eared miner, Manorina melanotis, and the
   helmeted honeyeater, Lichenostomus melanops cassidix (Meliphagidae). Our
   results challenge the common assumption that meaningful monitoring is
   possible in all species within the five-year lifetime of recovery plans.
   We found that the precision achievable from monitoring programs not only
   depends on the monitoring technique applied but also on the species'
   biology. Relevant life-history attributes include a species' pattern of
   movement, its home-range size and its distribution. How well understood
   and predictable these attributes are will also influence monitoring
   precision. Our results highlight the large degree of variability in
   precision among monitoring programs and the value of applying power
   analysis before continuing longer-term studies. They also suggest that
   managers and funding agencies should be mindful that more easily
   monitored species should not receive preferential treatment over species
   that prove more difficult to monitor.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting activity of a population of malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata),
   isolated within a small mallee remnant in central New South Wales, was
   monitored annually between the summers of 1986-87 and 1998-99. A total
   of 148 nesting events was recorded. Only once was a new mound
   constructed rather than an old one reworked. Birds began and finished
   work on the mound progressively later each month (October to January).
   Nest-site fidelity was highly variable; some pairs persisted with the
   same mound for up to nine years while others relocated between a cluster
   of two, three or four mounds. Males displayed greater nest-site fidelity
   than females. After the loss of a partner, males tended to continue to
   use mounds they had used previously whereas females often relocated to a
   new mound. All individuals were monogamous. Pair bonds were maintained
   for life but, following the death of a partner, new bonds were quickly
   established with another unattached individual. Established pairs
   occasionally failed to breed, all such failures being coincident with
   years of low rainfall. Pairs that did not breed generally began
   construction of a nest but failed to complete the task. As far as can be
   ascertained, unpaired birds did not construct nests. The malleefowl
   population was characterised by a rapid turnover of breeding
   individuals, a high rate of adult mortality and a lesser rate of
   recruitment. The maximum longevity recorded for breeding adults was 12
   years; average longevity was 7.5 years. Twenty-five adults were lost
   from the breeding population over a period of 9 years; meanwhile, 14
   birds entered the breeding population. Thus, the ratio of adult
   mortality to recruitment was 1.79:1.00. Between 1986-87 and 1997-98 the
   population declined from at least 32 breeding adults to 14, at an
   average exponential rate of decrease of 0.075. Large population
   decreases were coincident with years of low rainfall. This population of
   malleefowl is predicted to become extinct by 2008.}},

   continuous applications of pyrimethanil and cyprodinil have been carried
   out since 1995 but also at two locations where these new chemicals had
   never been used before. Among the strains of B. cinerea collected in
   various Croatian vineyards during 1998 and 1999, a few exhibited a high

Abstract = {{Over a period of 3 years, five reproductively active female nurse sharks
   (Ginglymostoma cirratum) from a wild, actively mating population of
   nurse sharks were captured, confined, and periodically examined through
   the course of gestation to determine the gestation period and
   characterize paternity. In the final year of the study, candidate
   animals were first evaluated in the field by ultrasonography, and the
   selected animals were then transported from the study site to holding
   facilities at SeaWorld Adventure Parks in Orlando, Florida. Periodic
   monitoring of the animals was conducted by ultrasonography, endoscopy,
   and routine blood analysis. Gestation was determined to be a minimum of
   131 days, multiple paternity was shown for two individual litters, and
   ultrasonography and endoscopy were shown to be useful adjuncts for
   assessing pregnancy and monitoring gestation in this species. Poor
   survival of offspring, and small litter size may be a consequence of
   handling and transporting the animals, and the use of invasive
   procedures such as endoscopy. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Immunocontraception has become an increasingly valuable tool in the

   previous study with fallow deer (Cervus dama) suggested that the vaccine
   did not work in this species. In the current study, PZP was tested in
   two captive herds of fallow deer. Antibody titers were monitored over a
   3-year period to evaluate three different adjuvant protocols, and the
   vaccine was applied to an entire herd to determine the impact on fawning
   rates. In a semi-free-ranging herd, antibody titers rose from
   preimmunization levels of 2.6\% of positive control serum to 56.5\% 4
   weeks after initial inoculations, to 65.1\% at 1 year, and to 81.3\% at
   2 years, after a single annual booster was applied. Fawn production in
   this herd was reduced significantly over 3 years. The adjuvant protocol
   of Freund's Modified Adjuvant(R) (FMA) for the initial inoculation
   followed by a booster with Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant(R) (FIA), and
   the protocol of FMA for the initial inoculation followed in 3 weeks by a
   booster with FMA both produced significantly higher antibody titers than
   the 3 x FIA (3 weeks apart) protocol after year 1. The FMA + FMA

Abstract = {{The giant panda is critically endangered in its native habitat, which is
   continually depreciated by the pressure of human population growth, and
   the small captive population is not yet self-sustaining. Female giant
   pandas are seasonally monoestrous With spontaneous Ovulation. Precise
   monitoring of the estrous cycle to pinpoint the time Of Ovulation is
   critical for the Success of both timed mating and artificial
   insemination. Vaginal cytology is a Useful adjunct to endocrinological
   data in describing the estrous Cycle in many species, including domestic
   carnivores; however, it has not been used effectively in the giant
   panda. In this study, vaginal swabs were obtained from four nulliparous
   females ranging in age from 6 to 14 years. Cells were stained with
   Papanicolaou stain and classified as basophils, intermediate cells, or
   superficial cells based on traditional criteria. In addition, cell color
   changes from the basophilic through the acidophilic and keratinized
   stages were recorded. The size and color of the vulva of a single female
   was scored daily on a scale of 0-3, with anestrus characterized as 0.
   The day of Ovulation was retrospectively designated as day 0 based oil
   urinary estrogen concentrations, behavior, and morphological indicators.
   The vulva began to swell between days -11 and -9, with peak tumescence
   on the day Of Ovulation. The percentage of superficial cells began to
   increase by day -8 to -7, and peaked between days -2 and + 2. A chromic
   shift Occurred oil day -8, when the majority of vaginal cells changed
   from basophilic to acidophilic without any accompanying nuclear or
   cytoplasmic changes. A second chromic shift was observed oil day -2,
   when keratinized cells replaced acidophilic cells as the majority of
   vaginal cells. By day +4, all parameters had returned to baseline except
   vulvar swelling, which slowly subsided over the next several days. These
   data show the correlation of trichrome-stained vaginal cytology with
   other measured indicators of estrus in the giant panda, and its
   predictive value in determining the time of ovulation. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{In risk evaluation of dioxins, monitoring chemical concentrations in
   human tissues is an important step, and these concentration data can be
   utilized along with animal toxicity data for extrapolation of human
   manifestation. However large differences in dioxin concentrations
   usually exist even among individuals who have never been accidentally
   exposed to high quantities of dioxin, and this may cause problems in
   risk analysis. Body size, age, and history of food consumption are
   factors responsible for these interindividual differences in addition to
   exposure levels. Using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
   model, the influence of differences in body weight, gastrointestinal
   absorption, and half-life and intake of dioxin were examined on tissue
   chemical concentration. Dioxin concentrations over a 40-yr time course
   in human liver, kidneys, fat, blood muscle and richly perfused tissue
   were simulated for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs),
   polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and coplanar polychlorinated
   biphenyls (CoPCBS). Model parameters such as tissue-blood partition
   coefficients for CoPCBs were prepared, and sensitivity analysis was also
   performed on these parameters. The range of tissue concentrations was
   approximately 0.17 to 4.1 times the standard concentration, which was
   calculated using standard model parameters. The simulated ranges
   included more than 80\% of the individual anatomical data for
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 1, 2,3,
   7,-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and 3,3,4,4,5-pentachlorobiphenyl in
   liver, fat, and blood. These results suggest that differences in body
   weight, gastrointestinal absorption, and food intake behavior may
   partially explain variation in tissue concentrations among individuals,
   and the possible interindividual uncertainty, which is approximately 24
   for the general Japanese population.}},

Title = {{Disturbance by wrack facilitates spread of Phragmites australis in a
   coastal marsh}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is an important factor facilitating the spread of nuisance
   and invasive species. Over the past century, the grass Phragmites
   australis has been spreading aggressively throughout coastal marshes of
   North America and is now considered a nuisance species in many regions.
   In this study, I examine how natural disturbance by wrack (primarily
   dead plant material of the native grass Spartina alterniflora) affects
   the local spread of stands of P. australis in a coastal marsh in
   southern New England, USA. A survey indicated that wrack covered 8.4\%
   of the marsh and that a disproportionate amount of wrack (73\% of wrack
   cover) is stranded at the highest tidal elevations of the marsh next to
   stands of P. australis. To test hypotheses that wrack inhibits or
   facilitates the seaward spread of P. australis, I did two experiments
   where I manipulated the presence or absence of wrack next to stands of
   P. australis and then monitored the performance of P. australis: (1)
   wrack was either removed or not removed for two growing seasons from
   areas where wrack had naturally stranded adjacent to stands of P.
   australis, and (2) wrack was either added or not added next to stands of
   P. australis without naturally stranded wrack for one growing season,
   and then the added wrack was removed before the next growing season.
   Removing naturally stranded wrack resulted in a substantial increase in
   the density of shoots of P. australis compared to areas with wrack.
   Similarly, areas where wrack was added for one growing season and then
   removed before the emergence of shoots in the next, had more than double
   the density of shoots compared to areas of natural marsh turf that did
   not undergo this disturbance. Moreover, these shoots were significantly
   taller and produced more inflorescences. Therefore, wrack stranded in
   the marsh can suppress the vegetative growth of P. australis, but once
   it decomposes or is removed by the tides, P. australis spreads
   dramatically. Wrack appears to facilitate the spread of P. australis by
   smothering the underlying marsh turf, creating patches of bare space
   with environmental conditions favourable to the spread of P. australis.
   The only areas where P. australis did not increase substantially were
   those continually occupied by marsh turf, indicating that undisturbed
   marsh turf is an important buffer resisting the local spread by P.
   australis. Because P. australis is currently spreading and the litter of
   P. australis contributes to the biomass of wrack, disturbance by wrack
   may be an increasingly important factor facilitating the spread of P.
   australis and influencing the ecology of coastal marshes. (C) 2002

   development anomalies. With this in mind, accuracy of direction of gaze
   detection was investigated in women with Turner syndrome. Two simple
   experimental tasks were used to test the prediction that the ability to
   ascertain gaze direction from face photographs showing small lateral
   angular gaze deviations would be impaired in this syndrome, compared
   with a control population of men and women. The prediction was confirmed
   and was found to affect both the detection of egocentric gaze from the
   eyes ('is the face looking at me?') and the detection of allocentric
   gaze, where the eyes in a photographed face inspected one of a number of
   locations of attention ('where is she looking?'). We suggest that
   dosage-sensitive X-linked genes contribute to the development of
   gaze-monitoring abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Year-round monitoring of five Antarctic pinnipeds was conducted in
   Admiralty Bay from 1988 up to 2000. Two breeding species: southern
   elephant seals Mirounga leonina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Weddell seals
   Leptonychotes weddellii (Lesson, 1826), were present throughout the
   year, Three other species: crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus (Hobron
   and Jacquinot, 1842), leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx (Blainville,
   1820), and Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875)
   visited the area only for short periods. During this study, the
   abundance of elephant seals was stable, whereas those of Weddell and
   crabeater seals declined. Leopard seals numbers fluctuated irregularly.
   We detected a possible immigration from South Georgia: of a stable
   magnitude for elephant seals, and of variable magnitude, depending on
   food accessibility, for Antarctic fur seals. We found a strong
   recurrence of the spatial distributions of elephant, Weddell, and
   Antarctic fur seals in the 13 oases on the shore of Admiralty Bay.
   Annual distribution patterns were characteristic for each species. The
   innermost beaches were used predominantly by the animals during their
   annual fasts: the breeding and the moulting seasons.}},

Abstract = {{The Drakensberg escarpment in southern Africa is extensively afforested
   with pine plantations. The Afromontane grasslands in this area have
   large numbers of endemic plant taxa, but very little is known of their
   invertebrate fauna. We report on the microgeographical and broadscale
   geographical characteristics of grasshoppers and their allies
   (Orthoptera) at the Groenvaly grassland fragmentation experiment site,
   South Africa. Pre-fragmentation sampling indicates that control sites
   and experimental fragments were comparable at the start of the
   experiment. Of the surveyed species (total 31 species) 25\% are endemic
   to this grassland with another 33\% occuring more widely in montane
   grasslands of southeastern South Africa. The level of orthopteran
   endemicity is therefore similar to that of plants, emphasizing the
   conservation importance of this threatened habitat. There was a
   significant inverse relation between the degree of stenotopy of a
   species within the study site and its geographical range in southern
   Africa, with implications for interpreting the conservation importance
   of taxonomically and geographically unknown taxa such as the beetles
   (Coleoptera) in the Afromontane grassland. This information on
   endemicity of the Afromontane Orthoptera indicates that these grasslands
   harbour a diverse endemic fauna representing a significant part of
   southern African biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of foliar insect pests and natural enemies were monitored in
   vegetable production systems incorporating varying degrees of
   sustainable practices in Fletcher, NC, USA. Two types of tillage
   (conventional plow and disk, strip-tillage), two input approaches
   (chemically-based, biologically-based) and two cropping schedules
   (continuous tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), 3-year rotation of
   corn (Zea mays L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and tomato) were
   employed from 1995 to 1998. Tomato pest pressure was relatively low in
   all years, resulting in a limited impact of production systems on potato
   aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) (Homoptera: Aphididae), and its
   associated parasitoids and predators. Thrips (Frankliniella spp.
   (Thysanoptera)) populations were significantly higher in the biological
   input treatments in 3 of 4 years. Lepidopterous (primarily Helicoverpa
   zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)) damage on tomato was significantly
   higher in biological treatments in all years, damage by thrips and
   pentatomids (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) increasing each year in the
   continuous tomato crop schedule. Most insect populations were
   significantly influenced by type of insecticide input or ground cover.
   Few population measurements were affected by tillage type. Foliar insect
   problems in commercial vegetable production may be associated
   predominantly with insecticide input (i.e. more damage with biologically
   based insecticides) and use of intercropping (i.e. more damage in
   systems with living mulch); however, the long term effects of tillage
   and crop rotation remain to be seen. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Populations of epigeal arthropods were monitored in vegetable production
   systems under varying degrees of sustainable agricultural practices in
   Fletcher, NC (USA). Two tillage types (conventional plow and disk,
   strip-tillage (ST)), two input approaches (chemically based,
   biologically based) and two cropping schedules (continuous tomato
   Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., 3-year rotation of sweet corn {[}Zea mays
   L.]/cabbage {[}Brassica oleracea L.], cucumber {[}Cucumis sativus
   L.]/cabbage and tomato) were employed from 1995-1998. A second study
   with tomatoes was performed in 1997-1998 to separate effects of
   pesticide use, intercropping and herbicide application. Pitfall traps
   (48-h sample period) were used at similar to25-day intervals to monitor
   relative activity of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae),
   staphylinid (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) beetles and lycosid spiders
   (Araneidae: Lycosidae). Carabids and lycosids appeared to be more active
   in systems with ground cover. Trap catches of carabid species were not
   significantly affected by insecticide input, but trap catches of
   lycosids were lower in plots with conventional insecticide use. No
   consistent effect of tillage was found over time, although Scarites spp.
   were more active in minimally disturbed habitats in 1998. Two distinct
   patterns of seasonal activity were observed for carabid beetles and
   lycosid spiders. Ground cover generally enhanced abundance of carabids
   and lycosids, while tillage type, pesticide use and crop rotation had
   different effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A large-scale experiment on maize storage systems was carried out in
   Atakpame (Plateaux region of Togo), between autumn 1996 and spring 1997.
   An integrated pest management (IPM) approach based on research findings
   at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and
   intended to control insect pests in rural maize stores was compared with
   (1) the locally prevalent methods of storage of farmers from the
   Plateaux region and (2) with the storage system recommended by the
   National Plant Protection Service in Togo (SPV). Two storage systems
   were designed based on IPM principles, one using a local variety (chosen
   mainly for its excellent husk cover characteristics), the second
   including an improved variety (with higher yield and moderately good
   husk cover characteristics), and both depending on visual selection of
   cobs at harvest to reduce initial insect infestation. The experiment was
   conducted in a collaborative manner, including representatives of the
   SPV, farmers from the Plateaux region, and researchers from IITA.
   Population dynamics of major insects and associated losses to stored
   maize were monitored monthly over an 8-month period, while an on-site
   evaluation of pest infestation and losses was conducted after 6 and 8
   months of storage. The performance of the different storage systems was
   evaluated in terms of pest densities, grain weight losses and
   cost-efficiency. The IPM-based systems were as effective as the
   pesticide-based SPV system in reducing infestation and grain losses.
   When only the incremental net returns from the storage practices were
   considered, both the IPM approach and the recommendations of the SPV
   performed better than the farmers' methods of storage. However, when the
   yields (per hectare) of the different maize varieties used in the
   respective storage systems were included in the cost and return
   analysis, the IPM storage systems using the local variety performed
   worse. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring populations of pests and their natural enemies under
   different management situations and seasonal weather parameters provides
   extremely useful information for taking preventive measures against pest
   outbreaks. The abundance, spatial and temporal distributions of
   herbivorous insects and arthropod natural enemies on Alnus species were
   monitored at four sites in Kabale district, Uganda between June 1999 and
   August 2000. Chewing insects, dominated by Coleoptera (75\%),
   constituted the majority of insect herbivores sampled. Dominant and
   potentially serious pests of Alnus included Apion globulipenne, an
   unidentified Chrysomelidae (Coleopt. 27), Phymateus viridipes,
   Coloborrtics corticina and a Cacopsylla species (Homoptera: Psyllidae).
   Spiders were the predominant natural enemies accounting for 64\% of the
   total natural enemies encountered, followed by parasitic Hymenoptera
   (30\%). There were marked spatial and temporal variations in arthropod
   abundance. Among sites, mean abundance of total insect herbivores and
   total natural enemies on A. acuminata over 15 months ranged from 3.8-8.5
   and 3.3-4.7 individuals per 1-m branch length respectively. Over the
   same period, mean number of total insect herbivores and total natural

Abstract = {{Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of the southern Beaufort Sea population,
   distributed from approximately Icy Cape, west of Point Barrow, Alaska,
   to Pearce Point, east of Paulatuk in Canada, are harvested by hunters
   from both countries. In Canada, quotas to control polar bear hunting
   have been in place, with periodic modifications, since 1968. In Alaska,
   passage of the United States Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972
   banned polarbear hunting unless done by Alaska Natives for subsistence.
   However, the MMPA placed no restrictions on numbers or composition of
   the subsistence hunt, leaving open the potential for an overharvest with
   no possible legal management response until the population was declared
   depleted. Recognizing that as a threat to the conservation of the shared
   polar bear population, the Inuvialuit Game Council from Canada and the
   North Slope Borough from Alaska negotiated and signed a user-to-user
   agreement, the Polar Bear Management Agreement for the Southern Beaufort
   Sea, in 1988. We reviewed the functioning of the agreement through its
   first 10 years and concluded that, overall, it has been successful
   because both the total harvest and the proportion of females in the
   harvest have been contained within sustainable limits. However, harvest
   monitoring needs to be improved in Alaska, and awareness of the need to
   prevent overharvest of females needs to be increased in both countries.
   This agreement is a useful model for other user-to-user conservation
   agreements.}},

Abstract = {{The species composition, relative abundance, and seasonal dynamics of
   selected natural enemies of cereal aphids were monitored in spring wheat
   fields in Moscow, Idaho in 1997 and 1998. Trials also examined the
   potential impact of resistance to Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis
   noxia (Mordvilko) (Homoptera: Aphididae) in wheat, on aphid biological
   control agents. Natural enemy populations were monitored on two spring
   wheats: D. noxia susceptible variety `Centennial' and resistant genotype
   `IDO488'. Field plots were artificially infested with adult D. noxia,
   and sampled for cereal aphids and parasitoids weekly. Coccinellid
   predators were monitored once in 1997 and twice in 1998. The
   coccinellids Hippodamia convergens Guerin, Coccinella septempunctata L.,
   C. transversoguttata Brown and C. trifasciata Mulsant were detected. No
   significant differences in adult or immature coccinellid densities were
   observed between the D. noxia resistant and susceptible genotypes.
   During both years, the most abundant primary hymenopteran parasitoids
   were Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh), Aphidius ervi Haliday, A. avenaphis
   (Fitch), and Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson), Aphelinus varipes
   (Foerster), Aphidius colemani Viereck, Aphidius picipes (Nees), Aphidius
   sp., Monoctonus washingtonensis Pike \& Stary, Praon gallicum Stary,
   Praon occidentale Baker, and Praon sp. were also detected. Numbers of
   both D. noxia and D. rapae were significantly greater on Centennial than
   on IDO488 in both years. When all species of cereal aphids and
   parasitoids are considered, the total percentage parasitism was not
   significantly different between the genotypes. There was no interaction
   between D. noxia resistance and the population density of the predators
   or parasitoids monitored. These results suggest that the D. noxia
   resistant line had no adverse impact on natural enemies under the
   conditions of these field experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Concern has been expressed over the status of the bottlenose dolphin
   population that uses the Moray Firth and adjacent waters in NE Scotland.
   Consequently, part of this population's range has been proposed as a
   Special Area of Conservation. Efforts to manage and monitor the status
   of this population require information on the level of genetic diversity
   within the population and its genetic relatedness to neighbouring
   populations to appropriately designate units for management and
   monitoring. Here we examine mitochondrial genetic diversity within the
   NE Scotland population, and compare this to other regions around the UK
   and Ireland. Sequence analysis of 549bp of the mitochondrial DNA control
   region identified eight unique haplotypes in a sample of 29 individuals.
   Analysis of molecular variance suggests that the Moray Firth population
   is genetically more closely related to Welsh animals than to its nearest
   neighbour population in west Scotland. Furthermore, measures of
   within-population genetic diversity were markedly lower in the Moray
   Firth than any other sampled region. The low levels of mtDNA genetic
   variability observed and its apparent geographic isolation provide
   further support for the precautionary approach currently being applied
   to the management of this population, despite the lack of direct
   evidence of harm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of remnant populations of white-upped peccaries in
   Central America depends on adequate documentation of their habitat needs
   and behavior. Thus, we monitored the activity patterns, local
   distributions, and home ranges of 36 (25F:11M) radio-marked white-lipped
   peccaries, all members of a single ``super{''} herd, in part of
   Corcovado National Park, their largest stronghold in Costa Rica, during
   1996 1998. Peccaries were diurnal all year with a period of reduced
   activity during the middle of the day. They were found more often than
   expected (vs. random use) in primary forest during February to May, in
   secondary and coastal forest during June to September, and in herbaceous
   swamp during October to January, corresponding to relative fruit
   abundance. Overall, the peccary herd ranged over an area of <40 km(2),
   but use of the area shifted seasonally and movements were reduced when
   fruit was most abundant. Our data agree with the suggestion that peccary
   density may be higher where the interspersion or close proximity and mix
   of seasonally important habitats is high, and thus where peccaries do
   not have to travel as far for food. Habitat interspersion is therefore a
   significant conservation concern and should be addressed to make certain
   that peccary populations are not limited. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Various insecticide use strategies including rotations, sequential use,
   and mixtures were evaluated experimentally on Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)
   in California and Arizona (USA) cotton fields. Toxicological responses
   of adult B. tabaci were measured along with preimaginal densities and
   cotton yields from plots subjected to different insecticide regimens.
   Weekly monitoring for susceptibility changes over ten consecutive weeks
   in four different trials failed to detect significant differences
   between sequential use and rotation regimens, nor in comparison to the
   control plots. There were, however, significant differences among
   study-site locations and between study years as well as significant
   within-season time effects. Relative infestations in insecticide-treated
   plots expressed as a percentage of preimaginal densities in control
   plots indicated that better control was obtained by all insecticide
   treatments in conjunction with higher susceptibility levels observed in
   the second year. Lower preimaginal densities of B. tabaci were measured
   in the rotation treatment in comparison to sequential treatments of
   endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, or amitraz, but all were less effective than
   sequential treatments of bifenthrin or the mixture of bifenthrin +
   endosulfan. Cotton lint yields were inversely related to B. tabaci
   densities, with highest yields in the bifenthrin and mixture plots and
   lowest yields in the control plots. Suppression of B. tabaci
   infestations in insecticide-treated plots relative to untreated control
   plots also improved under conditions of lower B. tabaci pressure. The
   increases in cotton yield and susceptibility to insecticides seen in the
   current study support the trend observed in the southwestern USA of
   improved management of B. tabaci despite continuing intensive use of
   insecticides.}},

Abstract = {{Big Creek Marine Ecological Reserve (BCER), located off the central
   California coast, has been closed to fishing since January 1994. We used
   side scan sonar and an occupied submersible to collect baseline
   information on species-habitat relationships, density, and species and
   size composition of fish inside and outside BCER. Forty-three dives were
   made in the fall of 1997 and 1998, at depths of 20-250 m. From 142 video
   transects, we identified over 70,000 fish from 82 taxa, including 36
   species of rockfish. About 93\% of the 25,159 fish inside BCER were
   rockfishes representing at least 20 species. Young-of-the-year
   rockfishes dominated rock outcrops in 20-90 m depth inside and outside
   BCER. Four distinct fish assemblages were associated with (1) fine,
   smooth sediment in deep water; (2) bedrock with uneven surface in deep
   water; (3) sand waves and shell hash in shallow water; and (4) boulders
   and organic habitats on rock in shallow water. There were no significant
   differences in fish density among locations (inside and outside BCER)
   and depths or between years. Density was significantly higher in
   high-relief rock habitat than in low-relief soft and mixed sediments,
   regardless of location. There were no consistent patterns of larger fish
   inside compared to outside the protected area. We recommend development
   of a monitoring program to continue these surveys after increased time
   of protection and with increased assessment effort in the appropriate
   habitats of economically valuable species. In addition, extending the
   boundaries of BCER seaward would protect habitats and fish in water
   depths greater than 100 m.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the utility of short visits to seabird colonies to gauge
   nestling growth performance and diet, in 4 consecutive years (1995-1998)
   we measured nestling development and diet of Rhinoceros Auklets
   (Cerorhinca monocerata) at three colonies in British Columbia: Seabird
   Rocks, Triangle Island, and SGaang Gwaii (Anthony Island). In all years,
   nestlings of a given wing length on Triangle Island were significantly
   smaller than those on Seabird Rocks or SGaang Gwaii. Meals were also
   significantly lighter on Triangle Island than on Seabird Rocks or SGaang
   Gwaii; meals on the latter two islands were indistinguishable in mass.
   Retarded nestling development and small meal size on Triangle Island
   likely reflect the large contribution of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) to
   nestling diet on that colony alone. The intercolony differences in
   nestling performance appear to reflect the strong influence of local
   fish prey populations. Nonetheless, a united decline in performance in
   1996 and subsequent increase on all colonies suggest the influence of
   large-scale ocean climate phenomena on our entire study region and
   beyond. We did not, however, observe noticeable effects of the 1997-1998
   El Nino Southern Oscillation event on nestling growth performance or
   diet. We discuss the utility of our short-visit techniques for
   seabird-monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript we describe various alternative tools to estimate
   exposure to particles. We stress methods that are cost effective and
   widely available to those throughout the world. The use of surrogate
   measures arises from the need to estimate exposures of large populations
   where individual measurements are not feasible, for predictive modeling
   or to assess exposures rapidly before personal monitoring campaigns can
   be implemented. In addition, an understanding of the relationship
   between exposures and surrogate variables can be useful in helping to
   identify mitigation strategies to reduce exposures. We have separated
   the various alternative exposure measures by the scales of impact,
   describing approaches to assess regional, urban and household indoor air
   quality. In particular, we emphasize scenarios that are relevant to
   particle exposures that may be experienced in developing countries as a
   result of domestic energy use for cooking and heating. In all cases the
   approaches we describe are applicable to large populations as the data
   collection techniques are relatively inexpensive and specifically
   applicable on a population basis for risk assessment, epidemiology or to
   evaluate determinants of exposure and health outcomes. The ultimate use
   of the assessed exposures will determine the relevance of potential
   surrogate measures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was performed to evaluate the possibility of cocomposting
   wet husk and wastewater, the two main olive oil mill by-products. The
   pH, E.C., total C and N, humic substances, phenolics, volatile acids,
   lipids, P and K plus yeast, fungi, heterotrophic-, cellulolytic- and
   nitrifying bacteria and phyto toxicological parameters were monitored
   during a 120-day stabilization process. Performances of the composting
   system adopted, together with physicochemical characteristics of
   starting material and final product, are reported. Composting was found
   to induce a high level of organic matter change, with decrease of
   organic carbon, total nitrogen and C/N ratio, as well as of the easily
   biodegradable lipids. Good metabolic activity of the microbiological
   population, with the exception of the nitrifying bacteria, and a
   complete detoxification of starting material were also observed. The
   results obtained suggested that composting might be an adequate low-cost
   strategy for the recycling of olive oil by-products.}},

Abstract = {{A large decline in population size is sometimes considered sufficient
   indication that a species merits conservation interest. One organization
   categorizes as critically endangered any species whose populations
   decline by 80\% over 10 years, whereas others assign importance to
   species declining 50\% over 25 years. Using these and additional
   conservation-alert categories, I determined how many of over 200 bird
   species that breed in Canada qualified for each category, based on
   population trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The
   majority of qualifying species were not candidates for immediate
   intervention to halt or reverse declines. Moreover, species assigned to
   alert categories based on 5- and 10-year trends for past time periods
   frequently had positive trends in the subsequent decade. Results
   indicate that population decline should not be used to identify species
   at risk or as a basis for conservation action without detailed
   evaluation of the trend data and other characteristics of the species.
   However, assigning species to alert categories is a useful step in
   identifying species that may deserve conservation attention of some kind
   ( including better monitoring and research as well as direct
   intervention). Evaluation of trend quality and persistence is an
   important step in determining the most appropriate action. Deciding when
   to recommend intervention will be the most problematic for species that
   are still relatively common and widespread, and there is a need for
   development of species-specific population thresholds that would be
   appropriate for triggering such action.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite their important roles in biodiversity conservation, large-scale
   ecological monitoring programs are scarce, in large part due to the
   difficulty of achieving an effective design under fiscal constraints.
   Using long-term avian monitoring in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada
   as an example, we present a methodology that uses power analysis,
   statistical modeling, and partial derivatives to identify cost-effective
   sampling strategies for ecological monitoring programs. Empirical
   parameter estimates were used in simulations that estimated the power of
   sampling designs to detect trend in a variety of species' populations
   and community metrics. The ability to detect trend with increased sample
   effort depended on the monitoring target's variability and how effort
   was allocated to sampling parameters. Power estimates were used to
   develop nonlinear models of the relationship between sample effort and
   power. A cost model was also developed, and partial derivatives of the
   power and cost models were evaluated to identify two cost-effective
   avian sampling strategies. For decreasing sample error, sampling
   multiple plots at a site is preferable to multiple within-year visits to
   the site, and many sites should be sampled relatively infrequently
   rather than sampling few sites frequently, although the importance of
   frequent sampling increases for variable targets. We end by stressing
   the need for long-term, spatially extensive data for additional taxa,
   and by introducing optimal design as an alternative to power analysis
   for the evaluation of ecological monitoring program designs.}},

Abstract = {{Genes that spread from transgenic crops to populations of weedy
   relatives can be a cause of concern if fitness-related, transgenic
   traits persist and enhance weed invasiveness. Studies of the prevalence
   of crop-specific genetic markers in wild populations can provide data on
   such introgression. We conducted a field experiment in eastern Kansas to
   measure changes in frequencies of crop-specific genetic markers in wild
   sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Three allozyme markers were monitored in
   three artificial populations that each initially consisted of 100 wild
   and 100 F, hybrid plants. Survival, flowering time, and average seed
   production per plant were quantified during the first year of the study
   (1997). Hybrid plants produced only 1-2\% as many seeds per plant as
   wild plants but did not differ in survivorship. Simple selection models
   incorporating fecundity differences between wild and F, hybrids
   accurately predicted crop allele frequencies in the 1998 seedlings. We
   predicted that frequencies of crop alleles in 1998 would average similar
   to0.03 for the three populations. Crop-specific allele frequencies
   dropped from the initial level of 0.25 to a mean of 0.03 in the 1998
   seedlings and averaged 0.05 in the next generation of seeds. Accounting
   for differences in flowering phenology and predispersal seed predation
   did not improve the accuracy of our predictions for 1998 seedlings. Our
   results suggest that ecological data can be useful for estimating the
   frequencies of crop genes following episodes of crop-wild hybridization
   in sunflowers. This approach can be applied to other study systems in
   which data on survivorship and fecundity are used to estimate a
   genotype's evolutionary fitness.}},

Abstract = {{1. The high-altitude wind-borne migration of the diamondback moth
   Plutella xylostella in the U.K. in 2000 was investigated (a) by direct
   monitoring of insect flight by vertical-looking radar and by aerial
   netting, and (b) through evidence of temporal variation in P. xylostella
   abundance deduced from a network of light traps.
   2. Migrating P. xylostella were identified by a unique combination of
   size and shape data derived from the continuously operating
   vertical-looking radar.
   3. Radar-detected migratory overflights correlated significantly with
   associated peaks in abundance of P. xylostella estimated by catches in a
   U.K.-wide light trap network; however the correlation was stronger when
   light trap catches were lagged by 1 day.
   4. The first notable catches of P. xylostella in the U.K. occurred in
   early May, and were accompanied by migrations over the radar from the
   east.
   5. Radar data and back-tracking indicated that a major wind-borne
   migration of P. xylostella from The Netherlands to southern England took
   place in early May, and that this was responsible for the establishment
   of the U.K. population.
   6. The origin of early-season P. xylostella occurring in Britain is
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Do alternate stable community states exist in the Gulf of Maine rocky

Abstract = {{It has recently been hypothesized that intertidal mussel beds and
   seaweed canopies in the Gulf of Maine are alternate community stable
   states or disturbance patch mosaics dominated by either seaweed or
   mussel communities. The community that occurs in a given site is
   proposed to be stochastic and dependent on the size of the original
   disturbance and subsequent recruit availability. Large disturbances are
   postulated to be dominated by mussel beds and barnacles with widely
   dispersed larvae, whereas smaller disturbances are dominated by
   seaweeds, with limited dispersal. Positive feedbacks are proposed to
   maintain these two communities.
   We tested this hypothesis in a tidal estuary in central Maine. At eight
   mussel bed and eight seaweed canopy sites, we created 9-m(2) and 1-m(2)
   clearings and an unmanipulated control area, and in each plot
   established control, caged, and cage control quadrats. After three years
   of monitoring, our results do not support the alternate stable state
   hypothesis. Instead, they suggest that the occurrence of mussel beds and
   seaweed canopies is highly deterministic. Seaweed canopies dominate
   habitats with relatively little water movement, whereas mussel beds
   dominate habitats with high flows; and largely independent of
   disturbance size, mussel beds and seaweed canopies rapidly returned to
   their original community type, but only in the absence of consumers
   (crabs and snails). With consumers present, neither community showed
   significant signs of recovery, even after three years. In the presence
   of consumers, community recovery appears to be dependent on cracks and
   crevices providing refuges from consumers to seaweed and mussel
   recruits.
   The idea that natural communities may represent stochastically
   determined alternate stable states has important implications for
   understanding and managing natural ecosystems, but the very existence of
   alternate stable states in nature has been difficult to establish. Our
   results suggest that intertidal seaweed canopies and mussel beds in
   tidal rivers in the Gulf of Maine are highly deterministic alternative
   community states under consumer control. More generally, since all
   proposed examples of alternate community stable states are based on
   indirect, inferential evidence, our results imply that stochastically
   determined alternate community stable states might be an interesting
   theoretical idea without a definitive empirical example.}},

Abstract = {{The relative impacts of intrinsic factors (e.g., density dependence) and
   extrinsic factors (e.g., climate) on winter demography may be critical
   for the generation of different population dynamic patterns (including
   cyclicity) in northern vole and lemming populations. However, little is
   known about winter demography because studies with temporal and spatial
   replication at the population level and an adequate sample of
   individuals with known fates, within each population are rare. In this
   study, we monitored the winter demography of 48 local tundra vole
   populations introduced to experimentally enclosed plots the preceding
   spring for four years in Norway.
   The rate of population change over the winter (November-May) was density
   dependent due to recruitment. However, the large variation in the rate
   of change between the different winters was due to a
   density-independent, and most likely a climatically driven, variation in
   survival rate. In particular, mild weather that led to the formation of
   ice on the ground. seemed to be detrimental for winter survival. We
   predict that if increased frequency of such events arose, due to climate
   change, normal cyclic dynamics of northern small rodent populations
   would be disrupted.
   We found support for the hypothesis that voles adjusted their body mass
   toward a certain mean during the winter so as to maximize winter
   survival. The survival rate of males was lower than that of females,
   possibly due to their larger body mass, and this resulted in
   female-biased-population sex ratios in the spring. This result suggests
   a link between sexual selection (responsible for the sexual size
   dimorphism) and natural selection (operating though size-dependent
   winter survival) with implications for the demographic structure of the
   population.}},

Abstract = {{As far as the impact of air pollutants on human heath being is
   concerned, ozone (03) is one of the most pollutant sources, and, in
   particular, the ground level ozone is responsible for a variety of
   adverse effects on both human being and plant life. To protect the
   population from such adverse health effects, early information and
   precautions about the high ozone level need to be ascertained. In this
   study, statistical characteristics of ground level ozone is analyzed
   according to field monitoring data in mixed residential, commercial and
   industrial areas, e.g., Tsuen Wan area in Hong Kong. The study deals
   with the characteristics of hourly and daily mean ozone levels under
   different climatic conditions such as temperature, solar radiation (SR),
   wind speed (WS), and other pollutant concentration levels. The study
   aims to investigate the importance of meteorological factors and their
   impact on relevant pollutant concentration levels from a chemical
   aspect. Further, reasons for the spatial and temporal variation of ozone
   levels are discussed. All these results will provide a physical basis
   for accurately predicting ozone concentration in similar research. (C)

Abstract = {{Traps baited with the synthetic aggregation pheromone of the boll weevil
   (Anthonomus grandis Boheman) are often used to monitor population
   fluctuations, distribution, and behavior. However, many factors generate
   variability in daily captures, making interpretation of trapping data
   difficult. Previous studies have shown that wind speed in the
   microenvironment around a trap can greatly affect numbers captured on a
   given day. It is possible that variation in air movement may also
   generate variation in trap captures through its effects on the pheromone
   plume. The current study was conducted to determine whether five traps
   placed in a line at two commonly used spacings (15 and 20 m) interfere
   with one another. There was no evidence for interference on days when
   winds struck the trap line at a nearly perpendicular angle. However, for
   both spacings, there were significant and substantial effects of
   relative trap placement within a line on days when winds struck it at an
   angle (>22.5degrees) away from the perpendicular. The largest and most
   consistent effect was that the trap furthest upwind in the line captured
   the most weevils, especially on days of moderate wind speeds (10-20
   km/h). The upwind trap captured 1.5-2.0 times as many weevils as the
   next trap in the line, which usually had the lowest percentage of
   capture of any of the traps. Until the minimum adequate spacing has been
   established, traps should be placed at least 30 m apart in experiments
   in which such biases can adversly affect interpretation of results.}},

Abstract = {{monitored egg parasitism and larval populations of Pieris rapae (L.) and

   broadcast releases of Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko, and we
   investigated whether weekly sugar sprays improved egg parasitism rates.
   We also compared yield and pest densities in cabbage treated with
   Bacillus thuringiensis (Dipel), methomyl (Lannate), or point releases of
   T brassicae to an untreated control, and investigated the economics of
   these control strategies. Egg parasitism was highest in the point
   release treatment (46\%), and parasitism in the broadcast and the
   broadcast + sugar spray treatments (31 and 24\%, respectively) did not
   differ from the control. Weekly applications of sucrose did not increase
   egg parasitism or decrease larval pest populations. Releases of T
   brassicae did not significantly reduce P. rapae and T ni larval
   populations, and plant damage and cabbage head weight were unaffected in
   the T brassicae treatments relative to the control. In addition, the
   cost of applying the T brassicae wasps was not recouped with significant
   yield improvements relative to the control. Methomyl and Bt consistently
   suppressed P. rapae and T ni populations below action thresholds in a

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to monitor tobacco thrips populations
   during the early spring in Georgia and to determine the role of
   brachypterous tobacco thrips in epidemics of tomato spotted wilt virus
   (TSWV). Potted peanuts were placed into fields at four locations in
   south Georgia throughout the spring of 2000 and 2001. During March 2001,
   half of all potted peanuts were covered with exclusion/inclusion cages.
   Tobacco thrips were collected from terminals and flowers on a weekly
   basis and were identified as macropterous or brachypterous.
   Nonstructural protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
   performed on individual thrips to determine the proportion of
   brachypterous and macropterous viruliferous thrips in the population.
   Macropterous thrips were more abundant than brachypterous thrips, except
   at the Coffee County location during late February and early March.
   Peaks in thrips abundance and percentage of viruliferous thrips shifted
   approximately 2 wk later for 2001 than for 2000 at the Tift County
   location. In laboratory transmission experiments, no difference was
   found in,the ability to transmit TSWV for the two wing morphs.
   Macropterous thrips appear to be more capable of colonizing and
   subsequently transmitting TSWV to newly emerged crops. Therefore, it
   appears that brachypterous tobacco thrips may help to perpetuate the
   disease cycle of TSWV by harboring the virus over the winter, and by
   keeping inoculum in the population until temperatures rise and the
   percentage of macropterous thrips in the population increases.}},

Abstract = {{The midgut epithelium of aquatic arthropods is emerging as an important
   and toxicologically relevant organ system for monitoring environmental
   pollution. The peritrophic matrix of aquatic arthropods, which is
   secreted by the midgut epithelium cells, is perturbed by copper or
   cadmium. Molecular biological studies have identified and characterized
   two midgut genes induced by heavy metals in the midgut epithelium. Many
   other metal-responsive genes (MRGs) await characterization. One of the
   MRGs codes for an intestinal mucin, which is critical for protecting the
   midgut from toxins and pathogens. Another codes for a tubulin gene,
   which is critical for structure and function of the midgut epithelial
   cells. Perturbation of expression of either gene could condition aquatic
   arthropod survivorship. Induction of these MRGs is a more sensitive and
   rapid indicator of heavy-metal pollution than biological assays.
   Characterization of genes induced by pollutants could provide
   mechanistic understanding of fundamental cellular responses to
   pollutants and insight into determinants of aquatic arthropod population
   genetic structure and survivorship in nature.

Abstract = {{Soils co-contaminated with metals and organics present special problems
   for remediation. Metal contamination can delay or inhibit microbial
   degradation of organic pollutants such that for effective in situ
   biodegradation, bioaugmentation is necessary. We monitored the
   degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or
   3-chlorobenzoate (3-CB) in two different soils with and without cadmium
   (Cd) contamination. Additionally, we evaluated the ability of
   bioaugmentation to enhance organic degradation in these co-contaminated
   soils. Finally, we determined whether enhanced degradation was due to
   survival of the introduced organism (cell bioaugmentation) or plasmid
   transfer to indigenous microbial populations (gene bioaugmentation). In
   Brazito soil, dual inoculation with a Cd-resistant bacterium plus a
   known 2,4-D-degrading bacterium, Ralstonia eutropha JMP 134, enhanced
   2,4-D degradation. Escherichia coli D 11, which lacks chromosomal genes
   necessary for complete 2,4-D mineralization, was used for gene
   bioaugmentation in Madera soil. Significant gene transfer of the plasmid
   to the indigenous populations was observed, and the rate of 2,4-D
   degradation was enhanced relative to that of controls. Cell
   bioaugmentation was further demonstrated when Comamonas testosteroni was
   used to enhance biodegradation of 3-CB in Madera soil. In this case no
   transfer of plasmid pBRC60 to indigenous soil recipients was observed.
   For the Madera soil, nonbioaugmented samples ultimately showed complete
   2,4-D degradation. In contrast, nonbioaugmented Brazito soils showed
   incomplete 2,4-D degradation. These studies are unique in showing that
   both cell bioaugmentation and gene bioaugmentation can be effective in
   enhancing organic degradation in co-contaminated soils. Ultimately, the
   bioaugmentation strategy may depend on the degree of contamination and
   the time frame available for remediation.

Abstract = {{We assessed inhalation risks to California communities from airborne
   agricultural pesticides by probability distribution analysis using
   ambient air data provided by the California Air Resources Board and the
   California Department of Pesticide Regulation. The pesticides evaluated
   include chloropicrin, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, S,S,S-tributyl
   phosphorotrithioate, diazinon, 1,3-dichloropropene, dichlorvos (naled
   breakdown product), endosulfan, eptam, methidathion, methyl bromide,
   methyl isothiocyanate (MITC; metam sodium breakdown product), molinate,
   propargite, and simazine. Risks were estimated for the median and 75th
   and 95th percentiles of probability (50, 25, and 5\% of the exposed
   populations). Exposure estimates greater than or equal to noncancer
   reference values occurred for 50\% of the exposed populations (adults
   and children) for MITC subchronic and chronic exposures, methyl bromide
   subchronic exposures (year 2000 monitoring), and 1,3-dichloropropene
   subchronic exposures (1990 monitoring). Short-term chlorpyrifos exposure
   estimates exceeded the acute reference value for 50\% of children (not
   adults) in the exposed population. Noncancer risks were uniformly higher
   for children due to a proportionately greater inhalation rate-to-body
   weight ratio compared to adults and other factors. Target health effects
   of potential concern for these exposures include neurologic effects
   (methyl bromide and chlorpyrifos) and respiratory effects
   (1,3-dichloropropene and MITC). The lowest noncancer risks occurred for
   simazine and chlorothalonil. Lifetime cancer risks of one-in-a-million
   or greater were estimated for 50\% of the exposed population for
   1,3-dichloropropene (1990 monitoring) and 25\% of the exposed
   populations for methidathion and molinate. Pesticide vapor pressure was
   found to be a better predictor of inhalation risk compared to other
   methods of ranking pesticides as potential toxic air contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Because of concern for-heat-related mortality in vulnerable populations,
   particularly the elderly, practical epidemiologic methods are needed for
   the assessment of ambient heat exposure on individuals. We used a
   personal monitor to measure body temperature, ambient temperature, heart
   rate, and activity level of 42 elderly residents of Baltimore, Maryland,
   in the summer months of 2000. Each participant was monitored for
   approximately 48 hr to examine the association between ambient
   temperature and body temperature, using regression methods that account
   for highly correlated data within individuals. We also examined the
   associations of Baltimore temperature data with personal ambient
   temperature and body temperature. An average 0.15degreesF {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI), 0.05-0.25] increase in median body temperature
   was found for each 1degreesF increase in median ambient temperature.
   Heart rate and activity level were not found to be related to body
   temperature or ambient temperature, although heart rate was associated
   with activity level. Median heart rate increased an average of 0.17
   (95\% CI, 0.13-0.21) beats per minute for every unit increase in median
   activity level. Personal ambient temperature was slightly lower than
   Baltimore temperatures, whereas an association was not found between
   body temperature and Baltimore temperatures. The protocol established in
   this study for heat exposure assessment could feasibly be applied on a
   larger scale.}},

Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1261-1266}},

Abstract = {{A 28-year-old female presented for evaluation of left flank pain and
   polyuria after having been exposed to cadmium in the jewelry
   manufacturing industry for approximately 3 years. This patient possessed
   both elevated 24-hr urinary beta(2)-microglobulin and elevated blood
   cadmium levels. Approximately 6 months after initial presentation, the
   patient resigned from her job due to shortness of breath, chest pain,
   and anxiety. Exposure to cadmium in the jewelry industry is a
   significant source of occupational cadmium exposure. Other occupational
   sources include the manufacture of nickel-cadmium batteries, metal
   plating, zinc and lead refining, smelting of cadmium and lead, and
   production of plastics. Cadmium is also an environmental pollutant that
   accumulates in leafy vegetables and plants, including tobacco. Major
   toxicities anticipated from cadmium exposure involve the renal,
   pulmonary, and, to a lesser extent, gastrointestinal systems. These
   include the development of renal proximal tubular dysfunction,
   glomerular damage with progressive renal disease, and respiratory
   symptoms including pneumonitis and emphysema. Low-level cadmium exposure
   has also been associated with increased urinary calcium excretion and
   direct bone toxicity, effects that recent research suggests may result
   in the development of osteoporosis. The body burden of cadmium, over
   half of which may reside in the kidneys, is most often measured through
   the use of urinary cadmium levels. Blood cadmium measurements generally
   reflect current or recent exposure and are especially useful in cases
   with a short exposure period and only minimal accumulation of cadmium in
   the kidneys. Both beta(2)-microglobutin and alpha(1)-microglobulin serve
   as organ-specific, early-effect biomarkers of tubular proteinuria and
   thus play a role in identifying early signs of cadmium-induced renal
   damage in those with potential exposures. In addition to ensuring
   workplace compliance with Occupational Safety and Health
   Administration-mandated monitoring and screening measures, it is prudent
   for those with cadmium exposure to maintain adequate intake of both iron
   and calcium, appropriate measures even in the absence of exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The microalgal community as primary producers has to play a significant
   role in the biotic and abitoic interactions of any aquatic ecosystem.
   Whenever a community is exposed to a pollutant, responses can occur
   because individuals acclimate to pollutant caused changes and selection
   can occur favouring resistant genotypes within a population and
   selection among species can result in changes in community structure.
   The microalgal community of industrial effluent treatment systems are
   continuously exposed to pollutants and there is little data available on
   the structure and seasonal variation of microalgal community of
   industrial effluent holding ponds, especially of a complex effluent like
   that of refinery. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
   annual variation in the ecology, biomass, productivity and community
   structure of the algal community of a refinery effluent holding pond.
   The results of the study showed the pond to be a eutrophic system with a
   resistant microalgal community with distinct seasonal variation in
   species composition.}},

Abstract = {{An inventory of air pollution sources within the Athens basin is carried
   out for the years 1989, 1992 and 1998 and the results are inputted in a
   climatological model for predicting ambient concentrations. Despite of
   the significant growth in the number of road vehicles and the
   deteriorating traffic, the emissions and ambient concentrations of fine
   particulates, CO, NOx and VOC appear to remain reasonably constant over
   for the period 1989 to 1998, while these of SO2 and Pb are reduced,
   mainly due to the renewal of vehicle fleet, the use of catalytic
   technologies and the improved quality of the used fuel. The results
   further indicate that for CO, NOx and VOC the major source is road
   traffic, while for PM2.5 and SO2 both space heating and traffic share
   responsibility. The air pollutant concentrations monitored by the
   network of 11 stations are reviewed and statistics related to air
   quality guidelines are presented. As fine particulate levels are not
   monitored, approximate PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations are derived from
   black smoke ones on basis of experimentally determined conversion
   factors. The computed and monitored air pollution levels are compared
   and found in reasonable agreement. The results of the above analysis
   show that the levels of all `classical' pollutants, with the exception
   of SO2 and Pb, exceed significantly the WHO guidelines and are thus
   expected to exert a significant health impact. The latter could be
   quantified in relation to the PM2.5 or PM10 levels on the basis of risk
   assessment information developed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
   The results show that the existing levels of fine particle
   concentrations in Athens increase significantly the mortality and
   morbidity, and reduce the average longevity of the entire population
   from 1.3 to 1.7 years.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the concentrations of
   environmental contaminants in the edible portion of fish tissue consumed
   by Ojibwa residing in the Upper Great Lakes region. Lake trout,
   whitefish, and walleye were collected from Lake Superior, Lake Huron,
   Lake Michigan, and selected inland lakes. These fish were harvested by
   either commercial fishing or spearfishing techniques and analyzed for
   environmental contaminants. Samples were pooled by species and location
   of collection and were analyzed as composites. The concentrations of
   congener-specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), total mercury, and 17
   other organochlorine compounds of the pooled samples were determined
   using gas chromatographic and atomic absorption techniques. Differences
   were noted in both the concentration and composition of contaminants
   depending on the geographic location of collection and the species
   examined. Lake trout and whitefish contained higher concentrations of
   organochlorine compounds than did walleye; and samples from Lakes
   Michigan and Huron had much higher concentrations than did Lake Superior
   fish. Conversely, mercury was much higher in walleye (580 ppb) when
   compared with lake trout (117 ppb) and whitefish (10 ppb). Several PCB
   congeners were commonly found in all fish samples; these included PCBs
   138 + 163, 153, 66 + 95, 118, 77 + 110, 180, and 101. Lake trout
   accumulated the highly chlorinated PCB congeners, whereas walleye and
   whitefish accumulated certain lower tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyl
   congeners. In conclusion, the fish harvested and consumed by Ojibwa
   tribal members contained both mercury and organochlorine compounds. The
   concentrations of contaminants found in fish tissue differed among
   species and sampling sites. Consequently, it is imperative to sample
   fish that best represent those being consumed by tribal members and to
   continue long-term monitoring of fish from ceded waters. Therefore, risk
   assessment and risk management strategies need to take into account
   geographic location of the fish and unique preparation methods and to be
   directed at the contaminant(s) of concern for given locations. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Construction of two dams in 1958 and 1982 reduced freshwater inflow
   events to Rincon Bayou, part of the Nucces Delta near Corpus Christi,
   Texas, USA. Inflow reduction led to a reverse estuary, where
   low-salinity water flooded the delta on incoming tides and higher
   salinities were found near the Nueces River. Hypersaline conditions
   caused by high evaporation rates and low water levels were common during
   summer in the upper reaches. In October 1995, an overflow diversion
   channel was created by lowering the bank of the Nueces River to restore
   inflow events into Rincon Bayou, which is the main stem creek that runs
   through the center of the Delta. Hypersaline conditions occurred four
   times from mid-1994 to mid-1997 and only once after mid-1997. Lower,
   rather than higher, salinity conditions were found after August 1997 in
   the upper reaches. Benthic faunal recovery was monitored by changes in
   macrofauma and meiofauna communities. Macrofauna responded to inflow
   events with increased abundances, biomass, and diversity but decreased
   during hypersaline conditions. Meiofauna abundance also increased with
   increasing inflow. Benthic characteristics were different in Rincon
   Bayou than in a reference site, upstream from introduced inflow. As
   inflow events have increased due to the diversion, the opportunities for
   positive responses to increased flow have increased. Although the
   overflow channel was filled in at the end of the demonstration project
   in fall 2000, the City of Corpus Christi reopened the channel in fall
   2001 because the ecological benefits were credited toward the
   state-mandated minimum flow requirement for the Nueces Estuary.}},

Abstract = {{We amplified three kinds of cDNA fragments encoding stress proteins from
   the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis by polymerase chain reaction in order
   to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying mediation of its
   lifespan. The stress proteins were heat shock protein 70 (HSP70),
   glucose regulated protein 94 (GRP94) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme,
   which have been suggested to extend the lifespans of fruitfly and yeast.
   The isolated clones consisted of 579, 776 and 257bp in the above order,
   respectively, and their deduced amino acid sequences showed 81, 59 and
   48\% identities, respectively, with corresponding sequences from the
   nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. As rotifers in the stationary phase can
   extend their lifespan we subsequently performed northern blot analysis
   on rotifers both in the exponential and stationary phases. The mRNA
   levels of HSP70 and GRP94 in the exponential growth phase were 2.5 and
   1.6 times higher, respectively, than those in the stationary phase,
   whereas those of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme did not differ between
   rotifers in the two phases. These results suggest that stress proteins
   are not directly responsible for the extension of rotifer lifespan, but
   another factor(s) is possibly involved. Our results, however,
   demonstrated that these genes are useful as molecular markers for
   monitoring the population growth of rotifer.}},

Abstract = {{1. Piscivores (annual stocking of 1000 individuals ha(-1) of 0+ pike and
   a single stocking of 30 kg ha(-1) of large 20-30 cm perch) were stocked
   in seven consecutive years in a shallow eutrophic lake in Denmark. The
   stocking programme aimed at changing food-web structure by reducing
   zooplanktivorous and benthivorous fish, with resultant effects on lower
   trophic levels and ultimately water quality.
   2. The fish community and water quality parameters (Secchi depth,
   concentrations of total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and suspended solids)
   were monitored between 1996 and 2000 and relationships were evaluated
   between predatory fish and potential prey and between zooplanktivorous
   or benthivorous fish and water quality parameters. In addition,
   potential consumption of piscivorous fishes was calculated.
   3. The density of fish feeding on larger zooplankton or benthos (roach
   >15 cm, crucian carp >15 cm) declined distinctly during the study
   period. This effect was attributed to predation by large (>50 cm) pike.
   Based on scale readings, we cautiously suggest that the stocking of 0+
   pike boosted the adult pike population to produce an unexpected impact
   in later years. Conversely, no direct impact of stocked 0+ pike was
   detected on 0+ roach.
   4. A major decline in the recruitment strength of 0+ roach was observed
   in 2000. A combination of (i) the indirect effect of large pike preying
   on adult roach, with negative effect on roach reproduction and (ii) the
   direct predation effect of 0+ pike and or 1+ and 2+ perch recruited in
   the lake, provides the most likely explanation of this phenomenon.
   5. A marked increase in Secchi depth in 2000 and declining trends in
   suspended solids, chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations were
   observed. These changes may also be attributable to changes in the fish
   community, although the relationships were not straightforward.
   6. This 7-year study indicates that piscivorous fish may be a
   significant structuring force in shallow eutrophic lakes, suggesting
   that stocking piscivores can increase predation pressure on cyprinids.
   However, the general lack of impact of 0+ pike points to the need of
   refining current stocking practices in several countries across Europe.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of North Sea benthic invertebrate and fish communities is
   an important indicator of anthropogenic and environmental impacts.
   Although North Sea fish stocks are monitored regularly, benthic fauna
   are not. Here, we report the results of a survey carried out in 2000, in
   which five nations sampled the epibenthic and fish fauna at 270 stations
   throughout the North Sea. The aim of the survey was to investigate the
   diversity and community structure of epibenthic and fish communities and
   to identify relationships with environmental factors, including the
   frequency of commercial otter and beam trawling disturbance. Epibenthic
   species diversity was lower in the southern North Sea than in central
   and northern areas. Fish, conversely, were more diverse in the south.
   The 50 m, 100 m and 200 m depth contours broadly defined the boundaries
   of benthic and fish communities. The abundance of epibenthos of the
   southern North Sea was dominated by free-living species, whilst north of
   the 50 m contour sessile species prevailed. A hybrid area, with sessile
   species typical of the north and free-living species characteristic of
   the south, was found off the Norfolk and Flamborough coast stretching
   towards the Dogger Bank.
   Large-scale hydrodynamic phenomena were most likely to be responsible
   for the main divisions between communities, especially the boundary
   between mixed and stratified water masses. However, bottom temperature,
   sediment parameters and beam trawling were closely correlated with
   species richness and diversity, as well as community patterns, and may
   modify regional species composition.
   Our study shows that effective large-scale sampling of benthic
   communities can be conducted during existing fisheries surveys. Since
   annual fisheries surveys are conducted throughout the northeast Atlantic
   shelf seas, concurrent benthic surveys would allow benthic sampling on
   unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. The samples would help to
   monitor the environmental impacts of trawling disturbance, climate
   change, pollution and other natural and anthropogenic factors. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Toxicity levels of three insecticides, carbaryl, endosulfan and
   methomyl, were determined in populations of the pepper weevil Anthonomus
   eugenii. Insect populations were obtained front three locations in Baja
   California Sur, Mexico: Benito Juarez (27degrees53'N, 113degrees46'W),
   San Jose Viejo (23degrees07'N, 109degrees43'W), and San Juan de los
   Planes (23degrees58'N, 109degrees56'W). The highest LC50 values were
   found for carbaryl (178.4, 635.4 and 5462.1 mug/ml), endosulfan was
   intermediate (36.5, 34.1 and 47.1 mug/ml, respectively); and the lowest
   LC50 values corresponded to methomyl (1.3, 1.7 and 2.7 mug/ml), to
   Benito Juarez, San Jose Viejo and San Juan de los Planes, respectively.
   It is concluded can be inferred that pepper weevil populations in the
   farming zone of San Juan de los Planes are resistant to the three
   insecticides used, and are significantly more resistant to carbaryl,
   than are pepper, weevil populations in San Jose Viejo and Benito Juarez.
   Levels of insecticide susceptibility correspond to the amounts of
   insecticides used against the pepper weevil in the three locations, and
   are a response to the selective pressure exerted by those chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{This study used biomarker research in order to determine potential
   physiological effects of bioaccumulated metal and organochlorine
   compounds in juvenile and adult Kootenai River white sturgeon (
   Acipenser transmontanus). Wild adult and hatchery-reared and released
   juvenile sturgeon were captured using hook and line, small-mesh
   multi-lament gillnets, setlines and angling gear. Biomarker parameters
   that were assessed include whole-body tissue residues,
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), DNA
   chromosomal variability and liver histology in juveniles as well as
   ovarian tissue residues, plasma steroids, egg size and DNA chromosome
   variability in adults. Results from chemical residue analysis indicated
   that several metal and two organochlorine compounds were at levels that
   could potentially affect reproduction or other physiological functions
   in the sturgeon. The results also suggested a decrease in egg size and
   AChE levels as well as altered hormone production and increased genetic
   mutation due to bioaccumulated levels of the detected metal and
   organochlorine compounds. In conclusion, contaminants in the Kootenai
   River system are potentially creating additional stress ( perhaps in the
   form of diminished function) on the white sturgeon population. However,
   further research in the form of laboratory testing, in-situ studies and
   long-term trend monitoring will better de ne any relationships between
   bioaccumulation of environmental contaminants and the decline in the
   Kootenai River white sturgeon population.}},

Abstract = {{With fluctuating landings, Atlantic sturgeon ( Acipenser oxyrinchus
   oxyrinchus) have been commercially harvested for decades in the St
   Lawrence River Estuary in Canada. During this period, younger fishermen
   replaced their senior colleagues with more active fishing methods that
   must be considered in order to assess the situation of the Atlantic
   sturgeon. The species is sought for its flesh only, not for caviar (
   females with ripened eggs are rarely caught). At present, better
   management of this fishery is limited by the lack of basic knowledge on
   population dynamics ( e. g. mortality, recruitment, fecundity and
   spawning periodicity) and habitat requirements. The spawning grounds
   have yet to be identified and the impact of navigation channel dredging
   on fish habitat is unknown, but under study. The fishery is now strictly
   regulated and tends to protect the reproductive segment of the
   population. Regulatory measures have been progressively implemented to
   reduce mortality and limit fishing to a maximum of 60 metric tonnes.
   Regulatory measures include shorter seasons, a quota for each fishing
   zone, selected mesh size, identification and length limitations of the
   gill nets, a 150 cm fork length maximum size, and tagging and
   registration of all fish. Between 1994 and 2000, commercial fishing
   operations were monitored to measure the effectiveness of regulations.
   Length-frequencies have been evaluated and catch per unit effort
   calculated in addition to recording all other relevant observations
   possibly useful in interpreting results. Ages were assigned using the
   pectoral fin spine. Results show adult fish, especially males, ready for
   reproduction, but also an ageing sturgeon population with few recruits
   to sustain the future fishery, possibly a result of habitat problems and
   overfishing in recent years.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of river flows hampered natural reproduction of sturgeons
   in the Azov Sea basin. To develop a long-term strategy for stock
   enhancement, it is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the hatchery
   stocking programs. As a result of 60\% reduction in river flow, the
   natural propagation of sturgeon in the Kuban River has been absent for
   the past 25 years. Up to 30 million juveniles of Russian and stellate
   sturgeon were released annually from five sturgeon hatcheries, the main
   sources of sturgeon recruitment in the Sea of Azov. The hatchery
   stocking strategy was aimed solely at the release of a large number of
   juveniles, utilizing only the most mature broodfish of the spring
   spawning run for breeding. While the monitoring of age, weight and
   physiological conditions of the broodstock during the period of hatchery
   breeding did not reveal significant changes, the spawning run was
   dramatically shortened ( to 15 days, compared with several months in the
   previous history of the spawning run) and included only fish with
   advanced gonadal maturity. The analysis of protein polymorphism
   suggested significant changes in stock genetic composition of stellate
   sturgeon related to the hatchery practices and stocking allopatric
   populations from the Caspian Sea. The traditional methods and technology
   of the artificial reproduction appear to be ineffective under present
   ecological conditions. The different, long-term, management strategy
   should be based on new concepts of stock enhancement and genetic
   assessment, to preserve the intraspecific diversity of sturgeon. This
   includes novel hatchery methods for controlled maturation and spawning
   of different ecotypes, and production and stocking of high-quality
   juveniles in the year-round timetable. Conservation of the Azov Sea
   species and their unique spawning ecotypes is currently supported by the
   Federal Living Gene Bank in the Krasnodar Region, which maintains over
   7000 adults of the endangered species and populations. This genetic
   collection is used for research and restoration of the biodiversity of
   sturgeon in the Sea of Azov.}},

Abstract = {{Recovery of lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes basin is now a
   focus of binational, federal, provincial, state and tribal management
   agencies; however, efforts to restore and rehabilitate stocks will be
   ineffective until early life history strategies are understood. De ning
   the extent and duration of larval drift will help to protect and
   re-establish populations of lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens. The
   stages of early-life, from egg to about 250 mm total length (TL), are
   believed to be the most vulnerable to factors affecting survival. Drift
   of larvae was monitored during 8 of the 9 years between 1992 and 2000
   using drift nets set 14,26,35,45 and 61 km below the spawning site on
   the Sturgeon River, Michigan. Natural river water levels varied between
   years and influenced drift sampling and success of spawning and hatch.
   Between 1992 and 2000, total annual catch of drifting larval lake
   sturgeon varied from three to 423 individuals, with 978 larvae collected
   over the 8 years. Larvae drifted as a `plug' and became more dilute and
   spread out over time with distance downstream. This study has shown that
   (i) lake sturgeon larvae drift to 26 river kilometers (rkm) below the
   spawning site within 15 to 27 days after spawning and to 45 rkm within
   25 to 40 days after spawning; (ii) the average size of the larvae
   increases with distance downstream; (iii) drifting larvae are not
   distributed uniformly in space or time; (iv) two peaks in spawning were
   common and spawning seems to be related to the phase of the new moon in
   years without heavy spring flows; and ( v) that the lower river may be
   an important habitat for young-of-the-year sturgeons.}},

Abstract = {{The Gulf sturgeon ( Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) was listed as a
   threatened species in 1991 because of declines in abundance throughout
   the Gulf of Mexico. One recommendation of the recovery plan for Gulf
   sturgeon was to characterize critical habitats. In this study, radio
   telemetry was used to determine summer ( June August) distribution and
   habitat use of Gulf sturgeon in the Choctawhatchee River, Florida
   Alabama. Ranging from 74 to 222 cm total length, 63 radio-tagged fish
   were located 398 times during weekly or biweekly searches in June August
   of 1994-1997. A 10-km section of the lower Choctawhatchee River (river
   km 40-49.9) accounted for 38\% of the summer locations of immature fish
   ( less than 1.3 m fork length) and 73\% for mature fish. Fish were
   typically located at sites that were 2 5 m in depth, with water
   temperatures of 25-28 degreesC and a sand substrate. Spring discharges
   account for up to one-third of the mainstem river flow in this reach,
   but water temperatures at fish locations were similar to temperatures at
   fish locations in all other sections of the river. Efforts to monitor
   and improve habitat quality should be focussed on this river reach,
   given that a high percentage of the total Choctawhatchee River
   population occurs there during summer.}},

Abstract = {{In 1990 a conservation program began to evaluate the feasibility of
   using aquaculture to aid recovery of the white sturgeon population in
   the Kootenai River. Because of a virtual lack of recruitment during the
   past two decades, the population was formally listed in 1994 as
   endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act of 1973. Recovery
   program goals are to preserve the genetic variability of the population,
   rebuild natural age class structure, prevent extinction, and restore
   natural recruitment. Mature wild fish are captured prior to spawning and
   bred to produce four to 12 separate families per year of four to 10
   adults per family at breeding age. We released 2630 age 14 juvenile
   white sturgeon from 1992 to 999. Subsequent catches of 39 wild and 620
   hatchery juveniles in an annual monitoring program confirm that wild
   recruitment of Kootenai River white sturgeon is very low. Subsequent
   recaptures of hatchery fish indicate that significant numbers survived
   introduction and grew. Release recapture and catch curve analyses
   suggest that average annual survival rates for hatchery-reared juveniles
   may approach 60\% for the first year following release and 90\% in
   subsequent years. Growth rates and condition factors within 3 years
   after release were often poor as many hatchery fish adapted to natural
   conditions. Growth rates increased after the initial adjustment period.
   Average growth increments for all recaptured hatchery fish were 6.4 cm
   year(-1) and 0.206 kg year(-1). These rates are slightly less than the
   median rate reported for other white sturgeon populations. Growth varied
   substantially among individuals. Some fish grew little even after 3
   years but others grew up to 60 cm after 8 years at large. Relative
   weight decreased between release and recapture for 77\% of recaptured
   hatchery sturgeon. Relative weights were 88\% of optimum at release,
   78\% of optimum at recapture, and increased with period at large.
   Relative weight at recapture was inversely correlated with growth in
   length and opposite to our initial expectations that higher condition
   would accompany faster growth. No obvious patterns in survival or growth
   of juveniles could be related to size, time, or condition of release.
   These initial results provide a basis for adjusting releases of hatchery
   fish consistent with the conservation goal of the hatchery program and

Abstract = {{Resistance to methyl-parathion among Nebraska western corn rootworm.
   Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, populations is associated with
   increased hydrolytic metabolism of an organophosphate insecticide
   substrate. An electrophoretic method to identify resistant individuals
   based on the staining intensity of esterase isozymes on nondenaturing
   polyacrylamide gels was developed. Three groups of esterases (I, II, and
   III) were visible on the gels, but only group II esterase isozymes were
   intensified in resistant populations. A total of 26 and 31 field
   populations of western corn rootworms from Nebraska (in 1998 and 1999,
   respectively) were assessed with nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (PAGE) assays and diagnostic concentration bioassays.
   Significant correlations were observed between the two diagnostic
   assays. Group II esterase isozymes provide a reliable biochemical marker
   for detection of methyl-parathion resistance in individual western corn
   rootworms and a tool for monitoring the frequency of resistant
   individuals in field populations.}},

Abstract = {{Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) are small, partially migrant
   shorebirds that are broadly distributed across North America. Snowy
   Plover distribution west of the Rocky Mountains has been well described.
   However, distribution and abundance east of the Rocky Mountains has not
   received much attention despite current status and ESA listing concerns
   for Snowy Plovers in the southeastern United States and the Caribbean.
   Thus, a first step in developing a monitoring program for Snowy Plovers
   is to understand the species' distribution. We summarize information on
   distribution and abundance of Snowy Plovers in the eastern United
   States, Caribbean, and Bahamas. Breeding and winter distribution maps
   for the continental United States were generated from a database of 3563
   records from 388 sites in continental North America constructed from
   International Shorebird Survey (ISS), Christmas Bird Count (CBC),
   unpublished field data, and published accounts. Comparison of maximum
   counts per site (1980-present) indicated the number of breeding Snowy
   Plovers was greatest in Kansas and Oklahoma, while the greatest number
   of wintering birds occurred in the Laguna Madre of Texas and Mexico.
   Snowy Plovers concentrate at sites in Oklahoma and Texas during
   migration, with higher concentrations on the upper Texas coast in spring
   compared to fall migration. Data regarding historic abundance and trends
   are limited but suggest that Snowy Plovers in the eastern United States
   may have experienced regional population declines and may have suffered
   a range contraction in Texas. Serious concerns about the conservation
   status of Snowy Plovers in the eastern United States, the Caribbean, and
   the Bahamas indicate an immediate need for systematic surveys and
   up-to-date population estimates.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, following the cleanup in the 1960s, the Thames
   Estuary has become a major nursery ground for economic and conservation
   species, and has seen the development of substantial commercial and
   recreational fisheries. The Environment Agency has both sea fisheries
   and freshwater fisheries statutory powers in the estuary. A unique and
   focussed survey programme has been developed to inform management
   policies. A Fisheries Management Action Plan has been developed to
   promote integrated salmonid, eel Anguilla anguilla and sea fisheries
   management, promote nurseries, sustainable exploitation and habitat
   protection and enhancement. Data are used to influence water quality,
   water resources and flood defence management regimes and in the planning
   field to influence development proposals. Consensus and collaboration
   have been built through the Thames Estuary Partnership. Research aims
   identified through the Thames Estuary Research Forum are described
   together with future pressures on key species. The survey rationales
   being developed will contribute to new standard sampling strategies and
   classification scheme to meet the requirements of the E.U. Water
   Framework Directive. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. on

Abstract = {{On an annual basis >10 million individuals of c. 35 fish species are
   impinged at the EC20 unit of the Eems power station located on the Ems
   Estuary. The most abundant are: herring Clupea harengus, gobies
   (Gobiidae), Nilsson's pipefish Sygnathus rostellatus, three-spined
   stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus and sprat Sprattus sprattus. The
   impingement shows a seasonal pattern which reflects the presence of the
   fishes in the estuary. The results are compared with other impingement
   studies at power stations on the Belgian and Dutch estuaries.
   In 1995, the cooling water entrance was displaced from the shoreline to
   300 In off the coast at the edge of the tidal channel. The effect of
   this relocation on the level of fish impingement, determined by
   comparing the ratio of fish density in the cooling water and in the
   estuary before (1992-1993) and after (1996-1997) the relocation of the
   intake canal is discussed. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British

Abstract = {{Estuarine habitats, and the fish assemblages associated with them, are
   potentially impacted upon by many anthropogenic influences which can
   have a direct influence on the food resources, distribution, diversity,
   breeding, abundance, growth, survival and behaviour of both resident and
   migrant fish species. The direct and indirect coupling between
   ichthyofaunal communities and human impacts on estuaries reinforces the
   choice of this taxonomic group as a biological indicator that can assist
   in the formulation of environmental and ecological quality objectives,
   and in the setting of environmental and ecological quality standards for
   these systems. This review examines the rationale and value of selecting
   fishes as bio-indicators of human induced changes within estuaries,
   using examples from both the northern and southern hemispheres. The
   monitoring of estuarine `health' using fish studies at the individual
   and community level is discussed, with an emphasis on the potential use
   of estuarine fishes and their monitoring and surveillance in national
   and international management programmes. In illustrating the above
   concept, examples are presented of the way in which fishes are
   threatened by anthropogenic impacts and of the way in which teleosts can
   contribute to a monitoring of estuarine ecosystem health. (C) 2002 The

Abstract = {{Organic matter and its replenishment has become a major component of
   soil health management programs. Many of the soil's physical, chemical,
   and biological properties are a function of organic matter content and
   quality. Adding organic matter to soil influences diverse and important
   biological activities. The diversity and number of free-living and
   plant-parasitic nematodes are altered by rotational crops, cover crops,
   green manures, and other sources of organic matter. Soil management
   programs should include the use of the proper organic materials to
   improve soil chemical, physical, and biological parameters and to
   suppress plant-parasitic nematodes and soilborne pathogens. It is
   critical to monitor the effects of organic matter additions on
   activities of major and minor plant-parasitic nematodes in the
   production system. This paper presents a general review of information
   in the literature on the effects of crop rotation, cover crops, and
   green manures On nematodes and their damage to economic crops.}},

Abstract = {{We applied time series of fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data
   to develop indices of relative biomass and estimates of absolute
   abundance and biomass for the Maryland oyster population. The principal
   objectives for this work were to specify a baseline and determine trends
   relative to the Chesapeake Bay Program's goal to achieve a 10-fold
   increase in the standing stock of oysters in the Bay from a 1994
   baseline. Population biomass varied by 3-fold from 1986-2001, with most
   of the variation caused by changes in the stock of market-sized oysters.
   There were also important spatial differences in population structure
   and trends over a gradient of salinity. Lagged correlations between
   small oyster biomass and either market-sized oyster biomass or landings
   were not statistically significant but suggested that most of the
   market-sized oysters and those harvested were four to five years old.
   The index of relative biomass for market-sized oysters proved to be a
   useful predictor of annual harvests in Maryland. We used this
   relationship to estimate absolute abundance and biomass of oysters for
   the time series. The latter estimates may be biased negatively with
   respect to true abundance and biomass because of biases in both the
   fishery and the fishery-independent monitoring program. The index of
   relative biomass will be a suitable measure of population status
   relative to the oyster restoration goal only so long as the population
   remains at relatively low levels. Because the index has a theoretical
   maximum of about 75\% of the 10-fold goal, a quantitative estimator will
   be required for higher population levels.}},

Abstract = {{An initial failed invasion by the zebra mussel, followed by an abrupt
   shift to dense populations, is documented for polluted, hypereutrophic
   Onondaga Lake. The Lake is located in a region of New York subject to
   high infestation rates by the zebra mussel. Our analysis was supported
   by: 1) monitoring of multiple life stages of the zebra mussel, including
   veligers, pediveliger deposition, and adults in the lake and an
   adjoining source river over a 4-y interval, 2) a quantitative substrate
   survey of the lake's nearshore zone, 3) in situ growth-rate experiments,
   and 4) long-term water-quality monitoring data for the lake. Despite the
   availability of appropriate substrate and food, near-optimal temperature
   and primary water chemistry requirements, and continuing inputs of
   veligers since the early 1990s, veliger concentrations (<0.2
   individuals/L) and adult densities in the nearshore zone (<1 individual
   /m(2)) remained extremely low in the lake through 1998. This failure was
   caused by the toxic effects on early life stages from high lake
   concentrations of forms of N, particularly total ammonia (T-NH(3)) and
   free (unionized) ammonia (NH(3)), associated with discharges of a
   domestic waste-water-treatment plant (WWTP). The abrupt shift from
   extremely low to high densities in the summer of 1999 continued through
   2000 (maximum of similar to65,000 individuals/m(2)), coincident with
   abrupt decreases in concentrations of T-NH(3) and NH(3) associated with
   increased treatment at the WWTP Water-quality monitoring data suggested
   that summertime T-NH(3) and NH(3) concentrations of similar to2 and 0.05
   mg/L, respectively, were adequate to prevent the development of dense
   zebra mussel populations in the lake. The establishment of dense
   populations of zebra mussels in Onondaga Lake may complicate the
   resolution of impacts/benefits of an ongoing rehabilitation program to
   remediate domestic waste inputs in the lake.}},

Abstract = {{In the southeastern USA, harvest of pine straw sometimes involves
   mechanical raking of natural Pinus palustris (longleaf pine)
   communities. Little is known about the effects of raking nor how these
   effects may vary in time and space. In a two yr experiment, we examined
   the effects of mechanized raking on Pinus palustris dominated
   communities (scrub oak, dry savanna, and mesic savanna) by monitoring
   vegetation at seven spatial scales (0.01-100 m(2)). We measured
   floristic similarity and the proportion of species initially present
   that were gained (i.e. new species) or lost during four sampling
   periods. Relationships between spatial scale and these community
   attributes were analyzed using a repeated measures approach and
   functional response curves. Spatial scale clearly affected observed
   rates of species loss and floristic similarity; losses declined and
   floristic similarity increased as scale increased. We relate these
   patterns to expanding population sizes with scale and our inability to
   detect species reductions in large populations. Scale had little
   influence on species gains. The effects of raking did not differ across
   scales, but raking caused greater mean losses of species and greater
   mean changes in floristic similarity when mean values were calculated
   over all scales. Raking also increased the mean rate of species gains in
   the mesic savanna during one period. Otherwise, interaction effects of
   community and raking were largely absent from both mean values and
   response curves. Despite significant short-term effects of raking,
   changes in species richness were minor.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial resources used by a population of lace monitors (Varanus
   varius) were examined over an active season (September April) and an
   inactive season (May-August). In total, 33 monitors were observed, of
   which 23 monitors were radio-tracked for up to I I months. Radio
   tracking provided new information on the spatial ecology of V. varius.
   During summer (December February), V. varius moved often, over large
   (184.5 ha) overlapping home-range areas. In the intermediate seasons of
   spring (September-November) and autumn (March-May), monitors moved less
   often and used less than 39\% of the summer home-range. Finally, in the
   cold winter season (June-August) many monitors did not move at all and
   most used less than 5\% of their summer home-ranges. The thermal
   environment, and reproductive status of V varius affected its use of
   space, and the importance of these factors varied seasonally. No spatial
   segregation was noted between monitors, with home-ranges overlapping on
   average for eight other radio-tracked monitors. The home-range size of
   V. varius was accurately predicted using published data on body mass and
   home-range size for the Varanidae.}},

Abstract = {{The aesthetic appeal of marine reserves and the facilities provided,
   together with the increased public awareness of nature, all contribute
   to creating massive tourism in MPAs. Human activities are being changed
   inside MPAs in two ways: humans as top predators are generally being
   removed, but in turn they could come back at great numbers as visitors.
   Many authors have studied the impact of visitors, and the results
   highlight that the consequences can be very substantial and may
   represent a severe threat to the overall diversity of marine
   communities. To date, the documented effects of human recreational
   activities on natural communities are restricted to assessing the
   consequences of trampling over intertidal and upper infralittoral areas,
   boat anchoring in seagrass meadows and tropical reefs, or SCUBA-diving.
   In this paper we review the available literature world-wide on the
   effects of human recreational activities in marine communities. The
   objective is to address the extent of these impacts and to highlight the
   gaps of knowledge to be filled in order to optimise decision making on
   research, monitoring, and management of Mediterranean MPAs. A specific
   plan for managing tourism use in each Mediterranean MPA should be
   designated. These strategies should be implemented through education,
   training, and changes in legislation and policy.}},

Abstract = {{Seals are high trophic level feeders that bioaccumulate many
   contaminants to a greater degree than most lower trophic level
   organisms. Their trophic status in the marine food web and wide-spread
   distribution make seals useful sentinels of arctic environmental change.
   The purpose of this investigation is to document the levels and
   bioaccumulation potential of radiocaesium in high latitude seal species
   for which data have not previously been available. The study was carried
   out on harp, ringed, and bearded seals caught north of the island
   archipelago of Svalbard (82degreesN) in 1999. The results are then
   compared with previous studies in order to elucidate factors responsible
   for bioaccumulation in Arctic seals. Concentrations of Cs-137 were
   determined in muscle, liver and kidney samples from a total of 10
   juvenile and one adult seal. The mean concentration in muscle samples
   for all animals was 0.23 +/- 0.045 Bq/kg f.w. Cs-137 concentrations in
   both liver and kidney samples were near detection limits (approximate
   to0.2 Bq/kg f.w.). The results are consistent with previous studies
   indicating low levels of radiocaesium in Arctic seals in response to a
   long term trend of decreasing levels of Cs-137 in the Barents Sea
   region. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) estimated for seals from NE
   Svalbard are low, ranging from 34 to 130. Comparing these values with
   reported BCFs for Greenland seals from other sectors of the European
   Arctic, we suggest that the combination of physiological and ecological
   factors on radiocaesium bioaccumulation is comparable among different
   Arctic seal populations. The application of this work to Arctic
   monitoring and assessment programs is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Counts of roosting bats undertaken within caves are used frequently as
   indicators of population size, long-term indices of population trends,
   and as measures of response to management. Numbers of New Zealand
   long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus Forster 1844) using Grand
   Canyon Cave were monitored over 8 years. Grand Canyon Cave is a focal
   point for one of the largest known populations. Its has been used by
   long-tailed bats consistently for >40 years. The aims of this study were
   to examine the utility of cave-roost counts for long-term monitoring of
   population trends in this threatened species, and to establish a
   baseline for future monitoring. Two population indices, number of bats
   counted roosting inside the cave during the day and net number emerging
   at dusk, were not significantly different. Monthly and daily counts were
   characterised by high variability. Indices varied significantly through
   the year but not between years. Distribution of bats within the cave was
   not random. Bats avoided roosting within 30 in of each entrance and
   larger groups were always concentrated along two 50 in stretches of cave
   ceiling. Large groups occurred when cave temperatures ranged from
   10-13degreesC, suggesting an optimum temperature range. Maximum counts
   of 250 (day roosting) and 358 (night roosting) bats confirm that Grand
   Canyon Cave is significant as a site for C. tuberculatus. Counts can be
   used as a baseline against which to judge future trends in the
   population of C. tuberculatus at Grand Canyon Cave and contribute to
   national monitoring of bat populations. Effects of variation can be
   overcome with standardisation of repeat counts, adopting a sampling
   frequency that provides sufficient power to detect changes, and use of
   statistical models that separate sampling effects from variance in bat
   activity. Recommendations for future monitoring are made.}},

Abstract = {{Studies suggest a worldwide decline in amphibians during the last four
   decades, however these studies have rarely included long-term (>10
   years) studies involving interacting species of North American
   salamanders. in this study, populations of spotted salamanders
   (Ambystoma maculatum) and Jefferson Salamanders (A jeffersonianum) at
   Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in northeast Ohio were
   monitored for 12 years from 1990-2001 to provide baseline data and to
   test the null hypothesis that these populations are not in decline. The
   study sites include a semipermanent wetland (ca 1500 m(2)) and a
   temporary wetland (10 m(2)) that are 80 m apart on a wooded hill. I
   monitored populations at each wetland by estimating egg mass density,
   mean number of eggs per mass, and embryo mortality. From these I
   calculated estimates of egg and hatchling densities and the total number
   of eggs, surviving embryos, and adult females breeding at each wetland.
   The densities of eggs and hatchlings; of each species were greater in
   the large pond and greater for spotted salamanders. The number of
   eggs/egg mass was greater in the large pond and was greater from
   1995-1999 than 1990-1994 and 2000-2001. Embryo mortality supports
   predictions based on water temperature and pH. Spotted salamander embryo
   survival was correlated with increasing pond water pH. There was no
   significant trend over time in the number of embryos surviving to hatch
   each year for either species. This long-term study supports the
   hypothesis that these populations are in stable coexistence and
   demonstrates that some populations of North American salamanders are not
   in decline.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on competing mammalian species in the past have focused mainly
   on the competitive exclusion of one species from the preferred habitat
   of the other. Investigations on effects of competition and coexistence
   on individual fitness are rare. In this study we were able to measure
   effects of interspecific competition on major fitness components, using
   a system with two vole species in asymmetric competition. Survival,
   reproduction and space use of bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus females
   were monitored in 32 enclosed populations over four replicates of eight
   parallel ran enclosures, Into half of the enclosures we introduced an
   additional number of field voles Microtus agrestis a dominant
   competitor.
   Survival of bank vole females was lower under competitive conditions.
   Total number of breeding females was lower in populations coexisting
   with competitors. Territory size of bank vote females decreased. Females
   body weight and litter size bank vole litters conceived during the
   experiment were not affected by interspecific competition. These
   characteristics should respond to differences in food resources, and
   territory size should increase if food was scarce, thus we found no
   indication of direct exploitation competition between the two species.
   Space use was overlapping between the species, but individuals of both
   species were never caught together in the same trap, indicating
   avoidance behaviour.
   We conclude that adult bank vole females do suffer fitness consequences
   through interference competition with field voles, probably basing on
   increased number of aggressive encounters in the presence of the
   dominant species. Our results suggest, that direct interference rather
   than indirect exploitation competition may be the cause for observed
   fitness decrease in bank vole females.}},

Abstract = {{The gall abundance of Baizongia pistaciae (L.) (Pemphiginae: Fordini) on
   marked Pistacia palaestina trees (Anacardiaceac) was monitored for 20
   years at two natural sites in Israel (Carmel, in the. center of the host
   distribution, and Beit Guvrin, near its southern limit), and in the
   botanical gardens of Tel Aviv University. Gall abundance varied between
   zero and 500 galls/tree and fluctuated from year to year. The analysis
   aimed at a diagnosis of the underlying causes of the temporal changes in
   gall abundance. Weather variables were expected to synchronize gall
   abundance on most trees on the same site. There was little indication of
   synchrony among trees in most years. Correlations of mean gall abundance
   with weather variables were low (<0.4, explaining <16\% of the
   variation) and almost none were significant. The temporal pattern of
   gall abundance was analyzed for every tree separately (the
   ``autecological{''} paradigm). There was no convincing evidence of
   self-regulation (density-dependence) in gall abundance on any tree,
   although the rate of change in abundance tended to decrease with
   increasing density on some trees. At one site (Carmel), significantly
   more abundance peaks (1 SD above the mean) occurred in ``wet{''} years
   (precipitation above average) than in ``dry{''} years. This pattern was
   not observed at the other sites. The biannual fluctuations in abundance,
   observed in the first 10 years of the study, were far less clear when
   the 20-year sequence was analyzed. If the causative mechanism is tree
   stress-as assumed previously-then the biannual pattern may not be
   expected except in years of favorable conditions, when gall abundance is
   high enough to drain the tree of resources and cause a lower gall
   abundance the following year. The life cycle of galling aphids is very
   complex. A clone enclosed in a gall on a tree alternates with a
   subterranean population on the roots of herbaceous plants, with two
   migratory phases in between. Moreover, a sequence of parthenogenetic
   generations is interrupted by a single event of sexual reproduction. In
   B. pistaciae, this cycle takes two years to complete. Regulating
   mechanisms of gall abundance at the different stages may work in
   different directions, canceling each other out. I suggest that direct
   effects of weather on the aphids at any stage of their complex life
   cycle may be obscured when the net result (gall abundance) is studied.
   Weather effects may be detectable only when it is extremely favorable or
   unfavorable for the aphids (or the host plant).}},

Abstract = {{Guanabara Bay is a 384-km(2) coastal bay with 70\% of the population of
   the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro located within its drainage
   basin. The water quality of the Bay is impacted by domestic and
   industrial runoff, of which only 15\% has been adequately treated.
   However, based on a 14-year monitoring program, the water quality for
   most of Guanabara Bay remains acceptable because of intense tidal
   flushing, and we failed to find a worsening of conditions during the
   14-year study. The inner shallow regions of the Bay, the western and
   northwestern parts, receive most of the drainage from metropolitan Rio
   de Janeiro. It is here that the water quality is alarmingly poor,
   characterized by hypertrophic conditions and occasional hypoxic events.
   Fecal coliform counts in these inner reaches of the Bay are 4-100 times
   higher than the maximum acceptable count for recreational waters.
   Hypertrophic conditions prevail in Guanabara Bay, which is characterized
   by low dissolved oxygen, high biochemical oxygen demand, peaks in fecal
   coliform, and extremely high chlorophyll-a concentrations, which reflect
   high quantities of nutrients entering the system. These anthropogenic
   pressures are a threat to planktonic and benthic communities and are
   reminiscent of San Francisco Bay 30 years ago. The Guanabara Bay water
   quality could be returned to pre-1950 conditions, but it would require
   sufficient political will and economic investment to ensure that at
   least 80-90\% of the domestic and industrial sewage were treated
   adequately.}},

Abstract = {{The Falkland Islands are an important breeding site for three species of
   penguin, gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), southern rockhopper (Eudyptes c.
   chrysocome) and Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). The total
   penguin population for the Falkland Islands has declined by 84\% during
   the 1980s and 1990s. These declines did not occur in coastal South
   America, so potential causes of decline in the Falklands have been
   investigated. The suspected cause of decline is a reduction of fish and
   squid due to large-scale commercial fishing around the Falklands. Since
   1995 rockhopper and gentoo populations have ceased declining, and appear
   to have reached a new equilibrium, albeit at a much lower level than
   before commercial fishing began. This has been matched by improved
   chick-rearing success and juvenile survival, however Magellanic penguins
   continue declining in the Falklands. Diet analysis shows that Magellanic
   penguins have a greater reliance on squid and fish species being taken
   commercially. In 1998 drilling for oil began around the Falklands,
   despite warnings that environmental protection was inadequate. Within a
   month the first of three separate oil spills occurred, killing and
   contaminating hundreds of penguins. The oil rig completed its drilling
   operations after five months and left the Falklands. Since then no
   further oil spills have occurred. Oil exploration is due to recommence
   in the near future, and environmental safeguards have not been improved.
   Ecotourism has increased rapidly over recent years in the Falklands,
   with penguins being the main attraction. Monitoring of the affects of
   tourism has concentrated on breeding success and population change, and
   the results indicate no detrimental affects on penguin populations at
   the current level. This paper investigates potential causes of penguin
   decline in the Falkland Islands, drawing comparison with populations in
   Chile which appear to be healthy. It concludes by calling on the
   Falkland Islands Government to exclude large-scale commercial fishing
   close to penguin breeding sites.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of reproductive units, i.e. family groups, constitute the main
   monitoring index for lynx Lynx lynx populations in Scandinavia. However,
   for some purposes it is necessary to extrapolate from the number of
   family groups to obtain an estimate of total population size. Using data
   on survival and reproduction from radio-marked lynx from three
   Scandinavian study areas, we simulated the lynx population structure in
   February. The average proportions of family groups out of all
   independent individuals, i.e. adults and yearlings, in these simulations
   were 21\% +/- 2.1 (SD), 22\% +/- 3.6 and 27\% +/- 3.1 for the data sets
   from northern Sweden (Sarek), southeastern Norway (Hedmark) and
   south-central Sweden (Bergslagen), respectively, and the overall mean
   for all three study areas was 23\% +/- 3.8. This translated into
   extrapolation factors of 6.14 +/- 0.44, 6.24 +/- 0.73 and 5.48 +/- 0.40
   for the three study areas, respectively, leading to an overall mean for
   all three study areas of 5.95 +/- 0.64. We conclude, that it is possible
   to extrapolate from the number of family groups to obtain an estimate of
   total lynx population size with a statistical measure of uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Locating isolated populations is important to conservation efforts. Here
   I describe a technique using satellite imagery to predict species
   presence across large areas (e.g., watershed or state). The technique
   requires knowledge of species presence at twining sites within the area
   of interest. These training sites are used to develop a supervised
   classification, using Mahalanobis distances as a classification rule, to
   identify similar sites. The technique should provide better prediction
   than a typical habitat classification (i.e., a habitat map derived from
   satellite image interpretation) because all data in the image can be
   used to develop the model. As an example, I developed and tested a model
   to predict presence of Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) within
   the 1.48 x 10(6) ha lower Flint River basin, Georgia. As predicted, the
   model was better than a habitat classification to identify presence of
   Bachman's sparrow. Using satellite imagery to develop species-presence
   models might provide more accurate models of species occurrence, thus
   reducing time needed to search for isolated populations.}},

Abstract = {{Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have been declining
   significantly throughout much of their North American range. Food plots
   are a management tool that might alleviate the bobwhite's winter stress,
   improving population sustainability, but their positive effect could be
   negated by increased hunter harvests near food plots. Food plots have
   been used to increase available winter food sources for northern
   bobwhites oil the Fort Riley Military Reservation since the early 1960s,
   We hypothesized that food plots increased hunting mortality of bobwhites
   by concentrating hunters and bobwhites around food plots. We monitored
   554 radiomarked bobwhites during the 1994-1995, 1995-1996, and 1996-1997
   winters to estimate Survival and cause-specific mortality near and far
   from food plots. Effect of hunting mortality near food plot.,, was weak
   and inconsistent. Feeding in food plots by nontarget wildlife
   compromised the comparison of overwinter survival of bobwhites near and
   far from food plots during A years and study sites. Avian and mammalian
   predators accounted for 55\% of overwinter mortality of radiomarked
   bobwhites during the study. We provide recommendations to reduce
   mortality and increase survival of bobwhites on Fort Riley during
   winter. These strategies might apply to other bobwhite populations in
   North America.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the efficacy of employing a track-count index to monitor
   trends in abundance of the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in the
   Russian Far Last, Conservation of the Amur tiger depends upon
   region-specific information regarding population trends. A traditional
   tiger census technique has inherent logistical and theoretic
   constraints, but a logistically feasible and statistically rigorous
   alternative compatible with the historic, tradition of winter track
   counts has not yet been developed. We used data collected during 434
   surveys of foot routes conducted from 1995-1999 to examine
   characteristics of track counts that will influence monitoring design.
   Longevity of tiger tracks in snow was 7-8 clays in January and February
   but only an average of 2 days in March. Route length and days since last
   snow were the 2 most significant design variables explaining variability
   in detection rate of tracks on survey routes. Variation in track counts
   observed from toot surveys 0.5 to 28 km long suggested that an efficient
   survey design would employ routes 10 to 15 km in length. Results of
   simulations examining power suggested that track count,, could be
   employed as part of a system to monitor Amur tiger abundance given the
   critical assumption that changes in track counts reflected changes in
   tiger population size. A monitoring system employing 10 to 20 routes 12
   to 15 km long, sampled twice each year, could provide over 80\% power to
   detect a 10\% annual decline in tiger track with a 20\% chance of type 1
   errors (alpha=0.20). Approaches to monitoring large carnivores with
   track counts usually have employed presence-absence surveys. The greater
   power to detect population declines that may be achieved through counts
   of tracks rather than a presence-absence survey) led us to favor use of
   track counts to monitor tigers in the Russian Far East.}},

Abstract = {{We devised a new method to estimate game populations using relative
   population sizes and numbers harvested in a population management
   program for Sika deer (Cervus nippon) in eastern Hokkaido, Japan. The
   Government of Hokkaido estimated the absolute deer population to be
   between 74,000 and 166,000 individuals (90\% CI) as of March 1994. We
   took the ratio of the population index obtained by a spotlight census in
   year t to that in 1993. We estimated the relative population size in
   2000 to be between 58 and 101\% (95\% CI). We analyzed a
   stage-structured population dynamics model that included uncertainty and
   yearly changes in parameter values. We assumed that ranges of biological
   parameter values were consistent with the 16-21\% rate of natural
   population increase per year estimated by a field survey. The population
   dynamics model suggested that if the population size in 1993 was below
   170,000, miles would have, become extinct. The model also suggested that
   if its size in 1993 was larger than 330,000, the population would not
   have subsequently decreased. Therefore, we estimated the population in
   1993 to be between these two extremes. We provide a method of reviewing
   estimates of absolute population size by monitoring subsequent census
   and harvest data.}},

Abstract = {{We obtained index estimates of carrying capacity W for the Washington
   sea otter (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) population as products of the density
   of sea otters at equilibrium within a portion of their existing range
   and the total amount of available habitat. We classified sea otter
   habitat as rocky, sandy, or mixed during aerial surveys along the
   Washington coast in March 2000. We characterized substrate type and kelp
   composition from the coast to the 40-m depth contour and computed area
   (km(2)) and available coastline (km) within each habitat. We calculated
   maximum foraging depths and maximum distance from shore for 68 sea
   otters radiotagged between 1994 and 1998 and used the estimites to
   approximate the offshore extent of sea otter habitat. We used the most
   current population survey data (1996-1999) to obtain equilibrium
   densities of sea otters in rocky habitat in Washington. Because sea
   otters have only recently occupied sandy or mixed sites, the equilibrium
   densities for these habitats represent a proportional density, based on
   current counts in the rocky equilibrium region in Washington and
   available data from the California sea otter population. Index estimates
   of K for the Washington sea otter population range from 1,372 (CV 0.13)
   to 2,734 (CV 0.13). These estimates are useful for sea otter management
   because they directly relate to the index counts Used to monitor the
   population since 1977. Our results will facilitate decision-making by
   entrusted management agencies regarding stock assessment and population
   status under the United States Marine Mammal Protection Act.}},

Abstract = {{The Broad-winged Hawk (Buteo platypterus) breeds in eastern and central
   Canada and the United States, and winters in Central America and
   northern and central South America. Birders and ornithologists count
   migrating Broad-winged Hawks at dozens of traditional watch sites
   throughout the northeastern United States. We modeled counts of
   migrating Broad-winged Hawks from two raptor migration watch sites:
   Montclair Hawk Lookout, New Jersey, and Hawk Mountain Sanctuary,
   Pennsylvania, to determine whether annual abundance and trend estimates
   from individual sites within the mid-Atlantic states are representative
   of the region as a whole. We restricted ourselves to counts made between
   10:00 and 16:00 EST during September to standardize count effort between
   sites. We created one model set for annual counts and another model set
   for daily counts. When modeling daily counts we incorporated weather and
   identity of individual observers. Akaike's Information Criteria were
   used to select the best model from an initial set of competing models.
   Annual counts declined at both sites during 1979-1998. Broad-winged Hawk
   migration began, peaked, and ended later at Montclair than at Hawk
   Mountain, even though Hawk Mountain is 155 km west-southwest of
   Montclair. Mean annual counts of hawks at Montclair were more than twice
   those at Hawk Mountain, but were not correlated. Broad-winged Hawks
   counted at Montclair may not be the same birds as those counted at Hawk
   Mountain. Rather, the two sites may be monitoring different regional
   subpopulations. Broad-winged Hawks counted at the two sites may use
   different migration tactics, with those counted at Hawk Mountain being
   more likely to slope soar, and those at Montclair more likely to use
   thermal soaring. A system of multiple watch sites is needed to monitor
   various breeding populations of this widely dispersed migrant.}},

Abstract = {{Red deer (Cervus elaphus) introduced to Patagonia have reached high
   densities in forest-steppe ecotones and have been monitored since 1992.
   Severe drought conditions prevailed during spring to autumn of 1998/99,
   followed by a spring-summer (2000) with above average moisture and
   temperatures, resulting in high primary productivity. At the same time
   and due to the previous drought, there were less deer and fewer females
   with calves, resulting in the highest recorded level of physical
   condition of females. I compared offspring sex ratios of red deer during
   an average period (1992-98), a drought year (1999), and an above-average
   year (2000).
   Adult females collected and examined during winter 1999 (n = 50)
   revealed a pregnancy rate of 56\% as compared to 98\% in 1992-98 (n =
   88), or 100\% in 2000 ( = 70). Body fat reserves in 1999 were severely
   depleted in most animals, irrespective of reproductive status; there
   were no signs of resorptions or abortions. The fetal sex ratio (n = 69)
   was 46\% males during 1992-98, 71\% males after the drought, and 39\%
   males in 2000. Primiparous 2-year old females had 90\% male and 100\%
   female fetuses in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Mothers with female or
   male fetuses averaged 6.7 and 5.2 years, respectively (P = 0.14).
   The male-biased and female-biased offspring ratios in 1999 and 2000
   contrast other reports that only females in best condition tend to have
   male-biased offspring. The temporal proximity of average years, a
   drought followed by an above-average year shows that changes in
   offspring sex ratios were immediate. In particular, due to the imminent
   chronology of events, the observed changes were unlikely related to
   changes within the female population, such as changes in age structure
   or dominance relationships. Rather, a conclusive relationship to energy
   reserves during breeding emerged as the underlying principle affecting
   the offspring sex ratios.}},

Abstract = {{As UK grey partridge (Perdix perdix) numbers declined over the last half
   century, shooting estates changed the emphasis of game management, from
   wild grey partridges to reared released pheasants (Phasianas colchicus).
   A recent theory suggested that parasites carried by reared released
   pheasants may be partially responsible for the decline in the numbers of
   grey partridges. We used long-running monitoring data from two sites in
   lowland England to look for relationships between proximity to pheasant
   release pens and grey partridge population parameters
   1. At one study area, 20 km(2) for 18 years proximity to release pens
   was associated with young-to-old ratio. However, the effect of proximity
   to release pens was probably an effect of habitat composition, as
   partridge-friendly habitats such as beetle banks and cereal crops were
   found away from release pens, with less favoured habitats such as grass,
   winter game cover crops and natural regeneration set-aside being found
   near release pens.
   2. In the other study area, 62km(2) for 33 years we found no effect of
   proximity to release pens on grey partridge density, fecundity or
   survival.
   In conclusion, we were unable to find convincing evidence for an effect
   of proximity of pheasant release pens.}},

Abstract = {{A recently available submersible fluorescent probe was configured and
   used to survey the vertical distribution of the deep-living toxic and
   filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix (Oscillatoria) rubescens among
   the autochthonous algal communities in Lake Bourget, France. This in
   situ measuring spectrofluorometer, which can be used to perform
   chlorophyll analysis and integrated algal class determination, provides
   a realistic estimation of the abundance and dynamics of the
   cyanobacterial population that is known to produce the hepatotoxic
   heptapeptides microcystin RR and LR. Data provided from in-line
   measurements using the probe and from R rubescens cell counts obtained
   by discrete sampling were closely correlated (r = 0.899, p < 0.01), as
   were in-line data and spectrophotometric total chlorophyll a
   measurements (r = 0.775, p < 0.01). A survey conducted from December
   1999 to May 2001 revealed that P. rubescens exhibits a deep maximum
   level (typically between 10 and 15 m) in spring and summer (reaching
   concentrations of up to 20 mug equivalent chl a 1(-1), i.e. 27 000 cells
   ml(-1)), whereas it spreads from the surface either to the top of the
   thermocline or to the bottom of the lake, in autumn and winter
   respectively. We propose that the probe could be used as a powerful tool
   for assaying the occurrence and dynamics of microalgal blooms, typically
   toxic cyanobacteria, that call for accurate and rapid monitoring to
   assess the health of the ecosystem and to alert the authorities about
   potential risks regarding pumping and use of the lake water for
   drinking-water production purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work was to assess the effect of digenean
   trematodes on indirect mortality of the cockle Cerastoderma edule, an
   infaunal bivalve. The tested hypothesis was that parasites altered the
   burrowing capacity of cockles and thus exposed them at the sediment
   surface, where they are more vulnerable to predators. If the predator is
   the final host, this mechanism, which drives the cockle out of the
   sediment, is considered as a `favourization'. Cockle populations from 2
   stations in Arcachon Bay (France)-Banc d'Arguin (oceanic situation) and
   La Canelette (lagoonal situation)were sampled for 1 yr. At La Canelette,
   monitoring every 2 d showed that 50 \% of adult cockles regularly
   migrated to the sediment surface at a rate of 5 cockles m(-2) yr(-1) and
   disappeared in a few days. In the laboratory, 67 \% of these `surface
   cockles' did not burrow again, suggesting that they would die in the
   field. Moreover, mortality measured after 7 d in the laboratory was 2 to
   5 times higher than mortality of `buried cockles', at both stations and
   particularly during summer. Species richness and abundance of digeneans
   from both stations were compared in `buried' and `surface' individuals
   to determine whether parasites played a role in cockle migration and
   mortality. Ten and 9 digeneans were found at Banc d'Arguin and La
   Canelette, respectively, with Himasthla quissetensis and Labratrema
   minimus being the most prevalent and abundant species at both stations.
   The abundance of H. quissetensis was slightly higher in surface cockles
   at Banc d'Arguin, but the difference fluctuated with station and cockle
   age (or size). L. minimus prevalence was only higher in surface cockles
   at La Canelette. In the latter station, we estimated that L, minim us
   and H. quissetensis were responsible for the emergence of 9 and 2 \%,
   respectively, of the buried cockles. Although this favourization
   mechanism may induce some mortality in cockles, it does not alone
   explain the magnitude of the observed mortalities (41 and 57 \% at La
   Canelette and Banc d'Arguin, respectively). A correspondence analysis
   did not show the presence of a particular parasite community in buried
   or surface cockles, which could explain these high surface cockle
   mortalities in association with the 2 dominant digeneans.}},

Abstract = {{The immune status of season-independent Atlantic salmon smolt may be
   affected by changes in photoperiod and high rearing temperatures.
   Variations in different leucocyte subpopulations were measured in
   photo-manipulated out-of-season (0+) Atlantic salmon smolt by use of
   flow cytometry and specific monoclonal antibodies. 0+ smolts were
   produced by exposing parr to continuous light (LD 24:0) until June 10
   followed by a ``winter{''} photoperiod (LD 12:12) for 6 weeks, and then
   continuous light. Three different groups were studied; untreated smolt
   (UT), smolt injected with a commercial multivalent oil-adjuvanted
   vaccine (VA), and smolt injected with the saline/oil-adjuvant used in
   the vaccine (AD). The fish were injected in the ``winter{''}
   photoperiod.
   From introduction of ``winter{''} photoperiod until 2 weeks after
   seawater transfer, fractions of B-cells (identified by G2H3),
   neutrophiles (identified by E3D9) as well as polymorphonuclear and
   B-cells (identified by C4B6) were monitored. From introducing continuous
   photoperiod and until seawater transfer, there were variations for all
   groups within the leucocyte subpopulations identified by the monoclonal
   antibodies (MAb) used. Neutrophiles had a minor increase, while the
   number of B-cells decreased. C4B6, identifying both types of cells
   recognised by E3D9 and G2H3 remained stable, indicating that the
   leucocyte fraction identified by C4B6 was not changed, but there was
   redistribution with respect to the numbers of B-cells and neutrophiles.
   After seawater transfer, another redistribution of leucocytes took
   place. A minor reduction for the neutrophiles was observed, while at the
   same time, both B-cells and the polymorphonuclear cells increased. It
   was not possible to identify any effect of vaccine and/or adjuvant on
   the leucocytes studied.
   The specific serum antibody levels measured by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were low during the experimental period. A
   low immune response was observed measured as antibody-producing cells
   (APC) by ELISPOT. The low levels of specific antibodies supported the
   findings of low APC numbers. There were indications that UT had lower
   numbers of APC compared to AD and VA.
   The results show that changes with respect to fractions of leucocyte
   populations take place during parr-smolt transformation, and these
   changes may affect the cellular and humoral immune response to
   vaccination. Different photoperiod regimes may have different effects on
   leucocyte populations and general conclusions should not be made from
   the single photoperiod studied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is changing the
   habitat and food resources of bay scallops, Argopecten irradians. As
   land-derived nitrogen (N) enters estuaries, phytoplankton abundance,
   particulate organic matter, and nitrogen content of seston may increase,
   providing a higher quantity and quality of food. Understanding these
   changes is important for monitoring declining populations or developing
   field aquaculture systems. To examine if changes in food resources due
   to nutrient enrichment will affect growth, condition, reproductive
   potential, and mortality, we conducted a field experiment in seven
   estuaries each having a different land-derived N load. We placed
   juvenile bay scallops within these estuaries for approximately 12 weeks
   while monitoring food quantity and quality. Stable isotopic signatures
   suggested that scallops assimilated food from the specific estuaries in
   which we placed them. Growth rates were relatively high and did not
   increase with higher phytoplankton concentrations, suggesting that at
   the densities we deployed, ambient phytoplankton concentrations were in
   excess of consumption ability. Growth rates decreased at sites with
   lower salinities, and where high densities of competitors (barnacles and
   slipper shells) fortuitously settled on the scallops. Condition index
   significantly increased with higher growth rates. Gonad index and
   mortality were not related to food resources, but mortality increased
   with lower salinities. Land-derived N load seems unlikely to directly
   alter condition, reproductive potential, or mortality. These results
   suggest that estuaries undergoing anthropogenic nutrient additions may
   provide food concentrations above the maximum ration assimilable,
   resulting in high bay scallop growth rates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Published documentation of insect pests and pathogens associated with
   Alnus species in Africa is very scarce. We surveyed damaging insects and
   pathogens, and arthropod natural enemies on Alnus acuminata and A.
   nepalensis in Kabale and Mbale districts, Uganda between March 1999 and
   August 2000 in order to identify the range and relative abundance of
   arthropods and pathogens associated with the Alnus species. Frequently
   encountered damaging insects on the Alnus species included Apis
   mellifera, Apion globulipenne, a Systates sp. ( Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae), Phymateus viridipes, a Lobotrachelus sp. ( Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae), Coloborrtics corticina and some Chrysomelidae. Some
   species such as Aphis fabae, Parastictococcus multispinosus and a
   Cacopsylla sp. (Homoptera: Psyllidae) were observed feeding on other
   agroforestry tree species and/or crops although they generally occurred
   at low population intensities. Spiders and parasitic Hymenoptera were
   the most common natural enemies. Diseases were more severe in nurseries
   than in the field. Damping-off caused by Fusarium oxysporum, Septoria
   brown leaf spot and stem canker were the most serious diseases of Alnus.
   The array of damaging insects and pathogens indicates a potential danger
   to the cultivation of Alnus species in Uganda as adoption of the species
   for agroforestry continues to expand in the country. In view of the
   increasing demand for Alnus species for agroforestry in Uganda, regular
   pest monitoring and appropriate control strategies are necessary.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in the use of assisted breeding
   techniques as a component of conservation programmes for a variety of
   macropods threatened with extinction. While cross-fostering is being
   conducted in some programmes in captivity, little is known about the
   best techniques for carrying this procedure out from wild populations.
   In this study we compare the success of various procedures for isolating
   small tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and brush-tailed rock wallaby
   (Petrogale penicillata) pouch young (0.4 g-410 g) for short periods (6
   hours) as a first step towards establishing a methodology for recruiting
   endangered macropod pouch young directly from the wild for
   foster-rearing in captivity. Pouch temperature and humidity were
   determined. Pouch young from females in experimental groups were
   weighed, measured and then isolated, at 30degreesC, 27degreesC or
   23degreesC, and 100\% humidity. After isolation the weight of pouch
   young maintained at 30degreesC and 27degreesC had declined significantly
   (2-17\% of body weight), whereas those held at 23degreesC and 100\%
   humidity lost less than 0.5\% of body weight. All young were reattached
   to the active teat of their mother following pouch isolation and their
   survival and growth monitored. Pouch young from the control group and
   those isolated at 23degreesC and 100\% humidity survived and grew at
   normal rates. Only the largest pouch young maintained in isolation at
   either 30degreesC or 27degreesC survived to day 7 following
   reattachment. Data indicated that the proportion of weight lost by pouch
   young as a result of isolation decreased with increasing size and age of
   the pouch young. These trials indicate that it would be possible to
   harvest very small macropod pouch young from a species in the wild with
   a very high probability that they would survive short-term isolation
   from the pouch and reattachment to the teat. The use of this procedure
   in combination with cross-fostering techniques will allow small pouch
   young from threatened macropod species to be recruited directly from the
   wild into captivity, for captive breeding or to improve genetic
   diversity in captive colonies. It should also act to reactivate diapause
   embryos in these animals and hence may accelerate breeding in wild-based
   mothers.}},

Abstract = {{Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) held ex situ can provide an important
   resource for obtaining new biological information that usually cannot be
   gleaned from free-living individuals. However, consistent captive
   propagation of the cheetah, a prerequisite for establishing a
   self-sustaining population, has not been accomplished so far. This study
   examined the effect of a husbandry regimen commonly used in ex situ
   facilities on female cheetahs. Although generally solitary in the wild,
   zoos frequently house cheetahs in pairs or groups. Using non-invasive
   hormone monitoring and quantitative behavioural observations, we studied
   the impact of such enforced social conditions on behaviour and
   ovarian/adrenal activity. Eight female cheetahs were evaluated for two
   consecutive 6-month periods, first while maintained in pairs and then as
   individuals. Subsequently four females were regrouped into two new pairs
   and monitored for another 6 months. Females in five of six pairings
   demonstrated prolonged anoestrus and displayed agonistic behaviours.
   After pair separation all females rapidly resumed oestrous cyclicity.
   Females in the sixth pair continued cycling throughout the year while
   consistently displaying affiliative grooming and no agonistic
   behaviours. Faecal corticoid patterns varied significantly among
   individuals, but appeared unrelated to behavioural or ovarian hormone
   patterns. Thus, data appear to indicate that same-sex pair-maintenance
   of behaviourally incompatible female cheetahs may lead to suppressed
   ovarian cyclicity. This suppression appears linked to agonistic
   behaviours but not to any particular adrenal hormone excretion pattern.
   Results clearly demonstrate the value of applying knowledge about in
   situ social behaviour to ex situ management practices. Conversely,
   however, non-invasive hormone monitoring conducted ex situ may help us
   to identify physiological phenomena of potential relevance for future in
   situ studies.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between exposure to p-dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) and
   urinary excretion of 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP), the major metabolite
   of p-DCB, was examined to evaluate the usefulness of the metabolite as a
   biological index for low-level exposure of p-DCB in the general
   population. Personal exposure concentrations of p-DCB and concentrations
   of 2,5-DCP excreted in the urine of 119 adults living in Osaka were
   determined. Airborne p-DCB was collected for 24 h by passive gas
   sampling tubes packed with charcoal. The tubes were exchanged every 12
   h. The sampling was started immediately after the subject woke up in the
   morning (7 A.M.). The collected p-DCB was desorbed with toluene and
   measured using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector
   (GC-ECD). On the other hand, the first morning urine samples were
   collected at the endpoint of airborne p-DCB sampling (7 A.M. the next
   morning). The urine samples were hydrolyzed with concentrated sulfuric
   acid. 2,5-DCP in the hydrolysates was extracted with n-hexane and
   measured by GC-ECD. Both p-DCB and 2,5-DCP were detected in more than
   99\% of the air and urine samples, respectively, from the participants.
   The median of p-DCB exposure concentrations for 24 h was 2.5 ppb, with a
   maximum concentration of 33.3 ppb. The median of urinary 2,5-DCP
   concentrations was 0.39 mg/g creatinine, with the maximum concentration
   of 3.32 mg/g creatinine. The regression line between the urinary 2,5-DCP
   concentration (y) and the p-DCB exposure concentration (x) was y = 0. 0
   8 0 x + 0.181, with the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81 (p <
   0.001), demonstrating a strong association between these measurements.
   Consequently, urinary 2,5-DCP should be suitable as an index for
   monitoring low-level exposure of p-DCB in the general population.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors evaluated the risk of respiratory cancer
   related to environmental pollutants among a population that resided near
   a sewage plant in Prato, Italy. Subjects included lung cancer deaths
   (1987-1996) and incident cases of lung and laryngeal cancers (1987-1994)
   among residents of Prato. The authors used the mortality or incidence
   rates for the entire population of Prato (by gender and by 5-yr age
   group) to calculate the expected cases in each census unit. Data were
   analyzed and adjusted for an index of social deprivation (Stone test).
   Among males, the excess risk of lung cancer mortality decreased as
   distance from the plant increased for 2 time periods (1987-1996 {[}p =
   .008] and 1990-1996 {[}p = .030]) and for lung cancer incidence during
   1987-1994 (p = .011). Similar results were obtained when sewage plant
   workers were excluded from the analysis. A similar, but not
   statistically significant, trend was observed among female incident lung
   cancer cases, as well as among male incident laryngeal cancer cases.
   Despite methodological limitations common to geographic studies, the
   results were consistent with those previously published on mortality
   excesses for lung cancer among plant workers under study. The role of
   environmental pollutants as a risk for respiratory cancer must be
   further clarified with additional epidemiological studies and an
   environmental monitoring program.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative tactics in reproductive behavior enable individuals to
   maximize their fitness in relation to competitors in the same
   population. In many taxa, territoriality is a common tactic of males to
   increase their reproductive success, In the bat Saccopteryx bilineata,
   territorial males defend roosting areas for females against other males
   and court females throughout the year. Peripheral males in the same
   colonies do not defend territories but compete with territorial males
   lot, reproduction with females. In this study, we monitored the behavior
   of the males in a natural colony over three reproductive seasons. We
   compared morphological and age data and measured the reproductive output
   of males adopting the territorial or peripheral tactic. No differences
   in body size or weight were detected between male types, but the
   probability of adopting a tactic seemed to be age dependent. Peripherals
   were often young males and replaced territorials in several cases,
   whereas the opposite case was not observed. Peripherals were not
   excluded from reproduction, but territorials were more likely to
   reproduce. Variation in reproductive success was high within both male
   tactics, and the reproductive success of some peripherals was comparable

Abstract = {{I investigated the vigilance behavior of brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus
   apella) in Iguazu, Argentina to determine the relative importance of
   anti-predatory vigilance versus social monitoring. Predator detection
   has been found to be the major factor driving vigilance patterns in
   other populations of Cebus, and a positive relationship between
   vigilance and the number of nearby neighbors has been found. In the
   Iguazu population, social monitoring is the primary function of
   vigilance, as indicated by a negative relationship between vigilance and
   neighbor density. Even if social monitoring and predator detection are
   totally compatible, the time trade-offs associated with vigilance
   behavior are mostly driven by social monitoring in this population. In
   addition to recording vigilance data in relation to the number of
   neighbors, several other variables were recorded in conjunction with
   vigilance behavior in order to control for possible confounding factors.
   After controlling for these factors, it was found that the number of
   neighbors within 10 m was still highly correlated with the percent of
   time spent vigilant. The average percent of time spent vigilant was
   found to be much lower in Iguazu, compared to another population of C.
   apella with higher predation pressure. The average vigilance bout was
   much closer in length to known social monitoring bouts than to known
   anti-predatory vigilance bouts. These patterns indicate that the
   predominate function of vigilance in this population of C apella is
   social monitoring. In populations with low predation pressure, the time
   costs associated with social monitoring should increase with group size,
   and increasing neighbor density. The fitness costs of social monitoring
   have not been incorporated into current social models, and these results
   indicate that these models may not be appropriate for all study
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of stoat Mustela erminea predation on
   the endangered Hutton's shearwater Puffinus huttoni. Breeding success of
   Hutton' shearwaters was significantly lower in two seasons of stoat
   control than in eight seasons with no control: suggesting that natural
   environmental variation has a greater influence on breeding success than
   stoat predation. Monitoring Hutton's shearwaters and mainland colonies
   of sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus indicated that small colonies
   suffered higher predation and lower breeding success than large
   colonies, demonstrating that predation in these two species is inversely
   density dependent and explaining the low predation rates observed in the
   very large Hutton's shearwater colonies. The presence of another
   introduced predator, feral pigs Sits scrofa, within six extinct colonies
   of Hutton's shearwaters and at the boundaries of the two extant
   colonies, strongly suggests that this species was responsible for the
   historic contraction in breeding range. Controlling stoats within the
   two remaining colonies is unlikely to assist in the conservation of
   Hutton's shearwater. Conservation efforts would be better spent
   protecting the two remaining colonies from pigs and in trying to
   establish new breeding sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Capsule Less than 32\% of counters record disturbance at their site,
   with differences in causes between coastal and inland sites. Aim Wetland
   Bird Survey (WeBS) data were reviewed to investigate the sources and
   scale of potential disturbance to waterbirds in the UK. Methods Between
   1995/96 and 1998/99, WeBS volunteer counters recorded human activity and
   perceived waterbird disturbance during co-ordinated counts at wetland
   sites across the UK. Results Over 68\% of counters recorded no
   disturbance at their site and only a small proportion of these (< 2\%)
   indicated very high levels. The frequency of disturbance peaked during
   the late summer. Just over 26\% of disturbance events were attributed to
   human activities. The most perceived human-related disturbance was
   caused by people using motor-driven machines and shooters. Coastal
   waterbirds were more likely to be disturbed by walkers, shooters and
   large aircraft whereas those inland were more likely to be disturbed by
   motor-driven machines and unpowered boats. Conclusions Volunteer-based
   surveys can be useful in monitoring the sources and distribution of
   potentially disturbing activities over large spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{In Nova Scotia, the whitemarked tussock moth, Orgyia leucostigma Fitch,
   periodically erupts in outbreaks that typically last 3-5 years.
   Population changes during a recent outbreak were monitored by means of
   aerial defoliation surveys and fall egg-mass surveys that were conducted
   between 1997 and 2001. Severe defoliation was first recorded on
   approximately 250 ha in 1996. The defoliated area increased rapidly to
   hundreds of thousands hectares in 1998, after which it sharply declined
   to about 4700 ha in 2000 and 0 ha in 2001. The total infested area
   {[}>0.01 egg masses per three branches of Abies balsamea L. (Pinaceae)]
   decreased from about 1.4 million ha in 1997 to about 13 500 ha in 2001.
   Between 1996 and 2001, the infestation involved a cumulative total of
   2.4 million ha, covering most of the province. The collapse of larval
   populations during 1998 was associated with widespread prevalence of a
   singly embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) and Entomophaga aulicae
   (Reichardt in Bail) Humber (Zygomycetes: Entomophthorales). Sampling of
   larval populations in late July and August 1998 revealed a widespread
   and virtually sympatric occurrence of those pathogens in areas that were
   under defoliation pressure, with infection levels by each pathogen
   exceeding 75\% in many sample sites. Pathogen impacts on larval survival
   were studied in 1999 in a persisting pocket of severe infestation in
   Hants County. Larvae were collected every 3 d from balsam fir branch
   samples between 17 June and 21 July and reared to determine cause of
   death. The two pathogens together accounted for at least 50\% of cohort
   mortality, calculated as marginal mortality rates according to Royama
   (2001). Although cohort mortality due to disease on balsam fir was
   significantly correlated with between-generation reduction in mean
   egg-mass density, overall pathogen-induced mortality was not high enough
   to drive the populations into an endemic state, and a moderate
   infestation persisted into 2000.}},

Abstract = {{Population dynamics of Glaucomys sabrinus (Shaw) and Tamiasciurus
   douglasii (Audubon and Bachman) were examined in commercially thinned
   and unthinned stands in British Columbia, Canada. We tested the
   hypothesis that commercial thinning would have negative short-term
   effects on the population dynamics of these species. Populations were
   monitored using mark-recapture techniques in two commercially thinned
   and two unthinned stands dominated by 60- to 70-year-old western hemlock
   (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata
   Donn. ex D. Don). Populations were sampled intensively from August 1995
   to May 1999 at Chehalis Lake and from May 1997 to March 2000 in the
   Malcolm Knapp Research Forest (MKRF). There were no differences among
   stands thinned and unthinned in movement, abundance, recruitment,
   survival, duration individuals remained in stands, percentage of males
   breeding, and mass of males for G. sabrinus or T. douglasii. Mean
   density of G. sabrinus in thinned and unthinned stands were 0.65 and
   0.89 individuals/ha, respectively, at Chehalis and 0.09 and 0.51
   individuals/ha, respectively, at MKRF. Mean density of T. douglasii in
   thinned and unthinned stands were 1.18 and 0.87 individuals/ha,
   respectively, at Chehalis and 1.08 and 1.00 individuals/ha,
   respectively, at MKRF. We concluded that commercial thinning had no
   negative short-term effects on the population dynamics of these species.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the degradation of carbazole (CAR) and
   2,3-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3-DCDD) in soils inoculated with
   carbazole- and dioxin-degrader Pseudomonas resinovorans strain CA10. By
   using Tn5-based transposon delivery systems, this bacterium was
   chromosomally marked with a tandem green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene.
   Real-time competitive PCR and direct counting using the (gfp) marker
   were employed to monitor the total number of carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase
   gene (carAa) and survival of CA10 cells in the soil and soil slurry
   microcosms. Bioaugmentation studies indicated that the survival of the
   marked CAM cells in soil microcosms was strongly influenced by pH and
   organic matter. While the number of the marked CA10 cells decreased
   rapidly in pH 6 with low organic matter, a high cell density was
   maintained in pH 7.3 with 2.5\% organic matters up to 21 days after
   inoculation. In pH 7.3 soil, the period needed for complete degradation
   of CAR (100 mugkg(-1)) was markedly shortened from 21 to 7 days by the
   inoculation with the CA10 cells. Single inoculation of CAM cells into
   the soil slurry system of 2,3-DCDD-contaminated soil enhanced the
   degradation of 2,3-DCDD from 25.0\% to 37.0\%. In this system, the
   population density of CAM cells and the total number of carAa gene were
   maintained up to 14 days after inoculation. By repeated inoculation
   (every 2 days) with CA10 cells each at a density of 10(9) CFU g(-1) of
   soil, almost all of the 2,3-DCDD (1 mug kg(-1)) was degraded within 14
   days. Results of these experiments suggest that P. resinovorans strain
   CA10 may be an important resource for bioremediation of CAR and
   chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin in contaminated soils. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fish are good indicators of the environmental health of rivers and their
   catchinents as well as important conservation targets. Bioindication has
   to be based on an understanding of the requirement of characteristic
   species with regard to: (a) The match/mismatch between reproductive
   strategies and environmental conditions. (b) The niche dimensions of
   critical stages vis-a-vis the key conditions. (c) The availability of
   microhabitats along the ontogenetic niche profiles, i.e. the
   connectivity from spawning substrates to early life history
   microhabitats. The main conditions for the embryonic period are
   temperature and oxygen supply which are responsible for embryonic
   mortality, the duration of the period, and size and condition of
   newly-hatched larvae. For the exogenously feeding larvae the functional
   of food acquisition, growth and bioenergetics to temperature, food
   availability and current velocity is decisive. Studies concentrated on
   Chondrostoma nasus, a target species for monitoring and conservation in
   large European river systems. Results obtained in experimental studies
   are compared with those from field studies in order to evaluate the
   match/mismatch between performances and microhabitat choice and
   population dynamics in the field. Discrepancies between requirements and
   field conditions in regulated rivers underline the significance of
   inshore zones as microhabitats (expressed in the `Inshore Retention
   Concept') and the requirement for ecophysiological studies on target
   species for river restoration and conservation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent analyses of the impact of cowbird parasitism on host productivity
   suggest that while parasitism reduces productivity on a per-nest basis,
   the ability of pairs to desert parasitized nests and renest allows them
   to achieve productivity comparable to that of unparasitized pairs. This
   has implications for the management of several endangered species that
   are highly vulnerable to parasitism and consequently the target of
   cowbird control programs. I calculated seasonal nesting effort (number
   of nests per pair) and productivity of 568 pairs of Least Bell's Vireos
   (Vireo bellii pusillus) monitored over 11 years at the San Luis Rey
   River in San Diego County, California (where cowbird trapping has
   reduced, but not eliminated, parasitism), assigning pairs to one of
   three groups: (1) deserters, (2) rescued (parasitized pairs with nests
   ``rescued{''} from probable failure by the removal of cowbird eggs), and
   (3) unparasitized. Parasitized pairs attempted significantly more nests
   per season than did unparasitized pairs, with deserters producing more
   nests than rescued pairs. However, productivity of deserting pairs was
   significantly lower than that of both rescued and unparasitized pairs,
   largely because subsequent nests of deserting pairs were also
   parasitized. Seasonal productivity of rescued and unparasitized pairs
   was comparable, indicating that in this species, reduction of cowbird
   impacts through nest manipulation to remove cowbird eggs is effective.
   Desertion by Least Bell's Vireos does not appear to be an adequate
   natural defense against parasitism, suggesting the need for continued
   cowbird control while vireo populations are re-established.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the incidence of structural and numerical chromosomal
   aberrations (CAs) in workers of a plantation of flowers located in
   Quito, Ecuador, in South America. This study included 41 individuals
   occupationally exposed to 27 pesticides, some of which are restricted in
   many countries and are classified as extremely toxic by the World Health
   Organization; among these are aldicarb and fenamiphos. The same number
   of individuals of the same age, sex, and geographic' area were selected
   as controls. Workers exposed to these pesticides showed an increased
   frequency of CA compared with control group (20.59\% vs. 2.73\%; p <
   0.001). We conclude that screening for CA is an adequate biomarker for
   evaluating and detecting genotoxicity resulting from exposure to
   pesticides. Levels of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were also
   determined as a complementary metabolic study. Levels below the optimal
   (> 28 U/mL blood) were found in 88\% of exposed individuals; this
   clearly shows the effect of organophosphate pesticides. When comparing
   the levels of acetylcholinesterase and structural CA frequencies, there
   was a negative linear correlation (r = 0.416; p < 0.01). We conclude
   that by using both analyses it may be possible to estimate damage
   produced by exposure to organophosphate pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{Depletion of vegetation by overgrazing in and environments has
   long-lasting effects on the environmental quality over extended
   geographic areas. An adequate inspection of habitat changes requires
   scaled up procedures that would allow assessing end-points of
   environmental status in broad areas that would be based on processes
   occurring at the plant canopy level. Our purpose was to find indicators
   of land degradation-conservation status for use in land monitoring
   programs and in planning management practices that would be amenable to
   further up-scaling for use with remotely sensed imagery. In several
   sites of the Patagonian Monte differing in the impact of grazing
   management, we evaluated vegetation attributes at three spatial scales.
   At the population scale, we found that the severity of grazing impact
   was characterized by the reduction of the palatable grass, P. ligularis,
   outside and inside shrub canopies. At the vegetation patch scale, we
   found that land degradation by domestic herbivore impact was
   characterized by changes in attributes of patch shape (radius, height,
   internal canopy cover) and patch abundance. At the plant community
   scale, we found that the structure of the plant canopy as described
   using Fourier analysis of cover data changed after long-term grazing
   impact consistently with the modifications in plant population and patch
   structures. We present a conceptual multiscale scenario of structural
   changes triggered by domestic herbivore impact, and quantitative
   indicators of plant structure and processes useful to develop management
   strategies of the Patagonian-Monte that would conserve its natural
   habitats. The developed end-points are also amenable for use in land
   conservation assessment through remotely sensed imagery.}},

Abstract = {{In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of
   Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States
   Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program
   to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed. The goals were
   to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities
   and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys,
   the 2790 km(2) watershed had 1570 km(2) of forest in 1997, 1080 km(2) of
   which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km(2)
   of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of
   the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the
   Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots
   designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody
   plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total
   of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of
   the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species
   composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher
   diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively
   forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody
   species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on
   species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals
   are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was
   clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas
   and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population
   of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4\% per year
   from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the
   watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas,
   including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2\% per year.
   There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no
   trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted.
   Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not
   indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation,
   rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy
   rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that
   large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and
   failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual
   deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are
   available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount
   of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result,
   dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a
   forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest
   areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of
   hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning
   population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades.
   Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control
   are necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To compare theoretical approaches towards estimating risks of plant
   species loss to anthropogenic climate change impacts in a biodiversity
   hotspot, and to develop a practical method to detect signs of climate
   change impacts on natural populations.
   Location The Fynbos biome of South Africa, within the Cape Floristic
   Kingdom.
   Methods Bioclimatic modelling was used to identify environmental limits
   for vegetation at both biome and species scale. For the biome as a
   whole, and for 330 species of the endemic family Proteaceae, tolerance
   limits were determined for five temperature and water
   availability-related parameters assumed critical for plant survival.
   Climate scenarios for 2050 generated by the general circulation models
   HadCM2 and CSM were interpolated for the region. Geographic Information
   Systems-based methods were used to map current and future modelled
   ranges of the biome and 330 selected species. In the biome-based
   approach, predictions of biome a real loss were overlayed with species
   richness data for the family Proteaceae to estimate extinction risk. In
   the species-based approach, predictions of range dislocation (no overlap
   between current range and future projected range) were used as an
   indicator of extinction risk. A method of identifying local populations
   imminently threatened by climate change-induced mortality is also
   described.
   Results A loss of Fynbos biome area of between 51\% and 65\% is
   projected by 2050 (depending on the climate scenario used), and roughly
   10\% of the endemic Proteaceae have ranges restricted to the area lost.
   Species range projections suggest that a third could suffer complete
   range dislocation by 2050, and only 5\% could retain more than two
   thirds of their range. Projected changes to individual species ranges
   could be sufficient to detect climate change impacts within ten years.
   Main conclusions The biome-level approach appears to underestimate the
   risk of species diversity loss from climate change impacts in the Fynbos
   Biome because many narrow range endemics suffer range dislocation
   throughout the biome, and not only in areas identified as biome
   contractions. We suggest that targeted vulnerable species could be
   monitored both for early warning signs of climate change and as
   empirical tests of predictions.}},

Title = {{A 20-year study on life-history traits of a harvested long-lived
   temperate coral in the NW Mediterranean: insights into conservation and

Abstract = {{1. Long-lived species play a paramount role in the structure and
   functioning of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The dramatic increase
   of human-induced disturbances may be irremediably affecting populations
   of long-lived species. Data on life-history traits on these species
   taking into account relevant temporal and spatial scales are very scarce
   for marine ecosystems, though these data are key to guarantee the
   conservation of these species and the communities that they shape.
   2. This study examined long-term data on life-history traits of the
   precious red coral (Corallium rubrum L., 1758) in the NW Mediterranean.
   This was performed by surveying the fate of 67 red coral colonies during
   21 years in a shallow-water habitat (27 m depth).
   3. Photographic monitoring provided data on survivorship, whole and
   partial mortality, recruitment and growth of colonies allowing about
   1000 observations on life-history traits.
   4. Red coral showed a high survivorship, 60\% of colonies reaching 22
   years of age. Whole mortality was significantly higher in juvenile
   colonies while partial mortality displayed the inverse pattern.
   Recruitment showed a pulse mode with a single peak at the beginning of
   the study and low rates thereafter. Average growth rates over the study
   period were extremely low: 0.24 +/- 0.05 mm year(-1) for the basal
   diameter, 1.78 +/- 0+/-7 mm year(-1) for colony height and 3.40 +/-
   0+/-31 branches in 22 years.
   5. This study also examined size-related effects of harvesting on red
   coral populations since shallow-water populations (between 10 and 40 m
   depth) have long been submitted to intensive harvesting.
   6. Measurements (basal diameter and height) of 400 colonies
   corresponding to the largest ones dwelling in 10 currently harvested and
   two non-harvested populations were compared to analyse the effects on
   the population's recovery and potential colonies' maximum sizes.
   Harvested populations showed values that were about twice as low on
   average and up to four times lower for maximum values in colony size
   than in the non-harvested populations.
   7. Our study provides indisputable data on the longevity of colonies and
   the parsimonious population dynamics of C. rubrum. Current populations
   have shown a dramatic shift in their size structures characterized by
   the absence of large colonies. Taking into account results obtained in
   this study full recovery time of shallow-water harvested populations may
   be measured by several decades or even centuries.}},

Abstract = {{Our objectives were to identify and field test the sex pheromone of
   female Douglas-fir cone gall midge, Contarinia oregonensis (Diptera:
   Cecidomyiidae). Coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic
   detection (GC-EAD) analyses of pheromone extract revealed a single
   compound (A) that elicited responses from male antennae. Hydrogenation
   of pheromone extract, followed by renewed GC-EAD analysis, revealed a
   new EAD-active compound with chromatographic characteristics identical
   to those of tridecan-2-yl acetate on five fused silica columns (DB-5,
   DB-210, DB-23, SP-1000, and Cyclodex-B). Syntheses, chromatography, and
   retention index calculations of all possible tridecen-2-yl acetates
   suggested that the candidate pheromone A was a tridecadien-2-yl acetate
   with nonconjugated double bonds. Synthetic candidate pheromone component
   (Z,Z)-4,7-tridecadien-2-yl acetate (Z4Z7) cochromatographed with A on
   all analytical columns and elicited comparable antennal activity. In
   GC-EAD analyses that separated the enantiomers
   (Z,Z)4,7-tridecadien-(S)-2-yl acetate (2S-Z4Z7) and
   (Z,Z)-4,7-tridecadien-(R)-2-yl acetate (2R-Z4Z7) with baseline
   resolution, only 2S-Z4Z7 as a component in a racemic standard or in
   pheromone extract elicited antennal responses. In Douglas-fir seed
   orchards, sticky traps baited with 2S-Z4Z7 captured male C. oregonensis,
   whereas 2R-Z4Z7 was behaviorally benign. Comparable catches of males in
   traps baited with racemic Z4Z7 (50 mug) or virgin female C. oregonensis
   suggested that synthetic pheromone baits could be developed for
   monitoring C. oregonensis populations in commercial Douglas-fir seed
   orchards.}},

Abstract = {{The maturity and reproductive cycle of female American lobsters (Homarus
   americanus) were investigated in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence
   (sGSL), Canada. The onset of sexual maturity of female lobsters can be
   established by observations of the ovarian condition, either color or
   weight, and staging of cement glands but cannot be detected by the
   morphometry of their abdomens. Females reached 50\% maturity between
   68.7 mm and 73.3 mm carapace length (L-C). There was a significant
   geographic difference (P < 0.005) in the size at 50\% maturity
   established by the ovarian development techniques but not by the
   cement-gland staging technique. Also, there were no annual significant
   differences (P > 0.005) between the ovarian development techniques used
   at a single site between 1994 and 1997. To study die reproductive cycle
   of females, molt stage, ovarian development, and egg spawning were
   monitored by dissections at the laboratory and by tagging studies in the
   field. The majority (80\%) of small mature females (L-C < 120 mm) in the
   sGSL had a typical two-year reproductive cycle with molting (with
   copulation) and spawning in alternating years. However, up to 20\% of
   multiparous females ranging between 65 mm and 109 mm L-C, could spawn in
   successive years instead of the generally accepted two-year cycle, and
   some could even molt and spawn during the same summer. Similarly, up to
   20\% of primiparous females could molt and spawn (for the first time) in
   the same year instead of spawning die following year. A small percentage
   (5\%) of small mature females could also skip molting or spawning for a
   year. Temperature data suggested that the length of the female
   reproductive cycle, and possibility of molting and spawning in the same
   year, were related to the number of dcgree-days in a particular season.}},

Abstract = {{Most urban growth in Canada occurs in the urban-rural fringe. The
   increasing dispersal of the Canadian urban population is due to
   centrifugal forces pulling urbanites past the suburbs into the
   surrounding exurban communities. Most Canadian urban centres are located
   on prime agricultural land. Exurban sprawl devours an inordinate amount
   of the better agricultural land. The growth around the city of Winnipeg
   is a case in point. Within Winnipeg's urban field are the rural
   municipalities of East and West St Paul. The objective of this study is
   to investigate the impact of urban growth on the agricultural land of
   these RMs as well as the rate of urban growth in both Municipalities
   based on database analysis using aerial photographs taken in 1960 and
   1989 and Geographic Information System (GIS). East St Paul was found to
   have a higher rate of urbanization (from 10(.)14\% to 43(.)75\%) between
   1960 and 1989 than West St Paul (from 7(.)36\% to 23(.)57\%). The growth
   prediction using Markov probability chain analysis showed that East St
   Paul will henceforth experience a reduced rate of increase than West St
   Paul. The rate of urbanization for both RMs is found to be comparable
   with areas surrounding other major cities such as Toronto. The largest
   increases in urban land use categories occurred in and around the
   existing exurban settlements. It was found that most urbanization take
   place on the most fertile soil. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {{A risk model for predicting the effects of lake-side development on

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{The lack of quantitative analysis and general scientific rigour in
   environmental impact assessment (EIA) is well documented. While reasons
   for this may include political and economic factors, the lack of
   high-level statistical knowledge and skills in environmental
   consultancies probably contributes to the problem, particularly with
   regard to ecological studies. This paper develops a simple model for
   wintering wildfowl populations that predicts different levels of risk
   from lake-side development. The aim was to create a model that could be
   used easily and quickly by consultants, is readily understandable for
   developers and various groups associated with the planning process, with
   explicit assumptions that can be criticised, and predictions that can be
   tested with post-development audits. The model is used in a case study.
   The basic parameters of the model are (i) average wildfowl abundance on
   lakes before development, (ii) maximum potential density of wildfowl
   across lakes (K-max) before development, and (iii) reduction in lake
   area suitable for wildfowl after development. The model includes
   abundance-area relationships that are useful for highlighting the
   importance of particular lakes at a site. In the case study,
   abundance-area relationships focused attention on two lakes with thick
   charophyte beds which supported higher than expected numbers of pochard
   and coot given their size. As well as being robust (confidence limits
   are calculated), the model's predictions are quantitative and testable,
   making it possible to compare the predictions with on-going
   post-development monitoring of wildfowl population levels. The
   predictions rely on the effectiveness of path screening, and
   post-development monitoring can suggest where screening should be
   strengthened if the model's predictions are not met. Similarly, if other
   assumptions in the model are not met by the development, appropriate
   action can be implemented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper examines the link between the ambient level of particulate
   pollution and subsequent human health effects and various sources of
   uncertainty when total exposure is taken into consideration. The
   exposure simulation model statistically simulates daily personal total
   exposure to ambient PM and nonambient PM generated from indoor sources.
   It incorporates outdoor-indoor penetration of PM, contributions of PM
   from indoor sources, and time-activity patterns for target groups of the
   population. The model is illustrated for Los Angeles County using recent
   1997 monitoring data for both PM10 and PM2.5. The results indicate that,
   on average, outdoor-source PM contributes about 20-25\% of the total PM
   exposure to Los Angeles County individuals not exposed to environmental
   tobacco smoking (ETS), and about 15\% for those who are exposed to ETS.
   The model computes both the fractional contribution of outdoor
   concentrations to total exposure and the effect of exposure
   uncertainties on the estimated slope of the (linear)
   concentration-response curve in time-series studies for PM health
   effects. The. latter considers the effects of measurement and
   misclassification error on PM epidemiological time-series studies. The
   paper compares the predictions of a conventional PM epidemiological
   model, based solely on ambient concentration measurements at a central
   monitoring station, and an exposure simulation model, which considers
   the quantitative relationship between central - monitoring PM
   concentrations and total individual exposures to particulate matter. The
   results show that the effects of adjusting from outdoor concentrations
   to personal exposures and correcting dose-response bias are nearly
   equal, so that roughly the same premature mortalities associated with
   short-term exposure to both ambient PM2.5 and PM10 in Los Angeles County
   are predicted with both models. The uncertainty in the slope of the
   concentration-response curve in the time - series studies is the single
   most important source of uncertainty in both the ambient - and the
   exposure-health model.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly (April to November) hydroacoustic surveys and parallel gillnet
   catches were used to determine vendace Coregonus albula abundance,
   biomass and population dynamics in a deep oligotrophic lake. By
   hydroacoustic surveys, recruitment of 0+ year vendace could clearly be
   detected. In contrast, gillnet catches resulted in low numbers of 0+
   year fish, and similarly under-represented proportions of the oldest
   vendace. Consequently, the correlation between hydroacoustics and
   gillnets with respect to fish numbers and geometric mean fish total
   length was high only for the age groups 1+ to 4+ years. Annual
   variability in hydroacoustic estimates of fish abundance and biomass was
   high (CV = 26-29\%) which reflects the seasonal population dynamics of
   vendace. (C) 2002 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles. Published

Abstract = {{Subject selection for studies investigating environmental chemicals in
   human milk requires thoughtful consideration of multiple factors.
   Studies often need to produce generalizable and representative data that
   can be compared to other similar studies. Goals of the study determine
   the selection of subjects. Exposure is only one factor that influences
   the levels of environmental chemicals in human milk. Many maternal and
   infant characteristics should be considered in subject selection.
   Collection procedures of human milk samples also affect subject
   selection, as subject burden may be enough to reduce compliance with the
   collection protocols. Decisions must be made about pooling of samples
   both within subjects and within populations. Guidelines for subject
   selection are provided by the World Health Organization for human milk
   monitoring, but distinct differences in the lactational practices,
   geography, and ethnic and racial diversity of the U. S. population
   require somewhat different approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of environmental chemicals in human milk have been carried out
   in many countries, but few have been conducted in the United States.
   These studies are useful for monitoring population trends in exposure to
   chemicals, for research into the determinants of environmental chemicals
   in milk and relationships between the levels found and the health status
   of the women and their infants, and for risk assessment. This article
   provides practical advice on data and information reporting for such
   studies. Participation in these studies comes at a difficult time for
   the breast-feeding mothers, so it is important that the mothers support
   the study and its goals. A key goal of any study of environmental
   chemicals in human milk must be to ensure that the breast-feeding
   process is not disrupted by unwarranted concerns about harm to the
   infant from chemicals in human milk. Therefore, it is essential that
   reporting of information be a two-way process. Information needs to be
   supplied to participating mothers before, during, and after their
   participation in the study. Information supplied before participation is
   necessary to satisfy the ethical requirement for informed consent;
   information supplied during participation includes advice on expressing,
   collecting, and storing milk samples, and how to avoid sample
   contamination; and information supplied to each participant at the end
   of the study includes a report of their individual results and a summary
   of study results and outcomes generally. The key instrument for
   obtaining data from the participants is the study questionnaire. This
   needs to be prepared in accordance with principles of good questionnaire
   development, and preferably should be interviewer administered. The
   questionnaire content will vary according to the objectives of the
   study. Although studies of environmental chemicals in human milk are
   logistically complex and demanding, they are practicable and, with
   careful planning and execution, yield important data.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to analyse the phenological variation of a
   residual invasive semi-evergreen shrub in Sahelian fallows in Niger.
   This species, Guiera senegalensis (Combretaccae), has benefited from the
   elimination of other species thanks to its high resistance to the
   increasing cutting pressure for cultivation. We sought to identify
   traits of its life cycle that could contribute to its persistence and
   widespread dominance under such a disturbance regime. Leafing, flowering
   and fruiting were monitored on seven fallows differing in topographic
   location, age, shrub density and degradation state, during two rainy
   seasons and one dry season. Phenological spectra showed similar timing
   of the three phenophases of the seven populations. Differences were
   observed mainly in magnitude of the phases. However, there were both a
   high intra-fallow variability (64.6\% of the whole variability) and a
   statistically significant inter-fallow variability, despite only 35.4\%
   of the total variability being due to differences between fallows. A
   statistical classification of the fallows was proposed based on shrub
   phenological course over the two cycles monitored. This classification
   corresponds to a gradient of life-cycle achievement primarily linked to
   the topographic situation of the stations, and then to a combination of
   other factors. The flexibility of the phenology at the individual,
   population and metapopulation scales, inherent to its specific
   semi-evergreenness property, appeared as an essential phenological
   attribute contributing to successful widespread persistence of G.
   senegalensis in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{Saugeyes, a purposeful hybrid between walleye Stizostedion vitreum and
   sauger S. canadense, were introduced into 336-ha Richmond Lake, South
   Dakota, with a management objective of improving the size structure of
   the population of black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus. The objectives
   of this study were to determine (1) the influence of stocking size on
   the relative survival of saugeyes, (2) changes in the black crappie
   population that were potentially associated with the saugeye
   introduction, and (3) the incidence of black crappies in the diet of
   saugeyes. Saugeyes were stocked at a total length of 3-4 cm in 1992 and
   1993; survival was low. Larger, 14-25-cm saugeyes were stocked annually
   from 1994 to 1998, and survival was significantly greater. The larger
   fingerlings were able to survive and establish a population in the face
   of predation by and competition with black crappies. Black crappie
   growth rates increased significantly after the saugeye population was
   established. Before the saugeye introduction program, a 20-cm black
   crappie typically grew less than 25 mm over a year, but by 1999 this had
   increased to 70 mm. As a result, black crappie size structure increased
   significantly. Before the saugeye introduction, few black crappies
   exceeded 25 cm total length, whereas 25-cm and longer fish were common
   by 1998 and 1999. Saugeye food habits were monitored seasonally at
   Richmond Lake during 1998. Saugeyes in all length-groups consumed age-0
   black crappies during all sampling periods except in early spring, when
   age-0 fishes were not yet available. Larger (>20 cm) black crappies were
   not observed in saugeye stomachs during our study. Thus, the saugeyes in
   Richmond Lake probably reduced the abundance and intraspecific
   competition of small black crappies, which resulted in increased growth
   and improved size structure for crappies.}},

Abstract = {{An exclosure experiment was carried out in the reed-dominated littoral
   zone of a volcanic lake (Lake Vico, central Italy) to test whether the
   impact of predatory fish on benthic invertebrates cascades on fungal
   colonisation and breakdown of leaf detritus. The abundance, biomass, and
   Shannon diversity index of the invertebrate assemblage colonising
   Phragmites australis leaf packs placed inside: (1) full-exclosure cages,
   (2) cages allowing access only to small-sized fish predators, and (3)
   cageless controls, were monitored over a 45-day period together with the
   mass loss and associated fungal biomass of leaf packs. The species
   composition of the fungal assemblage was further assessed at the end of
   the manipulation. In general, invertebrate predators did not show any
   significant response to fish exclusion., either on atrophic guild or on
   a single taxon level. In contrast, the exclusion of large predatory fish
   induced a diverse spectrum of changes in the abundance and population
   size-structure of dominant detritivore taxa, ultimately increasing the
   biomass and Shannon diversity index of the whole detritivorous guild.
   These changes corresponded with significant variations in leaf detritus
   decay rates as well as in the biomass and assemblage structure of
   associated fungal colonisers. Our experimental findings provide evidence
   that in Lake Vico effects of fish predators on invertebrate detritivores
   influence the fungal conditioning and breakdown of the detrital
   substrate. We conclude that in lacustrine littoral zones predator-driven
   constraints may structure lower trophic levels of detritus-based food
   webs and affect the decomposition of leaf detritus originated from the
   riparian vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{We studied habitat selection and foraging behaviour of the house mouse
   (Mus domesticus) related to increasing mouse densities and depleting
   food resources over the breeding season. The study was conducted during
   the increase phase of an incipient outbreak of mice in a grain-growing
   area of southeastern Australia. A 3-year rotation created a mosaic of
   large paddocks of grain crop, pasture, and fallow. The narrow fence
   lines between paddocks provide an important stable habitat for the mice.
   We monitored population densities with live-trapping and habitat
   preference by measuring giving-up densities (GUD) using artificial food
   patches. Food patches were established in crop fields, fence lines, and
   pasture. Avian predation risk was assessed by daily counts of raptors.
   Before harvest most mice were found in the crop fields. Fewer mice were
   found along the fence lines and no mice were found in the pasture. After
   harvest, the number of mice increased along the fence line and in the
   pasture. Mice started to exploit pasture but only a few trays were
   visited. As the population densities of mice increased, they inhabited
   all habitats. Feeding activity in the pasture remained low due to high
   predation risk. Along fence lines feeding activity increased and mice
   exploited open and covered patches similarly. We conclude that during
   high densities mice experience a strong trade-off between food and
   safety. Vegetation along fence lines offered cover but little food.
   However, soon after harvest this habitat was favoured by mice. Pasture
   offered little food and was an extremely risky habitat because of the
   lack of cover. We suggest that during high densities of mice, habitat
   use became more opportunistic. Mice took greater risks in all habitats
   and within each habitat at the microhabitat level. The ``Stalingrad
   effect{''} is a good descriptor of foraging decisions of mice during the
   progression of an incipient plague in the cereal-growing regions of
   southeastern Australia.}},

Abstract = {{In the Goulbum River, located in Victoria (Australia), dams and
   diversions for irrigation have modified streamflows and water
   temperature, and contributed to environmental degradation that includes
   declining native fish populations.
   With the passage of a new Water Act in 1989, the Victorian Government
   proposed to address environmental and water allocation issues through
   the development of tradeable water entitlements. Initially, these had a
   strong environmental focus and were to be allocated within an adaptive
   management framework that involved monitoring and evaluation to refine
   the total allowable diversion to sustainable levels. The actual
   specification of tradeable water entitlements for the Goulbum River,
   undertaken in 1995, differed substantially from those early proposals.
   Entitlements were largely based on historical use with limited and
   ineffective allocation of water to the environment because water
   temperature was not considered. A water market has been established but
   market failure is likely to result in an under-allocation of water to
   the environment. Access to the market is restricted except to irrigation

Abstract = {{Traffic is the main source of platinum-group element (PGE) contamination
   in populated urban areas. There is increasing concern about the
   hazardous effects of these new pollutants for people and for other
   living organisms in these areas. Airborne and road dusts, as well as
   tree bark and grass samples were collected at locations in the European
   cities of Goteborg (Sweden), Madrid (Spain), Rome (Italy), Munich
   (Germany), Sheffield and London (UK). Today, in spite of the large
   number of parameters that can influence the airborne PGE content, the
   results obtained so far indicate significantly higher PGE levels at
   traffic sites compared with the rural or non-polluted zones that have
   been investigated (background levels). The average Pt content in
   airborne particles found in downtown Madrid, Goteborg and Rome is in the
   range 7.3-13.1 pg m(-3). The ring roads of these cities have values in
   the range 4.1-17.7 pg m(-3). In Munich, a lower Pt content was found in
   airborne particles (4.1 pg m(-3)). The same tendency has been noted for
   downtown Rh, with contents in the range 2.2-2.8 pg m(-3), and in the
   range 0.8-3.0 and 0.3 pg m(-3) for motorway margins in Munich. The
   combined results obtained using a wide-range airborne classifier (WRAC)
   collector and a PM-10 or virtual impactor show that Pt is associated
   with particles for a wide range of diameters. The smaller the particle
   size, the lower the Pt concentration. However, in particles <PM-10, some
   of the highest values correspond to the fraction <0.39 mum. Considering
   an average Pt content in all particles of approximately 15 pg m(-3),
   which is representative for all countries and environmental conditions,
   the tracheobronchial fraction represents approximately 10\% and the
   alveolar fraction approximately 8\% of the total particles suspended in
   air. However, from the environmental risk point of view, an exposure to
   PGEs in traffic-related ambient air is at least three orders of
   magnitude below the levels for which adverse health effects might
   theoretically occur (of approx. 100 ng m(-3)). Therefore, today
   inhalation exposure to PGEs from automotive catalysts does not seem to
   pose a direct health risk to the general population. Even though the
   data available today indicate no obvious health effects, there are still
   a number of aspects related to PGEs and catalysts that justify further
   research. First, continual monitoring of changes in PGE levels in air
   and road dust is warranted, to make sure that there is no dramatic
   increase from today's levels. Secondly, more detailed information on the
   chemical composition of the PGE-containing substances or complexes
   leaving the catalyst surface and the size distribution of the
   PGE-containing particles released during driving will facilitate a more
   in-depth human risk assessment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper compares two methods of enumerating the redds of chinook
   salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and their application to the monitoring
   of spawning activity. In 1994 and 1995, aerial photographs of fall
   chinook salmon spawning areas in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River
   were digitized and mapped by means of geographical information systems
   techniques as part of annual population assessments. The numbers of
   redds visible in these photographs were compared with the counts
   obtained from visual surveys made from fixed-wing aircraft. The
   proportions of the total redds in each of five general survey areas were
   similar for the two enumeration techniques. However, the total number of
   redds based on aerial photographs was 2.2 times as high as that observed
   visually in 1994 and 3.0 times as high in 1995. The divergence in redd
   counts was most evident near the time of peak spawning activity, when
   the number of redds in individual spawning clusters exceeded 500. Aerial
   photography thus improved our ability to determine the number of visible
   salmon redds and to quantify habitat use.}},

Abstract = {{Autogamy in Paramecium tetraurelia is a form of sexual reproduction in a
   single cell that results in homozygosity in every genetic locus.
   Autogamy becomes inducible by natural starvation several fissions after
   the previous autogamy, and percent autogamy increases gradually with
   clonal age to reach 100\%. We here report the degree of variability of
   the autogamy-maturation pattern, and how it is inherited through
   autogamous generations. We assessed the autogamy-maturation pattern by
   monitoring percent autogamy at the ages of 9, 18 and 27 fissions in the
   wild-type stock 51. To determine how the autogamy-maturation pattern is
   inherited, clones that showed the lowest and the highest percent
   autogamy at age 18 in a given autogamous generation (Gn) were examined
   for their percent autogamy in the next autogamous generation (Gn+1).
   This procedure was repeated through successive autogamous generations.
   We found that percent autogamy at ages 9 and 27 was rather stable (low
   and high, respectively), while it was extremely variable at age 18
   ranging from 3\% to 100\%. We also found that percent autogamy at age 18
   in the progeny clones was variable irrespective of percent autogamy at
   age 18 in the parental clones; there was no regular rule such as
   producing progeny with higher (or lower) percent autogamy from parents
   with lower (or higher) percent autogamy.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the mechanism of certification to encourage sustainable
   harvesting and best management practices of Iriartea deltoidea Ruiz and
   Pavon, in the context of current land use and agricultural management in
   Amazonian Ecuador. Interviews and observations with harvesters,
   storeowners, and furniture-makers provided information about current and
   potential markets for goods made from the palm. To understand the
   demographic variables that are critical for population stability, data
   from five plots in each of three different forest types (mature,
   secondary, and dissected) were collected. Matrix models were used to
   develop harvesting simulations through which biological constraints on
   sustainable harvesting were explored. These simulations suggest that
   sparing individuals 5-15 m tall when pastures are cleared and adding
   this palm to current agroforestry polycultures can improve the
   likelihood of sustainable harvesting for this species. Results showed
   that harvesting Iriartea could fit within current land use. Some forest
   colonists clear pastures to graze cattle, while others devote land to
   agriculture, including polycultures of annuals and perennials. In either
   case, palms can be left standing when forests are cleared. Swidden
   agriculture (slash and burn or slash and mulch) depends on a fallow
   period during which secondary forest may begin to regenerate. These
   secondary forests are ideal locations for extraction of forest products
   that fit within the cycle of fallow regeneration in areas near human
   settlements. Sparing Iriartea individuals 5-15 m tall could benefit
   agriculture, encourage the sustainability of future harvests, and help
   ensure the future of this palm as a part of the Amazonian landscape.
   Interviews with staff of governmental and non-governmental conservation
   organizations investigated the policy context for certification as a
   mechanism for conservation. Establishing guidelines for harvesting
   requires input from all stakeholders in the decision, not simply an
   ecological analysis. Such guidelines for certifying good management
   practices, if they are developed, should include provisions for
   monitoring unanticipated consequences of harvesting or changes in future
   environmental conditions. Transportation issues and stem drying
   processes need to be addressed if efforts to expand markets are to
   succeed. More generally, guidelines for management of forest resources
   can be improved by combining ecological and social research
   perspectives; the potential for carrying out such guidelines can be
   improved by incorporating the knowledge of local forest dwellers and
   NGOs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lead contents in hair, whole blood and saliva were determined for 245
   healthy children (121 male, 124 female, age: 8-10 years) from three
   residential areas of Dusseldorf (North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) with
   different traffic densities. The geometric mean for the lead content in
   hair was found to be 0.87 mug/g (range: 0.2-9.9 mug/g) for the entire
   test group. While the levels of lead in hair in the suburban population
   were significantly lower than in the two city centre populations, no
   significant difference concerning the lead content in hair could be
   detected in the latter. The geometric mean for lead concentration in
   whole blood amounted to 25.0 mug/l (range: 8.0-154 mug/l). There was no
   significant difference between the sub-groups. The lead concentrations
   found in saliva were rather low (range: < 1.5-47.0 mug/l). Of the
   values, 89\% were below the detection limit of 1.5 mug/l. Due to reduced
   levels of lead in fuel, the present study exposes that the amount of
   lead in the children examined has further decreased compared to
   preceding surveys. The correlation between the lead content in hair and
   the road traffic density was not corroborated by the findings with
   regard to amounts of lead found in blood, indicating that residual lead
   from fuel does not result in a substantial burden of lead found in the
   whole body. In contrast to levels of lead found in blood, levels of lead
   found in hair may be influenced more by environmental conditions. Saliva
   is not a suitable material for biological monitoring with respect to
   lead exposure in children. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Several studies among adult populations showed that an array of outdoor
   and indoor sources of particles emissions contributed to personal
   exposures to atmospheric particles, with tobacco smoke playing a
   prominent role (J. Expo. Anal. Environ. Epidemiol. 6 (1996) 57, Environ.
   Int. 24 (1998) 405, Arch. Environ. Health 54 (1999) 95). The Vesta study
   was carried out to assess the role of exposure to traffic emissions in
   the development of childhood asthma. In this paper, we present data on
   68 children aged 8-14 years, living in the metropolitan areas of Paris
   (n= 30), Grenoble (n = 15) and Toulouse (n = 23), France, who
   continuously carried, over 48 h, a rucksack that contained an active
   PM2.5 sampler. Data about home indoor sources were collected by
   questionnaires. In parallel, daily concentrations of PM 10 in ambient
   air were monitored by local air quality networks. The contribution of
   indoor and outdoor factors to personal exposures was assessed using
   multiple linear regression models. Average personal exposure across all
   children was 23.7 mug/m(3) (S.D.= 19.0 mug/m(3)), with local means
   ranging from 18.2 to 29.4 mug/m(3). The final model explains 36\% of the
   total between-subjects variance, with environmental tobacco smoke
   contributing for more than a third to this variability; presence of pets
   at home, proximity of the home to urban traffic emissions, and
   concomitant PM10 ambient air concentrations were the other main
   determinants of personal exposure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Temporal and demographic aspects of the growth of Botrychium
   gallicomontanum and B. mormo were studied for 2 yr. A total of 219 B.
   gallicomontanum and 412 B. mormo plants were monitored in a prairie and
   maple-basswood forest, respectively. Growth e,vents were divided into
   four stages: leaf emergence, leaf separation, spore release, and
   senescence. Botrychium gallicomontanum emerged in April. peaked during
   the first week of June, and declined rapidly. The largest plants were
   found in late June and early July with a mean peak trophophore size of
   4.0 +/- 1.8 cm. Botrychium mormo emerged in June, and the population
   size peaked in early July. The largest plants occurred late in August
   with a mean peak trophophore size of 3.0 +/- 1.1 cm. The mean season
   span, or period of emergence aboveground annually, for B.
   gallicomontanum and B. mormo was 7.7 +/- 2.4 and 11.9 +/- 3.5 wk.
   respectively. Late-emerging plants produced spores in shorter periods.
   The separation stage was prolonged in B. gallicomontanum plants, whereas
   B. mormo plants had a much longer separation stage. Phenological
   differences are related to different habitat parameters of grassland and
   forest. Understanding the phenology of these rare species will help us
   more accurately predict the impact of management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Apart from its traditionally considered objective impacts on health, air
   pollution can also have perceived effects, such as annoyance. The
   psychological effects of air pollution may often be more important to
   well-being than the biophysical effects. Health effects of perceived
   annoyance from air pollution are so far unknown. More knowledge of air
   pollution annoyance levels, determinants and also associations with
   different air pollution components is needed. In the European air
   pollution exposure study, EXPOLIS, the air pollution annoyance as
   perceived at home, workplace and in traffic were surveyed among other
   study objectives. Overall 1736 randomly drawn 25-55-yr-old subjects
   participated in six cities (Athens, Basel, Milan, Oxford, Prague and
   Helsinki). Levels and predictors of individual perceived annoyances from
   air pollution were assessed. Instead of the usual air pollution
   concentrations at fixed monitoring sites, this paper compares the
   measured micro environment concentrations and personal exposures of
   PM2.5 and NO2 to the perceived annoyance levels. A considerable
   proportion of the adults surveyed was annoyed by air pollution. Female
   gender, self-reported respiratory symptoms, downtown living and
   self-reported sensitivity to air pollution were directly associated with
   high air pollution annoyance score while in traffic, but smoking status,
   age or education level were not significantly associated. Population
   level annoyance averages correlated with the city average exposure
   levels of PM2.5 and NO2. A high correlation was observed between the
   personal 48-h PM1.5 exposure and perceived annoyance at home as well as
   between the mean annoyance at work and both the average work indoor
   PM2.5 and the personal work time PM2.5 exposure. With the other
   significant determinants (gender, city code, home location) and home
   outdoor levels the model explained 14\% (PM2.5) and 19\% (NO2) of the
   variation in perceived air pollution annoyance in traffic. Compared to
   Helsinki, in Basel and Prague the adult participants were more annoyed
   by air pollution while in traffic even after taking the current home
   outdoor PM2.5 and NO2 levels into account. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation has been implicated as a cause of population
   declines of several Neotropical migrant bird species. Fragmentation
   increases the amount of habitat edge, and reduced nesting success rates
   near forest edges are well documented in agricultural landscapes
   ({''}edge effects{''}). However, edge effects in predominantly forested
   landscapes, particularly those related to timber harvest, are poorly
   understood. This study examines nesting success of ground nesting birds
   in relation to clearcut edges in a forest-dominated landscape in
   north-central Minnesota. A total of 383 nests of seven species of ground
   nesting birds were found and monitored during 1992-1998. Ovenbird
   (Seiurus aurocapilus; n = 318) and Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus; n =
   44) nests composed the majority of the sample. Predation accounted for
   94\% of all nest failures. Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater)
   parasitism was low (1.8\% for all ground nests). Using proportional
   hazards regression, distance to nearest clearcut edge was the best
   predictor of nest failure. For all ground nests, nesting success was
   0.18 at 0-100 m, 0.39 at 101-500 m, and 0.52 at 501-954 m from nearest
   clearcut edge. Source-sink modeling indicated that distances less than
   or equal to100 m from clearcut edges were sink habitats for Ovenbirds
   (i.e. recruitment was lower than survival). These results provide strong
   evidence of a negative edge effect on ground nests, extending 100 m or
   more from clearcut edges in a forest-dominated area of north-central
   Minnesota.}},

Abstract = {{Despite continued interest in the relative roles of top-down (predation)
   and bottom-up (productivity) factors in structuring ecological
   communities, there have been few studies of diverse terrestrial
   arthropod systems. Top-down theory predicts that decreased predator
   populations will result in increased herbivore populations and reduced
   plant populations. Bottom-up theory predicts that a positive producer
   level response to nutrients will support greater herbivore and predator
   populations. Few studies simultaneously examine both theories. In the
   present study, the roles of predators and nutrients in structuring an
   Australian chenopod shrubland community were investigated, by using a
   complete 2 x 2 factorial design with three replicated plots with and
   without nutrients (fertilizer) and predators (two wolf spiders and two
   ants). Producer and major arthropod taxa responses, predator densities
   and soil nutrient levels were monitored from April 1996 to February
   1998. In agreement with bottom-up theory, the abundances of some plants
   and herbivores increased with the addition of nutrients, but most
   effects varied temporally and did not increase the abundances of any
   predator taxa. The effects of predator removal propagated down the food
   web to influence some herbivore and producer taxa but, in contrast to
   top-down theory, effects were temporally dependent and varied in the
   direction of response within each trophic level. Predators and nutrients
   only interacted significantly to determine the abundance of one taxon.
   The findings suggest that true trophic cascades are not a primary
   determinant of chenopod community structure, with `conditional trophic
   trickles' a better descriptor for the effects of predators and nutrients
   on this community. It is suggested that the expression of top-down and
   bottom-up effects is conditional on appropriate timing and extent of
   rainfall. The results provide further support for the theory that food
   webs are more complex in terrestrial than in aquatic systems, with
   abiotic and biotic heterogeneity, intraguild interactions and
   non-consumptive interactions between adjacent trophic levels all
   confounding the classic consumptive interactions that are required for
   the expression of top-down and bottom-up forces.}},

Abstract = {{Stephens' Banded Snakes (Hoplocephalus stephensii Krefft 1869) are large
   (to 1 m), highly arboreal elapid snakes, restricted to mesic forested
   areas along the eastern coast of Australia. Radiotelemetric monitoring
   of 16 individuals at Whian Whian State Forest in north-eastern New South
   Wales over 25 months provided the first data on spatial ecology of this
   threatened taxon. Two major influences on movements by Stephens' Banded
   Snakes were identified: the distribution of large hollow-bearing trees,
   and the avoidance of conspecifics. Radiotracked snakes were sedentary
   inside tree hollows for extended periods (mean = 8 days) during their
   active season, interrupted by occasional long (mean = 124 m) nocturnal
   movements to another shelter tree. Snakes travelled on the ground rather
   than within the canopy, and thus were potentially exposed to terrestrial
   predators. Although the home ranges of the radiotracked snakes
   overlapped substantially (mean = 27\%), simultaneous occupancy of
   `shared' shelter trees was less common than expected by chance. Hence,
   we conclude that adult Stephens' Banded Snakes generally avoid the
   presence of conspecifics. Snakes used from five to 30 shelter trees and
   home ranges of male snakes were larger than those of females (mean =
   20.2 vs 5.4 ha). The large spatial scale of these movements, and limited
   overlap among individuals, means that a viable population of this taxon
   requires a large area of contiguous forest. This requirement may explain
   why the species has not persisted in small forest fragments.}},

Title = {{The success of a soft-release reintroduction of the flightless Aldabra

Abstract = {{Humans and introduced mammalian predators have caused local extinctions
   and range reductions in the rallid genus Dryolimnas (endemic to western
   Indian Ocean islands); today two subspecies survive, one on Madagascar
   and one on three islands (ca. 8000 birds) of Aldabra Atoll. Domestic
   cats (Felis catus) still occur on Aldabra and their presence poses a
   significant potential threat to the rails. Reintroduction to cat-free
   islands would significantly improve their conservation status. In 1999,
   20 rails were captured and brought to now cat-free Picard Island (the
   third largest island of Aldabra Atoll). Two rails died in captivity but
   all 18 remaining birds were released and survived beyond the first
   breeding season. Eight pairs had bonded and bred Successfully within 2
   months of release, producing a minimum of 13 chicks. Eleven monitored
   pairs produced 20 chicks in 2000/2001, with 1-year-old birds breeding
   successfully. Average chick production was significantly higher in the
   reintroduced population than in the source population in both breeding
   seasons. The reintroduced population at the end of the 2001 breeding
   season was at least 51, an increase of 283\% in 18 months. Around 20
   pairs are expected to attempt breeding on Picard in the third season
   after reintroduction, with excellent prospects for continued,
   exponential population growth in the medium-term. The soft-release
   reintroduction protocol allowed monitoring of individual birds' health
   before release into the wild. This is believed to have played a crucial
   role in the success of the reintroduction by allowing individuals to
   acclimatise and providing additional energetic reserves for the period
   between release and self-sufficiency. A soft-release is recommended as
   the conservative and precautionary method of choice for avian
   reintroductions and translocations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The southern Iberian Peninsula is one of the most important refugia of
   Tertiary relict plant taxa in Europe. Under the present summer-dry
   climate, relict populations may experience a severely reduced
   regeneration. We studied the demographic structure, seed set and initial
   recruitment in relict populations of the endangered tree Frangula alnus
   subsp. baetica (Rhamnaceae) to evaluate its regeneration potential under
   the present environmental conditions. Populations are restricted to
   small riparian forests of Southwest Spanish and North Moroccan mountain
   ranges. The distribution of fruit crop sizes was highly left-skewed, and
   a few old trees produced the large bulk of the population seed pool.
   Bird-mediated seed dispersal appeared inefficient and post-dispersal
   seed predation by mice was high. Secondary seed transport by elevated
   creek water flow after winter rains modified the primary seed dispersal,
   but in consequence most seeds germinated on recently formed sandbanks
   where seedlings experienced reduced initial growth and survival. The
   most important mortality factor was desiccation, followed by herbivory.
   None of 1144 monitored seedlings survived for 2 years. The demographic
   survey through five populations indicates that drought periods may cause
   temporal regeneration bottlenecks. Moreover, over the last two decades
   populations have experienced increasing regeneration problems. Two
   causes are suggested: (1) browsing pressure from introduced game
   animals, and (2) the impact of torrential water flow peaks after heavy
   winter rains, exacerbated by large-scale vegetation slashing in
   surrounding cork oak forests. We discuss conservation strategies for
   this and other relict tree species that account for the pecularities of
   their habitat within the. Mediterranean. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   suppressive and the conducive soil were not significantly different as
   indicated by the number of males and cysts as well as by the number of
   eggs and second-stage juveniles within those cysts. However, after two
   beet cyst nematode generations (880 DD), the number of all monitored
   life stages were significantly lower in the suppressive soil than ill
   the conducive soil. The reproduction index of H. schachtii was 33.9 in
   conducive soil and 1.0 in suppressive soil. After each generation, the
   population of soil-dwelling second-stage juveniles was significantly
   smaller in suppressive than in conducive soil. After both generations,
   more than half the cysts in the suppressive soil were colonized by
   fungi, while less than 25\% of the cysts in the conducive soil were
   colonized. Egg parasitism was very low in conducive soil, and
   significantly more eggs were parasitized in suppressive soil after both
   nematode generations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights

Abstract = {{A field study was undertaken in Uganda using highland cooking banana
   (cv. Atwalira) to test the hypothesis that bananas grown under stressed
   conditions are more susceptible to attack by Cosmopolites sordidus
   (Germar). Four banana treatments were employed to create different
   levels of host-plant vitality: (1) high stress: intercrop with finger
   millet; (2) moderate stress: monoculture without soil amendments; (3)
   low stress: monoculture with manure; (4) high vigour: monoculture with
   continuous mulch and manure. Adult C. sordidus were released at the base
   of banana mats 11 months after planting and populations were monitored
   for three years using mark and recapture methods. Cosmopolites sordidus
   density was greatest in the mulched plots which may have reflected
   increased longevity and/or longer tenure time in moist soils. Lowest C.
   sordidus numbers were found in intercropped banana. Damage, estimated as
   percentage corm tissue consumed by larvae, was similar among treatments.
   However, the total amount of tissue consumed was greater in mulched
   banana than in other systems. Plants supporting the heaviest levels of
   C. sordidus damage displayed bunch size reductions of 40-55\%. Banana
   yield losses ranged from 14-20\% per plot with similar levels in the
   intercropped and mulched systems. Yield reductions, reported as t
   ha(-1), were twice as high in the mulched system as in the intercrop.
   The results from this study indicate that C. sordidus problems are not
   confined to stressed banana systems or those with low levels of
   management, but that the weevil can also attain pest status in
   well-managed and productive banana stands.}},

Abstract = {{During the last century, diatom production responses to increased
   phosphorus loading in Lake Michigan resulted in increased silica
   sedimentation losses and a consequent decline in the silica content of
   the lake. In light of recent reductions in phosphorus loading to the
   lake, we examined long-term monitoring data to determine if this trend
   might be reversing. Spring total phosphorus concentrations, although
   highly variable, declined approximately 1 mug.L-1 throughout the lake
   between 1983 and 2000. Spring soluble silica concentrations, an
   indicator of total in-lake reserves, increased from 1.1 to 1.6 mg.L-1
   during this period. Summer epilimnetic silica concentrations in the
   southern basin were at apparently limiting levels of approximately 0.15
   mg.L-1 until 1991 and then increased sharply. A similar trend was seen
   in the northern basin. Summer diatom populations increased in both
   basins after 1991, and ordination analyses suggest that the species
   composition of both spring and summer communities has responded to these
   silica increases. These results document for the first time a reversal
   of the silica depletion sequence and provide the most compelling
   evidence to date that phosphorus load reductions are having an impact on
   the Lake Michigan ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Measles virus (MV), a highly infective paramyxovirus, has caused
   sporadic epizootics characterized by high morbidity and increased
   mortality in nonhuman primates. Measles vaccines for human use, although
   effective, are cost prohibitive for use in primate colonies. We compared
   the efficacy of one or two doses of Vanguard D-M, a canine
   distemper-measles (CD-M) vaccine, with a single dose of Attenuvax, a
   human measles vaccine. Compared with 81\% of animals inoculated with
   Attenuvax, all animals inoculated with one or two doses of Vanguard
   developed detectable MV antibodies. One year after immunization, six
   juveniles from each vaccine group, along with three unvaccinated
   controls, were challenged with pathogenic MV and were monitored for
   clinical signs of disease, viremia, viral shedding, and immune response.
   All uninoculated controls developed clinical disease and viremia, and
   shed virus in nasopharangeal secretions. Subclinical viremia without
   viral shedding was identified in two Attenuvax- and two single-dose
   Vanguard-inoculated animals. Viremia was not detected in any two-dose
   Vanguard-inoculated animals. Significantly higher neutralization
   antibody titers Were observed in animals receiving Vanguard. Results of
   this study indicate that Vanguard is at least as efficacious as
   Attenuvax for protection of rhesus macaques. The considerably lower cost
   of Vanguard makes vaccination against measles in large breeding colonies
   economically feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Abalone populations have declined dramatically in southern California.
   The white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) is now (2001) on the federal
   endangered species list. To aid in the restoration of white, pink (H.
   corrugata), and green abalone (H. fulgens), productive marine protected
   areas need to be selected. We used spatially explicit fishery data
   (1950-1995) to identify the most productive marine areas in southern
   California. To assess the role of existing marine protected areas we
   compared fishery-independent data (1983-2001) inside protected and
   fished areas. San Clemente Island produced the greatest cumulative
   catches of white, pink, and green abalone, the most white abalone per
   hectare of deep reef (25-65 m), and the most green abalone per kilometer
   of rocky shoreline. Santa Barbara Island, however, produced 10 times
   more pink abalone per hectare of kelp canopy, making this area an
   excellent candidate for restoration and protection. Pink abalone
   surveyed in the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program were most abundant at
   three sites surrounding Anacapa Island: (1) protected, (2) protected but
   less visible, and (3) fished. The protected sites, despite having lower
   abundances of pink abalone initially (1983), had significantly more
   abalone (H=9.0; df=2; p=0.011) than the nearby fished site over time.
   Size-frequency distributions revealed that the protected site had more
   (30\%) commercial-size abalone (greater than or equal to158 mm shell
   length) than the less visable site (6\%) or the fished site (2\%). Mean
   size was significantly larger at the protected site, yielding the
   highest estimate of biomass and potential egg production (2555 million
   eggs/site/year) of all the sites. Marine protected areas need to be
   selected and enforced so that abalone-restoration efforts can be enacted
   before remnant populations die. Restoration sites for a wide variety of
   depleted species can be selected based on previous levels of
   productivity identified by spatially explicit data.}},

Abstract = {{1. The grasshopper Chorthippus brunneus has been shown to increase egg
   size with maternal age under constant laboratory conditions, such that
   late-laid eggs are larger than early laid eggs. In this study, an
   increase in the size of eggs (and hatchlings from those eggs) was
   recorded with date of oviposition in a field cage population. This
   suggests that the relationship between maternal age and egg size,
   observed previously in the laboratory, also occurs in the field. There
   was, however, some evidence that the behaviour of the maternal females
   in field cages was modified by the onset of autumnal weather at the end
   of the breeding season. Only a small number of eggs was laid in the last
   3 weeks of the summer but these yielded relatively small hatchlings.
   2. The date on which eggs were laid was correlated positively with their
   date of hatch in the following year. A consequence of this relationship,
   and that between oviposition date and egg size, was that size at hatch
   increased with date of hatch through most of the spring but then
   declined as the last few eggs hatched. Temporal variation in size at
   hatch parallelled temporal variation in the maternal females' investment
   in egg size in the previous year.
   3. An undisturbed field population was monitored to assess whether the
   temporal variation in size at hatch resulted in size variation at
   eclosion in subsequent developmental stages. There were negative
   correlations between size at eclosion and date of eclosion at the third
   and fourth instars, suggesting that despite their smaller size at hatch,
   early hatchers experienced more favourable conditions for juvenile
   growth than late hatchers. The larger size at hatch of late hatchers may
   enhance their survival and compensate (albeit incompletely) for their
   reduced opportunity for growth. Female reproductive behaviour may
   represent an adaptive response to a predictable seasonal decline in
   offspring fitness at hatch.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effects of climate change on vegetation are of increasing
   concern. In the Mediterranean region, the dominant impact of climate
   change is expected to be through the modification of water balance. In
   this paper we present a model developed to predict drought-induced
   mortality of woody plants under different climatic scenarios. The model
   is physiologically-based and simulates water transport within individual
   woody plants, which can be isolated or competing for a common water
   resource. The model assumes that plant mortality is controlled by the
   carbon balance: when the plant is unable to transport water to the
   leaves it ceases to acquire carbon and, if this situation lasts long
   enough, it can no longer survive. In the particular application that we
   report in this study, two evergreen species are compared, Quercus ilex
   and Phillyrea latifolia, which were very differently affected by the
   acute drought that occurred in E Spain in summer 1994. While in some Q.
   ilex populations the amount of individuals that dried completely was up
   to 80\%, P. latifolia showed almost no damage. During the years 1999 and
   2000, canopy transpiration was monitored using sap-flow sensors in
   individuals of these two species in a Holm-oak forest from NE Spain. A
   Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach was used
   to calibrate the model against sap-flow measurements. The only
   difference between species that was introduced `a priori' was that Q.
   ilex was more vulnerable to xylem embolism than P. latifolia (based on
   our own measurements in the study area). During the calibration process
   the information provided by the measured sap flows was used to retain
   the more likely parameter sets for each species. These parameter sets
   were used in all the following simulations. The model was able to
   accurately simulate transpiration dynamics of the two species in the
   study area. When the meteorological conditions of summer 1994 were
   introduced, the model outputs also reproduced the differential impact
   that drought had on the two species studied. In the simulations under
   climate change two factors were explored: the increase in mean
   temperature (+ 1.5, + 3 and + 4.5 degreesC) through its effect on ET,
   and the duration of summer drought. Under any of the scenarios,
   mortalities were much higher for Q. ilex: while this species was
   predicted to survive with less than 5\% mortality droughts of up to
   84-94 days, the mortality of P. latifolia reached 5\% between days 133
   and 150. For droughts longer than 3 months, which is approximately the
   current drought duration in the study area for dry years, the mortality
   of Q. ilex increased sharply. These results are discussed in relation to
   the possible long-term impacts of climate change on Q. ilex-dominated
   forests. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic nitrogen deposition may affect the long-term survival of plant
   Populations. The northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, is a model
   system for forecasting extinction risk in the face of increasing
   nitrogen deposition. Uptake of N occurs directly from pitcher leaves,
   which fill with rainwater and prey, and accumulate nutrients. We
   monitored the demography of two populations of S. purpurea in
   ombrotrophic bogs of northern New England (USA) and described population
   growth with a four-stage matrix model. Growth, survivorship, and
   reproduction were in close balance, and the model predicted population
   growth rates close to zero, with long doubling times. In a life-table
   response experiment, we manipulated in situ concentrations of nitrogen
   and phosphorus in pitcher plant leaves. At high levels of N and high N:P
   ratios, population growth rates were significantly depressed. Using
   local N-deposition records, we forecast different N-deposition scenarios
   and built a nonstationary population growth model, in which a different
   transition matrix at each time step reflected the current deposition
   regime. Autocorrelation in the time series of N deposition rates
   generated periodic increases in population size superimposed on
   long-term trends of exponential decline. For a 1\% annual increase in N
   deposition rates, this model predicted a substantial risk of extinction
   at 100 yr (0.38-0.70), with an estimated population survival time of
   160-180 yr. Although slow-growing populations of Sarracenia can buffer
   substantial environmental change, chronic increases in N deposition rate
   threaten population persistence.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of immature stages of the cranberry fruitworm,
   Acrobasis vacinii Riley, and cherry fruitworm, Grapholitha packardii
   Zeller was studied in Michigan blueberry farms. Single blueberry plants
   or individual clusters of fruit were compared as sampling units.
   Distributions of eggs and larvae at each sampling date were described by
   fitting data to either Poisson (random) or negative binomial
   (aggregated) distributions, and by calculating parameters of Taylor's
   power law. Additionally, two methods were used to calculate optimal
   sample sizes for use in future pest sampling. In one approach, Taylor's
   power law parameters were used to compute optimal sample sizes needed to
   estimate populations at two fixed-precision levels, 10 or 20\%. In
   another method, the minimum number of samples required to collect at
   least one insect in 95\% of samples was calculated. Results based on
   Taylor's power law parameters suggest that prohibitively large sample
   sizes would be required for even 20\% precision, whereas the other
   method required substantially fewer samples and may thus be of more
   practical value in a pest monitoring program. All insect populations
   varied between aggregated and random distributions over the season, but
   A. vaccinii eggs and larvae were more often aggregated than G.
   packardii. Analysis of within-field distribution of fruit worm
   populations showed that A. vaccinii eggs were significantly more
   abundant in blueberries closer to woods when populations were at their
   peak. The distribution of eggs suggests that adjacent wooded habitats,
   which often contain wild hosts of this insect, may provide a source for
   individuals that colonize commercial fields.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of soft-sediment infauna can be a useful tool in impact
   assessment, but sorting of specimens from sediments may be very time
   consuming and expensive. This can force a reduction in the intended
   sampling program, leading to low statistical power and increased
   uncertainty in decision making. We pooled field samples of marine
   infauna into composites, then exhaustively subsampled the composites to
   examine the statistical distribution of organisms in the subsamples.
   Abundances of organisms among subsamples were generally consistent with
   a random distribution, with deviations from randomness occurring more
   frequently for standard replicates than for subsamples. For the most
   abundant taxa, subsamples had much smaller variances than replicates,
   and in 76\% of cases, the type of sample (i.e., subsample or replicate)
   had no effect on the mean abundance of organisms recorded. As our
   subsamples appeared generally unbiased, we then considered the cost and
   power for hypothetical monitoring programs using an MBACI analysis, and
   found substantial cost savings and increases in power to detect impact
   by using compositing and subsampling.}},

Abstract = {{The amount of solid waste produced in Istanbul, the biggest city in
   Turkey with a population of 10,072,447 according to the 2000 census, is
   about 9,000 tons per day. The amount of organic substances is more than
   45\% and leads to the formation of high amounts of flammable and
   explosive solid waste gases accumulated in Istanbul land-fill sites.
   Because of their flammable and explosive properties, it is very
   important to monitor the level of emissions of these gases to ensure
   regulatory requirements are met. In this study the gas emission
   measurements of methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), oxygen (O-2), carbon
   monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are carried out in
   Kemer-burgaz-Odayeri solid waste landfill site, Istanbul. The emission
   average values measured were as follows: 5.2-37 vol\% for methane, 71.6
   - 100\% LEL (Lower Explosion Limit; 100\% LEL= 2.3vol\%) for acetylene,
   2.7-20.9 vol\% for oxygen, 9.6-145.8 ppm for carbon monoxide, and
   22.6-95 ppm for hydrogen sulfide. Methane and acetylene concentrations
   were in the explosively flammable range at landfill gas vents. Also,
   carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were remarkably high
   at the vents. The emission values of these landfill gases were compared
   with Turkey's criteria and international legal criteria.}},

Abstract = {{1. Non-directional asymmetries (fluctuating asymmetry, FA) from
   bilateral symmetry in morphological traits have been used as an
   indicator of environmental stress and may become an important diagnostic
   tool in environmental sciences, such as ecotoxicology.
   2. In this study the relationship was examined between wing feather
   asymmetry, measured as the difference between the length of the third
   primary on the left and right wing, and blood concentration of selected
   persistent organochlorines (OCs) in Arctic breeding Glaucous Gulls
   (Larus hyperboreus , Gunnerus).
   3. There was a positive relationship between primary asymmetry and blood
   concentrations of two PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) congeners (P <
   0.05), oxychlordane (P < 0.05), DDE (p `p
   `-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) (P < 0.05), and especially HCB
   (hexachlorbenzene) (P < 0.001). At HCB levels above 30 ng g(-1) (wet
   mass) there was a 60\% probability that the birds had asymmetric wing
   feathers.
   4. This study indicated that the present levels of organochlorines in
   the European Arctic are stressors for Glaucous Gulls, and that asymmetry
   measurements of wing feathers may be used as an indicator of both
   exposure and effects of such contaminants. FA may also be a promising
   measurement for monitoring the early effects of organochlorine pollution
   on bird populations.}},

   kelp beds located south of San Clemente, California, have been monitored
   on a semi-annual basis using diver observations, sidescan sonar, and
   downlooking sonar. Aerial photographs of the kelp-bed surface canopies
   have been recorded annually since 1968. Since 1981, studies have been
   intermittently performed on the Pendleton Artificial Reef. Ecological
   studies were also conducted pre- and post-1997-1998 El Nino and
   qualitatively from 1994 to 1999 at the Mission Beach Artificial Reef. El
   Nino events have been associated with catastrophic ecological conditions
   in the southern California nearshore zone that may have significant
   influence on both reef structure and reef community. The variation of
   kelp populations in the three natural kelp beds is reviewed relative to
   recent El Nino events, local wave climate, local sea surface
   temperatures, and regional precipitation. The local temperature and
   precipitation data show that El Nino periods have had varying and
   non-consistent effects with respect to kelp growth. Yet, periods of low
   kelp density appear to be related to extended periods of above normal
   sea surface temperatures and increased precipitation generally
   associated with El Nino events. Examination of artificial reef data from
   the standpoint of substrate and kelp persistence through the latest
   1997-1998 El Nino event revealed effects that are consistent with
   natural kelp bed information. The population dynamics of natural kelp
   beds through various El Nino periods indicate that the range of kelp
   density fluctuations over time on an artificial reef designed for kelp
   can be expected to be quite high.}},

   diazinon at different dilution rates, and oil combined with the
   pyrethroid esfenvalerate in a completely randomized block design. Higher
   volume diazinon applications (3750 and 1870 l ha(-1)) proved effective
   against SJS crawlers, as did esfenvalerate. The higher volume
   applications had greater deposition on Kromecoat(R) cards placed in the
   top of the tree canopy, where SJS is most abundant. The lower-volume
   (935 l ha(-1)) application of diazinon provided control of
   first-generation crawlers similar to the other diazinon applications,
   but it was generally less effective in controlling subsequent
   generations. All insecticide treatments were associated with a reduction
   of parasitoid numbers, especially the esfenvalerate application.}},

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that primate populations are limited by food
   resources, we studied the feeding ecology of three cercopithecines and
   one colobine in a rain forest in central Gabon. Simultaneously, we
   monitored the fruiting phenology of trees and estimated the biomass of
   the monkey community. The Makande Forest is dominated by Caesalpiniaceae
   and characterized by a lack of secondary vegetation and of trees species
   producing fleshy fruits. Fruit production was irregular intra- and
   interannually. Fruiting peaks of dry fruits (mainly Caesalpiniaceae) and
   of fleshy fruits occurred at the same period. However, interseasonal and
   interannual variability was greater in Caesalpiniaceae than in other
   families. As a result, the Makande forest is subject to bottlenecks when
   food is scarce. On an annual basis, seeds (primarily Caesalpiniaceae)
   dominated the diet of all monkeys. On a seasonal basis, cercopithecines
   preferentially consumed fleshy fruits as long as they were available,
   whereas colobines increased consumption of young leaves when seed
   availability declined. The consumption of mature leaves was low. The
   monkey community biomass (ca. 204 kg/km(2)) is one of the lowest in
   Central Africa. We suggest that both cercopithecine and colobine
   populations are limited as a result of the combined effect of the
   dominance of Caesalpiniaceae, which provide dry fruits according to a
   mast-fruiting pattern and mature leaves of low quality, and the lack of
   seral successional stages, which provide fleshy fruit on a more regular
   pattern and leaves of better quality. During the period of food
   scarcity, cercopithecines should suffer from the low availability of
   fleshy fruit, which are their favorite food. At the same period,
   colobines should be limited by the low availability of edible leaves.
   Similar low primate biomasses are found in forests dominated by
   Caesalpiniaceae or Lecythidaceae in South America and in
   Dipterocarpaceae forests in South Asia, which suggests that their
   biological characteristics, in particular dry fruits and mast fruiting,
   are unfavorable to monkey populations. Our results confirm that habitat
   mosaics may support larger populations of primary consumers than
   homogeneous primary forests can.}},

Abstract = {{1. The maintenance or modification of grazing regimes is frequently
   advocated to deliver conservation targets in pastoral landscapes, but
   there are few quantitative studies of the effects of grazing on upland
   birds. This is particularly true with respect to grazing management in
   agri-environment schemes.
   2. Numbers of black grouse Tetrao tetrix and their breeding success were
   therefore monitored at 20 sites in the north of England from 1996 to
   2000. Ten treatment sites included areas where grazing was reduced
   before and during the study to < 1.1 sheep ha(-1) in summer and < 0.5
   sheep ha(-1) in winter. Each was paired with a reference site that held
   sheep at two (summer) to three times (winter) the density on the
   experimental sites. The reduced grazing sites ranged from 0.4 to 3.2
   km(2) in size and most were part of existing agreements within
   agri-environment schemes that had been in place for 1-5 years before
   1996.
   3. Numbers of black grouse males displaying increased by an average of
   4.6\% (SE = 2.1) year(-1) at the 10 sites with reduced grazing.
   Displaying male trends differed significantly between treatment and
   normally grazed reference sites, where numbers declined annually on
   average by 1.7\% (SE = 1.4).
   4. Summer black grouse hen densities showed the greatest rate of
   increase where grazing was restricted on smaller areas of ground (0.4
   km(2)). Declines occurred at sites where the area of restricted grazing
   exceeded about 1 km(2). The rates of change in population density, as
   indicated by numbers of displaying males, peaked in the early years of
   grazing reduction and then declined after c. 5-7 years.
   5. The proportion of females that retained broods during the late
   chick-rearing period was 54\% (SE = 0.06) at sites with reduced grazing,
   significantly greater than the 32\% (SE = 0.06) at normally grazed
   reference sites. There was no difference in the size of broods between
   grazing treatments.
   6. This study demonstrates that agri-environment schemes, which
   encourage extensive management of grazing land, can benefit at least
   some organisms of conservation importance and lead to some recovery of
   populations. There is a need, however, for further understanding of how
   such benefits can be maintained at a landscape scale and over the
   greater time scales involved in vegetation dynamics and bird population
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{A portable, low-frequency acoustic system was used to detect termite
   infestations in urban trees. The likelihood of infestation was rated
   independently by a computer program and an experienced listener that
   distinguished insect sounds from background noises. Because soil is a
   good insulator, termite sounds could be detected easily underneath
   infested trees, despite the presence of high urban background noise.
   Termite sounds could be detected also in trunks, but background noise
   often made it difficult to identify termite signals unambiguously. High
   likelihoods of termite infestation were predicted at four live oak
   (Quercus virginiana Mill, Fagacae), two loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.,
   Pinacae), and two baldeypress (Taxodium distichum Rich. Pinacae) trees
   that wood-baited traps bad identified as infested with Coptotermes
   formosanus Shiraki. Infestations also were predicted at two pine trees
   with confirmed recoveries of Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar). Low
   likelihoods of infestation were predicted in four oak trees where no
   termites were found. Additional tests were conducted in anechoic
   environments to determine the range of acoustic detectability and the
   feasibility of acoustically estimating termite population levels. There
   was a significant regression between the activity rate and the number of
   termites present in a wood trap block, with a minimum detectable number
   of approximate to50 workers per liter of wood. The success of these
   field tests suggests that currently available acoustic systems have
   considerable potential to detect and monitor hidden infestations of
   termites in urban trees and around building perimeters in addition to
   their present uses to detect and monitor termite infestations in
   buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution and movement patterns of several species of stored-product
   pests in a food processing plant were investigated. The objectives of
   this study were to determine the temporal and spatial variation in
   abundance of stored-product pests using pheromone traps; assess the
   effectiveness of trap type, location, and number on monitoring insect
   populations; and to evaluate the nature of pheromone trap capture hot
   spots by measuring patterns of insect movement. We determined that the
   distributions of Trogoderma variabile Ballion, Lasioderma serricorne
   (F.), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and Plodia interpunctella (Hubner)
   within the facility were typically clumped and that foci of high trap
   captures, based on visual observation of contour maps, varied among
   species and over time. Trap type and location influenced the number of T
   variabile captured: traps on the floor and along walls captured more
   individuals than hanging traps and traps next to support pillars. T
   variabile was the predominant insect pest at this facility and from
   mark-recapture studies, we found that individual beetles moved across
   multiple floors in the facility and from 7 to 216 in though the

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted in 1997-1999 in Washington Co., NC, to
   examine how cotton, Gossypium hirsutum, is affected by thrips species
   composition and abundance, environmental factors, and insecticide
   applications. Populations of adult and juvenile thrips were monitored in
   seedling cotton treated with insecticide applications of either
   imidacloprid as a seed treatment, acephate as a foliar spray, or
   aldicarb applied in-furrow. The number of plants per 3.05 row-m,
   location of the first fruiting branch, number of open bolls per 1.52
   row-m, yields, accumulated degree-d 60's (DD60's), and accumulated
   rainfall were recorded each year the studies were conducted. Aldicarb
   and acephate provided better thrips control than did imidacloprid in all
   3 yrs. Thrips species ratios differed among years. In 1997, the aldicarb
   treatment resulted in a better ``earliness profile{''} (lower fruit set
   and more early opening bolls) than either acephate or imidacloprid,
   while in 1998 and 1999 there were few differences in these plant
   parameters. In 1997, all insecticide treatments resulted in
   statistically higher yields compared with the untreated check.
   Accumulated DD60's were consistently higher in 1998 and 1999 than in
   1997 after the first thrips sampling date. Cumulative rainfall appeared

Abstract = {{Under international treaty, the United States and Russia are disposing
   of their aging stockpile of chemical weapons. Incineration and chemical
   neutralization are options for sites in the United States, although
   Russia prefers the latter. The storage and disposal of bulk and chemical
   agents and weapons involve unique hazards of handling extremely toxic
   materials. There are three major areas of concern the storage stockpile,
   the disposal area, and the discovery and destruction of found material
   not considered part of the stockpile. Methods have been developed to
   detect the presence of chemical agents in the air, and these are used to
   help assure worker protection and the safety of the local population.
   Exposure limits for all chemical agents are low, sometimes nanograms per
   cubic meter for worker control limits and picograms per cubic meter for
   general population limits. There are three types of monitoring used in
   the USA: alarm, confirmation, and historical. Alarm monitors are
   required to give relatively immediate real-time responses to agent
   leaks. They are simple to operate and rugged, and provide an alarm in
   near real-time (generally a few minutes). Alarm monitors for the
   demilitarization program are based on sorbent pre-concentration followed
   by thermal desorption and simple gas chromatography. Alarms may need to
   be confirmed by another method, such as sample tubes collocated with the
   alarm monitor and analyzed in a laboratory by more sophisticated
   chromatography. Sample tubes are also used for historical perimeter
   monitoring, with sample periods typically of 12 h. The most common
   detector is the flame photometric detector, in sulfur or phosphorous
   mode, although others, such as mass-selective detectors, also have been
   used. All agents have specific problems with collection, chromatography
   and detection. Monitoring is not made easier by interferences from
   pesticide spraying, busy roadways or military ring ranges. Exposure
   limits drive the requirements for analytical sensitivity. Lowering
   limits adds additional difficulties to the monitoring efforts. The
   various monitoring methods and the role they play in ensuring worker and
   general population safety are discussed.}},

   children in all the regions monitored. In the adult population small
   differences were found between some regions but these differences were
   not dependent on industrial pollution. The values of toxicologically

Abstract = {{Cyanobacteria blooms are common in the Baltic Sea and are considered to
   be a poor food source and sometimes toxic to zooplankton. Most
   experiments demonstrating harmful effects have been short-term
   incubations with monocultures or simple mixtures of food. In this study,
   a mesocosm approach was used to examine zooplankton responses over
   generation timescales. A toxic strain of the cyanobacterium Nodularia
   spumigena was added to bag enclosures of ambient water. The initial
   mesozooplankton concentration was either reduced by prescreening the
   water or enriched with locally caught zooplankton. Experiments ran for
   15 days, long enough to monitor reproductive success and development of
   the next mesozooplankton generations. There was no major harmful effect
   on the zooplankton assemblage, even though the concentration of the
   toxin nodularin was in the upper range of field observations. The
   copepod Eurytemora affinis, rotifers Synchaeta spp. and the cladoceran
   Bosmina longispina maritima were able to develop and reproduce
   successfully in the presence of N. spumigena. The only species showing
   impaired recruitment was the copepod Acartia bifilosa. The general lack
   of population level effects from N. spumigena in this study can be
   reconciled with previous observations of adverse effects. Cyanobacteria
   alone may be poor food and toxic to zooplankton, but in the mesocosms a
   rich assemblage of microbiota developed, similar to that associated with
   blooms in the field. We suggest that, in the context of otherwise
   food-depleted summer situations in the open Baltic Sea, zooplankton can
   derive benefit from cyanobacteria bloom assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Both the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis and its close relative
   Caligus elongatus are ectoparasitic on Salmonidae in salt water in the
   northern hemisphere. In this study we monitored population dynamics of
   these parasites on anadromous brown trout, i.e. sea trout, on the
   Norwegian Skagerrak coast in the winters of 1998-1999 and 1999-2000. The
   low salinity was expected to reduce sea lice populations as lice do not
   tolerate sojourns of more than a few weeks, at most, in freshwater.
   Results confirmed the presence of both parasite species on estuarine sea
   trout in winter, and showed that the lice populations go through a
   bottleneck in this period. Prevalences of infection of both parasite
   species were very different in the two sampling periods, but fell below
   10\% in March in both winters. Median infection intensity was 1-2
   fish(-1). Salinity was statistically related to the presence of C.
   elongatus both winters, and to L. salmonis in 1999-2000. Temperature
   appeared to be less important for the abundance of lice.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the effectiveness of broadcasting recordings of

   bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) populations within an 8,000-ha wetland
   complex in western New York, USA, during 2000. Call-response trials on
   15 radiomarked males increased least bittern calling (25.4\% of trials)
   compared to passive listening (9.5\%; P= 0.010), and response to
   broadcasts was higher near nest initiation (46.9\% of trials) versus
   incubation (11. 1 \%) and hatching (11. 1 \%; P < 0.005). Call-response
   surveys are all effective monitoring tool for least bitterns, but
   surveys should be conducted when most birds are initiating nests.
   Response rates also can be used to estimate true abundance of male least
   bitterns in a marsh.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the impact of habitat fragmentation, roads, and other
   anthropogenic influences on cougars (Puma concolor) requires
   quantitative assessment of habitat selection at multiple scales. We
   calculated annual and multiyear home ranges using a fixed-kernel (FK)
   estimator of home range for 13 adult female and 2 adult male radiotagged
   cougars that were monitored October 1986 through December 1992 in the
   Santa Ana Mountain Range of southern California, USA. Using
   compositional analysis, we assessed diurnal use of vegetation types and
   areas near roads at 2 orders of selection (second- and third-order;
   Johnson 1980). Mean annual and multiyear 85\% FK home ranges for males
   were larger than those reported by previous studies in California. Mean
   wet-season 85\% FK home ranges were significantly larger than those of
   the dry season. At both scales of selection and across seasons, cougars
   preferred riparian habitats and avoided human-dominated habitats.
   Grasslands were the most avoided natural vegetation type at both scales
   of selection. Although cougar home ranges tended to be located away from
   high- and low-speed 2-lane paved roads (second-order avoidance), cougars
   did not avoid roads within their home range, especially when roads were
   in preferred riparian areas. Protection of habitat mosaics that include
   unroaded riparian areas is critical to the conservation of this cougar
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Many analytical techniques have been developed to estimate wildlife
   abundance from harvest data. The Sex-Age-Kill model of population
   reconstruction has a long history of rise to monitor white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) numbers. The model is readily interpretable
   using data commonly collected by wildlife agencies. These features make
   implementation straightforward and abundance estimates understandable.
   However, the nonlinear nature of the estimation scheme complicates the
   variance structure of the model and how individual input parameters
   influence the precision of abundance estimates. We present generic
   variance expressions for adult male, adult female, juvenile, and total
   population abundance derived for the Sex-Age-Kill model. Using these
   variance expressions, we illustrate how the precision of the input
   parameters influences the overall precision of abundance estimates. To
   obtain the ``rough management{''} benchmark (Robson and Regier 1964) for
   the precision of the abundance estimates, the individual input
   parameters must be estimated with coefficients of variation (CVs) <0.15.
   An intermediate level of precision for ``accurate management{''} would
   require CVs < 0.08; to achieve a high level of precision for ``careful
   research{''} would constrain all input parameter CVs < 0.03. These
   results suggest that very precise field data are required for reliable
   population estimates. We also develop a cost function that identifies
   how hinds should be spent to improve model estimates most economically.
   We suggest that researchers examine other heuristic Population
   assessment techniques to develop rigorous methods for survey design and
   data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The movements of four Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta
   caretta; three females, one male) were tracked via satellite telemetry
   for between 108 and 457 days. Total length of the routes traveled by the
   turtles varied between 2554 and 7098 km, and the average travel rate was
   1.2 km h(-1). Long-distance movement between the western and eastern
   Mediterranean basins followed a seasonal pattern and seemed to be
   triggered by temperature and food availability. In the autumn/winter
   months turtles moved from west to east in search of warmer waters, and
   returned to the western basin in spring, where food resources are
   generally more plentiful. Three (two females, one male) of the four
   turtles migrated eastward through the Straits of Messina, which is
   characterized by high fishing pressure and intense boat traffic.
   Information about turtle migration patterns and routes will serve to
   plan effective conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Sea otter (Enhydra lutris ) populations experienced widespread reduction
   and extirpation due to the fur trade of the 18th and 19th centuries. We
   examined genetic variation within four microsatellite markers and the
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) d-loop in one prefur trade population and
   compared it to five modern populations to determine potential losses in
   genetic variation. While mtDNA sequence variability was low within both
   modern and extinct populations, analysis of microsatellite allelic data
   revealed that the prefur trade population had significantly more
   variation than all the extant sea otter populations. Reduced genetic
   variation may lead to inbreeding depression and we believe sea otter
   populations should be closely monitored for potential associated
   negative effects.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 1990s the Sardinian warbler began nesting in Cyprus, and
   now has two breeding populations, in the west and north of the island.
   Observations of the western population show that its range is still
   expanding and that the endemic Cyprus warbler has declined in the areas
   colonized by the Sardinian warbler. However, the Cyprus warbler is still
   present in most of these areas, and hence, although the Cyprus warbler
   is a species of European Conservation Concern, the current situation
   requires further study rather than alarm. The Sardinian warbler is the
   more numerous species at lower altitudes, whilst the Cyprus warbler is
   more common at higher altitudes, especially above 500 m. Within their
   areas of overlap, both Cyprus and Sardinian warbler populations occur
   throughout almost all habitats; natural, semi-natural and
   agro-ecosystems. We recommend that monitoring should continue, with more
   detailed ecological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus is a threatened cliff-nesting
   raptor mainly distributed in the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.
   The European population has declined and the species is considered
   Vulnerable in Spain. Before effective conservation programmes can be
   proposed the causes of this decline need to be considered. In a
   monitoring programme of the population of Bonelli's eagle in Murcia
   carried out since 1983 we observed a marked decline, followed by a
   period of stability that began in 1990. Using demographic data
   (territorial bird survival, non-territorial bird survival, and
   fecundity) for 1990-1998 we applied a territorial occupancy model to
   evaluate management alternatives for the species. The model, which
   assumes demographic stability, estimates an equilibrium proportion of
   habitat occupancy as a function of life history parameters, dispersal
   behaviour and habitat suitability. In spite of some limitations the
   model identified the most important conservation measures required for
   an increase in the proportion of territories occupied: the improvement
   of the survival of both territorial and non-territorial birds, and an
   increase in the proportion of suitable habitat.}},

Abstract = {{During a 6-year study, effects of two contrasting regimes of pesticide
   use on pitfall and suction catches of Collembola were monitored in an
   arable field under a rotation of grass and winter wheat. Current farm
   practice (CFP) represented conventional fungicide and herbicide use plus
   applications of organophosphorus (OP) insecticides, whereas reduced
   input approach (RIA) utilised minimum inputs of fungicides and
   herbicides and excluded any use of insecticides. Compared with RIA, the
   CFP regime caused a substantial decline in the abundance and diversity
   of Collembola in the field, including the local disappearance of one
   species, without recovery during the study. At the field edge, which was
   protected during OP applications by a 6-m unsprayed buffer zone, effects
   of the CFP regime were less severe, and were not persistent in the long
   term. Some Collembola species occurred only in field-edge samples.
   Pitfall and suction sampling yielded remarkably similar patterns of
   catches, indicating that pitfall trapping may be appropriate for
   detecting long-term changes in collembolan abundance caused by intensive
   agricultural management practices. (C) 2002 Society of Chemical

   intraspecific differences in germination capacity were associated with
   differences in the endogenous levels of both gibberellins. The contents

Abstract = {{Owing to the limited knowledge of small mammals of Swaziland, the
   present study conducted a small mammal survey in the Maguga Dam
   inundation and surrounding areas in Swaziland. In addition it assessed
   small mammal diversity, species richness (variety), and abundance ratio
   (evenness) in specific vegetation (or habitat) types. Mean diversity
   values of 0.9 at 66.6\% of transects indicated that pockets of fairly
   pristine habitat still exist. Large differences in mammal composition,
   trap success and diversity were found between habitats. In the most
   disturbed areas, fewer species were found and Mastomys sp. dominated.
   Lack of dominance of Mastomys species, species richness and diversity
   are small mammal community characteristics that indicate ecosystem
   integrity. Thus direct monitoring of small mammals can be a time- and
   cost-efficient method of assessing ecological disturbance. The six
   Grammomys dolichurus specimens found during this study are to date the
   only records of this species in Swaziland.}},

Abstract = {{Accuracy, bias and precision of helicopter-based counts for black
   rhinoceros in Pilanesberg National Park were established using accurate
   population estimates derived from intensive monitoring. Over the 19-year
   period studied there were changes in sampling methods, and techniques
   employed. Accuracy and precision increased similarly as the number of
   observers increased. Total area counts were more accurate than sampled
   counts. The most accurate and precise estimates were produced using
   total area parallel transect counts with three observers. Confidence
   limits using one observer were wide, and widest for sampled counts with
   one observer. Sampled counts were more repeatable than total area block
   counts. Total area counts using blocks produced positively biased
   estimates for two successive years. This was attributed to management
   functions, the counting operation, lack of standardization of methods,
   observer error and environmental factors. The use of multiple teams of
   observers, multiple scribes/navigators, and inexperienced observers over
   the period of a count are not recommended. To achieve repeatable counts
   the technique should be applied in a consistent manner. A logistic
   regression model predicted the proportion of population counted as a
   function of the number of observers and seasonal rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction,(PCR) method
   that can quantify hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in sediment samples
   based on a catabolic gene associated with the first step of anaerobic
   toluene and xylene degradation. The target gene, bssA, codes for the
   alpha-subunit of benzylsuccinate synthase. The primer-probe set for
   real-time PCR was based on consensus regions of bssA from four
   denitrifying bacterial strains; bssA sequences for two of these strains
   were determined during this study. The method proved to be sensitive
   (detection limit ca. 5 gene copies) and had a linear range of >7 orders
   of magnitude. We used the method to investigate how, gasohol releases
   from leaking underground storage tanks could affect indigenous
   toluene-degrading bacteria. Microcosms inoculated with aquifer sediments
   from four different sites were incubated anaerobically with BTEX
   (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) and nitrate in the
   presence and absence of ethanol. Overall, population trends were
   consistent with observed toluene degradation activity: the microcosms
   with the most rapid toluene degradation also had the largest. numbers of
   bssA copies. In the microcosms with the most rapid toluene degradation,
   numbers,of bssA copies increased 100- to 1000-fold over the, first 4
   days of incubation, during which time most of the toluene. had been
   consumed. These results were supported by slot blot analyses with
   unamplified DNA and by cloning and sequencing of putative bssA
   amplicons, which confirmed the real-time PCR method's specificity for
   bssA. Use of a companion real-time PCR method for estimating total
   eubacterial populations (based on 16S rDNA) indicated that, in some
   cases ethanol disproportionately supported the growth of bacteria that
   did not contain bssA. The real-time, PCR method for bssA could be a.
   powerful tool for monitored natural, attenuation of BTEX in
   fuel-contaminated groundwater. To our knowledge, this is the first
   reported molecular method that targets anaerobic, hydrocarbon-degrading
   bacteria based on a catabolic gene.}},

Abstract = {{During 1970s and 1980s,, a large area,of mountains in, the Czech
   Republic was influenced by long-term industrial air pollution. Among the
   most degraded areas were the peaks of the Moravskoslezske Beskydy Mts,
   where vast clearings resulted from emissions and subsequent forest
   destruction. This study is, aimed at determining the degree of
   deforestation that is necessary to cause changes in structure and
   species diversity of small mammal communities that were observed
   previously. Communities of rodents and insectivores were monitored for a
   minimum of 3 years at two mountain ranges of the Moravskoslezske Beskydy
   Mts (Czech Republic) by standard mouse snap-traps. The localities (Smrk
   and Knchyne) differ by the degree of human disturbance. Clearings on
   Smrk Mt are very large (> 30 ha) with no remaining original forest
   growth as a result of intensive air pollution, unlike the same habitat
   type at Knchync Mt, where the clearings are minor (< 3 ha) and contain
   living solitary trees. Structure and diversity of small mammal
   communities in clearings were compared with those from original forests
   and other mountain habitats. Communities of small mammals at clearings
   in Smrk Mt (with dominating Microtus agrestis) are structurally very
   different from all other habitats, while structure of communities at
   Knchync clearings are very similar to those of original mountain forest
   (Complete linkage clustering based on Renkonen index). The community of
   the original mountain spruce forest at Knchync had the highest species
   diversity (according to Shannon-Weaver, Brillouin, and Simpson indices,
   Shannon evenness, and rarefaction), while species diversity at clearings
   of Smrk was the lowest. Shannon diversity of community-at Knchync
   primeval forest is similar to that of Knchync clearings, while at Smrk
   Mt the forest diversity is higher than that of clearings. The species
   diversity of mountain forest and clearings at Knchync Mt was
   significantly higher than that in the same habitats at Smrk Mt. Our
   results obtained in disturbed habitats at Knchync and Smrk Mts suggest
   that the degree of deforestation may influence the presence and/or the
   degree of community changes. If the forest destruction is relatively
   small (clearings < 3 ha), the structure and diversity of small mammal
   communities do not differ from those of original forest.}},

Abstract = {{This preliminary study proposes small trapping grids as an alternative
   to traditional large grids for the simultaneous monitoring of several
   rodent populations by capture-recapture. Monthly trapping sessions of
   wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (Linnaeus, 1758) and bank vole
   Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780) were carried on over a small
   area (0.015 ha, 21 traps). The coherence of demographic parameter
   estimates on such small grids with those obtained on classical large
   grids was checked by performing two trapping sessions on a larger grid
   (0.9 ha, 110 traps, 10 m mesh) surrounding the small grid. We compared
   the two grid designs on the basis of sex ratio upon first capture, trap
   saturation rate, minimum number alive (MNA), monthly survival, and
   trappability. These demographic parameters proved to be non-biased by
   the trapped area, even though the precision was lower on the small grid.
   Small grids seem therefore to give the same picture of population
   dynamics as classical large grids except for parameters sensitive to an
   edge effect (eg density). By decreasing significantly the trapping
   effort, small grids will be of particular interest whenever the
   simultaneous operation of several trapping grids is needed (eg to
   compare different environmental conditions).}},

Abstract = {{Sampling systems for population studies of subterranean woolly apple
   aphid, Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann) (Homoptera: Aphididae), are not
   available. Therefore, a system for monitoring underground population
   levels of this species was developed. A standard soil sample was taken
   to a depth of 15 cm using an auger with an internal diameter of 5 cm.
   Either a hand or mechanical auger may be used. Distance from the trunks
   of apple trees, and the amount and nature of root material in the
   samples, affected the number of aphids recorded. More aphids were
   recorded in soil samples containing root material, particularly if the
   roots had galls resulting from the feeding of E. lanigerum, than in
   samples in which there were no roots. The number of E. lanigerum in
   samples decreased as the distance from the trunk at which they were
   taken increased. The distance from the trunk at which samples were taken
   was standardized to 30 cm. The system will be suitable for detecting
   changes in subterranean population levels over time and for comparing
   soil treatments for woolly apple aphid control, but not for decision
   making regarding the necessity for control actions.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Brachycaudus schwartzi (Borner) were found on peach and
   nectarine (Prunus persica Siebold \& Zuccarini) trees in Parlier, CA, in
   summer 2000. To determine if this aphid could be a pest of P. persica, a
   nine-variety host range test was conducted using a no-choice arena and
   temperature-dependent development studies of the aphid at 15, 20, 22.5,
   25, 27.5, 30, and 32.5degreesC. Nectarine variety Mayfire (r(m) = 0.286)
   and Queencrest peach (r(m) = 0.283) were found to be the best hosts
   followed by Mayglo nectarine (r(m) = 0.253). Mayfire was, therefore,
   selected as the host plant for the colony and for the temperature
   development studies. Detached shoot terminals of Mayfire were maintained
   on Hoagland's solution and placed in small cages in growth chambers. One
   adult aphid was introduced onto each flush and development of aphid
   offspring was monitored daily. The shortest developmental time from
   first instar to adult aphid was 6.9 d at 25degreesC and the longest was
   19.9 d at 15degreesC. Adult longevity was 38.5 d at 15degreesC and the
   highest offspring per female was 46.4 nymphs per female at 20degreesC.
   The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) rose sharply from 15degreesC
   (0.109 nymphs/male/d) to a maximum at 25degreesC (r(m) = 0.286), and
   then fell sharply at 27.5degreesC with high mortality at 30degreesC and
   above. The lower threshold for development was 10.04degreesC. Overall,
   the data indicate that B. schwartzi does better at cooler temperatures
   and that early season peach or nectarine varieties may be susceptible to
   damage by this aphid.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of an intensive sampling programme on an inshore population
   of Notothenia coriiceps was studied at Potter Cove, South Shetland
   Islands, by comparing catch data taken in successive summers of 1992/93
   to 1994/95 at one specific zone (site 1) with those taken in the 1994/95
   summer at two close but not previously sampled zones (sites 2 and 3).
   The fish were caught with trammel nets under similar. sampling
   conditions (depth, net measurements, bottom type). In site 1, a decline
   in length (TL) of the fish was observed throughout the whole period. The
   fish from sites 2 (mean = 32.4 cm) and 3 (mean = 31.8 cm) exhibited no
   significant differences in mean length. They were larger (P = 0.07) than
   those from site I caught in the summers of 1994/95 (mean = 28.8 cm) and
   1993/94 (mean = 30.2 cm), but were similar in size to those sampled in
   the summer of 1992/93 (mean = 31.7 cm), just when the sampling programme
   started in site 1. Although alternative hypotheses to explain the
   results are discussed (e.g. random error, strong recruitment), it is
   suggested that the size variations of the fish sampled at site 1 are due
   to intensive sampling effort carried out throughout this study at that
   specific zone in Potter Cove.}},

Abstract = {{The authors have reviewed studies of human health effects that resulted
   from exposure to methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from the Union
   Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984. The studies were conducted
   during both the early and late recovery periods. Major organs exposed
   were the eyes, respiratory tract, and skin. Although mortality was
   initially high, it declined over time, but remained elevated among the
   most severely exposed population. Studies conducted during the early
   recovery period focused primarily on ocular and respiratory systems.
   Major findings included acute irritant effects on the eyes and
   respiratory tract. In follow-up studies, investigators observed
   persistent irritant effects, including ocular lesions and respiratory
   impairment. Studies conducted during the late recovery period focused on
   various systemic health endpoints. Significant neurological,
   reproductive, neurobehavioral, and psychological effects were also
   observed. Early and late recovery period studies suffered from several
   clinical and epidemiological limitations, including study design, bias,
   and exposure classification. The authors herein recommend long-term
   monitoring of the affected community and use of appropriate methods of
   investigation that include well-designed cohort studies, case-control
   studies for rare conditions, characterization of personal exposure, and
   accident analysis to determine the possible components of the gas cloud.}},

Abstract = {{During a monitoring study from 1984-87, a population of 70-95 breeding
   pairs of the Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa and their offspring were
   observed. Clutch size, fraction hatched, fledging probability, first
   year survival and the yearly resight probability for birds returning to
   the study area were estimated. Nest success ranged from 41.4\% to
   74.6\%. The survival of chicks to fledging was significantly lower in
   cold and wet springs (20.8\%) than in springs with average rainfall and
   temperatures (44.4\%). We estimated productivity at 0.58 -1.18 fledged
   chicks per pair. In the course of the study the net productivity
   decreased. For all godwits marked as chicks, males were resighted more
   frequently than females and at a higher average maximum age. Annual
   adult survival was 81.4\%, with no significant survival difference
   between the sexes. A population model shows that the studied population
   is not in balance and incurs a yearly net loss.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies of long-term air pollution effects have been
   hampered by difficulties in characterizing the spatial variation in air
   pollution. We conducted a study to assess the risk of long-term exposure
   to traffic-related air pollution for the development of inhalant allergy
   and asthma in children in Stockholm county, Munich and the Netherlands.
   Exposure to traffic-related air pollution was assessed through a 1-year
   monitoring program and regression modeling using exposure indicators.
   This paper documents the performance of the exposure monitoring strategy
   and the spatial variation of ambient particle concentrations.
   We measured the ambient concentration of PM2.5 and the reflectance of
   PM2.5 filters ('soot') at 40-42 sites representative of different
   exposure conditions of the three study populations. Each site was
   measured during four 14-day average sampling periods spread over one
   year (spring 1999 to summer 2000). In each study area, a continuous
   measurement site was operated to remove potential bias due to temporal
   variation.
   The selected approach was an efficient method to characterize spatial
   differences in annual average concentration between a large number of
   sites in each study area. Adjustment with data from the continuous
   measurement site improved the precision of the calculated annual
   averages, especially for PM2.5. Annual average PM2.5 concentrations
   ranged from 11 to 20 mug/m(3) in Munich, from 8 to 16 mug/m(3) in
   Stockholm and from 14 to 26 mug/m(3) in the Netherlands. Larger spatial
   contrasts were found for the absorption coefficient of PM2.5. PM2.5
   concentrations were on average 17-18\% higher at traffic sites than at
   urban background sites, but PM2.5 absorption coefficients at traffic
   sites were between 31\% and 55\% increased above background. This
   suggests that spatial variation of traffic-related air pollution may be
   underestimated if PM2.5 only is measured. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Although orang-utans live solitary lives most of the time, they have a
   complex social structure and are characterized by extreme sexual
   dimorphism. However, whereas some adult male orang-utans develop full
   secondary sexual characteristics, such as cheek flanges, others may stay
   in an ``arrested{''} unflanged condition for up to 20 years after
   reaching sexual maturity. The result is a marked bimaturism among adult
   males. Flanged males allow females to overlap with their home range and
   often tolerate the presence of unflanged males. However, wherever
   possible flanged males actively prevent unflanged males from copulating
   with females. Two competing hypotheses, previously untested, have been
   advanced to explain male reproductive behavior and bimaturism in
   orang-utans: (1) the ``range-guardian{''} hypothesis, which asserts that
   the flanged males are postreproductive and defend a range in which they
   tolerate sexually active, unflanged male relatives; and (2) the ``female
   choice{''} hypothesis, which asserts that flanged males tolerate
   unflanged males in their range because they rely on female preference to
   favor flanged males. We investigated these hypotheses and a third
   hypothesis that the two male morphs represent co-existing alternative
   male reproductive strategies ({''}sitting, calling, and waiting{''} for
   flanged males versus ``going, searching, and finding{''} for unflanged
   males). Fecal samples were collected from a well-studied population in
   Indonesia, and eight human microsatellites were analyzed for 30
   individuals that have been behaviorally monitored for up to 27 years. By
   carrying out paternity analysis on 11 offspring born over 15 years, we
   found that unflanged males fathered about half (6) of the offspring.
   Relatedness between successful unflanged males and resident dominant
   males was significantly lower than 0.5, and for some unflanged/flanged
   male pairs, relatedness values were negative, indicating that unflanged
   males are not offspring of the flanged males.}},

Abstract = {{Listed as `vulnerable' by the International Union for the Conservation
   of Nature, the molossid bat Otomops martiensseni occurs widely in Africa
   and, according to some authorities, in Madagascar. Apart from a few
   known cave roosts, there are few records of O. martiensseni, although
   around Durban, South Africa, the species is common and roosts in
   buildings. Originally described as three species, populations of O.
   martiensseni differ significantly in size (length of forearm) between
   East Africa and Durban or Madagascar, but not between Durban and
   Madagascar. Seventeen buildings used as roosts by O. martiensseni
   averaged 34.5 +/- 15.8 years old. In the Durban area, bats entered
   roosts by landing and crawling. Roost populations ranged from 7 to 29
   individuals, typically consisting of one adult male, several adult
   females and young (bats with unossified epiphyses), suggesting a harem
   social structure. The ratio of adult females to young was virtually 1:1,
   and among young the ratio of males:females averaged 2:1. Radio-tracking
   showed that individuals used several day and night roosts, and foraged
   widely in a landscape dominated by sugarcane and urban development. The
   echolocation and many social calls of O. martiensseni are readily
   audible to human observers, allowing a non-contact, low technology
   method for monitoring the local distribution and activity of these bats.
   Although listed as a species of special concern in KwaZulu Natal, there
   these bats appear to be candidates for inclusion on a `blue' list of
   species, ones showing stabilized or increased abundance. We recommend
   that O. martiensseni be recognized as a `flagship' species in the Durban
   area, r epresenting the resilience of nature.}},

Abstract = {{The European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) population at Cies Islands
   (the most important breeding area in its southern limit) increased
   rapidly from 1986 to 1992, and afterwards the population suffered a
   slight decline. This study analyzed population data obtained from
   ringing recoveries and reproductive monitoring between 1993 and 1997.
   The reproductive success was highly variable and associated with adverse
   weather events. Adult survival rate was very low compared with other
   colonies, probably due to high accidental capture in gill-nets. In
   recent years, the fishing effort with gill-nets increased in the Study
   area. Sensitivity analysis of parameters showed that the population is
   more affected by changes in adult survival than in reproductive success.
   When dynamic simulations were run with an increase in shag mortality of
   5\% above the present level, population extinction Occurred in all
   simulations. In contrast, when a reduction of mortality of 5\% was
   introduced in the simulations, the population increased in all cases.
   The main lines of action to study and protect this population should be:
   (1) ringing schemes to obtain better estimates Of Survival variability;
   (2) studies on the interaction of feeding areas and fishing vessels; (3)
   regulations on gill-netting: and (4) the incorporation of population
   models as an adaptive management tool to synthesize assessment work and
   management scenarios. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Egyptian vulture populations have decreased sharply in the Western
   Palearctic: island populations are almost extinct in the Mediterranean
   and the Macaronesian regions. In the Canary archipelago, the species
   only survives in the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. During
   1998-2001 we examined population parameters and evaluated some potential
   limiting factors for this isolated and sedentary population. The total
   population (breeding and non-breeding birds) was monitored annually. In
   addition, 26 fledglings and 33 immatures (< 6 years old) and adult birds
   were captured for individual marking with plastic rings.
   Twenty-three/twenty-four occupied territories were located in the island
   and the total population estimated at around 130 birds. Breeding success
   was lower than recorded elsewhere in the species' distribution area:
   only 0.43 fledglings/pair/year were produced. Adult (> 6 years old
   birds) and immature annual survival rates were similar, around 90\%.
   Adult Survival was lower than expected as territorial birds seem more
   susceptible to poisoning. Immature survival could be favoured by the
   existence of regular feeding places. Casualties from power lines was the
   main cause of mortality (12 cases during the study period). Blood
   sampling revealed high frequencies of lead poisoning: 13.5 and 2.7\% of
   individuals showed sub-clinical and clinical intoxication levels,
   respectively, probably caused by the ingestion of lead shot. Priority
   conservation measures should be directed to reduce electrocution risks,
   illegal poisoning, arid lead contamination. Population reinforcement
   with birds coining from other populations is not recommended as previous
   information reveals morphological and genetic differentiation of
   Canarian Egyptian vultures compared with continental populations. (C)

Abstract = {{Insertion Of beta-D-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene has been found to
   be useful for detection, quantitation, and monitoring of
   plant-associated fungi in their environment. GUS was extracted from
   tomato roots inoculated with a nonpathogenic strain of Fusarium
   oxysporum, 70T01, that had been genetically modified to express both GUS
   activity and hygromycin B resistance. To facilitate studies of
   fungus-plant interactions using the GUS enzyme, we tested several
   methods for their efficiency of preparation of fungal-encoded GUS from
   infected plant tissues, namely FastPrep homogenization, grinding of
   tissues frozen in liquid nitrogen, and extraction from lyophilized
   material. Of the three procedures, the FastPrep method yielded the
   highest GUS activity per unit of inoculated root and provided twice the
   sensitivity of the other methods. This procedure was also the easiest,
   quickest, and the most reliable. Up to 12 samples could be analyzed in
   less than 2 h, and as little as 50 mg of fresh tissue was sufficient. Of
   the factors examined that could affect extraction efficiency, only the
   length of homogenization and the presence of protein stabilizers
   (sucrose, bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors) in the GUS
   buffer improved enzyme activity in the extracts. The FastPrep method was
   also highly effective in enumerating fungal colony forming unit (CFU)
   populations in the root tissues, provided that the timing and speed of
   homogenization was controlled. Plating of infected root samples
   homogenized using the FastPrep equipment and a mortar and pestle yielded
   about 50 times more CFUs per unit root than the colony counts obtained
   from whole roots, dried and powdered roots, or lyophilized roots.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in home-range size can be related to different factors at
   different spatial scales. This study examined the patterns of home-range
   size and habitat selection of American marten (Martes americana) in
   southeastern Labrador, a region of extensive and pristine forests. Over
   1.5 years, we monitored 28 radio-collared marten and compared the
   availability of habitat types with their use. Marten avoided areas with
   low productivity and low canopy cover (<20\%) but showed no selection
   for tree species composition or cover among more productive forests.
   Mean home ranges for both sexes (males, 45.0 km(2); females, 27.6 km(2))
   were exceptionally large, more than double the largest values previously
   recorded for the species. We analyzed variation in home-range size at
   two scales: within our study population and, using data from the
   literature, among populations across the species range in relation to
   temperature, snow cover, and body size. Within our population,
   home-range area was positively related to the proportion of bog and less
   productive, scrub forests in the home range. Among populations,
   differences in home-range size were not significantly related to any of
   the tested factors.}},

Abstract = {{An inventory of marine biotest methods for the evaluation of dredged
   material and sediments was compiled on behalf of the Federal
   Environmental Agency of Germany. Relevant assays were identified from
   the literature and experts from several countries contributed to a
   questionnaire survey on established and developing procedures. The
   biotest methods are applicable to whole sediment, sediment suspension,
   sediment elutriate, porewater and/or sediment extract. The endpoints
   cover acute and long-term toxicity, bioaccumulation, endocrine effects,
   toxic effects on reproduction, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity.
   Comparative analyses and evaluation of the biotest methods were
   conducted with regard to their sensitivity, specificity, applicability
   (regional specificity, availability and suitability of the test
   organisms), variability (physicochemical factors, natural factors and
   factors related to sampling and testing), cost-effectiveness, aspects of
   animal ethics, standardization (guidelines, intercalibration) and
   application for monitoring purposes in the areas of the OSPAR and
   Helsinki Conventions. The available information was integrated to rate
   the validity of the methods, their relevance for assessing impacts on
   ecosystems and the suitability of the methods for the evaluation of
   marine sediments and dredged material.
   Based on the rating of the individual bioassays, a tiered testing is
   suggested in a hierarchical approach representing a variety in taxa,
   biological processes and exposure routes, thereby covering the cellular,
   species, population and community level with a wide discriminatory and
   sensitivity range. The toxicological significance and complexity
   increases with the tiers: (1) screening and detection of impacts, (2)
   characterization of toxic effects, (3) verification of in situ
   alterations. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Although stunting is a common phenomenon in fish populations, the
   consequences of stunted body size on the reproductive ecology of
   individuals has received little attention. The present study compares
   the reproductive ecology of bluegill in established stunted and
   non-stunted populations. Three ponds (two non-stunted and one stunted)
   were monitored for spawning activity throughout the summer. Parental
   male bluegill from both non-stunted populations were older, larger, and
   had greater mating success (number of eggs or fry within nests) than
   parental males in the stunted population. Stunted bluegill also
   experienced a shortened reproductive season owing to the delay in onset
   of spawning. The present study demonstrates that individual size and
   population size structure can have a marked influence on the
   reproductive ecology of bluegill.}},

Abstract = {{In order to unravel the physiological, endocrine, and behavioral
   differences between gregarious and solitarious forms of the desert
   locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk.) (Orthoptera, Acrididae), a
   constant supply of rather large numbers of solitary individuals has to
   be guaranteed. This represents a bottleneck, mainly because of the
   intensity of the labor involved and limited laboratory accommodation.
   The method we describe here substantially reduces the space and manpower
   needed. The survival rate we obtained in the solitarised population was
   relatively high, reaching about 55\%. The optimal rearing temperature
   proved to be 32-36degreesC. Cabbage leaves and oat flakes sufficed for
   feeding all year round. Special racks have been designed that enable
   high density stacking and easy handling. The solitarisation process was
   monitored over ten consecutive generations. Changes in morphometrics,
   eye stripes, color, and behavior were recorded, of which only
   morphometrics, temperature related development, and mortality are
   discussed. A shift towards the solitarious phase was recorded, with
   clear differences between gregarious, 1st generation and 7th to 10th
   generation solitarious locusts.}},

Abstract = {{Specimens of the limpet Patella aspera were collected from a clean,
   coastal marine site and a contaminated estuary on the south coast of
   Portugal. The shells were analysed individually for their minor (Mg, Sr)
   and trace element (Fe, Mn, Zn) content. Mean concentrations of these
   elements in the shell of P. aspera were 4651, 1318, 35.8, 29.9 and 5.5
   mug g(-1), respectively. The elemental concentrations exhibited both a
   marked intra- and inter-population variability. Despite the variability
   within individual populations, significant differences in the trace
   element composition were apparent between the shells taken from the two
   sites. Small shells ( < 2 g) provided the best resolution between sites
   for both manganese and iron. Differences in zinc were best resolved for
   larger shells. The shell of P aspera has an extraordinarily high
   magnesium concentration, which is insensitive to gross salinity
   differences, and a trace metal assemblage that can be interpreted in
   terms of environmental exposure. On these grounds, it is recommended
   that the shell of P aspera is a tissue for potential use in
   environmental trace metal monitoring. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We need to critically assess the present quality of the marine
   ecosystem, especially the connection between ecosystem change and
   threats to human health. In this article we review the current state of
   indicators to link changes in marine organisms with eventual effects to
   human health, identify research opportunities in the use of indicators
   of ocean and human health, and discuss how to establish collaborations
   between national and international governmental and private sector
   groups. We present a synthesis of the present state of understanding of
   the connection between ocean health and human health, a discussion of
   areas where resources are required, and a discussion of critical
   research needs and a template for future work in this field. To
   understand fully the interactions between ocean health and human health,
   programs should be organized around a ``models-based{''} approach
   focusing on critical themes and attributes of marine environmental and
   public health risks. Given the extent and complex nature of ocean and
   human health issues, a program networking across geographic and
   disciplinary boundaries is essential. The overall goal of this approach
   would be the early detection of potential marine-based contaminants, the
   protection of marine ecosystems, the prevention of associated human
   illness, and by implication, the development of products to enhance
   human well-being. The tight connection between research and monitoring
   is essential to develop such an indicator-based effort.}},

Abstract = {{Injury to rotated corn by Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte
   (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) has become a common occurrence across
   east-central Illinois and north-west Indiana. We report results of a
   three-year survey (1999-2001) of soybean fields for D. v. virgifera in
   the lower peninsula of Michigan. We monitored D. v. virgifera with
   unbaited Pherocon AM yellow sticky traps. Only 3 out of 131 fields were
   above the action threshold of more than 3 beetles/trap/day that
   indicates injury to rotated corn may occur. In general the greatest
   number of beetles were collected in southwest Michigan, near the border
   with Illinois and Indiana. However, a single field in central Michigan
   (Clinton County) had populations above the action threshold. To confirm
   that D. v. virgifera oviposition occurred in these soybean fields, we
   monitored adult emergence when these fields were planted to corn the
   following year. As a comparison, we also monitored emergence in adjacent
   continuous cornfields. The highest number of D. v. virgifera collected
   occurred in southwest Michigan (Berrien County) where nearly twice as
   many D. v. virgifera emerged from rotated than continuous cornfields
   during 2002. In central Michigan we observed the opposite relationship,
   more beetles emerged from continuous than rotated cornfields. We suggest
   that large numbers of beetles collected in soybean fields of Clinton
   County most likely emigrated from silage corn that had been harvested
   and were not a rotation-resistant population. The pattern of adult D. v.
   virgifera emergence within rotated cornfields in central Michigan may
   represent the innate capacity of this species to use soybeans as an
   oviposition site rather than evidence of rotation-resistant beetles.}},

Abstract = {{The EMF Exposure Guidelines Science Workshop was held to evaluate the
   information base for guidelines for electric and magnetic field
   exposures at extremely low frequencies, to identify research needs, and
   to discuss how best to apply scientific knowledge in developing exposure
   recommendations. Although the existing guideline values are based on
   electrostimulation of nerve and muscle tissues, guidelines must also
   consider controversial studies of potential health effects from chronic
   exposures at environmental levels that are far too weak to cause
   electrostimulation. The size of the safety factor applied in specifying
   exposure limits reflects a variety of factors that introduce
   uncertainties. These include confidence in existing dose-effect
   relationships, population diversity, the reliability and precision of
   techniques to control over-exposure, and completeness of the information
   base, particularly regarding long-term effects. Specific research
   questions that can change the level of uncertainty meaningfully were
   identified in these areas: biophysical mechanisms of electrostimulation;
   the range of thresholds throughout exposed populations; cancer causation
   in children and adults, including a possible role for contact currents;
   cognitive, behavioral, and physiological effects on the central nervous
   system; improved dosimetry; and better understanding of electromagnetic
   interference with implanted biomedical devices such as pacemakers,
   defibrillators, and physiological monitors. This report introduces ten
   papers from the workshop that address these and related topics in
   detail.}},

Abstract = {{A fish protection system has been installed in a power canal at a
   hydroelectric facility on the Exploits River, Grand Falls-Windsor,
   Newfoundland, Canada. The river has an anadromous Atlantic salmon (
   Salmo salar) population in the order of 30 000 returning adults. A
   louver and bypass were installed to protect downstream migrating smolt
   and kelt from entering the penstocks and turbines in the power canal at
   the generating facility. The efficiency and effectiveness of this
   protection system has been evaluated since 1997 through a combination of
   conventional telemetry, use of a digital spectrum processing (DSP)
   telemetry system with multiple antennae array, floy tagging, and
   velocity profiling along the louver array and throughout the canal.
   Initialmonitoring in 1997 using conventional telemetry indicated low
   fish guidance efficiencies (FGEs) in the area of 25\% for smolt. In
   1998, a DSP telemetry system was installed along the louver array to
   attempt to identify problem areas where fish were passing through or
   under the louver. This work also recorded low smolt FGEs in 1998
   (24.3\%). However, the DSP system did identify sites along the louver
   array where fish were being lost, and hydraulic measurements suggested
   fish loss was related to hydraulic turbulence and irregularities in the
   guidance velocities. In 1999, a scale model of the power canal and
   bypass system was constructed at the University of Waterloo Engineering
   Department's Hydraulic Laboratory and a number of structural and
   operational changes to the system were evaluated. Based on the results
   of laboratory hydraulic modeling and DSP telemetry, a number of changes
   were made to the louver and bypass, prior to operation in 1999 and 2000.
   Monitoring of smolt out migration in 1999 and 2000 indicated a
   substantial improvement in smolt FGEs to 54.0 and 65.3\%, respectively,
   and the DSP system identified areas where further improvements could be
   made. This paper demonstrates the utility of a sophisticated telemetry
   system in the evaluation of fish protection systems and how the
   technology can be applied towards the optimization of the effectiveness
   of fish by-passes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new acoustic telemetry system based on the
   principles of code division multiple access (CDMA) whereby signal coding
   enables the simultaneous sub-meter monitoring of potentially hundreds of
   animals at high sampling rate (e.g. 5 s) and on a single frequency
   channel. The technology permits reliable operation under a variety of
   conditions including high ambient noise, multipath and in the presence
   of multiple tagged animals. The concepts of dilution of precision (DOP)
   and reliability index (RI) as performance measures of CDMA position
   solutions are introduced. DOP and RI are used in the design phase of a
   study to develop hydrophone array geometries that maximize position
   solution precision and minimize the occurrence of system-induced data
   outliers. Computed position solutions qualified by DOP and RI assist in
   data interpretation and provide an objective means of separating system
   induced outliers from animal behavior. To assess the suitability of CDMA
   telemetry for monitoring tagged animals under shallow water conditions,
   experiments were conducted to track the movement of blue crab
   (Callinectes sapidus) in a salt marsh pond. During the study, data from
   32-tagged animals was collected by a CDMA telemetry system and used to
   provide preliminary information on individual animal movement.
   Performance results obtained from the study indicate that the precision
   of position solutions consistently achieved sub-meter levels under
   shallow water conditions (depth < 0.5 m). Accumulated detection
   statistics indicate that the nominal probability of detection exceeded
   80\% at individual hydrophone channels. The ability to simultaneously
   monitor the tagged population of 32 animals at a sampling rate of 5 s
   was verified.}},

Year = {{2002}},

Abstract = {{1. Each day small birds must build up sufficient energy reserves,
   largely fat deposits, for the following night and for the periods when
   foraging is not possible. The earlier the birds acquire the reserves and
   the more they carry them, the higher is the insurance value of the
   reserves. Still, small birds do not forage at maximal capacity during
   the day and, even at dusk, body reserves are usually below the
   physiological upper limit. A popular explanation for this is that birds'
   fatness levels reflect an optimal compromise between starvation risk and
   risks associated with reserve carrying and acquisition,
   2. Theoretical works suggest that uncertain or variable feeding
   conditions should promote high reserve levels, and that in the daily
   perspective, feeding should peak in the morning hours. In more
   favourable conditions, reserve levels should be smaller and the
   acquisition peak should be delayed towards the end of the day. These
   predictions were tested by experimentally manipulating winter feeding
   conditions and monitoring subsequent daily body mass increase in
   northern population of the willow tit Parus montanus (Conrad), a
   small-sized forest passerine.
   3. The birds using feeders appeared heavier than the control birds
   throughout the day. This contradicts the prevailing theory; but is
   understandable since the feeding procedure probably not only affected
   food amount but may also have decreased acquisition costs in terms of
   predation.
   4. Daily mass gain and the gain rates were fairly similar in the
   food-manipulated and the control birds. However, the mass gain schedules
   differed between the treatment groups: the food-supplemented birds
   gained mass at a roughly constant rate while among the control birds the
   gain rate was higher in the morning than in the afternoon. Probably to
   avoid associated costs, birds abandon early build-up of reserves if
   foraging conditions become favourable enough.}},

Abstract = {{The studied coastal area is located along the Atlantic Ocean, between
   the localities of Punta Rasa and Villa Gesell. Twelve monitoring sites
   were established along the shore.
   Two morphologic types of beach profiles were observed. One type located
   northward composed by fine sand, has a linear configuration profile with
   low slopes (0.028) and narrow beach (40-70 m width). The other beach
   type is composed by coarser sand with higher slopes (0.014) and wider
   beaches (40-80 m), usually presenting a stable berm, and one or two
   tidal berms.
   The mean grain size of the beach sediments where the clam Donax
   hanleyanus occurs varies from fine sand (2.10-2.80 phi) for the north
   sector (A) to medium to coarse sand (0.70-1.90 phi) in the south sector
   (B). Donax hanleyanus is found in the lower third of the intertidal zone
   in the transverse profile. A permanent lack of individuals was observed
   in the northern part of sector A due to the fresh water influence of the
   Rio de La Plata estuary. The mean density observed was about 400
   individuals per square meter and the highest densities were recorded for
   Mar del Tuyu with 2250 individuals per square meter.
   The grain size of the sediments analyzed was not correlated with the
   occurrence of Donax hanleyanus, although it was observed that the
   presence of coarser sheets with mean grain size of 0.71 phi and standard
   deviation of 1.07 affect the burrowing capacity of Donax.
   The life span of Donax hanleyanus is greater in the south where they can
   live up to three years. The growth rates are similar for both areas
   although in the south a decrease in the growth rates was observed during
   winter.
   It was observed that the grain size and the morphological changes did
   not condition the presence of Donax but affected the mobility of Donax
   hanleyanus along the transverse beach profile.}},

Title = {{Long- and Short-Term Coastal Erosion in Southern Brazil}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Number = {{36}},
Pages = {{273-282}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{Rio Grande do Sul is the southernmost state in Brazil. Open sandy
   beaches dominate the 630-km long shoreline that is 76\% still
   undeveloped. Less than 5\% of the state's population (totalling 9.7
   million people) live in coastal cities. However, the coastal population
   is growing faster than the state's average since 1990. Although intense
   erosion is widely accepted along the beaches of Conceicao lighthouse and
   Hermenegildo, the extent of erosion along the Rio Grande do Sul
   shoreline is still a controversial issue. Discussions arise from the
   contrasting results presented by studies addressing coastal erosion in
   Rio Grande do Sul. Recent DGPS monitoring indicates that about 80\% of
   the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline is eroding; wave refraction studies
   indicate that it is mainly stable, and long-term coastal evolution
   modelling reveals a predominantly prograding shore for the last 5 ka.
   This work critically evaluates published data on long- and short-term
   causes of coastal erosion in Rio Grande do Sul, hi an attempt to
   highlight the unanswered questions that could minimize the debate. The
   analysis includes sea-level rise, concentration of wave energy due to
   large-scale coastal topography, sand deficit as the long-term causes of
   erosion, storm surges, concentration of wave energy due to small-scale
   submerged features, interference in the longshore sediment transport,
   and human activities as the short-term causes. Discrepancies in
   shoreline change results are a matter of the temporal scale in question
   and what are the causes that play a significant role in it. For coastal
   management purposes short-time events represent a far greater hazard
   than long-term trends. It is therefore reasonable to state that in order
   to support decision-making mechanisms in Rio Grande do Sul a better
   understanding of the relationship of storms, sand budget, and beach
   erosion is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{In Ireland, constructed wetland systems are increasingly being used to
   perform tertiary treatment on municipal waste effluent from small towns
   and villages located in areas whose receiving waters are deemed
   sensitive. The bedrock formation in the west of Ireland is primarily
   karst limestone and where the overburden-soil cover is very shallow,
   such waters are highly sensitive to pollution sources, as little or no
   natural attenuation and/or treatment will occur. Constructed wetland
   technology has been seen to offer a relatively low-cost alternative to
   the more conventional tertiary treatment technologies, particularly when
   dealing with low population numbers in small rural communities. This
   paper examines the waste treatment performance, in terms of nutrient (P
   and N) reduction, of a recently constructed surface-flow wetland system
   at Williamstown, County Galway, Ireland. Performance evaluation is based
   on more than two years of water quality and hydrological monitoring
   data. The N and P mass balances for the wetland indicate that the
   average percentage reduction over the two-year study period is 51\% for
   total N and 13\% for total P. The primary treatment process in the
   wetland system for suspended solids (between 84 and 90\% reduction),
   biological oxygen demand (BOD) (on average, 49\% reduction), N, and P is
   the physical settlement of the particulates. However, the formation of
   algal bloom during the growing season reduces the efficiency of the
   total P removal.}},

Abstract = {{A main goal of the Forest Bird Monitoring Program (FBMP) is to monitor
   temporal trends in forest-dwelling bird abundance in Ontario. The
   program has been running for over a decade. The experience gained from
   this program can provide methodological recommendations to anyone
   planning a similar program to monitor trends in bird populations. Power
   analyses on FBMP data indicated that fur species occurring at 50 sites,
   10 yr of annual sampling at either three or five locations (stations)
   per sampling Site would provide adequate (80\%) power to monitor
   declines in annual counts of 2-3\% (18-26\% decline over 10 yr).
   Obtaining this level of power for species found at fewer than 50 sites
   requires more time, The FBMP method of two visits to each site per year
   seems appropriate. The visits provide different information, but there
   is little indication that one sampling window is superior to the other.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the reproductive biology of a population of Blue-fronted
   Amazons (Amazona aestiva) in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul State,
   Brazil, between 1997 and 1999. Nesting occurred from August to December.
   We monitored 94 nests which were found in trees of different sizes.
   Nesting trees were distributed in all major vegetation associations
   (floodplains, grasslands, scrub savanna, savanna, arboreal savanna,
   riparian forests, and pastures). We found about half of nests (53\%) in
   an open and disturbed area of 34 km(2), yielding a density of 0.5
   nests/km(2), In the remaining 486 km(2) of the study area, we estimated
   a mean density of 0.03 nests/km(2). This could reflect preferences
   towards open and anthropic-influenced habitats or simply visibility
   bias. We found most of the nests in Palmae, Leguminosae, and
   Bignoniaceac, but the proportion of successful nests did not differ
   between tree types. Average clutch size varied little among the three
   ears of study, but nest survival and the proportion of fledglings per
   female were lower in 1998 than in 1997 and 1999. The cause of the lower
   fledging Success in 1998 was not determined, but deforestation, an early
   onset of the rainy season, and higher rates of nest visitation by
   researchers may have been involved.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the correlation between water temperature, colonization

   placentula over two complete annual cycles in two southeastern
   Pennsylvania streams. Previous research in these streams showed that
   differences in diatom community structure between spring and fall were
   not explained by day length, so water temperature was investigated as
   the controlling factor in the density of a single common genus in those
   communities. During the June 1992 to June 1993 period, the diatom
   population was monitored continuously at two-week intervals using 14-day
   colonized glass slides; during 2000-2001, colonization and monitoring
   was over 28-day intervals. Average monthly temperatures and diatom
   densities were analyzed with a Spearman rank-correlation test for each
   stream. There were significant positive correlations between the
   population density of C. placentula and water temperature at all
   population sizes in both streams in both years.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of temperature on population characteristics of Artemia
   sinica Cai from Yanchi Saltlake, Shanxi province, China, were studied in
   the laboratory at a salinity of 60parts per thousand. The developmental
   stages and generation time were dramatically shortened with increasing
   water temperature between 16degreesC and 34degreesC. Hatching and
   survival rates decreased rapidly above 30degreesC. The optimum
   temperature for reproduction and population growth was 26-28degreesC.
   The threshold temperatures for hatching of eggs and development of
   larvae were 9.07degreesC and 11.00degreesC, respectively. The effective
   cumulative temperature for a generation (time x temperature required
   from hatching to death) was 458.4+/-39.6 C degree-days.
   Based on field monitoring, Yanchi Saltlake provides favorable annual
   conditions of 2884.1 C degree-days, which would support an estimated
   6.3+/-0.5 A. sinica generations,per year. The intrinsic and finite rates
   of population increase were both increased with adapted water
   temperature. Extrapolating this data to Yanchi Saltlake, the period from
   the middle of May to September (second to fifth A. sinica generations)
   would be the most productive, with a generation time of < 42 d, a
   population doubling time of < 15 d, a finite rate of increase of > 1.0
   d(-1), and an intrinsic rate of natural increase of > 0.04 d(-1).}},

   speckled padlopers (Homopus signatus signatus) were monitored using
   mark-recapture and thread-trailing methods. Eighty-three tortoises were
   studied between 22 August and 22 September 2000. The maximum number of
   scute rings counted was 14, with females appearing to have longer lives
   than males. Tortoises were encountered on rock slabs, on a rocky hill
   slope, and frequented adjacent, gently sloping fields with many
   flowering plants. The frequent use of shallow concealed crevices as
   hiding places may be, in part, caused by greater availability of such
   refuges. Single specimens were usually found in refugia, but
   occasionally male-female pairs were observed. The shelter types
   identified (rock and spaces under shrubs) were rarely used for more than
   one night. Activity was unimodal. Activity area and daily movements were
   lower in H. s. signatus than in other tortoise species, possibly because
   of their smaller body size, cooler ambient spring temperatures during
   this study, a short measurement period, smaller habitat requirement of
   H. s. signatus, or some combination of the four.}},

Abstract = {{We studied movement patterns, activity, and home range of the eastern
   spiny softshell turtle (Apalone spinifera) in northern Lake Champlain
   (Quebec, Canada; Vermont) from 1996 to 1999. This turtle population is
   at the northern limit of its range and considered threatened. Of the 30
   individuals captured and marked, 15 females and eight males were
   equipped with radio-transmitters and monitored from two weeks to 29
   months. Mean annual home range size for females (32.06 km(2) =, N = 11)
   was significantly larger than for males (2.75 km(2) = N = 4). Home
   ranges generally consisted of a spring-summer concentration area (0.90
   km(2)) and a fall-winter concentration area (1.80 km(2)) plus the area
   traversed between these concentration areas. In general, movements did
   not vary significantly from May to September, but turtles were less
   active after mid-September. Three hibernacula and three nesting sites
   were identified. Seventy five percent of the radio-tracked individuals
   were concentrated in a small area surrounding one hibernaculum from
   September to April. We hypothesize that habitat fragmentation, both
   natural and resulting from human activities, was in part responsible for
   the large home range and long movements observed. Results indicate that,
   to conserve this spiny softshell turtle population, the seasonal
   concentration areas need strict protection, although a lakewide approach
   promoting the preservation of natural habitats is also necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Body size, age, and growth were studied in samples of Nile monitor
   lizards from variably exploited populations. One sample originated from
   the central Niger delta, in Mali, and the other two from Lake Chad.
   Snout-vent length, mean age, and longevity were reduced in the most
   exploited animals. These exhibited a characteristic pattern of somatic
   growth: size increased up to an age of all months and then dropped
   steeply to a negligible level after 54 months. Conversely, in the less
   exploited populations, initial growth was slower but remained at a
   sustained level within the limits of individual longevity. With
   reference to available data on sexual maturation and reproductive output
   in harvested Varanus niloticus, these results suggest that rapid growth
   and early sexual maturity both contribute to a demographic accommodation
   in exploited monitor populations.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted from 1991 through 1997 to evaluate the use
   of pyrethroid and organophosphate (OP) car tags, alternated yearly, for
   the control of a pyrethroid resistant horn fly, Haematobia irritans
   (L.), population in Louisiana. Fly resistance was monitored by weekly
   fly counts, filter paper bioassays and diagnostic polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) assays for the presence of pyrethroid
   resistance-associated mutations in the sodium channel gene coding
   region. Fly control in the first study year was poor, as pyrethroid ear
   tags were effective for only 7 wk. The following year, OP ear tags
   provided 15 wk of fly control. However, in all subsequent years, fly
   control was poor with both types of ear tags. The PCR assays showed that
   there were very few female flies homozygous for the pyrethroid
   susceptible sodium channel allele, never rising above 10\% of the total
   females in the population. A fitness cost appeared to be associated with
   the pyrethroid resistant allele, as the resistant form was selected
   against in the absence of the pyrethroid ear tags. Despite this
   selection in favor of the susceptible allele and the annual alternation
   of pyrethroid and OP ear tags, the percentage of homozygous susceptible
   flies never reached over 19\% of the population, resistant alleles of
   the sodium channel remained at high levels in the population, and horn
   fly control on cattle with either type of tag quickly became minimal.}},

Abstract = {{The greatest constraint to potato production in the United Kingdom (UK)
   is damage by the potato cyst nematodes (PCN) Globodera pallida and G.
   rostochiensis. Management of PCN depends heavily on nematicides, which
   are costly. Of all the inputs in UK agriculture, nematicides offer the
   largest potential cost savings from spatially variable application, and
   these savings would be accompanied by environmental benefits. We mapped
   PCN infestations in potato fields and monitored the changes in
   population density and distribution that occurred when susceptible
   potato crops were grown. The inverse relationship between population
   densitity before planting and multiplication rate of PCN makes it
   difficult to reliable spatial nematicide application procedures.
   especially when the pre-planting population density is just less than
   the detection threshold. Also, the spatial dependence found suggests
   that the coarse sampling grids used commercially are likely to produce
   misleading distribution maps.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored 38 juvenile Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) up to 3 mo
   immediately after their release from a hack box during 1999-2000. The
   restoration site was a cliff near Eagle Point Park in Dubuque, Iowa.
   Falcons were released in a staggered manner from mid-June until late
   July each summer. Older falcons remained at the site longer than at
   previous urban releases and interacted with the younger falcons. The
   four mortalities (11\%) confirmed during the observation periods were
   discovered and reported by citizens near the release site. We used
   radiotelemetry, observations of color-marked birds at the hack site, and
   recovered mortalities to estimate weekly survival rates and dispcrsal
   patterns. We estimated weekly survival rate to be 0.988 (SE = 0.01), and
   our weekly resighting rate was high: 0.885 (SE = 0.03). juveniles were
   observed for an average of 4.3 wk in 1999 (SD = 2.5), but only 3.4 wk in
   2000 (SD = 2.3). Accordingly, weekly fidelity rates were year-specific:
   0.903 (SE = 0.03) in 1999 and 0.795 (SE = 0.05) in 2000. No mortalities
   were attributed to Great-horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) predation, but
   substantial numbers of owls were seen in summer 2000. The presence of
   owls in 2000 may have contributed to the difference in fidelity rates
   and dispersal patterns between years.}},

Abstract = {{The use of breeding dens and the early kitten development was studied in
   a free-ranging population of Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus. Radio-tracking
   of female lynx allowed intensive monitoring of three litters during
   1997, and additional data to be obtained from nine other litters in the
   previous 4 years. Females gave birth a maximum of one litter per year in
   spring; nine of the 10 births were recorded between the last 2 weeks of
   March and the first days of April. Kittens were born semi-altricial and
   reared for nearly 20 days in secluded hollow trunks. Afterwards, they
   were moved between different bushes, which served as auxiliary dens,
   where they began to develop walking and senses. Kittens first consumed
   meat at the age of 4 weeks, although they were not fully weaned until
   they were at least 10 weeks old. At the age of 2 months, kittens began
   to leave the dens, accompanying their mothers on outings. It is
   suggested that the pattern of den use was related to the stage of kitten
   development, to fulfil the kittens' need for both protection and space
   as they grew. Data on kitten denning and development should be accounted
   for in in-situ and ex-situ conservation programmes for this endangered
   felid.}},

Abstract = {{Population subdivision among mouflon sheep Ovis gmelini ewes and ranging
   behaviour of rams were investigated in the Caroux-Espinouse massif
   (southern France). Radio-tracking data from 32 ewes and 41 rams
   monitored in the course of a 10-year study were used to identify female
   units and to document the movement patterns of males during the rutting
   period. Cluster analyses, based on the distance between arithmetic
   centres and on the degree of overlap of locations, were computed. Ewes
   were found to be partitioned in three or four main units to which they
   were faithful. Movement patterns of rams were much more variable: half
   were faithful to a rutting range, overlapping one or more unit(s), and
   the others were not. We suggest that a combination of social and spatial
   attachment could explain this ranging behaviour. Females build up their
   spatial habits following their mothers and, when adults, they occupy the
   area where they have been reared. Their spatial attachment is consistent
   with their social preferences for other females. Males balance between
   antagonistic spatial attachment and social preferences for other males,
   and differ in terms of spatial behaviour. The genetic implications are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Although most snake species are tropical, very little is known about
   their biology. We monitored reproductive histories of individually
   marked natricine colubrid snakes (keelbacks, Tropidonophis mairii) for
   18-months in a tropical Australian floodplain. Our data provide the
   first unambiguous records (for any snake species) of individual females
   in a natural population producing multiple clutches of eggs during a
   single breeding season. The snakes bred throughout drier months of the
   year. The mean size of reproducing females decreased over the season,
   whereas relative clutch mass increased significantly over the same time
   period. Larger females produced eggs that were not only larger, but also
   shorter and wider, than those of smaller females. Despite producing two
   clutches in short succession, female keelbacks grew over the intervening
   period. Thus, they switch from `capital breeding' (building up stores of
   energy during the wet season to use for reproduction in the dry season)
   to `income breeding' (relying on recently ingested energy to support
   both growth and reproduction during the dry season). Two females marked
   at hatching were recaptured as breeding adults < 12 months later,
   confirming that maturation is attained more rapidly in this species than
   in temperate-zone natricines.}},

Abstract = {{Limnological data collected for two years at nine sites in the southern
   end of Cayuga Lake, NY, before the start-up of a cooling water facility
   (summer 2000), are analyzed to identify appropriate measures of trophic
   state and estimate the capability of a monitoring program to identify
   changes associated with the operation of this facility. The
   concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl) is found to be the preferred
   indicator of trophic state. The concentration of total phosphorus and
   clarity are compromised as trophic indicators in this system because of
   the contributions of inanimate particles (tripton) to these measures
   associated with the hydrology and morphometry of the lake and the
   occurrence of the whiting phenomenon. A Before-After-Control-Impact
   design is used to assess the ability of the monitoring program to detect
   potential impacts associated with operation of the cooling water
   facility. Statistical power analyses conducted with the pre-operational
   monitoring data indicate the current bi-weekly sampling program will
   detect a 30\% change in Chi with a probability of 0.7. Attributing
   causation of any future change in Chl coincident with the start-up and
   operation of the cooling water facility is problematic because of
   potential confounding effects associated with variation in phosphorus
   loading from wastewater treatment facilities, natural variation in
   meteorological conditions, and water quality changes associated with
   zebra mussel populations.}},

Abstract = {{Insectivorous bats are integral components of terrestrial ecosystems.
   Despite this, a growing number of factors causing world-wide declines in
   bat populations have been identified. Relatively abundant species are
   important for bat conservation because of their role in ecosystems and
   the research opportunities they offer. In addition, species that have
   been well-studied present unique opportunities to synthesize information
   and highlight important areas of focus for conservation and research.
   This paper focuses on a well-studied abundant bat, Eptesicus fuscus. I
   review the relevant literature on habitat use, diet and roost selection
   by E. fuscus in North America, and highlight important areas of
   conservation and research for this species, including the effects of
   roost disturbance, control of economically important insect pests,
   exposure to pesticides, long-term monitoring of populations, and the
   potential consequences of expanding populations. These issues have broad
   implications for other species and can be used to focus future research
   and conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Within the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
   (DEFRA) is one of several government departments which undertakes
   research in support of its policy aims. For example, DEFRA has
   responsibility for licensing the deposit of materials in the sea in
   order to protect the environment, public health and prevent interference
   with other uses of the sea. This includes assessment of pollutant
   responses in marine organisms. The objectives include assessment of the
   sub-lethal effect that pollutants have at the cellular, organ and
   individual level, for example in normal genetic, behavioural and
   reproductive activity and extrapolation of the potential impact of
   pollutants to populations. This work helps DEFRA to establish whether
   individually or in combination, pollutants have an adverse effect on the
   environment. This paper gives some examples of the research undertaken
   and demonstrates how biological research can provide cost effective
   solutions to analytical problems and an opportunity to predict the way
   in which proposed disposal operations may have an impact on the marine
   environment. The way such research may influence policy is also
   discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Recovery of marine ecosystems from pollution has tended to receive less
   attention than the study of new or continuing impacts, but such studies
   are important in charting recovery from acute incidents and following
   legislation to deal with chronic contamination. Recovery is inevitably a
   long-term process, and where such studies have been made they are often
   too short-lived. Interest quickly wanes following an acute incident and
   governmental bodies rapidly switch to new legislative priorities for
   chronic inputs. We review three case studies: recovery of dogwhelk
   populations after local extinction by tributyl tin leachates from
   antifouling paints; recovery of rocky shore communities from oil spills;
   and recovery of estuarine ecosystems from industrial and urban
   development. We then make some generalisations about recovery processes
   before making a plea for long-term studies of polluted areas. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Coastal ecosystems are subjected to a wide variety of disturbances,
   including those due to xenobiotics of agricultural and industrial
   origin. These pollutants as heavy metals can modify the genetic
   diversity of populations by favouring or counter-selecting certain,
   alleles or genotypes by differential mortality. In the present,study,
   two genetic markers (phosphoglucomutase and glucosephosphate isomerase)
   and a protein marker (metallothionein) were monitored in order to
   determine the impact of heavy metals in different clam populations.
   Analysis of the genetic structure of the clam populations examined
   reveals that those inhabiting environments contaminated by heavy metals
   exhibit a higher allelic diversity and possess alleles at PGM loci that
   could be selected by the presence of heavy metals' The evaluation of
   metallothionein levels using a specific polyclonal antibody developed in
   the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) demonstrated the existence of a
   relationship between metallothionein concentrations and the level of
   metal pollution for clam populations sampled from different sites. An
   inter-specific difference was also detected between Ruditapes decussatus
   and Ruditapes philippinarum living in sympatry at the same site,
   suggesting a differential response of these two species upon exposure to
   an identical heavy metal concentration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{From 1995 to 2000 biological effects were studied in liver of flounder
   (Platichtys flesus L.) from the German Bight. During the study period
   deleterious consequences of acute discharges of DDT and PCBs in early
   spring 1996 and after 1998 due to remobilization of contaminants from
   riverbed deepening of the River Elbe became evident. As core biomarker
   which reflects toxically induced liver pathologies and integrates
   effects of various classes of pollutants we measured the integrity of
   lysosomal membranes in individual flounder liver. During the study
   period, twice statistically significant disturbances of lysosomal
   function was detected in fish from the River Elbe: in summer 1996 and in
   spring 1999. Yet, the detrimental contaminant effects were not only
   restricted to individuals from the Elbe but expanded to those flounder
   inhabiting formerly less polluted reference areas. In contrast to
   flounder of the Elbe, their ability to recover from the lysosomal
   disorders were limited. While in autumn 2000 Elbe individuals showed
   clear signs of recovery, those fish caught in areas more distant to the
   source of toxicant input still maintained significantly decreased
   lysosomal membrane integrity. It can be speculated that fish populations
   which are not continuously exposed to chronic anthropogenic stress may
   have a lower potential or need a longer period to recover from the
   effects of pollution. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Concern over endocrine disrupters in coastal ecosystems has stimulated
   global efforts to understand their potential impacts on fish and
   invertebrate communities. Given that marine crustaceans are sensitive to
   the effects of alkylphenols and other xenobiotics, we are currently
   investigating whether these responses may be caused via an endocrine
   mechanism. Tisbe battagliai (Copepoda: Harpacticoida) is representative
   of an ecologically important group of meiofauna, is sensitive to
   toxicants and is used as an international test species in marine
   eco-toxicology. A 21-day life-cycle test that incorporates assessment of
   survival, development, reproduction and sex ratios, has shown that
   populations of T. battagliai are not significantly affected by
   environmentally relevant levels of steroidal oestrogen agonists, or by
   related synthetic receptor agonists. The absence of in vivo effects due
   to these steroid agonists and antagonists prompted in vitro studies of
   ecdysteroid receptor activity of a range of reference compounds and
   environmental contaminants with an ecdysteroid receptor (EcR/USP)-based
   screening assay derived from the B-II haemocyte line of Drosophila
   melanogaster. The implications for environmental monitoring of endocrine

   displayed alone on territories until the second half of August, when

   undertaken entirely by the female, who was not fed on the nest by the
   male. Chick provisioning was done mainly by the male. Arachnids and
   terrestrial amphipods were the most common prey brought to chicks. The
   fledging period was 12 days. Modal clutch size was three eggs, and
   depredation rates of eggs and chicks were high. After losses,
   replacement clutches were laid on average 19 days later, after a new
   nest was built. A maximum of three clutches per pair was recorded. Of 18
   eggs monitored, 28\% hatched and 17\% fledged, equating to a production
   of one fledgling per pair per year. Ten days after fledging, the entire
   family leaves the territory, males probably returning once young are
   independent. The main threats to the local populations are clearing of
   riparian undergrowth and management practices that impact the predators

Abstract = {{Advances in understanding insecticide resistance in the peach-potato
   aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), at the genotypic, biochemical and
   molecular levels have led to rapid and precise methods for the detection
   of several resistance mechanisms (elevated carboxylesterase, modified
   acetylcholinesterase or MACE, and knockdown resistance or kdr) in
   individual insects, and for monitoring their frequencies over space and
   time. This paper summarises the results of two long-term surveys of
   resistance dynamics in M persicae in England, based on samples collected
   directly from field and glasshouse crops or from four 12.2-m suction
   traps. The study showed marked fluctuations in resistance frequencies
   that probably reflect the counteracting forces of selection imposed by
   insecticides for aphids possessing more copies of esterase resistance
   genes, and selection against these forms when insecticide use is
   relaxed. There is growing evidence that several different resistance
   mechanisms in M persicae have associated fitness costs. In the case of
   esterase and MACE, these costs are apparently strong enough to effect a
   decline in resistance frequency over winter, and a more prolonged
   decline over successive cropping seasons when aphid numbers are

   method was established to determine the baseline sensitivity of key weed

   for post-emergence control of dicotyledonous weeds in cereals. The aim
   of the baseline monitoring project was to understand the natural
   variation in response to florasulam of diverse populations of Papaver
   rhoeas at the time of product launch. The method entailed seed
   collection from representative agricultural areas throughout Europe. The
   seed was subjected to glasshouse tests where dose-response studies were
   conducted and ED80 values generated. This enabled a sensitivity index to
   be calculated for each country, giving an indication of the variation in
   P rhoeas response to florasulam in the populations tested. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This study explores early vegetation development on pumice at Mount St.
   Helens. We monitored species annually in a grid of 200 contiguous
   100-m(2) plots between 1989 and 1999. Of interest were how vegetation
   changed and if it became more homogeneous over time. Species richness
   and cover increased annually. Diversity (H') stabilized by 1996 and
   began to decline as long-lived stress-tolerant species such as Agrostis
   pallens, Carex mertensii and Penstemon cardwellii began to dominate.
   Protected sites had more species and higher cover than did exposed ones.
   Plots next to relict vegetation had more species and cover than did
   distant plots. The vegetation initially was dominated by species with
   good dispersal, but subsequently those with poor dispersal became
   dominant. We compared species expansion patterns to a model based on
   random colonization. The results implied that populations with poor
   dispersal derived from a few colonists that then produced seeds for
   local expansion. Detrended correspondence analysis showed a pronounced
   shift in species composition. This analysis also showed that species
   composition was becoming more homogeneous over time. However,
   significant heterogeneity remained and some plots are diverging from
   others. As yet, this vegetation is not developing towards a regional
   vegetation type. Rather, an unusual community with Agrostis spp., Carex
   spp., Penstemon cardwellii, Lupinus lepidus, Anaphalis margaritacea and
   Salix commutata has developed. The accumulation phase of primary
   succession is nearly complete. The next phase, in which vertical
   structure develops as Salix and conifers mature, has scarcely begun. It
   should be marked by the invasion of forest understory species and loss
   of subalpine meadow species. Assembly rules based on biotic interactions
   may then become evident.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the response of salt marshes to tidal restoration relies on
   comparisons of ecosystem attributes between restored and reference
   marshes. Although this approach provides an objective basis for judging
   project success, inferences can be constrained if the high variability
   of natural marshes masks differences in sampled attributes between
   restored and reference sites. Furthermore, such assessments are usually
   focused on a small number of restoration projects in a local area,
   limiting the ability to address questions regarding the effectiveness of
   restoration within a broad region. We developed a hierarchical approach
   to evaluate the performance of tidal restorations at local and regional
   scales throughout the Gulf of Maine. The cornerstone of the approach is
   a standard protocol for monitoring restored and reference salt marshes
   throughout the region. The monitoring protocol was developed by
   consensus among nearly 50 restoration scientists and practitioners. The
   protocol is based on a suite of core structural measures that can be
   applied to any tidal restoration project. The protocol also includes
   additional functional measures for application to specific projects.
   Consistent use of the standard protocol to monitor local projects will
   enable pooling information for regional assessments. Ultimately, it will
   be possible to establish a range of reference conditions characterizing
   natural tidal wetlands in the region and to compare performance curves
   between populations of restored and reference marshes for assessing
   regional restoration effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The Gauteng Department of Agriculture, Conservation, Environment and
   Land Affairs is often faced with the necessity of priority setting for
   the distribution of limited resources. As conservation action cannot be
   targeted simultaneously to all 32 Red Data plant taxa in the province of
   Gauteng, a hierarchical priority ranking scheme was developed using
   criteria reflecting species distribution, current conservation status
   and factors of threat. The current top five Red Data plant taxa in
   Gauteng are Khadia beswickii, Delosperma macellum, Ceropegia decidua
   subsp. pretoriensis, Delosperma purpureum and Delosperma gautengense.
   The resulting priority list will be used to distribute resources for the
   development of long-term monitoring programmes and extensive ecological
   and population studies for priority taxa. The priority ranking scheme
   forms the basis of a departmental policy to assist with the evaluation
   of development applications and environmental impact assessments
   affecting Red Data plant taxa in Gauteng. The scheme will also be used
   as a factor in setting priority conservation areas for future
   conservation action in the province.}},

Abstract = {{At the University of Texas' Brackenridge Field Laboratory we maintain
   one of two laboratories in the U.S. devoted to research on the basic
   biology of Pseudacteon phorid flies, a diverse genus of fire ant
   parasitoids. Goals include 1) screening various South American species
   of Pseudacteon for their potential to negatively impact the red imported
   fire ant, S. invicta, 2) testing prospect species for their host
   specificity, 3) developing methods for rearing candidate species, and
   successfully introducing them to Texas, and 4) monitoring impact of fire
   ant phorids on local ant community organization.
   Challenges in introducing tropical P. tricuspis to control S. invicta
   populations across central and south Texas include the 1) high rate of
   polygyny in S. invicta populations and 2) harsh, unpredictable climate
   of the region. Nevertheless, field-bred P. tricuspis have been recovered
   in 9 of 15 experimental release sites over periods up to 27 months. In
   South America, we have collaborated with colleagues to study the life
   histories, geography, and seasonal phenologies of little known
   Pseudacteon species such as P. cultellatus. Our laboratory experiments
   have shown that different species of Pseudacteon vary in the extent to
   which they disrupt the foraging activities of fire ants. Laboratory
   experiments revealed the negative impact of P. tricuspis on colony
   protein consumption which ultimately affects colony fitness. Our results
   from various investigations lead to the conclusion that in Texas,
   biological control of fire ants using phorid flies will likely require
   more than a single species of Pseudacteon, as well as region-specific
   tactics.}},

Abstract = {{The federally endangered northern aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis
   septentrionalis) disappeared as a breeder from its historic nesting
   range in the southwestern United States in the early to middle 1900s.
   Since 1995, a small breeding population has been restored to former
   range in South Texas grasslands, and interest has escalated in restoring
   the bird to northern Chihuahuan Desert grasslands in southeastern
   Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. In these latter areas, intensive
   livestock grazing and associated shrub (brush) encroachment have been
   theorized to have contributed importantly to the bird's demise, and thus
   grazing management has been identified as an important restoration
   issue. A review of the bird's abundance in the context of the grazing
   history of these areas suggests it was common when grazing, both by
   livestock and black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), was
   intense and widespread (1880s-1920s) in the bird's habitat. It declined
   in abundance and disappeared coincident with declines in livestock
   abundance and the extirpation of prairie dogs (1930s-1940s). Most
   locations where observers historically encountered the bird had little
   brush at the time of its demise. In the Chihuahuan Desert grasslands of
   Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas where the bird occurred
   historically, the avian prey base is presently an order of magnitude or
   more lower than that in higher-rainfall habitats of the bird in eastern
   Mexico and South Texas. The avian prey base is similarly depauperate
   where 2 small populations of aplomado falcon exist in Mexico's northern
   Chihuahuan Desert, and the bird's reproductive success there is lower
   than that in eastern Mexico. The historic extirpation of prairie dogs
   caused a reduction in the prey biomass available to diurnally feeding
   raptors such as the aplomado falcon. Efforts to restore the falcon to
   Chihuahuan Desert grasslands in the United States ideally should include
   monitoring the responses of released birds to levels of grazing, to
   shrub abundance, to prey abundance, and to black-tailed prairie dog
   colonies should any exist in release areas.}},

Abstract = {{Territorial behavior is an important component of the ecology and life
   history of some species of plethodontid salamanders. It is thought to
   mediate competition both within and between species and may ultimately
   determine which species can coexist in a given geographical region. We
   studied a crucial characteristic of territorial behavior, site tenacity,
   by monitoring a population of Rich Mountain salamanders (Plethodon
   ouachitae) in spring 1993 and 1994. We identified 54 naturally occurring
   cover objects with associated adult salamanders. We visited these cover
   objects 14 times over the 2 field seasons, observing a total of 152
   individual salamanders. Of these, 34 (22.4\%) were recaptured at least
   once. Of the 54 salamanders originally identified, 10 (18.5\%) were
   recaptured under their original cover objects at least once. Recaptured
   salamanders were found under significantly larger cover objects than
   animals that were not recaptured, and males were found under
   significantly larger cover objects than were females. Regression
   analyses revealed significant, positive relationships between size of
   cover object and total number of individual salamanders observed, total
   number of recaptures, and number of individuals recaptured. No
   relationship between size of cover object and size of salamander was
   detected. We also examined the ability of adults of R ouachitae to home
   to cover objects by displacing them 5 m from point of capture.
   Significantly more (23.8\%) of displaced salamanders returned to their
   original cover object than expected by chance.}},

Abstract = {{Chickpea, a self-pollinating diploid annual with 2n = 2x = 16
   chromosomes, is an important food legume crop throughout the world and
   especially in developing countries. A gene that confers double-podding,
   with the symbol ``s{''}, is considered important for breeding higher
   yielding cultivars. Positive effects of ``s{''} on yield stability were
   found by comparing single- and double-podded near-isogenic lines (NILs)
   derived from a cross of CA-2156 (single-podded) with JG-62
   (double-podded). Considering the significant effects on seed yield, the
   NILs were used to identify molecular markers closely linked to ``s{''}.
   Sequence tagged microsatellite site (STMS) markers developed for
   chickpea, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple
   sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were used to analyze the NILs. Out of 400
   RAPD, 100 STMS and 100 ISSR markers, one STMS marker (TA-80) was
   polymorphic and was used to evaluate a recombinant inbred line
   population developed from the cross of Surutato-77 (single-podded) x
   JG-62 (double-podded) for co-segregation of the locus with ``s{''}. Our
   results indicated that the marker and ``s{''} were 4.84 cM apart. This
   marker may be used by breeders for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to
   monitor the incorporation of the double-podding gene into improved
   germplasm.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-yr trial investigated the efficacy of fire as a control technique
   for bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypiifolia) in riparian habitats. Spring
   burns were applied in successive years (September 1999 and October
   2000), and their impact on juvenile, mature and old bellyache bush
   plants was determined. Post-fire seedling recruitment was monitored for
   21 months after the initial burn. The first fire significantly (P <
   0.05) reduced the original bellyache bush plant density by 76\% (from 10
   750 plants/ha to 2580 plants/ha). A second fire a year later extended
   the kill rate (8 months after the second burn) to 92\%, with a residual
   plant population of 860 plants/ha. Monitoring for a longer period would
   confirm the results obtained with the second burn. The relative
   sensitivity to fire was juvenile > mature > old. In contrast, seedling
   emergence was significantly (P < 0.05) increased after burning.
   Emergence in burnt plots over the wet season following the first fire
   was 2.7-fold that in unburnt controls. Even with high mortality during
   the subsequent periods, seedling density in burnt plots at the end of
   the study averaged 368 000 per ha compared with 40 000 per ha in the
   unburnt controls. It is expected that the residual population of
   bellyache bush would produce enough seed to soon reinfest the area.
   These results stress that fire should be one of a number of tools, which
   may be used for control of bellyache bush. They also highlight the need
   for development of integrated control strategies that not only treat the
   primary infestations but also the many seedlings that emerge from the
   residual soil seedbank.}},

Abstract = {{Tremendous advances have recently been made in the development of
   molecular tools for analysis of microbial populations in the
   environment. However, an appropriate scientific basis for quantification
   of new molecular data must exist to effectively use these tools toward
   increased understanding of complex waste treatment environments and
   implementation of corrective actions to maintain or improve system
   performance. In particular, molecular tools are gaining widespread use
   in the study of activated-sludge microbial communities and have the
   potential to improve monitoring and control of wastewater treatment
   processes. The authors have created a Web-accessible database, the
   Activated Sludge Biomolecular Database, which provides a scientific
   basis for interpreting activated-sludge biomolecular information. The
   database achieves its goal by accumulating and disseminating a large
   body of knowledge relating the presence and quantity of specific
   biomolecules to process design, operating conditions, and wastewater

Abstract = {{Until recently, very little was known about the basic ecology of the
   Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) in eastern North America,
   including molting locations. A combination of aerial, ground and boat
   surveys were initiated in 1989 (Quebec) and 1994 (Newfoundland and
   Labrador), and continued through 1999, to locate their molting areas.
   Molting Harlequin Ducks were found in Labrador, Newfoundland and the
   Gaspe Peninsula and Anticosti Island, Quebec. Coastal areas of southern
   Labrador, Grey Islands, northern Newfoundland, and Bonaventure and
   Anticosti Islands, southern Quebec, were the most important sites. The
   tip of northern Labrador and possibly sites along the Quebec North Shore
   and Greenland are the most likely sites where the rest of the eastern
   population molts. Molting chronology for the ducks in Quebec is similar
   to those on the east and west coast of North America. Now that these
   sites are known, monitoring and, if necessary, protection of these sites
   can be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Nearshore counts of birds on the water and time-lapse photography were
   used to monitor seasonal activity patterns and interannual variation in
   numbers of Horned Puffins (Fratercula corniculata) and Parakeet Auklets
   (Aethia psittacula) at the Semidi Islands, Alaska. The best period for
   over-water counts was mid egg-laying through hatching in auklets and
   late prelaying through early hatching in puffins. Daily counts (07.00
   h-09.30 h) varied widely, with peak numbers and days with few or no
   birds present occurring throughout the census period. Variation among
   annual means in four years amounted to 26\% and 72\% of total count
   variation in puffins and auklets, respectively. Time-lapse photography
   of nesting habitat in early incubation revealed a morning (08.00 h-12.00
   h) peak in the number of puffins loitering on study plots. Birds
   recorded in time-lapse images never comprised more than a third of the
   estimated breeding population on a plot. Components of variance in the
   time-lapse study were 29\% within hours, 9\% among hours (08.00 h-12.00
   h), and 62\% among days (8-29 June). Variability of over-water and
   land-based counts is reduced by standardizing the time of day when
   counts are made, but weather conditions had little influence on either
   type of count. High interannual variation of population indices implies
   low power to detect numerical trends in crevice-nesting auklets and
   puffins.}},

Abstract = {{An open grassland at Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, Sonoma County, CA, was
   burned during three consecutive summers (1993-1995) to control yellow
   starthistle By 1996, the yellow starthistle seedbank, seedling density,
   and mature vegetative cover were reduced by 99, 99, and 9 1 \%,
   respectively, and the plant community had greater diversity and species
   richness, particularly of native forbs After the cessation of the
   prescribed burning after 1995, the community was monitored for 4 yr to
   determine if the reduced yellow starthistle population represented a
   stable state or if the population would quickly recover The yellow
   starthistle seedbank rose dramatically over 4 yr Seedling counts and
   summer vegetative cover also rose, though less rapidly Total forb cover,
   particularly native species, total plant cover, and plant diversity
   decreased significantly after cessation of the burning Grass cover did
   not show any strong trends, and year-to-year variation in the grass
   cover appeared to be more important than the treatment effects In the
   absence of some overall changes in management, e g, periodic prescribed
   burning, herbicide treatments, or revegetation, it may not be possible
   to establish and maintain a stable state with a low population of yellow
   starthistle in annual grasslands in California.}},

Abstract = {{Florida apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) apparently have only a limited
   tolerance to wetland drying events (although little direct evidence
   exists), but their populations routinely face dry downs under natural
   and managed water regimes. In this paper, we address speculation that
   apple snails respond to decreasing water levels and potential drying
   events by moving toward refugia that remain inundated. We monitored the
   movements of apple snails in central Florida, USA during drying events
   at the Blue Cypress Marsh (BC) and at Lake Kissimmee (LK). We monitored
   the weekly movements of 47 BC snails and 31 LK snails using
   radio-telemetry. Snails tended to stop moving when water depths were <
   10 cm; however, there was no apparent effect of water depth on distance
   traveled in water depths >10 cm. Snails moved along the greatest
   positive depth gradient (i.e., towards deeper water) when they
   encountered water depths between 10 and 20 cm. Snails tended to move
   toward shallower water in water depths greater than or equal to50 cm,
   suggesting that snails were avoiding deep water areas such as canals and
   sloughs. Of the 11 BC snails originally located in the area that
   eventually went dry, three (27\%) were found in deep water refugia by
   the end of the study. Only one of the 31 LK snails escaped the drying
   event by moving to deeper water. Our results indicate that some snails
   may opportunistically escape drying events through movement. The
   tendency to move toward deeper water was statistically significant and
   indicates that this behavioral trait might enhance survival when the
   spatial extent of a dry down is limited. However, as water level falls
   below 10 cm, snails stop moving and become stranded. As the spatial
   extent of a dry down increases, we predict that the number of snails
   stranded would increase proportionally. Stranded Pomacea paludosa must
   contend with dry marsh conditions, possibly by aestivation. Little more
   than anecdotal information has been published on P. paludosa
   aestivation, but it is a common adaptation among other apple snails
   (Caenogastropoda: Ampullaridae).}},

Abstract = {{The Northern Region Landbird Monitoring Program (NRLMP) has been in
   place for nearly a decade. Based on our experience with this program, we
   offer thoughts on monitoring goals, the need for regional programs, and
   the components we believe make count-based monitoring effective. The
   NRLMP includes a biennial bird survey conducted from permanently marked
   points for the purposes of long-term population-trend monitoring. Its
   primary strength, however, emerges from the inclusion of habitat
   information at each survey point, which allows rapid inference about
   land-use effects, and from an alternate-year focus on short-term
   management effects studies. Those who may be planning to initiate a
   regional monitoring program may want to incorporate some of the
   perceived strengths of, and methodology associated with, the NRLMP while
   avoiding some of the pitfalls we have encountered. The power to detect
   both population trends and management effects might then emerge not only
   from the efforts of individual, regionally based programs but also from
   the collective effort of a variety of similarly designed regional
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the efficacy of translocation to control an urban
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population in Town and
   Country (TC), Missouri. Captured deer (n=80) were fitted with
   radiotransmitters and translocated approximately 160 km to Huzzah
   Conservation Area (HC) in south-central Missouri. Released deer were
   monitored on a 20-hour sampling regime for 1 year. Annual survival was
   0.30 (SE=0.05) for translocated deer and 0.69 (SE=0.05) for radiomarked
   resident TC deer that were not translocated. Mortality causes for the 55
   translocated deer that died during the study were hunting (33\%),
   capture myopathy (29\%), poaching (13\%), unknown causes (11\%),
   roadkill (9\%), and wounding from hunting (5\%). Mortality causes for
   the 25 resident deer that died during the study were roadkill (68\%),
   hunting (12\%), unknown causes (8\%), fences (8\%), and wounding from
   hunting (4\%). Post-translocation home range size increased (0.86 km(2)
   vs. 2.5 km(2)), and fawn recruitment by translocated adult females was
   higher (Z=2.88, P<0.01) than for TC resident deer. Cost per translocated
   deer was \$387. The use of translocation for controlling urban deer
   populations was costly relative to other methods and may result in
   significant mortality from capture myopathy and human activities at
   release sites.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring programs aimed at indicator species like the American marten
   (Martes americana) may index ecosystem conditions throughout the
   animal's range. Habitat-relation models may be useful to monitor
   indicator species and their habitats temporally. We constructed and
   field-tested a habitat-relation model for American martens to determine
   current distribution of the species in the Black Hills, South Dakota and
   establish baseline data for the population. We conducted a
   track-plate-box survey, selecting survey quadrats using the model, field
   reconnaissance, and area used by radiocollared martens. We performed
   stepwise logistic regression to test the model and predict the presence
   of martens in random quadrats throughout the study area and in quadrats
   surveyed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest
   Service. Of 46 10.2-km(2) quadrats surveyed, 14 (30\%) had boxes visited
   by martens. High-quality habitat was positively and low-quality habitat
   negatively correlated to martens' presence. Logistic model coefficients
   predicted that martens would be detected in 6 of 68 (9\%) random
   quadrats. When field-tested (post-analysis), the model correctly
   predicted outcomes for 3 (60\%) of 5 quadrats surveyed.}},

Abstract = {{The Grampians pincushion lily (Borya mirabilis Churchill) is a
   resurrection plant confined to one population at a single rock outcrop
   in western Victoria. It is a taxonomically well-defined species and
   geographically widely separated from its most closely related congeners
   in the south-west of Western Australia. Monitoring over a 12-month
   period showed a significant decline in population condition that was
   associated with soil disturbance and damage to associated vegetation.
   Although able to reproduce vegetatively, B. mirabilis is not known to
   produce viable seed. Molecular work revealed that all plants in the
   population were likely to be genetically identical. Investigation of the
   breeding system showed that pollen viability was low and pollen tube
   growth was possibly insufficient to fertilise ovules. One explanation
   for lack of effective sexual reproduction is the presence of a mechanism
   for self-incompatibility. The decline in population condition and lack
   of ramet establishment at present are predominantly a result of high
   levels of ground disturbance from pest animals. Without active and
   immediate site management the population is likely to become extinct
   under current circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of salinity on
   cadmium (Cd) accumulation and metallothionein (MT) expression in the
   dogwhelk Nucella lapillus (L.). Adult dogwhelks (shell length: 23.4 +/-
   1.3 mm) were acclimated to salinity of 33 psu (control), 22 or 11 psu
   under controlled laboratory conditions (9.5 degreesC; pH 7.9) for 10
   days in a stepwise manner by reducing the salinity by 5.5 psu day(-1).
   Ten treatment groups were used and comprised five salinity regimes
   (three fixed salinity {[}33, 22 or 11 psu] and two fluctuating salinity
   {[}varied daily between 33 and 22 psu or 33 and 11 psu in a cyclic
   manner]) at each of two Cd concentrations (control: <0.001 mug Cd l(-1)
   or treatment: 500 mug Cd l(-1)). After acclimation, group, of 20
   dogwhelks were exposed to each of the 10 Cd/salinity combinations. All
   the control and Cd-exposed dogwhelks exposed to 11 psu were dead within
   5 days of exposure due to hypo-osmotic stress. Twenty days after
   exposure to all other treatments, concentrations of Cd and MTs in the
   tissues of surviving dogwhelks were quantified using atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry and the silver saturation method, respectively. Both
   Cd accumulation and MT induction in control or Cd-exposed N. lapillus
   were significantly influenced by changes in salinity, especially at a
   prolonged and fixed low salinity (22 psu), although such influences of
   salinity on the concentration of MTs were dependent on the tissue type.
   The study highlights that salinity should be considered when monitoring
   trace metals and/or MTs in intertidal molluscs, particularly in
   estuarine or transplanted biomonitors, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {{The role of DDE, PCB, coplanar PCB and eggshell parameters for

Abstract = {{The reproduction of white-tailed sea eagles was monitored in 1964-1999
   in 3 differently contaminated sub-populations: Baltic Sea coast (Bp),
   inland central Sweden (lp) and Lapland (Lp). 249 dead eggs from 205
   clutches were obtained for analyses of DDE and PCBs and for eggshell
   measurements. A desiccation index (D-i) value was calculated for each
   egg as a measure of water loss through the shell. In the highly
   contaminated Bp, p,p'-DDE concentrations in the eggs decreased
   continuously and 5-fold during the study period and PCB concentrations
   decreased 3-fold from the mid 1980s. The PCB pattern changed slightly
   over time towards more high-chlorinated congeners but the relative
   toxicity of the PCB mixture, expressed as
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQ), remained constant
   and TEO can be assumed to have decreased in a similar way as PCB over
   time. Productivity (P), shell thickness (S-i) shell index (S-i) and D-i
   increased over time in the Bp but no change in Di or productivity
   occurred in the Lp, where residue concentrations were 5-8 times lower. P
   of the Bp was not correlated to S-t or S, but was negatively correlated
   to Di, DDE and PCB. An S-shaped dose-response relationship was indicated
   between P and DDE. After 1988, when the PCB/DDE ratio was considerably
   higher than previously, PCB but not DDE concentrations were
   significantly higher in eggs with dead embryos as compared to
   undeveloped eggs, implying lethal concentrations of PCB, and a LOEL of
   320 pg 9 1 TEO is suggested for embryo mortality. In a subset of 21
   eggs, representing productive and unproductive females, analyzed for a
   selection of coplanar PCB congeners, tris(4-chlorophenyl) methanol and
   bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulphone, there was no evidence for a correlation
   between P and any of these compounds. A reduction in residue
   concentrations in old females did not lead to increased P or improved
   D-i-values, indicating a remaining effect from a previous, higher
   exposure to contaminants. The inability to reproduce included a high
   rate of undeveloped eggs, indicating effects at a prezygotic stage. P
   showed the strongest correlation with 131, and Di was most strongly
   correlated to DDE. Thus, the remaining effect of previous exposure
   resulted in a stronger correlation to the symptom (D-i) rather than to
   the suggested causative agent (DDE). LOEL values for depressed P were
   estimated at 120 mug g(-1) DDE and 500 mug 9(-1) PCB (lipid basis). It
   is concluded that the major reason for depressed P during the study
   period was DDE, but that effects also from PCB were largely concealed by
   the effects from DDE.}},

Abstract = {{Logging and poaching have dramatically reduced chimpanzee density and
   distribution in the Republic of Congo. Most chimpanzee translocations
   attempted in the past failed because a number of biological and
   non-biological factors can influence success. Biological considerations
   include knowledge of behaviour, disease, habitat requirements and
   genetics. We critically review genetic considerations in pre- and
   post-release phases of translocations and apply them to a welfare-based
   chimpanzee release project in the Republic of Congo which aimed to
   re-establish orphan chimpanzees in the wild with a native chimpanzee
   population. We analyze genetic diversity and relatedness in released
   animals and devise a genotyping strategy for monitoring of released
   individuals and their future offspring. Fifty-nine confiscated
   chimpanzees from different areas of the Republic of Congo were typed for
   20 microsatellites using plucked hair as the DNA source. Genetic
   diversity was high, with an average expected heterozygosity of 81\%, and
   three to 18 alleles per locus. Between 1996 and 1998, 19 individuals
   were released, and genetic analysis showed that these are unrelated
   (mean r +/- jack-knifed SD = -0.014 +/- 0.001). Using F-ST and
   population admixture analysis, we identified population structure in
   wild chimpanzees. For long-term genetic monitoring of released and
   native chimpanzees, we identified a set of six informative markers,
   which are easy to score using basic techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The sublethal toxicity associated with exposure of adult lake whitefish
   (Coregonus clupeaformis) to diets containing 0, 10, 100, and 1000 mug Ni
   per g for 10, 3 1, and 104 days was assessed through the measurement of
   responses, through a range of levels of biological organization. The
   accumulation and distribution of Ni in these fish are described in the
   previous manuscript (Ptashynski and Klaverkamp, 2001. Aquat. Toxicol. in
   press). Hematological parameters, including concentrations of glucose
   and hemoglobin and hematocrit, were not different between control and
   treated fish. Organ and whole organism parameters, including LSI,
   growth, and condition factor, were also unaffected. Histopathological
   lesions in kidney and liver proved to be the most sensitive and reliable
   indicators of Ni exposure. In livers of treated fish, areas of focal
   necrosis and altered bile ducts were observed. Histological alterations
   were observed throughout the posterior kidneys, in glomeruli, tubules,
   collecting ducts, and hematopoietic tissue, in fish fed medium and high
   dose diets. In whitefish kidneys, the frequency (\%) of altered distal
   tubules and fields of views with alterations increased with the dose and
   duration of exposure. Significant increases in metallothionein
   concentrations were observed in intestine of whitefish fed the high dose
   diet on day 10, but these increases were not sustained. Significant
   increases in lipid peroxide concentrations were also observed in plasma
   of whitefish fed the high dose diet on day 31, but were not observed on
   day 104. These biochemical responses to dietary Ni require further
   evaluation. To evaluate exposure of natural populations of fish to Ni,
   analysis of Ni in kidney and liver and assessment of renal and hepatic
   histopathology are recommended for use in field bio-monitoring programs.

Abstract = {{African wildlife populations and their habitats are dwindling outside of
   state-protected areas due to escalating human demands on natural
   resources, while the effective enforcement of conservation legislation
   is impracticable across most of the continent. A particular conservation
   crisis is looming in southern Africa, where extensive wildlife areas are
   rapidly giving way to subsistence agropastoralism. The concept of
   community-based wildlife management (CBWM) has been embraced by donor
   agencies as a hopeful solution in areas where adequate wildlife
   resources persist and agricultural potential is marginal. The
   conservation value of CBWM depends, however, on communities having
   specific information to evaluate the sustainable benefits of wildlife in
   comparison with alternative landuse options. Furthermore, simple but
   scientifically sound monitoring procedures are required to ensure that
   the offtake from wildlife populations is kept within sustainable limits.
   This paper draws together key ecological issues of relevance to CBWM in
   southern African savannas and identifies topics requiring further
   attention from ecologists. The aim is to assist conservation and
   development agencies in providing prompt and appropriate technical
   support to communities in areas where opportunities for CBWM still exist
   but could soon be foreclosed.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first assessment of the status of cheetahs, Acinonyx
   jubatus, in Tanzania since 1965. It completes a series of recent studies
   in Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi to provide an overall understanding of the
   species' status in East Africa. Interviews with 370 informants yielded
   1050 cheetah sightings. Eighty nine percent of all sightings were made
   in 1990-1994, and 39\% of all sightings occurred in protected areas.
   All-adult groups contained 1.92 +/- 0.04 S.D. individuals; the average
   number of dependent cubs was 2.63 +/- 0.08 S.D.; and the cub-to-adult
   ratio was 0.34. Since the 1960s, the distribution has remained stable
   overall with possible reductions in central Tanzania. No definite
   population trends were detected. With an estimated 569-1007 cheetahs,
   Tanzania emerges as a sanctuary for the species worldwide. However
   rangelands, which may hold half of Tanzania's cheetahs, are undergoing
   rapid degradation. This precarious situation calls for the establishment
   of a nationwide monitoring program. Distribution map and population
   sizes from this study could serve as a baseline for monitoring the
   species' status. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The garden tiger moth (Arctia caja) was once widespread and common in
   the UK. Data collected using the standard light-traps of the Rothamsted
   Insect Survey over Great Britain from 1968 to 1998 showed that A. caja
   abundance fluctuated near 4.2 captures per site until 1983, and then
   fell 28\% to an average of 3.0 captures per site after 1984. The
   collated index, frequently used to monitor UK butterfly abundance, was
   not suitable to detect this large, 1-year population change. Four years
   after the sudden decrease in abundance, the proportion of sites occupied
   also fell rapidly from an average of 0.60 to an average of 0.42 (30\%).
   Contrary to most UK butterflies, which are expected to increase under
   the UK climate change scenarios of global warming, linear regression
   modelling showed that warm, wet winters and springs may be detrimental
   to A. caja and it is therefore predicted to decrease further. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Clonal propagation and limited dispersal of seeds lead to genetic
   population structures in which most potential mates are relatives. If
   the species suffers from inbreeding depression or is self-incompatible,
   the number of seeds matured per fruit may be limited by the lack of
   outcrossing by unrelated pollen. We tested for distance-related genetic
   structure by hand-pollinating plants at increasing distances and
   measuring fruit set (berries/pollinated flowers) and seed number per
   fruit in natural populations of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) and
   lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Bagging of the flower buds
   without natural (pollination by insects) or hand-pollination yielded
   almost no fruit or seed, suggesting that the species are obligately
   insect pollinated. Self-pollination led to a significant reduction in
   seed number per fruit and increased seed abortion compared with
   cross-pollination. Moreover, seed number increased with increasing
   distance between the pollen donor and pollen recipient. Flight distances
   of bumblebees were estimated for bilberry by monitoring between-flower
   and, for lingonberry, between-inflorescence flight distances. About 90\%
   of all flights were at distances of less than 1 m. At this distance, we
   observed less than the maximum seed number per fruit in
   hand-pollinations in both study species. Consequently, clonal growth is
   likely to be an important factor that constrains fruit and seed number
   in these species.}},

Abstract = {{Snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations were monitored from 1977 to
   2001 on Jacquot Island (5 km(2)) in Kluane Lake, southwestern Yukon, and
   on nearby mainland sites. Jacquot Island hares averaged twice the
   density of mainland control populations and, although they show 10-year
   cycles, fluctuate with much lower amplitude than mainland populations.
   Three separate intensive studies over 6 years attempted to determine
   what caused these differences. We tested two hypotheses to explain the
   dynamics. Reproductive rates of hares were similar on Jacquot Island and
   the mainland. Adult survival rates were higher on the island in most
   years, with the exception of years of population decline. Juvenile
   survival rates from 0 to 30 days of life were much higher on the island
   than on the mainland except for decline summers. The adult- and
   juvenile-survival differences between the island and the mainland were
   explained most consistently by predation. Improved survival on the
   island is correlated with a reduction in the numbers and types of
   predators found on Jacquot Island compared with the mainland. In
   particular, red squirrels were rare on Jacquot Island, arctic ground
   squirrels were absent, and the larger predators, like lynx and
   great-horned owls, were sporadic in occurrence on this small island.}},

Abstract = {{Population fluctuations may occur in synchrony among several rodent
   species at a given site, and they may occur in synchrony over large
   geographical areas. We summarize information on synchrony in lemmings
   and voles from the Canadian Arctic for the past 20 years. The most
   detailed available information is from the central Canadian Arctic,
   where snap-trap samples have been taken annually at several sites for
   periods of up to 15 years. Geographical synchrony in the same species
   among different sites was strong, especially for the central and eastern
   Canadian Arctic. Synchrony among different species at a given site was
   also generally high. When one species is at high density, densities of
   all species at that site tend to be high. These results do not easily
   fit the mobile-predator hypothesis proposed to explain regional
   synchrony, and are more consistent with the weather hypothesis, which we
   suggest both entrains synchrony among sites and enforces synchrony among
   species within a site. We tentatively support the weather hypothesis for
   geographical synchrony in lemmings, and recommend the establishment of a
   circumpolar program to monitor lemming cycles and predator movements
   that would advance our understanding of these large-scale patterns of
   cyclic synchrony.}},

Abstract = {{The demography of Zenaida Doves (Zenaida aurita) was studied on Cayo del
   Agua, Culebra, Puerto Rico. We collected capture-recapture and
   reproductive success data and monitored annual changes in the density of
   ground nests in 1987-1993 and 2000. Models with time-specific apparent
   survival and constant capture rates ((phi) over cap (t), (p) over cap
   (c)) and constant apparent survival and time-specific capture rates were
   equally parsimonious, with the former having 1.5 times more support from
   the data. Rainfall of the first six months of the year was positively
   related to nest density, and crab density was negatively related to
   nesting success and the number of doves fledged per nest. Crabs are the
   main predators of dove nests on Cayo del Agua. Models, parameterized
   with field data, were used to simulate full and reduced stochastic
   variation in environmental and demographic conditions, and predict
   annual changes in population size. High recruitment (births or births +
   immigrants) offset high losses (deaths + emigrants) in all instances.
   Our field data suggest that Zenaida Doves suffered an ecological crunch
   between 1989 and 1990, when weather (a hurricane followed by a drought),
   food availability, and nest predation interacted, lowering the number of
   locally fledged doves that survived the hatching year (1989-1990) and
   reproductive success (1990). Under severe conditions, population size
   and recovery mainly depended on immigration. Apparent survival returned
   to pre-hurricane levels between 1990 and 1991, and reproductive success
   was about average in 1991.}},

Title = {{Establishing a new wild population of tuatara (Sphenodon guntheri )}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{887-894}},

Abstract = {{Translocations of reptiles and amphibians have been questioned as a
   conservation tool because they generally have not been successful.
   However, translocation is the only method by which many species can be
   restored to parts of their former range, which increases their
   conservation security. Tuatara (Sphenodon spp.), sole surviving members
   of the reptilian Order Sphenodontia, are restricted to offshore islands
   of New Zealand. Dispersal into former habitat on the mainland or other
   islands, following removal of the causes of extinction, is unlikely.
   Captive rearing of reptile hatchlings from eggs collected in the wild to
   produce founders for new populations is also a conservation technique
   that has had mixed success. However, captive incubation and rearing are
   techniques that allow large numbers of tuatara to be produced to start
   new populations without detrimental effects on small source populations.
   We document the first contemporary translocation of S. guntheri ,
   providing details on selection of release sites and founders. Release
   sites were chosen on a rodent-free island that provided a variety of
   habitats for tuatara as well as abundant food and shelter. The release
   propagule comprised 18 wild-caught adults and 50 captive-reared
   juveniles. Four separate release sites were established to separate
   adults from juveniles during the establishment phase. Five years of
   monitoring indicate that at least 57\% of tuatara survived translocation
   and that reproduction has occurred on the new island. All tuatara
   increased in weight and length, demonstrating that tuatara have an
   indeterminate growth pattern. The 56\% of recaptured juveniles
   represented a cross section of the sizes released. We evaluated the use
   of head-started juveniles as founders, based on survival and growth
   data. Because tuatara are long-lived, late-maturing reptiles with slow
   reproduction, establishment of a self-sustaining population will take
   decades of monitoring to confirm.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models predict that a delayed density-dependent mortality
   factor with a time lag of ca 9 months is able to drive 3-5-yr population
   cycles of northern votes. We studied numerical responses of predators in
   western Finland during 1986-92. in an area with 3-yr Population cycles
   of voles. Abundances of small mammals were monitored in several farmland
   areas (each 3 km(2)) by snap-trapping in April, June, August, and
   October (only in 1986-90), and the abundances of avian. mammalian, and
   reptilian predators by visual censuses during trapping occasions. The
   3-yr cycle studied was a cycle of Microtus votes (field vote M. agrestis
   and sibling vole M. rossiaemeridionalis) and their small-sized predators
   (small mustelids and vole-eating birds of prey). The numerical responses
   of both migratory avian predators and small mustelids to changes in vole
   densities were more alike than different. In late summer (August). the
   time lag in the numerical response of all main predators was short (0-4
   months), whereas longer time lags prevailed from spring to early summer.
   The length of the time lag in spring, appeared to be related to the
   length of the winter. which indicates that strong seasonality may create
   longer time lags to the numerical response of predators at northern
   latitudes than at more Southern latitudes. Our results Suggest that.
   from spring to early summer. predation by migratory avian predators may
   act in concordance with mustelid predation to produce the long time lag
   necessary to drive the 3-yr cycle of votes, whereas almost direct
   density-dependent predation by all major predators in late summer may
   dampen spatial variation in prey densities.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated whether local biotic and abiotic conditions could
   explain the occurrence of calling males of the declining spadefoot toad
   Pelobates fuscus in 72 ponds in southern Sweden. The ponds covered the
   entire distribution range of P. fuscus and were monitored during the
   breeding season in 2000. Calling males were found in 33 ponds.
   representing ca 50\% of all known ponds for the species ill Sweden. They
   had a non-random distribution and a discriminant analysis including 19
   environmental variables successfully classified 86\% of the ponds as
   with or without calling males A stepwise discriminant analysis selected
   eight of these variables and classified 85\% of the ponds correctly.
   ponds with calling males were classified mainly on characteristics of
   the ponds, whereas composition of the terrestrial habitat close to the
   ponds and traffic load within 500 in had little influence on the
   distribution of calling males. Ponds with P. fuscus were large,
   permanent and eutrophic with high concentrations of oxygen and high
   spring temperatures. They also had a high proportion of shoreline with
   steep banks. Permanent ponds with calling males typically had a low
   abundance of predatory fish and crayfish: only two of the ponds with P.
   fuscus contained predatory fish. The results of this study indicate that
   interactions between physical factors (e.g. pond drying) and predation
   determine the presence of P. fuscus. Because P. fuscus has specific
   habitat requirements necessary for its survival and high site fidelity,
   it is particularly vulnerable to local changes in the condition of its
   natural breeding ponds. The situation is particularly serious for this
   species because the majority of the ponds that are within its dispersal
   range do not seem to be suitable for P. fuscus because of physical
   constraints.}},

Title = {{Predation on a common Anolis lizard: Can the food-web effects of a

Abstract = {{We artificially invaded a set of small islands with the large lizard
   Leiocephalus carinatus to determine effects on food-web elements
   including an intermediate predator, the lizard Anolis sagrei; the latter
   was previously found to have major, mostly direct effects on web
   spiders, as well as detectable indirect effects on aerial arthropods
   (including parasitoids) and leaf damage. In addition to these food-web
   elements, we monitored ground-surface arthropods; they are expected to
   be affected directly; as well as indirectly via A. sagrei, by L.
   carinatus. Five islands were randomly selected for invasion while six
   others served as controls. In addition, four islands without A. sagrei
   were monitored to determine the natural state of the sagrei-free food
   web. We also monitored a variety of A. sagrei's traits, from behavioral
   through physiological and demographic to morphological, to elucidate the
   mechanisms whereby L. carinatus might affect the smaller lizard and to
   evaluate trait-mediated as well as density-mediated effects.
   Comparison of unmanipulated islands with and without A. sagrei showed
   that A. sagrei appeared to be affecting web-spider density and
   diversity, numbers of small aerial arthropods, number of large
   ground-surface arthropods, and two types of leaf damage, scars and
   mines. All effects were negative save one: Small aerial arthropods were
   more abundant with A. sagrei; this variable and parasitoid abundance
   were negatively related to web-spider density, implicating an indirect
   effect pathway from A. sagrei via web spiders.
   Introduction of L. carinatus had major and immediate effects on A.
   sagrei density and perch height; effects on perch diameter, percentage
   hatchlings, and the width of the body,size distribution followed over
   time. Behavioral shifts in habitat use continued to the end of the
   experiment, after changes in population density had mostly leveled off.
   Adult-male body condition became poorer after introduction of L.
   carinatus. Among islands, percentage use of the ground was correlated
   negatively with percentage vegetated area of the island and positively
   with premanipulation relative hindlimb length. We hypothesize that
   longer-legged individuals do better on the ground because they are
   faster there. Conditional evidence for an increase in adult-male
   relative hindlimb length suggested that, when the ground-inhabiting L.
   carinatus was introduced, such individuals were differentially able to
   escape predation.
   Introduction of L. carinatus significantly reversed A. sagrei's effect
   on number of species and density of web, spiders but had no other major
   effects on lower level food-web elements. Thus, a relatively
   short-chained (two links) effect, with a relatively strong second link
   (A. sagrei on spiders), showed the greatest indirect effect of the
   manipulation. Another potentially strong indirect effect, that on large
   ground-surface arthropods, did not occur, possibly because of
   compensatory (direct) predation by L. carinatus. Thus presence of
   omnivory may also be relevant to whether reversal of effects occurs.
   Although most A. sagrei effects were not reversed in the time available
   for the experiment, this may be typical, as natural L. carinatus
   colonizations can dwindle away to extinction over about the same time
   span, producing at best only short-term indirect effects.
   Population-density estimates from other sites and comparisons to other
   experimental studies suggest that, in general, predators on Anolis may
   have erratic effects in space and time.}},

Abstract = {{Nondetection of a species at a site does not imply that the species is
   absent unless the probability of detection is 1. We propose a model and
   likelihood-based method for estimating site occupancy rates when
   detection probabilities are < 1. The model provides a flexible framework
   enabling covariate information to be included and allowing for missing
   observations. Via computer simulation, we found that the model provides
   good estimates of the occupancy rates, generally unbiased for moderate
   detection probabilities (>0.3). We estimated site occupancy rates for
   two anuran species at 32 wetland sites in Maryland, USA, from data
   collected during 2000 as part of an amphibian monitoring, program,
   Frog-watch USA. Site occupancy rates were estimated as 0.49 for American
   toads (Bufo americanas), a 44\% increase over the proportion of sites at
   which they were actually observed. and as 0.85 for spring, peepers
   (Pseudacris crucifier), slightly above the observed proportion of 0.83.}},

Abstract = {{The predation potential of small mammals, in particular mice, Peromyscus
   spp., and invertebrates, was evaluated from 1992 to 1995 near the
   leading edge of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), spread into the
   southeastern United States. Two study sites were established in each of
   three geographic areas: the coastal plain, Piedmont, and mountains. All
   sites were mixed hardwood stands,, with varying amounts of oak, Quercus
   spp., and all were classified for gypsy moth susceptibility. Small
   mammal density was estimated using Sherman live-traps and pitfall traps
   within these 4.68-ha sites in early and late summer. Each site contained
   75 trapping stations located on a 25-m grid. Predation was measured by
   offering freeze-dried gypsy moth pupae near trapping stations at four
   heights (0, 0.25, 1.0, and 2.0 m) on different tree boles. Pupal
   predation was monitored for three consecutive nights. Vertebrate
   predation was positively correlated with good mast production in the
   previous autumn. Predation data showed that when mice were at high
   densities they were the major source of pupal predation. However, within
   these southern sites, when densities of Peromyscus spp. were low,
   predation by invertebrates was occasionally greater than predation by
   vertebrates. These data suggest that in some years invertebrates may
   retard gypsy moth buildup when small mammals are scarce due to mast crop
   failures.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality in the Pleasant Grove Spring karst groundwater basin,
   Logan County, Kentucky, was monitored to determine the effectiveness of
   best management practices (BMPs) in protecting karst aquifers.
   Ninety-two percent of the 4,069-ha (10,054-acre) watershed is used for
   agriculture. Water-quality monitoring began in October 1992 and ended in
   November 1998. By the fall of 1995 approximately 72\% of the watershed
   was enrolled in BMPs sponsored by the US Department of Agriculture Water
   Quality Incentive Program (WQIP). Pre-BMP nitrate-nitrogen concentration
   averaged 4.65 mg/l. The median total suspended solids concentration was
   127 mg/l. The median triazine concentration measured by immunosorbent
   assay was 1.44 mug/l. Median bacteria counts were 418 colonies per 100
   ml (col/100 ml) for fecal coliform, and 540 col/100 ml for fecal
   streptococci. Post-BMP, the average nitrate-nitrogen concentration was
   4.74 mg/l. The median total suspended solids concentration was 47.8
   mg/l. The median triazine concentration for the post-BMP period was 1.48
   mug/l. The median fecal coliform count increased to 432 col/100 ml after
   BMP implementation, but the median fecal streptococci count decreased to
   441 col/100 ml. The pre- and post-BMP water quality was statistically
   evaluated by comparing the annual mass flux, annual descriptive
   statistics, and population of analyses for the two periods.
   Nitrate-nitrogen concentration was unchanged. Increases in
   atrazine-equivalent flux and triazine geometric averages were not
   statistically significant. Total suspended solids concentration
   decreased slightly, whereas orthophosphate concentration increased
   slightly. Fecal I streptococci counts were reduced. The BMPs were only
   partially successful because the types available and the rules for
   participation resulted in less effective BMPs being chosen. Future BMP
   programs in karst areas should emphasize buffer strips around sinkholes,
   excluding livestock from streams and karst windows, and withdrawing land
   from production.}},

Abstract = {{We review critical issues that must be considered when selecting
   indicator species for a monitoring program that aims to maintain or
   restore ecological integrity. First, we examine the pros and cons of
   different management approaches on which a conservation program can be
   based and conclude that ecosystem management is most appropriate. We
   then identify potential indicators of ecological integrity at various
   levels of the ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on the species
   level. We conclude that, although the use of indicator species remains
   contentious, it can be useful if (1) many species representing various
   taxa and life histories are included in the monitoring program, (2)
   their selection is primarily based on a sound quantitative database from
   the focal region, and (3) caution is applied when interpreting their
   population trends to distinguish actual signals from variations that may
   be unrelated to the deterioration of ecological integrity. Finally, we
   present and discuss different methods that have been used to select
   indicator species.}},

Abstract = {{Toxin-forming species of freshwater cyanobacteria have been detected in
   all parts of Germany. Because of the high number of lakes (more than
   2000) in Baden-Wurttemberg, in southwestern Germany, only a
   representative selection of lakes (155) was intensively monitored for
   mass development of cyanobacteria and the formation of toxins in 1999.
   Nutrients, dominant algal species, chlorophyll, and toxins were
   determined from waters with cyanobacterial blooms. Toxin analyses were
   performed using HPLC, the PP1 inhibition test, and the microcystin
   ELISA. In 45\% of the monitored lakes, the phytoplankton assemblage
   consisted mainly of cyanobacteria; in an additional 24\% of the lakes
   cyanobacteria were detected. More than 26\% of the lakes contained
   toxigenic cyanobacteria. The highest amount of microcystins detected
   outside scum areas was 11-560 mug/L. In relation to biomass,
   cyanobacteria contained up to 1100 mug/g dry matter and up to 2.6 mug/Ag
   Chl a. The dominant form of microcystin detected was microcystin-LR, one
   of the most toxic known microcystins. The results of the present study
   have been used to develop a stepwise monitoring scheme for lakes with
   permanent cyanobacterial populations to protect human health and
   livestock. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we describe an approach for predicting average hourly
   concentrations of ambient PM10 in Vancouver. We know our solution also
   applies to hourly ozone fields and believe it may be quite generally
   applicable. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach. At the primary
   level we model the logarithmic field as a trend model plus Gaussian
   stochastic residual. That trend model depends on hourly meteorological
   predictors and is common to all sites. The stochastic component consists
   of a 24-hour vector response that we model as a multivariate AR(3)
   temporal process with common spatial parameters. Removing the trend and
   AR structure leaves `whitened' time series of vector series. With this
   approach (as opposed to using 24 separate univariate time series
   models), there is little loss of spatial correlation in these residuals
   compared with that in just the detrended residuals (prior to removing
   the AR component). Moreover our multivariate approach enables
   predictions for any given hour to `borrow strength' through its
   correlation with adjoining hours. On this basis we develop a spatial
   predictive distribution for these residuals at unmonitored sites. By
   transforming the predicted residuals back to the original data scales we
   can impute Vancouver's hourly PM10 field. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The utility of absorbance and fluorescence-emission spectra for
   discriminating among microalgal phylogenetic groups, selected species,
   and phycobilin- and non-phycobilin-containing algae was examined using
   laboratory cultures. A similarity index algorithm, in conjunction with
   fourth-derivative transformation of absorbance spectra, provided
   discrimination among the chlorophyll {[}Chl] a/phycobilin
   (cyanobacteria), Chl a/Chl c/phycobilin (cryptophytes), Chl a/Chl h
   (chlorophytes, euglenophytes, prasinophytes), Chl a/Chl c/fucoxanthin
   (diatoms, chrysophytes, raphidophytes) and Chl a/Chl c/peridinin
   (dinoflagellates) spectral classes, and often between/among closely
   related phylogenetic groups within a class. Spectra for phylogenetic
   groups within the Chl a/Chl c/fucoxanthin, Chl a/Chl c/peridinin, Chl
   a/phycobilins and Chl a/Chl c/phycobilin classes were most
   distinguishable from spectra for groups within the Chl a/Chl b spectral
   class. Chrysophytes/diatoms/raphiclophytes and dinoflagellates (groups
   within the comparable spectral classes, Chl a/Chl c/fucoxanthin and Chl
   a/Chl c/peridinin, respectively) displayed the greatest similarity
   between/among groups. Spectra for phylogenetic groups within the Chl
   a/Chl c classes displayed limited similarity with spectra for groups
   within the Chl/phycobilin classes. Among the cyanobacteria and
   chlorophytes surveyed, absorbance spectra of species possessing
   dissimilar cell morphologies were discriminated, with the greatest range
   of differentiation occurring among cyanobacteria. Among the
   cyanobacteria, spectra for selected problematic species were easily
   discriminated from spectra from each other and from other cyanobacteria.
   Fluorescence-emission spectra were distinct among spectral classes and
   the similarity comparisons involving fourth-derivative transformation of
   spectra discriminated the increasing contribution of distinct
   cyanobacterial species and between phycobilin- and
   non-phycobilin-containing species within a hypothetical mixed
   assemblage. These results were used to elucidate the application for in
   situ moored instrumentation incorporating such approaches in water
   quality monitoring programmes, particularly those targeting problematic
   cyanobacterial blooms.}},

Abstract = {{Luoma suggested 25 years ago that tolerant populations could be used to
   detect adverse ecological effects of pollution. Despite the apparent
   attractiveness of the idea, there have been few successful examples of
   its use and a number of failures. Pollution-tolerant, populations are
   limited almost entirely to areas that are grossly contaminated with one
   or a small number of substances and have flora and fauna that are
   severely impoverished. Tolerance does provide strong evidence of impact
   by a particular contaminant but is of limited value as a monitoring
   tool. Instances of evolved tolerance do, however, have a valuable role
   to play in environmental risk assessment. They provide model systems for
   understanding the impact of pollutants on the physiology and performance
   of individuals and in consequence how they produce effects at the
   population and. community. level, in the way that metal tolerance in
   plants has been used as a model system for the study of evolution.
   Pollution-induced community tolerance has more promise than population
   tolerance as a tool for monitoring the effects of pollution, and already
   has a much longer list of successful applications despite its shorter
   history.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term temporal variation in the community structure of fish species
   richness over the period 1953-1994 along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast
   is analysed in relation to abiotic environmental factors (oxygen
   saturation, salinity and temperature respectively at the sea surface, 10
   and 50 m depth). Data on the observed number of fish species derive from
   a long-term and ongoing beach-seine monitoring programme being conducted
   each autumn. Data on observed fish species richness are analysed using
   multivariate techniques especially designed for the coupling of
   environmental and biological tables (Co-inertia analysis). The
   correlation structure of the abiotic variables is investigated by
   applying the STATIS ({''}Structuration des Tableaux A Trois Indices de
   la Statistique{''}) multivariate technique. We demonstrate that
   environmental variables in the deeper waters are linked to the community
   structure of the coastal zone of the Southern Skagerrak Coast. It is
   suggested that this effect probably operates through the Norwegian
   Coastal Current (NCC) and is a proxy measure for advective processes.

Title = {{Modelling the effects of an oil spill on open populations of intertidal
   invertebrates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1. Knowledge of the impact of oil spills on coastal communities, in
   California and elsewhere, is currently limited by a lack of long-term
   data, the inability to infer causality from monitoring studies, and the
   necessarily limited spatial and temporal scales of experimental studies.
   2. This study therefore used a modelling approach to investigate the
   combined effects of different intensities of an oil spill and
   recruitment variation on a barnacle Chthamalus fissus population. The
   methodology and results are likely to apply to any similarly open marine
   populations with dispersive larval forms.
   3. The model consisted of a source population comprising individuals
   that reproduced based on size and probability of mortality. Larvae from
   the source population entered a larval pool. A proportion of the larvae
   from the larval pool recruited to a focal population within the region.
   4. The model was used to assess the effects on recruitment to the focal
   population of (i) the size structure of the source population, (ii) the
   intensity of oil spills in the source population, and (iii) recruitment
   intensity to the focal population.
   5. Differences in the size structure of the source population had little
   effect on the reproductive output of the population relative to the
   intensity of the oil spill. Similarly, the intensity of the oil spill
   had a stronger influence on recruitment to the focal population than the
   size structure of the source population. Size structure of the source
   population was important, however, when evaluating the seasonal
   trajectory of the focal population.
   6. Modelling provides a format in which questions about the effects of
   human impacts can be addressed that would be intractable using
   experiments. The results of this model suggest that recruitment
   variation, along with the processes underlying recruitment variation,
   are critical to predicting the effects of disturbance on open marine
   populations.}},

Title = {{A test of methods for estimating population size of the invasive land
   snail Achatina fulica in dense vegetation}},

Abstract = {{1. Physical inaccessibility often complicates censuses of poorly mobile
   organisms. We therefore assessed the effectiveness of using a sample of
   quadrat counts to generate a population estimate corrected for
   inaccessible areas. The result is directly applicable to management of
   the introduced snail Achatina fulica on Ile aux Aigrettes, a small
   island off Mauritius, but also has implications for counting this and
   similar species elsewhere. Accurate counting of A. fulica is important
   given that this species is such a widespread and serious pest.
   2. Counts were made in 17 quadrats taken from a grid covering the
   island. These were used to produce one population estimate by
   interpolating for the rest of the grid using GIS software (method 1). A
   second estimate assumed equal density of snails in accessible and
   inaccessible parts of the 17 quadrats, again with the population
   estimate interpolated (method 2).
   3. Four further quadrats were cleared of vegetation and, by comparison
   of counts before and after clearance, the relationship between initial
   count and true snail number was estimated. This resulted in two further
   population estimates, with the relationship used to adjust counts in the
   17 experimental quadrats before interpolation (methods 3 and 4).
   4. All four estimates were tested using 35 additional quadrats of two
   types. Type 1 quadrats were physically cleared of vegetation; type 2
   quadrats were fully accessible without clearance. Predicted counts in
   these quadrats were assessed for accuracy by comparison with actual
   counts.
   5. The method 1 estimate was clearly inadequate; method 4 gave a
   consistent overestimate; method 2 gave the smallest error in both
   quadrat types. In type 1 quadrats, method 2 and 3 estimates were not
   significantly different and method 2 had a slight tendency to
   underestimate. Overall, for studies of A. fulica , method 2 is
   recommended. However, it should be noted that the study took place
   towards the end of the wet season. In the dry season, damp refuges under
   inaccessible vegetation may be more important and methods 3 and 4 may
   then give a better estimate.
   6. The population of A. fulica with shell length > 10 mm on Ile aux
   Aigrettes near the end of the wet season in 2000 was between 37 300 and
   45 100, with 39 700 being the best estimate.
   7. The results underline the importance of considering inaccessible
   areas when accurate counts of species are needed, and a method is
   suggested by which a simple census technique can be adjusted. In the
   case of A. fulica , more accurate estimates of population size and
   distribution are invaluable in the management, monitoring and
   eradication of this invasive species.}},

Title = {{Linking agricultural practice to insect and bird populations: a
   historical study over three decades}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{673-687}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. There is continuing debate about the impact of agricultural practices
   on farmland wildlife. In particular, it has been postulated that a
   general decline in insect abundance linked with intensification of
   agriculture may have contributed to farmland bird decline. While some
   autecological studies have supported this hypothesis, larger-scale and
   long-term studies are needed.
   2. Suction traps mounted on 12.2-m towers (Rothamsted-type) have been
   sampling aerial insects for nearly 40 years throughout the UK. Their
   catches are correlated over large spatial scales. We analysed insect
   catch data from a single suction trap run for 27 years in a rural
   location in Scotland, and showed that insect numbers have changed
   significantly over time, although non-linearly. The multivariate data
   set (numbers from the 12 common arthropod groups) was summarized using
   principal components analysis (PCA) to extract three components
   explaining 62\% of the variation.
   3. We also used PCA to describe agricultural change, using published
   agricultural data for eight measures of farming in Scotland. Arthropod
   abundance and principal component (PC) scores were significantly related
   to the agricultural PC scores as well to summary climatic measures.
   4. Using Scottish data from the British Trust for Ornithology Common
   Birds Census, we extracted three PC to describe the time-dependent
   average densities of 15 common farmland birds in Scotland. Measures of
   bird density were significantly related to insect abundance and PC
   scores and, independently, to measures of agriculture and climate.
   5. These data from a broad suite of species provide support for linked
   temporal change between farmland birds, invertebrate numbers and
   agricultural practice in Scotland. Although entirely correlative, the
   results are consistent with the view that agricultural change has
   influenced birds through changes in food quality or quantity. The work
   also shows how large-scale invertebrate sampling, in this case using
   suction traps, is useful for monitoring farmland biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The description of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida
   as the causative agent of fish lesions and deaths along the mid-Atlantic
   estuaries has revealed the need for bioassays to assess its potential
   toxigenicity. We designed a bioassay in which fish are exposed to clonal
   dinoflagellate strains or environmental consortia (e.g. environmental
   water or sediment samples) in 750-mL culture flasks, and examined the
   relationships among dinoflagellate proliferation profiles, the presence
   of P. piscicida and fish deaths. Assay development and characterization
   were accomplished with dinoflagellate clonal cultures ( P. piscicida,
   Karlodinium micrum, Prorocentrum minimum, CCMP1828, CCMP1829, and
   CCMP1834) co-incubated with sets of two young adult sheepshead minnows
   (Cyprinodon variegatus). Variables characterized included water quality
   (pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite concentrations), the
   effect of the presence of fish on the proliferation and compositions of
   protist (dinoflagellate, protozoa, diatom) and bacterial populations,
   and time of fish death. The presence of fish in experimental flasks
   induced proliferation of P. piscicida and Cryptoperidiniopsis sp. (but
   not K. micrum or P. minimum) with populations rising between days 6 and
   10, and declining 4 to 5 days later. Some fish deaths occurred when or
   soon after P. piscicida cell numbers were maximal. We conclude that this
   assay enables the assessment of acute effects of ichthyocidal
   dinoflagellates on fish during the first 10 days (Stage A) of the
   experimental course. Fish deaths during the subsequent 10 to 20 days (
   Stage B) may be attributed to the proliferation of ichthyocidal
   dinoflagellates, pathogenic bacteria and/or deteriorating water quality,
   whereas those beyond a period of approximately three weeks ( Stage C)
   can be most certainly attributed to deteriorated water quality.
   Application of the flask assay to environmental samples {[}n=53] yielded
   fish deaths in all three stages: A, 78\%; B, 11\%, and C, 2\%, with fish
   still living in 9\% of the sample waters tested at the conclusion of the
   experiment beyond three weeks. The majority of samples that resulted in
   fish death in stage A tested positive for P. piscicida by PCR. If
   implemented with cautious interpretation, this assay should prove useful
   in monitoring blooms for the presence of P. piscicida and other
   dinoflagellate species potentially harmful to fish.}},

Abstract = {{The sap beetle, Colopterus truncatus (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), is one
   of the primary vectors of the oak wilt pathogen, Ceratocystis
   fagacearum, in the north-central United States. Field behavioral assays
   utilizing various release rates and blends of three methyl-branched
   hydrocarbon aggregation pheromone components showed that flight
   responses of this beetle were similar in Illinois and Minnesota
   populations. In both locations, both sexes of the beetle responded
   synergistically to a combination of the three-component pheromone and
   fermenting whole-wheat bread dough. Further, Colopterus truncatus
   preferred a high release rate over a low release rate of the
   three-component blend. In both locations, the response of C. truncatus
   to a simplified version of the pheromone consisting of
   (2E,4E,6E)-3,5-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatriene (1) and
   (2E,4E,6E,8E)-3,5,7-trimethyl-2,4,6,8-decatetraene (3) was not
   significantly different from the response to the three-component blend.
   An experiment in Illinois with all possible combinations of the
   components demonstrated that the decatetraene (3) was the crucial
   component in the blend; of all treatments, the maximal response was
   elicited by 3 + dough. Chipped bark, phloem, and xylem from northern pin
   oak, Quercus ellipsoidalis, was not attractive to C. truncatus in
   Minnesota. During a weekly survey over two seasons in Minnesota, C.
   truncatus flew in response to the three-component pheromone between
   early April and early July, with the maximum responses coming on May 4,
   2000 and April 20, 2001. During both years, more than 98\% of the
   beetles were trapped between April 14 and June 1. During the same
   survey, Glischrochilus spp. (Nitidulidae) flew during longer periods of
   the summer, particularly in 2001. The sex ratio of C. truncatus
   responding during all experiments was female-biased (1.8:1,
   female-male), which is characteristic of other male-produced coleopteran
   aggregation pheromones. Other sap beetles that play a minor role in the
   pathobiology of C. fagacearum also responded in experiments conducted in
   Minnesota. Carpophilus brachypterus Say was cross-attracted to the two-
   and three-component blends of the C. truncatus pheromone and dough,
   whereas two Glischrochilus spp. were attracted to all treatments that
   contained dough.}},

Title = {{Demographic consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding in Arnica

Abstract = {{1 The genetic constitution of populations may significantly affect
   demography. Founder populations or isolated remnants may show inbreeding
   depression, while established populations can be strongly adapted to the
   local environment. Gene exchange between populations can lead to better
   performance if heterozygosity levels are restored (heterosis), or to
   reduced performance if coadapted gene complexes are disrupted
   (outbreeding depression).
   2 Five populations of the self-incompatible perennial Arnica montana
   (Asteraceae) were analysed for the demographic consequences of
   inbreeding and of intra- and interpopulation outcrossing, using both
   small and large populations as donors for the latter. We analysed seed
   production and seed weight and monitored growth, survival and flowering
   of offspring introduced as seeds and as 4-week-old seedlings in a 4-year
   field experiment.
   3 Reduced seed set after selfing was probably due to the
   self-incompatibility system rather than to inbreeding depression. There
   was a significant increase for seed set after interpopulation crosses,
   which resulted from the alleviation of low mate availability in one of
   the small populations.
   4 Significant inbreeding depression was observed for growth rates of
   plants introduced as seedlings. We found significant heterosis for
   flowering probability of plants introduced as seeds, but for plants
   introduced as seedlings, heterosis for seedling size and flowering
   probability was only marginally significant. Outbreeding depression was
   not observed.
   5 The results of this study are important for reinforcement measures in
   small, remnant populations. Significant differences among populations
   for all measured fitness components suggest that reinforcement is best
   achieved using material from several populations.
   6 The observed higher survival of seedlings as compared with seeds
   suggests that it is better to plant individuals than to sow. Sowing,
   however, is easier and cheaper, and was more likely to eliminate poorly
   adapted genotypes before they contribute to the next generation.}},

Abstract = {{1 Cypselas (fruits) of Scotch thistle (Onopordum acanthium ) germinate
   unpredictably over a long period of time. We evaluated the effects of
   soil type, burial depth and collection date on the emergence patterns of
   two populations of O. acanthium , ESW and Quarry (Q).
   2 From each of four separate collections made throughout 1996, five
   replicates of 200 cypselas each were placed on the surface or buried at
   depths of 3 or 15 cm in both sand and silt-loam soils (i.e. field
   conditions) and emergence was recorded biweekly between August 1996 and
   September 1999.
   3 Emergence was intermittent over the 3 years, with a higher total
   percentage from silt loam (17\%) than from sand (9\%), and from 3 cm
   depth (18\%) compared with the surface (8\%).
   4 After 3 years, all remaining viable, split (germinated but not
   emerged), decayed and unfilled cypselas were retrieved. Total
   germination over the 3 years (emerged plus split) was up to 77\% at 3 cm
   in silt loam but always less than 10\% at 15 cm in both soils for both
   populations. Although a higher percentage of cypselas germinated under
   controlled conditions when retrieved from loam compared with sand (89\%
   vs. 66\%), a significant number from all treatments did not germinate
   until scarified.
   5 Cypselas that ripened under the warmest temperature (collection 3) had
   the highest emergence in the year of collection (1996), while more of
   those that ripened under cooler temperatures (collections 1 and 4)
   emerged in later years (1998 and 1999). Both initial and later emergence
   patterns for both populations varied greatly with collection date. This
   may be the first time that seedling emergence from the seed bank for
   different collections has been monitored over several years.
   6 We compared waxes, lignins and soluble phenolics in the coats of
   cypselas retrieved from soil (early germinators) with those that
   germinated only after scarification. More surface wax was found in
   dormant cypselas.
   7 Understanding these complex germination/emergence patterns may help
   develop control policies for O. acanthium .}},

Abstract = {{Methods are described for the in vivo production of the nematode
   Thripinema nicklewoodi (Siddiqi), an obligate parasite and potential
   biological control agent of western flower thrips Frankliniella
   occidentalis (Pergande), Nematode infection is not lethal but causes
   sterilization of adult female hosts. Both fertilization and horizontal
   transmission of T nicklewoodi is achieved in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge
   tubes (infection arenas) in the presence of 100\% humidity a temporary
   food source and preferably a damp substrate. Following exposure to
   infection arenas, F occidentalis are reared on excised bean leaves
   Phaseolus vulgaris (L.) in polypropylene containers for 2 wk at
   25degreesC to allow the reproduction and development of a single
   generation of nematodes within infected hosts's abdominal cavity. To
   identify infected hosts after this incubation period. Thrips are
   isolated in microcentrifuge tubes and monitored for free-living
   nematodes being released along with frass. Infected thrips are
   reintroduced back into infection arenas to inoculate further thrips to
   maintain the culture. We documented the output of the rearing procedure
   using a standard method and following simple manipulation of several
   individual parameters of the infection technique, The standard method
   was the most efficient and resulted in an increased (output/input) ratio
   of infected thrips of approximate to2; i.e., the number of infected
   thrips approximately doubles each generation. Monitoring infected thrips
   revealed that nematodes were first released between 12-14 d
   postinfection and for an average of 7.9 d at 25degreesC highlighting the
   potential to reuse infective thrips between infection arenas. The
   possibility of using T nicklewoodi as an inoculative agent against F
   occidentalis infesting floricultural crops is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivities of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) field populations to
   Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal protein Cry1Ac were monitored
   during 1998-2000 in China. A total of 41 strains was sampled, and most
   of them were collected from Bt cotton planting regions. The range of
   IC50 values (concentration producing 50\% inhibition of larval
   development to third instar) among different populations in 1998, 1999,
   and 2000 were 0.020-0.105 mug/ml. 0.016-0.099 mug/ml, and 0.016-0.080
   mug/ml, respectively. Diagnostic concentration studies (IC99) showed
   that the percentage of individuals reaching third instar ranged from 0
   to 4.35\% with only eight of the 41 tested populations showing values
   above 0\%. Also interesting was a trend over successive years in which
   fewer populations contained individuals that survived the diagnostic
   concentration by reaching third instar. Considering these data, it was
   determined that the field populations sampled during the 3-yr study were
   susceptible to Cry1Ac protein and that movement toward resistance among
   H. armigera populations was not apparent.}},

Abstract = {{In a search for a pyrethroid resistance diagnostic marker, a partial
   sequence of the para-like sodium channel gene was obtained from 78
   diploid females of the arrhenotokous insect pest species Frankliniella
   occidentalis (Pergande), the western flower thrips. Although all the
   insects analyzed came from a single laboratory population. nine
   different haplotypes were obtained. Two haplotypes did have the
   well-known L to F kdr mutation. but only one of these could be
   statistically linked to pyrethroid resistance in our population. This
   haplotype did not have the superkdr mutation but did have a unique
   mutation a few amino acids downstream. at a position already linked to
   resistance in Plutella. Although this para-like locus seemed to have a
   role in pyrethroid resistance in our population, other resistance
   mechanisms were also probably involved. The fact that our laboratory
   population open to migration, contained a high genetic diversity for
   this selected gene shows that ``pest tourism{''} is a major factor for
   resistance dynamics in this greenhouse pest. This, with the possible
   occurrence of an original resistance mutation might preclude the use of
   very specific approaches for resistance monitoring, in the field in this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Beat sampling and two type of traps. cup traps and Tedders traps. were
   evaluated as sampling methods to detect arid estimate population
   densities of adult Diaprepes abbreviatus L. weevils newly colonizing
   young citrus trees. The studs m, Lis conducted over a 65-wk period
   across a 0.25-ha area of 80 citrus trees {[}Citrus sinensis (L.),
   Osbeck] (1.2-1.5 m tall), Beat samples were taken weekly to determine
   the number of trees infested and number of new adult weevils per true,
   Sixteen of the 80 trees studied were each monitored weekly using one of
   the Following trapping methods: cup traps in trees, cup traps on a stake
   in the ground within the tree drip line, cup traps on a stake in the
   ground outside of the drip line. Tedders traps on the ground within the
   drip line and Tedders traps on the ground outside of the drip line.
   Weevils collected each week from trees and traps were removed from the
   study site, Based on the coefficients associated with Taylor's power
   law, the optimum numbers of trees to sample for an SEM equal to 25\% of
   the mean estimate decreased from 50 trees at a mean of 0.5 new weevils
   per tree to 30 trees at a mean of 0.8 new weevils per tree. A
   significant relationship was found between the weekly mean number of new
   weevils per tree and the proportion of trees infested, a binomial
   relationship that could be further explored in the search for a sampling
   program for adult D, abbreviatus. Regression analyses indicated that
   three of the trapping methods served at least as weak indices of the
   presence and abundance of new weevils: cup traps in trees. Tedders traps
   inside the dripline and Tedders traps outside the dripline, Cup traps in
   trees and Tedders traps inside the dripline captured the most weevils
   and most frequently detected weevils. Although relatively inefficient is
   abundance indices of populations of new weevils, these two trapping
   methods appeared to have some value with respect to signaling when
   weevils first appeared in trees during the spring.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature, drying, and rewetting are important climatic factors that
   control microbial properties. In the present study we looked at the
   respiration rates, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) content, and
   adenylate energy charge, (AEC) as a measure for energy status of
   microbial biomass in the upper 5 cm of mineral soils of three beech
   forests at different temperatures and after rewetting. The soils
   differed widely in pH (4.0 to 6.0), microbial biomass C (92 to 916 mug
   (g DW)(-1)) and ATP content (2.17 to 7.29 nmol ATP (g DW)(-1)). The
   soils were incubated for. three weeks at 7 degreesC, 14 degreesC, and 21
   degreesC. After three weeks the microbial properties were determined,
   retaining temperature conditions. The temperature treatment acid not
   significantly affect AEC or ATP content, but respiration rates increased
   significantly with increasing temperature. In a second experiment the
   soils were dried for 12 hours at 40 degreesC. Afterwards the soils were
   rewetted and microbial properties were monitored for 72 hours. After the
   drying, respiration rates dropped below the detection limit; but within
   one hour after rewetting respiration rates increased above control level
   drying reduced AEC by 16 \% to 44 \% and ATP content by 47 \% to 7.8 \%,
   respectively. Rewetting increased AEC and ATP content significantly as
   compared to dry soil, but after 72 hours the level of the controls was
   still not reached. The level of AEC values indicated dormant cells, but
   ATP content increased. These results indicate that he microbial carbon
   turnover was not directly linked to microbial growth or microbial
   energy, status. Furthermore our results indicate that AEC may describe
   an average energy status but does not reflect phases of growing,
   dormant, or dying cells in the complex microbial populations of soils.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the impact of natural levels of UVBR
   (ultraviolet-B radiation: 280 to 315 nm) on bacterio- and phytoplankton
   (<10 \&mu;m) from the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea. Incident biologically
   effective doses (BEDs) and attenuation of biologically effective
   radiation in the water column were measured using a DNA biodosimeter.
   UVBR-induced DNA damage was measured as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers
   (CPDs), using an antibody directed to CPDs followed by chemiluminescent
   detection. Depth profiles of DNA damage were determined in two plankton
   size fractions (0.2 to 0.8 \&mu;m and 0.8 to 10 \&mu;m) collected down
   to 50 m depth. Furthermore) accumulation and removal of CPDs were
   monitored in surface plankton samples during several daily cycles. Small
   plankton (plankton < 10 mum) composition was determined by flow
   cytometry. The plankton community in the Gulf of Aqaba was dominated by
   nonphototrophic bacteria and the free-living prochlorophyte
   Prochlorococcus spp. (<0.8 \&mu;m). In general, no DNA damage could be
   detected in dosimeter DNA below 15 m. In contrast, DNA damage (up to 124
   CPD Mnucl(-1)) could be detected in all bacterio- and phytoplankton
   samples. DNA damage accumulated throughout the day, indicating that
   plankton in the Gulf of Aqaba undergo UVBR stress via CPD induction.
   Although the numbers of CPDs decreased during darkness, both size
   fractions showed some residual DNA damage at the end of the night. This
   suggests that dark repair processes did not remove all CPDs, or that
   part of the plankton community was incapable of repair at all. CPD
   levels in the two size fractions showed no significant differences in
   situ. During full solar radiation exposures (samples incubated in bags),
   more CPDs were detected in the smaller (0.2 to 0.8 \&mu;m) size fraction
   as compared to the larger (0.8 to 10 \&mu;m) size fraction. In these
   experiments, initial plankton composition was significantly different
   from the field samples. This implies that a shift in the population
   structure or irradiance conditions can lead to a significant change in
   UVBR sensitivity. In conclusion, the results show that the
   picoplankton-dominated phyto- and bacterioplankton communities in the
   clear surface waters from the Gulf of Aqaba undergo UVBR stress. Repair
   pathways are not sufficient to eliminate damage during or after UVBR
   exposure hours, suggesting photomortality as a potential loss parameter
   of the plankton community.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal changes at 16 allozyme loci in the Diplodus sargus population
   of Banyuls-sur-Mer (Mediterranean Sea, France) were monitored. Temporal
   genetic variation within a single population was examined over two
   temporal scales: (i) among three year-classes sampled at the same age,
   and (ii) within a single year-class sampled three times over a two-year
   period. We observed a significant change in the genotypic structure
   within the same cohort during the first two years following settlement
   and before recruitment into the adult population. In addition,
   comparison of year-classes showed that cohorts differed significantly
   one year after settlement, whereas they became similar later on before
   recruitment into the adult population. The observed changes in the
   genetic structure within and between year-classes may be the result of
   complex selective processes or genetic drift. Linkage disequilibrium and
   genetic relatedness data suggest that these changes are due to large
   variation in reproductive success, followed by homogenization through
   adult movement. Overall, these results demonstrated a rapid genetic
   change within a population.}},

Abstract = {{Because populations of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus have been
   difficult to sample in small impoundments. we determined whether tandem
   hoop net series (three nets tied in series and baited with cheese)
   fished for 3 d could effectively sample these populations, In 2000 we
   compared seasonal catch rates (catch per unit effort {[}CPUE], defined
   as the number of fish caught per series) and length frequencies (total
   length {[}TL]: mm) of channel catfish captured with two types of tandem
   series (long versus short bridles) and monitored the mortality of
   channel catfish along with the CPUE and mortality of bycatch in five
   lakes, Mean CPUE ranged from 12 to 194 fish/series for channel catfish
   and front 5 to 101 fish/series for bycatch among series types. takes,
   and sampling periods. Mean CPUE for channel catfish and bycatch was
   similar between series types and did not consistently vary with sampling
   period. Length frequencies of channel catfish were usually similar
   between series types. Mortality was low for both channel catfish (0.3\%
   of total catch) and bycatch (8\%). In 2001, using short-bridled series,
   we assessed gear size bias in one lake; sampled 66 lakes that are
   stocked annually with channel catfish fingerlings at rates of 12, 37, or
   74/ha and estimated the sample sizes required for precise estimates of
   mean CPUE and accurate estimates of size structure. Hoop nets failed to
   capture channel catfish less than 250 mm TL in proportion to their
   abundance, Mean CPUE among 02 lakes ranged from 0,5 to 369,7 channel
   catfish/series and increased with stocking rate. Four lakes were
   excluded because of the high catch and mortality of turtles. Mean TL
   ranged from 276 to 403 turn among the lakes and decreased with stocking
   rate. For moderate precision (coefficient of variation {[}100-SE/mean] =
   0.2) of mean CPUE, from 12 to nearly 50 series were required. and length
   measurements from 300 fish were necessary for accurate assessments of
   size structure, Tandem hoop netting provided adequate samples of channel
   catfish in most small impoundments, hut obtaining precise estimates of
   CPUE may be difficult; moreover, turtle mortality can lie problematic in
   some lakes.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impacts of fertilization and grazing by
   Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus), grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys
   rufocanus), and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) on a diverse tundra plant
   community dominated by deciduous shrubs. Four out of eight study areas,
   having a size of 2500 m(2) each, were fertilized with a N-P-K fertilizer
   and four areas served as unfertilized controls. Two types of exclosures
   were used within each study area, one to exclude solely reindeer, and
   one to exclude both rodents and reindeer.,Open, grazed plots served as
   controls. During 5 years following the fertilization event the changes
   in vegetation inside and outside the exclosures were monitored using a
   point frequency method. The densities of rodents on the fertilized and
   unfertilized areas were investigated by live trapping and by counting
   nests of overwintering individuals. Reindeer do not graze on the study
   area during the growing season but migrate through this area in autumn
   and spring. Fertilization increased the abundance of vascular plants
   while grazing by reindeer and rodents decreased the abundance of
   vascular plants significantly on both fertilized and unfertilized areas.
   Rodents preferred clearly the fertilized areas during winter, decreasing
   the abundance of Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea, while
   very little grazing occurred during summer. Graminoids showed the
   strongest positive response to fertilization and dominated the plant
   community on ungrazed plots, while winter grazing by both reindeer and
   rodents significantly decreased the abundance of graminoids. Deciduous
   shrubs (Betula nana, Vaccinitan myrtillus) increased slightly but
   significantly due to fertilization and evergreen dwarf shrubs showed no
   response to fertilization. However, the use of functional growth forms
   for predicting the responses of nutrient enrichment and grazing must be
   questioned, as responses to fertilization as well as preferences by
   herbivores were shown to be species-specific rather than uniform within
   functional groups based on plant growth forms.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals, free to choose between different habitat patches, should
   settle among them such that fitness is equalized. Alternatives to this
   ideal free distribution result into fitness differences among the
   patches. The concordance between fitnesses and foraging costs among
   inhabitants of different quality patches, demonstrated in recent
   studies, suggests that the mode of habitat selection and the resulting
   fitness patterns may have important implications to the resource use of
   a forager and to the survival of its prey. We studied how coarse scale
   selection between habitat patches of different quality and quitting
   harvest rate in these patches are related to each other and to fine
   scale patch use in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). To
   demonstrate these relationships, we manipulated habitat patches within
   large field enclosures by mowing vegetative cover and adding
   supplemental food according to a 2 x 2 factorial design. We tracked vole
   population densities, collected giving-up densities (GUDs, a measure of
   patch quitting harvest rate), and monitored the removal of seeds from
   lattice grids with 1.5 m intervals (an index of fine-scale space use) in
   the manipulated habitat patches. Changes in habitat quality induced
   changes in habitat use at different spatial scales. In preferred
   habitats with intact cover, voles were despotic and GUDs were low, but
   increased with the addition of food. In contrast, voles in
   less-preferred mowed habitats settled into an ideal free distribution,
   GUDs were high and uninfluenced by the addition of food. Seed removal
   was enhanced by the presence of cover but inhibited by supplemental
   food. Across all treatments, vole densities and GUDs were strongly
   correlated making it impossible to separate their effects on seed
   removal rates. However, this relationship broke down in unmowed
   habitats, where GUDs rather than vole density primarily influenced seed
   removal by voles. GUDs and seed removal correlated with predation on
   tree seedlings formerly planted into the enclosures, demonstrating the
   mechanisms between coarse-scale habitat manipulations and community
   level consequences on a forager's prey.}},

Abstract = {{A range of insecticides was applied at recommended application rates
   against populations of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) carrying various
   combinations of three insecticide resistance mechanisms
   (carboxylesterase-based metabolic resistance and two target-site
   mechanisms, known as MACE and kdr), supported on either Chinese cabbage
   or potatoes in field simulator cages. Patterns of response were similar
   on both host species. MACE conferred extreme resistance to pirimicarb
   and triazamate (dimethylcarbamate insecticides). The kdr mechanism was
   associated with resistance to lambdacyhalothrin, cypermethrin and
   deltamethrin (pyrethroid insecticides). A mixture of pirimicarb plus
   lambda-cyhalothrin was only effective against M persicae not carrying
   kdr or carrying kdr and low carboxylesterase-based resistance. None of
   the insecticides tested was effective against M persicae carrying both
   MACE and kdr resistance. The implications of these findings for the
   formulation of control strategies, based on regular monitoring of
   resistance genotype frequencies, are discussed.

Abstract = {{The evolution of the plant single-stranded DNA virus Tomato, yellow leaf
   curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) (genus Begomovirus. family Geminiviridae)
   has been monitored for 8 years after its appearance in southern Spain.
   Variation within three genomic regions of 166 TYLCSV isolates collected
   from three locations was assessed by single-strand conformation
   polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. According to SSCP, the intergenic region
   (IR) was the most variable. Low genetic diversity was found within the
   population and geographical or temporal differences were not evident.
   Nucleotide sequences of specific genomic regions of haplotypes
   identified by SSCP indicated close relationships among them. Therefore.
   the Spanish TYLCSV population appears to represent a single.
   undifferentiated population. The analysis of IR sequences for a
   subsample of 76 randomly chosen isolates, confirmed the limited genetic
   diversity revealed by the SSCP analysis. A tendency to a lineal increase
   in diversity over time was observed in Malaga and Almeria subpopulutions
   however, no accumulation of mutations in single isolates was evident.
   Negative selection to variation seems to operate to conserve certain
   regions of the genome. Thus, the low genetic diversity found in the
   studied TYLCSV population might be the result of a founder effect with
   Subsequent selection against less fit variants arising by mutation.}},

Abstract = {{In Atlantic Canada, both Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus occur naturally
   in sympatric populations and readily hybridize forming genotypically
   complex assemblages that vary widely in relative species composition
   throughout the region. We monitored growth in single year-class cohorts
   of rope-cultured Mytilus spp. during a 14-month period from sleeving of
   seed to harvest at three commercial mussel farms in Notre Dame Bay,
   Newfoundland, Canada. Electrophoretic variation at the mannose phosphate
   isomerase (Mpi) enzyme locus was used to categorize the two species (M.
   edulis and M. trossulus ) and their hybrids. Seed populations varied
   significantly among sites in relative proportions of each species and
   hybrids. Growth in shell length, wet weight and shell weight varied
   significantly with Mpi genotype at all three farm sites. Growth in flesh
   weight varied significantly with Mpi genotype at two of the three sites.
   Growth rates for all weight variables were consistently significantly
   greater in M. edulis than in sympatric M. trossulus . Growth in shell
   length was significantly different between sympatric M. edulis and M.
   trossulus at only one farm site. Growth rates of hybrids were typically
   intermediate between sympatric M. edulis and M. trossulus , but were
   often statistically similar to one or other of M. edulis or M. trossulus
   . We conclude that the production of rope-cultured blue mussels in
   Atlantic Canada is significantly influenced by genotype-dependent growth
   variation in naturally occurring mixed-species stocks. Our results also
   suggest that farm site production may be increased and intrasite
   variability reduced at farm sites currently using indigenous
   mixed-species stocks by substitution and growout of transplanted seed
   from unispecific M. edulis stocks.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between bacteria and harmful algae are potentially
   important regulating factors for population dynamics of both organisms
   and for toxin production. These interactions are still poorly
   understood. To monitor the physical associations between potentially
   toxic bacteria and dinoflagellates in controlled conditions, we
   inoculated an axenic non-toxic strain of Alexandrium tamarense
   (Dinophyceae) together with reputed paralytic shellfish toxin
   (PST)-producing bacteria belonging to the genus Alteromonas (gamma
   subdivision of the division Proteobacteria) and to the clade Roseobacter
   (alpha subdivision of the division Proteobacteria). The attachment
   behavior of both bacterial strains was monitored using TSA-FISH
   (tyramide signal amplification and fluorescent in situ hybridization)
   and confocal microscopy. Our results suggest that ageing dinoflagellate
   cultures stimulate both free bacterial growth and attachment. However,
   toxin production by originally non-toxic dinoflagellate cells was not
   induced by the physical interaction of either of the bacterial strains
   with the dinoflagellate cells. This does not support the hypothesis that
   toxic bacteria could simply control toxin production by attachment to
   particle surfaces such as eukaryotic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Ten commercial sugarcane cultivars were planted in 10 replicate plots in
   each of three field trials in southern Queensland, to evaluate their
   response to the sugarcane soldier fly Inopus rubriceps . Trials were
   monitored for three harvests. Numbers of soldier fly larvae differed
   slightly between cultivars, but probably not enough to prevent the
   development of damaging populations. Weights of larvae were the same on
   all cultivars, suggesting that antibiosis was not involved. The effect
   of soldier fly on performance of cultivars in each trial was examined by
   regression of number of ratoon shoots and subsequent number and weight
   of mature stalks and crop yield on larval density during summer-autumn
   within each crop class. Where statistically significant relationships
   were detected in ratoons, each increase in soldier fly density of 100
   m(-2) was associated with a yield reduction of 1.2-6.4 tonnes cane
   ha(-1) , or 3-8\% of the expected yield of uninfested plants. In most
   analyses, the slopes of regressions were the same for all cultivars,
   indicating no differential response to soldier fly infestation among the
   cultivars tested.}},

Abstract = {{Despite extensive research into the coral bleaching phenomena there are
   very few data which examine the population biology of affected species.
   These data are required in order to predict the capacity of corals to
   respond to environmental change. We monitored individual colonies of 4
   common coral species for 8 mo following historically high sea-surface
   temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998 to compare their response
   to, and recovery from, thermal stress and to examine the effect of
   bleaching on growth and reproduction in 2 Acropora species. Platygyra
   daedalea and P. lobata colonies took longer to bleach, longer to recover
   and longer to die. In contrast, Acropora hyacinthus and A. millepora
   colonies bleached quickly and most had either recovered, or died, within
   14 wk of the initial reports of bleaching. Whole colony mortality was
   high in A. hyacinth us (88\%) and A. millepora (32\%) and partial
   mortality rare. In contrast, most colonies of P. daedalea and P. lobata
   lost some tissue and few whole colonies died. The mean proportion of
   tissue lost per colony was 43 6.6\% and 11 +/- 1.1\% respectively.
   Consequently, observed hierarchies of species susceptibility will depend
   critically on the time since the onset of stress and must consider both
   whole and partial colony mortality. Colony mortality was highly
   dependent on visual estimates of the severity of bleaching but
   independent of size. Growth rates of Acropora colonies were highly
   variable and largely independent of the severity of bleaching. A.
   hyacinthus was more susceptible to bleaching than A. millepora with 45\%
   of surviving colonies gravid compared to 88\%. High whole-colony
   mortality combined with a reduction in the reproductive output of
   surviving Acropora suggests that recovery to former levels of abundance
   is likely to be slow.}},

Abstract = {{At Lough Hyne Marine Nature Reserve, several species of sponge are
   commonly found unattached to any hard substratum and appear to persist
   over time with this unusual life style. Two species, Hymeniacidon
   perlevis (Montagu) and Suberites fiats (L.) were monitored over a 1-year
   period. Wet weights and buoyant masses were taken from 30 unattached
   specimens (experimental sponges) of both species at 3-month intervals.
   Thirty unattached (control sponges) and 30 attached specimens were
   observed in situ and served as controls for mortality investigations.
   Most unattached specimens were limited in distribution to between 1 and
   6 m around the edges of the Lough. Their distributions were much more
   restricted and densities were lower in March 2000 than in March 1999
   (between March 1999 and September 1999 the numbers of control,
   experimental and attached sponges did not decline). Between September
   1999 and March 2000 the number of specimens of both species of
   unattached sponge declined dramatically (both experimental and control
   sponges), although a similar decrease was not observed in attached
   sponges over the same time period. Also between March 1999 and September
   1999 unattached sponge populations grew. but populations of remaining
   sponges decreased in size between September 1999 and March 2000.
   Differences occurred in tissue densities of the unattached H. perlevis
   in winter and summer months, but not with S. ficus. The origins of the
   two unattached sponge species differed. Most specimens of H. perlevis
   originated from overgrowing shells or boulders and most S. ficus arose
   from detachment from cliff surfaces or large boulders.}},

Abstract = {{Wood is one of our most important natural resources and has been
   exploited for many hundreds of years as fuel, building material and a
   source of paper. Its composition is variable among and within species.
   The ability to monitor the intra-specific variability is a prerequisite
   to improve wood and end-products properties. This paper describes a
   study of the genetic control of a large set of wood properties,
   including growth, timber quality traits, wood chemical composition,
   kraft pulp production parameters and pulp properties, in a 12 x 12 half
   diallel of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.). While relatively high
   (h(ns)(2) > 0.3) narrow-sense heritabilities were observed for density
   heterogeneity, lignin content, alpha-cellulose content and coarseness,
   no significant genetic effect was detected for hemi cellulose, water
   extractives, kraft pulp production parameters and pylodin. Slightly
   lower heritabilities (0.15 < h(ns)(2) < 0.3) were also obtained for wood
   density and fibre properties (length, width, curl, zero span). As a
   consequence and considering the phenotypic coefficient of variation
   obtained for these traits, improvement by selection of trees with
   outstanding wood quality is feasible. Nevertheless, it seems obvious
   that wood quality breeding can not be done without taking into account
   growth, and the only way to manage this constraint (negative correlation
   between growth and density) will be the constitution of elite ``wood
   quality{''} populations in a already growth improved genetic population.}},

Abstract = {{Outdoor, indoor and personal PM2.5 measurements were made in a
   population of nonsmoking adults from three communities in the
   Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area between April and November 1999.
   Thirty-two healthy adult subjects (23 females, 9 males; mean age 42 +/-
   10, range: 24-64 yr) were monitored for 2-15 days during the spring,
   summer, and fall monitoring seasons. Twenty-four hour average
   gravimetric PM2.5 samples were collected using a federal reference
   monitor (Anderson RAAS2.5-300) located at outdoor (O) central sites in
   the Battle Creek (BCK), East St. Paul (ESP) and Phillips (PHI)
   communities. Concurrent 24-h average indoor (1) and personal (P), and a
   limited number of outdoor-at-home (O@H) samples were collected using
   inertial impactors (PEM(TM) Model 200, MSP, Inc). The O (geometric mean
   \{GM\} = 8.6; n = 271; range: 1.0-41 mug/m(3)) were lower than I
   concentrations (GM = 10.7; n = 294; range 1.3-131 mug/m(3)), which were
   lower than P concentrations (GM =19.0; n = 332; range 2.2-298 mug/m(3)).
   Correlation coefficients between O concentrations in the three
   communities were high and measured GM O levels in BCK were significantly
   lower than ESP, most likely because of local sources, but GM
   concentrations in PHI were not significantly different from BCK or ESP.
   On days with paired samples (n = 29), O concentrations were
   significantly lower (mean difference 2.9 mug/m(3); p = 0.026) than O@H
   measurements (GM =11.3; range: 3.5-33.8 mug/m(3)), likely due to local
   sources in communities. Observed I and P concentrations were more
   variable, probably because of residential central air conditioning and
   hours of household ventilation for I and P, and occupational and
   environmental tobacco smoke exposures outside the residence for P.
   Across all individuals and days the median PM2.5 ``personal cloud{''}
   was 5.7mug/m(3), but the mean of the average for each participant was
   15.7 mug/m(3), with very low values in participants who did not work
   outside the home and much higher values in subjects with active
   lifestyles. Across all households and individuals the correlation
   between P and O concentrations was not significant, but the overall I-O
   correlation (0.27) and P-I correlation (0.51) were significant (p<0.05).
   Relatively little spatial variability was observed in O PM2.5
   concentrations across the three communities compared to the variability
   associated with I and P samples, and the measured O levels were
   relatively low compared to other large metropolitan areas in the United
   States. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sea-breeze circulation influences ozone concentration differently for
   two types of synoptic winds across the westcentral coastal plain of
   Taiwan. During summer months, when the synoptic flow is southerly, a
   strong westerly sea-breeze confined to the lower 700-800 m, produces a
   northeastward flow. Ozone concentration is low, with a core centered at
   about 100 m, leading to moderate ozone concentrations in the low
   population density northeastern foothills. In autumn (and spring),
   northerly synoptic winds of about the same strength combine with less
   energetic westerly sea breeze to produce a southeastward flow that
   carries higher ozone levels into the heavily populated Taichung basin.
   Ozone levels are high from 80 to 400 m, with a core up to 120 ppb from
   about 150 to 300 m, contributing to serious ozone episodes at the
   southern (downwind) end of the basin. Analyzing the backward
   trajectories and ozone concentration showed that the weak southeastward
   breeze is the dominant factor affecting the occurrence of high ozone
   events in the region.
   The horizontal distribution is based on 3 yr data obtained from a
   network of air-pollution monitoring sites in the study area, while the
   vertical data comes from two 2-day tethersonde experiments, measuring
   wind-speed, direction, temperature and humidity, NO, NO2, NMHC and O-3,
   conducted during August and November 1999. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Spread of air pollution sources and non-uniform mixing conditions in
   urban or regional air sheds often result in spatial variation of
   pollutant concentrations over different parts of the air sheds. A
   comprehensive understanding of this variation of concentrations is
   imperative for informed planning, monitoring and assessment in a range
   of critical areas including assessment of monitoring network efficiency
   or assessment of population exposure variation as a function of the
   location in the city. The aims of this work were to study the citywide
   variability of pollutants as measured by ``urban background{''} type
   monitoring stations and to interpret the results in relation to the
   applicability of the data to population exposure assessments and the
   network efficiency. A comparison between ambient concentrations of NOx,
   ozone and PM10 was made for three stations in the Brisbane air shed
   network. The best correlated between the three stations were ozone
   concentrations followed by NO, concentration, with the worst
   correlations observed for PM10. With a few exceptions correlations of
   all pollutants between the stations were statistically significant.
   Marginally better were the correlations for the lower concentrations of
   pollutants that represent urban background, over the correlations for
   higher concentrations, representing peak values. Implications of these
   findings on application of the monitoring data to air-quality
   management, as well as the need for further investigations has been
   discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used a behavioral bioassay to estimate the advantages that two
   species of gerbils (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum) experienced by
   preferring a semistabilized dune habitat over a stabilized sand habitat.
   We used the magnitude of foraging effort by the gerbils to signal the
   difference between the two habitats. When they were foraging as much in
   stabilized sand as in semistabilized dune, we inferred that these
   habitats were providing equivalent rewards. We performed a series of
   experiments in two 1-ha field enclosures, each containing similar
   proportions of stabilized sand and semistabilized dune. Each enclosure
   contained a population of only one of the species. By varying the amount
   of seeds added (either 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 g of seeds in 18 seed trays) to
   each habitat and monitoring the behavior of the gerbils, we were able to
   fit a curve that reflected the change in habitat preference as a
   function of seed addition rate. We were also able to show how much seed
   addition had to be added to bring the two habitats into equal use. Each
   species required only 13 g/ha/night to entirely offset the advantage of
   the semistabilized dune.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of most avian species associated with grasslands have
   declined in North America over the last few decades. These declines may
   be related, in part, to changes in species composition and management of
   pastures and hayfields. The incorporation of native, warm-season grasses
   into pasture and hayfield management has been suggested as a means of
   providing suitable habitat for birds in agricultural areas. To examine
   this, we compared avian abundance, richness, and reproductive success in
   warm- {[}i.e. switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and big bluestem
   (Andropogon gerardii)] and cool-season grass {[}i.e. orchardgrass
   (Dactylis glomerata)] fields on private farms in southwest Pennsylvania.
   Point counts, nest monitoring, and vegetation sampling were conducted on
   nine pairs (warm- and cool-season grass) of fields in 1996, and 12 pairs
   of fields in 1997. Compared with cool-season grass fields, warm-season
   grass fields supported a greater abundance and richness of birds,
   including several declining species {[}e.g. song sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), chipping sparrows (Spizella
   passerina), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and vesper
   sparrows (Pooccetes gramineus)]. Additionally, due to lower nest
   destruction and depredation rates, birds in warm-season grass fields had
   greater nest success and fledge rates. The positive response of birds to
   the use of warm-season grasses in pastures and hayfields appears to be
   due to the increased availability of undisturbed cover. Thus, the
   establishment of warm-season grasses in pastures and hayfields should be
   an avian conservation and management priority. Convincing farmers to use
   warm-season grasses in their fields should not be difficult, as several
   state and federal programs fund their establishment, and the use of
   these grasses increases forage production and farm income. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Navassa Island is a tiny, (5 km(2)) uninhabited US protectorate located
   between Jamaica and Haiti. It is part of the Caribbean Islands National
   Wildlife Refuge, under the jurisdiction of the US Fish and Wildlife
   Service. We conducted a quantitative assessment of Navassa's coral reef
   fishes and benthic habitat, in order to assist with the development of
   conservation plan for the island. The shallow reefs of Navassa (<23m)
   have high live coral cover (range 20-26.1\%), high degree of
   architectural complexity (rugosity index range 1.4-1.9), and moderate
   abundance of the keystone grazing urchin, Diadenia antillarum, at all
   sites (mean 2.9 +/- 0.9 per 30 m(2)). Despite its remoteness, an
   unregulated, artisanal fishery (primarily using traps and hook and line)
   carried out by Haitians is the primary mode of human impact on Navassa
   reefs. Even so, reef fish communities exhibit high density (range 97-140
   fish per 60 m(2)) and retain representation by large snapper, grouper
   and herbivores, which are mostly lacking in nearby Caribbean locations
   with high fishing pressure. Thus, Navassa reefs appear to be trophically
   intact with fish populations relatively ``unexploited,{''} presenting a
   conservation challenge and a research opportunity. The regulation and
   conservation of the fishery will be difficult, due to the international
   nature of the situation. However, given the apparently small impact that
   artisanal fisheries have yet had on its reef communities, Navassa
   presents a possibly unique opportunity to study the ecological
   functioning of a relatively trophically intact Caribbean reef, and
   represents a strong imperative for conservation, monitoring, and
   research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2002}},

Abstract = {{Scenario studies were carried out with a process-based model for control
   of wild-type and genetically modified baculoviruses in populations of
   Spodoptera exigua in glasshouse chrysanthemum (BACSIM). These scenario
   studies were used to evaluate the effectiveness of different spraying
   regimes, concentrations, UV-protection agents, and mean time to kill
   insects. In simulations on concentration and timing of S. exigua
   multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV), good control efficacy was
   obtained with SeMNPV concentrations of 1 x 10(7) polyhedra/m(2) or
   higher. An early timing of virus applications, soon after egg
   deposition, is essential for effective control, especially at high
   temperatures, when the developmental rate of larvae is high and the
   window of opportunity for virus control is short. UV-protection agents
   contribute only marginally to effective biological control in the
   glasshouse because the decay rates of SeMNPV and Autographa californica
   multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus already ensure a period of exposure to
   active virus that is long enough for caterpillars to acquire a lethal
   concentration under practical conditions. The effect of genetic
   improvement towards shortening the survival time of infected larvae
   depends on the ability to time virus applications accurately and the
   mean time to kill the unmodified virus. Recombinant viruses with a lower
   mean time to kill are more effective than wild-type viruses when applied
   against second, third, and fourth instars because in these stages S.
   exigua infests a considerable number of plants and the rate of foliage
   consumption increases rapidly. When applied against first instars that
   infest only a small number of plants and have low consumption rates,
   recombinants will only be slightly more effective than wild-type
   viruses. In the case of an unmodified virus that already has a
   relatively high mean time to kill, a further reduction in the time to
   kill will not result in improved control. Thus, accurate monitoring
   followed by virus application is indispensable for adequate control and
   may even alleviate the need for fast killing viruses. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Capsule Two populations of the Eastern Great Reed Warblers, one close to
   settlements and one far away, differed mainly in nest losses which were
   higher at the latter site.
   Aims To compare the breeding ecology of two Japanese populations, and
   with breeding data from Polish sites.
   Methods We studied two sites in 1996. The Seimei site comprises a
   natural reed-bed (Phragmites australis) (2.0 ha) c. 2 km from
   residential areas. The Sakura site occurs as smaller reed-bed (0.8 ha)
   close to residential areas. Field study comprised mainly nest searching
   and nest monitoring.
   Results Breeding density, nest height, number of stems supporting nest,
   clutch size and brood size were not significantly different between
   sites. The proportion of nests built on reed stems standing in the water
   (60\%) was significantly higher at the Seimei site (P < 0.001), and the
   warblers in this habitat experienced significantly higher nesting
   failure (P < 0.05). Predation was a principal cause of failure at both
   sites. Significantly more nests suffered from predation at Seimei (53\%)
   than at Sakura (16\%). Breeding density was higher at both sites
   compared with European populations but it fell within ranges of other
   Japanese populations. Mean first-egg date of first brood does not differ
   between our sites and Polish ones.
   Conclusion The differences between the two Japanese populations and
   between Japanese and Polish populations were relatively small and were
   seen mainly in nest losses, breeding density and proportion of nests
   built over water.}},

Abstract = {{Caldesia grandis Samuelsson is an endangered wetland herb on the brink
   of extinction in the vast area of Mainland China, which holds close to
   one eighth of the world's vascular plant species. The pollination
   ecology and breeding system of C. grandis were investigated from three
   natural populations occurring in two wetlands near the top of Mangshan
   Mountain in Hunan Province, central China. The species is in flower from
   early July to late September with a peak in August. The process of
   flower anthesis in C. grandis begins at about 10.00 am and lasts about
   four- and-one-quarter h. The flowers lasted ca. 5.5 h. Caldesia grandis
   is self-compatible; however, autogamy resulted in lower seed set than
   geitonogamy and xenogamy as well as free pollination. Both pollen
   viability and the seed set in open-pollinated controls at the same site
   were typically high (65.44\% and 71.78\% respectively). Mean pollen:
   ovule ratios in the three populations ranged from 901.75 to 931.354. No
   seed germination was observed, either in the field or in laboratory
   experiments. Propagation is achieved through turions, which commonly
   occur in the inflorescences. Flies (Insecta; Diptera) were the most
   frequent visitors to the flowers of C. grandis; however, bees (Insecta;
   Hymenoptera) composed a larger proportion of effective pollinators.
   Existence analysis revealed a peak of mortality density in mid-May
   corresponding to an environmental sieve in the period following the
   establishment of plantlets. An updated diagnostic of the conservation
   status of C. grandis in China was formulated. The main threats to this
   species are catastrophic events, especially human impact activities
   (agriculture, hobbyists' collections, and infrastructure construction).
   Establishment of a monitoring program is proposed, and both in-situ and
   ex-situ strategies are recommended for effective conservation of C.
   grandis.}},

   field-trapping tests, traps baited with E11,13-14:Ald alone produced the
   highest trap captures of male A, fimbriana, but the other three
   individual compounds did not capture any males. Addition of E11,
   13-14:Ac to E11. 13-14:Ald enhanced trap capture. whereas addition of
   E11-14:Ac had no effect. A ternary blend of E11, 13-14:Ald, E11,
   13-14:Ac, and E11-14:Ac in a 6:41 ratio captured 7.5 times mean males
   per trap than virgin females. E11,13-14:OH inhibited trap capture when
   it was added to E11, 13-14:Ald or the ternary blend. This pheromone
   could be used to monitor populations of A. fimbriana and to control this

Abstract = {{We studied the populations of breeding birds in five reference stands of
   natural mixedwood forest and I I conifer plantations up to 21-years old
   in southern New Brunswick, Canada. Variations of the distribution and
   abundance of birds were related to changes in the plant-species
   composition and structural attributes of their habitat. Bird species
   occurred in plantations in levels of abundance and diversity similar to
   that of reference forest, although community composition was highly
   dissimilar. Species of reference stands were typical of mature,
   mixedwood forest. Species of younger plantations were typical of open,
   early successional, upland habitats. Once the plantations became older
   than 13 years and the tree height exceeded about 5 in, birds typical of
   conifer forest began to invade the habitat, resulting in a mixed-species
   composition. Although cavity-containing snags were rare in the
   plantations, if they did occur in them or near their edge they were used
   by hole-nesting birds. Although we could not study a complete rotation,
   the field data and habitat trajectory suggest that the plantations will
   not support some elements of the avian biodiversity of the natural
   forest in the study area. The mature plantations will be highly
   depauperate in coarse-woody debris, snags, and cavities, and will not
   support species dependent on these critical habitat elements. In
   addition, birds requiring habitat containing trees of larger size and of
   various species, including hardwoods, will not find the mature
   plantations to be suitable. To accommodate the needs of species
   potentially at risk from the extensive development of plantations, the
   following changes in forestry management practices should be instituted:
   (1) retention of natural cavity-trees, snags, coarse-woody debris, and
   hardwood trees and shrubs in residual non-harvested ``islands{''} within
   clear-cuts and plantations; (b) retention of a patchy angiosperm
   component by leaving some areas untreated during herbicide applications;
   and (c) setting aside large areas of natural forest as non-harvested
   protected areas. Although we believe that these mitigations would help
   sustain elements of indigenous biodiversity that are at risk in an
   extensive industrial forest, we stress that these predictions would have
   to be tested through additional research and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Using freshwater cladocerans as an example, this paper explores the
   contributions that genetic analyses are making to the field of invasion
   biology. Most importantly, this approach enables a quantification of the
   incidence of both recent and past invasions. By determining genetic
   divergence between European and North American lineages of cladocerans,
   it is possible to estimate the natural incidence of past exchange
   between these continents. The results of this analysis establish that
   the current pace of species invasions is extraordinary; present rates
   are nearly 50 000 times higher than historical levels. Genetic studies
   can also exploit molecular markers to localize the points of origin of
   invaders. Finally, genetic studies are poised to play an important role
   in monitoring invasions; the DNA bar-coding of life is now simple and
   rapid enough to enable the development of molecular identification
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological relevance of the neutral red retention assay as a
   biomarker in an indigenous earthworm population (Microchaetus sp.)
   exposed to the fungicide copper oxychloride was investigated. Changes in
   earthworm biomass and numbers were monitored and related to changes in
   neutral red retention times of coelomocytes as well as changes in copper
   concentrations in the soil and earthworm body tissues. Results indicated
   that Microchaetus sp. responded sensitively to the copper oxychloride by
   showing an initial decrease in biomass 2 months after spraying started.
   This was followed by a significant decrease in worm numbers after 3
   months. The neutral red retention times of earthworm coelomocytes
   decreased significantly within the first month of treatment and
   correspond to a significant increase in soil copper concentrations, but
   not with an immediate increase in body burdens of copper. More than a
   year after spraying had stopped the worm biomass and numbers were still
   significantly lower in the treated plots compared with the control
   plots. Since the reduction in neutral red retention times could be
   attributed to the presence of copper oxychloride and preceded the
   decline in population density and biomass, we conclude that this
   biomarker has a useful role to play in environmental risk assessment and
   could provide a warning of impending ecological damage. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A support tool system comprising risk and priority analyses was
   illustrated in a geographical information system environment and also
   tested with data from two forest protection areas for comparison of the
   system output. The system is recommended as a management monitoring tool
   for areas where village forest protection at a local level is taking
   place. The geographical area in the eastern part of India is subject to
   scarcity of forest resources and is representative in the context of
   widespread occurrence of local forest protection. Data used were
   topography, hectares protected, population census, distance to forest
   and other villages, degree of forest regeneration, presence of
   plantations, age of protection, surrounding forest resources, and
   population mix. Methods used were digitizing information for the
   systems' different layers, analyses of satellite information, field
   work, gathering of local information, and the application of five
   risk/priority analyses: erosion, ecological and institutional
   sustainability, conflict, and degree of dependency.
   Questions asked were how the different analyses should be interpreted
   and how the system could be kept updated. The results show that the
   system needs resource-demanding and field assistance to be kept dynamic.
   The system is also dependent on the interpretations of the analyses. The
   limits or levels of assistance for forest management depend on the
   resources available. The system illustrates how a tool can be utilized
   for decisions regarding input of resources. It can further be very
   useful in defining and comparing different areas in order to detect
   areas in need of assistance and the type of help needed.}},

Title = {{Detection of coastal saline land uses with multi-temporal landsat images

Abstract = {{Many coastal regions in China are confronted with pressing problems of
   scarce land resources and heavy population. Over the past 30 years,
   considerable parts of coastal tidelands have been enclosed and reclaimed
   for agricultural land uses. To assess, plan, and implement large-scale
   reclamation programs, up-to-date and reliable information concerning the
   nature, areal extent, and physical and chemical characteristics of
   coastal saline lands is essential. This paper reports a remote sensing
   approach to detecting coastal saline land uses in Shangyu City, China,
   by using multi-temporal Landsat images. First, with the aid of
   resolution-sharpened Landsat-7 ETM+ images and their enhanced linear
   features, a visual interpretation is applied to extract individual
   dikes. Based on time series images and local government records, a
   spatial zoning procedure is then used to define six sub-zones with
   different historical years of reclamation. It shows that a total of
   15,668 ha of coastal saline lands were enclosed and reclaimed from 1969
   to 1996. Second, a modified land-use classification system for the study
   area is prescribed, and both unsupervised and supervised classifiers are
   performed for land-use classifications of grouped sub-zones. Information
   obtained from the spatial zoning, Tasseled Cap transformation and
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, is also utilized to facilitate
   the supervised classification process. Finally, a detailed land-use map
   is produced, with an overall classification accuracy of 77.8\%. Results
   show that dominant agricultural land uses of sub-zones are changed with
   historical reclamation years, from saline lands with wildgrass (very
   recently reclaimed) to aqua-farm ponds, to cotton fields, and to paddy
   fields and orchards (very early reclaimed). This transform process is
   primarily affected by soil salinities, and according to a soil survey an
   electrical conductivity of saturation extract decreased from 7.3 ds/m in
   the saline land reclaimed in 1996 to below 2 ds/m in the land reclaimed
   before 1969. The study concludes that multi-temporal remotely sensed
   images are important and effective data sources for monitoring the rapid
   changes of coastal land uses.}},

Abstract = {{Solar ultraviolet radiation, especially UVB (280-320 nm), has been
   hypothesized to be at least partially responsible for adverse effects
   (e.g., declines and malformations) in amphibian species throughout the
   world. Evaluation of this hypothesis has been limited by the paucity of
   high-quality UV dose-response data and reliable estimates of typical UV
   doses that occur in amphibian habitats. In this preliminary risk
   assessment for effects of UV radiation on amphibians, dose-response
   relationships quantified in outdoor experiments were compared with UV
   exposure estimates for 26 wetlands in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   A comparison of wetland doses, derived from model prediction, historical
   data, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characterization, with
   experimental effects levels for green (R. clamitans), northern leopard
   (R. pipiens), and mink (R. septentrionalis) frogs indicated that the
   risk of mortality and malformations due to UV exposure is low for the
   majority of wetlands evaluated. Wetland UV dose, averaged over the
   entire breeding season, exceeded effects doses for mortality for all
   three species in two of the 26 wetlands examined and for one species in
   an additional wetland. On the basis of evidence that shorter term doses
   caused mortality in amphibian larvae, 3-day doses were also evaluated.
   In three of the wetlands examined, 3-day doses in excess of 85\% of full
   sunlight(the level that appeared to trigger effects in controlled
   experimentation) occurred at frequencies ranging 22-100\% for all three
   species and at frequencies ranging from 15\% to 58\% for R. pipiens and
   R. septentrionalis in three additional wetlands. Risk of malformation in
   R. pipiens was apparent in five of the 26 wetlands evaluated. Overall,
   estimated UVB doses in 21 of the wetlands never exceeded experimental
   effects doses for mortality or malformations. These results suggest that
   most amphibians are not currently at significant risk for UVB effects in
   northern Minnesota and Wisconsin wetlands. However, continued reduction
   of ozone and other global climate change effects may increase UV doses
   in wetlands, suggesting that the risk of UV to amphibians should
   continue to be monitored and studied.}},

Abstract = {{In affiliation with the USDA-FS long-term soil productivity program. a
   series of studies have been established in the US gulf coast region to
   monitor the effects of intensive silviculture on site productivity. This
   report presents early results of a study of the interactive effects of
   harvest intensity and cultural treatments on soil C, N, and biological
   processes following the regeneration of two stands of loblolly pine
   (Pinus taeda L.), a 19-year-old stand in St. Helena Pa., LA and a
   27-year-old stand in Tyler Co., TX. Two harvesting intensities (MWT,
   mechanical whole-tree and HFBO, hand felled bole-only removed) were
   combined in a factorial assignment with bedding and herbaceous weed
   control (at St. Helena) or bedding and fertilization (at Tyler). Total C
   and N in 0-15 cm of soil were determined before, 9 and 21 months after
   harvesting. Total C and N in 0-60 cm were measured 2 years after
   harvesting at St. Helena and 3 years after harvesting at Tyler. At Tyler
   N mineralization, soil respiration. and microbial populations were
   monitored before and for 2 years after harvesting. In the 19-year-old
   stand, MWT removed 67\% of the above-ground biomass and 38\% of the
   above-ground N compared to 46\% and 10\% for HFBO. In the 27-year-old
   stand, MWT removed 62\% of the biomass and 35\% of the N, while HFBO
   removed 48\% and 13\%. Harvesting method had no effect on total C or
   total N in surface soil but bedding resulted in higher levels of both I
   years after harvesting. The effect of bedding was still detected 3 years
   after treatment at Tyler but not at St. Helena. Herbaceous weed control
   at St. Helena had no effect on total N in the surface 60 cm of soil but
   significantly reduced total C at 30-60 cm 6 months after treatment.
   Sixteen months after application of 250 kg ha(-1) of diammonium
   phosphate (DAP) at Tyler, the surface 60 cm of mineral soil in
   fertilized plots averaged 373 kg ha(-1) more total N than did soil from
   unfertilized plots. Total C in the surface 60 cm was not effected by
   fertilization. Irrespective of harvesting or cultural treatment, total C
   and total N in the surface 15 cm of soil declined at both sites during
   the first year after harvesting. The declines were 8.2 Mg ha(-1) total
   C. 361 kg ha(-1) total N at St. Helena and 7.6 Mg ha(-1) total C, 380 kg
   ha(-1) total N at Tyler. After 2 years, total C and total N had returned
   to >90\% of pre-harvest levels at both locations. Harvesting intensity
   had no effect on soil temperature. soil respiration, N mineralization,
   or microbial populations. but bedding significantly increased soil
   respiration and N mineralization during the first growing season after
   harvesting. Net N mineralization was not effected by treatments during
   the second year after harvesting, but was lower in the harvested plots
   than in the unharvested reference and inversely related to the
   pre-harvest rate. Fertilization with DAP increased mineral N flux for 2
   months following application, but to a lessor extent than did bedding.
   Nitrification was significantly greater than ammonification in all
   treatments during the first year after harvesting but was equal to or
   less than ammonification during the second growing season and in
   unharvested plots, In these US gulf coast pine stands, harvesting and
   regeneration resulted in significant but transitory perturbation in soil
   processes. All of the processes studies returned to or near pre-harvest
   levels after two growing seasons. Differences in surface biomass
   removal. between whole-tree and bole-only harvesting.
   had no measurable effect on the monitored soil processes during the
   first two growing seasons after harvesting although differences may
   appear later in the rotation. Harvesting, per se. resulted in an
   increase in nitrification but no increase in net N mineralization,
   Bedding incorporated surface organic matter. accelerated microbial
   activity, and increased net N mineralization but before planted pine
   seedlings could benefit from the increased N availability. A prolonged
   release of nutrients from the undisturbed surface residues may be more
   beneficial to productivity of the pine regeneration than the rapid
   mineralization which followed bedding. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Declining red pine, Pinus resinosa (Aitman), stands in the Great Lakes
   region appear to arise from a complex of biotic and abiotic factors. We
   monitored stem and root colonizing beetles in declining and healthy
   plantations in Wisconsin from 1997 to 1999. We also conducted systematic
   field excavations and laboratory isolations of various root pathogens,
   Multiple funnel traps were baited with the synthetic aggregation
   pheromones of the two most common bark beetle (Coleoptera: Scolytidae)
   species in the region, Ips pini (Say) and Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff).
   Lower-stem flight traps were baited with 1:1 (+)-alpha-pinene:75\%
   ethanol, and pitfall traps were baited with 1:1 (-)-alpha-pinene:75\%
   ethanol. Healthy stands had higher populations of predators,
   particularly Thanasimus dubius (F.) (Coleoptera: Cleridae), Platysoma
   cylindrica (Paykull) (Coleoptera: Histeridae), and Platysoma parallelum
   Say than declining stands. Seasonal abundance patterns of predators and
   Ips also varied between declining and healthy stands. Declining stands
   had higher numbers of Ips and lower numbers of predators early in the
   season, whereas healthy stands had higher predator populations in the
   early season. Declining stands had more lower stem infesting bark
   beetles Dendroctonus valens LeConte (Scolytidae) and weevils
   (Curculionidae) Pissodes spp. Surprisingly, healthy stands had more root
   weevils, Hylobius pales (Herbst) and Hylobius radicis Buchanan, and root
   bark beetle Hylastes porculus Erichson, over the entire season. However,
   spatial by temporal patterns again were important. Populations of root
   colonizing insects were higher in healthy stands early in the season,
   but higher in declining stands throughout much of the ovipositional
   period. These results suggest dispersal patterns and overwintering
   behaviors are important in the interactions among herbivores, predators,
   and host plant condition in Red Pine Decline. The principal fungi
   isolated from roots were Leptographium procerum (Kendr.) Wingfield and
   Leptographium terebrantis Barras \& Perry. These were more prevalent in
   declining than healthy stands. Staining fungi were more frequently
   isolated from roots of trees at the pocket margin than from trees in the
   asymptomatic portion of declining stands. Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.)
   Bref, was not isolated from root samples or stem disks, despite 40\%
   recovery in positive controls using the latter method. Likewise,
   Armillaria spp. were not associated with declining plantations. Our
   results further support the view that forest declines are due to complex
   interactions among multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, and exhibit
   particular spatial and temporal patterns. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The reintroduction of anadromous alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus, to
   their historic habitats in the inland waters of the United States and
   Canada, has prompted concerns about possible interactions with a popular
   sport fish, white perch, Morone americana. Both species are now widely
   distributed in northeastern North America. Diets of white perch in Lake
   George, Maine, U. S. A., where alewives were absent, were monitored and
   compared with those of white perch populations that were sympatric with
   anadromous alewives in two coastal Maine lakes, Biscay Pond and North
   Pond. In the presence of introduced alewives, the diet of adult white
   perch became almost exclusively juvenile alewives by late summer in
   ponds where both species were present. White perch that were sympatric
   with alewives were more piscivorus than were Lake George white perch,
   which primarily consumed Cladocera. Not only were alewives the principal
   prey item in the diet of white perch in Biscay and North ponds, but
   adult alewives were largely cannibalistic by August. Thus, success of
   reintroducing anadromous alewives in waters containing white perch may
   be negatively impacted by predation as well as cannibalism.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of breeding and survival parameters is essential to
   assess the population viability of the endangered Hutton's Shearwater
   Puffinus huttoni . This study investigated the accuracy of using field
   signs, an infrared `burrowscope' and inspection hatches to monitor
   burrow occupancy and breeding success. Inspection hatches proved to be
   the most reliable means of measuring burrow occupancy and breeding
   success, and Hutton's Shearwaters appear to tolerate disturbance from
   this method. Data collected from inspection hatches over a 10-year
   period indicate that breeding success has averaged 46.5\%, and that
   70.5\% of burrows are occupied by an incubating bird at the start of the
   breeding season. This occupancy figure suggests that the population of
   Hutton's Shearwaters may be closer to 106 000 breeding pairs than the
   134 000 pairs previously estimated. Annual adult survival is estimated
   to be 93.1\%. These values of breeding success and adult survival are
   very similar to published data on Puffinus species breeding in
   environments free from introduced predators.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of weather and cropping practices on the population
   dynamics of the leafhopper Psammotettix alienus, a vector of wheat dwarf
   virus, is examined. The occurrence of the two annual generations was
   monitored by water traps in winter wheat fields in Central Sweden from
   autumn 1997 to autumn 2000. Surveys were also carried out in unploughed
   fallows, leys and permanent pastures. The results indicate that cold
   weather in early summer affected nymphal development negatively, and
   that the negative effect on population size may persist into the
   following year. On the other hand, warm weather in the autumn may result
   in a large overwintering population. Very few P. alienus were caught
   during weeks with average maximum temperatures<10\&DEG;C, and in warmer
   weather catches increased with temperature. Consequently, late sowing of
   winter wheat decreases oviposition opportunities and the risk of virus
   spread because leafhopper activity ceases as temperatures decrease in
   the autumn. Adults of the spring generation were most abundant in
   fallows. However, phenological data indicated that the progeny were
   unlikely to reach the adult stage because fallows were usually
   terminated before nymphal development was complete.}},

Title = {{Differential body condition and vulnerability to predation in snowshoe

Abstract = {{1. Selection of prey in poor body condition allegedly is a widespread
   phenomenon in predator-prey systems. Yet, it remains unclear to what
   extent such selection reflects impeded prey escape ability due to severe
   malnutrition and/or state-dependent risk taking following lesser changes
   in prey body condition. In systems where prey food availability is
   adequate, few individuals should be severely malnourished and thus
   condition-sensitive predation should be related principally to changes
   in nutritional status that occur irrespective of an individual's
   absolute body condition.
   2. I studied predation in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus , Erxleben)
   when food was abundant, to test the prediction that change in body
   condition would contribute, more than would absolute body condition, to
   vulnerability to predation. Hares (n = 618) were radio-marked and
   monitored for survival while body condition was indexed during bimonthly
   livecaptures. A subsample of animals (n = 36) was equipped with
   motion-sensitive transmitters and activity patterns were examined in
   relation to the body condition index and vulnerability to predation.
   3. Manipulation of hare nutritional status via food supplementation
   improved hare body condition but did not affect vulnerability to
   predation; reduction of nematode parasite numbers did not improve hare
   condition but reduced predation among female hares. Reproductive status
   affected predation in both sexes, with recently pregnant females and
   non-scrotal males being less vulnerable to predation. Heavier males also
   tended to experience lower predation rates.
   4. Predation rates for both female and male hares were higher among
   individuals having recently experienced condition deterioration but not
   among animals considered to be in poor absolute condition. Yet, the
   parameter representing change in condition was the last to enter
   survival models, indicating a relatively modest effect of this factor on
   hare vulnerability to predation. Mammalian but not avian predators
   tended to kill hares in declining condition, and hare activity patterns
   were not correlated either to change in condition or to survival.
   5. These findings indicate that nutritional status may influence
   vulnerability to predation even when food is abundant, but that such
   effects occur indirectly through changing body condition. This implies
   that hares are likely to forage in a risk-prone manner when subject to
   worsening condition.}},

Abstract = {{1. Nest densities of the common wasp (Vespula vulgaris (L.)) were
   monitored at six sites for 13 years in the honeydew-rich southern beech
   (Nothofagus spp.) forests of New Zealand's South Island.
   2. Densities of wasp nests were among the highest in the world, up to 30
   ha (-1), and at any one site varied approximately twofold over the study
   period.
   3. Strong but not overcompensating density dependence was identified,
   together with a negative effect of spring rainfall.
   4. The density dependence appeared to act from the number of autumn
   queens produced during one year to the number of mature (autumn) nests
   the next year, rather than through variations in queen production per
   nest. The same stage was also responsible for most of the variability in
   autumn nest numbers from year to year, with queen production per nest
   contributing less.
   5. Yearly changes in nest density could be summarized by a simple Ricker
   model including both density dependence and weather, thereby
   incorporating both previous hypotheses for the determination of wasp
   abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in population densities of the apple sawfly Hoplocampa
   testudinea (Klug) and its parasitoid Lathrolestes ensator (Brauns) were
   monitored in 15 apple orchards for a period of up to 4 years. The
   parasitoid species was found in all orchards except one, and was more
   numerous in plantings on sandier soils. Post-bloom insecticide
   applications against other pests, and carbaryl for fruit thinning, often
   decimated both host and parasitoid in integrated pest management
   orchards. In organic orchards, where synthetic pesticides are banned,
   and Quassia is the only remedy against sawfly, the pest is more
   problematic. The low levels of parasitism in all organic orchards,
   except one, were possibly due to the application of wettable sulphur
   during the parasitoid flight period. The sawfly usually recovers more
   quickly than its parasitoid when chemical control is discontinued,
   because propagation of L. ensator is limited in various ways. The
   parasitoid is time limited, because suitable second instar host larvae
   are rarely available for more than a week on a single apple variety.
   Moreover, parasitism levels stay moderate because the parasitoid females
   do not avoid superparasitism. Finally, relatively more sawflies than
   parasitoids emerge after 10 months underground, because the incidence of
   prolonged diapause is more elevated in L. ensator than in the sawfly. It
   is suggested that both the high incidence of prolonged diapause and the
   inability to avoid superparasitism are useful in reducing the risk of
   local extinction. Elevated sawfly attack in a single early apple variety
   would reduce exploitation of suitable host larvae in other nearby
   varieties, in as far as the parasitoid is not able to distinguish
   fruitlets with accessible second instar host larvae from those with
   inaccessible older larvae. Although the former are available for a
   limited time, the latter may keep the parasitoids from moving to the
   less abundant second instar larvae in late(r) varieties. Reduction of
   elevated host density in such an early variety by a properly timed
   application of a short-lived pesticide, such as Quassia, increases
   parasitism levels proportionally, and is expected to promote parasitoid
   movement to host larvae in other varieties nearby.}},

Abstract = {{Colonization and abundance of soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens
   (Walker), and cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), adults and
   larvae were monitored in cotton and soybean cropping systems in the
   Delta region of Mississippi for three growing seasons (19941996).
   Soybean looper and cabbage looper adults were initially observed in
   pheromone traps during the last week of May or first week of June,
   although adults may have been present in the collection area prior to
   trap establishment. Adult populations of both species remained low until
   early August, after which moth density increased coincident with the
   bloom stages of cotton and soybean. Larvae were first collected from the
   crops when plants were in bloom, with the greatest increase in
   population density occurring in early to mid-August. Although samples
   were not taken after mid-August, looper populations generally decline to
   low levels during September in Mississippi. More soybean looper larvae
   usually were collected from soybean than in cotton, whereas fewer
   cabbage looper larvae were collected from soybean than cotton. Cabbage
   looper larvae were collected in soybean on the same sample date in 1995,
   but approximately 5 wk after soybean looper larvae in 1996. The
   occurrence of soybean and cabbage loopers in cotton and soybean
   agroecosystems in Mississippi appears to be similar to patterns of
   activity recorded for these insects 20 to 40 years ago in other areas of
   the southeastern United States.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA) was used to determine if
   enterococci of human origin were present in a stream (Spout Run) that
   passes through a rural nonsewered community (Millwood, VA). Millwood
   consists of 82 homes, all served by individual septic systems, and Spout
   Run drains a 5800-ha karst topography watershed that contains large
   populations of livestock and wildlife. Periodic monitoring by state
   regulatory officials had resulted in Spout Run being placed on the
   Virginia impaired stream list and Millwood being categorized as an
   at-risk community. Stream samples were collected monthly and analyzed
   for fecal coliforms and enterococci (May 1999-May 2000); ARA was
   performed on enterococci stream isolates on a quarterly basis. All 117
   stream samples were positive for fecal coliforms, and 32\% exceeded the
   Virginia recreational water standard (1000 fecal coliforms/100 mL). A
   library of 1174 known source Enterococcus isolate antibiotic resistance
   profiles was constructed, and yielded correct classification rates of
   94.6\% for 203 human isolates, 93.7\% for 734 livestock isolates, and
   87.8\% for 237 wildlife isolates. Antibiotic resistance analysis of 2012
   enterococcal isolates recovered from stream samples indicated isolates
   of human origin appeared throughout the stream as it passed through
   Millwood, with a yearly average of approximately 10\% human, 40\%
   wildlife, and 50\% livestock. There were no human origin isolates in
   samples collected upstream from Millwood, and the percent human origin
   isolates declined downstream from Millwood. While a human signature was
   found in Spout Run, it was small compared with the proportion of
   isolates from livestock and wildlife.}},

Abstract = {{Virulence is thought to be a driving force in host-pathogen coevolution.
   Theoretical models suggest that virulence is an unavoidable consequence
   of pathogens evolving towards a high rate of intrahost reproduction.
   These models predict a positive correlation between the reproductive
   fitness of a pathogen and its level of virulence. Theoretical models
   also suggest that the demography and genetic structure of a host
   population can influence the evolution of virulence. If evolution occurs
   faster in pathogen populations than in host populations, the predicted
   result is local adaptation of the pathogen population. In our studies,
   we used a combination of molecular and physiological markers to test
   these hypotheses in an agricultural system. We isolated five strains of
   the fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola from each of two wheat
   cultivars that differed in their level of resistance to this pathogen.
   Each of the 10 fungal strains had distinct genotypes as indicated by
   different DNA fingerprints. These fungal strains were re-inoculated onto
   the same two host cultivars in a field experiment and their genotype
   frequencies were monitored over several generations of asexual
   reproduction. We also measured the virulence of these 10 fungal strains
   and correlated it to the reproductive fitness of each fungal strain. We
   found that host genotypes had a strong impact on the dynamics of the
   pathogen populations. The pathogen population collected from the
   moderately resistant cultivar Madsen showed greater stability, higher
   genotype diversity, and smaller selection coefficients than the pathogen
   populations collected from the susceptible cultivar Stephens or a
   mixture of the two host cultivars. The pathogen collection from the
   mixed host population was midway between the two pure lines for most
   parameters measured. Our results also revealed that the measures of
   reproductive fitness and virulence of a pathogen strain were not always
   correlated. The pathogen strains varied in their patterns of local
   adaptation, ranging from locally adapted to locally maladapted.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury levels measured in urine, hair, and saliva of 245 German
   children (8-10 years old) are reported. Mercury concentrations in urine
   ranged between <0.1 and 5.3 mug/l {[}geometric mean (GM) 0.26 mug/l or
   0.25 mug/g creatinine; median for both, 0.22 in mug/l and mug/g,
   respectively]. Using multiple linear regression analysis, two predictors
   have been found accounting for 25.3\% of the variance of mercury levels
   in urine: the number of teeth with amalgam fillings (23.2\%) and the
   number of defective amalgam fillings (2.1\%). The mercury content in
   hair ranged from <0.06 to 1.7 mug/g (GM 0.18 mug/g; median 0.18 mug/g).
   The frequency of fish consumption, the smoking habits of the parents,
   and the age of the children accounted for 20.4\% of the variance of
   mercury levels in hair. The correlation between the hair mercury content
   and urine mercury concentration was low (r = 0.297). Mercury levels in
   saliva ranged between < 0.32 and 4.5 mug/l (median 0.16 mug/l). The
   mercury concentration in saliva was below the limit of quantification of
   0.32 mug/l in more than 70\% of the samples. Mercury analysis in urine
   is suitable to estimate mercury exposure due to amalgam fillings,
   whereas hair mercury better reflects mercury intake by fish consumption.
   Up to now, saliva does not seem to be a suitable tool to monitor the
   mercury burden, at least not at low exposure levels.}},

Abstract = {{Broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae (Pursh) Britt. \& Rusby) is one
   of the most widespread range weeds in North America. The objective of
   this study was to monitor broom snakeweed populations in the salt-desert
   shrub community of the Colorado Plateau and in crested wheatgrass
   (Agropyron desertorum (Link) Schultes) seedings typical of the Snake
   River Plains and Great Basin, and determine if its population cycles are
   related to precipitation patterns. Foliar cover of broom snakeweed and
   associated plant species was measured along 7.6 or 33 m transects by the
   line intercept technique. Density of snakeweed age classes (seedling,
   juvenile, mature) was counted in I m 2 quadrats at the beginning and end
   of each transect. Correlations were made between snakeweed cover and
   density, and seasonal precipitation. The snakeweed population at the
   Colorado Plateau site completed 2 cycles over the 13 year study period,
   dying out in the drought of 1989-90 and again in 2001. There were
   positive correlations between density of snakeweed classes and seasonal
   precipitation: seedlings with spring precipitation (r = 0.63); juveniles
   with winter precipitation (r = 0.69); and mature plants with previous
   fall precipitation (r = 0.62). Only 1 cycle occurred at the Snake River
   Plains site. Following the snakeweed invasion into crested wheatgrass
   seedings in the mid 1980's, the population was at the top of its
   population cycle when the study began in 1990, dropped back and
   fluctuated between 6-10\% cover from 1992 to 1999, and died out in 2001.
   Although density of mature plants did not change much during the middle
   part of the study, the change in snakeweed cover was correlated with
   spring (r = 0.81) and total precipitation (r = 0.60), reflecting
   increase and decrease in size of plants in response to precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) exhibit a variety of
   migration strategies across northern portions of their range. Factors
   reported as being responsible for migration initiation have shown no
   consistent pattern. We monitored 186 radiocollared white-tailed deer
   from 1994 to 1998 in 2 areas of New Brunswick: a southern area with
   moderate and variable winter climate and a northern area with
   consistently severe winter-climate. We determined that deer in the south
   contained a large proportion of conditional migrators (individuals that
   may or may not migrate to winter range in a given year, and may or may
   not remain until spring), whereas deer in the north consisted almost
   entirely of obligate migrators (those that annually migrate to winter
   range lot the duration of winter). Occurrence of conditional migration
   appeared to be a function of climate variability, although distribution
   of the behavior among individual deer was influenced by migration
   distance. Initiation of autumn migration in the south was related to
   snow depth for most deer and represented a response to the proximate cue
   of the onset of limiting conditions. Autumn migration in the north
   appeared to be a response to seasonal cues, and the direct influence of
   snow depth was reduced. Initiation of spring migration in the 2 study
   areas showed a similar pattern. Migration distance may represent a
   factor influencing distribution of migrational cues among individual
   deer within a population. The effect of winter climate variability on
   deer migration behavior may account for the disparity In behavior
   reported in the literature. The differences in migration behavior have
   implications for deer management surveys in northern areas where deer
   yarding occurs. Managers have assumed that deer observed during winter
   surveys were on winter range, but this may not be a reasonable
   assumption in areas with variable winter climates.}},

Title = {{The influence of density on post-weaning growth in roe deer Capreolus
   capreolus fawns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{257}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{303-309}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In temperate ungulates, the body weight of juveniles at the onset of
   winter is a crucial determinant of survival and can also influence
   subsequent reproductive success. However, growth may be retarded
   post-weaning, during winter, as a result of resource restriction and/or
   the demands of thermoregulation in harsh climatic conditions.
   Post-weaning growth rates of juveniles were compared in relation to
   varying density in two populations of roe deer Capreolus capreolus
   (Chize, Dourdan) monitored for 10 and 15 years, respectively. Body
   growth of fawns continued over the post-weaning stage of the juvenile
   period (October-March) at the rate of 0.017 kg/day at Chize and 0.014
   kg/day at Dourdan. Deer density had no influence on this post-weaning
   growth rate of juveniles in their first winter. However, deer born in
   years of high density weighed less at a given date than those born in
   years of low density because of their smaller body size at the onset of
   winter, indicating density-dependent rates of growth before weaning. At
   Chize, the sexes grew at the same rate, but sexual dimorphism was
   apparent as males weighed about 1 kg (8\%) more than females at a given
   date. At Dourdan, no significant sexual dimorphism was detected,
   although females tended to be heavier than males at a given date. We
   conclude that density influences juvenile body weight (through its
   effect on birth weight and/or post-natal growth rate) before weaning in
   this species and, despite continued growth after weaning, during winter,
   roe deer whose early growth is limited through interspecific competition
   cannot compensate for this early restriction.}},

Abstract = {{A 17-year monitoring programme of reef flats at Ko Phuket, Thailand
   afforded an opportunity to evaluate both univariate and multivariate
   measures of environmental stress in an assessment of change on coral
   reef ecosystems. The sites at Ko Phuket suffered the effects of dredging
   in 1986-1987 and then anomalously low sea levels in 1997-1998 as a
   result of climate-related events in the Indian Ocean. Univariate
   measures of species diversity and taxonomic distinctness (Delta{*})
   increased across the reef flat, reflecting the greater effects of
   physical stresses on the inner reef flats (compared with outer reef
   flats) at all sites, with more congeneric species present on the inner
   reef and more confamilial species on the outer reef. Multivariate
   measures showed a clear breakdown in seriation patterns at all sites
   during the dredging in 1987 and in 1998, as a result of earlier negative
   sea-level anomalies. Recovery from environmental disturbances was
   obvious within 12 months in each case. The domination of the reefs by
   massive coral species, which are physiologically adapted to intertidal
   living and which display partial rather than total colony mortality, may
   be a factor contributing to the apparent resilience of the reef flats
   together with continued recruitment and survival of juvenile corals
   during adverse environmental conditions. Elevated sea temperatures and
   extensive bleaching of corals in 1991, 1995, and 1998 had no effect upon
   coral community measures, with many corals recovering their
   zooxanthellae numbers within 3-5 months of the bleaching events.}},

Abstract = {{In conservation planning, it is generally not practical to investigate
   the needs of every species in an area. Focal species analysis is a
   useful tool in protected area planning because it allows conservation
   efforts to target a suite of species that deserve special management
   attention, such as wide-ranging (umbrella), functionally important
   (dominant or keystone), charismatic (flagship), vulnerable, and
   sensitive (indicator) species. Appropriate reserve design requires a
   multi-species approach because no single species can act as a surrogate
   for all other species and ecosystem components. In all cases, focal
   species must be chosen carefully, and assumed ecological roles must be
   validated through research. In Nova Scotia, moose (Alces alces americana
   {[}Gray Linnaeus Clinton] Peterson) is an ideal focal species because it
   meets the functional requirements of all categories of focal species
   analysis. First, habitat conservation for a wide-ranging species such as
   moose will capture habitat for many other species. Second, as major
   herbivores, moose are functionally important within the ecosystems.
   Third, because moose are large and charismatic, and because the mainland
   Nova Scotia herd represents a special remnant native population, support
   for moose conservation should be widespread both publicly and
   scientifically. Fourth, the remnant indigenous sub-population is at
   risk; however, there may be enough moose to recover and persist if
   appropriate conservation strategies are adopted. Last, because moose
   have large area requirements, are long lived, slow to reproduce, and can
   be sensitive to habitat alteration and contamination, they represent a
   good indicator by which environmental quality and change can be
   monitored.}},

Abstract = {{The potential limitations on net leaf carbon assimilation imposed by
   stomatal conductance, carboxylation velocity, capacity for ribulose
   1,5-bisphosphate regeneration and triose phosphate ultilization rate
   were derived from steady-state gas exchange measurements made over the
   life-span of two leaves on plants of an `O-3-sensitive' population of
   Plantago major grown at contrasting atmospheric O-3 concentrations.
   Parallel measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence were used to monitor
   changes in the quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry, and in vitro
   measurements of Rubisco activity were made to corroborate modelled gas
   exchange data.
   Data indicated that a loss of Rubisco was predominantly responsible for
   the decline in CO2 assimilation observed in O-3-treated leaves. The
   quantum efficiency of PSII was unchanged by O-3 exposure.
   Stomatal aperture declined in parallel with CO2 assimilation in
   O-3-treated plants, but this did not account for the observed decline in
   photosynthesis. Findings suggested that O-3-induced shifts in stomatal
   conductance result from `direct' effects on the stomatal complex as well
   as `indirect effects' mediated through changes in intercellular CO2
   concentration. Leaves on the same plant exposed to equivalent levels of
   O-3 showed striking differences in their response to the pollutant.}},

Abstract = {{In a hatchery field trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of two
   sequential injections of erythromycin phosphate in prespawning spring
   chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. For dosing purposes, we used
   fish fork length to estimate weight based on a weight-length
   relationship for spring chinook salmon. All fish in the hatchery
   population (N = 1,568) were injected with one of two doses of
   erythromycin phosphate (20 mg/kg body weight or 40 mg/kg), followed I
   month later by a second injection of 20 mg/kg. We monitored the survival
   of fish after injection and determined the concentrations of
   erythromycin and soluble antigen of Renibacterium salmoninarum in the
   kidneys of each Fish that survived to spawning. After the first
   injection, mortality was significantly higher among female fish
   administered 40 mg/kg than among female fish administered 20 mg/kg. The
   concentration of erythromycin in the kidneys of females at spawning was
   significantly higher than that in the kidneys of males, as was the
   frequency of samples that were positive for the antigen of R.
   salmoninarum. Some of the fish that died demonstrated an apparent
   jaundice condition approximately 2 weeks after the first injection.
   While a higher erythromycin dose may increase the concentration of
   erythromycin in the tissues of chinook salmon, the relative risk of a
   toxic response to erythromycin may be higher than that previously
   reported during controlled laboratory toxicity testing and is likely
   related to unique characteristics associated with fish stock and
   hatchery environment.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how the lethal and non-lethal presence and absence of a
   fish predator, perch (Perca fluviatils), influenced behaviour, numbers
   emerging, size at emergence, and development rate of the damselfly
   Lestes sponsa. The experiment was carried out in outdoor artificial
   ponds and spanned from the egg stage to emergence of the damselflies.
   During the experiment food resources for the damselflies were
   continuously monitored. Damselflies exposed to a lethal predator showed
   a significantly lower activity level than those in the absence of
   predators or subjected to a non-lethal predator. Half-way through the
   larval stage the reduction in activity level was correlated with the
   presence of lethal predators, and at the end of the larval stage with
   higher zooplankton densities. Though larvae decreased activity level,
   size at emergence was larger and development time faster for individuals
   in the lethal predator treatment. Since fewer larvae emerged from that
   treatment we interpret the larger size at emergence to be an effect of a
   combination of thinning and higher zooplankton densities.}},

Abstract = {{Most species of marine turtle breed every two or more years and it is
   the norm for females to lay more than one clutch of eggs within a
   nesting season. Knowing the interval between breeding seasons and the
   clutch frequency (number of clutches laid by an individual in a breeding
   season) of females allows us to assess the status of a nesting
   population. At Alagadi Beach, Northern Cyprus, over a period of 6 years
   (1995-2000), we attributed 96\% of green Chelonia mydas and 80\% of
   loggerhead Caretta caretta turtle clutches to known individual females.
   This intensive level of monitoring enabled us to estimate the clutch
   frequency for both species. Using four different methods we estimated
   clutch frequency to be 2.9-3.1 clutches per female for green turtles and
   1.8-2.2 clutches per female for loggerhead turtles. The median interval
   between nesting seasons for green turtles was 3 years, and for
   loggerhead turtles it was 2 years. Utilizing these parameters and
   available data from other beaches that are monitored regularly, we
   estimate that there are 2,280-2,787 loggerhead and 339-360 green turtles
   nesting annually at these sites in the Mediterranean. This highlights
   the Critically Endangered status of this population of green turtles.
   Furthermore, as conventional beach patrols underestimate clutch
   frequency, these population estimates are likely to be optimistic.}},

Abstract = {{The elephant population of South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park
   increased in number from 11 elephants when the park was created in 1931,
   to 284 elephants in 1998. We studied management records throughout this
   period in conjunction with demographic data, enabling retrospective
   assessment of the long-term impacts of management actions. Problem
   animal control during the 1930s left no sexually mature bulls in the
   population for a period of 9 years, hindering the population's initial
   recovery. Population growth prior to 1954 was also limited by high
   mortality: between 1931 and 1954 inadequate fencing allowed elephants to
   stray outside their protected area resulting in elephants being shot by
   farmers or dying from collisions with trains. Secure elephant-proof
   fencing was constructed in 1954. Subsequently, there was a significant
   decrease in mortality (from 5.0\% to 1.2\%) and an increase in
   population growth (from 3.2\% to 6.1\%). However, evidence suggests that
   confinement might have had a negative impact on survival and social
   behaviour of adult males. We suggest that the concepts of social
   carrying capacities and behavioural conservation of populations need to
   be incorporated into management. The case studies described here
   highlight the importance of treating conservation management and
   research as necessary partners, and monitoring should be an integral
   part of any management plan.}},

Abstract = {{Registration schemes for plant-protection products require applicants to
   assess the potential ecological risk of their products using a tiered
   approach. Standard aquatic ecotoxicity tests are used at lower tiers and
   clearly defined methodologies are available for assessing the potential
   environmental risks. Safety factors are incorporated into the assessment
   process to account for the uncertainties associated with the use of
   lower-tier single-species ecotoxicity studies. If lower-tier assessments
   indicate that a substance may pose a risk to the environment, impacts
   can be assessed using more environmentally realistic conditions through
   the use of either pond mesocosms, artificial streams or field monitoring
   studies. Whilst these approaches provide more realistic assessments, the
   results are difficult to interpret and extrapolation to other systems is
   problematic. Recently it has been recognised that laboratory approaches
   that are intermediate between standard aquatic toxicity tests and
   field/mesocosm studies may provide useful data and help reduce the
   uncertainties associated with standard single-species tests. However,
   limited guidance is available on what tests are available and how they
   can be incorporated into the risk-assessment process. This paper reviews
   a number of these higher-tier laboratory techniques, including modified
   exposure studies, species sensitivity studies, population studies and
   tests with sensitive life stages. Recommendations are provided on how
   the approaches can be incorporated into the risk-assessment process. (C)

Abstract = {{A 4-year study (1997 to 2000) was conducted to determine the
   sensitivities of the potato tuber rot pathogens, Phytophthora
   erythroseptica and Pythium ultimum, to mefenoxam (metalaxyl). A total of
   2,277 tubers showing symptoms of ``water rot{''} were collected from 16
   states and 2 Canadian provinces. From these, 849 isolates of P.
   erythroseptica and 213 isolates of P. ultimum were obtained, and 805 and
   190 isolates, respectively, were tested for their ability to grow on V8
   medium amended at 0.01 to 100 mug/ml with fungicide. Isolates ranged
   widely in their responses to mefenoxam. The presence of resistant
   isolates (EC50 >100 mug ml(-1)) of P erythroseptica in the potato
   producing areas of Maine was confirmed. The presence of R erythroseptica
   isolates in Idaho and Minnesota resistant to mefenoxam is reported for
   the first time. The proportion of R erythroseptica isolates resistant to
   mefenoxam varied from 2.9 to 36.2\% between 1997 and 2000. The
   proportion of resistant P. ultimum isolates represented only a small
   proportion of the isolates tested (3.7\%). A single resistant P. ultimum
   isolate was recovered from Washington, whereas most of the resistant
   isolates obtained (5 of 7) were collected in Minnesota during the final
   year of the study. This is the first report of resistance in P. ultinium
   pathogenic to potato tubers. These observations suggest that pink rot
   and leak could become significant problems in the future, particularly
   in those areas where resistance has been detected. Our results have
   implications for the effective management of water rot. Monitoring the
   sensitivity of the pathogen population to mefenoxam in all production
   areas should be considered and integrated as a part of the overall
   disease management strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Large woody debris was explored as a method of restructuring channelized
   streams to improve salmonid habitat. Whole trees were inserted in
   sections along a 2 km reach of a channelized stream to determine if
   large woody debris: (1) increased the abundance and biomass of brown
   (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss); (2) had an
   effect on physical habitat features; and (3) provided trouts with
   additional habitat. Trout populations and stream morphology were
   monitored before and after the introduction of woody debris and compared
   to control sections lacking woody debris. Abundance and biomass of both
   brown and rainbow trout increased in the treatment section compared to
   the control. Maximum and standard deviation of fish total length
   increased in all sections during summer months. The number of
   individuals and the standard deviations of total lengths decreased in
   the control section in winter, but increased in the treatment section.
   Mean water velocities decreased and number and volume of pools increased
   in treatment sections. Brown and rainbow trouts sought woody debris
   structures for cover. We conclude that large woody debris can serve as a
   method of reconstructing channelized streams to improve salmonid
   habitat. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The locations used by spawning Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in a
   reach of the Gimock Bum, Scotland, were monitored over three successive
   years. Reach discharge was estimated for each spawning observation using
   a conversion factor applied to continuous flow data from a gauge located
   in the catchment. Data on the availability and use of different
   discharges were used to construct a discharge electivity index for the
   reach. The index was compared to output from a Physical HABitat
   SIMulation (PHABSIM) model of the reach.
   Spawning fish used relatively high discharges, with the highest
   electivity value being for a discharge approximately three times the
   reach median flow. The electivity index and the PHABSIM weighted usable
   area (WUA) versus discharge curve were similar across the low flow range
   and both suggested similar optimum discharges for spawning (1.1 and 1.4
   m(3) s(-1) respectively). However, electivity values suggested
   unsuitable conditions were reached at discharges greater than 1.4 m(3)
   s(-1) whereas PHABSIM predicted relatively high WUA values at discharges
   up to 2 m(3) s(-1).
   Electivity indices provide an insight into discharge selection that is
   not dependent on hydraulic simulations or assumptions about microhabitat
   (depth, velocity, substrate) preferences. Moreover, they can be used to
   assess discharge suitability in hydraulically complex streams where the
   one-dimensional hydraulic models used by PHABSIM may be inappropriate.
   However, unlike PHABSIM, they cannot be used to predict the suitability
   of flows outside observed discharge ranges and so are limited in their
   application. Further work is required to refine the methodology and
   assess its transferability to other streams. Nonetheless, indices may
   represent a useful tool that can be used to complement other methods of
   assessing instream flow needs. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Distribution of the Mediterranean hake populations (Merluccius

Abstract = {{On the basis of trawl survey data collected during the MEDITS project
   (1994-1999), the distribution of Mediterranean hake populations was
   described in coastal areas corresponding to about three quarters of both
   the latitudinal and longitudinal extensions of the Mediterranean Sea,
   and in the 0-800 m range. Abundance and biomass indices (in terms of
   number and kg per km(2)) are presented in 15 geographical sectors and 40
   subareas from the Alboran Sea to the Aegean Sea. A statistical analysis
   by generalized linear modelling performed on such indices per main
   national blocks (Greece, France, Italy and Spain), and considering the
   effects of the six years of sampling and the depth, showed that biomass
   increased from west to cast, while for all areas the most significant
   depth effect appeared between 100 and 200 in, corresponding to the depth
   range that hosts most of the summer nursery areas. The overall
   size-frequency distributions in shelf and slope waters, average sizes
   and total mortality coefficient Z per sector showed that the bulk of the
   MEDITS samples consisted of young individuals and, with only a few
   exceptions (western Sardinia, central Aegean), a generalized condition
   of growth overfishing was apparent. However, no negative trend was
   found, either in biomass or in average size of fishes, during the six
   years of the present study. Recruitment patterns were studied by
   distinguishing the youngest fish as Gaussian groups (modal length from 6
   to 9 cm total length) in length-frequency distributions of each subarea
   and main stratum (shelf and slope). Considering the timing of MEDITS
   surveys (May-July), this approach emphasised the nurseries in the
   northern part of the western Mediterranean (Gulf of Lions, Ligurian Sea,
   northern Tyrrhenian Sea) and in the northern central Mediterranean,
   where recruitment occurs mainly during spring. On the other hand, few
   recruits were found in part of the central and particularly in the
   eastern Mediterranean, where recruitment occurs mainly in summer. MEDITS
   recruitment patterns therefore gave support to distinctions among
   Mediterranean hake populations, previously suggested on the basis of
   vertebral counts and other morpho-physiological, albeit fragmentary,
   data. In particular the central Mediterranean hake populations do not
   seem to be homogeneous, with an Adriatic unit very close to the
   northwestern one. The MEDITS experience therefore suggests that future
   management measures could take into account both general and regional
   patterns, the latter concerning mainly the younger fraction of the
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Influenza (flu) is a common infectious disease, but it is unusual in
   that the primary timescales for disease dynamics (epidemics) and viral
   evolution (new variants) are roughly the same. Recently, extraordinarily
   reliable phylogenetic reconstructions of flu virus evolution have been
   made using samples from both extant and extinct strains. In addition,
   because of their public health importance, flu epidemics have been
   monitored throughout the period over which the phylogenetic trees
   extend. In parallel with this empirical work, theoretical ecologists
   have developed mathematical and computational models that elucidate many
   properties of multistrain systems. In the future, to unravel and
   interpret the complex interactions between ecological and evolutionary
   forces on flu dynamics, the documented evolution of the virus must be
   related to the observed population dynamics of the disease. New
   theoretical insights are also required to simplify model structures and
   facilitate predictions that can be tested with accessible data.}},

Abstract = {{Start-up of two acidogenic reactors under mesophilic (37degreesC) and
   thermophilic (55degreesC) conditions was carried out with methanogenic
   granular sludge as an inoculum and dairy wastewater as feed. During
   these 71 days of the start-up period, microbial community dynamics in
   these two acidogenic reactors, as monitored by denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) and dot-blot hybridization with group-specific
   oligonucleotide probes, was correlated to reactor performance. Due to pH
   drop to 5.5, DGGE community fingerprints for domains Bacteria and
   Archaea populations showed significant shifts after 13 days of
   operation, and this change was accompanied with an increase in volatile
   fatty acid production, a decrease in methane formation, and rapid sludge
   disintegration, Dot-blot hybridization results further indicated that
   the decrease in methane production was related to the decrease in
   Archaea population in particular with methanogens from 34.1\% of total
   16S-rRNA in the seed sludge to 8\% within the first 13 days, and to 25\%
   at day 71. Among the methanogens monitored, the class Methanomicrobiales
   was the most abundant followed up by Methanobacteriales and
   Methanococcales. Due to an elevated temperature, the microbial community
   change was more significant and rapid in the thermophilic reactor than
   in the mesophilic reactor. Significant microbial population changes took
   place at the first 13 days for both reactors, but a longer period up to
   71 days was required to establish a microbial community with a stable
   metabolic activity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{448-460}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{We characterized the size and species composition of the weed seedbank
   after 35 yr of continuous crop rotation and tillage system treatments at
   two locations in Ohio. Spring seedbanks were monitored during 1997,
   1998, and 1999 in continuous corn (CCC), corn-soybean (CS), and
   corn-oats-hay (COH) rotations in moldboard plow (MP), chisel plow (CP),
   and no-tillage (NT) plots where the same herbicide was used for a given
   crop each growing season. There were 47 species at Wooster and 45
   species at Hoytville, with 37 species occurring at both location sin all
   3 yr. Crop rotation was a more important determinant of seed density
   than was tillage system. Seed density was highest in NT and generally
   declined as tillage intensity increased. Seeds accumulated near the
   surface (0 to 5 cm) in NT but were uniformly distributed with depth in
   other tillage systems. At both locations there was a significant
   interaction between tillage and rotation for estimates of the total seed
   density. Seed density was highest in NT-CCC, with 26,850 seeds m 2 at
   Wooster and 8,680 seeds m(-2) at Hoytville. At Wooster total seed
   density in CCC plots was 45 and 60\% lower than in COH plots for CP and
   MP. In NT the total seed density was 40\% greater in CCC than in COH. At
   Hoytville total seed density in CCC plots was 72\% lower than in COH
   plots that were CP or NIP, whereas seed density was 45\% higher in CCC
   than in COH plots that were in an NT system. There were more significant
   differences in seedbank density for any given species for crop rotation
   than for tillage treatments. Seed densities of three broadleaves
   (shepherd's-purse, Pennsylvania smartweed, and corn speedwell) at
   Wooster and four broadleaves (yellow woodsorrel, redroot pigweed,
   Pennsylvania smartweed, and spotted spurge) at Hoywille were more
   abundant in COH (140 to 630 seeds m(-2)) than in CS (10 to 276 seeds
   m(-2)) or CCC (<1 to 60 seeds m(-2)), regardless of the tillage system.
   At both locations Pennsylvania smartweed seeds were more abundant in COH
   (260 and 630 seeds m(-2)) than in other rotations (10 to 20 seeds
   m(-2)). Relative importance (RI) values, based on relative density and
   relative frequency of each species, were lower in CS than in CCC for
   common lambsquarters and five other weeds at Wooster; RI of giant
   foxtail was 80\% lower in COH than in CCC at Hoytville. The data
   show-how species composition and abundance change in response to crop
   and soil management. The results can help to determine how complex plant
   communities arc ``assembled{''} from a pool of species by specific
   constraints or filters.}},

Abstract = {{In autumn the vast majority of the North American population of Eared
   Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) congregates for several months at Great
   Salt Lake, Utah, and Mono Lake, California. Because the lakes are so
   large, it has not been possible to monitor grebe migration with
   sufficient accuracy to determine when peak numbers are reached. To
   clarify migration phenology, we analyzed data from 2 isolated wetland
   areas in southwestern Wyoming where grebes land en route between
   breeding areas in the interior and Great Salt Lake. Occasional birds,
   probably non-breeders or failed breeders, begin moving southward as
   early as mid-June. Migration of postbreeding birds starts in late July,
   peaks in late August and September, and is largely completed by the end
   of October, with very small numbers arriving into,November. The pattern
   of migration and number of birds encountered varied annually, but 95\%
   of the migration was usually completed by 15 October. As a result,
   censuses at the major staging lake made on or after 15 October but
   before the grebes depart for wintering areas can be used to study trends
   in size of the North American population.}},

Title = {{Sex determination and sex differentiation in fish: an overview of
   genetic, physiological, and environmental influences}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{208}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{191-364}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{A great deal of information is known regarding the process of sex
   differentiation in fish, and the mechanisms involved in primary sex
   determination are now beginning to be defined. A range of gonadal
   differentiation types have been described for fish, including
   gonochoristic species possessing purely ovarian or testicular tissues,
   as well as hermaphroditic species that can initially mature either as
   males (protandrous) or females (protogynous). Sex determination in fish
   is a very flexible process with respect to evolutionary patterns
   observed among genera and families, and within individuals is subject to
   modification by external factors. These influences can affect the fate
   of both somatic and germ cells within the primordial gonad, and include
   the action of genetic, environmental (e.g. temperature), behavioural,
   and physiological factors. Exogenous sex steroids administered at the
   time of sex determination can strongly influence the course of sex
   differentiation in fish, suggesting that they play a critical role in
   assignment of gonad determination as well as subsequent differentiation.
   Detailed information is available from fish systems describing the
   production of sex steroids, as well as the enzymes involved in steroid
   production. Both estradiol and the maturation hormone 17alpha,
   20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3 -one (17alpha, 20beta-DP) are produced by a
   two-step process involving different cell layers in the gonad, and have
   effects on the differentiation of gonadal and nongonadal tissues.
   Gonadal development and differentiation in some fish is also controlled
   by hormones from the pituitary gland (gonadotropins) that are regulated
   by release hormones (GnRH) and other neuroendocrine and gonadal factors.
   Genetic determination of sex in fish can involve monogenic or polygenic
   systems, with factors located on the autosomes or on sex chromosomes. In
   the latter case, both male (XY) and female (ZW) heterogametic systems
   have been described, as well as many subtle variations on these themes.
   Sex chromosomes are found in approximately 10\% of fish species
   examined, and sex-linked phenotypic traits, and protein and molecular
   genetic markers have been identified in several fish systems. Some
   species of fish reproduce gynogenetically, producing all-female
   populations. Several gene families known to be involved in sex
   determination in other vertebrates have recently been shown to be
   similarly involved in fish,. suggesting conservation of sex
   determination pathways. The lability of sex-determination systems in
   fish makes some species sensitive to environmental pollutants capable of
   mimicking or disrupting sex hormone actions. Such observations provide
   important insight into potential impacts from endocrine disruptors, and
   can provide useful monitoring tools for impacts on aquatic environments.

Abstract = {{The precision of elephant estimates from aerial sample surveys and dung
   counts is inversely proportional to abundance. West African elephant
   populations are already small, and the power of a monitoring programme
   to detect changes in abundance diminishes as the population shrinks in
   size. Thus it will be difficult to evaluate the effects on elephant
   numbers of new management policies in West Africa. The same will be true
   of monitoring schemes for antelope and primate populations that are
   hunted for bushmeat. Elephant estimates from dung counts are more
   precise than those from aerial sample surveys, and changes in elephant
   numbers are more likely to be detected in the subregion by dung counts
   than by aerial sample surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Body mass is often considered as a good indicator of body condition of
   individuals in ungulates, hence of their fitness, and thus, may be used
   as an index to monitor the status of populations subject to harvesting
   schemes. Here, we report the influence of annual rainfall (a proxy for
   primary production) and habitat on the body mass of impala in a
   population cropped for meat in a communal area of Zimbabwe. We analyzed
   the data from 2 contrasted years for rainfall, in two different
   habitats. In the good year (i.e. high annual rainfall) impala were
   heavier than in the poor year, and adult females seemed to be less
   affected than males by variation in primary production. We show that
   adult males were suffering from a seasonal decrease in body mass,
   supposedly linked to the rut, particularly in good habitat. Overall, the
   habitat effect appeared to be dominated by the rainfall effect, and this
   may be due to the very high animal densities in the good habitat, i.e.
   fast resource depletion. Our results also suggest that males (juvenile
   and adult) are more susceptible to changes in food resource abundance
   and quality than females, which supports previous studies on sexually
   dimorphic and polygynous species.}},

Abstract = {{The sea cucumber fishing crisis in Galapagos is an example of the
   potential consequences of rapid migration, growing economic competition,
   and weak regulatory mechanisms. In a short period of time sea cucumber
   fishing has become the most inflammatory issue in the Galapagos. The key
   factors that allowed for the efficient exploitation of the new resource
   were not the fishermen themselves but rather the new fishing techniques
   and access to credit and markets. This suggests that the annual sea
   cucumber crisis is due to factors more complex than simply more
   fishermen generating greater sea cucumber catches. This paper examines
   census data and fisher registries to analyze population growth in the
   islands. A public opinion survey is used to determine the population's
   attitudes toward sea cucumber fishing and regulations. Qualitative
   interviews explore the history of the sea cucumber boom. Information
   from the sea cucumber monitoring program provides estimates for the
   annual sea cucumber catches.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Animals resident on small islands provide excellent opportunities to
   carry out detailed mark-recapture studies. Populations are closed and
   ecosystems are often simpler than those of mainland sites. These factors
   enable the study of cryptic species that have otherwise been neglected.
   Snakes are notable for their secretive nature and, as a result, few
   natural populations have been accurately described through long-term
   mark-recapture monitoring. A population of tiger snakes (Notechis
   scutatus ) was studied on Carnac Island, a small limestone island (16
   ha) off the coast of Western Australia. Population estimates show that
   snake density is very high, with more than 20 adult snakes per ha. This
   equates to a biomass of more than 100 kg of a top predator concentrated
   in a very small area. Such a high predator density can be explained
   because adult snakes feed mainly on chicks of nesting birds that breed
   in large colonies on Carnac but forage elsewhere. Substantial annual
   growth rates in body size in most individuals suggest that food
   availability is high on Carnac. Growth rates decreased more sharply in
   adult females than in males, whereas annual changes in body mass were
   similar in both sexes, probably because of the high energetic costs of
   reproduction experienced by females. Surprisingly, the sex ratio was
   highly biased, with males largely outnumbering females.}},

Abstract = {{The species composition, reproductive ecology, and patterns of activity
   were determined for an anuran assemblage of an area of subtropical
   montane forest in northwest Argentina. Twenty-four species were recorded
   at Parque Nacional Calilegua, Province of Jujuy. This study reflects a
   75\% increase in the number of species reported in previous surveys.
   Most species inhabiting the park are mainly from adjacent Chacoan
   regions and only six taxa are known to be endemic from montane forest
   areas. Most species are aquatic breeders, and the absence of many forest
   reproductive modes is noticeable. Although baseline information to
   compare former community composition was lacking, comparisons based on
   museum specimens revealed no evidence of local population extinctions.
   Immediate intensive monitoring is needed to quantitatively address
   amphibian population fluctuations and to examine the effectiveness of
   present-day montane forest protection. Although long-term population
   monitoring and documentation of species declines is lacking, I propose a
   list of seven species of conservation concern in order to assist and
   promote future monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteers counted lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros)
   emerging from 79 roosts throughout Wales prior to parturition over a
   5-year period. Analysis of the count data and environmental variables
   revealed that there was no statistically significant change in the
   number of bats counted during the monitoring period. A maximum count of
   5118 lesser horseshoe bats for one of the years of the study, suggests a
   Welsh population of > 10.000. Within years, date had a strong influence
   on roost count with higher counts occurring later in the year. Analyses
   of roosts for which data was available in most years failed to find any
   evidence of changes in number of emerging bats over time either between
   roosts or across geographical regions. Over the time period studied, the
   population of R. hipposideros was stable. Power analysis suggested that
   the present monitoring programme should be able to detect a 5\% increase
   or decrease over a 5-year period and could detect smaller trends over
   longer periods of time even when some data were missing. Roost Surveys
   can therefore be a valuable tool to assess the status of a bat species,
   alert conservationists to population declines and provide feedback
   regarding the success of conservation management for bats. (C) 2002

Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Grey-headed Quail-dove Geotrygon caniceps has traditionally been
   considered a polytypic species endemic to Cuba and the Dominican
   Republic and treated as globally threatened within the most recent Red
   Data Book (BirdLife International 2000). Chapman (1917) described
   Geotrygon leucometopius of Hispaniola as specifically distinct from G.
   caniceps of Cuba based on 10 specimens, taken by Rollo Beck in the
   Dominican Republic. Subsequently, Bond (1936, 1956) merged leucometopius
   within caniceps, an arrangement that has persisted, unchallenged in the
   technical literature, until the present. Through examination of 76
   specimens, extensive field experience of Cuban birds, and less
   exhaustive fieldwork in the Dominican Republic, we re-evaluate the
   taxonomic status of the Hispaniolan population, identifying consistent
   differences in coloration, tail length and characteristics of the second
   to fifth primaries between it and the Cuban population. Based on these
   differences, we suggest that caniceps (endemic to Cuba) and
   leucometopius (restricted to the Dominican Republic) be henceforth
   resurrected to species status. We were unable to undertake a complete
   analysis of the vocalizations of the two forms, due to the lack of
   definite recordings from Hispaniola, but present sonograms and notes
   concerning Cuban birds. Further work, including molecular analyses,
   would be clearly desirable to test our hypothesis. Both forms are
   undoubtedly declining due to habitat destruction and hunting, and both
   certainly qualify as Vulnerable under current IUCN criteria. Indeed,
   leucometopius may even qualify as Endangered under the range criterion.
   Its status requires particularly careful monitoring, while new
   information, published since the BirdLife International (2000) review of
   globally threatened birds, suggests that the range even of nominate
   caniceps is considerably smaller than previously considered.}},

Abstract = {{Overall male reproductive success was investigated in a Japanese black
   pine (Pinus thunbergii Parl.) clonal seed orchard consisting of 16
   nematode-resistant clones, using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
   markers. We genotyped all 16 of the orchard clones at selected RAPD loci
   by analyzing diploid needles and 10 haploid megagametophytes from each
   of them. In addition, the male parent of open-pollinated seedlings was
   identified by comparing their phenotypes with the genotypes of the
   orchard clones. In this way the male parents of 559 seedlings of 648
   seedlings of progenies from 14 parental (orchard) clones were
   determined. The level of external pollen contamination in the seed
   orchard was estimated to be 2.2\% for the total population. The
   effective mean selfing rate observed was 1.5\%. Male reproductive
   success among clones varied widely, from 0.8 to 24.4\%, for the total
   population. Our data suggest that the significant deviation in male
   reproductive success of individual clones from panmictic ratios may be a
   problem for the genetic quality in seed orchard crops. To improve the
   parental balance of seed orchard crops, the use of artificial management
   techniques such as gibberellin A(4/7) treatment, supplemental mass
   pollination, and rearrangement of clonal ramets is recommended in seed
   orchards.}},

Abstract = {{The spatialization of population of counties in China is significant.
   Firstly, we can gain the estimated values of population density adaptive
   to different kinds of regions. Secondly, we can integrate effectively
   population data with other data including natural resources,
   environment, society and economy, build I km GRIDs of natural resources
   reserves per person, population density and other economic and
   environmental data, which are necessary to the national management and
   macro adjustment and control of natural resources and dynamic monitoring
   of population. In order to establish population information system
   serving national decision-making, three steps ought to be followed: 1)
   establishing complete geographical spatial data foundation
   infrastructure including the establishment of electric map of residence
   with high resolution using topographical map with large scale and high
   resolution satellite remote sensing data, the determination of attribute
   information of housing and office buildings, and creating complete set
   of attribute database and rapid data updating; 2) establishing complete
   census systems including improving the transformation efficiency from
   census data to digital database and strengthening the link of census
   database and geographical spatial database, meanwhile, the government
   should attach great importance to the establishment and integration of
   population migration database; 3) considering there is no GIS software
   specially serving the analysis and management of population data, a
   practical approach is to add special modules to present software system,
   which works as a bridge actualizing the digitization and spatialization
   of population geography research.}},

Abstract = {{Inventory, monitoring, and experimental studies have been the primary
   approaches for documenting and understanding the problem of amphibian
   declines. However, little attention has been given to placing
   human-caused perturbations affecting one or more life-history stages in
   the context of the overall population dynamics of particular species. We
   used two types of ecological sensitivity analysis to determine which
   vital rates have the strongest influence on the population dynamics of
   western toads ( Bufo boreas ), red-legged frogs ( Rana aurora ), and
   common frogs ( Rana temporaria ), pond-breeding amphibians that have
   declined in all or portions of their ranges. Our results suggest that
   post-metamorphic vital rates and highly variable vital rates both have a
   strong influence on the population dynamics of these species and
   therefore deserve more research and management attention. Ecological
   sensitivity analysis should be more widely applied to the issue of
   amphibian declines in order to identify the most plausible mechanisms of
   decline and prioritize which life-history stages should be the focus of
   research and management efforts. Future experimental studies of
   perturbations in one or more life-history stage should attempt to link
   the magnitude of the perturbation measured with the overall
   population-level consequences. Finally, current research, inventory, and
   monitoring efforts should be supplemented with demographic studies so
   that quantitative analyses can be applied to a wider range of species
   and life-history groups.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) survives in an area
   of pronounced habitat diversity in southern Florida, occupying extensive
   home ranges that encompass a mosaic of habitats. Twenty-one years of
   daytime monitoring via radiotelemetry have provided substantial but
   incomplete information about panther ecology, mainly because this method
   fails to capture movement and habitat use between dusk and dawn, when
   panthers are most active. Broad characterizations of panther habitat
   suitability have nonetheless been derived from telemetry-based habitat
   selection studies, focusing narrowly on forests where daytime resting
   sites are often located. The resulting forest-centered view of panthers
   attributed their restricted distribution and absence of population
   growth in the mid-1990s to a scarcity of unfragmented forest for
   expansion. However, the panther population has doubled since the
   beginning of genetic restoration in 1995, increasing five-fold in public
   areas described as unsuitable based on forest criteria. Although the
   forest-centered view no longer explains panther distribution, it
   continues to shape management decisions and habitat conservation
   policies. The assumptions and limitations of this view therefore merit
   critical examination. We analyze the role of forests in the ecology of
   the Florida panther. To address the absence of nighttime telemetry data,
   we use innovative telemetry mapping techniques and incorporate
   information from field observations indicating habitat use during active
   hours (e.g., tracks, scats, urine markers, and kill sites). We consider
   daytime telemetry data in the context of panther home ranges and
   breeding units. We analyze home range size in relation to the amount of
   forest within each range, concluding that percent forest cover is a poor
   predictor of size. We apply fractal analysis techniques to characterize
   the relative density of forest cover associated with daytime locations
   and interpret the results in terms of spatial landscape patterns,
   highlighting the limitations of daytime telemetry data for
   characterizing overall habitat use. We conclude that the forest-centered
   view of panther habitat selection is based on an uncritical evaluation
   of telemetry data collected prior to the recent population expansion and
   on the unsupported assumption that day bed habitats are representative
   of nighttime habitat use. We find that numerous factors contribute to
   habitat suitability and population density and distribution, and that P.
   concolor in Florida, as elsewhere in their range, are habitat
   generalists, exploiting the broad spectrum of available habitats for
   hunting, resting, mating, travel, denning, and dispersal. Whereas
   panthers readily use forested habitat with understory and prey, we find
   no support for the view that only the forested land within a habitat
   mosaic is potential panther habitat, or for the contention that only
   forested habitats are used by panthers within existing home ranges. We
   suggest a more ecologically consistent management and recovery paradigm
   based on maintaining the integrity of the system of overlapping home
   ranges that characterizes panther social structure and satisfies
   breeding requirements. Such a paradigm focuses on the requirements for
   reproductive success of a small population in a changing environment.}},

Abstract = {{A fractal landscape realizer has been developed that generates synthetic
   landscape maps to user specifications. The alternative landscape
   realizations are not identical to the actual maps after which they are
   patterned, but are similar statistically (i.e., the areas and fractal
   character of each category are replicated). A fractal or self-affine
   pattern generator is used to provide a spatial probability surface for
   each category in the synthetic map. The Fractal Realizer arbitrates
   contentions among categories in a way that makes it possible to preserve
   the fractal patterns of all the categories in the resulting synthetic
   landscape. Each synthetic landscape is one equally likely realization
   from among an infinite ensemble of possible fractal landscape
   combinations. Synthetic landscapes produced by the Fractal Realizer have
   been tested using a variant of the Turing Test. More than 100 map
   experts were presented with a series of 20 selections of paired maps,
   and asked to distinguish the real map from the synthetic realization.
   The resulting population of scores was not significantly different from
   a random binomial, suggesting that the experts were unable to discern
   the synthetic maps from the actual ones. Statistical landscape indices
   computed for 25 different synthetic realizations are compared with the
   values computed for the actual maps. The Fractal Realizer can be used as
   a stochastic generator of synthetic input maps to a spatially explicit
   simulation model to test the effects of landscape rearrangement on the
   uncertainty of model parameter estimates. The sensitivity of stochastic
   spatial simulations to prescribed input landscapes can be evaluated by
   supplying them with a series of synthetic maps that obey particular
   statistical characteristics and by monitoring changes in selected output
   responses. Statistically similar input landscapes with different spatial
   arrangements can be generated and supplied to spatial models as a hedge
   against pseudoreplication.}},

Abstract = {{Endangered Species Act recovery plans have come under increased scrutiny
   in both political and academic arenas as species are continually added
   to the endangered species list but few are removed. To promote more
   effective recovery planning, the Society for Conservation Biology, in
   partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National
   Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, sponsored a collaborative
   project among 19 universities to systematically review a large
   representative sample of recovery plans. The primary goals of the
   project were to gather data about the content and characteristics of
   each sampled recovery plan; to analyze these data to identify important
   differences, patterns, and trends among the population of plan; and to
   use these results to inform recommendations for how the recovery
   planning process could be improved. We developed and used a detailed
   data collection Instrument to consider and characterize specific
   attributes of each sampled recovery plan. Topics covered by the
   Instrument included descriptive attributes of the plan and subject
   species, information about species' biology, threats to species,
   prescribed management actions, monitoring protocols, plan
   administration, public relations, and the criteria against which
   recovery was measured. Using a standardized data collection Instrument
   helped to ensure that data collection was systematic and consistent.
   Data were compiled into a single large database that could then be
   queried for quantitative, statistical analyses. We describe the methods
   used to sample recovery plans, develop the Instrument, calibrate data
   collection, and conduct recovery plan reviews. Finally, we note
   potential benefits and limitations of this collaborative project.}},

Abstract = {{We asked two basic questions about endangered species recovery plans:
   (1) Have recovery plans improved over the last decade? (2) Are important
   features of recovery plans biased toward plants or animals? We answer
   these questions in the context of a large national study aimed at
   statistically summarizing key features of recovery plans and how those
   plans use science. In addition, we asked if the status of endangered
   species tends to be improving. Overall, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service (USFWS) is improving in its use of science in recovery plans.
   For example, based on the increased number of monitoring tasks included
   in more recent plans, the USFWS is becoming more concerned with the need
   to monitor changes in endangered species populations and their habitats.
   Similarly, specific recovery criteria, such as the number of years that
   a species needs to maintain a target population size, are more often
   being included in recovery plans. However, several features of recovery
   plans have not shown improvement, such as the tasks recommended to
   address major threats and the limited influence of focal species'
   biology on the selection of recovery criteria and monitoring protocols.
   Recovery plan features tend to be biased toward animals in several ways.
   Among animals, more tasks are recommended to address limitations in
   current biological information, to address major threats to the species,
   and to enhance public relations than is the case for plants. Finally,
   similar to30\% of species for which the current recovery plan is older
   than 1990 are increasing in abundance, a marked improvement over those
   species for which the recovery plan was only recently written. These
   data suggest that the process of listing species and writing recovery
   plans is working. In addition, animal populations are more often
   increasing in abundance than plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Recovery efforts for threatened and endangered species often must be
   initiated with incomplete data. The outcomes of such efforts are
   difficult to predict, which makes monitoring the progress of recovery
   efforts an integral part of the recovery process. We evaluated the role
   of monitoring in recovery plans for 181 species listed as threatened and
   endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We considered both the
   extent to which monitoring tasks were proposed as part of the recovery
   effort and the extent to which the tasks proposed were actually
   implemented. In general, tasks devoted to tracking the species'
   population trend were more likely to be proposed and implemented than
   were other monitoring activities (e.g., those devoted to the species'
   demographic, its habitat requirements, or the impact of predators,
   competitors, and exotics). We found that the extent and nature of the
   monitoring proposed and implemented appeared to reflect taxonomic biases
   that exist throughout the recovery process and were little influenced
   either by the level of understanding of the species' biology or by the
   recovery priority assigned to the species. In particular, monitoring
   efforts did not adequately address the specific threats affecting
   species. Proposals for, and implementation of, monitoring progress
   toward recovery goals were independent of the type of criteria defined
   in the plans (e.g., population level and habitat extent), although
   population-related criteria were disproportionately common. Based on
   these findings, we caution against an overemphasis on focal species
   monitoring, especially when such an emphasis leads to the reduction or
   exclusion of other types of monitoring. We also recommend that
   species-specific attributes factor more prominently in the development
   of monitoring to avoid monitoring action that is otherwise unnecessary.}},

Abstract = {{Using the results of a survey of recovery plans for threatened and
   endangered species, we evaluated the role that Population Viability
   Analysis (PVA) has played in recovery planning and management of rare
   species in the United States. Although there was a significant increase
   over time in the percentage of plans presenting information on PVA and
   assigning recovery tasks to collect more such information, the use of
   PVA was still called for in less than half of the plans approved since
   1991. Because scarcity of data for rare species may be limiting the
   application of PVA to endangered species, we also assessed how often
   recovery plans proposed to collect the full complement of data required
   to perform four general types of PVA. For most of the species in the
   database, proposed monitoring data would allow the simplest type of PVA
   method (i.e., analysis of total population counts) to be applied, but

Abstract = {{The European eel panmicitic population has been declining at least since
   the 1980s throughout its distribution area. The stocks are now ten times
   lower than they were initially. The causes of this decline are reviewed
   in this paper: marine causes such as Gulf Stream shifts are thought to
   reduce survival of leptocephali larvae during their transoceanic
   migration, but inland causes are also suspected, i.e. overfishing of all
   continental stages, obstructions to upstream and downstream migrations,
   habitat loss, water quality, parasite and xenobiotic contamination,
   which together contribute to reducing quality and quantity of spawner
   escapement from European inland waters to sea. Restoration programs have
   been conducted in several inland hydrosystems in Europe. If local
   fisheries have been sustained mainly by stocking elvers and glass eels,
   no significant restoration of the population has been observed
   suggesting that restoration plans are inefficient, despite significant
   efforts and relevant technologies (fish passage). The causes for the
   failure of restoration projects are listed and discussed, and it is
   shown that the minimum scale to work at is the catchment area. But
   international cooperation is required to coordinate programs, to
   determine common objectives and policies. Concepts for Sustainable
   restoration and management are provided and discussed together with the
   general interest of eel population as a biointegrator of the quality and
   integrity of inland hydrosystems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{1. Nectar flower abundance was manipulated through flower removal, and
   sex ratio was manipulated by moving individual butterflies within a
   series of nine alpine meadows. The movement and abundance of the
   butterfly Parnassius smintheus in the meadows were monitored using
   mark-release-recapture methods.
   2. A total of 937 butterflies, 698 males and 239 females, was captured.
   There were 223 observed between-meadow movements. Fifty-two per cent of
   males and 35\% of females moved among meadows.
   3. The immigration of male butterflies was related positively to nectar
   flowers, host plant abundance, and female butterflies. Male emigration
   was not affected by any of the treatments. The number of males captured
   was related positively to nectar flowers and host plants but not
   affected by sex ratio. The number of resident male butterflies was
   greater in meadows containing flowers and was related positively to host
   plant abundance, but unaffected by sex ratio.
   4. Flower removal, sex ratio, and abundance of Sedum had no significant
   effect on the abundance, movement, or residence time for female
   butterflies, in part due to small sample size.
   5. The fact that males immigrate to higher quality meadows suggests that
   male butterflies are assessing meadow quality, either by sampling
   meadows or potentially from a distance using olfactory cues.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate synchronized annual fluctuation of seed production and
   its advantage for regeneration at the community level, for nine years
   (1987-1995) we monitored the flowering, seed production, and seedling
   emergence of the 16 principal tree species in a temperate deciduous
   forest, Ogawa Forest Reserve, in central Japan.
   We found that the species with higher synchronized flowering within a
   population had larger fluctuation of annual seed production at the
   population level. The coefficient of concordance of flowering and the
   coefficient of variation of annual seed production were continuously
   distributed among species, making it difficult to distinguish masting
   from nonmasting species. The annual seed production patterns of the 16
   species were classified, by cluster analysis, into groups that
   synchronize their fluctuation of annual seed production. This analysis
   showed a highly synchronized annual seed production, not only among
   congeneric species, but also among species of different families.
   Although our results have some insufficiency of statistical
   significance, they did show that predator satiation, both in a
   population and a guild, effectively operated for many species to enhance
   seed survival at the pre-dispersal stage. They also showed that
   pollination efficiency was likely to be operating at the population
   level for half of the wind-pollinating species. However, generalist
   predator satiation at the postdispersal seed stage may not operate in a
   simple, detectable manner in this species-rich forest community.
   It is highly probable that there are combined effects of several
   factors: limited weather triggers for flowering, common flowering
   physiology among taxonomically related species, and the ecological
   advantages at the population and guild levels, may cause multiple
   species to have synchronized fluctuation patterns of seed production.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesize that foraging stream salmonids move during summer because
   (1) they monitor habitat conditions at a reach scale (100s of m), and
   (2) dominant fish move when conditions in their present foraging
   location become sub-optimal relative to conditions at other locations in
   the reach. To test these ideas, we quantified temporal variation in
   foraging habitat quality between late spring and early fall in a reach
   of a small Rocky Mountain brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, stream,
   predicted optimal-foraging fish distributions within the reach, and
   experimentally manipulated access to foraging sites and measured fish
   responses. Our results show that high-quality foraging sites were
   located at certain places in the reach during one period, but at
   different places during others, consistent with the hypothesis that fish
   movement is required if dominant fish are to occupy high-quality
   foraging sites throughout summer. The optimal foraging model was able to
   predict foraging locations within study pools, but not the exact
   location of individual fish within the pools or the reach. However,
   empirical evidence suggests that fish were distributed in order to
   maximize energy intake at the reach scale. Finally, dominant fish
   excluded from their preferred foraging location either left the pools
   (three of six cases), or began to occupy focal points of the next
   largest fish which, in turn, exited the pool (two of six cases). If
   habitat selection was occurring only within habitat units, then large
   fish, when excluded from their preferred locations, would select the
   next best locations within the pool. Taken together, these results
   suggest that charr use summertime movements to both monitor habitat
   conditions at a large spatial scale, and to gain access to optimal
   foraging locations even as conditions change temporally.}},

   are open ecosystems, with steep environmental gradients. Their
   accessibility to man has rendered them susceptible to a variety of

   they are more amenable to management than open ocean habitats. This
   review uses examples from throughout the world to demonstrate the extent
   to which rocky shores have been, and are currently, affected by
   pollution (examples used are endocrine disrupters, oil, eutrophication),
   over-collection of living resources, introduced alien species,
   modification of coastal processes (coastal defences, siltation) and
   global change (climate, sea level). These impacts are put into the
   context of natural fluctuations in time and variability in space of both
   the environment and the organisms. The relative magnitudes of some
   anthropogenic disturbances differ between the industrialized, developed
   world and the developing world. For example, in developed,
   industrialized countries pollution based impacts should diminish over
   the next 25 years due to improved regulation and a reduction in older
   `dirtier' heavy industry. Conversely, in many developing countries
   pollution will increase as a consequence of growth in the human
   population and industrialization. Except for large-scale disasters such
   as oil spills, pollution tends mainly to influence embayed coastlines.
   Chronic effects such as eutrophication can have broader-scale impacts
   over whole coastlines and elevated nutrient levels have also been
   implicated in a trend of increasing frequency of catastrophic kills due
   to harmful algal. Direct removal of living resources has had major
   effects on coastlines at both local and regional scales and is likely to
   increase over the next 25 years, especially in developing countries
   where rapidly expanding human populations will put further pressure on
   resources. Impacts from recreational activities are likely to increase
   with greater leisure time in wealthier regions of the world, and cheaper
   travel will spread these impacts to poorer regions. Invasions by alien
   species have increased in frequency during the last 20 years leading to
   some dramatic effects on native assemblages. Problems associated with
   alien species, especially pathogens, will continue to increase over the
   next few decades. The proportion of the coastline modified by artificial
   structures (breakwaters, seawalls, groynes) will increase because of
   coastal development and defences against sea-level rise and the greater
   frequency of storms. This will increase connectivity between areas of
   rocky habitat. Siltation will continue to increase due to urbanization
   of catchments and estuaries, and changes in agricultural practice. This
   may have considerable impacts at local and regional scales, favouring
   sediment tolerant organisms such as turf algae and anemones. In the
   future, greater frequency of environmental extremes is likely, including
   large-scale events such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
   Global change in temperature, sea-level rise and increases in the
   frequency of storms will affect rocky shores throughout the world, but
   this will occur over long time scales; over the next 25 years most of
   the responses by rocky shore communities will mostly be quite subtle.
   Thus rocky shores will be subject to increasing degradation over the
   next 25 years. They are, however, less vulnerable than many other
   aquatic habitats due to their hard substratum (rock), their relative
   lack of large biogenic structures and to their generally open nature.
   They are also remarkably resilient, and rec
   Their susceptibility to both terrestrial and marine disturbances does
   make them more vulnerable than sublittoral and offshore habitats. There
   are considerable gaps in knowledge, particularly of certain
   microhabitats such as crevices, boulders, sand-scoured areas and rock
   pools. These have been much less studied than more accessible
   assemblages on open, freely draining rock. More research is needed to
   establish the effects of increasing sediment loads, ultraviolet
   radiation and introduced species on rocky shore communities. Strategic
   and applied research programmes should integrate field experiments and
   carefully selected monitoring programmes to verify management regimes.
   Hindcasting from the palaeo-record would be valuable, to compare rates
   of predicted change with periods when change was rapid in the past. This
   information could, in principle, be used to help conserve rocky shores
   through networks of marine protected areas and a general reduction of
   environmental pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Thrips are important pests of dendrobium orchid flowers in Hawaii
   primarily because of the risk that exported flowers found to be infested
   will be rejected by quarantine inspectors. Using nondestructive
   sampling, the population dynamics of thrips infesting dendrobium orchids
   was monitored at two farms on the Island of Hawaii over a period of 1
   yr. Average thrips populations varied between 0 and 1.0 thrips per spray
   (flower spike). At both sites, adult thrips almost always outnumbered
   nymphs. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis
   (Pergande), was the predominant species found. Using randomization
   tests, adult thrips were found to be randomly distributed on orchid
   sprays. The binomial probability distribution was used to graphically
   describe the accuracy of scouting results as a function of sample size
   and the proportion of thrips-infested flowers. Efficient methods for
   counting adult thrips included nondestructive field counts (direct
   observation), flower shakes, and extractions via Berlese funnels.}},

Abstract = {{Research on environmentally related chemical contaminants in breast milk
   spans several decades and dozens of countries. The ability to use this
   research as an environmental indicator is limited because of a lack of
   consistent protocols. Data on xenobiotics in breast milk are influenced
   by choices in sample selection, sample pooling, analysis, and reporting.
   In addition, most studies have focused only on a small panel of
   persistent organic pollutants, despite indications that a wide range of
   additional chemical contaminants may also enter breast milk. Despite
   these limitations, however, it is possible to draw some generalizations.
   In this paper we review available data on levels of organochlorine
   pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated
   dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), metals,
   and solvents in breast milk. Examples drawn from around the world
   illustrate the available data and the patterns that have appeared in
   various areas over time. Over the past few decades, levels of the
   organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, and dioxins have declined in breast
   milk in countries where these chemicals have been banned or otherwise
   regulated. In contrast, the levels of PBDEs are rising. Regional
   differences in levels of xenobiotics in breast milk are related to
   historical and current local use patterns. Diet is a major factor that
   influences breast milk levels of persistent organic pollutants, with
   patterns in fish consumption playing a particularly significant role.
   Improved global breast milk monitoring programs would allow for more
   consistent data on trends over time, detection of new xenobiotics in
   breast milk, and identification of disproportionately exposed
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an index of similarity that has application in
   monitoring relative changes of complex microbial communities for the
   purpose of understanding the impact of community instability in
   biological wastewater treatment systems. Gas chromatographic data
   quantifying microbial fatty acid esters extracted from biosolids samples
   can be used to infer the occurrence of changes in mixed culture
   community structure. One approach to rapidly assess the relative
   dissimilarity between samples is to calculate a similarity index scaled
   between 0 and 1. The many arbitrary scales that are associated with the
   available calculation methods for similarity indices limits the extent
   of application. Therefore, a specialized index of similarity was derived
   from consideration of the measurement errors associated with the
   chromatographic data. The resultant calculation method provides a clear
   mechanism for calibrating the sensitivity of the similarity index, such
   that inherent measurement variability is accommodated and
   standardization of scaling is achieved. The similarity index sensitivity
   was calibrated with respect to an effective gas chromatographic peak
   coefficient of variation, and this calibration was particularly
   important for facilitating comparisons made between different systems or
   experiments. The proposed index of similarity was tested with data
   acquired from a recently completed study of contaminant removal from
   pulp mill wastewater. The results suggest that this index can be used as
   a screening tool to rapidly process microbial fatty acid (MFA)
   compositional data, with the objective of making preliminary
   identification of underlying trends in (MFA) community structure, over
   time or between experimental conditions. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A population of the invasive mussel Musculista senhousia was monitored
   bimonthly from May 1999 through April 2000 in the Sacca di Goro, a
   brackish lagoon of the Po River Delta, Northern Adriatic Sea, in order
   to give information on the gametogenic cycle, population dynamics, and
   secondary production of this successful invader. The gonad underwent 4
   different stages: spent (December to February), developing (March to
   May), ripe (June to August), and spawning (September to November). The
   population was numerically dominated by a single cohort of individuals
   for most of the year. The mean size of this cohort rapidly increased to
   24-25 mm shell length, after which growth slowed and mussels rarely grew
   larger than 30-32 mm. Summer anoxia may have greatly reduced mussel
   abundance; annual cohort mortality was 95\%. No recruitment was
   registered on the bed until February 2000, and there was a large pulse
   of new recruits in April when two cohorts were clearly recognizable. The
   established bed was the primary site for new recruitment. Secondary
   production, calculated with two different methods, gave comparable
   estimates; P:B ratios were 1.5 and 1.7. M. senhousia beds; seemed to
   facilitate the presence of other macrofaunal taxa: abundance of some
   species (a small gastropod, amphipods, and tube-building polychaetes)
   were significantly higher within mussel mats at two sites sampled in May
   2000 than they were in soft-sediments similar to100 m away.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in populations of fluorescent pseudomonads on wheat roots are
   usually associated with take-all decline, natural control of take-all, a
   disease caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt).
   Colonisation by Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Pf29A was assessed on the
   roots of healthy plants and of plants with take-all, and the effect of
   this bacterium on indigenous populations of fluorescent pseudomonads was
   studied. The efficacy of Pf29A as an agent for the biocontrol of
   take-all on five-week-old wheat seedlings was tested in non-sterile
   conducive soil in a growth chamber. RAPD (random amplification of
   polymorphic DNA) fingerprinting with a decamer primer was used to
   monitor strain Pf29A and culturable indigenous rhizoplane populations of
   fluorescent pseudomonad. Pf29A decreased disease severity and accounted
   for 44.6\% of the culturable fluorescent pseudomonads on healthy plant
   rhizoplane and 75.8\% on diseased plant rhizoplane. Fewer RAPD patterns
   were obtained when Pf29A was introduced into the soil with Ggt. In the
   presence of Ggt and necrotic roots, Pf29A became the dominant root
   coloniser and dramatically changed the diversity and the structure of
   indigenous fluorescent pseudomonad populations. The results show that
   Ggt and reduced lesion size on roots can trigger a specific increase in
   antagonist populations and that the introduction of a biocontrol agent
   in soil influences the structure of indigenous bacterial populations.}},

Abstract = {{To study the correlated evolution of locomotor behavior and exercise
   physiology, we conducted an artificial selection experiment. From the
   outbred Hsd:ICR strain of Mus domesticus, we began eight separate lines,
   each consisting of 10 breeding pairs. In four of the lines, we used
   within-family selection to increase voluntary wheel running. The
   remaining four lines were random-bred (within lines) to serve as
   controls. Various traits have been monitored to test for correlated
   responses. Here, we report on organ masses, with emphasis on the triceps
   surae muscle complex. an important extensor of the ankle. Mice from the
   selected lines exhibit reduced total body mass, increased relative
   (mass-corrected) kidney mass, and reduced relative triceps surae mass.
   In addition, a discrete muscle-mass polymorphism was observed: some
   individuals had triceps surae that were almost 50\% lighter than normal
   for their body mass. This small-muscle phenotype was observed in only
   three of the eight lines: in one control line, it has fluctuated in
   frequency between zero and 10\%, whereas in two of the selected lines it
   has increased in frequency to approximately 50\% by generation 22. Data
   from a set of parents and offspring (generations 23 and 24) are
   consistent with inheritance as a single autosomal recessive allele.
   Evidence for the adaptive significance of the small-muscle allele was
   obtained by fitting multiple-generation data to hierarchical models that
   include effects of genetic drift and/or selection. The small-muscle
   allele is estimated to have been present at low frequency (approximately
   7\%) in the base population, and analysis indicates that strong
   selection favors the allele in the selected but not control lines. We
   hypothesize that the small muscles possess functional characteristics
   and/or that the underlying allele causes pleiotropic effects (e.g.,
   reduced total body mass; increased relative heart, liver, and kidney
   mass) that facilitate high levels of wheel running. Nevertheless, at
   generation 22, wheel running of affected individuals did not differ
   significantly from those with normal-sized muscles, and the magnitude of
   response to selection has been similar in all four selected lines,
   indicating that multiple genetic ``solutions{''} are possible in
   response to selection for high activity levels.}},

Abstract = {{Trolling, a novel trapping method, was developed and tested for deer
   flies, Chrysops spp., and other Tabanidae. The trap is a plastic plant
   container coated with Tanglefoot that is mounted upside down on a rod in
   an apparatus attached to a vehicle. The vehicle is then driven
   ``trolled{''} to attract Tabanidae. Trap movement, color, shape,
   dimension and size were evaluated to improve trap catch. Response by
   Chrysops vittatus Wiedemann/C. pikei Whitney and C. macquarti Philip to
   the trap's parameters are reported. The most effective trap is a 15 cm
   diameter pot (Lerio C-360, B-6, The Lerio Corp. Mobile, AL) painted
   bright blue, placed 1-2 m above the ground and moved at a speed of less
   than 3.13 m/sec. Response of Chrysops spp. to the trap indicated the
   hierarchy of behavioral stimuli to Chrysops spp. in order of importance
   to be height, movement, speed, dimensions, color, size, and contrast. No
   known tabanid attractants tested including CO(2), acetone or octenol
   increased trap captures and the insect repellent, DEET,
   N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, did not reduce trap captures. Other
   biological information derived during the trapping experiments is
   reported. The trolling trap appears very valuable to detect and monitor
   certain Chrysops spp. and other tabanid populations for scientific
   purposes. In addition the trap or modifications of it, mounted either on
   or near humans (hat or walking stick) or on vehicles, may be useful to
   reduce or eliminate attacks from Chrysops spp. or to suppress their
   activity for short time periods in small areas such as dooryards.}},

Abstract = {{1. In this paper we examine the potential of a cichlid fish species
   (Sarotherodon galilaeus ) to both maintain positive growth rates through
   filter-feeding on phytoplankton and improve water quality in Lake
   Kinneret through suppression of dinoflagellate (Peridinium gatunense )
   blooms.
   2. Seasonal plankton consumption by S. galilaeus from Lake Kinneret was
   examined experimentally by monitoring changes in plankton assemblages
   during 24 h in 5-m(3) mesocosms containing varying densities of fish.
   Taxon-specific grazing rates ranged from 0 to 17 mg g(fish) day(-1),
   with mean total consumption of 1.6\% fish body weight per day. During
   the spring bloom of P. gatunense, S. galilaeus consumed mostly (94\%)
   netphytoplankton (greater than or equal to20 mum). The remaining 6\%
   consisted mostly of nanophytoplankton (<20 \&mu;m). During the summer
   and fall, net- and nanophytoplankton accounted for 54 and 42\%,
   respectively, of the diet of S. galilaeus . Zooplankton and flagellated
   and ciliated protozoans made up the remaining 4\%.
   3. Simulations using a fish bioenergetics model indicated that
   consumption rates (C) were near maximum in spring (90\%C-max), while
   consumption was reduced in summer-fall (59\%C-max). Sarotherodon
   galilaeus obtains sufficient energy through filter-feeding year-round,
   although most growth (\&GE;60\%) occurs during the spring P. gatunense
   bloom.
   4. Despite efficient feeding on P. gatunense and nanophytoplankton by S.
   galilaeus , estimates of instantaneous plankton mortality caused by
   ingestion were two orders of magnitude lower than maximum potential
   plankton growth rates. Thus the potential for the S. galilaeus
   population in Lake Kinneret to positively affect water quality through
   algal suppression is low.}},

Abstract = {{Regular water-quality monitoring is yielding a great number of
   hydrographical and chemical data regarding the brackish Baltic Sea.
   However, present monitoring programmes often do not include shallow and
   sheltered near-shore areas, which are adjacent to human population and
   used for recreation purposes. We collected new near-shore water quality
   data from the southern coast of Finland that will allow the definition
   of the present state of these systems and may serve as reference data
   for possible future monitoring programmes. The data set comprises 45
   small and shallow embayments with a mean surface area of 211 ha and a
   mean depth of 4.3 m. According to redundancy analysis (RDA), catchment
   land use explained 20.3\% of the variance in the measured water
   chemistry. Agriculture had the strongest influence on the water quality
   of the study sites, capturing 13.1\% of the variance. Nitrogen seemed to
   be strongly related to agriculture, whereas phosphorus was correlated
   with urban areas and industry. Higher than average nutrient
   concentrations regularly occurred at the mouths of large rivers, or
   close to human settlement, emphasising the significance of local sources
   to the nutrient concentrations of coastal waters. No increasing trend in
   nutrient or chlorophyll-a concentrations was observed from west to east
   in these shallow and sheltered nearshore areas. This contrasts with
   earlier results from pelagic samplings that report a marked influence of
   the River Neva and St. Petersburg on the nutrient status of the Gulf of
   Finland. Because these shallow embayments are strongly influenced by the
   local nutrient load, continued measures must be undertaken to reduce the
   nutrient load from land to prevent the continued deterioration and
   eutrophication of the nearshore, coastal waters.}},

Abstract = {{The elephant in Sri Lanka, with a population estimated to be about 4,000
   today, is threatened by the loss of its jungle habitat due to human
   activity centred around the development programmes of the country. The
   wild elephant population is fragmented, and restricted to a few isolated
   small habitats in protected areas. The maintenance of a high degree of
   genetic diversity within elephant subpopulations is vital for its
   long-term survival. Monitoring the degree of genetic heterogeneity in
   the geographical subpopulations of elephant is therefore an essential
   pre-requisite for this purpose. Although the maternal lineage of the
   elephant population in Sri Lanka has been examined previously, nuclear
   DNA has not been examined to gather complementary information. The aim
   of this study was to develop the methodology to obtain nuclear DNA
   fingerprints of the elephant with the multilocus human DNA probe 33.15
   (Jeffreys), and to evaluate the probe to study the degree of genetic
   heterogeneity in the elephant population. An unique DNA fingerprint was
   obtained for each elephant DNA sample under the optimized conditions of
   hybridization (61degreesC in buffer containing 0.25 M sodium phosphate,
   7\% SDS, 1\% BSA, 6\% PEG, 10 mM EDTA and 0.25\% dried milk, 100 ng/15
   ml probe) developed during the study. A pair-wise comparison of DNA
   banding patterns of 8 individuals in the 3-23 kb region revealed a mean
   band sharing coefficient of 0.307 + 0.085. A total of 57 variable
   banding positions were observed and the mean number of bands per
   individual was 19 +/- 2.14. The calculated heterozygosity values for the
   unrelated and related individuals were 0.73, and 0.57 (mean)
   respectively. The study clearly demonstrated that the 33.15 probe is
   highly suitable to monitor the degree of genetic heterogeneity in the
   geographical subpopulations of the Asian elephant.}},

   moth, Dendrolimus pini , the nun moth, Lymantria monacha , the pine

   Neodiprion sertifer was evaluated. The catch from traps baited with the

   baited with pheromones for several species. The catch in the
   multispecies traps was significantly reduced in comparison with the
   single species traps for Dendrolimus pini , L. monacha and N. sertifer .
   Neodiprion sertifer was most likely inhibited by the Diprion pini
   pheromone. A follow-up study of Dendrolimus pini and L. monacha showed
   no pheromonal interference between them. Further studies are needed to
   evaluate the feasibility of multispecies monitoring. However, for
   practical applications a slight decrease in catch, due to pheromonal
   interference, could probably be tolerated as long as the catch reflects
   total population density.}},

Abstract = {{1 Part of the forest reserve established in Paneveggio Forest (Trento,
   Italy) in 1992 has been allowed to evolve without human intervention.
   Inside this reserve, two 1-ha long-term monitoring plots were
   established in subalpine multi-layered forest stands.
   2 To investigate the origin, spatio-temporal development and disturbance
   history of these plots, the present study combined dendroecological tree
   ring analysis with historical evidence.
   3 One stand (VB3) had an uneven-aged population in which the oldest
   trees were more than 400 years old. Regeneration has been continuous
   both in time and space over the last three centuries, during which time
   the stand has been affected regularly by disturbances. This supports the
   information from historical documents, suggesting that a selection
   system was carried out in this area.
   4 The second stand (BDO) also had an uneven-aged population, with trees
   up to 397 years old. Although this plot too had been affected quite
   regularly by disturbances, massive regeneration occurred only after
   1920, suggesting that the land might previously have been exploited as
   pasture.
   5 Despite their relatively similar structures, the two plots developed
   in entirely different ways. Our study confirmed that biological data can
   be used to identify the occurrence and intensity of prior localized
   disturbances in forest stands, but the precise causes of the
   disturbances can be determined only by comparing biological data and
   historical records.}},

Abstract = {{We compared concurrent trap-net (i.e., modified fyke net) and gill-net
   catches of black bullhead (Ameiurus melas) from 28 South Dakota water
   bodies sampled in 2000 or 2001. The length-frequency distribution of
   sampled black bullheads was significantly different (P = 0.0001) between
   gears, primarily because the trap nets commonly collected bullheads less
   than 150 mm total length, while such fish were collected in low numbers
   by the experimental gill nets. Size structure of stock-length (i.e.,
   greater than or equal to150 mm) black bullheads was similar between
   gears, as evidenced by a correlation of proportional stock density
   values (P = 0.0001) with the y-intercept not different from 0 and the
   slope not different from 1. However, mean catch per unit effort (CPUE)
   of stock-length black bullheads in the two gears was not correlated (P =
   0.10). Mean trap-net CPUE had a broad range (from near 0 to over 2,300
   per net-night), while mean gill-net CPUE did riot exceed 250/net-night,
   perhaps because of net saturation. Thus. both trap nets and experimental
   gill nets provided similar indices of population size structure, but the
   trap nets may provide a better index of relative abundance for black
   bullhead population monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to develop a long-term monitoring program that
   quantified anuran population trends in Rhode Island. Because road-based,
   manual call surveys are widely used in North America to monitor anurans,
   we assessed the efficacy of using this method to monitor the impact of
   anthropogenic change of anuran populations in the state. We quantified
   interspecific variation in calling chronology, calling frequency, and
   calling intensity at 31 breeding ponds in southern Rhode Island in 1998.
   Four distinct sampling periods were needed to monitor the seven species
   we detected. During a species' peak sampling period, males of some
   species called only sporadically within our 16-min surveys, such as
   pickerel frogs (Rana palustris), whereas other species called
   continually {[}spring peepers (Psendacris crucifer) and green frogs
   (Rana clamitans)]. Based on accumulation curves, we suggest that call
   surveys in Rhode Island be conducted for 10-min at breeding ponds to
   have a high probability of detecting all species. Assuming we conduct
   one call survey annually during the four sampling periods, a power
   analysis estimated that we need to conduct 283 or 690 10-min surveys
   annually to detect 10\% or 5\% annual declines, respectively, to monitor
   most anurans in Rhode Island. Common species that are widespread and
   call frequently could be monitored with road-based call surveys.
   However, rarer species or those that call infrequently would be
   difficult to monitor with call surveys in Rhode Island; therefore other
   monitoring methods might be more appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{The raptor population wintering in lowland farmland of northwestern
   Italy vas monitored during the winters of 1998-99 and 1999-2000 by means
   of a roadside vehicle survey. To estimate the density of wintering
   raptors, we recorded perpendicular distances of the birds from transect
   lines. Seven species of rapiers were recorded, but a sufficient number
   of observations to estimate density was collected only for the Common
   Blizzard (Buteo buteo). The extensive rice fields in the eastern part of
   the region and some other restricted areas, rich in humid meadows arid
   scattered woodlots, showed high Common Buzzard densities (1.1-1.6
   birds/km(2)), but the other cultivated areas, mainly cornfields, had a
   significantly lower density (0.2 birds/km(2)). On the basis of these
   data. we estimated a wintering population of Common Buzzards of the
   lowland farmland, covering about 6700 km(2) in the Piemonte region of
   northwestern Italy of 3700 (3200-4400) birds.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored Survival and allele frequencies at five enzyme loci in
   single year-class cohorts of cultured Mytilus spp. during a 14 month
   period from sleeving of seed to harvest at three commercial mussel farms
   in Notre Dame Bay, Newfoundland. Canada. Among-site genetic
   heterogeneity at all five individual loci and over all loci combined was
   evident among the three seed sources. Significant temporal genetic
   heterogeneity occurred at all three sites. The observed intra-site
   temporal heterogeneity was not related to genotypic state since neither
   the relative proportions of homozygotes and heterozygotes at each of the
   five loci individually, nor the mean heterozygosity over five loci,
   changed significantly within sites over time. Significant change in
   genotypic frequencies at the Gpi locus was the primary contributing
   factor to the overall temporal genetic heterogeneity within each of the
   three sites. Significant temporal changes in genotypic frequencies at
   each of the Mpi, Lap, Pgm, and Odh enzyme loci inconsistently appeared
   among the three sites. A significant directional shift in genotypic
   frequencies, consistent across all three sites, gave evidence of
   genotype-dependent survival selection differentially favoring survival
   of Gpi genotypes with electrophoretically slower alleles in comparison
   to genotypes with electrophoretically faster Gpi alleles during
   sub-tidal rope culture of Mytilus spp. populations in Newfoundland. We
   also conclude that temporal genetic heterogeneity is a common occurrence
   it,. suspended rope culture of Newfoundland blue mussel populations and
   is likely a significant contributory factor in the extensive geographic
   genetic population structuring previously reported among mixed M. edulis
   - M. trossulus populations.}},

Abstract = {{This study used analytical flow cytometry (AFC) to monitor the abundance
   of phytoplankton, coccoliths, bacteria and viruses in a transect that
   crossed a high reflectance area in the western English Channel. The high
   reflectance area, observed by satellite, was caused by the demise of an
   Emiliania huxleyi bloom. Water samples were collected from depth
   profiles at four stations, one station Outside and three stations inside
   the high reflectance area. Plots of transect data revealed very obvious
   differences between Station 1, outside, and Stations 2-4, inside the
   high reflectance area. Inside, concentrations of viruses were higher; E.
   huxleyi cells were lower; coccoliths were higher; bacteria were higher
   and virus:bacteria ratio was lower than at Station 1, outside the high
   reflectance area. This data can simply be interpreted as virus-induced
   lysis of E. huxleyi cells in the bloom causing large concentrations of
   coccoliths to detach, resulting in the high reflectance observed by
   satellite imagery. This interpretation was supported by the isolation of
   two viruses, EhV84 and EhV86, from the high reflectance area that lysed
   cultures of E. huxleyi host strain CCMP1516. Basic characterization
   revealed that they were lytic viruses approximately 170 nm -190 nm in
   diameter with an icosahedral symmetry. Taken together, transect and
   isolation data suggest that Viruses were the major contributor to the
   demise of the E. huxleyi population in the high reflectance area. Close
   coupling between microalgae, bacteria and viruses contributed to a large
   organic carbon input. Consequent cycling influenced the succession of an
   E. huxleyi-dominated population to a more characteristic mixed summer
   phytoplankton community.}},

Abstract = {{The northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus is a sexually dimorphic
   carnivorous marsupial found in northern Australia. Despite males
   weighing up to 1120 g, in at least some populations all males die after
   mating. Radio-tracking and live-trapping at a lowland savanna site in
   Kakadu National Park indicated that females occupied home ranges
   averaging 35 ha with intra-sexually exclusive denning areas. There was
   some overlap of foraging ranges when the density was 3-4 females/km(2),
   but no overlap during periods of lower population density (1-2
   females/km(2)). Male home-range size may be similar to females before
   the mating season, but expands during the mating season to > 100 ha to
   overlap extensively with several female ranges and numerous other mate
   ranges. Despite this range overlap, both sexes were solitary. Even
   during the mating period, males denned on average 0.27 km from females
   during the day. During the mating period, each female was visited by at
   least one to four males per night. During this period, the increase in
   scat deposition in prominent positions in the landscape and the
   simultaneous increase in sternal gland activity of the males suggest the
   importance of olfactory communication to advertise the presence and
   sexual status of individuals. Males adopted a roving strategy, regularly
   visiting several widely spaced females in rapid succession, presumably
   to monitor the onset of oestrus. This intense physical effort during the
   mating period is likely to be a major contributor to the physiological
   decline of the males and subsequent die-off after the mating period. The
   marked sexual dimorphism of D. hallucatus may be the result of selection
   for larger, wider-ranging males in a promiscuous mating system and for
   energetically efficient smaller females, as females rear the young
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{The interpretation of the spatial and temporal patterns of variation in
   organochlorine concentrations in marine mammal populations is complex
   because of the lack of wide-scale, long-term surveys. Therefore the
   results from several surveys must be combined and this causes undesired
   heterogeneity due to differences in the sampling and analytical
   techniques used and in the biological characteristics of the individuals
   sampled. Moreover, information is not homogeneously distributed in
   either space or in time. Most research is concentrated in western
   Europe, northern America and certain areas of Asia, while it is
   extremely limited or non-existent in Africa and most regions of the
   southern hemisphere. Marine mammals from the temperate fringe of the
   northern hemisphere, particularly fish-eating species which inhabit the
   mid-latitudes of Europe and North America, show the greatest
   organochlorine loads; noteworthy are the extremely high levels found in
   the Mediterranean Sea and certain locations on the western coasts of the
   United States. Concentrations in the tropical and equatorial fringe of
   the northern hemisphere and throughout the southern hemisphere are low
   or extremely low. The polar regions of both hemispheres showed the
   lowest concentrations of DDTs and PCBs, although levels of HCHs,
   chlordanes and HCB were moderate to high in the cold waters of the North
   Pacific. During recent decades, concentrations have tended to decrease
   in the regions where pollution was initially high but they have
   increased in regions located far from the pollution source as a
   consequence of atmospheric transport and redistribution. It is expected
   that the Arctic and, to a lesser extent, the Antarctic, will become
   major sinks for organochlorines in the future; this process may already
   be significant for some compounds such as HCB and HCHs. Effort should be
   devoted to both assessment of organochlorine trends in the now, highly
   polluted Populations of the temperate fringe of the northern hemisphere
   and to the implementation of long-term monitoring of marine mammal
   populations inhabiting polar regions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The seasonal changes in the distribution of Glossina morsitans morsitans
   Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) and its main host, cattle, were examined
   in a cultivated area of the plateau of eastern Zambia. During four
   consecutive years, the tsetse and cattle populations were monitored
   along a fly-round transect traversing the two main vegetation types in
   the study area. These were miombo, a one-storied open woodland with the
   genera Brachystegia and Julbernardia dominant, and munga, a one- or
   two-storied woodland where the principal tree genera were Acacia,
   Combretum and Terminalia. Concurrently, a capture/mark/release/recapture
   (CMRR) exercise was conducted along two other transects also traversing
   both vegetation types. The index of apparent abundance of tsetse (IAA)
   in miombo increased at the beginning of the rainy season (November),
   reached its peak at the end of the rainy season (April) and was low
   during the cold season (May to late August), but especially the hot dry
   season (September to late October). The IAA of tsetse in munga showed a
   pattern that was the reverse of that in miombo. The seasonal changes in
   the IAA of tsetse in both vegetation types were in accordance with
   changes in the movement patterns of tsetse between the two vegetation
   type as observed using CMRR. The distribution and abundance of cattle
   along the transect also showed a seasonal trend. This was especially so
   in munga, during the first three years of observations, where cattle
   abundance increased gradually from June onwards, reached a maximum at
   the end of the hot dry season (October-November) and declined steeply at
   the start of the rainy season (November-December). In both vegetation
   types, the monthly mean IAA of tsetse was positively correlated with the
   abundance of cattle in the previous month. It is concluded that the
   distribution of tsetse in cultivated area of the eastern plateau of
   Zambia undergoes substantial seasonal changes, which can partly be
   attributed to changes in the distribution of cattle. The implications of
   these observations for the control of tsetse are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There is a long tradition of artificially stocking lakes and rivers with
   fish in the hope to increase the quality and amount of fish that can be
   harvested. The animals used for stocking often originate in distant
   hatcheries or hatcheries that breed fish from remote regions. This
   stocking practice could have effects on the genetic integrity of
   resident populations. We have analysed here a case of the influence of
   stocking on Alpine populations of the Arctic charr (usually included
   into Salvelinus alpinus, but revised to Salvelinus umbla Kottelat 1997)
   within a unique geographical and historical setting. The Konigssee in
   the Bavarian Alps (Berchtesgaden) was heavily stocked several times
   during the last century. However, a sample of the ancestral Konigssee
   population still exists in the Grunsee, which lies close to Konigssee,
   but 1000 m higher. To trace the influence of stocking in Konigssee we
   have analysed more than 300 individuals from 10 lake populations,
   including the source populations of the fish used for stocking. From
   these we have sequenced a part of the mitochodrial control region and
   have typed them at six microsatellite loci. The differential
   distribution of haplotypes, as well as assignment tests, show that the
   influence of stocking on the genetic integrity of the Konigssee
   population has been negligible. However, our data reveal that in another
   lake included in our study (Starnberger See), the ancestral population
   was apparently replaced completely by the populations used for stocking.
   The major difference between the lakes is the relative preservation of
   ecological integrity. Konigssee was ecologically stable in the past,
   whereas Starnberger See was heavily polluted at one point, with charr
   approaching extinction. Interestingly, in a lake neighbouring
   Starnberger See, the Ammersee, which was also subject to strong
   pollution but not stocked, the ancestral population has recovered. Our
   data suggest that the practice of artificial stocking should be
   reconsidered, or at least monitored for effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure of Silurus glanis (Europe's largest freshwater
   fish species) across most of its natural distribution was investigated
   using 10 microsatellite loci. The revealed levels of genetic diversity
   were much higher than previous allozyme and restriction fragment length
   polymorphism mitochondrial DNA analyses had shown; relative levels of
   variability among populations were however, in good agreement with the
   previous studies. Populations from large basins (Volga and Danube
   rivers) were the most polymorphic, while samples from the smaller Greek
   rivers, which are more prone to genetic bottleneck, exhibited the lowest
   levels of genetic diversity. Microsatellite multilocus genotyping
   permitted the assignment of individual fish to their population of
   origin with a score as high as 98.3\%. Despite the great genetic
   differentiation of S. glanis populations, no consistent pattern of
   geographical structuring was revealed,, in contrast to previous studies
   of European freshwater fish species. A model of isolation by distance
   seems more probable and a hypothesis of recent dispersion from only one
   glacial refugium is proposed. The discovery of the highest levels of
   microsatellite and mitochondrial diversity in the Volga sample and the
   presence of river connections, during the Pleistocene, between this area
   and all major areas of the present catfish distribution, place this
   refugium around the Ponto-Caspian region. Combining these data with
   those from previous studies, a number of markers are now available to
   monitor wild and hatchery populations even at the individual level.}},

Abstract = {{Eight polymorphic microsatellite loci have been characterized for the
   endangered St Lucia Whiptail Lizard Cnemidophorus vanzoi. Endemic to two
   small islets, Maria Major and Maria Minor, off the coast of St Lucia,
   Lesser Antilles, the world population is estimated at < 1000
   individuals. However, representatives of the systematically complex
   genus Cnemidophorus, containing sexual species and parthenogenetic
   allopolyploids, are distributed widely in North, Central and South
   America, and on several islands in the Caribbean Sea. These
   microsatellite markers are being used to monitor the genetic structure
   of a population of St Lucia Whiptails, recently founded through

Abstract = {{Metapopulation models predicting the persistence of species on the verge
   of extinction in fragmented landscapes have to include local population
   dynamics. In this paper, we report on a 9-yr study in which a patchy
   population of the bog fritillary was monitored each year, with special
   focus on quantifying demographic parameters. We parameterised various
   constrained linear models (CLM) with capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data
   collected in the field each year and we tested the effects of several
   variables on demographic parameters. Selecting the best CLM, we
   estimated the mean and the variance of (1) individual parameters
   (survival and catchability) and (2) population features (population
   size, sex-ratio and recruitment). Survival was not related to the age of
   the individual but decreased continuously during the flight period,
   which means that lifetime expectancy is conversely related to the delay
   between the moment of the emergence of a given individual as compared to
   the emergence of the first adult in the population. Survival was lower
   in males than in females, as a consequence of male mate-locating
   behaviour. Daily population size fits a parabolic distribution in both
   sexes, males appearing, reaching their abundance peak and dying before
   females. Yearly variation in the sex-ratio is the consequence of the
   between-sex difference in the recruitment curve. Total adult population
   size shows large variations between years. Analysis of the relation
   between growth rate and abundance indicates density dependence, probably
   related to parasitism of the larval stages. Density at the equilibrium
   is about 200 adults/ha.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence that lunar cycles entrain crustacean biological rhythms is
   briefly reviewed, Egg laying and hatching undergo semi-lunar and monthly
   rhythms that appear to depend on endogenous clocks. Lunar cycles can be
   understood in terms of adaptation and life history. Original data are
   presented for Homarus gammarus (L) post larvae (n=150) hatched during
   March 1997 and reared artificially. Their moulting frequency was
   monitored from day 112 (post-hatch) to day 204 (CL = 20mm. 1.5 SD).
   Daily moults (n=253) -recorded individually during July, August and
   September- showed an average duration for the first and the second
   inter-moult interval of about 36.2 and 34 days, respectively. Daily
   moulting frequency distribution showed a trend characterised by peak
   values around the new moon weeks (n=75), and significantly lower values
   around the full moon weeks (n=46). Individually reared berried-lobsters
   hatched eggs within restricted periods in the weeks before and a-round
   new moon and full moon in the absence of any tidal cue. The pattern for
   communally reared female lobsters is more confusing, possibly due to
   inter-individual communication and natural sea temperature affecting the
   rhythm. However, modal and moving average values over 24 years sampling
   period support the presence of a semi-lunar cycle. The cycle is
   maintained under laboratory conditions and in sublittoral populations
   that are not subjected to large tidal excursions. Therefore, the
   circa-lunar rhythm may represent a powerful clock that is retained for
   synchronising events throughout the life history of crustaceans. It
   results in reduced predation risks for hatchlings in dark new moon
   nights and favours dispersal during spring tides due to tidal currents,
   This may enhance mutual protection against cannibalistic habits for
   simultaneously moulting juveniles.}},

Abstract = {{Wild plant species were systematically sampled to characterize
   reproduction of thrips, the vector of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV),
   and natural sources TSWV infection. Thrips populations were monitored on
   28 common perennial, biennial, and annual plant species over two noncrop
   seasons at six field locations across North Carolina. Sonchus asper,
   Stellaria media, and Thraxacum officianale consistently supported the
   largest populations of immature TSWV vector species. The tobacco thrips,
   Frankliniella fusca, was the most abundant TSWV vector species
   collected, comprising over 95\% of vector species in each survey season.
   Perennial plant species (i.e., Plantago rugelii and Taraxacum
   officianale) were often only locally abundant, and many annual species
   (Cerastium vulgatum, Sonchus asper, and Stellaria media) were more
   widely distributed. Perennial species, including P. rugelii and Rumex
   crispus, remained TSWV infected for 2 years in a small-plot field test.
   Where these perennial species are locally abundant, they may serve as
   important and long-lasting TSWV inoculum. sources. In random surveys
   across 12 locations in North Carolina, TSWV infection was documented by
   double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 35 of 72
   (49\%) common perennial (N = 10), biennial (N = 4), and annual (N = 21)
   plant species across 18 plant families. Estimated rates of TSWV
   infection were highest in Cerastium vulgatum (4.2\%), Lactuca scariola
   (1.3\%), Molluga verticillata (4.3\%), Plantago rugelii (3.4\%),
   Ranunculus sardous (3.6\%), Sonchus asper (5.1\%), Stellaria media
   (1.4\%), and Taraxacum officianale (5.8\%). Nine plant species were
   determined to be new host recordings for TSWV infection, including
   Cardamine hirsuta, Eupatorium capillifolium, Geranium carolinianum,
   Gnaphalium purpureum, Linaria canadense, Molluga verticillata,
   Pyrrhopappus carolinianus, Raphanus raphanistrum, and Triodanis
   perfoliata. Our findings document the relative potential of a number of
   common annual, biennial, and perennial plant species to act as important
   reproductive sites for F fusca and as acquisition sources of TSWV for
   spread to susceptible crops.}},

Abstract = {{d'Anjou pear, the main cultivar grown in the Mid-Columbia Region of
   Oregon, is subject to russeting of the fruit surface, resulting in
   reduced quality and value. The role of Aureobasidium pullulans and
   Rhodotorula glutinis in russet of pear fruit was studied. Inoculations
   were done at full bloom in 1998 and 1999 and petal fall in 1999 with a
   log range of concentrations up to 108 CFU/ml. Populations of A.
   pullulans on floral and fruit tissue were monitored during spring 1999
   and 2000 in six orchards with a history of russet. Russet of fruit in
   both studies was evaluated at harvest. In 1998 neither fungus increased
   russet. In 1999, inoculation with two strains of each fungus at 108
   CFU/mI increased russet. Inoculation with 104 or 106 CFU/ml did not
   increase russet in either year. In commercial orchards, there was no
   correlation between fruit russet and the populations of A. pullulans on
   floral and fruit tissue. Populations were less than 10(3) CFU/g of
   tissue. We conclude that A. pullulans and R. glutinis are not major
   contributors to russet of d'Anjou pear fruit in the Mid-Columbia Region.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of Pantoea agglomerans strain E325 for control of fire
   blight of apple was determined in comparative field trials involving
   other bacterial antagonists. Concurrently, the importance of the natural
   dispersal of bacteria as a complicating factor was assessed. Tests were
   performed under two sets of conditions, those that allowed for the
   dispersal of bacteria via honeybee activity and those that minimized it
   through the use of translucent polyethylene enclosures around single
   trees. The enclosures also raised daytime temperatures and allowed for
   controlled wetting, two factors important to the development of blossom
   blight. Single-antagonist treatments with strain E325, Pseudomonas
   fluorescens strain A506, and R agglomerans strain C9-1 were applied to
   open blossoms on each of 10 enclosed trees and 10 nonenclosed trees.
   During bloom, suspensions of antagonists (10(8) CFU/ml) were applied
   twice with a brush, and a suspension of Erwinia amylovora (10(7) CFU/ml)
   was subsequently applied once using the same method. Two days after
   inoculation with the pathogen, trees were misted to simulate
   precipitation. Flower-to-flower spread of antagonistic bacteria was less
   frequent on trees surrounded by plastic enclosures than on nonenclosed
   trees. The range and statistical separation of means for population size
   of E. amylovora and disease incidence among treatments were greater for
   enclosed trees than for nonenclosed trees. Based on these results, the
   natural spread of antagonists being compared may mask differences in
   their efficacy as biocontrol agents. Such distortions and resulting
   misinterpretations could be lessened by separating treatments widely in
   large orchard blocks and by monitoring microbial populations. Strain
   E325 from fresh or lyophilized cultures was consistently more effective
   than standard antagonists in suppressing E. amylovora and reducing
   disease incidence, To fully assess its potential use for fire blight,
   larger-scale trials under various conditions will be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The population of sequence variants of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV)
   isolates of different geographic origins and pathogenicity properties
   was characterized by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
   analysis of cDNA of the genes p 18, p 13, p20 and p23. The mild isolates
   analysed here usually yielded a SSCP profile with two DNA bands,
   suggestive of a predominant sequence variant, whereas the SSCP profile
   of the most virulent isolates contained more than two DNA bands,
   indicating that their viral populations are likely to be more complex.
   The set of SSCP profiles of the four genes allowed identification of
   individual isolates, but no profile characteristic of a geographic area
   or a biogroup was found. Sweet orange plants singly inoculated with a
   mild or with a severe isolate yielded the SSCP profile characteristic of
   each isolate, whereas the SSCP profile of plants successively inoculated
   with both isolates was a composite of the two individual profiles. The
   SSCP profile of plants singly inoculated remained constant, but the
   profile of doubly inoculated plants varied with time. Plants in which
   the SSCP profile of the severe isolate became predominant showed stem
   pitting, and those in which the predominant profile corresponded to the
   mild isolate remained symptomless. The results indicate that SSCP
   analysis can be used to study changes in RNA populations of doubly
   inoculated plants and to monitor cross-protection between mild and
   severe isolates.}},

Abstract = {{Instream limestone sand application is used at many sites in
   Pennsylvania to neutralize acidic stream water resulting from acid
   deposition. However, questions remain about the effectiveness of
   limestone sand in the treatment of acid waters, such as reduced contact
   time at high flow, remobilization of aluminum, and adverse effects on
   macroinvertebrates. A 1-year evaluation of limestone sand application to
   Bear Run, an acidic stream in southwestern Pennsylvania, was begun in
   1999. Another nearby acid stream, Linn Run, served as a control. Water
   quality during baseflow and episodic acidification events, along with
   fish and macroinvertebrates, were monitored to evaluate impacts of the
   sand application. Hydrogen ion (H (+) ) concentration and total
   dissolved aluminum (TDA) were significantly reduced, and acid
   neutralizing capacity was significantly increased downstream of the
   limestone sand application compared with the upstream site on Bear Run.
   These parameters at the downstream sites were also different
   (proportional toless than or equal to 0.10) from the comparable sites on
   the control stream. TDA and hydrogen ion concentrations were
   significantly decreased (proportional toless than or equal to 0.10)
   compared with concentrations before the sand application to Bear Run but
   not on the control stream. No fish were present upstream of the sand
   application site, and only a few fish were found downstream at the mouth
   of Bear Run. Standing crop, number of taxa, and Shannon-Weaver diversity
   index values indicated that macroinvertebrate populations were
   negatively impacted 300 m downstream from the sand application and
   improved at the site 1,600 m downstream. Although water quality was
   improved on Bear Run, benefits to macroinvertebrates depended on
   downstream location, and fish populations did not show improvement.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid multiplex PCR (m-PCR) method that allows the simultaneous
   detection. in a single tube, of six commonly encountered waterborne
   pathogens is developed. The target genes used were: the aerolysin (aero)
   gene of Aeromonas hydrophila, the invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene
   of Shigella flexneri, the attachment invasion locus (ail) gene of
   Yersinia enterocolitca, the invasion plasmid antigen B (ipaB) gene of
   Salmonella typhimurium. the enterotoxin extracellular secretion protein
   (epsM) gene of Vibrio cholerae and a species-specific region of the
   16S-23S rDNA (Vpara) gene of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were used as the
   gene targets. Multiplex PCR using the six pairs of primers produced
   specific amplicons of the expected sizes from mixed populations of
   reference bacterial strains in seawater and from pure cultures. The
   m-PCR assay was specific and rapid, with a turnaround time of < 12 h.
   The detection limit of the assay for the bacterial targets was estimated
   at 10(0)-10(2) cfu. Multiplex PCR analysis was performed on 19 seawater
   samples collected around Hong Kong and the results indicated significant
   levels of four bacterial pathogens at several sites where primary sewage
   wastes are discharged, and the levels of which showed no correlation
   with E. coli counts. Overall, both laboratory and field validation
   results demonstrated that the m-PCR assay developed in this study could
   provide a cost-effective and informative supplement to conventional
   microbiological methods for routine monitoring and risk assessment of
   water quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Trends in waterbird numbers in the southern Rift Valley of Kenya,
   1991-2000}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Coordinated waterbird counts have been carried out in major Kenyan
   wetlands annually over the last decade. The lakes of Naivasha,
   Elmenteita, Nakuru (counted since 1991) and Bogoria are close to each
   other in the southern Rift Valley and hold the bulk of both resident and
   migrant waterbirds counted each year. Levels of the four lakes fluctuate
   substantially and all but Naivasha are saline. By contrast, Dandora
   Ponds near Nairobi is a site with stable water levels. We compared
   trends in numbers of birds, categorized by family and by migratory
   status, with an earlier analysis in 1996 and between tire fluctuating
   Rift Valley lakes and Dandora Ponds. Flamingo numbers remained highly
   variable at all sites, showing no long-term trends. In 1996, significant
   declines were found in many piscivorous waterbird groups, including
   grebes, pelicans, cormorants, storks, terns and gulls, mainly associated
   with falling lake levels at Lake Nakuru; by 2000, numbers had recovered.
   Consistent declines in rallids, birds of prey and kingfishers were
   evident in 1996, mainly due to falling numbers at Lake Naivasha. By
   2000, kingfisher numbers had fully, and raptor numbers had partially,
   recovered. Rallids, mainly Red-knobbed Coot (Fulica cristata), continued
   to decline sharply through 1998, but recovered slightly to 1996 levels
   by 2000. After notably high numbers in 19961999, Palaearctic ducks
   declined dramatically in 2000 to a ten-year low. With the exception of
   rallids, none of the groups that had declined from 1991-1996 showed any
   trend in numbers over the extended time period. At Dandora, numbers of
   most waterbird groups fluctuated substantially despite constant
   conditions. The fluctuations showed little synchrony with between
   species or with those at the southern Rift Valley lakes, suggesting
   waterbirds were responding to the availability of suitable wetlands over
   a large area. The declines from 1991-1996 in the southern Rift Valley
   were temporary; recoveries in waterbird numbers were not attributable to
   improved environmental management (human pressures on these wetlands
   intensified front 1997-2000), but to higher lake levels in 1997/98. The
   ten-year data set covers it full cycle of low and high lake levels,
   which the six-year dataset did not, and may now form an adequate
   baseline for monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain baseline density data for population modeling and
   zone-specific management of deer (Odocoileus spp.), we monitored 34
   radiocollared white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) in and around Myles
   Standish State Forest, southeastern Massachusetts, during winters
   1997-2000. Our objectives were to 1) identify factors influencing the
   precision of aerial population estimates; 2) estimate cause-specific
   mortality rates of adults; 3) use population estimates, mortality rates,
   and other reasonable assumptions to calculate an average harvest; and 4)
   compare this estimate with state-reported harvest to assess the accuracy
   of our density and survival data. Two to 5 mark-resight helicopter
   surveys completed in each of 3 successive winters resulted in density
   estimates ranging from 4.7-6.5 deer/km(2) ((x) over bar =5.7
   deer/km(2)). The low proportion of marked individuals in our survey
   areas (annual (x) over bar =8-10\%) was due to poor capture success,
   while low observability (annual (x) over bar =7-15\%) was due to lack of
   snow cover and the preponderance of pine (Pinus spa.) cover. These
   conditions resulted in low-precision estimates ((x) over bar 90\%
   CI=59-222\% of point estimate). Annual survival of 22 adult female deer
   (>1.0 yr old) was 0.87 (95\% CI = 0.79-0.96) versus 0.81 (95\%
   CI=0.68-0.96) for 12 adult males. Sources of female mortality included
   hunting (annual rate=0.05), poaching (0.03), and unknown causes (0.06);
   males were hunted (0.16) and died from unknown causes (0.03). Adult deer
   density and cause-specific mortality data, combined with assumed
   estimates of age ratios (30\% fawns) and adult sex ratios (60\% F) in
   winter, predicted annual legal harvest of 0.14 adult females and 0.30
   adult males/km(2), which approximated the recorded harvest for the
   surrounding management area (0.17 and 0.30, respectively). Despite low
   precision, mean point estimates of deer density and survival could be
   accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Spotlight and road-kill surveys are often used by state agencies and
   managers to monitor raccoon (Procyon lotor) populations. However, the
   ability of these techniques to accurately reflect population abundance
   has not been evaluated. I compared spotlight counts and road-kill
   indices to patterns of abundance as estimated from mark-recapture data
   for 3 raccoon populations in northeastern Illinois. In general,
   spotlight and road-kill indices reflected inter-population differences
   in density. However, there were differences between spotlight and
   live-trapping data for 2 high-density populations. Both survey
   techniques were strongly (rgreater than or equal to0.85) correlated with
   annual trends in capture rates for 2 of 3 populations, and a similar
   pattern occurred with density estimates. Both survey techniques detected
   a manipulated reduction of 50\% in abundance for 1 population. Spotlight
   and road-kill surveys are useful techniques for monitoring changes in
   local populations of raccoons, but they must be used with caution when
   comparing indices among populations with different habitat
   characteristics or when evaluating low-density populations.}},

Abstract = {{Swift foxes (Vulpes velox) were historically distributed across the
   shortgrass and mixed-grass prairie regions of North America. Today, the
   swift fox is found in small, isolated populations in the southern and
   western margins of its historic range. Although methods for censusing
   wild canids exist, an evaluation of survey techniques for monitoring
   trends in the abundance of swift foxes has not been conducted. We
   conducted a 2-year study evaluating 6 survey methods and their ability
   to accurately monitor changes in swift fox density (independently
   determined from radiocollared foxes). The study was conducted on the
   United States Army Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, southeastern Colorado,
   from January 1997 to December 1998. We evaluated catch-per-unit-effort
   (trapping surveys), mark-recapture estimates, scent-post surveys,
   spotlight counts, scat deposition rate surveys, and an activity index.
   All surveys were conducted along 5 10-km transects during 3 seasons
   annually. All methods, except spotlight counts, were reliable and
   consistent for detecting swift fox presence across the 5 survey
   transects. Regression analyses indicated that the correlation between
   swift fox density and survey method varied among methods and seasons,
   with mark-recapture estimates being the highest predictor (r=0.711),
   followed by scat deposition surveys (r=0.697), scent-post surveys
   (r=0.608), spotlight surveys (r=0.420), trapping surveys (r=0.326), and
   the activity index (r=0.067). Stepwise regression analysis of all survey
   methods indicated that the combination of mark-recapture estimates and
   scent-station indices was the highest predictor of swift fox density
   (r=0.853). The combination of these 2 surveys would be economical and
   reliable for monitoring swift fox population trends. The combination of
   scent-station indices and scat deposition surveys was almost as reliable
   (r=0.829) but was far less costly than surveys involving mark-recapture
   estimates. A combination of more surveys did little to increase the
   level of prediction. Survey costs varied due to differing requirements
   of labor and equipment.}},

Abstract = {{in California, care of wildlife injured in oil spills has been
   legislatively mandated and has resulted in development of professionally
   supervised rehabilitation efforts. However, the efficacy and success of
   these programs need evaluation. We assessed survivorship and behavior of
   radio-marked western gulls (Larus occidentalis) that were rehabilitated
   via California's Oiled Wildlife Care Network (OWCN) following the 1997
   Torch/Platform Irene Pipeline spill in south-central California. The
   test groups were 1) oiled and rehabilitated gulls (n=7), 2) non-oiled
   but rehabilitated gulls (n=10), and 3) non-oiled and not rehabilitated
   gulls (n=10). All groups were released to the wild in October 1997 and
   monitored twice weekly by aerial telemetry until January 1998, and once
   weekly thereafter until June 1998. One non-oiled and not rehabilitated
   bird died 115 days after release. All oiled and rehabilitated gulls
   survived until transmitters failed (127-235 days), despite unfavorable
   El Ni (n) over tildeo conditions in early 1998. No statistically
   significant differences could be detected in the size of geographical
   areas used by the three groups of gulls. The results of this study
   suggest that modern rehabilitation programs such as OWCN have the
   potential to reduce impacts to seabird populations from marine oil
   spills by returning some oiled birds back to wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Funding for biological research on feral horse populations is often
   motivated by political debate. Thus, research may start too late to
   contribute substantially to decisions about population monitoring and
   management, or to resolve public debate. Feral horse management problems
   are largely political, economic, and cultural, not biological.
   Consequently, biologists are often employed to address questions
   peripheral to the debate. Politicians, managers, and the public demand
   quick answers, yet the progress of wildlife research is slow. These
   circumstances may provide a challenge for biologists who must juggle
   contractual obligations, public responsibilities, and personal
   publishing goals. We describe our experience researching Kaimanawa feral
   horse behavior and ecology in New Zealand as a case study in coping with
   this dilemma. We suggest that research biologists serve their funding
   body, the public, and colleagues best if they initially relegate the
   apparently more pressing questions arising from public debate or
   stipulated by the research contract by giving priority to basic
   questions of animal behavior, ecology, and population biology. We
   suggest that research funding agencies get better value for their money
   if they design research contracts that allow, researchers the
   flexibility to take this approach. In our study, this approach led to
   important, but unforeseeable, results allowing us to understand
   variation in feral horse biology with direct implications for
   management. We would have missed those opportunities to extend knowledge
   and make conceptual advances if we had just followed the prosaic aims of
   the contracted research. As with all science, advances in understanding
   behavior, ecology, welfare, and management of horses depend on
   researchers looking outside the narrow and short-term perspectives of
   contractual research and public debate.}},

Abstract = {{Vocal individuality is widely suggested as a method for identifying
   individuals within a population. But few studies have explored its
   performance in real or simulated conservation situations. Here we
   simulated the use of vocal individuality to monitor the calling
   corncrake (Crex crex), a secretive and endangered land rail. Our data
   set contained 600 calls from 30 individuals and was used to simulate a
   population of corncrakes being counted and monitored. We tested three
   different neural network models for their ability to discriminate
   between and to identify individuals. Neural networks are nonlinear
   classification tools widely applied to both biological and
   non-biological identification tasks. Backpropagation and probabilistic
   neural networks were used to simulate the reidentification of members of
   a known population (monitoring) and a Kohonen network was used to
   simulate the counting of a population of unknown size (census). We found
   that both backpropagation and probabilistic networks identified all
   individuals correctly all the time, irrespective of sample size. Kohonen
   networks were more variable in performance but estimated population size
   to within one individual of the actual size. Our results indicate that
   neural networks can be used effectively together with recordings of
   vocalizations in census and monitoring tasks.}},

   Zealand farming systems}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL WELFARE}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-170}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A review of the literature was undertaken to consider the possible
   effects of human intervention (shepherding) at around the time of
   parturition in extensively farmed sheep. There is little clear empirical
   evidence to suggest that shepherding ensures either easy, births or the
   integrity of ewe-lamb contact-factors closely, linked to the welfare of
   the animals at this time. There is similarly no clear support for
   shepherding being harmful. However, the following suggestions are made:
   first, human presence can inhibit or delay, parturition; second,
   extended parturition can increase the risk of or is associated with,
   dystocia; and third, disturbance at birth can compromise ewe-lamb
   bonding and consequently lamb survival. Furthermore, sheep populations
   that have undergone rigorous selection for ease of lambing and minimal
   shepherding in extensive environments have well-documented physical and
   behavioural traits underlying their predisposition for enhanced lamb
   survival. Although our cultural legacy may impose a duty to intensively
   monitor animals at lambing, it is concluded that, at least in some
   situations, shepherding may not be entirely beneficial. The commonly
   held view of the necessity, for some human intervention in extensive
   livestock systems is perhaps overly paternalistic, and requires a more
   comprehensive appraisal.}},

Abstract = {{Predation is often considered an important factor in the evolution of
   sociality among animals. We studied mortality patterns and grouping
   behavior of white-nosed coatis (Nasua narica) at sites in southern
   Arizona, USA, and western Jalisco, Mexico. Coatis were monitored by
   radio-tracking and recaptures for more than 3 years at each site. In
   both populations, predation by large felids, including jaguars (Panthera
   onca) and pumas (Plana concolor), accounted for more than 50\% of
   mortality of adult coatis. Predation rates were significantly higher on
   solo coatis than on coatis in groups at both study sites. Predation
   rates were negatively related to group size in Arizona. However,
   mortality of juveniles, as measured by the ratios of juveniles to adult
   females, was not related to the number of adult females per group in
   Arizona or Jalisco. Coatis exhibit a suite of behaviors, including
   foraging with the juveniles in the center of the group, sharing
   vigilance, alarm calling, mobbing and attacking predators, and a highly
   synchronous birth season, that are all consistent with the hypothesis
   that predation has played an important role in shaping coati social
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Many avian brood parasite hosts accept parasitic eggs even though
   successful parasitism frequently is detrimental to their own
   reproduction. Such behaviour seems suboptimal, but has been explained by
   the existence of opposing selective pressures operating against the
   evolution of appropriate host defence. Costs associated with rejection
   and recognition of eggs are central topics in this respect. Here, we
   report the occurrence of such costs in two European passerines
   (chaffinches and blackcaps) that are good rejecters of foreign eggs,
   even though the common cuckoo does not presently use them as hosts.
   Since high rejection rates are maintained in the absence of parasitism,
   we predicted that few recognition errors are made by these species. We
   tested this prediction by monitoring the occurrence of such errors in
   both experimentally parasitised and non-parasitised host clutches. We
   found support for the prediction, as our results show that recognition
   errors are at best rare events in these two species. We discuss the role
   of intraspecific brood parasitism as well as other explanations for the
   retention of a high rejection rate in these species. Various studies
   have reported mixed support for the occurrence of recognition errors
   among cuckoo hosts, and we consider other explanations for the existence
   of both acceptors and rejecters of foreign eggs in host populations.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the weevil Mecinus janthinus Germar (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae) were monitored at 13 sites in western Canada during the
   period 1994-1999 to assess the role of overwintering mortality on the
   establishment of this biocontrol agent introduced against the weed
   Dalmatian toadflax, Linaria dalmatica (L.) Mill. (Scrophulariaceae).
   Results indicated that M. janthinus is intolerant of freezing, as
   evidenced by adult mortalities of 75-100\% occurring in about 30\% of
   the site-years examined and whenever winter temperatures reached less
   than or equal to -28 degreesC. Exposure to low sub-zero winter
   temperatures explained 70\% of the variation in adult mortality for
   sites in British Columbia. An 8-fold increase in adult mortality
   occurred in winter 1997/98 at one Alberta site monitored soon after
   temperatures dropped to less than or equal to -30 degreesC. Some
   inconsistencies in the relationship between winter temperatures and
   adult mortality at the Alberta site may be explained by the presence of
   insulating snow cover during the coldest temperatures of winters 1993/94
   and 1996/97 and unseasonably cold temperatures during the spring of
   1995. Despite the high periodic mortalities suffered by M. janthinus at
   most sites, the incidence and intensity of weevil attack on its host
   generally increased with time, thus demonstrating the resiliency of
   weevil populations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights

Abstract = {{Assays were done in the laboratory and field to monitor the response of
   Pacific coast wireworm, Limonius canus LeConte, to food baits. A
   glass-plate assay was used in laboratory trials to study movement of
   wireworm larvae through soil in response to several food baits,
   including germinating seeds of grains, rolled oats {[}Arena sativa L.
   (Poaceae)], carrot {[}Daucus carota L. (Umbelliferae)], and potato
   {[}Solanum tuberosum L. (Solanaceae)], Studies were also done with these
   baits to determine effectiveness under field conditions. In both
   laboratory and field trials, germinating seed of wheat {[}Triticum
   aestivum L. (Poaceae)] and barley {[}Hordeum vulgare L, (Poaceae)]
   ranked higher in response by larvae than the remaining food baits. In
   the glass-plate assays, 65-70\% of wireworms contacted the wheat or
   barley seed baits within a 2-h assay period. Corn {[}Zea mays L.
   (Poaceae)] seed and sliced carrot were also effective, with 60\% of
   larvae contacting the baits. Rice {[}Oryza sativa L. (Poaceae)], rye
   {[}Secale cereale L. (Poaceae)], and potato were contacted by 30-45\% of
   larvae. In the majority of assays, contact with the bait occurred within
   30 min of the start of the assay. Trail lengths varied substantially
   among larvae (0-70 cm). The field studies showed that all food baits
   captured more wireworms than unbaited traps. A second assay conducted in
   the laboratory showed that moistened rolled oats were contacted with a
   higher probability if oats were aged 72 h following wetting (51\% of
   larvae contacted the bait) than oats used immediately following wetting
   (28\% of larvae). Field trials using baits composed of different volumes
   of rolled oats showed little evidence of a dose response in capture
   rates of L. canus, although all baits Captured more wireworms than
   unbaited traps. These studies showed that L. canus is attracted to food
   baits in both laboratory and field trials, and that baits may prove
   useful to monitor populations of this pest in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of factors limiting benthic algal (periphyton) biomass is
   central to understanding energy flow in stream ecosystems and stream
   eutrophication. We used several data sets to determine how water column
   nutrients and nonnutrient factors are linked to periphytic biomass and
   if the ecoregion concept is applicable to nutrient-periphyton
   relationships. Literature values for seasonal means of biomass of
   periphyton, nutrient concentrations, and other stream characteristics
   were collected for almost 300 sampling periods from temperate streams.
   Data for benthic chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations from a subset
   of 620 stations in the United States National Stream Water-Quality
   Monitoring Networks were also analyzed. The greatest portion of variance
   in models for the mean and maximum biomass of benthic stream algae
   (about 40\%) was explained by concentrations of total N and P.
   Breakpoint regression and a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov
   statistical technique established significant breakpoints of about 30
   mug total P.L-1 and 40 mug total N.L-1, above which mean chlorophyll
   values were substantially higher. Ecoregion effects on
   nutrient-chlorophyll relationships were weak. Ecoregion effects were
   cross-correlated with anthropogenic effects such as percent urban and
   cropland area in the watershed and population density. Thus, caution is
   necessary to separate anthropogenic effects from natural variation at
   the ecoregion level.}},

Abstract = {{No national long-term monitoring system exists to estimate temporal
   changes in the area of forests within Canada. Changes in wooded area,
   defined as land at least 35\% covered by trees or shrubs with a minimum
   height of 2 m, were estimated for two study areas in central
   Saskatchewan, Canada. Sequential editions of 1 : 50 000 topographic maps
   were digitized and analyzed with a geographic information system to
   quantify changes in wooded area over approximately three decades for the
   Waskesiu Hills landscape (53degrees45' N, 106degrees15' W) and the Red
   Deer River landscape (52degrees45' N, 103degrees00' W). Both study areas
   were located within the Boreal Plain Ecozone, which was predominantly
   boreal forest prior to the past century of agricultural land clearing.
   In the 4570-km(2) Waskesiu Hills landscape, wooded area decreased by 164
   km(2) between 1963 and 1990. In the 4692-km(2) Red Deer River landscape,
   wooded area decreased by 371 km(2) in between 1957 and 1990. Estimated
   mean annual rates of change in wooded area were -0.19\% year(-1) and
   -0.43\% year(-1) for the former and latter landscapes, respectively.
   Losses of wooded area were not proportional across three land-use
   classes. Rates of change for wooded area were small in parks (0.10\%
   year(-1) and-1.02\% year(-1)) and commercial forests (0.10\% year(-1)
   and 0.22\% year(-1)), and larger in predominantly agricultural zones
   (-1.27\% year(-1) and -1.21\% year(-1) for the Waskesiu Hills landscape
   and Red Deer River landscape, respectively). These measured declines in
   wooded area do not account for losses due to roads, transmission lines,
   buildings, and other features not represented on topographic maps in an
   area-proportional manner, but this error is estimated to be very small.
   The total length of roads increased by 95 km (0.27\% year(-1) between
   1963 and 1990) in the Waskesiu Hills landscape and by 507 km (0.74\%
   year(-1) between 1957 and 1990) in the Red Deer River landscape.
   Expanding infrastructure networks were contrasted by negative rates of
   change for human population (-0.89\% year(-1) between 1961 and 1991 for
   the Waskesiu Hills region and -1.19\% year(-1) between 1956 and 1991 for
   the Red Deer River region). Within the two study areas, wooded lands
   that are unprotected by legislation remain vulnerable to future
   deforestation. Continued clearing of extant forests could jeopardize
   potential carbon gains from afforestation and reforestation initiatives
   presently being considered for marginal agricultural lands in western
   Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have documented intraspecific differences in the behavior
   of males or females. In some species, many adults are territorial while
   others have larger home ranges encompassing multiple territories.
   Although these two types of behavior have been documented, they are not
   well understood in mammals. Therefore, in the mono gamous prairie vole
   (Microtus ochrogaster) we characterized individuals that engage in these
   two behavior patterns as residents and wanderers. We monitored
   populations enclosed in 0.1-ha. enclosures at Miami University's Ecology
   Research Center. As many as 26\% of animals were wanderers: animals
   captured frequently, but less than 75\% of the time, at one nest. As
   expected, wanderers had larger home ranges than residents. Wanderers
   were primarily adult males (70\%) but included some adult females. This
   behavior pattern was not fixed, since some wanderers previously had been
   residents and at least 31\% of males and 57\% of adult female wanderers
   became residents during the same field season. Wanderers were not in
   worse physical condition, as estimated by body mass, and survived for
   slightly longer than residents. Thus, it does not appear that wanderers
   are making the best of a bad situation, but analysis of parentage is
   critical to validate this conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Few monitoring programs in North America track bird populations at a
   continental scale during the winter, a critical stage of the life cycle
   for many species. To date. only Christmas Bird Counts (CBC) have been
   used to index bird abundance in winter across North America. We
   evaluated another continentwide program, Project FeederWatch (PFW),
   which monitors many bird species more intensively than CBC. PFW is a
   survey in which volunteers use standardized methods to count birds
   visiting feeders every two weeks from November through April. We
   compared population indices and wends from PFW and CBC data for 43
   species in 3 regions of Ontario, Canada, over a 21-year period from
   1976-1997. Annual population indices from PFW were significantly
   positively correlated with similar indices from CBC for about 80\% of
   species for which annual variation in counts was substantially greater
   than sampling error. Log-linear population trends from both surveys were
   also well correlated, though the absolute value of the trend estimates
   tended to be higher for PFW The high consistency between surveys
   suggests that both may be suitable for detecting population changes for
   many bird species in winter, especially irruptive species that show
   large annual fluctuations, and species with marked population trends.
   However, some species did not correspond between surveys, despite being
   measured fairly precisely, highlighting the value of having two
   independent surveys to corroborate patterns. Christmas Bird Counts have
   the advantage that they sample more species, but Project FeederWatch has
   a more consistent protocol and continues through the winter. allowing
   analysis of Changes in populations through the winter.}},

Abstract = {{Juvenile ratios estimated using numbers of hatch year (HY) and
   after-hatch-year (AHY) Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus)
   counted concurrently during at-sea surveys have been used to estimate
   fecundity in this species. These ``concurrent{''} juvenile ratios assume
   that HY birds remain in an area, and are likely biased because they do
   not account for potential differences in emigration rate of HY and AHY
   birds. We studied the emigration rates of adult and juvenile Marbled
   Murrelets marked with radio-transmitters. Juveniles had a high
   emigration rate compared to adults. The weekly local survival rate (phi)
   of newly radio-tagged HY birds was 27\%. AHY local survival was 95\%
   during incubation and early chick rearing, suggesting a resident
   population during the breeding season. We calculated juvenile ratios
   from 1996-1998 using (1) HY counts corrected for emigration and mean AHY
   counts around the breeding season peak, and (2) HY and AHY counts from
   concurrent at-sea surveys. The average ``corrected{''} juvenile ratio
   (0.13 +/- 0.05 SE) was higher than the ``concurrent{''} juvenile ratio
   (0.04 +/- 0.02 SE) but lower than estimates of fecundity from nest
   monitoring (0.18-0.22). Low juvenile ratios from at-sea surveys could
   result either from an unknown proportion of nonbreeding birds in the
   population, or, more likely, from differences in the at-sea distribution
   of AHY and HY birds. Fluctuation in the timing of the peak number of AHY
   birds across years might result in an uncorrectable bias in the counts.
   Because of biases and potential problems, caution is needed when
   interpreting juvenile ratios from at-sea surveys.}},

Abstract = {{We used several methods to study the chronology and synchrony of
   breeding events of the Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus)
   population at Desolation Sound, British Columbia, from 1996 to 1998. The
   timing of breeding events varied among years; on average the breeding
   season lasted from 21 April to 5 September. We assessed the biases of
   each method used by comparing the results to the estimate of the
   integrated breeding chronology. Counts of hatch-year birds at sea were
   biased toward earlier breeders, missing an estimated 24\% of the
   fledglings. Two other methods, physiological analysis of the yolk
   precursor vitellogenin from blood samples and monitoring by
   radio-telemetry could produce a complete distribution of breeding events
   if sampling were done throughout laying. Observations in the forest,
   date of first observation of a fledgling at sea during the breeding
   season, and fish-holding behavior produced insufficient data to be used
   as sole indicators of breeding chronology of this species. In general,
   breeding synchrony in alcids, assessed using data from a literature
   review, was unrelated to feeding habits but increased with latitude
   (41\% of the variation was explained by latitude). Marbled Murrelets,
   however, bred less synchronously than predicted for an alcid at this
   latitude (50degreesN).}},

Abstract = {{We used radar to count numbers of Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus
   marmoratus) flying inland within 10 river drainages on the Olympic
   Peninsula, Washington, during 1998-2000. We tested whether the numbers
   of murrelets entering drainages could be predicted from the amount and
   spatial configuration of low-elevation, late-seral forest (potential
   murrelet nesting habitat) within drainages. The maximal number of
   murrelet radar targets was positively correlated with the amount of
   late-seral forest in each of the three years sampled; this relationship
   persisted in 1999 and 2000 when controlling for drainage size. Murrelet
   radar counts were not correlated with the combined amounts of harvested,
   developed, and agricultural lands in any year. Numbers of murrelets
   increased as the amount of core area of late-seral forest and proximity
   of patches increased, and decreased with increasing amounts of edge of
   Late-seral patches. Numbers were not correlated with the percent of
   late-seral forest, patch density, patch size, road density, or the
   overall diversity of all habitat types within landscapes. Neither the
   maximal nor the mean number of inbound Marbled Murrelets differed among
   years; the effect of year was small relative to the effect of habitat on
   murrelet numbers. Our results suggest that changes in the amount or
   distribution of nesting habitat should result in detectable changes in
   murrelet numbers at the scale of individual drainages. Thus, the amount
   and distribution of nesting habitat may play a role in the regulation of
   Marbled Murrelet populations, supporting the contention that providing
   nesting habitat is an effective conservation and restoration technique
   for this species.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptation of three allopatric populations of a generalist moth,
   Operophtera brumata (L.), on two tree species, Prunus padus (L.) and
   Quercus robur (L.) which represent the extremes of the timing of
   budburst in spring, was studied in Finland and Sweden. The synchrony of
   the hatching and budbursting was monitored, and its importance to
   dispersal and growth of larvae was assessed by rearing cohorts of
   larvae, whose hatching dates were manipulated, on both hosts. In
   addition, the realised heritability of the hatching time was estimated.
   Experimental populations hatched in approximate synchrony with the
   budburst of their original host species. As a result of the manipulation
   of the hatching dates of larvae, the growth rates of larvae decreased
   and the dispersal rates increased on both hosts in relation to the
   ageing of foliage. The realised heritability of hatching times was
   rather high (0.63). There were fewer differences in the host use
   efficiency and behaviour of the experimental populations than in the
   hatching phenology. The synchrony of hatching with the budburst of the
   local dominant host plant is probably a result of stabilising selection.}},

Abstract = {{Cydia molesta Busck (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), a major pest of stone
   fruits and an increasingly important late season pest of apple, is
   predominately monitored by pheromone trapping of male moths. We
   investigated flight performance in relation to sex, age, and mating
   status using computer-linked flight mills, and also examined the
   relationship between female flight and reproduction. The crepuscular
   flight pattern of the experimental moths in relation to photointensity
   was very similar to that reported from field studies. Female moths
   significantly outperformed males in all measured flight parameters
   including total distance flown, distance of longest single flight, and
   velocity. The proportion of long-flying females (categorised as those
   completing an unbroken flight of greater than 1 km) was three to six
   times greater than that of males. Female flight performance was not
   related to mating status, but mated males displayed significantly
   greater flight than unmated males. The maximal flight period of mated
   females commenced on the third day after eclosion, following 30\% egg
   deposition. Male flight was not significantly related to age. The data
   suggest that a limited proportion of the population, in particular
   females, may have the capacity to make inter-orchard flights. The
   limitations of monitoring C. molesta populations in apple orchards
   solely by pheromone trapping of males are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Residential pesticide use is widespread in the United States. However,
   data are limited specific to use among minority populations. Nor are
   data available on the extent of pesticide exposure resulting from
   residential use during pregnancy. We have gathered questionnaire data on
   pesticide use in the home during pregnancy from 316 African-American and
   Dominican women residing in northern Manhattan and the South Bronx.
   Additionally, 72 women underwent personal air monitoring for 48 hr
   during their third trimester of pregnancy to determine exposure levels
   to 21 pesticides (19 insecticides and 2 fungicides). Of the women
   questioned, 266 of 314 (85\%) reported that pest control measures were
   used in the home during pregnancy; 111 of 314 (35\%) reported that their
   homes were sprayed by an exterminator, and of those, 45\% said the
   spraying was done more than once per month. Most (2 90\%) of the
   pesticide was used for cockroach control. Use of pest control measures
   increased significantly with the level of housing disrepair reported. Of
   the women monitored, all (100\%) had detectable levels of three
   insecticides: the organophosphates diazinon (range, 2.0-6,010 ng/m(3))
   and chlorpyrifos (range, 0.7-193 ng/m(3)) and the carbamate propoxur
   (range, 3.8-1,380 ng/m(3)), as well as the fungicide o-phenylphenol
   (range, 5.7-743 ng/m3). We also frequently detected the following four
   insecticides (47-83\% of samples) but at lower concentrations: the
   pyrethroid trans-permethrin, piperonyl butoxide (an indicator of
   exposure to pyrethrins), and the organochlorines
   1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane and chlordane. Thirty
   percent of the women had detectable levels of all eight pesticides.
   Exposures were generally higher among African Americans than among
   Dominicans. We detected other pesticides in less than or equal to 10\%
   of samples. Results show widespread prenatal pesticide use among
   minority women in this cohort. Diazinon exposures for some women may
   have exceeded health-based levels, and our findings support recent
   federal action to phase out residential use of this insecticide.}},

Abstract = {{Resource exploitation in lowland tropical forests is increasing and
   causing loss of biodiversity. Effective evaluation and management of the
   impacts of development on tropical forests requires appropriate
   assessment and monitoring tools. We propose the use of 0.1-ha
   multi-scale, modified Whittaker plots (MWPs) to assess and monitor
   vegetation in lowland tropical rainforests. We established MWPs at 4
   sites to: (1) describe and compare composition and structure of the
   sites using MWPs, (2) compare these results to those of 1-ha permanent
   vegetation plots (BDPs), and (3) evaluate the ability of MWPs to detect
   changes in populations (statistical power). We recorded more than 400
   species at each site. Species composition among the sites was
   distinctive, while mean abundance and basal area was similar.
   Comparisons between MWPs and BDPs show that they record similar species
   composition and abundance and that both perform equally well at
   detecting rare species. However, MWPs tend to record more species, and
   power analysis studies show that MWPs were more effective at detecting
   changes in the mean number of species of trees greater than or equal
   to10 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) and in herbaceous plants. Ten
   MWPs were sufficient to detect a change of 11\% in the mean number of
   herb species, and they were able to detect a 14\% change in the mean
   number of species of trees greater than or equal to10 cm dbh. The value
   of MWPs for assessment and monitoring is discussed, along with
   recommendations for improving the sampling design to increase power.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of amphibians and reptiles are experiencing new or
   increasing threats to their survival. Many of these threats are directly
   attributable to human activity and resource development. This presents
   the increasing need for worldwide amphibian and reptile assessments and
   effective, standardized monitoring protocols. Adaptive management
   techniques can assist managers in identifying and mitigating threats to
   amphibian and reptile populations. In 1996, Shell Prospecting and
   Development, Peru initiated a natural gas exploration project in the
   rainforest of southeastern Peru. The Smithsonian Institution's
   Monitoring and Assessment of Biodiversity Program worked closely with
   Shell engineers and managers to establish an adaptive management program
   to protect the region's biodiversity. In this manuscript, we discuss the
   steps we took to establish an adaptive management program for amphibian
   and reptile communities in the region. We define and outline the
   conceptual issues involved in establishing an assessment and monitoring
   program, including setting objectives, evaluating the results and making
   appropriate decisions. We also provide results from the assessment and
   discuss the appropriateness and effectiveness of protocols and criteria
   used for selecting species to monitor.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an assessment and monitoring plan for birds in connection
   with the exploration and potential development of a large natural gas
   field in the Lower Urubamba drainage of Peru, a project of Shell
   Prospecting and Development Peru (SPDP). Our objectives were to: (1)
   inventory the birds in the area, including information on habitat use
   and abundance, and (2) devise long-term monitoring protocols for birds.
   We sampled birds through a combination of visual and auditory surveys
   and mist-netting at 4 well sites and 3 sites along the Urubamba and
   Camisea rivers. We recorded 420 species during 135 days of field work.
   We consider the highest priorities for a future monitoring program to
   be: (1) establish whether edge effects are occurring at well sites,
   along roads and along the planned pipeline route and determine the
   significance and extent of these effects and (2) assess the impact of
   increased human access to the area on game and other exploited species.
   The remoteness of the area, its rugged terrain and dense vegetation and
   the lack of trained personnel limit the choice of survey and monitoring
   methods. We recommend use of mist-netting and transects for monitoring
   edge effects and use of transects for monitoring game and other
   exploited species.}},

Abstract = {{Few models evaluate the effects of forest management options on wildlife
   habitat and incorporate temporal and spatial trends in forest growth.
   Moreover, existing habitat models do not explicitly consider economic
   trade-offs or allow for landscape level projections. To address these
   concerns, we linked standard wildlife habitat suitability models with
   habitat projections from the Landscape Management System (LMS). LMS
   integrates spatially explicit forest inventories with forest growth,
   decay, and silviculture treatment (e.g., planting, thinning, harvesting)
   models to compare some economic and biological impacts of forest
   management on wildlife habitats at spatial scales ranging from the
   individual forest stand to the landscape. We used LMS to quantify
   pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus), Cooper's hawk (Accipiter
   cooperi), and southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) habitat
   qualities across landscapes and to project habitat changes through time.
   We modeled five forest management scenarios (including no action,
   intensive management for timber production, moderate management and
   intensive management to enhance mature forest structure, and mixed
   management for wildlife and timber) proposed for the 566 ha Satsop
   Forest in western Washington. The selected wildlife species' habitats
   (mixture of mature conifer and deciduous forests) were maximized by
   simply allowing the forest to grow with no management. However, this
   cost an estimated \$929,539/yr in lost timber revenue. Intensive
   thinning, replanting, and retention of large trees increased habitat for
   all focal species and provided \$384,558/yr return from timber. Because
   of potential short-term reductions in habitat that occur during
   long-term enhancement strategies (e.g., intensive thinning) and limited
   ability to model understory growth dynamics, monitoring and validation
   of predictions would be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{We used data from the USDA Forest Service Northern Region Landbird
   Monitoring Program to investigate the effects of partial-cut timber
   harvesting on bird abundances in conifer forests within the northern
   Rocky Mountains. We present point-count data from four separate years of
   the long-term monitoring database, which included between 467 and 907
   points, depending on the year. Five bird species were significantly more
   abundant in uncut forest stands in at least one year, and 17 species
   were more abundant in partially cut stands in at least one year. Four
   and eight species from these two groups, respectively, showed the same
   differences in a short-term, control/treatment comparison conducted in
   the same region, and no species showed contradictory treatment effects
   when the two studies were compared. Provided that vegetation data are
   coupled with bird abundance data, and provided that enough points are
   visited to compensate for an uncontrolled design, these results suggest
   that data from long-term monitoring points can be useful not only as
   sources of information about long-term population trends, but as sources
   of information about habitat relationships and the effects of land use.}},

Abstract = {{From 1945 to 1980, over 500 weapons tests were conducted in the
   atmosphere at a number of locations around the world. These tests
   resulted in the release of substantial quantities of radioactive debris
   to the environment. Local, intermediate, and global fallout deposition
   densities downwind from test sites depended on the heights of bursts,
   the yields, and the half-lives and volatilities of the particular
   fission or activation products, as well as on the meteorological
   conditions. A number of national and international monitoring programs
   were established to trace the fallout through the atmosphere and
   biosphere. These programs included continuous monitoring of ground-level
   air, exposure rates, and deposition as well as periodic sampling of
   food, bone, water, soil, and stratospheric air. Although data for
   specific high-yield tests are still classified, the fission and fusion
   yields of the various tests and test series have been estimated and from
   this information the quantities of specific fission and activation
   products released into the atmosphere have been determined. The
   geographic and temporal variations in the fallout deposition of specific
   radionuclides based on both actual measurements and model calculations
   are discussed in this paper. A feasibility study to estimate the
   deposition density (deposition per unit area) of particular
   radionuclides from both Nevada Test Site and ``global{''} fallout on a
   county-by-county scale for the continental United States is described.
   These deposition estimates provide a basis for reconstructing population
   exposure and dose. They support the feasibility of a more detailed
   evaluation of the population doses that resulted from fallout from
   atmospheric tests to document the experience fully and to report results
   more systematically and completely to the world community. The impact of
   weapons fallout will continue to be felt for years to come since a
   contaminant baseline has been imposed on the ambient radiation
   environment that will be an important factor in the assessment of past
   and future releases of radioactive materials into the biosphere.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews examples of how measurements of global fallout in the
   environment and related tracer radionuclides have been used to enhance
   our basic knowledge of biogeochemical processes and food-chain pathways.
   Because it is these fundamental, natural processes that control the
   transport and accumulation of such trace substances in the environment,
   direct measurements of trace substances over time and space reveal
   strong insights into these processes. The necessity to monitor global
   fallout transport, although largely motivated by human health concerns,
   gave rise to a plethora of new information about plants, animals, and
   natural and agricultural ecosystems and how they function. This review
   provides a small selection of examples in the areas of plant and animal
   physiology, productivity and energy transfer in food chains,
   biogeochemical cycles of certain elements and their analogues, feeding
   relationships and movements of organisms, and the agriculture-based
   human food chain. It is concluded that if society is to cope
   successfully with continued growth of the human population and resource
   consumption, more knowledge is still required about these fundamental
   processes. The use of radiotracers can contribute greatly to this need,
   but current funding priorities, societal attitudes, and onerous
   regulations on the use of radioactivity may continue to limit such
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We studied dynamics of four populations of New Zealand forest birds
   for 5-9 years after reintroduction to islands. We primarily aimed to
   predict whether these populations were viable, and what, if any,
   management was needed to maintain them. However, the small scale of
   these islands also provided an opportunity to study density-dependent
   population growth over a short time frame.
   Location We studied New Zealand robin (toutouwai, Petroica australis)
   and stitchbird (hihi, Notiomystis cincta) populations reintroduced to
   Tiritiri Matangi, a 220-ha offshore island near Auckland, and saddleback
   (tieke, Philesturnus carunculatus) and stitchbird populations
   reintroduced to Mokoia, a 135-ha island in Lake Rotorua. These islands
   are free of mammalian predators, but have highly modified habitat
   following clearing and regeneration.
   Methods We closely monitored each population, individually marking all
   or most of the birds and in some cases experimentally manipulated
   population density or food supply. We used model selection procedures to
   understand factors affecting survival, fecundity and dispersal, and
   developed stochastic simulation models.
   Results The Tiritiri Matangi robin and Mokoia saddleback populations
   grew without management and appear to be viable. Both showed strong
   evidence of density-dependent growth, with fecundity (saddlebacks) and
   juvenile survival (both populations) declining with increasing density.
   Neither stitchbird population appears viable without management and
   supplementation experiments showed reproduction and/or survival to be
   limited by food supply. The Tiritiri Matangi population appears viable
   as long as supplementary feeding continues. However, the Mokoia
   population has a high mortality rate regardless of supplementary
   feeding, resulting in tenuous viability even with intensive management.
   Mokoia stitchbirds suffer from infection by Aspergillus fumigatus, a
   pathogenic fungus that is prevalent in highly modified habitats and more
   abundant on Mokoia than Tiritiri Matangi.
   Main conclusions Some forest birds can thrive in regenerating forest on
   islands and strong evidence of density dependence can be detected in
   such populations in as little as 5 years. This allows density-dependent
   models to be developed, providing guidance when island populations are
   harvested for further translocations. Other species are limited by food
   supply in regenerating environments, a problem potentially overcome by
   management. However, prevalence of A. fumigatus may render highly
   modified environments uninhabitable by some species regardless of
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Aim In this study we tested the hypothesis that the dispersal success
   (estimated here as fruit removal rate) of a native shrub species living
   in the Balearic Archipelago, Cneorum tricoccon L. (Cneoraceae), has
   decreased significantly in those islands where endemic lizards of the
   genus Podarcis have disappeared. These lizards acted as the main seed
   dispersers of the plant and became extinct after the introduction of
   carnivores. At least one of these carnivores, the pine marten (Martes
   martes L.), is also an important frugivore, consuming the fruits and
   dispersing the seeds of C. tricoccon and thus allowing the comparison of
   fruit removal rates between the two groups of vertebrates (lizards and
   mammals). We further tested the possibility that lizards (in particular,
   P. pityusensis Bosca) could be exerting selection on seed size.
   Methods In seven populations from four islands, we monitored fruit
   removal by either lizards or mammals. The fruits of C. tricoccon do not
   drop after ripening, remaining attached to the branches for long periods
   if not removed. In order to test whether lizards might be exerting
   selection on seed size, we compared seed diameter and weight between
   defecated and uningested (collected directly from plants) seeds for each
   of the populations.
   Results Fruits were removed in significantly greater proportions in
   those populations where lizards are still present. Data showed that in
   two of the examined populations in the Pityusic islands, defecated seeds
   were lighter and smaller than controls suggesting that lizards selected
   fruits of smaller size than the average of the population.
   Main conclusions The introduction of carnivores in the Balearics has led
   to important changes in the population dynamics of many native species.
   In the larger islands (Mallorca and Menorca), carnivores seemed to have
   caused the extinction of endemic lizards who acted as the only
   dispersers of some plants such as C. tricoccon. Pine martens, in
   particular, are in turn frugivorous and thus can `replace' to some
   extent the `lost' seed dispersers. We hypothesize that besides having
   decreased fruit removal rates in this shrub, these `new' dispersers have
   modified considerably the distribution of the plant on Mallorca island,
   as the fossil record shows that lizards lived at low altitudes (<500 m
   a.s.l.) and the plant can be currently found up to 1000 m a.s.l.
   Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that lizards might be exerting a
   selective pressure on seed size. If this is true, this pressure might
   have been released - or counteracted if carnivores select for fruit size
   as well - after the extinction of lizards from some islands, which would
   have important ecological consequences for the plant.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We examined whether developmental instability can be used as a
   bio-monitoring tool in the endangered Taita thrush (Turdus helleri L.)
   through the measurement of individual levels of fluctuating asymmetry in
   tarsus length. Because estimates of the association between
   developmental instability, stress and fitness derived from traditional
   regression are biased, we compared parameter estimates obtained from
   likelihood based analysis with those obtained from a Bayesian latent
   variable model.
   Location Taita thrushes were captured and measured in three isolated
   cloud forest fragments located in the Taita Hills of south-east Kenya.
   Methods We applied mixed-effects regression with Restricted Maximum
   Likelihood parameter estimation (performed with SAS version 8.0) and
   Bayesian latent variable modelling (performed with WINBUGS version 1.3
   and CODA version 0.4) to estimate unbiased levels of developmental
   instability and to model relationships between developmental instability
   and body condition in 312 Taita thrushes.
   Results Likelihood and Bayesian analyses yielded highly comparable
   results. Individual levels of developmental instability were strongly
   inversely related to body condition in the subpopulation with the lowest
   average condition. In contrast, both variables were unrelated in two
   other subpopulations with higher average condition. Such heterogeneity
   in association was in the direction expected by developmental theory,
   given that higher condition suggests more benign ambient conditions. The
   estimated levels of body condition in the three subpopulations did not
   support their presumed ranking in relation to environmental stress.
   Developmental instability and body condition are therefore believed to
   reflect different aspects of individual fitness.
   Main conclusions Variation in developmental homeostasis, either modelled
   as observable variable (fluctuating asymmetry) or latent variable
   (developmental instability), appears a useful indicator of stress
   effects in the Taita thrush. Because relationships between environmental
   stress and developmental instability may depend on the extent to which
   stress-mediated changes in other components of phenotypic variation are
   correlated, the study of trait asymmetry should preferably be combined
   with that of other measures of trait variability, such as trait size or
   organismal condition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an integrated spatial and temporal modeling system
   developed mathematically for assessing microbial contaminants on
   animal-grazed farmlands. The model uses fecal coliform, specifically
   Escherichia coli, as an indicator of fecal contamination and describes
   the sources, sinks, transport processes, and fate of L coli contaminants
   in catchments and associated streams. Spatial features include grazing
   location, land topography, distance to a nearby stream, and distance
   through the stream network to the outlet. Temporal features are
   population dynamics on the land surface, in now, and on streambeds. The
   model applies the principles of conservation of mass balance on two
   different types of pools: grid cells on land surfaces and networked
   stream segments. The model aims to improve the prediction of the effects
   of different land management strategies on the fecal contamination of
   waterways. This is achieved by characterizing the movement of fecal
   contaminants from land to streams and in-stream mobilization. Processes
   of attenuation, diffusion, and transport govern the movement. Our study
   site is a hill land catchment with an area of 140 ha and is used
   exclusively for animal grazing. The model was calibrated with previous
   research results, and then tested using the data collected at the outlet
   of the catchment. The sensitivity of the model predictions was analyzed
   for different scenarios: effect of stock rate, attenuation rate, and
   flow volumes. The similar pattern between monitored and predicted E coli
   concentration proved that the model captures the key features that
   control the population dynamics of fecal contaminants. Further
   experiments are required to expand the model's functionality for
   covering more mitigation options.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of saturated molecular maps promised rapid progress towards
   the improvement of crops for genetically complex traits like drought
   resistance via analysis of quantitative trait loci (OTL). Progress with
   the identification of QTLs for drought resistance-related traits in rice
   is summarized here with the emphasis on a mapping population of a cross
   between drought-resistant varieties Azucena and Bala. Data which have
   used root morphological traits and indicators of drought avoidance in
   field-grown plants are reviewed, highlighting problems and uncertainties
   with the OTL approach. The contribution of root-growth QTLs to drought
   avoidance appears small in the experiments so far conducted, and the
   limitations of screening methodologies and the involvement of
   shoot-related mechanisms of drought resistance are studied. When
   compared to Azucena, Bala has been observed to have highly sensitive
   stomata, does not roll its leaves readily, has a greater ability to
   adjust osmotically, slows growth more rapidly when droughted and has a
   lower water-use efficiency. It is also a semi-dwarf variety and hence
   has a different canopy structure. There is a need to clarify the
   contribution of the shoot to drought resistance from the level of the
   biochemistry of photosynthesis through stomatal behaviour and leaf
   anatomy to canopy architecture. Recent advances in studying the physical
   and biochemical processes related to water use and drought stress offer
   the opportunity to advance a more holistic understanding of drought
   resistance. These include the potential use of infrared thermal imaging
   to study energy balance, integrated and online stable isotope analysis
   to dissect processes involved in carbon dioxide fixation and water
   evaporation, and leaf fluorescence to monitor photosynthesis and
   photochemical quenching. Justification and a strategy for this
   integrated approach is described, which has relevance to the study of
   drought resistance in most crops.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have developed a variety of computer-based models to
   estimate population exposure to air pollution, These models typically
   estimate exposures by simulating the movement of specific population
   groups through defined microenvironments. Exposures in the motor vehicle
   microenvironment are significantly affected by air exchange rate, which
   in turn is affected by vehicle speed, window position, vent status, and
   air conditioning use. A pilot study was conducted in Houston, Texas,
   during September 2000 for a specific set of weather, vehicle speed, and
   road type conditions to determine whether useful information on the
   position of windows, sunroofs, and convertible tops could be obtained
   through the use of video cameras. Monitoring was conducted at three
   sites (two arterial roads and one interstate highway) on the perimeter
   of Harris County located in or near areas not subject to mandated
   Inspection and Maintenance programs. Each site permitted an elevated
   view of vehicles as they proceeded through a turn, thereby exposing all
   windows to the stationary video camera. Five videotaping sessions were
   conducted over a two-day period in which the Heat Index (HI)-a function
   of temperature and humidity-varied from 80 to 101 degrees F and vehicle
   speed varied from 30 to 74 mph. The resulting videotapes were processed
   to create a master database listing vehicle-specific data for site
   location, date, time, vehicle type (e.g., minivan), color, window
   configuration (e.g., four windows and sunroof), number of windows in
   each of three position categories ( fully open, partially open, and
   closed), HI, and speed. Of the 758 vehicles included in the database,
   140 (18.5 percent) were labeled as ``open,{''} indicating a window,
   sunroof, or convertible top was fully or partially open. The results of
   a series of stepwise linear regression analyses indicated that the
   probability of a vehicle in the master database being ``open{''} was
   weakly affected by time of day, vehicle type, vehicle color, vehicle
   speed, and HI, In particular, open windows occurred more frequently when
   vehicle speed was less than 50 mph during periods when HI exceeded 99.9
   degrees F and the vehicle was a minivan or passenger van. Overall, the
   pilot study demonstrated that data on factors affecting vehicle window
   position could be acquired through a relatively simple experimental
   protocol using a single video camera. Limitations of the study requiring
   further research include the inability to determine the status of the
   vehicle air conditioning system; lack of a wide range of weather,
   vehicle speed, and road type conditions; and the need to exclude some
   vehicles from statistical analyses due to ambiguous window positions.}},

Abstract = {{In 1998, the toxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   were detected in Thau Lagoon, France. The causative organism was
   identified as Alexandrium tamarense, a member of the `tamarensis'
   species complex. This dinoflagellate was first observed in the lagoon in
   1995 by a monitoring programme following more than a decade with no
   observations of this species. The species is thus new to these waters,
   but its origins were unknown. In this paper, morphological and molecular
   data are anaysed for two clonal cultures established from the 1998
   bloom. These data are compared to results from Alexandrium isolates
   originating elsewhere in the world to infer an origin. Thecal plate
   morphology, restriction fragment length polymorphism, DNA sequencing and
   toxin analyses demonstrate that the Thau Lagoon strains are A.
   catenella, and are closely related to populations of A. catenella found
   in temperate Asia, specfically the Japanese Temperate Asian riboype of
   the tamarense/catenella/fundyense species complex. They show no homology
   with strains from western European waters, including the Mediterranean.
   Until now, the Japanese Temperate Asian ribotype has not been reported
   outside the western Pacific. The most likely scenario is that A.
   catenella was introduced to Thau Lagoon via the ballast water of a ship
   docked at Sete, France, a shipping port in direct communication with the
   lagoon. This case provides a clear example of the dispersal of a toxic
   Alexandrium species, probably via human activities.}},

Abstract = {{White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus dacotensis Zimm.) numbers in
   the central Black Hills have declined since the middle 1970s. Population
   status has been documented by a decline in hunter success, deer
   reproductive success, and fawn survival. Most management agencies
   believe habitat deterioration is the primary cause of population decline
   in the Black Hills. We evaluated habitat selection for a white-tailed
   deer herd in the central Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. From
   July 1993-July 1996, 73 adult and yearling doe and 12 adult and yearling
   buck white-tailed deer were radiocollared and visually monitored.
   Habitat information was collected at 4,662 white-tailed deer locations
   and 1,087 random locations. During winter, white-tailed deer selected
   ponderosa pine- (Pinus ponderosa P. \& C. Lawson) deciduous and burned
   pine cover types. Overstory-understory habitats selected included
   pine/grass-forb, pine/bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng.),
   pine/snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus L.), burned pine/grass-forb, and
   pine/shrub habitats. Structural stages selected included sapling-pole
   pine stands with >70\% canopy cover, burned pine saplingpole and
   saw-timber stands with <40\% canopy cover. During summer, white-tailed
   deer selected pine-deciduous, aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.),
   aspen-coniferous, spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and
   spruce-deciduous cover types. Overstory-understory habitats selected
   included pine/juniper (Juniperus communis L.), aspen/shrubs,
   spruce/juniper, and spruce/shrub habitats. Structural stages selected
   included pine, aspen, and spruce sapling pole stands with all levels
   (0-40\%, 41-70\%, 71-100\%) of canopy cover. Results supported low
   habitat quality as a factor involved with the decline of the deer
   population. We recommend that habitat management techniques, such as
   aspen regeneration and prescribed burns, be used to improve the habitat
   base in the central Black Hills.}},

Abstract = {{Anguilla is a UK overseas (non-independent) territory in the Caribbean.
   It is a small middle-income island with a population of 13 000, and
   recent statistics indicate that it is more dependent on tourism than any
   other country or territory in the world. Rapid population growth and
   development have placed more emphasis on the need for human health and
   environmental protection. For the first time, a systematic water-quality
   monitoring programme has been developed, based on the realities of the
   local situation, e.g. low resource base, limited capabilities,
   dependence on household rainwater catchment, storage cisterns, and a
   poor water-supply network. Development of the programme incorporated the
   key themes of pragmatic, realistic, incremental, responsive, and
   consultative approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Management of whale shark Rhincodon typus populations is hampered by a
   lack of information on the range travelled by individual whale sharks,
   This applies particularly in South-east Asia where the whale shark is
   increasingly used in commercial trade and for ecotourism. In this study
   an investigation of the movements of individual whale sharks from the
   greater Sulu Sea region was initiated using satellite telemetry. The
   movements of six sharks were monitored from 7 to 128 days. Two sharks
   travelled distances of 4567 and 8025 km. Both sharks moved through
   multiple political jurisdictions, confirming the need to manage the
   populations on a Multilateral or regional level.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified the spatial and temporal variability of crustacean
   zooplankton abundance at annual time steps with 261 lake-years of data
   from 22 lakes in three regions of central North America. None of these
   lakes had been experimentally manipulated. Using a nested three-way
   analysis of variance, we apportioned variance among years, regions,
   lakes, and their interactions for 10 functional groups and 4 larger
   taxonomic aggregates. We proposed that relative variation in the
   abundance of zooplankton would be greatest among regions and lakes and
   least among years. We also explored how variability differed among
   functional groups and changed with taxonomic aggregation. Spatial
   sources of variation dominated the analysis, but a large interaction
   between lakes and years indicated that time cannot be ignored. Regional
   variation was half that found among lakes. Relative variance components
   differed widely among functional groups, which indicates that species
   will differ in their response to environmental controls and sensitivity
   to perturbation. Total explained variation also differed widely among
   zooplankton and decreased with increasing aggregation of taxa. Whether
   choosing ecological indicators or designing experiments and monitoring
   programs, these results clearly show that large-scale temporal and
   spatial variability will be an important consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variability data were used
   to study outbreaks of Mediterranean fruit fly in California in the years
   1992-94 and 1997-99. A total of 359 flies caught in monitoring traps
   during these years were examined at three polymorphic mtDNA restriction
   sites and two microsatellite loci. Composite genotypes obtained through
   analysis of these markers indicate at least five independent
   introductions of medflies into California between 1992 and 1998. Whereas
   the majority of specimens displayed a single mtDNA haplotype (AAA),
   variation of microsatellite alleles among these flies suggests at least
   one additional introduction in 1993 into southern California. Flies
   displaying the AAB haplotype sampled in 1992 both in northern and
   southern California shared microsatellite alleles absent in AAA flies
   although lacking others commonly found in AAA specimens, thus supporting
   the hypothesis of an independent introduction of these flies from a
   different source. In contrast to earlier infestations, a few specimens
   caught in southern California in 1993 and again in 1998 showed both
   mtDNA and microsatellite patterns consistent with a Hawaiian origin.
   Single flies collected in Santa Clara County in 1997 and in El Monte,
   Los Angeles County \& in 1999 most likely represent a sixth and seventh
   distinct introduction, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Using a novel approach based on melting peak analysis of PCR products,
   we have developed a semi-quantitative assay to measure the relative
   proportions of Globodera pallida and Globodera rostochiensis in a sample
   of potato cyst nematodes (PCN). The method depends on a competitive
   multiplex PCR where the products of each species can be separated by
   their distinct melting temperatures (T-m). The melting curves of the
   products are measured by continual fluorescence monitoring in the
   presence of the intercalating dye SYBR Green I whilst gradually
   increasing the temperature. Varying the proportion of cysts of each PCN
   species gave rise to melting curves with different peak heights, which
   reflected the relative amounts of each DNA in the sample. By calculating
   the ratio of the melting peak heights at the Tm of each product and
   comparing it with standards run under the same conditions, it was
   possible to estimate the proportion of each product in the mixture.
   Sensitivity was such that 2\% of G. pallida cysts in a mixture could be
   detected. All results predicted by the analysis were confirmed by
   agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products. The method is rapid,
   reproducible and following DNA extraction, up to 25 samples can be
   analysed in an hour.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality limits are seldom identified as management objectives in

   approximate mortality caps that reflect threshold objectives about fish

   of intervals to account for uncertainties caused by measurement error,
   model assumption violations, and environmental fluctuations. The
   intervals represent danger zones that trigger intensified monitoring and
   reductions in harvest. Monitoring the status of the population relative
   to a mortality cap would require frequent estimates of fish size and
   less frequent estimates of mortality. The methods can be used with data
   obtained from angler harvest surveys and routine population sampling.}},

Journal = {{PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-36}},

Abstract = {{A strain of house fly was collected from the Third Yumenoshima Island in
   Japan and selected with the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin.
   Resistance to permethrin evolved to >18,400-fold in the selected (YPER)
   strain, and the mechanisms and genetics of resistance in this strain
   were examined. Permethrin resistance was decreased by pretreatment with
   piperonyl butoxide or 2-propynyl 2,3,6-trichlorophenyl ether, but not
   S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate or diethylmaleate. The level of total
   cytochromes P450 was 2.7-fold increased, and the level of cytochrome
   b(5) was 1.5-fold increased, in YPER compared to the susceptible CS
   strain. These results suggest P450 monooxygenases, but not hydrolases or
   glutathione S-transferase, are a mechanism of resistance in the YPER
   strain. Analysis of the para-homologous sodium channel alpha-subunit
   gene in YPER indicates this strain has the super-kdr allele. Permethrin
   resistance in the YPER strain was inherited as a multigenic and
   incompletely recessive trait. A factorial analysis of resistance in the
   YPER strain indicated the relative contribution to resistance by the
   different autosomes was 2 > 3 > 5 greater than or equal to 1. Comparison
   of YPER with three other strains of house fly having high levels of
   permethrin resistance (LPR, NG98, and ALHF) indicates the genetic basis
   of this trait is variable between populations. This indicates there may
   be a greater difficulty for the development of diagnostic tools that
   could be used reliably over large areas to monitor pyrethroid resistance
   in house flies than was previously thought. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Kinosternid mud turtles, a primarily aquatic group, exhibit variable
   degrees of terrestrial activity in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.
   We compared behavioral and physiological responses to dry conditions in
   four populations representing three species, Kinosternon sonoriense,
   Kinosternon flavescens, and Kinosternon hirtipes. All four groups were
   subjected to simulated dry season conditions in the laboratory, during
   which activity was monitored and physiological responses ( blood
   chemistry and rates of resting metabolism and evaporative water loss)
   were measured. Kinosternon flavescens and K. hirtipes represented
   extremes in apparent ability to estivate, based on activity and rate of
   increase of plasma osmolality. Two populations of K. sonoriense
   exhibited intraspecific differences in behavioral and physiological
   measures that were related to extant environmental conditions. Large
   numbers of K. sonoriense from Arizona and K. hirtipes, the poorest
   estivators, had to be rehydrated after only 30 d out of water.
   Kinosteron flavescens had the lowest metabolic rates, but no evidence of
   metabolic depression during dehydration was found for any of the four
   populations. We conclude that the differences in capacity for estivation
   among populations are primarily linked to variable behavioral responses
   to dry conditions, though high rates of evaporative water loss in K.
   hirtipes represent a probable physiological constraint.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the inoculation of
   endophytic N-2-fixing bacteria on the development of micropropagated
   sugarcane plants. The endophytic population of each inoculated species
   was monitored during the growth period, and biological nitrogen fixation
   (BNF) contribution of each inoculation treatment was assessed using the
   N-15-isotope dilution technique. Seven different combinations of
   inoculum were used, using five endophytic diazotrophic species
   (Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, Herbaspirillum seropedicae,
   Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans, Azospirillum amazonense and
   Burkholderia sp.), originally isolated from sugarcane plants. The
   results showed a clear physiological effect on the development of the
   inoculated plants, resulting in alteration of the dry
   matter-partitioning pattern and increase on root dry matter as compared
   to uninoculated plants. Indeed, all inoculated diazotrophic species
   could be reisolated in high numbers from the rhizomes of the inoculated
   plants, even 400 days after inoculation (DAI), suggesting the
   establishment of the inoculated bacteria. However, a negative effect of
   the mixture of all five species on the survival of plantlets was
   observed 45 days after inoculation, just after acclimatization. The
   analysis of the BNF contribution using the N-15-isotope dilution
   technique showed that inoculation promoted some increase in the BNF
   contribution to the plant tissues. The best treatment was the mixture of
   all five strains, followed by the treatment with a mixture of
   Herbaspirillum spp. The contribution was much lower when the plants were
   inoculated with a mixture of G. diazotrophicus with A. amazonense and
   Burkholderia sp. A BNF contribution around 30\% of total nitrogen
   accumulated was observed in micropropagated plants inoculated with the
   mixture of strains, suggesting that the combination of species in the
   inocula is the best strategy to improve sugarcane crops dependent on the
   biological nitrogen fixation process.}},

Abstract = {{Virulence-avirulence phenotypes of Puccinia striiformis isolates
   collected in Lebanon and Syria were determined on seedlings of the
   wheat-yellow rust differential genotypes. We found 25 and I I
   physiologic races over 6 years (1994 to 1999) in Syria and Lebanon,
   respectively. The composition of physiologic races found in Syria and
   Lebanon differed greatly between 1994 and 1999. Races identified in
   1999, such as 230E150 and 230E134, have wider spectra of virulence on
   resistant genotypes than races collected in 1994. In Lebanon, three
   races were found in 1994 compared with six races in 1999. Yellow rust
   differential genotypes were used in a trap nursery to monitor yellow
   rust populations under natural conditions. Races identified from
   cultivars in the trap nursery in Syria and Lebanon, and from land race
   cultivars in Iraq, were recovered among the races identified from farm
   fields. Yellow rust samples were collected from Yemen, and none of the
   races identified from Yemen samples were identical to those in Syria and
   Lebanon. Virulence frequencies in the yellow rust population on the
   differential genotypes tested in the trap nurseries were above 70\% for
   some resistance genes. Yellow rust populations in Syria and Lebanon have
   diverse virulence phenotypes. P. striiformis populations appear to be
   changing over, and this would be an important consideration for wheat
   breeding programs in the region.}},

   finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) in the Inland Sea, which is
   believed to be inhabited by one local population of the species. Each
   survey lasted 2-24 days and covered nearly the entire extension of the
   sea. In principle, we followed the method of Kasuya and Kureha (1979)
   and attempted to revisit as many ferry tracks surveyed by them as
   possible, but we used a greater number of observers for some selected
   surveys and added some new tracks. Records of strandings and incidental
   mortality of the species were also analyzed. Comparison of the two sets
   of survey data, which were about 22 years apart, did not show
   establishment of new habitat in the Inland Sea, but confirmed
   disappearance of some habitat previously occupied by the species. All
   the 18 tracks surveyed by both studies showed various degrees of density
   decline, and the decline was statistically significant for 12 of them.
   The sighting rate (number of finless porpoises sighted per 100 km
   survey) declined in both nearshore and offshore strata. Using the 18
   tracks and combining all strata, we estimated that the current density
   was about 4\% that of the late 1970s in the middle and eastern Inland
   Sea, while it was about 70\% in the western Inland Sea. From these
   results, we conclude that the finless porpoise population in the Inland
   Sea has dramatically declined. This decline was consistent with the
   trends of strandings and mortalities in fishing gear. Entanglement in
   fishing nets is the only documented human-caused mortality for the
   population. However, the decline was probably a result of compound
   effects of various types of environmental degradation, including
   destruction of coastal habitats due to construction, chemical pollution,
   red tide and vessel traffic.}},

Abstract = {{On-going monitoring surveys are being conducted on a freshwater
   Irrawaddy dolphin population, locally referred to as the Pesut,
   inhabiting the Mahakam River in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The aim of
   the study is to provide detailed information on the abundance,
   distribution, and ecology relevant to conservation of this population.
   This paper describes results from surveys in February 1999 - July 2000
   that relate to population abundance estimates and compares different
   survey techniques. The primary goal of these investigations is to
   develop a conservation program for effective management of Indonesia's
   only freshwater dolphin population, which is considered to be critically
   endangered. In this study, both modified strip-transect and direct count
   survey-methods were employed. Total search effort in the Mahakam River
   amounted to 4260 km (397 hours). Results of eight sighting surveys
   indicate that the dolphins in the mainstream Mahakam range from 180 km
   above the mouth to 480 km upstream, seasonally inclusive of several
   tributaries and lakes. However, dolphins are reported to sporadically
   move as far down- and upstream as 80 km and 600 km, respectively. The
   distribution of the dolphins changes seasonally and is influenced by
   water levels and variation in prey availability. The middle Mahakam area
   (MMA) and tributaries between 180 km and 350 km upstream were identified
   as primary dolphin habitat, based on highest dolphin densities. Sighting
   rates calculated for medium water levels in the MMA in 1999 and 2000 are
   nearly similar (ca. 0.09 dolphins/km, CV=25\%, 49\%). Highest sighting
   rate for the MMA was recorded at low water levels (0.142 dolphins/ km,
   CV=51\%), indicating that dolphins are congregating in the main river in
   deeper waters. Lowest sighting rate was recorded at high water levels
   (0.035 dolphins/ km, CV=33\%), suggesting that dolphins have moved
   upstream into the tributaries. Total mean abundance-estimates, based on
   density estimates and direct counts, were both 34 dolphins. However, the
   mean estimate based on density estimates exhibited more variation
   (CV=25\%), than the mean direct count estimate with associated CV of
   5\%. Unless a modified density sampling technique has been developed
   that is appropriate to the river conditions and takes into account
   dolphins daily migrations between main river and tributaries, direct
   count studies seem a more useful tool for assessing abundance of this
   particular freshwater population.}},

Abstract = {{The response of the photosynthetic apparatus to high irradiance
   illumination (440-2200 W/m(2)) was studied in the diatom Thallassiosira
   weisflogii by fluorescence methods. Changes in the photosynthetic
   apparatus were monitored by measuring characteristics of chlorophyll
   fluorescence F(0), F(m), F(v)/F(m), and qN for several hours after
   illumination of the alga with high-intensity light. Incubation of the
   alga with 2 mM DTT, an inhibitor of de-epoxidase of carotenoids in the
   diadinoxanthin cycle, led to a decrease in the nonphotochemical
   quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and a drop in the F(v)/F(m) ratio,
   a characteristic that reflects the quantum efficiency of the functioning
   of the photosynthetic apparatus. Light-induced absorption changes
   associated with transformations of carotenoids of diadinoxanthin cycle
   were recorded in vivo in algal suspensions in the absence and in the
   presence of DTT. Using the microfluorometric method, we measured cell
   distribution over the efficiency of the primary processes of
   photosynthesis (F(v)/F(m)) after illumination. We found cells with a
   high tolerance of their photosynthetic apparatus to photooxidative
   damage. The relatively high tolerance of a portion of the cell
   population to high-light illumination can be related to light-induced
   transformation of carotenoids and to the functioning of other protective
   systems of the photosynthetic apparatus in diatoms.}},

Abstract = {{The year-round movements of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis were
   monitored in a large river (125 km) and brackish-water estuary by using
   radio and acoustic tags and a fish counting fence over a 3-year period.
   Trout moved upstream 65-100 km during the spring after ice loss over a
   protracted 4-month period (April-July). Summer movements were minimal,
   and habitats were deep pools and runs with cover in the same reaches
   each year. Trout moved short distances (<10 km) to spawning areas in the
   fall (September). Downstream movements were observed for both
   postspawned and immature trout. By the time of the river freeze-up
   (January), major movements had ceased and trout wintered in the lower to
   middle reaches of the main river, with only one trout leaving the river.
   That fish remained in habitats with salinity less than 5parts per
   thousand during winter and returned to the river by May. By improving
   the scale of observation, we identified an apparent mix of tactics
   related to the use of marine and freshwater environments within this
   population. Such behavior may have important implications for the
   ecological and evolutionary significance of mobility and anadromy within
   the species and the Salmoninae.}},

Abstract = {{The microbiology and the feasibility of a new, single-stage, reactor for
   completely autotrophic ammonia removal were investigated. The reactor
   was started anoxically after inoculation with biomass from a reactor
   performing anaerobic ammonia oxidation (Anammox). Subsequently, oxygen
   was supplied to the reactor and a nitrifying population developed.
   Oxygen was kept as the limiting factor. The development of a nitrifying
   population was monitored by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization and
   off-line activity measurements. These methods also showed that during
   steady state, anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria remained present and
   active. In the reactor, no aerobic nitrite-oxidizers were detected. The
   denitrifying potential of the biomass was below the detection limit.
   Ammonia was mainly converted to N(2) (85\%) and the remainder (15\%) was
   recovered as NO(3)(-). N(2)O production was negligible (less than
   0.1\%). Addition of an external carbon source was not needed to realize
   the autotrophic denitrification to N(2). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Stock enhancement is an attractive option for the management of
   fisheries but needs to be carefully evaluated before large-scale
   implementation. We advocate an experimental approach to test the
   hypothesis that reseeded stocks will yield greater harvests than
   unseeded controls. We tested the effectiveness of releasing
   hatchery-reared juveniles to enhance stocks of the topshell Trochus
   niloticus in Australia, Indonesia and Vanuatu using a rigorous design
   enabling direct comparisons among countries. Trochus were released at
   different sizes (6-12, 16-27 nun) and densities (2-8 m(2)) at replicated
   sites in each region. Populations at those sites were subsequently
   compared with those at unseeded controls. Temporal variation in success
   was also assessed by repeating the experiment in Indonesia. Initial
   survival was monitored by tagging the juveniles with aluminium foil and
   recapturing them using underwater metal detectors. The majority of
   juveniles released in Australia and Indonesia died or disappeared within
   a month of release and stocks were not enhanced relative to controls.
   Predation, especially by fish, was considered likely to be the most
   important cause of loss, but further investigation is required. Losses
   in Vanuatu were also substantial, but up to 4.4\% of 10-27 mm juveniles
   were recaptured alive after 12 months. Results froth Australia and
   Vanuatu suggested that survival may be improved by releasing juveniles
   in greater densities and at greater sizes. We discuss additional
   strategies for improving survival of free-released juveniles in Vanuatu
   and suggest alternative approaches for Australia and Indonesia. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Commercial ponds receiving two microbial products were monitored for
   changes in bacterial populations and shrimp production. Nine ponds of
   0.5 ha each were treated; three with microbial Product 1, three with
   Product 2 and three left untreated to serve as control ponds. The
   products were screened for species composition and administered
   following manufacturer's instructions throughout the culture period of I
   10 days. Product 1 contained Bacillus sp. and Saccharomyces sp. and
   Product 2 contained Bacillus sp., Nitrosomonas sp. and Nitrobacter sp.
   Water and sediment samples were collected once every 14 days for
   bacteriological analyses. Various heterotrophic (total plate count,
   presumptive vibrios, protein mineralising, ammonifying and sulphur
   reducing) and autotrophic (ammonia oxidising, nitrite oxidising,
   presumptive sulphur oxidising) bacterial groups were estimated for their
   population densities in water and sediment. Results showed that the
   Bacillus spp. were dominant in all ponds. Sediment of ponds treated with
   Product 1 had significantly higher (P < 0.05) number of total plate
   count (1.24 x 10(6) +/- 0.27 x 10(6) cfu g(-1)) and presumptive sulphur
   oxidising bacteria (1.01 x 10(2) +/- 0.19 x 10(2) cfu g(-1)). The
   average density of sulphur reducing bacteria (2.74 +/- 0.27 cfu ml(-1))
   in water of the control ponds was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than
   that from treated ponds. The average production at the end of the
   culture period was relatively, but not statistically higher in ponds
   treated with Product 1 (5837.14 +/- 715.22 kg ha(-1)) when compared with
   those for Product 2 (4877.42 +/- 438.46 kg ha(-1)) and control (5102.28
   +/- 262.28 kg ha(-1)) ponds. Some bacterial populations and feed
   conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly different in Product 1 ponds
   compared to others, but the economical returns were not statistically
   different between treatments. Further studies to show the benefits of
   using microbial products in commercial aquaculture farms should be
   conducted utilizing larger sample size. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V

Abstract = {{Serum manganese levels were determined in 250 healthy subjects (122 men
   and 128 women) living in Barcelona in northeastern Spain. The study was
   designed to assess the reference levels for serum manganese and to
   investigate its relationship to age and sex. The age distribution ranged
   from 15 to 90 years. The assays were performed by means of a graphite
   furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The geometric mean of serum
   manganese concentration was 1.1 mug/l, ranging from 0.3 mug/l to 2.5
   mug/l. In almost every case, the 95th upper percentiles of this element
   were < 1.8 mug/l. No correlation between the concentration of manganese
   and sex could be established, but in the younger population the
   manganese levels were nearly three times higher than the results
   obtained in the older population. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The native Eucalyptus leaf beetle Chrysophtharta bimaculata (Olivier)
   (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) has become a pest of the introduced,
   plantation species, Eucalyptus nitens Maiden in Tasmania, Australia.
   However, in the field it prefers to oviposit on the Tasmanian native
   species, E. regnans F. Muell. This laboratory study found that the
   performance of C. bimaculata larvae was superior on foliage of E. nitens
   compared with E. regnans . Larval development was 4 days shorter on E.
   nitens than on E. regnans foliage. Total food consumption per larva and
   relative consumption rates were about 30\% lower while relative growth
   rates and weight of emergent adults were more than 25\% higher on E.
   nitens than E. regnans . Efficiency of conversion (ECI) of fresh food
   into larval wet weight was 0.26 on E. nitens compared with 0.14 on E.
   regnans . Mortality of larvae feeding on E. nitens (23\%) was only one
   third of that on E. regnans (69\%), a result of high first instar
   mortality on E. regnans . Although the amount of foliage consumed per
   larva was lower on E. nitens (0.23 g vs 0.32 g), the differential
   mortality meant that the amount of E. nitens consumed per egg batch was
   60\% more than that of E. regnans . If these results occurred in the
   field, then the same monitored population of C. bimaculata eggs may
   result in heavier defoliation of plantation E. nitens than of E. regnans
   . These data show that the reported oviposition preference of C.
   bimaculata for E. regnans in the field cannot be explained by selection
   of host factors related to superior larval performance.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of major conifer and deciduous broad-leaved tree (DBL) species
   in an old-growth (ca. 300 years old) Chamaccyparis obtusa (Sieb. et
   Zucc.) Endlicher forest was monitored using stem mapping method for 10
   years (1988-1998) in a 4 ha permanent plot of the Akasawa Forest Reserve
   in central Japan. The plot was dominated by C obtusa, followed by
   Thujopsis dolabrata Sieb. et Zucc. and Chamaecyparis pisifera (Sieb. et
   Zucc.) Endlicher, which are evergreen conifers, and DBL species such as
   Quercus mongolica Fischer ex Turez., Magnolia obovata Thumb., and Betula
   grossa Sieb. et Zucc.. We focused the dynamics of steins greater than or
   equal to5 cm dbh (diameter at 1.3 m above ground) of these six major
   tree species. Out of 1443 stems ha(-1) of these species which were alive
   in 1988, 154 were dead and 67 new stems recruited during 10 years. The
   recruitment rate was lower than the mortality rate for the conifers, but
   the reverse was almost true for the DBL species; the rates of
   recruitment and mortality of C obtusa were 0.05 and 0.27\% yr(-1),
   respectively, and those of T dolabrata were 0.53 and 1.48\% yr(-1),
   respectively. The recruitment rate of conifers was clearly lower than
   that of DBL species. The basal area of the total six major tree species
   was 64.2 m(2) ha(-1) at the beginning and increased to 65.9 m(2) ha(-1)
   in 1998. The gain rate of basal area was higher than the loss rate for
   each of the conifers and the DBL species. The gain rate of M, obovata
   (2.26\% yr(-1)) and the loss rate of T dolabrata (0.77\% yr(-1)) were
   highest among major tree species. The mortality of stems was size
   dependent for all major tree species, which implies that smaller stems
   had higher mortality. Standing dead was first, especially for DBL
   species, and stem broken was next dominant state of the stem mortality.
   The recruitment and mortality of some species related to forest floor
   conditions or canopy gaps. The DBL species significantly recruited and
   died under canopy gaps, The mortality of some species depended on the
   local density of understory stems. These results clearly indicate that
   this old-growth forest has not still reached a equilibrium state. (C)

Abstract = {{Body mass is a key determinant of fitness components in many organisms,
   and adult mass varies considerably among individuals within populations.
   These variations have several causes, involve temporal and spatial
   factors, and are not yet well understood. We use long-term data from 20
   roe deer cohorts (1977-96) in a 2600 ha study area (Chize, western
   France) with two habitats contrasting in quality (rich oak forest in the
   North versus poor beech forest in the South) to analyse the effects of
   both cohort and habitat quality on adult mass (i.e. median body mass
   between 4 and 10 years of age) of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Cohort
   strongly influenced the adult body mass of roe deer in both sexes: males
   born in 1994 were 5.2 kg heavier when aged between 4 and 10 years old
   than males born in 1986, while females born in 1995 were 4.7 kg heavier
   between 4 and 10 years old than females born in 1982. For a given
   cohort, adult males were, on average, 0.9 kg heavier in the rich oak
   forest than in the poor beech forest. A similar trend occurred for adult
   females (0.5 kg heavier in the oak forest). The effects of cohort and
   habitat were additive and accounted for ca. 40\% of the variation
   observed in the adult mass of roe deer at Chize (males: 41.2\%; females:
   40.2\%). Population density during the spring of the birth accounted for
   about 35\% of cohort variation, whereas rainfall in May-June had no
   effect. Such delayed effects of density at birth on adult body mass
   probably affect population dynamics, and might constitute a mechanism by
   which delayed density-dependence occurs in ungulate populations.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have examined mercury accumulation in crocodilians.
   However, though most researchers have focused on tissue concentrations,
   few have examined mercury levels in crocodilian eggs. In July 1995, we
   analyzed mercury in 31 nonviable Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylits
   moreletii) eggs collected from eight nests across three localities in
   northern Belize. All eggs were found to contain mercury. Based on an
   individual egg basis, mean concentration of mercury for all three
   localities was among the lowest reported for any crocodilian species.
   When localities were examined separately, mean concentrations for Laguna
   Seca and Gold Button Lagoon were comparable to those observed in other
   studies, and the mean for Sapote Lagoon was the lowest ever reported.
   Based on mean nest concentrations, mercury in eggs from Laguna Seca was
   approximately two- and tenfold higher than for Gold Button Lagoon and
   Sapote Lagoon, respectively. Variability in mercury concentrations among
   localities is likely the result of site-specific differences in mercury
   input, bioavailabilty, and bioaccumulation. Mercury concentrations were
   relatively uniform in eggs from the same nest and among nests from the
   same localities. The presence of mercury in Morelet's crocodile eggs
   suggests exposure in adult females, developing embryos, and neonates.
   However, crocodiles in these areas show no overt signs of mercury
   toxicity, and no indication of population decline is evident. A paucity
   of data on the effects of mercury on crocodilians precludes meaningful
   speculation as C to the biological significance of tissue and egg
   concentrations. Controlled laboratory studies and long-term population
   monitoring are needed to address these questions.}},

Abstract = {{Under the Clean Air Act Amendments, the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency is required to regulate emissions of 188 hazardous air
   pollutants. The EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards is
   currently conducting a National-scale Air Toxics Assessment with a goal
   to identify air toxics which are of greatest concern, in terms of
   contribution to population inhalation risk. The results will be used to
   set priorities for the collection of additional air toxics emissions and
   monitoring data. Expanded ambient air toxics monitoring will take the
   form of a national air toxics monitoring network. With all monitoring
   data, however, comes uncertainty in the form of environmental
   variability (spatial and temporal) and monitoring error (sample
   collection and laboratory analysis). With this in mind, existing data
   from the Urban Air Toxics Monitoring Program (UATMP) were analyzed to
   obtain a general understanding of these sources of variability and then
   provide recommendations for managing the data uncertainties of a
   national network. The results indicate that environmental variability,
   in particular temporal, comprises most of the overall variability
   observed in the UATMP data. However, at lower ambient levels (on the
   order of 0.1-0.5 ppbv or lower) environmental variability tends to
   dissipate and monitoring error takes over, most notably analytical
   error. Overall, the results suggest that common techniques in ambient
   air toxics monitoring for carbonyls and volatile organic compounds may
   satisfy many of the primary objectives of a national air toxics
   monitoring network. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Current rural development policy encourages farmers to adopt
   multifunctional use of farmland. Non-agricultural resources such as
   wildlife provide a focus for recreational activities such as shooting
   and bird watching. This paper assesses the potential contribution of
   wild pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) management for shooting to the
   conservation of farmland passerines. Bird numbers were monitored over a
   7-year period on farmland in Leicestershire (England), in relation to
   the introduction of a game management system. Passerines were used as
   the indicator group as they are an official `quality of life' indicator,
   and include species that are the subject of government biodiversity
   action plans. Following introduction of the game management package,
   there was little change in species diversity at the farm scale, but
   species experiencing population declines nationally showed significant
   increases in numbers. The management of wild pheasants for shooting may
   therefore have considerable potential for the conservation of nationally
   declining farmland birds and for recreational activities such as bird
   watching.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Sarcocapnos DC., endemic to the western Mediterranean basin,
   contains seven species, all of which are rare. Monthly monitoring of the
   number and flowering status of individuals as well as the appearance of
   new seedlings in five populations of three species, Sarcocapnos baetica
   (Boiss. \& Reuter) Nyman, Sarcocapnos enneaphylla (L.) DC., and
   Sarcocapnos pulcherrima Morales \& Romero-Garcia, was conducted between
   July 1997 and June 1998. This monitoring was repeated in May 1999 and
   2000. Given the difficulty in establishing the age of individuals, those
   that did not produce flowers in the study period were considered
   juveniles, and reproductive individuals that wilted for no apparent
   external cause were deemed senescent. Sarcocapnos enneaphylla has a
   short life-span, early sexual maturity, and high seedling production.
   This combination appears to be highly effective, because the species is
   widely distributed geographically with many populations. In contrast, S.
   pulcherrima and S. baetica have longer life-spans, delayed sexual
   maturity, and lower production of seedlings. The low recruitment rate in
   these two species is offset by a long life expectancy among reproductive
   individuals, although this strategy apparently limits their capacity for
   geographical expansion. The equilibrium growth rate (lambda) varied
   markedly in S. enneaphylla populations (SE-1: lambda = 0.570 for
   1997-1998 to 1998-1999 and lambda = 1.226 for 1998-1999 to 1999-2000;
   SE-2: lambda = 0.832 for 1997-1998 to 1998-1999 and lambda = 1.135 for
   1998-1999 to 1999-2000) while in S. pulcherrima populations, lambda was
   very close to 1 (SP-1: lambda = 0.991 for 1997-1998 to 1998-1999 and
   lambda = 0.969 for 1998-1999 to 1999-2000; SP-2: lambda = 1.000 for
   1997-1998 to 1998-1999 and lambda = 1.101 for 1998-1999 to 1999-2000).
   In the S. baetica population, values varied between lambda = 0.971 for
   1997-1998 to 1998-1999 and lambda = 1.345 for 1998-1999 to 1999-2000. In
   the three species, an elasticity analysis of matrix projection models
   revealed that the elements with the greatest effect on population growth
   were those of reproductive plants remaining within the same reproductive
   class. In addition, in S. enneaphylla, seedlings had important weight
   for population growth. The fact that the reproductive stages are the
   most critical to population growth should be taken into account where
   protective or conservation action is required.}},

Abstract = {{A population of young blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) was
   monitored over three years to determine their mortality rates using a
   series of acoustic listening stations. Based on these data it was
   possible to use several mortality estimators, including indirect life
   history based methods and direct methods such as the Kaplan-Meier and
   SURVIV methods, to estimate natural, fishing, and total mortality.
   Kaplan-Meier (61-91\%) and SURVIV (62-92\%) methods provided nearly
   identical total mortality rates during the first six months of life.
   This agreement suggests that these estimates are accurate for this
   population. All natural and fishing mortality occurred within the first
   15 weeks of the study. This suggests that young sharks are most
   vulnerable to all types of mortality during this period. Sharks that
   survived beyond the first 15 weeks successfully left the nursery and
   were presumed to have migrated southward during fall months. These
   results provide critical information concerning the early life history
   of sharks and the importance of nursery areas to the survival of young
   animals.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of dioxins, dibenzofurans, and polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs) in human tissue, food, and environmental samples from Russia has
   been monitored since 1988 as part of a research collaboration between a
   number of countries including Finland, the United States, Germany, the
   former Soviet Union, and Canada. Although elevated TCDD and PnCDD levels
   have previously been found in blood of male and female Russian chemical
   manufacturing workers and in their children, dioxin levels in the
   general population have usually been found to be lower than in Americans
   and Europeans. This study continues earlier work in the Irkutsk region
   of Russian Siberia, where we report levels of dioxin, dibenzofurans, and
   PCBs in human milk samples taken from general population women living in
   the industrialized cities of Angarsk and Usolye-Sibirskoye, near Lake
   Baikal. Total polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) toxic equivalents
   (TEQs) compared in this paper for the industrialized regions of Siberia,
   Ukraine, and the US are similar, ranging from 6.1 to 7 parts per
   trillion (ppt). Recent 1998 milk samples from Angarsk and
   Usolye-Sibirskoye have total mean polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF)
   TEQs of 10 and 21.7 ppt, respectively, with the other industrialized
   countries ranging from 2.3 to 6.7 ppt. Although dioxin-like PCBs were
   not measured for the city of Usolye-Sibirskoye (1998), total mean PCDD/F
   TEQ from Angarsk and Usolye-Sibirskoye (1998) were the two highest
   levels in this study, with 26.9 and 28.5 ppt, respectively, followed by
   1993-1994 Ukraine samples with 24 ppt, 1989 Siberian samples with 13.6
   ppt, and 1996 USA with 11.4 ppt total TEQ. In this study, higher levels
   of dioxins are noted in milk from Angarsk and Usolye-Sibirskoye than
   found in earlier Russian studies, with mean levels also exceeding 1996
   and 1999 US breast milk dioxin levels. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Land use planners have the challenge of incorporating biologically sound
   guidelines into development plans to balance human development with
   conservation of natural resources. Valued as an important component of
   the natural heritage of the northeastern United States, anadromous river
   herring (Alosa pseudoharengus, A. aestivalis) represent a model system
   to look at how ecological data can help conserve biological diversity in
   systems impacted by humans. Juvenile river herring spend 3-7 months in
   freshwater then migrate to the ocean. However, factors that trigger
   migration, and consequently influence distribution and abundance, are
   not well understood. Thus, our objectives in this study were to (1)
   describe juvenile river herring migration patterns, both ``peak{''}
   (>1000 fish/wk) and ``all{''} (>30 fish/wk) migration; (2) identify
   potential cues for this migration; (3) examine effects of one, type of
   ecosystem alteration, low water levels, on river herring; and (4)
   suggest how this information can be incorporated into an effective
   conservation plan. Weekly during June-November 1994, we sampled both
   migrating and nonmigrating river herring and seven associated abiotic
   and biotic variables in one continuous and one intermittent flow system
   on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. We then used multiple logistic regression to
   predict when juvenile river herring migrate. In the continuous-flow
   system, juvenile river herring migration primarily occurred during the
   midday hours from July through early November, with the peaks of
   migration, comprising >96\% of all migrating fish observed in early July
   and early September.. The peaks of migration occurred during the new
   moon, when Bosmina spp. density was low, and all periods of migration
   occurred when water visibility was low, during decreased amounts of
   rainfall. In the intermittent flow system, juvenile river herring
   migration was frequently inhibited due to low water levels, and herring
   were on average 25 mm smaller than those in the continuous flow system.
   Using these results, managers can more effectively monitor river herring
   populations by identifying factors associated with migration and
   isolating critical flow periods when fish movement is likely to occur.
   Thus, we can detect changes in herring population size due to human
   impacts. Ultimately, these data can be incorporated into an ecologically
   sound conservation plan for juvenile anadromous herring that may help
   ensure their survival while balancing human needs for natural resources.}},

Abstract = {{During the past 50 yr, ecological and agricultural scientists have
   pursued an integrated definition and metric of soil quality. In the past
   20 yr, considerable attention has been paid to nematodes, demonstrating
   that these ubiquitous members of the soil community reflect change in
   ecological structure and function of soils in ways more predictable and
   efficient than for other soil flora or fauna. With the help of
   multivariate analysis, we studied the application of free-living
   nematode communities as model indicators of physical and chemical
   disturbance of agricultural soil. We used canonical correspondence
   analysis (CCA) and partial CCA to segregate effects of tillage and
   chemical/nutrient treatments. With the results of CCA, we assigned
   relative direct and indirect tillage sensitivity and chemical/nutrient
   sensitivity ratings to soil genera found in two test data sets, each
   containing three matrices: (1) sites by species or genera, (2) sites by
   soil properties, and (3) sites by management practices. Of 46 total
   genera, the ones most sensitive to direct effects of tillage include
   Aphelenchoides, Eucephalobus, Eudorylaimus, Heterocephalobus, and
   Wilsonema compared to the tolerant genera Achromadora, Anatonchus,
   Cephalobus, Chiloplacus, Clarkus, Epidorylaimus, Mylonchulus, Plectus,
   and Tylencholaimellus. Some genera are more sensitive to indirect than
   direct effects of tillage: these include Achromadora, Cephalobus,
   Microdorylaimus, Monhystera, Panagrolaimus, and Prionchulus. With the
   exception of Discolaimus and Prismatolaimus, genera sensitive to
   chemical/nutrient treatments differ from those sensitive to tillage
   treatments including Alaimus, Cylindrolaimus, Mesorhabditis,
   Odontolaimus, and Protorhabditis. Likewise, genera uniquely sensitive to
   indirect but not direct effects of chemical/nutrient treatments are
   Aphelenchus, Aporcelaimellus. and Diplogaster. Eudorylaimus and
   Eumonhsytera are sensitive to indirect effects of both tillage and
   chemical/nutrient treatments. Our results suggest that physical and
   chemical/nutrient disturbances can alter populations of nematode genera
   differently, and that indirect effects of management are greater than
   direct effects. This methodology aids in distinguishing nematode genera
   that have distinctive responses to agricultural management practices
   from those that are ambiguous. This knowledge is useful for both
   interpretation and enhancement of free-living nematode community
   indices.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites are ubiquitous, but widely neglected, components of food webs.
   Because of their trophic position, parasites may have major direct and
   indirect effects on community structure. Because the magnitude of these
   effects is likely to depend on parasite density, this study was
   undertaken to explore temporal patterns in the density of parasites and
   the processes responsible for those patterns. Parasitism by Howardula
   nematodes was monitored in four species of mycophagous Drosophila (D.
   falleni, D. neotestacea, D. putrida, and D. recens) that were sampled
   monthly from 1984 through 1998 near Rochester, New York, USA. Adult
   flies were collected by sweep netting over naturally occurring mushrooms
   or commercial Agaricus bisportis mushrooms that had been set out as
   baits. These adults were then dissected to determine whether they were
   parasitized by Howardula nematodes.
   The prevalence of parasitism varied substantially among species, being
   greatest in D. neotestacea (23.0\% infected) and least in D. recens
   (4.8\%). Parasitism was greatest in the spring and fall, and least in
   midsummer. Prevalence of parasitism covaried significantly through time
   among the three principal host species, D. falleni, D. neotestacea, and
   D. putrida, in part because the different species often breed in the
   same individual mushrooms, the site where nematode transmission from
   adult flies to larvae occurs. The mean prevalence of parasitism across
   these three species at the end of the season (September) was
   significantly correlated with the total precipitation from May through
   August. The mean prevalence of parasitism in the spring collections was
   significantly correlated with the mean prevalence the previous fall,
   because flies overwinter as adults. Consequently, the mean prevalence of
   parasitism in spring was highly correlated with May through August
   precipitation the previous year. It is hypothesized that rainfall, which
   stimulates the production of mushrooms (the flies' breeding sites),
   interacts with density-dependent nematode transmission to influence the
   prevalence of parasitism in these populations.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental manipulation of germination timing was conducted to test
   whether germination timing influences the phenotypic expression of
   postgermination life-P history characteristics and whether it alters
   natural selection on those characters. Seeds collected from five natural
   populations of Arabidopsis thaliana in Kentucky were forced to germinate
   in early November, early December, and early March. Life-history
   characters such as timing of reproduction. size at reproduction, and
   size at senescence were measured, and fruit production and mortality
   were monitored. Germination timing significantly altered subsequent
   life-history characters and reproduction. November germinants were
   larger than December germinants when they began reproducing, and they
   commenced reproduction sooner. All spring germinants died before
   reproducing. Germination timing also influenced natural selection on
   life-history characters. December germinants were more strongly selected
   to be large at the time of reproduction than November germinants,
   indicating stronger selection for a faster growth rate in December
   germinants. Stabilizing selection on timing of reproduction was detected
   in December germinants but not in November germinants. Therefore.
   variation in germination timing influenced fitness, modified the
   phenotypic expression of important life-history characters, and altered
   the strength and mode of natural selection on them.}},

Abstract = {{The overall objective of this research was to monitor the uptake
   kinetics of lead in an amphibian model and correlate metal content with
   embryo development. Based upon the concentration of lead found in the
   water and sediment of a Louisiana swamp adjacent to a Superfund site, a
   controlled laboratory experiment exploring lead uptake from water and
   sediment by Xenopus laevis tadpoles was conducted. For 5 weeks, tadpoles
   were exposed to water and a simulated sediment, kaolin, spiked with 1,
   5, or 10 times the concentration of lead found in field water and
   sediment samples. Additionally, organisms were exposed to the 5 x
   condition for 3 and 6 weeks. The experimental controls consisted of
   unexposed tadpoles and ones exposed to lead originating from water or
   sediment exclusively. At the end of the exposure periods, developmental
   data, i.e., body weight and developmental stage, were recorded, and the
   tadpoles were analyzed for whole body lead concentration. Lead
   extraction was accomplished by dry ashing, and its amount was quantified
   polarographically. Results showed that lead inhibited the normal
   development of these amphibians, in a manner that generally was more
   severe as exposure level increased. The hindrance of tadpole development
   also coincided with an increase in whole body lead concentration at
   higher exposures. Temporally, at the 5 x exposure concentration, the
   mean lead level increased with time, but this difference was not
   statistically significant (P<.05). Additionally, control animals exposed
   to lead (either in water or in sediment) showed no statistical
   difference with regard to weight and lead uptake, indicating that lead
   originating from both water and sediment is incorporated into the
   tadpole. The controlled laboratory experimental protocol used here is
   thus capable of investigating the uptake of a single metal (Pb in this
   case) and determining its effect on the development of tadpoles while
   differentiating the significance. of multiple sources of exposure. (C)

Abstract = {{Tomicus piniperda (L.), a Eurasian scolytid first discovered in North
   America in 1992, is established in at least 12 north central and
   northeastern states and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
   The expanding range of T piniperda, its ability to develop and
   shoot-feed in most North American pine species, and its relatively early
   spring activity have generated questions about its potential
   interactions with native competitors and natural enemies. Our objectives
   were to compare phenology of T piniperda with native phloem-feeding
   insects and to evaluate phenological synchrony between T. piniperda and
   native predators in red pine forest stands. We monitored adult beetle
   activity using baited funnel traps and observations of insect activity
   on freshly cut red pine logs in four to eight stands in southwestern and
   northern lower Michigan during two field seasons. Logs were periodically
   returned to the laboratory and individually caged. Phloem-feeders,
   predators and parasitoids emerging from logs were identified. Tomicus
   piniperda was collected only in southwestern stands and was consistently
   the first scolytid collected in funnel traps. Ten native phloem-feeding
   species were collected in funnel traps or reared from logs; at least two
   native species were actively colonizing logs concommitently with T
   piniperda in early spring. We observed adults of the predatory clerid
   Thanasimus dubius (F.) actively moving on logs and preying on T
   piniperda adults and other scolytids early in spring, roughly 3-4 A
   before this species was first collected in funnel traps. Other native
   scolytid predators including Cucujus clavipes F. and three staphylinids
   were also active early in spring. Results suggests that T piniperda is
   likely to encounter interspecific competitors and natural enemies in
   North America, but further research will be needed to demonstrate how
   these interactions affect T piniperda population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{We found that variation in temperature and humidity significantly
   affected mortality rates and population dynamics of the spittlebug Deois
   flavopicta Stal by monitoring cohorts of diapausing eggs and nymphs for
   three generations. Cohorts of quiescent eggs, when exposed to increasing
   periods of high moisture (free water), produced higher proportions of
   eggs resuming embryonic development in laboratory experiments. The
   accumulated number of eggs resuming development as a function of (lays
   of exposure to moist conditions was modeled using a 0 distribution.
   Periods of drought and high temperatures after the beginning of
   postdiapause development increased embryonic and nymphal mortality.
   Mortality was modeled with a linear function, and in combination with
   the development model allowed the simulation of varying mortality rates
   in the newly emerged nymphal population. Comparisons with field data
   demonstrated a close fit to the observed and expected proportion of
   nymphs hatching daily. By accurately simulating natural mortality,
   hatching distribution and population dynamics, the model promises to be
   useful for managing the spittlebug in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Dicyplus hesperus Knight has good potential as a biological control
   agent for greenhouse pests in greenhouse tomato crops, The spatial
   distribution of D. hesperus was studied and a sampling plan was
   developed to monitor this species in green house-grown tomatoes. Adults
   and nymphs are distributed in a more aggregated pattern among plants
   than within plants. The strong, significant relationship between the
   mean population density and the proportion of occupied sample units
   (leaves or plants) makes it possible to use a binomial or
   presence-absence sampling approach. Presence-absence sampling is an
   efficient method for crop management purposes because less time is
   needed to process the samples compared with a method where all insects
   are counted. At high densities, considering a sample unit to be occupied
   only when there are more than a determined number of individuals reduces
   considerably the optimum sample size required.}},
