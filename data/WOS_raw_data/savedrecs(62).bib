Abstract = {{Populations of gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacilli,
   pseudomonads, and total bacteria were monitored on leaves of the
   tropical pasture legume Stylosanthes scabra cv. Fitzroy showing
   different severity levels of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum
   gloeosporioides. Leaves were either disease-free or were grouped on the
   basis of percentage of leaf area visibly diseased into low-, moderate-,
   and high-severity classes. Data on bacterial populations, collected on
   nine different occasions during a growing season, were analyzed with the
   population estimates as dependent variables and anthracnose severity
   class as the treatment. Meteorological variables were summarized using
   the maximum likelihood factor analysis and used as covariates. Of the
   three bacterial groups, only the spore-forming bacilli showed a
   statistically significant negative relationship between their population
   density and anthracnose severity. Total bacterial populations were
   assessed independently and also tended to rise with increasing disease
   severity. This suggested a possible antagonism of spore forming bacilli
   toward the anthracnose pathogen. A simple in vitro method for
   differentiating modes of antagonism was developed. Twenty-four bacterial
   isolates collected from the leaf surface were tested using this method;
   of these, 19 showed a degree of antagonism. The method proved incapable
   of differentiating between modes of antagonism. Further work is
   necessary to establish the nature and effectiveness of this putative
   antagonism. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclodiene insecticide resistance persists in field populations of
   Drosophila spp. at a frequency of approximately 1\% (0.01), despite the
   withdrawal of most cyclodiene type insecticides except endosulfan.
   However, we have previously documented that resistance-associated amino
   acid replacements in the gene Rdl, a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor,
   can significantly affect several channel functions of the integral
   chloride ionophore. We were therefore interested in investigating if
   different resistance-associated replacements confer significant fitness
   disadvantages and whether the use of endosulfan could be maintaining
   selection for cyclodiene resistance in the field. Using PCR
   amplification of specific alleles (PASA) within 3000 individual flies,
   we report that neither the alanine302 > serine (allele I) replacement in
   Drosophila melanogaster Meigen nor the alanine302 > serine (allele I) or
   alanine302 > glycine (allele 2) replacements in D. simulans Sturtevant
   showed any reduction in frequency in cage experiments nm for one year in
   the laboratory in the absence of selection. Further, repeated
   applications of endosulfan selected significantly for cyclodiene
   resistance in the field. Thus the apparent absence of fitness cost,
   combined with the continued use of endosulfan, may maintain cyclodiene
   resistance at this relatively high frequency in field populations.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of a previously unexploited group of snowy grouper,
   Epinephelus niveatus, was monitored from June 1985-April 1986. The study
   area was located in Onslow Bay, off the central North Carolina coast.
   Snowy grouper dominated (>90\%) the catches from the newly found reef
   and from other deepwater reefs in Onslow Bay. Catch rates, by weight,
   and mean size of fish taken from the newly discovered site were
   initially very high (67 kg . drop(-1) and 8.4 kg . fish(-1),
   respectively), but rapidly converged to values (7 kg . drop(-1) and 3.7
   kg . fish(-1)) comparable to other previously exploited reefs. Larger
   fish had a higher probability of being caught. The newly found site was
   fished intensively for less than 3 mo, removing 3\% of the population
   daily. The estimates of initial exploitable biomass ranged from
   29.2-30.8 t (eviscerated weight), at a density of approximately 11 kg .
   m(-2). By early August, over 60\% of the exploitable biomass had been
   removed, and the site could no longer support exclusive fishing during a
   trip; within a year over 80\% had been removed. The newly discovered
   site contributed over 30\% of the total amount of snowy grouper landed
   in North Carolina in 1985.}},

Abstract = {{The population dynamics of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis
   (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), were documented on potatoes grown in
   Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.) from 1990 to 1992. By comparing degree-day
   accumulations above 10 degrees C, both first occurrence and peak flights
   of male adults occurred earlier than elsewhere in North America. Because
   potatoes in P.E.I. are attacked earlier and over a longer period of time
   than potatoes grown in other regions, the insect is an important pest of
   potatoes in P.E.I. The correlation between peak numbers of male adults
   caught in pheromone traps and egg masses on potato plants was not
   significant (p = 0.22). However, the correlation between egg masses per
   potato stalk and larvae per potato stalk was significant (p = 0.003).
   Trapping adults and monitoring potato plants for the presence of egg
   masses during the period from 250 to 500 degree-days appears to be a
   reliable way to determine the presence of adults and the potential
   impact of larvae on yield of potatoes.}},

   Quebec/Vermont. Our objective was to evaluate hypotheses linking diel
   vertical movements of fish with light levels. Smelt distributions were
   also monitored from June through October (1988 and 1990) to evaluate
   seasonal changes in their behavior. A strong relationship (r(2) = 0.83)
   between ambient light intensities and the upper fish layer in the water
   column was observed. Fish depth was also related to the depth of the
   thermocline during the night and when surface water temperatures were
   >18 degrees C. The most characteristic feature was the strong avoidance
   of light levels >0.1 mu W/cm(2). However, we found considerable
   variation in lower light levels experienced by the whole fish
   population. The results suggest that existing models of anti-predation
   behavior relating light and fish depth are consistent, with some
   limitations, with patterns of diel vertical migration in rainbow smelt.}},

Abstract = {{Trask River juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) rear in
   an estuarine environment, whereas Rogue River juveniles rear in a
   riverine environment, suggesting these populations differ in the
   ontogeny of smelting physiology. To study differences in the onset of
   salinity tolerance between these populations, I reared individuals from
   the Trask and Rogue rivers (Oregon) in a common environment and
   monitored changes in their physiology throughout their first 5-6 months.
   Trask fish were able to tolerate oceanic salinities at a smaller size
   and younger age than Rogue juveniles. Fifty days post-first feeding and
   at <2 g 65\% of Trask juveniles survived in 32 ppt compared with 40\% of
   Rogue juveniles. Trask juveniles also maintained their water balance in
   32 ppt seawater relative to freshwater at 50 days post-first feeding
   compared with 80 days for Rogue juveniles. Plasma sodium concentration
   indicated that both populations did not competently osmoregulate until
   approximately 108 days post-first feeding. Although the minimum size and
   age of salinity tolerance depended on which indicator of tolerance was
   chosen for study, physiological parameters suggested interpopulational
   differences in the timing of the onset of salinity tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{In 1987 the UK Government banned the use of tributyl tin (TBT)-based
   antifouling paints on small boats of less than 25 m. Following initial
   control measures taken in 1986, a program of research was started to
   monitor concentrations of TBT residues in estuarine waters and sediments
   and to observe faunistic changes in highly contaminated estuaries. As
   part of this program, the size-frequency and abundance of Littorina
   littorea populations have been recorded in the estuaries of the rivers
   Crouch (Essex) and Hamble (Hampshire). Since the TBT ban, the
   concentration of TBT residues in water and sediments has been steadily
   declining. In both L. littorea populations, the frequency of O-group
   individuals has increased markedly, and there has been a simultaneous
   decrease in TBT residues in L. littorea tissues. Furthermore, plankton
   surveys of the River Crouch show that the numbers of L. littorea eggs
   and veliger larvae have progressively increased, suggesting that TBT may
   have impaired periwinkle reproduction and/or survival of the eggs and
   larvae. Subsequent laboratory experiments have indeed shown that reduced
   egg production was the probable mechanism of action, but the imposer
   associated with exposure to TBT in dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus) has not
   been seen.}},

Abstract = {{Pieces (600 mm x 800 mm) of coloured board, plastic sheeting and woven
   materials, placed beneath water traps prevented the traps from becoming
   soiled during rainy weather. Such backgrounds are not recommended for
   use with traps for monitoring populations of the cabbage root fly (Delia
   radicum L. - Diptera:Anthomyiidae), however, as, instead of increasing
   trap catch they reduced the numbers of female flies caught by 70\%-90\%.
   The main effect was that the visually attractive stimuli from the
   introduced backgrounds competed with those from the trap. A white
   background competed with a white trap on a direct fly/unit area basis.
   Green backgrounds stimulated males to land and the vertical stems of
   both real and artificial grass induced trivial flights that resulted in
   greater numbers of males entering traps resting on short grass. Most
   females were caught over bare soil. To minimize the variation in catch
   between traps used for monitoring cabbage root fly populations, the
   background beneath each trap should be similar. For maximum capture, the
   background should be of grass for male flies and of bare soil for female
   flies. Care is required if data from traps within mulched crops are used
   to make pest control decisions, as they will underestimate considerably
   the numbers of flies in such crops.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophone recordings were made to document the daily and seasonal
   cycles of weakfish, Cynoscion regalis (Sciaenidae), sound production in
   the Delaware Bay. Recordings were made at three stations perpendicular
   to the shore and rated qualitatively on a scale of 0-4. `Drumming'
   (sonic muscles, males only) and `chattering' (pharyngeal stridulation,
   both sexes) were tallied separately. Weakfish were collected from the
   field throughout the spring and summer to monitor the reproductive
   status of the population. A clear seasonal trend was noted in both
   drumming and chattering activities. Drumming activity rose abruptly in
   mid-May to maximal levels, which were maintained through late June, then
   dropped off in July and ceased in August. Chattering activity began
   abruptly in late June, then rose through July and remained high in
   August. Seasonal drumming activity was more intense at the inshore
   station. On a daily scale, drumming activity was at its lowest level
   during the early to mid-morning, then increased to maximal levels in the
   early evening and remained high until the following morning. There was
   no daily trend in chattering activity. Daily drumming activity was also
   most intense at the inshore station. Male and female reproductive
   readiness, determined by gonadosomatic indices, sperm motility and
   plasma androgen levels, peaked within the period of maximal seasonal

Abstract = {{Paralysis caused by feeding female Ixodes rubicundus ticks is a major
   problem in large areas of South Africa. As the life cycle of the tick
   extends over a period of 2 years, it was hypothesized that strategic
   treatment of sheep with an acaricide over a 2 year period, timed to kill
   most engorging females, should markedly lower the biotic potential of
   the tick. Two flocks of sheep grazing in separate paddocks known to be
   infested with I. rubicundus were treated either strategically or on a
   threshold basis (i.e. only when tick challenge exceeded a predetermined
   critical level in terms of paralysis) for a 2 year period. The tick
   burdens of untreated control sheep running with the two hocks were
   monitored over a 4 year period and their seasonal dynamics determined.
   The times at which peak infestations occurred were similar for both
   hocks of sheep, but significant differences in mean tick burdens between
   the two flocks were recorded. Tick numbers on sheep in the strategically
   treated flock did not decrease during the third and fourth years of the
   trial as was expected. Possible reasons for this were low stocking
   densities, especially during times of peak abundance of adults and the
   presence of wild hosts which maintained tick populations.}},

Abstract = {{Six honey bee colonies hived in Langstroth nuclei were each artificially

   was inspected every 3-4 days. The adult Varroa mites were compared with
   mounted specimens and catalogued into lightly pigmented and darkly
   pigmented females. After 4 months, an acaricide treatment was used to
   estimate the final mite population. Based on Light and dark adult
   counts, we propose a balancing equation that follows the Varroa
   population increase at 7 day intervals and allows the calculation of
   experimental population growth rates. The calculated Varroa finite rate
   of increase is lambda = 1.021. Exponential and logistic growth models
   fitted to the balancing equation data gave R(2) = 0.986 and R(2) =
   0.991, respectively. To develop a more precise model it would be
   necessary to follow the population growth beyond our experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the power of point data (collected systematically at each
   meter along a permanently-situated, 100-m line transect) to detect
   actual changes in plant basal cover, we developed a computational
   approach whereby a simplified shortgrass steppe community was spatially
   simulated on a computer screen. Cover was then reduced using a random
   disturbance pattern. One transect could detect an actual decrease in
   cover from 12\% to 8\% with less than 20\% probability, while 5
   transects increased this power to about 80\% (P less than or equal
   to.05). A reduction in cover from 12 to 6\% could be detected with 80\%
   probability with only 2 transects, while a cover reduction to 10\% could
   only be detected with 40\% probability using 10 transects (P less than
   or equal to.05). Artificial populations provide a valuable mechanism for
   quantitatively evaluating field sampling designs.}},

Abstract = {{Winter movements of four adult northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis)
   that nest in southcentral Wyoming were monitored during the winter of
   1992-93. Goshawks initiated fall migrations in early fall (primarily
   mid-September) while weather conditions are moderate. Female 1 migrated
   185 km south of her nest. She wintered in a mountainous area in Colorado
   at a higher elevation (2774 m) than her nest site (2500 m elevation).
   Male 1 migrated approximately 65 km west southwest of his nest before he
   was killed by a hard blow from a blunt object. This strike may have been
   caused by another raptor or a collision with the ground. Both Female 2
   and Male 2 migrated in a southerly direction from their nests. They were
   located approximately 140 km and 70 km, respectively, from their nests
   before both birds were lost during inclement weather. All birds returned
   to their nests from wintering areas between 23 March to 12 April.
   Results from this study suggest to wildlife managers that some goshawk
   populations in the Rocky Mountains are migratory; efforts to manage this
   species need to consider both wintering and nesting habitat
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{The economic development activities of an increasing world population
   threaten the assimilative capacity of our environment and have
   stimulated interest in the concept of environmental carrying capacity. 
   While the pace of land transformations has encouraged the refinement of
   information technologies such as satellite remote sensing to provide a
   synoptic view of earth-system processes, the volume of information these
   systems generate and the high level of expertise required to translate
   these data retard effective and timely land-management decision making. 
   This paper introduces a methodology that employs an artificial neural
   network trained to recognize categories of population support capacity
   from satellite data acquired from the NOAA-AVHRR.  The network,
   functioning as an `intelligent' mapping tool, achieved a clasification
   accuracy of 77.5 per cent for the study site and points to the potential
   role a model of this type may play in land degradation monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic enzymes of a multiresistant (i.e., carbamate,
   organophosphate, pyrethroid) population of tobacco budworm, Heliothis
   virescens (F.), were compared with those of a susceptible population.
   The resistant Hebert population, collected from areas where control
   failures with cypermethrin and thiodicarb had been reported, was
   selected in the laboratory with thiodicarb for seven generations.
   Resistance ratios as determined by topical bioassays were 91- and
   >150-fold to cypermethrin and thiodicarb, respectively.
   Resistance-associated increases in metabolism were found in fifth instar
   larvae for monooxygenases, carboxylester hydrolases, and glutathione
   transferases. Cytochrome P450 content was elevated in microsomes from
   gut (3.7-fold), fat body (4.4-fold), and carcass (4-fold). Monooxygenase
   activity varied substantially among the four substrates and three tissue
   sources examined. For three monooxygenase substrates (p-nitroanisole,
   benzo(a)pyrene, and benzphetamine) increases in metabolism varied from
   3- to 33-fold. The greatest increases in metabolism were observed with
   methoxyresorufin, in which increases were observed in all three tissues
   (23-, 29-, and 58-fold in fat body, midgut, and carcass microsomes,
   respectively). Significant increases ranging from 3- to 5-fold were
   observed for two esterase substrates, while smaller differences of up to
   2-fold were observed for a glutathione transferase substrate. The high
   metabolic activity of the resistant population suggested that
   homogenates of individual larvae might be used in resistance monitoring.
   The development of a monooxygenase-based microtiter plate assay using
   p-nitroanisole as substrate clearly discriminates between resistant and
   susceptible individuals in the third instar, suggesting that biochemical
   resistance monitoring can be carried out with field-collected
   individuals. The esterase substrate p-nitrophenyl acetate also may be a
   useful tool for resistance monitoring. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

   disadvantages and potential applications of each of these techniques are
   discussed and compared to the use of insecticide bioassays. It is
   concluded that, although such techniques will probably never replace

Abstract = {{Benzimidazole fungicides are important mixture components in strategies
   to combat fungicide resistance in Rhynchosporium secalis Davis. To
   monitor the performance of these strategies, a rapid, accurate assay has
   been developed to detect point mutations in the beta-tubulin gene which
   confers resistance of benzimidazoles. The beta-tubulin gene of a
   benzimidazole-resistant strain of R. secalis has been cloned and
   sequenced. Except for the difference in the position of one of its six
   introns, this gene showed a strong homology with other beta-tubulin
   genes from filamentous fungi. Resistance was related to a point mutation
   in codon 198 which caused a glutamic acid to glycine change in resistant
   field strains, but glutamic acid to lysine in a laboratory mutant. A DNA
   fragment surrounding codon 198 was amplified directly from diseased
   lesions using a `nested' set of PCR primers. Combining PCR
   amplificiation of a target DNA sequence with hybridization of
   Allele-Specific Oligonucleotide probes (ASOs, 15-mers) allowed accurate
   detection of benzimidazole resistance. Only two probes, one sensitive
   and one resistant, were sufficient to monitor current field populations.
   Detection was achieved using either P-32-labelled probe, or
   non-radioactively using a biotin-labelled probe coupled to
   streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase. This rapid method using ASOs can
   detect benzimidazole resistance within 48 h compared with 6-8 weeks by
   conventional assay procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Whole nematode communities, extracted from soil samples taken from
   agricultural fields, were enumerated by taxonomic family and trophic
   group (i.e., bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores, plant-parasites, and
   predators) to evaluate nematode community structure as an indicator for
   monitoring ecological condition of soil. No differences were found in
   mixing treatments or methods of packing or shipping samples. However,
   extraction using Cobb's sifting and gravity method, followed by sucrose
   centrifugation, gave greater recovery of free-living nematodes than
   elutriation followed by sucrose centrifugation. Population means and
   variance of the sampled area were similar when sampled using different
   strategies for collecting soil samples within fields, including several
   patterns, directions and repetitions of transects. Components of
   variation associated with ratios among the five trophic groups of
   nematodes and selected indices of community structure were quantified as
   variation among regions, among counties, among agricultural fields (2-ha
   area), among transects within agricultural fields, and within composite
   soil samples. The variance component for `within composite soil samples'
   was relatively large compared to the other components of variance.
   Variation within composite soil samples was less for maturity indices
   (based on life-history strategy characteristics), ratio of bacterivores
   to plant-parasites, sum of bacterivores and fungivores, populations of
   plant-parasites, and populations of bacterivores than for trophic
   diversity indices, populations of fungivores, populations of omnivores,
   populations of predators, or the ratio of fungivores to bacterivores.
   With a single composite sample per field, the ability to differentiate
   ecological condition of soils among fields within a region improved if
   the variance among and within fields exceeded the variance within
   composite samples. Given the variance components, power curves indicated
   that detection of a 10\% change (with 0.8 power) in the ecological
   condition of soils within a region between two time periods would
   require sampling a minimum of 25 and 50 fields with one composite soil
   sample analyzed per field for the maturity and trophic diversity index,
   respectively. More than 100 fields per region would be required to
   detect temporal change in populations of individual trophic groups.
   Biplots of maturity indices, but not of trophic diversity or populations
   of individual trophic groups, identified clear differences among fields.
   Thus, maturity indices, which differentiated among sampling sites better
   and more efficiently than trophic diversity indices or measures based on

Abstract = {{Three species of root aphid (Pachypappa vesicalis Koch, Pachypappa
   tremulae L. and Prociphilus (Stagona) xylostei De Geer) were found
   feeding on Norway spruce {[}Picea abies (L.) Karsten] that were exposed
   to elevated concentrations of O-3 and/or SO2 in a field manipulation
   experiment al Liphook, England. The experiment exposed conifer trees to
   controlled concentrations of these gases between 1987 and 1990.
   Root-aphid populations feeding on Norway spruce were monitored in autumn
   1990, the third year of fumigation and in autumn 1991, 10 months after
   fumigation had ceased. In 1990 the numbers of aphids in the high-SO2,
   high-SO2 + O-3 and O-3 treatments were significantly less than in
   ambient plots. Although after fumigation had ceased in 1991 the ambient
   plots still had higher numbers than the treatment plots, most of these
   differences were no longer statistically significant. In all plots
   sampled, total numbers of root aphids were higher in 1991 than in 1990.
   These results indicate that the numbers of root aphids in the experiment
   were negatively related to pollution levels. This relationship is the
   same as that shown in controlled laboratory experiments and is the
   converse of that generally reported in experiments using shoot-feeding
   aphids.}},

   observations over the period February 1989-December 1991.  Principal
   component analysis (PCA) was used in an attempt to describe the
   structure of relations between the solutes in wet deposition.  Some
   extensions of PCA (interstructure-compromise-intrastructure method) were
   considered in order to evaluate differences between relation structures
   as defined by location, season and volume of precipitations.}},

Abstract = {{Two plant washing techniques were compared for efficiency of extraction
   of thrips (primarily Frankliniella fusca (Hinds)) and cotton aphids,
   Aphis gossypii Glover, from seedling cotton. The techniques included a
   plant washing method previously reported and a modification of this
   procedure that included centrifugal flotation. Both techniques were
   equally effective in extraction of insects from plants grown in a clay
   loam soil, and the techniques were comparable at both high and low
   insect population levels. A significant increase in sample quality, as
   measured by time required for quantification of insects after
   extraction, was found when centrifugal flotation was included in the
   procedure. Time required for individual sample quantification was
   decreased by 30 to 69\% with the use of centrifugal flotation. For
   plants grown in a clay soil, there was no advantage in insect recovery
   efficiency and time required for sample quantification was significantly
   reduced on only one of three sampling dates.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated fecal contamination of Finnish lakes and rivers on the

   thermotolerant coliform bacteria (ThC) and fecal streptococci (FS)
   enumerated in a nationwide monitoring programme during the period
   1962-1984. The number of analyses of TC was 19 672, of ThC 16 456 and of
   FS 96 348. The waters were classified into three groups, influenced
   mainly by municipal wastewaters, industrial wastewaters or diffuse
   loading. Annual median bacterial concentrations were used for presenting
   the trends. All the concentrations decreased until about 1976, except TC
   concentrations in the industrialized and diffuse load areas. Since 1976
   the concentrations decreased more slowly or occasionally even increased,
   especially those of TC. In the whole data the dynamics of bacterial
   loads (CFU s(-1)) were similar to those of annual median bacterial
   concentrations. The most probable explanations for the declining
   bacterial concentrations are increase in the human population served by
   wastewater treatment plants, improved sewage treatment processes,
   decreased wastewater volumes of the forest industry and decrease in the
   number of cattle. The monitoring programme continues.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple use management of aquatic systems frequently involves
   conflicting demands from the various user groups. A 4-year program
   designed to evaluate large-scale artificial fertilization as a potential
   management tool for enhancing the forage and game fish populations of
   Lake Mead, a large Colorado River reservoir, generated considerable
   attention from both on-lake and downstream water users. An extensive
   water-quality monitoring program, undertaken as part of the
   fertilization experiment, demonstrated that the nutrient additions did
   not produce significant negative impacts on Lake Mead water quality from
   either a public health (that is, drinking water) or environmental
   perspective. One set of parameters, for example, hypolimnetic oxygen
   depletion and the relative abundance of blue-green algae, exhibited no
   consistent response to the fertilizer. A second group of parameters did
   respond to fertilizer addition, but changes were both moderate and
   relatively short-term. Examples in this group include chlorophyll,
   threshold odor number, and trihalomethane formation potentials.}},

Abstract = {{Annual and seasonal trends in soluble nitrogen and phosphorus
   concentrations in the River Ythan were examined using routine monitoring
   data collected between 1980 and 1992. NO3-N concentrations increased
   significantly over the 13 year period, with the greatest seasonal
   increase evidence in the spring (P < 0.001). Although this trend
   coincided with changes in cropping practice within the catchment,
   problems associated with assessing trends and causal relationships over
   relatively short time scales have been highlighted. PO4-P concentrations
   were highly variable and showed no significant trend. Output from a
   sewage treatment works at Ellon, serving a population of 8670, resulted
   in an increase in PO4-P concentration to more than double that upstream,
   the impact on NO3-N concentration was negligible. Total mean annual loss
   of NO3-N and PO4-P from the catchment was 1305 tonnes and Is tonnes,
   equivalent to losses of 19 kg N/ha and 0.26 kg P/ha respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration of fluorine in bone ash was measured in tarsometatarsi
   of 30 Canada geese in total. Nine birds originated from Sunndal and 11
   birds from Husnes. These areas, both located in western Norway, are
   exposed to fluoride emissions from aluminium reduction plants. Ten birds
   orginated from Naustdal in western Norway and represented a reference
   population not exposed to any industrial fluoride emissions. The median
   fluorine concentrations were 3374, 1450, and 1334 mg F/kg bone ash in
   birds from Sunndal, Husnes and Naustdal, respectively. The bone fluorine
   concentration in Canada geese from Sunndal was significantly higher than
   in birds from Husnes (P < 0.01) and Naustdal (P = 0.01). Thus, the
   Canada goose population in Sunndal showed evidence of accumulation of
   fluoride due to fluoride emissions from the aluminium smelter, whereas
   birds from Husnes did not seem to be affected by emissions from the
   local aluminium plant. No gross osteofluorotic lesions were demonstrated
   in the birds examined. Due to difficulties with age assessment, varying
   sedentariness and a wide range in background fluorine concentrations,
   the Canada goose is not well suited for use as a bioindicator for
   monitoring fluoride exposure.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess environmentally and occupationally related exposures
   to PAH compounds it is essential to have reference or normal values in
   human body fluids. The establishment of reliable reference intervals is
   an absolute pre-requisite in determining relationships between internal
   PAH exposure in humans and health effects in occupationally exposed
   workers. In this context the estimation of the biological level of PAH
   metabolites in urine from reference populations has become increasingly
   important in the field of environmental and occupational toxicology. The
   present study describes the calculation of tentative reference values
   for urinary l-hydroxypyrene on the basis of two reference populations
   and for urinary alpha-naphthol on the basis of one reference population
   in accordance with IFCC recommendations. The study subjects were 115
   healthy male workers occupationally exposed to PAH at low levels and 121
   reference subjects non-occupationally exposed to PAH. Tentative
   reference values for urinary 1-hydroxypyrene were estimated. In
   addition, 236 healthy male workers were used to estimate tentative
   reference values for urinary alpha-naphthol. The reference populations
   were described by distribution free one-sided tolerance intervals. The
   95\% one-sided tolerance limit calculated for 1-hydroxypyrene in urine
   was 0.053 mu mol/mol creatinine for non-occupationally exposed
   individuals and 0.169 mu mol/mol creatinine for low level PAH exposed
   workers, with the coverage interval (95 +/- 4.5) percent at a
   probability of 0.95. Thus, the probability was 0.975 that the tolerance
   interval included at least 90.5\% of the distribution. In addition, the
   probability was 0.025 that the tolerance interval included > 99.5\% of
   the population. The tolerance interval for alpha-naphthol in urine was
   5.665 mu mol/mol creatinine with the coverage interval (95 +/- 4.5)
   percent at a probability of 0.95.}},

Abstract = {{In 1990 and 1991, populations of the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne
   brassicae, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, were monitored on
   broccoli interplanted with three leguminous cover crops (the living
   mulches) and compared with broccoli without cover crop (clean
   cultivation). The cover crops used were white clover (Trifolium repens
   L.), strawberry clover (Trifolium fragiferum L.) and a mixture of
   birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) and red clover (Trifolium
   praetense L.). Fertilizer was applied as compost or synthetic fertilizer
   crossed with cropping system regime. Brevicoryne brassicae can reach
   pest status in Brassica cropping systems, whereas M. persicae is
   generally innocuous. Both aphids are attacked by the parasitoid
   Diaeretiella rapae. Seasonal aphid abundance, parasitism and population
   growth rates were analyzed.
   No significant effect of fertilizer was found for any of the parameters
   analyzed. The living mulches had lower aphid populations overall,
   although differences with clean cultivation were greatest early in the
   season for M. persicae and diminished over time. No effect of cropping
   system on population growth rate was seen for Brevicoryne brassicae, but
   for M. persicae growth rates were higher in living mulches compared with
   clean cultivation. Parasitism was highest on clean cultivated broccoli
   for both aphid species in 1990 and for M. persicae in 1991, but no
   differences were found for Brevicoryne brassicae in 1991. This suggests
   that differential population growth rates and parasitism seen for M.
   persicae are a result of inhibition of D. rapae in the living mulches.
   Possible reasons for differences in parasitism between the two aphid
   species in living mulches and clean cultivation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Young male baboons typically disperse from their group of birth as they
   near adult size and may continue to migrate between social groups
   throughout their lives. Long-term data on dispersal and residence
   patterns of male baboons in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, were
   available for 110 males in the population, including 43 that were
   monitored during their natal dispersal. These data enabled us to provide
   not only a detailed evaluation of the effects of reproductive
   competition on dispersal but also the first direct estimates of the
   costs of dispersal in male primates and one of the few direct estimates
   of fitness costs associated with breeding in the natal group. Males
   underwent natal dispersal at a median age of 8.5 yr (range, 6.8-13.4 yr)
   and subsequently remained in nonnatal groups for a median tenure of 24
   mo (range, 1-138 mo). Half of the males in the study engaged in moderate
   to extensive reproductive activity before natal dispersal. Reproductive
   costs associated with breeding in the natal group were suggested by the
   high mortality of offspring for whom natal males were their likely
   fathers, even though maternal relatives avoided mating with each other.
   Dispersal involved considerable time spent alone, and therefore the
   costs of dispersal were substantial, because of mortality risks and
   missed reproductive opportunities during dispersal. Female availability
   and male mating success apparently affected both natal and secondary
   dispersal patterns. We present a model of dispersal tendency in order to
   explicate the ways in which differences in population density, predation
   risk, and the distribution of mating opportunities among groups might
   result in complex dispersal patterns that are consistent with both the
   results of the present study and the disparate empirical reports in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Height-growth of individual plants of Chenopodium album in even-aged
   monospecific stands with initial densities of 400, 800, and 3600 plants
   m(-2) was followed from emergence to fruit maturation to elucidate the
   factors responsible for size hierarchy formation. Many individuals
   stopped growing rather abruptly at relatively early stages in the
   vegetative phase and some of them eventually died. The other plants grew
   until fruit maturation and attained large final heights. Depending on
   whether they terminated or continued height-growth during the vegetative
   phase, the plants were called `lower' and `upper' plants.
   The numbers of the `upper' plants per unit area were about 100 plants
   m(-2) irrespective of the initial plant densities, and thus the number
   of `lower' plants increased with the increase in the plant density.
   However, there was an upper limit to the number of the surviving `lower'
   plants (400-700 plants m(-2)). The shapes of the final frequency
   distributions of plant height were largely determined by the ratio of
   the number of `upper' plants to that of surviving `lower' plants, and
   were bimodal for the 400 plants m(-2) plot and L-shaped for the 800 and
   3600 plants m(-2) plots. From these, it is concluded that the
   segregation of the plants into `upper' and `lower' plants is an
   essential factor responsible for the size hierarchy formation. The
   present results also indicate that both bimodal and L-shaped
   distributions can result from one-sided competition for light, depending
   on the initial plant densities.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency distributions of height (H), stem diameter (D) and dry weight
   CN) of Chenopodium album plants in even-aged monocultures at the initial
   plant densities of 400, 800 and 1200 plants m(-2) (400-, 800- and
   1200-plots) were compared. The height distributions at the end of the
   growing season were bimodal for the 400-plot but L-shaped for the 800-
   and 1200-plots. The distributions of diameter and dry weight were
   L-shaped for all the plots. When the size measures were expressed on the
   log scale so as to eliminate effects of the differences in dimension,
   frequency distributions of log W and log H for the 400-plot were
   bimodal. In contrast, the log D distributions were bell-shaped for ah
   the plots.
   To elucidate factors responsible for the differences in frequency
   distributions among log size measures, we examined allometric
   relationships between log size measures. They were all non-linear mainly
   because the allometric relationships were markedly different between the
   plants forming the upper-most leaf layer ('upper' plants) and the
   suppressed plants ('lower' plants). A striking feature was that the
   heights of the `upper' plants were almost uniform in spite of their
   varied diameters. Continuous monitoring of growth of the individual
   plants in the stand revealed that the height of the `upper' plants
   became uniform just after the canopy closure, at about 30 d after
   emergence, and that uniform growth in height of these plants continued
   for about 70 d until the end of the growing season. On the other hand,
   growth of the suppressed `lower' plants terminated at various stages
   before flowering. The `height convergence' of the `upper' plants was
   thus identified as a key factor for the segregation of the plants into
   the two groups of distinctly different allometries.
   Since the segregation of the plants into `upper' and `lower' plants was
   reflected in their dry weights, frequency distributions of log W were
   similar to those of log H. The bell-shaped distributions of log D were
   attributed to the overlapping of the diameters of slender `upper' plants
   with those of larger `lower' plants. Significance of `height
   convergence' is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of exposure to metals under and laboratory conditions were
   investigated in the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The
   examined biological responses included the concentrations of heavy
   metals, the level of glutathione, and the activity of several enzymes
   selected among glutathione-dependent oxidoreductases and hydrolases:
   glutathione reductase, EC1.6.4.2; glyoxalase I, EC4.4.1.5; glyoxalase
   II, EC3.1.2.6; glutathione S-transferases, EC2.5.1.18; Se-dependent,
   EC1.11.1.9 and Se-independent, EC2.5.1.18 glutathione peroxidases;
   catalase, EC1.11.1.6; superoxide dismutase, EC1.15.1.1; alkaline
   phosphatase, EC3.1.3.1; cholinesterase, EC3.1.1.8; arylesterases,
   EC3.1.1.2. The analyses were carried out on digestive gland and gills of
   mussels from two populations, respectively from a polluted and a clean
   site. The same parameters were measured in control mussels transplanted
   to the polluted environment, and in molluscs exposed to copper under
   laboratory conditions. The comparison between different field and
   laboratory exposures was expected to give useful indications for a
   proper use of biochemical responses as biomarkers in monitoring trace
   metal pollution. Compared to control mussels, the polluted ones (native,
   transplanted and copper-exposed) showed significantly lower levels of
   glutathione and higher activities of the glyoxalases (which detoxify
   reactive alpha-ketoaldehydes formed in cellular oxidative processes). On
   the other hand, native mussels from both the polluted and control
   populations exhibited similar enzymatic activities of glutathione
   reductase, glutathione peroxidases, catalase, superoxide dismutase and
   alkaline phosphatase, whereas, in both transplanted and copper-exposed
   mussels, these enzymes showed significant variations. This finding could
   suggest the occurrence of some adaptation or compensatory mechanism in
   chronically polluted organisms. No clear results were obtained with
   glutathione S-transferases, whereas arylesterases and cholinesterases
   appeared not to be affected by metal pollution. From the results, three
   different kind of biological responses were identified and the
   implications for ecotoxicological studies discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored numbers of Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) in
   Washington from fall 1980 through spring 1992 at Willapa Bay, and from
   fall 1986 through spring 1993 in the Dungeness area. We estimated brant
   use by converting the counts into use days. Coincidentally we also
   monitored variations in the extent of eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds by
   remote sensing techniques. At Willapa, brant use was positively
   correlated with the total extent of eelgrass beds and negatively
   correlated with the extent of oyster beds that were located within
   eelgrass beds, and where eelgrass had been removed by mechanical means.
   A 52\% decline in brant use was associated with a 22\% decline in
   eelgrass. At Dungeness there was a significant negative trend in
   spring-staging brant use. Overall a 63\% decline in brant use coincided
   with a 31\% decline in eelgrass. The Dungeness eelgrass beds may have
   declined because of natural factors. In both areas, brant use during the
   spring-staging period was more related to eelgrass extent than brant use
   during the winter months. These results suggest that Black Brant use in
   coastal Washington is limited by eelgrass availability. Immatures
   averaged 10.4\% of the population at Willapa and 9.9\% at Dungeness and
   are amongst the lowest reported. A shortage of eelgrass during the
   critical spring-staging period may have led to reduced endogenous
   reserves and associated low reproductive success of Black Brant that
   staged in coastal Washington, The shortage of eelgrass may have
   contributed to the observed southward shift to Mexico by wintering
   brant.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most difficult tasks in conservation biology is identifying
   populations subject to stress before such stress has a detrimental
   impact on the population, thus allowing conservation and remedial action
   to be undertaken. Measuring fitness (fecundity, survival etc.) changes
   directly is often difficult, expensive or impractical The ability of an
   organism to buffer its development against disturbances (developmental
   stability) is often considered an integral component of an indiviaual's
   fitness. Data are presented from a number of studies that establish a
   clear relationship between developmental stability and fitness in
   response to both genetic and environmental stress. Consequently, I
   suggest that developmental stability may be used as a surrogate for more
   direct fitness estimation for use in conservation biology and
   biomonitoring programs and that is has widespread application as an
   early warning system for monitoring the effect of genetic and
   environmental stresses on natural populations.}},

   FOR THE DRY SEASON}},

Abstract = {{1. In tropical savanna environments rainfall is often very seasonal, so
   that much of the year is characterized by a long and unpredictable dry
   season. Because the timing and availability of rain exerts a major
   influence on plant growth and production, many species during the dry
   period exhibit dramatic reduction in leaf quality. Accordingly, and kind
   of behaviour shown by phytophagous insects that synchronizes larval
   feeding with food availability will be adaptive.
   2. The reproductive status of three Mycalesis butterflies was monitored
   over a 2-year period (1989-90) in north-eastern Queensland, Australia,
   at a lowland site (Cardwell, 18 degrees 16'S, 146 degrees 02'E) which
   experiences a pronounced dry season. Females of these species and of
   five other satyrines (Ypthima, Hypocysta spp.) were also examined less
   intensively during the dry season in areas throughout northern and
   central Queensland, north of the tropic of Capricorn.
   3. These relatively sedentary butterflies exhibit three different
   strategies for dealing with the unpredictable dry period and associated
   deterioration of larval food plants (grass). First, five species appear
   to breed continuously, though for most reproductive activity (mature egg
   number) declines markedly in the late dry season. Two of these
   (Hypocysta irius, H.metirius) are restricted to less seasonal and more
   favourable (wetter) areas but the three others (Ypthima arctous,
   H.adiante, H. pseudirius) occur widely in the relatively dry savanna,
   where they may specialize on grass in moister microenvironments. Second,
   two species (M.terminus, M.sirius) live in predictably moist habitats
   which are buffered from climatic extremes; they breed for much of the
   season but reproductive activity declines as the dry season progresses
   and may cease late in the season. Third, one species (M.perseus) is more
   opportunistic, breeding for only a limited interval during the
   favourable (wet) periods; during the long dry season adults contract to
   moist refugia and remain in reproductive diapause.
   4. Spending the late dry season as an adult, either in diapause or with
   mature eggs, may improve the capacity to utilize new growth of grasses
   at the start of the favourable season, thereby enhancing population
   growth during good times. It may also provide additional flexibility to
   counter the temporal uncertainty of the dry season.
   5. The strategy of residing in more equitable habitats or specializing
   on predictable foods may be the most restrictive in terms of
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{1. The larvae of the multivoltine imported willow leaf beetle,
   Plagiodera versicolora (Laicharting), are found in larval aggregations
   during the first half of the larval stage. An experimental study was
   conducted to test for seasonal (brood) and group size effects on larval
   fitness. For each of the three broods, egg group sizes of 1, 4, 8, 16,
   24 and 32 were established in the field and monitored for the first 6
   days post-hatching.
   2. There was no effect of group size on larval weight, but there was a
   significant effect of group size on survival. Individuals from group
   size 16 had the highest survival, which coincides with the mean natural
   cluster size of 15.3 eggs.
   3. There were no significant interactions between brood and group size.
   4. The effect of larval weight on adult fitness was determined in the
   laboratory and the field. Larval weight was correlated with egg
   production in the laboratory but not in the field.}},

Abstract = {{We used flow cytometry (FCM) to conduct a multiple-tissue assay on
   slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) inhabiting radioactive seepage
   basins. Duplicate samples of blood, heart, spleen and kidney were
   analysed on two different cytometers (Leitz MPV and Coulter Profile II),
   each employing distinct staining protocols (DAPI and PI, respectively).
   Both DAPI and PI assays of spleen cells demonstrated significantly
   greater variation in DNA content for the basin turtles than for
   `control' animals from nearby, uncontaminated sites. Basin turtles also
   exhibited significant cell-cycle effects for blood and spleen, again
   revealed by both assays. These corroborative findings demonstrate the
   consistency and repeatability of FCM assays in environmental monitoring
   and identify the particularly sensitive nature of turtle blood and
   spleen to mutagenic agents. Our survey complements previous FCM studies
   on sliders from contaminated sites and thereby underscores the species'
   potential as a sentinel for biomarker assays.}},

Abstract = {{Biological monitoring programs to assess contaminant-induced impacts in
   aquatic systems are being developed and implemented by several federal
   agencies and many states. Genetic diversity and allozyme frequency may
   be valuable indicators of such impact because they are both sensitive to
   exposure and ecologically relevant in populations. The purpose of this
   study was to examine whether genetic diversity and structure of
   Campostoma anomalum populations could serve as effective biomarkers of
   exposure to anthropogenic stress by comparing genetic measures with
   other biological indicators of water quality. Fish were collected from
   14 sites on seven streams by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency as
   part of their stream water quality evaluation program. Values for the
   Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) and the Invertebrate Community Index
   (ICI) were determined for these 14 sites. Starch gel electrophoresis was
   used to collect genetic data for eight variable enzyme loci. Genetic
   diversity measures were not associated with site IBI or ICI values.
   However, the range of site IBI and ICI values was limited. Allele and
   genotype frequencies were significantly different at the point source
   compared to sites upstream and downstream indicating that genetic
   structure may be an indicator of water quality that is sensitive enough
   to detect change prior to species loss. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Latitudinal trends in reproductive characteristics are evident for some
   species of Clupeidae. However, selection for life history styles may
   operate at the population level. The reproductive cycles of alewife
   Alosa pseudaharengus and threadfin shad Dorosoma petenense in Dale
   Hollow Reservoir, Tennessee, were monitored over two spawning seasons on
   the basis of a gonadosomatic index (GSI). Inshore movements normally
   associated with spawning migrations were monitored using gill nets in
   spring 1989. GSI values peaked for both species at least one month
   earlier in 1989 than in 1988 due to warmer water temperatures earlier in
   the year. Highest GSI values for female alewife occurred each year when
   surface water temperatures were about 20 degrees C; threadfin shad GSI
   values peaked at temperatures of 22 degrees-26 degrees C. Trends in male
   GSI values in both species were similar to those in females. Alewives
   were not abundant in warm (> 22 degrees C), shallow water after I May
   1989, but alewife GSI values remained high after this date, suggesting
   that elevated inshore temperatures limited alewife reproduction. All
   aspects of alewife reproduction were comparable to other populations of
   alewife but did not follow latitudinal trends. Threadfin shad
   reproductive characteristics were similar to other published accounts.
   We suggest that thermal regimes and reservoir trophic status are
   important factors for clupeid reproduction and population-level analysis
   is suggested when considering reproductive styles. Further, our ability
   to predict the ecology of introduced species in freshwater systems is
   impaired when species considered have not coevolved or evolved in marine
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of consuming low doses of E-64, a cysteine protease
   inhibitor, on life history parameters of Epilachna varivestis Mulsant,
   the Mexican bean beetle, was evaluated in bioassays in which E-64 was
   applied to lima bean leaves.  Mortality, larval growth rates, and adult
   reproductive patterns were monitored and used to estimate life history
   parameters.  Ingestion of this low dosage of E-64 increased the time to
   first oviposition, inter-egg mass interval, and number of days to
   complete larval development.  E-64-fed females mated to E-64-fed males
   produced fewer eggs.  There was no statistically significant difference
   between E-64-fed and control insects for either adult mortality, larval
   mortality, pupal weight or egg hatch (from E-64-fed females).  On a
   per-day basis, insects fed E-64-treated leaves consumed similar amounts
   of leaf tissue to the control insects but, because of their longer
   larval development time, they required more leaf tissue to complete
   their larval development.  The observed differences in life history
   parameters would potentially translate into large differences in
   population growth.  The value of protease inhibitors for resistance
   against multivoltine specialist insects is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{For 3 yr (1989-1991) we examined effects of different integrated pest
   management (IPM) programs on populations of mites in an apple orchard in
   Nova Scotia, Canada.  The stage 1 IPM program involved pest monitoring
   and application of insecticides (phosmet, pirimicarb, Bacillus
   thuringiensis var. kurstaki Berliner + one-tenth the recommended rate of
   cypermethrin) known to be harmless or slightly harmful to the phytoseiid
   predator Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten.  With the stage 2 program, most
   insecticide applications were replaced by alternatives such as
   insecticidal soap, insect pathogens, and insect growth regulators.  In
   stage 1 and stage 2 plots, apple scab, Venturia inaequalis (Cke.) Wint.,
   was controlled either with captan, a fungicide that is harmless to
   phytophagous mites and T. pyri, or with metiram, a fungicide that is
   slightly harmful to phytophagous mites and moderately harmful to T.
   pyri.  In June and July 1989, densities of European red mite, Panonychus
   ulmi (Koch), and apple rust mite, Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa), were
   too high (maximum 7.6 to >100 per leaf) to be controlled by the low
   numbers of T. pyri (<0.1 per leaf) present in the orchard.  An early
   August application of the miticide propargite in stage 1 plots or
   hexythiazox in stage 2 plots caused populations of P. ulmi and A.
   schlechtendali to decline to 0 per leaf without reducing T. pyri
   populations.  In 1990 and 1991, mite counts in stage 2 plots did not
   differ with fungicide regime.  In stage 1 plots, however, counts of P.
   ulmi and A. schlechtendali were higher and counts of T. pyri, but not
   the stigmaeid predator Zetzellia mali (Ewing), were lower with metiram
   than with captan.  Biological control was effective in stage 2 plots and
   all captan plots:  maximum counts of P. ulmi and A. schlechtendali were
   <1.5 per leaf and 6 per leaf, respectively.  Maxima were higher, but
   still subeconomic, in the stage 1 metiram plots:  5 per leaf for P. ulmi
   and 9 per leaf for A. schlechtendali.  Additive toxic effects of
   insecticides and fungicides on T. pyri, the possible contribution of Z.
   mali to biological control despite competition with T. pyri, and
   recommendations for integrated mite control are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Current environmental policy tends to evaluate potential, theoretical
   exposure to health risks by evaluating one chemical or hazard al a time.
   Risk assessment techniques used by the U. S. Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) and other government agencies do not evaluate the
   cumulative impact of exposure to environmental contaminants. This
   problem is of particular significance to low-income and minority
   populations who lend to live in neighborhoods and work in locations that
   involve exposure to pollutants in air, water, and workplace activity.
   Certain areas within the border typify this lifestyle. The problem is
   further complicated by the fact that EPA operates separate programs for
   different `'media.'' Exposure patterns in the border suggest the need
   for a cross-media pollution prevention approach. Minority recruitment
   into health research, a coordination of research approaches and dollars,
   and new resources for effective monitoring of minority communities could
   provide a basic assessment of the risks and their sources. Further
   research into the cumulative impacts of prevalent subsets of chemicals
   is also needed. Recent efforts in the Great Lakes may provide a model
   for this type of regional, cross-border effort.}},

Abstract = {{Recent mass mortalities among several marine mammal populations have led
   to speculations about increased susceptibility to viral infections as a
   result of contaminant-induced immunosuppression. In a 2.5-year study, we
   fed herring from either the relatively uncontaminated Atlantic Ocean or
   the contaminated Baltic Sea to two groups of captive harbor seals and
   monitored immune function in the seals. Seals fed the contaminated fish
   were less able to mount a specific immunological response to ovalbumin,
   as measured by in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions and
   antibody responses. The skin reaction to this protein antigen was
   characterized by the appearance of mononuclear cells which peaked at 24
   hr after intradermal administration, characteristic of DTH reactions in
   other animals studied. These DTH responses correlated well with in vitro
   tests of T-lymphocyte function, implicating this cell type in the
   reaction. Aryl-hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor-dependent toxic equivalent
   (TEQ) profiles in blubber biopsies taken from the seals implicated
   polychlorinated biphenyls rather than dioxins or furans in the observed
   immunosuppression. Marine mammal populations currently inhabiting
   polluted coastal environments in Europe and North America may therefore
   have an increased susceptibility to infections, and pollution may have
   played a role in recent virus-induced mass mortalities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares experimental growth and yield study plots with
   sample plots from forest inventories.  The difference in research
   objectives leads to a situation where sample plots are available that
   are representative of the total population, but give only limited
   information on site conditions and management history.  However,
   detailed information on site condition and management history is
   available for growth and yield plots, but does not represent the total
   population.  As an example, Swiss growth and yield plots are compared
   with survey plots in terms of species distribution, stem form, slope
   class and elevation.
   A critical review is given of the two most common samping designs for
   regional forest surveys.  Continuous forest inventory is recommended
   over the more efficient but more complex sampling with partial
   replacement design for use in conjunction with growth and yield studies.
   The limitations of both growth and yield plots and sample plots are
   discussed.  Recommendations for linking both types of plots to close
   information gaps are given to improve both forest surveys and growth and
   yield studies.}},

Abstract = {{1. In recent decades, many of the common and widespread butterflies in
   Britain which do not already occupy the whole of the country have
   expanded in range.
   2. Populations of the species which have expanded in range, monitored
   for varying periods during 1974-92 have, overall, shown significantly
   more increases than declines in abundance, as have the species with
   ranges which already occupy most of Britain.
   3. Nearly all of the common species have increased in abundance more in
   the east of Britain than in the west.
   4. Although the reasons for recent range expansions and increases in
   abundance of common butterflies are not known, it seems likely that
   changes in weather have played a role.
   5. It is argued that the geographical differences in population trends
   suggest that a factor (or factors) with a similar eastern bias is also
   implicated in the changes in abundance and perhaps of range. Some
   possible factors are discussed briefly.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted in Niger to compare pheromone-baited trapping
   systems for monitoring adults of the millet stem borer, Coniesta
   ignefusalis (Hampson), a pest of pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum (L.)
   R. Brown. A water-oil trap was effective after optimization of various
   trap parameters. A trap tray of 32-cm diameter was more effective and
   easier to handle than other sizes tested. Optimum trap shade size was
   8-21 cm, positioned 25 cm above the tray. Motor oil, soap, or liquid
   detergent were more effective than vegetable oil as surfactants. The
   experimental trap caught significantly more male moths than four
   commercial traps. More moths were caught with large, thick polythene
   vial pheromone dispensers than small, thin vials, but the attractiveness
   of both declined significantly within 14 d. Trap catches were not
   greatly affected by the height of the crop or by the height of the trap
   above ground level when the traps were placed individually at different
   sites. However, when traps were stacked at different heights at one
   site, more moths were caught in traps at heights of 0.10-0.50 m than at
   1.30 and 2.0 m above ground level, regardless of crop height. This
   system is appropriate for monitoring of pest populations by subsistence
   farmers and national and international agricultural research stations in
   the Sahelian region of Africa.}},

Abstract = {{1. Extensive changes in marine communities in southwest Britain and the
   western English Channel have been recorded during the past 70 years.
   2. Over the same period there was a climatic warming from the early
   1920s, then a cooling to the early 1980s, with recent resumption of
   warming; the change in annual mean temperature was approximately +/-0.5
   degrees C.
   3. Marked changes occurred in plankton community structure; the
   distribution of both plankton and intertidal organisms was affected,
   with latitudinal shifts of up to 120 miles; there were increases or
   decreases of 2-3 orders of magnitude in abundance.
   4. Warm water species increased in abundance and extended their range
   during periods of warming, while cold-water species declined or
   retreated; the reverse occurred during the period of cooling.
   5. Climate change can influence marine communities by a combination of:
   direct effect on the organisms; effects mediated by biotic interactions;
   and indirectly through ocean currents.
   6. From climate models that indicate rises of mean temperature of 2
   degrees C in the next 50 years, and from the observed changes, we can
   expect future latitudinal shifts of 200-400 miles in distribution of
   plankton, fish and benthos, with extensive restructuring of planktonic,
   pelagic and benthic communities.
   7. Species common now in the Bay of Biscay will become common in the
   English Channel; those presently restricted to the western English
   Channel could colonise the central Irish Sea; changes in community
   structure could lead to lower abundances of infaunal benthos and fish.
   8. To fully prove the effects of global warming, future changes in the
   marine biota must exceed those recorded in the 1950s and 1960s.}},

Abstract = {{In a garden experiment we monitored tillering and flowering for target
   plants of two grass species, surrounded by one to five neighbours and
   compared them with control plants growing alone. We analysed the results
   using a non-linear regression. The species differed markedly in their
   seasonal patterns of growth but these differences faded when growing
   with two or more neighbours. The presence of neighbours had a
   significant depressing effect on both tillering and flowering in both
   species. Effects and responses were strongly asymmetrical concerning
   species and mode of growth. Andropogon semiberbis is in disadvantage
   against Trachypogon Plumosus concerning vegetative growth. However, T.
   plumosus is strongly affected in its reproductive growth by competition
   not only from A. semiberbis but also from conspecific neighbours. We
   conclude that the complexity of interactions between effects and
   responses as well as vegetative and reproductive growth could have a net
   result of competitive equivalence or compensating competitive abilities
   of these two species.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the
   associated random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique to
   study variation in samples of the sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, before
   and after acclimation to freshwater. Acclimation trials were repeated
   twice, in 1989 and 1990, for two samples originating from the same
   broodstock (individuals from different localities along the Italian
   coasts), with overall mortality rates averaging 94 and 75\% in the 2 yr,
   respectively. Analyses are based on 126 polymorphic RAPD markers, scored
   in at least 39 individuals for each of the starting and acclimated
   samples in both years. Analysis of RAPD patterns revealed high levels of
   DNA polymorphism in both 1989 and 1990 starting samples. The acclimated
   samples maintained similar polymorphism levels. Shifts in marker
   frequencies between starting and acclimated samples occurred in both
   years. A correspondence analysis carried out on multimarker individual
   profiles suggests that the two starting samples resulted from uneven
   sampling of the same heterogenous broodstock. This analysis clearly
   separates RAPD phenotypes from starting and acclimated samples in both
   years and identifies the RAPD markers responsible for such displacement.
   Patterns of RAPD varia tion are compared with previous allozymic studies
   carried out on the same samples. A major difference between the two
   studies was the number of markers available. Fewer allozyme loci were
   studied than were RAPD markers. The cause of repeated shifts for
   allozyme alleles in replicate experiments were almost certainly due to
   selection, while statistical chance could explain the repeated shift of
   only one out of more than 100 RAPD markers. We have shown that RAPD
   analysis, if carried out carefully, is quite reproducible and sensitive
   enough to reveal high levels of variation among individuals from the
   same broodstock. A major drawback of this approach is the still unclear
   inheritance patterns of RAPD polymorphisms. The use of multivariate
   analyses is suggested as a possible alternative to traditional
   population genetics techniques to analyze patterns of variation in the
   absence of a precise genetic interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{In March 1989, The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative
   Services (HRS) issued a Health Advisory recommending the limited
   consumption of several fish species caught from the Everglades region of
   South Florida due to elevated methylmercury (MeHg) levels (average 2-3
   ppm in fish meat). There were no reports of clinical MeHg poisoning in
   humans in Florida, although deaths of Florida panthers were attributed
   to mercury (Hg), poisoning. This study evaluated the extent of MeHg
   exposure in persons eating contaminated fish in the Everglades region.
   Populations at risk were identified including sport fishermen,
   Everglades Residents and subsistence fishermen. Over 1700 individuals
   were approached; those who had eaten fish or wildlife from the
   contaminated areas at least once/month for the prior three months were
   asked to participate. Three hundred and fifty (350) participants
   completed a brief questionnaire and provided a hair sample for Hg
   analysis. In 119 (36\%) of individuals with levels above the limits of
   detection, the mean total Hg in hair was 3.62 +/- 3.0 mu g/g {[}+
   standard deviation] with a range of 1.28 - 15.57. The most at risk
   populations identified with respect to Hg levels were Blacks and men.
   Although the majority of the participants had fished in the Everglades
   for many years (> 15 years), they reported relatively low intake of fish
   and had low hair Hg levels compared with similar populations in prior
   studies of other populations at risk. Although 71\% of participants knew
   of the State Health Advisories concerning ingestion of Hg contaminated
   fish from the Everglades, this did not change their consumption habits.
   In addition, Blacks, individuals of lower income and of lower education
   levels were less likely to know about the Health Advisories. Given
   recent studies of neurologic effects from relatively low in utero MeHg
   exposure, the continuation of the Mercury Health Advisories and wildlife
   monitoring in the Everglades are warranted, especially for women of
   childbearing age and children. However, public education must be
   targeted for the populations at risk identified in this study in order
   to reach these populations more effectively.}},

Abstract = {{The release of mercury (Hg) from dental amalgam fillings has been
   verified by several authors. In this study, the emission rate of
   Hg-o-vapor from the oral cavity (O-Hg) and the urinary Hg-excretion rate
   (U-Hg) have been studied with 34 healthy individuals. In ten cases, the
   urinary excretions of silver (U-Ag) and the fecal excretions of Hg and
   Ag (F-Hg, F-Ag) were also monitored. All variables, except U-Ag, were
   significantly related to the load of amalgam. According to this study,
   an individual with a moderate load of amalgam, i.e. 30 restored
   surfaces, is predicted to exhibit the following emission rates: O-Hg=22,
   U-Hg=3, F-Hg=60 and F-Ag=27 mu g/d (d=24 hours), consistent with a gross
   mass balance for Hg of approximately 60 mu g/d. The corresponding
   systemic uptake of Hg was estimated to 12 mu g/d based on external data
   relating air Hg-o-exposures to urinary Hg-excretions. The worst case
   individual showed a gross mass balance of 200 mu g Hg/d connected to a
   systemic uptake of 70 mu g Hg/d. These values were compared to the
   average intake of total-Hg by a Swedish diet (2 mu g/d) and to the WHO's
   tolerable value for intake of total-Hg by food (45 mu g/d). Upscaled to
   the entire Swedish population (8 mill.), the data suggests a
   fecal/urinary emission to the environment of 100 kg Hg yearly
   originating from a population load of amalgam fillings containing 90,000
   kg of Hg.}},

Abstract = {{The moss monitoring technique (Hylocomium splendens) for tracking
   environmental concentrations of atmospheric contaminants is applied to
   arctic Alaska, Median 1990-1992 concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cu, V, and Zn
   are less than or equal to median 1990 concentrations in northernmost
   parts of the Nordic/European monitoring network. Extremely low Pb
   concentrations (median, 0.6 mu g/g) indicate that long-range atmospheric
   transport (LRTAP) of Pb to arctic Alaskan ecosystems is neglible.
   However, samples taken adjacent to a local source point (the Dalton
   Highway) have elevated Pb, V, and Cu. Site-specific watershed studies
   indicate that natural within- and between-site variability does not
   affect the interpretation of our Alaskan data relative to the
   Nordic/European network for Pb, V and Cu. Variability is greater
   relative to regional data for Cd and Zn, but neither LRTAP nor the
   Dalton Highway appear to be significant contributors to local
   concentrations of Cd and Zn. Pilot studies of blueberries and other
   selected wildlife forage foods indicate that concentrations in H.
   splendens are generally comparable to those in a common caribou forage
   lichen, but that H. splendens may underestimate Cu and overestimate Pb,
   Hg, and in some cases Cd, relative to selected forage fruits. More
   studies of contaminants in arctic Alaskan forage foods are needed to
   characterize potential exposure of human and wildlife populations to
   airborne contaminants in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Before World War II, the mortality pattern in the Arctic was
   characterized by very high mortality due to infectious diseases, in
   particular tuberculosis, and to injuries. Life expectancy was low and
   chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease were rare. Improved
   living conditions and health services have drastically altered health
   conditions since then. The circumpolar population groups are small and
   scattered, and the burden of pathogenic factors is high. The impact of
   environmental contaminants is therefore difficult to study
   epidemiologically. In the absence of local industrial sources of
   pollution, mercury and organochlorines in the traditional diet are
   presently the most serious environmental threats to human health in
   Greenland. Although we observe no effects on human health at present,
   the situation is potentially serious and should be closely monitored.}},

   populations, carried out for two years (1992-1993) in the Sverdlovsk
   region near Kamensk-Ural'ski, revealed an increase of morphological
   diversity in terms of non-metric skull traits along the axis of the
   East-Ural Radioactive Track (EURT). In the population affected by
   radioactive contamination, frequencies of non-metric skull traits
   deviated significantly from those in two control populations located
   beyond the EURT boundaries. The deviations were not related to
   particular environmental factors varying among the years of our study,
   which implied a genetic basis of non-metric differentiation. We suggest
   that the observed increase of phenotypic malformations within the EURT
   zone has been caused by the permanent impact of low doses of radioactive
   contamination, leading to an accumulation of minor mutations and to
   disturbances in regular ontogenetic development of the red vole.}},

   seaspawning and anadromous stocks. To better manage this fishery, a
   research programme was initiated so that monitoring and prediction
   programmes could be initiated for both stock types of whitefish. The
   recruitment success of sea-spawning whitefish year classes was
   established at an early age, and a monitoring and prediction programme
   for these stocks was established using four selected coastal areas. It
   included larval seine-nettings in spring and test-fishings in autumn.
   Insufficient biological knowledge was available to establish a parallel

Abstract = {{The density of a fluctuating adult (other than young-of-the-year)
   vendace population of Lake Puulavesi was monitored using echo-sounding,
   catch per unit effort (CPUE) of autumn seine fishing and virtual
   population. The echo-sounding estimate of density was also compared with
   catch of trawl per swept area (CSA). All the estimates were highly
   correlated. Echo-sounding appeared to overestimate the adult vendace
   population in years of high young-of-the-year vendace abundance and in
   years of low adult vendace abundance. Echo-sounding was not sufficient
   to closely monitor the fluctuations of adult vendace density, but when
   combined with independent indices of population density it could be
   successfully used in stock density estimation. The relative density
   index from CPUE was calibrated with the echo-sounding estimates
   considered least biased. The estimated vendace density varied from 1006
   ind./ha in 1984 to 21 ind./ha in 1991. The relative density indices from
   CPUE and CSA were considered suitable indices for long-term routine
   monitoring of vendace stocks in a lake.}},

Abstract = {{Two unexploited lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) populations were
   intensively fished and then monitored for at least four years after
   exploitation to determine growth and recruitment responses to
   exploitation, and the duration of these responses. Lake whitefish growth
   increased for two years in the population where 26\% of the adults were
   removed and it increased far three years in the population where 40\% of
   the adults were removed Recruitment increased in each exploited
   population. Exploiting lake whitefish populations in smaller lakes at
   regular intervals is a viable method of commercially utilizing these
   smaller stocks without causing the stocks to collapse.}},

Abstract = {{The four vendace fisheries in Lake Puulavesi are commercial trawling,
   semi-commercial seining, domestic gill netting and commercial gill
   netting. Fishing efforts of these fisheries were monitored as the yield
   per unit effort (YPUE) of vendace declined. The seine and domestic gill
   net fishing effort declined along with the decline in YPUE, which had a
   compensatory effect upon change in stock. One commercial trawling unit
   and gill net fisherman first increased their fishing effort as YPUE
   declined, which introduced a depensatory effect upon stock change. Later
   they reduced their effort as YPUE declined to an unprofitable level,
   which had a compensatory effect. All the fisheries seem to match with
   type III functional response. The increase in effort during the stock
   decline may broaden the range of stock fluctuation and increase
   variability of the stock if recruitment is generally independent of the
   spawning population size. Means for controlling access to the commercial
   fishery are considered necessary in order to 1) prevent
   over-exploitation when the stock declines, and 2) preserve the
   possibility for commercial fishermen to increase effort and thereby
   financially survive the periods of low stocks.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental gill net catches at various sites in lentic and lotic
   ecosystems affected by the construction of the hydroelectric complex and
   in adjacent natural lakes were used to monitor changes in the whitefish
   populations following impoundment and river diversion (1977-1992). In La
   Grande 2 and Opinaca reservoirs and in the Boyd-Skami diversion, catch
   per unit of effort (CPUE) practically tripled during the first years
   after impoundment, to gradually decrease at levels slightly higher than
   those observed during pre-impoundment. In Caniapiscau reservoir, CPUE
   decreased during the first years following impoundment, but reached a
   maximum nine years later (1991). Year class strength suggests that
   reproductive success was maximal during the creation of La Grande 2 and
   Opinaca reservoirs, thus contributing to the subsequent increase in
   CPUE. Local changes in abiotic and biotic conditions at some of the
   sites sampled probably caused movements of fish, thus contributing to
   the observed increase in CPUE. Lake whitefish CPUE (La Grande 2 and
   Opinaca reservoirs) and year class strength (Opinaca only) correlated
   positively with zoo-plankton biomass; however, no correlation was found
   with winter water levels. Lake whitefish growth rates and condition
   increased after impoundment, to return to nearly initial values during
   later years; rates of change of these parameters varied in the three
   reservoirs.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{This study examined sexual and other social behavior in relation to
   menstrual cycle phase in four mixed-sex social groups of Cebus apella.
   Groups consisted of two adult males and either six or nine adult
   females. Menstrual cycles of high (rank 1-2),and low (rank 3-7)
   dominance-rank females from each group were monitored via vaginal swabs,
   and correlated with data collected from ongoing behavioral observations.
   Only cycles bounded by positive detection of menstrual blood were
   included in this analysis (n = 15 females, 182 cycles; mean +/- s.d.,
   cycle length = 20.8 +/- 1.2 days). Rates of copulation and female
   solicitation of males varied significantly with cycle phase, with
   highest rates at midcycle. While total rates of solicitation and
   copulation did not vary with female dominance rank, copulation rates
   with the dominant male were significantly greater for high ranking
   females than for low ranking ones. Variance observed in affiliative and
   agonistic behaviors, including those with males, was attributable to
   female rank rather than cycle phase. Females and males were also
   observed attempting to interfere with copulations of lower ranking
   same-sex individuals. Although further study, particularly of wild
   populations, is needed, these results indicate that female-female
   reproductive competition should be included as a component of the
   capuchin breeding system. As in other primate species, both social and
   hormone-related factors influence the sexual behavior of Cebus apella.

Abstract = {{We have monitored the number of arctic foxes and microtine rodents in
   northern Finland for 30 years. Arctic fox densities were estimated by
   inventories at den sites, and microtine abundance by snap trapping. Time
   series analyses showed that the arctic fox population fluctuated widely
   but always close together with the microtines in a five year cycle.
   However, there was no time lag in the numerical response of foxes on
   microtines. The strong dependence on microtines was confirmed by
   analyses of faecal droppings and food remains at dens. In summer time
   microtines consisted in average of 45\% of the diet and reindeer 30\%,
   but during winters reindeer was the most important food source with 45\%
   compared to 15\% for microtines. There was a surprising positive
   correlation between number of voles and reindeer carcasses, suggesting
   competition or alternatively an external correlation from e.g. weather.
   Mean litter size of the arctic fox was also highly dependent on
   microtine abundance but decreased during the study period despite that
   food resources had not changed. Further, when microtines had high
   densities during two consecutive years, arctic foxes only responded to
   the first year. A feeding experiment resulted in an increase in number
   of red foxes but had no or little effect on arctic foxes. So, it is
   difficult to single out one explanation to the decline and second year
   effect. Food was probably not involved and we do not know if diseases
   and parasites have been involved. However, both competition and
   predation, primarily from the red fox, may be responsible together with
   climatic or weather changes.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological deformities in chironomid larvae represent sublethal
   effects of exposure to heavy metals, organochloropesticides and other
   organic xenobiotics. Because chironomid larvae live in close contact
   with sediment and often feed on organic detritus and algae associated
   with it, morphological deformities exhibit a substantial potential as
   monitoring tool for assessing sediment toxicity. Pollutants rarely occur
   singly and in most contaminated ecosystems biota are exposed to complex
   chemical mixtures. Chironomid deformities occurring in field populations
   may therefore be considered as responses to the concurrent action of
   different toxicants. The main objective of this review paper is to offer
   a conceptual framework on mixture toxicity conducive to further
   elaboration of chironomid deformities as a monitoring tool for
   contaminated sediments. Current knowledge of chironomid deformity
   induction is compiled and joint toxicity concepts and mixture models
   reviewed. A selection is presented of studies dealing with joint effects
   of heavy metals and pesticides, two classes of deformity-inducing
   compounds, and factors determining their joint toxicity are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We studied experimentally male distribution in relation to key
   resources, food and females, during winter and at the onset of breeding
   in eight enclosure populations of the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus.
   In the experiment we manipulated the social environment of individuals
   under thick snow cover. After we had determined the male movements in a
   mixed population of both sexes all females of each enclosure were
   captured and kept in a cage at one end of the enclosure while food was
   offered in the opposite end. Male movements between these two patches
   were monitored by life-trapping under the snow. We found a seasonal
   pattern in the distribution of males in relation to key resources. 1)
   During the non-breeding season the manipulation of female and food
   distribution did not affect the male movements significantly, but 2) as
   expected, at the onset of breeding females were the preferred resource
   for the males. The results are discussed in the light of survival and
   mating strategies of males.}},

Abstract = {{Two populations of Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, from metal-contaminated
   and uncontaminated habitats, differed in their intra- and extracellular
   Cd contents but had similar cellular levels of Cu. Moss shoots were
   supplied with a pulse of toxic metal by incubating in Cu or Cd nitrate
   solutions and effects on respiration, photosynthesis and intracellular K
   loss were monitored with time after initial exposure. Increasing
   intracellular Cu levels correlated most closely with a concurrent
   decline in intracellular K. Photosynthesis also declined in proportion
   to intracellular Cu; significant Cu-induced stimulation of respiration
   was observed. The most significant effect of Cd treatment was a decline
   in photosynthesis in proportion to the intracellular concentration of
   Cd. Apical segments from both populations showed similar sensitivity to
   Cu, whereas the metal-contaminated population showed increased
   resistance to Cd. Sensitivity to Cd increased in the more basal portions
   of moss gametophores, indicating that apparent resistance of Cd might
   reflect shoot Vitality and age effects. After laboratory growth to
   eliminate differences in the physiological status of apical segments, it
   was confirmed that the metal-contaminated population of the moss was
   photosynthetically more tolerant to Cd at intracellular Cd
   concentrations found to cause considerable photosynthetic inhibition in
   the uncontaminated population. The metal-contaminated population of the
   moss that was tolerant to Cd was not cotolerant to Cu.}},

Abstract = {{Informed management of waterfowl (or any animal population) requires
   management goals and objectives, the ability to implement management
   actions, periodic information about population and goal-related
   variables, and knowledge of effects of management actions on population
   and goal-related variables. In North America, international treaties
   mandate a primary objective of protecting migratory bird populations,
   with a secondary objective of providing hunting opportunity in a manner
   compatible with such protection. Through the years, annual establishment
   of hunting regulations and acquisition and management of habitat have
   been the primary management actions taken by federal agencies. Various
   information-gathering programs were established and, by the 1960s, had
   developed into arguably the best monitoring system in the world for
   continentally distributed animal populations. Retrospective analyses
   using estimates from this monitoring system have been used to
   investigate effects of management actions on waterfowl population and
   harvest dynamics, but key relationships are still characterized by
   uncertainty. We recommend actively adaptive management as an approach
   that can meet short-term harvest objectives, while reducing uncertainty

Abstract = {{Male moths generally find their mates by following the females'
   pheromone plume to its source. A formulated copy of this message is used
   to regulate mating of many important pests, including the pink bollworm
   (Pectinophora gossypiella), the oriental fruit moth (Grapholita
   molesta), and the tomato pinworm (Keiferia lycopersicella). How
   synthetic disruptant interrupts normal orientation is uncertain, but the
   most probable mechanisms invoke adaptation and habituation, competition
   between point sources of formulation and females, and a camouflage of a
   female's pheromone plume by the formulation. The efficacy of this
   technology is related principally to the motility of mated females into
   the area to be managed, the initial population levels of the pest, and
   the release characteristics of the formulation. In most cases,
   implementation of this technology necessitates a sophisticated
   monitoring and management program. Area-wide management schemes are
   ideal vehicles for using disruptants. Future acceptance of this
   environmentally safe control method should increase, largely because of
   growing dissatisfaction with conventional pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{The method of standardized baited pitfall traps for monitoring
   population of Hylobius abietis (L.) was experimentally included into the
   routine planting and control schedule (model area) in the Czech
   Republic. It is recommended to determine characteristics of the area on
   the basis of long-term monitoring. A short-term prognosis per site must
   be drawn from monitoring done from the earliest beginning of the season.
   However, it seems advisable to treat all the individual seedlings
   immediately after they have been planted in the area where the over-all
   characteristics (ascertained by monitoring) indicate generally high
   population levels. To base a decision for treatment on the percentage of
   seedlings attacked (feeding scars) per site is considered unadvisable in
   comparison with data obtained by monitoring using baited pitfall traps.
   Insecticides for the treatment of newly planted seedlings need to be
   applied to two-thirds of the trunk of a seedling (including the root
   collar), their action should be fast enough to paralyse (kill) the
   weevils before they reach xylem by feeding and, furthermore, the
   residues should be effective up to the end of the season.}},

Abstract = {{In April and October mite-free honey-bee colonies were artificially
   infested with 50 individuals of Varroa jacobsoni each and treated with
   the pesticide Apisian(R) after a period of 24 weeks. Population growth
   was studied in 24 colonies from April to October and in 6 colonies from
   October to April. The proportion of Varroa jacobsoni that invaded the
   test colonies after the initial inoculation was monitored in colonies
   that were constantly treated with Apistan(R). Conservative calculations
   suggested that the initial mite population in a honey-bee colony
   increases on average about 300-fold during 1 year in central California.
   This result excludes the contribution of additional mites that invaded
   the colonies. The result of the present study demonstrates the high
   virulence of Varroa jacobsoni in California, where beekeepers are forced
   to treat infested colonies twice a year.}},

Abstract = {{The movement patterns of neotropical African honey bee colonies were

   mtDNA. The latter were classified as Africanized hybrids, ie European
   matrilines mated to African drones. Scout bees performed recruitment
   dances for a mean +/- SD of 12.2 +/- 6.6 different potential nest sites
   located 3 429 +/- 894 m from the swarm clusters. The mean distance
   communicated for the nest site ultimately selected was 4 693 +/- 1 728
   m. Neotropical African and hybrid swarms did not differ in the number of
   nest sites investigated or the mean distances communicated. Swarming
   behavior may account for 6-18\% of the total distance traveled by
   neotropical African bees each year.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to monitor the reproductive cycle of female
   Heterobranchus longifilis under tropical pond conditions in order to
   optimize controlled spawning. Three experimental groups were set up: The
   first group (I) consisted of adult females transferred from their
   natural habitat to ponds. The second experimental group (II) consisted
   of breeders that adapted to husbandry conditions for at least one pear.
   The third set of females (III) was produced under hatchery conditions.
   Females of the natural population served as controls. Over a one year
   period blood samples were taken from the individually marked females on
   a biweekly basis. If ripe eggs were found at the sampling time, females
   were stripped, the eggs were fertilized and hatched artificially. None
   of the feral breeders that were transferred to ponds during their
   natural breeding season could be stripped during that year. The breeding
   season of both groups II and III started in February. Seasonal changes
   in egg output showed a maximum between April and July. Egg production of
   group III was generally higher. The time interval between two strippings
   of the same female was 6 weeks. Viable eggs were obtained from the
   adapted feral breeders until August. whereas the breeding season of the
   hatchery-raised females extended to October. Two thirds of the
   hatchery-raised females were stripped four or more consecutive times.
   Throughout the entire season high hatching rates of normal larvae were
   obtained. Seasonal profiles of the gonadal steroids testosterone and
   estradiol-17 beta reflect the annual changes in sexual activity of
   female Heterobranchus longifilis in tropical pond culture, exhibiting
   maximum values during the breeding times of each group and being lowest
   during resting periods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarises the general findings of the scientific
   contributions to this special issue of Ardea on Cormorant biology in
   Europe. After a brief historical introduction setting the main
   traditional questions that arise whenever man and a species of a
   free-living animal compete for the same resources in the same habitat,
   an overview is given of how Cormorant populations have recovered after
   protective measures were taken over most of Europe. This recovery,
   particularly spectacular in the continental population, has brought the
   species once again into direct conflict with human interests. Research
   has been aimed at unravelling the principal natural factors limiting
   population growth. Surface area, productivity and accessability of
   fishing grounds for breeding birds seem to set the extent to which the
   population may increase but the end of the population growth seems not
   yet to be at hand. Because of their migratory behaviour birds spread all
   over western Europe outside the breeding season, showing often site
   tenacity to stop-over sites as well as predictable migration patterns.
   Factors influencing the non-breeding distribution include age, sex and
   probably individual experience of the birds concerned. Local conflicts
   between human interests and breeding as well as non-breeding Cormorants
   seem impossible to cope with satisfactorily on a local level, without
   consideration of the population as a whole. Not every possible impact of
   Cormorants on fish stocks is bound to be treated as negative: recent
   studies tentatively indicate that the birds may serve as an `aid' to
   fisheries management, keeping eutrophic waters free from dense Bream
   stocks. Finally, the position of top-predator that Cormorants occupy in
   aquatic ecosystems, makes them vulnerable to the accumulation of
   micropollutants. These may hamper breeding success in various ways and,
   in larger concentrations, may even cause death. Monitoring breeding
   success as well as pollutant contents in adult and juvenile Cormorants
   as well as in their eggs may serve as a means to check on trends in
   environmental quality of aquatic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{A suction trap, a rotary trap and water filled tray traps (deposition
   traps) were used to monitor aerial dispersal in a population of spiders
   in and around a field of winter wheat between April and November 1991.
   All three methods proved adequate for describing trends in aerial
   activity during this period. Suction trapping and rotary sampling were
   less labour intensive than using deposition traps and provided the
   facility to record daily fluctuation in activity. Deposition traps had
   the advantage that they could be left unattended for longer periods of
   time. The main factor affecting the efficiency of the rotor trap was
   considered to be the vertical velocities of ballooning spiders.
   Calibration of the rotor trap was attempted but the difficulties of
   accurately assessing the number of spiders ballooning from an area of
   ground rendered this task problematical. A method of assessing the
   effects of aerial dispersal on the density of spiders on the ground is
   presented. This method relied on inclusion caging to prevent dispersal
   and was only partially successful due to statistical problems resulting
   from the aggregated dispersion of spiders in the field. There was no
   indication from this study of any targe net immigration or emigration of
   spiders from the field.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of an investigation of the application
   of chlorophyll fluorescence perturbations as a bioassay for nutrient
   limitation in microalgae. The variable chlorophyll fluorescence (Delta
   F) response of Microcystis aeruginosa, chemostatically cultured under
   different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrient regimes, to spiking
   with NO3-, NH4+ and PO43- was monitored. Differences were observed in
   the short-term (<10 min) fluorescence response (F) which related to the
   original nutrient status of the test organism. Cells growing
   exponentially in full nutrient media showed no transient changes in
   Delta F. The addition of NH4+ or NO3- to N-limited cells resulted in
   transient changes to Delta F, while no response was observed following
   the addition of PO43-. Spiking of P-limited cells with either PO43- or
   NH4+ resulted in transient changes to Delta F, while no response was
   observed for NO3-. Thus a simple, rapid, nutrient-specific assay for
   nutrient limitation was available for cultured cells of M. aeruginosa.
   When the assay was tested on field samples from the Maude Weir Pool (34
   degrees 28'S,144 degrees 18'E), Murrumbidgee River, NSW, Australia,
   apparent nutrient limitation, either N or P, was detected. Use of
   microalgal fluorescence responses to nutrient spiking may allow the
   rapid and specific detection of nutrient limitation in both cultures and
   field populations of phytoplankton.}},

   nutans L. in the southern part of ifs native European distribution was
   studied as part of a biological control programme against this weed for
   Australia. Surveys were conducted from Spain to Greece to parallel
   previous studies in central Europe and three populations of the weed
   were monitored in detail over a 2-4-year period in southern France. The
   damage levels and attack patterns of each insect species were recorded
   The most common species damaging the roots and meristems were the
   weevils Hadroplontus (= Ceutorhynchus) trimaculatus F. and
   Trichosirocalus horridus Panzer and the syrphid fly Cheilosia corydon
   Harris (= grossa Fallen). In manipulative experiments, made to assess
   their impact on the host plant, C. corydon reduced seed production by up
   to 45\%, while the two weevils mainly altered plant architecture. The
   results are discussed in relation to previous experience of using root
   feeders for the biological control of G. nutans.}},

Abstract = {{The aphid, Aphis chloris Koch, quickly established following field
   release at numerous sites throughout south-eastern Australia. Local
   populations built up to levels at which migratory alates were produced
   within the first season. Dispersal of these alates over large distances
   led to widespread colonization of st John's wort infested areas within
   2-3 years. Detailed observations at the primary release sire at Pierce's
   Creek, ACT, showed that aphid populations undergo a seasonal cycle of
   population growth throughout the summer, followed by a migratory phase
   with alate production and dispersal in autumn and a population decline
   over winter. This pattern was repeated at other release sites monitored
   over a 5-year period from 1987 to 1991 inclusive, without populations
   building up to damaging levels. Natural enemies, competition from
   existing biological control agents, climatic factors and emigration
   appear sufficient to limit such outbreaks. While caged plants did show a
   decline in vigour and seed production under heavy aphid attack, such
   damage was intermittent in open field situations. The present study
   suggests that while A. chloris is now widespread, it will not make an
   important contribution to the overall control of St John's wort.}},

Abstract = {{A discriminate analysis, based opt the frequencies of, occurrence of six
   random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments, distinguished
   individuals of a pesticide-resistant laboratory biotype (SEL) of the
   walnut aphid parasite, Trioxys pallidus Haliday (Hymenoptera:
   Aphidiidae), from individuals of a wild orchard `biotype (RB). In mixed
   populations in the laboratory, the SEL biotype was heavily favored,
   irrespective of pesticide treatment suggesting a high degree of
   laboratory adaptation. The resistance levels in untreated and
   pesticide-treated mixed (SEL + RB) populations were not different after
   eight generations. Analyses of RAPD-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data
   suggested that the selective advantage of the SEL biotype may have been
   aided by a partial mating incompatibility between the biotypes. The data
   can be explained by either of two types of reproductive incompatibility:
   (1) RB females mating with SEL males produced only male offspring; or
   (2) the RB biotype could not successfully find mates under laboratory
   conditions. Successful discrimination of T. pallidus biotypes and their
   hybrid progeny in population cages suggests that RAPD-PCR offers a
   method to determine the fate of the pesticide-resistant SEL biotype
   after release into orchards populated by the RB biotype.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms in free-living populations are normally subjected to stressful
   environments, especially hydrological extremes followed by nutritional
   inadequacy. Although adaptation to increased desiccation stress can
   occur, reduced fitness is a cost restricting the potential for spread
   into extreme habitats. Selection for stress resistance should be
   lower-in captive populations reducing survival on release into
   free-living conditions. Therefore in developing protocols to promote
   conservation I recommend monitoring stress response traits of direct
   ecological importance emphasizing outlier populations close to
   extinction. This approach gains support from evidence that genetic
   variability in some stressed outlier populations is not lacking but may
   be enhanced.}},

Abstract = {{Trawling for penaeid prawns has been suggested to have major effects on
   the size of sea populations in Australia and overseas. The numbers of
   turtles caught and killed in the Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl
   Fishery were estimated from a 2-year programme monitoring turtle
   captures in this commercial prawn trawl fishery. A sample of about 50
   commercial fishers participated and reported an average catch rate of
   0.068 turtles per day fished. Loggerhead Caretta caretta (50.4\%), green
   Chelonia mydas (30.1\%) and flatback Natator depressus (10.9\%) turtles
   comprised the main species caught. An estimated 5295 +/- 1231 turtles
   were caught annually by the Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery,
   which has an annual fishing effort of 80,558 days. About 1.1\% of
   captured turtles were reported dead when landed. This mortality rate is
   lower than those reported for other trawl fisheries because in the
   Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery tow durations are short (<80
   min) where turtles are commonly caught. Potentially, if all comatose
   turtles are assumed to die, the mortality rate of trawl caught turtles
   could be as high as 6.8\%. However, the true mortality rate is probably
   somewhere between 1.1\% and 6.8\% of turtles landed because some
   commercial fishers resuscitate trawl-caught turtles.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of rates of decline for butterflies in the British county of

   of decline based on a 2 km grid are likely to be underestimates because
   pre-1970 records are incomplete and because 2 km grid squares still

   location of every local population is known in North Wales, a 2 km grid
   would seriously underestimate declines, for example giving only a 56\%
   loss of grid squares if 90\% of local populations were to become
   extinct. Our results and analysis of simulated distributions indicate
   that: for a few of the very rarest species, declines on grid maps may
   closely reflect population losses, for species of intermediate rarify,
   grid maps identify but underestimate population losses; for common
   species, population losses fail to be detected on grid maps.
   Per-population extinction rates for butterflies of intermediate rarity,
   and even for some relatively or very common species, may have been as
   high as extinction rates for some of the rarest. Because most of the
   commoner species initially had many populations per grid square, their
   declines have been under estimated or have not been detected by existing
   mapping schemes. We propose a scheme for monitoring changes in the
   status of common as well as rare butterflies in a network of intensively
   mapped grid squares at different scales.}},

Abstract = {{Lesser kestrels Falco naumanni were surveyed using repeatable methods in
   central Turkey in spring 1993 which produced a population estimate of
   1500-3500 pairs. Lesser kestrel abundance was significantly related to
   flat topography and a model predicted a population of 2550 pairs in
   habitats dominated by cereal agriculture, dry and wet grasslands and
   marshes. This is the second largest recorded population in the world and
   therefore of high conservation value. Evidence suggested the population
   was declining, probably due to increased pesticide use. Monitoring of
   agricultural change using remotely sensed data and repeat bird surveys
   is required. Conservation measures should involve the selection of
   Important Bird Areas; within these, the maintenance of traditional
   farming methods and conservation of existing semi-natural vegetation
   should be encouraged.}},

Volume = {{72}},

Pages = {{99-107}},
Abstract = {{Electric fences and other barriers to prevent movement of elephants onto
   arable land are increasingly important conservation tools in Africa, as
   elephant populations become isolated by areas of increasing human
   settlement. In Laikipia District in Kenya, crop raining by elephants is
   a serious problem, and many different types of elephant barriers have
   been built over the last 30 years. In order to assess the importance of
   different design factors, an experimental fence was built along the
   boundary of Ol Ari Nyiro Ranch in western Laikipia in 1992, and the
   response of the elephants was monitored.
   Comparison of different fences showed that there was no clear
   relationship between effectiveness of fences, and factors such as
   design, construction and voltage. Some high-specification fences have
   proved ineffective against elephants, while other simple fences have
   worked well for a long period. The previous experience of elephants with
   electric fences in a particular area, and shooting of fence-breaker as
   are considered to be more important than any design criteria. Electric
   fences should be thought of as demarcations of `no-go' areas for
   elephants rather than as real physical barriers, and conservation
   efforts should concentrate more on improved active management, rather
   than attempting to design fences that are effective under all
   circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{A study of grizzly bears Ursus arctos horribilis in the Cabinet
   Mountains, Montana indicated that the future of the population was in
   jeopardy, and population augmentation was recommended.  The US Fish and
   Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued an augmentation plan in 1987.  The first
   of four projected transplants was completed in July 1990.  The first
   transplanted grizzly bear was a 5-year-old female that weighed 71 kg. 
   The first bear remained in the Cabinet Mountains following release and
   was monitored for 13 months before the radio collar was lost.  This bear
   was visually located in the target area on 15 May 1992 approximately 19
   km from the release site.  Her home range from July 1990 through May
   1992 encompassed 555 km2.  Data regarding movements and habitat use were
   analysed and compared with native grizzly bears in the Cabinet
   Mountains.  Trapping efforts in southeast British Columbia for
   additional bears to transplant were again conducted in 1991 and 1992. 
   The effort resulted in the capture of eight different grizzly bears in
   1991, but none met the sex and age criteria of 2-6-year-old females. 
   Efforts in 1992 resulted in the capture of a second 71 kg 6-year-old
   female (bear 258) which was released at the same location as the first
   bear exactly 2 years later on 22 July 1992.  Movements of bear 258 from
   July through November 1992 encompassed 388 km2 in the target release
   area.  This second bear emerged with a single cub in May 1993 and was
   radio-monitored until July 1993 when it was found dead in the target
   release area.  No trace of the cub was found although it had been seen
   with its mother in late June.  The cause of death is as yet unknown
   pending completion of toxicology reports.  A third subadult female bear
   (286) was captured in July 1993 and released in the target area where
   she has remained through October 1993.  Transplanting of bears can be a
   valuable tool in the conservation of small bear populations worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Research and development of insect pheromones for forest pest management
   has been underway for 15 years. Pheromones offer a particularly unique
   approach to pest management because they often affect critical behaviors
   associated with the reproductive process i.e., mating, oviposition, host
   feeding, and host finding. There are several general tactics or
   strategies used when utilizing insect pheromones for forest pest
   management purposes: (1) monitoring; (2) mass trapping; (3) mating
   disruption; (4) antiaggregation. Development of population management
   strategies for lepidopterous pests has concentrated on using the mating
   disruption strategy. Whereas with Scolytidae (bark beetles) research has
   been focused primarily on development of antiaggregation pheromones. A
   major hurdle in deploying pheromones in forested environments has been
   the lack of efficient and effective formulation and delivery systems.
   Lastly, as with other pesticides, pheromones used in mitigating the
   effects of pest are regulated by the US-EPA's registration process.}},

Abstract = {{Despite advances in mycorrhizal identification, the goal of elucidating
   the structure and development of mycorrhizal communities remains
   elusive. Fruit body production can be sporadic, morphological typing of
   mycorrhizae is subject to variation with environmental conditions or
   host, and cultural studies are labor intensive and miss fungi that
   cannot be isolated. Molecular techniques for identification of fungal
   symbionts can supplement these techniques and offer an approach that is
   rapid, is independent of environmental variation, and can be applied
   directly to large numbers of samples. Molecular approaches to
   mycorrhizal community analysis attempt to distinguish taxonomic groups
   so they can be monitored and their interactions studied. Initial
   characterization of community structure involves enzymatic amplification
   of DNA directly from mycorrhizal roots using fungus-specific primers,
   followed by restriction endonuclease digestion to produce taxon-specific
   restriction fragment patterns. Comparison of these patterns with those
   obtained from fungal fruit bodies or reference cultures facilitates
   identification of fungal symbionts. Phylogenetic relationships of fungi
   that cannot be matched to reference isolates can be inferred by
   sequencing enzymatically amplified DNA. Future directions that will
   result from molecular approaches include development of sampling
   strategies, resolution of species complexes, field observations of host
   specificity, elucidation of the dynamics of replacement processes
   (succession), and determination of the role of dispersal in community
   development. As additional techniques are developed for population
   analysis, resolution of questions related to genetic structure,

Abstract = {{Although Pea Patch Island in the upper Delaware Bq has been the site of
   a large assemblage of nesting Ciconiiforms since the early 1970's,
   abundance estimates were inadequate to guide wildlife management
   planning, and no recent information on productivity was available. I
   conducted abundance surveys and nest studies of the 12,000 pair colony
   in 1993. Abundance estimates were obtained through ground-based nest
   counts, counts of attending adults, and aerial surveys. I determined
   wading bird productivity through regular visits to colony subareas to
   follow the success of marked nests. Nine species of Ciconiiforms nested
   in the colony, 82\% of which utilized reed marsh areas for nesting
   substrate. Monitored species that showed poor reproductive success
   compared to other Atlantic coast colonies were Snowy Egret, Cattle
   Egret, and Glossy Ibis. In contrast, Little Blue Heron showed normal
   reproductive success on Pea Patch Island. Egg predation, egg
   inviability, and nestling starvation were the most important factors of
   offspring mortality. Nestling growth of all species except Snowy Egret
   was comparable to other studies. Pea Patch Island has hosted a
   significant proportion of the Atlantic coast populations of wading birds
   for twenty years and continues as a wildlife resource of national
   importance.}},

Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{25}},

Pages = {{201-268}},
Abstract = {{Representing toxicant-induced changes in biological systems, biomarkers
   can serve as linkers between contamination (cause) and biological
   effects, and therefore provide unique information on ecosystem health.
   Hence, they are increasingly used for assessing the exposure of
   organisms to environmental contamination. Here, application of the
   induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), certainly the best studied
   biomarker, in field trials with freshwater and marine fish is reviewed.
   Moreover, the use of a number of other biomarkers, alone or in concert
   with CYP1A, is evaluated. Determination of CYP1A in field studies with
   fish has to consider several influencing factors, such as species, age,
   reproductive stage, temperature, and possible inhibitors. The overview
   shows that CYP1A induction is significantly related to contaminant
   levels in the environment in 93\% of the investigated field studies. It
   is apparent that only certain classes of xenobiotica act as inducers of
   CYP1A (e.g., PAHs, coplanar PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and
   dibenzodioxins). Induction of CYP1A was found to be more sensitive than
   other biomarkers at the biochemical, cellular, organ, and population
   level. Thus, induction of CYP1A can serve as a powerful tool for
   assessing environmental contamination and health, and its measurement,
   preferably together with other biomarkers and chemical analysis, is
   strongly recommended in monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals killed by predators often are considered to be in poorer
   physical condition than those not killed, but little work has been done
   on behavioural differences between the two. We monitored the behaviour,
   movements and survival of 15 juvenile red squirrels (Tamiasciurus
   hudsonicus) from the first day of their emergence through late summer to
   determine behavioural characteristics associated with predation.
   Individuals which spent relatively less time vigilant, less time
   resting, and more time in exposed locations were more likely to be
   depredated. The distance moved by an individual during observation
   periods was not related to its survival. but individuals that spent
   relatively more time off their natal territory were more likely to be
   depredated. Adult red squirrels spent significantly less time in exposed
   places than juveniles, which may relate to the lower depredation rates
   experienced by adults.}},

Title = {{INITIAL PHASE OF POSTFIRE FOREST REGENERATION IN 2 LICHEN WOODLANDS OF
   NORTHERN QUEBEC}},
Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{177-183}},
Abstract = {{A five-year postfire monitoring of forest floor regeneration, black
   spruce (Picea mariana {[}Mill.] BSP) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana
   Lamb.) seed dispersal, germination and seedling establishment was
   performed in a black spruce and in a jack pine lichen woodland of the
   upper boreal forest in northern Quebec. The plant species present before
   the fire and able to resprout vegetatively were the fastest to
   regenerate. The slower regeneration of the spruce stand forest floor
   probably resulted from deeper combustion of the organic layer which
   killed most potentially meristematic organs of species which otherwise
   might have regenerated. The total seed dispersal over the five-year
   postfire monitoring period in the spruce stand reached 1 700 886/ha and
   270.830/ha for black spruce and jack pine, respectively. In the pine
   stand, these values were in the same order: 216 011/ha and 298 883/ha.
   The spatial pattern of seed dispersal was generally contagious. The
   number of seeds dispersed decreased during the last trapping periods,
   suggesting that seed banks were becoming exhausted. Likewise, seed
   viability dropped markedly over time. These temporal patterns of seed
   dispersal and viability fit the predictions of Wilton's model. Despite a
   lower total seed input, jack pine established at a higher density than
   black spruce, particularly on charred organic seedbeds. Seedling
   establishment success observed in this study and elsewhere suggests that
   this parameter has been probably underestimated in simulation models of
   the dynamics of the northeastern Canadian lichen woodland.}},

Abstract = {{Fates of antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) seeds were monitored
   from the time the seeds were cached by yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias
   amoenus) until they germinated nine months later. One thousand seeds
   were numbered and then radioactively labelled with scandium-46 so that
   the histories of individual seeds could be followed. The labelled seeds
   were placed under a bitterbrush shrub in the morning and by that evening
   chipmunks had gathered most of the seeds and made 110 primary caches
   within 16 m of the source shrub. During the fall, chipmunks and other
   rodents visited many of these caches and removed some of the seeds.
   Thirty-one caches completely disappeared, 28 other caches had some but
   not all of the seeds removed, and 51 caches remained intact until the
   time of seed germination. Chipmunks recached about 30\% of the seeds
   they took from primary caches during the late summer and fall at 12
   secondary and two tertiary cache sites. The histories of seeds were
   often complicated. Seeds survived to the time of germination at 86 of
   the 124 cache sites (79 primary caches, six secondary caches, and one
   tertiary cache). The population of caches from a particular source plant
   is dynamic. Seed-hoarding animals frequently move seeds from one storage
   site to another, and this secondary dispersal has important consequences
   for the seeds being moved.}},

Title = {{A simple monitoring method of moth larvae (Lepidoptera) on Norway spruce
   in the Tatra Biosphere Reserve}},
Journal = {{EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Abstract = {{In chosen monitoring areas 10 terminal parts of branches (1 m long) are
   taken from the lower spruce canopy (defined as a ground level up to 3 m)
   at the end of winter and then transported in plastic bags into the
   laboratory. Moth larvae or adults are obtained through photoeclectors.
   After the branches being dried up the weight and number of all needles
   are determined. The described method possesses several advantages: a
   simplicity, a minimum impact on insect populations, a clearly defined
   phenological period, a repeatability of the methods and a comparability
   of the results. it also aims at obtaining all the species occurring on
   spruce in this phenological period. Cutting off ten branches from each
   monitoring area every year and possible injury to moth larvae
   (especially those of Geometridae) in the course of handling the branches
   may be considered as its main disadvantage. In the first two years of
   monitoring in the Tatra Biosphere Reserve (6 monitoring areas)
   altogether 12 moth species were obtained as well as another taxon that
   comprising two hardly distinguishable species. Ten investigated branches
   contained approximately from 400,000 up to 500,000 needles. The larvae
   burrowing in buds and shoots were more frequent at middle and higher
   elevations (closely to the timber line). In contrast, the larvae living
   in webs between needles and/or the mining species prevailed at a lower
   elevation (from 900 to 1000 m a.s.l.).}},

   BY A HARBOR IMPOUNDMENT SCHEME}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{197-204}},
Abstract = {{A long-term monitoring programme of water and sediment quality is being
   undertaken before, during, and after the impoundment of Sutton Harbour,
   Plymouth (UK). The impoundment scheme protects an area of the city from
   periodic flooding, but harbour access is allowed via a lock. The water
   replacement times have increased from 45 h to 72 h, at springs, with a
   consequent effect on the retention of pollutants from internal and
   external sources. The monitoring programme involved determination of
   essential variables (viz temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH,
   chlorophyll a, and suspended particulate matter, SPM, concentration)
   coupled with nutrients, faecal bacteria, trace metals in the water
   column and sediments, and benthic fauna. The results show that before
   impoundment, the Harbour had an annual cycle in biogeochemical variables
   that was perturbed only by intermittent meteorological events. The
   Harbour is contaminated with heavy metals; the permanently anoxic
   sediments show relatively high concentrations of mercury (0.5-2.0 mg
   kg(-1)) and cadmium (1.0-5.0 mg kg(-1)). During construction,
   significant variations were observed in bacterial distributions, heavy
   metal concentrations, and benthic fauna populations. The trends are
   discussed in terms of a management strategy for maintaining water and
   sediment quality, especially those aspects that have more general
   applications to other harbour impoundment projects.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{331-337}},
Abstract = {{One hundred and nine healthy subjects living in an urban area of Tuscany
   were monitored using sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis on
   lymphocytes cultured in standard or alpha-naphthoflavone
   (ANF)-supplemented medium in order to collect the most complete data
   possible for those constitutional and environmental factors with which
   genotoxic risk can be associated. ANF genotoxicity depends on its
   metabolic activation by cellular P-450 monooxygenase systems whose
   activity can be modulated by exposure to carcinogenic but nongenotoxic
   xenobiotics. Lymphocytes grown in standard conditions showed a
   significant increase of SCE frequency associated with smoking habits and
   age. Although the addition of ANF caused an upward shift of SCE
   frequency in all subjects, smokers, coffee drinkers, and blue-collar
   workers showed a significantly higher SCE level; this suggests that
   potential risk factors rising from a modified cell metabolism are
   present in these categories. These results indicate that in vitro ANF
   treatment of lymphocytes could be a useful tool in the detection of
   environmental exposure to those classes of chemicals involved in
   metabolic activation of promutagens. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The original idea for this article was to examine the new molecular
   techniques for detection of mutation directly at the DNA level in
   exposed individuals or their offspring and to assess their relative
   advantages and disadvantages for mutation monitoring in humans and
   rodents. However, on examination of the articles and a comparison of the
   technology indicated that our constant quests for methods improvement
   were leading to some loss of insight into the important health-related
   questions that should be guiding these endeavors. As a result,
   individual methods are not covered here in great technical detail.
   Instead, a few molecular methods are presented in a general overview,
   along with some of the biological issues related to the detection of
   induced mutations within individuals and populations. Some hypothetical
   scenarios are also presented because molecular ap proaches will continue
   to change rapidly, and we must continually adjust our thinking to
   combine the useful attributes of each current and future technical
   approach with the most appropriate biological questions. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental
   Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) will monitor the nation's
   resources by evaluating the status and trends of selected indicators of
   condition using a probability-based sampling design. The EMAP-Wetlands
   program will monitor the condition of the nation's wetlands. The EMAP
   classification system is an aggregation of the many subclasses of the US
   Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory (NWI)
   classification system. This aggregation results in fewer wetland classes
   with more wetlands per class than the NWI system. Aggregation of the NWI
   classification was based primarily on dominant vegetation cover,
   flooding regimes, dominant water source, and adjacency to rivers and
   lakes. We evaluated the EMAP classification system and sampling design
   using NWI digital wetlands data for portions of Illinois, Washington,
   North Dakota, and South Dakota. Relative numbers of wetlands, total
   areas, average areas, and common versus rare classes were compared
   between the EMAP and NWI classification systems. As expected, the EMAP
   classification provided fewer wetland polygons, each with larger areas,
   without altering total wetland area. Summary statistics comparing sample
   estimates to true population parameters (represented by the NWI data)
   demonstrated the effectiveness of the EMAP sampling design with the
   exception of rare EMAP classes in the selected regions. Although simple
   random sampling is inadequate for both targe and small wetlands, the
   EMAP sampling design is readily adapted to provide better estimates for
   these categories. Aggregating the NWI classification to the EMAP
   classification provides fewer wetland classes, with more wetlands per
   class, for EMAP's annual reports and statistical summaries.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of American black ducks have declined and if has been
   hypothesized that wetland acidification, which can alter food quality by
   increasing availability of cadmium and decreasing that of calcium, may
   have contributed. We tested whether low-level cadmium and reduced
   calcium intake affect tissue cadmium concentrations and behaviour of
   captive black ducks. Adults received diets that mimicked cadmium and
   calcium concentrations in invertebrate prey from acid and from
   circumneutral wetlands for three spring and slimmer months in 1991 and
   1992. Behaviours were monitored both when birds were fed experimental
   diets and control (commercial) diets. Cadmium in kidneys and liver
   differed significantly among groups and low calcium facilitated cadmium
   uptake. After two breeding seasons, levels of accumulated Cd were not
   lethal. However, birds that received Cd were significantly more active
   than control birds. Increased activity may have implications for
   survival of birds in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{Microcystin-LR (MCLR) is a cyclic hepatotoxin and tumor promotor
   produced by some freshwater cyanobacteria. The occurrence of
   microcystin-containing blooms in freshwater has been implicated in
   animal and human poisonings worldwide. To assess the fate of MCLR in a
   heterotrophic microbial population, purified MCLR was incubated with a
   microbial community orginating from the Edmonton wastewater treatment
   plant. After 10 days of aerobic incubation, a significant decrease in
   MCLR concentration was observed. Analysis of the culture supernatant by
   highperformance liquid chromatograph, monitoring absorbance at 210 and
   238 nm, suggested that the heptapeptide ring of MCLR and its Adda group
   had been modified, respectively. The transformed product(s) of MCLR,
   unlike the parent toxin, did not inhibit protein phosphatase activity.
   There was no difference in the bacterial counts in effluent spiked with
   MCLR as compared with effluent without MCLR. Based on first-order
   kinetics, the half-life of MCLR under our laboratory conditions ranged
   from 0.2 to 3.6 d.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive research over the past 10 years has produced many
   genetically-modified lines of oilseed rape with market potential.
   Assessment of these lines in statutory trials prior to their release as
   cultivars is necessary, owing to concern over the likelihood of
   transgene escape from such crops. Here, we examine the movement of
   airborne pollen grains from oilseed rape fields and assess their
   capacity for long-range geneflow.
   Pollen dispersal from isolated rape fields was monitored over two
   seasons and related to the distribution of fields and `feral'
   (domesticated plants growing outside cultivations) populations of the
   crop in Tayside and North East Fife regions of Scotland. Airborne pollen
   density declined with distance and at 360 m was 10\% of that at the
   field margin. Pollen counts of 0-22 pollen grains m(3) were observed 1.5
   km from source fields and apparently were sufficient in number to allow
   seed set on emasculated bait plants. Oilseed rape pollen has greater
   capacity for long-range dispersal than had been suggested by small-scale
   field trials. Mean separation of oilseed rape fields in the survey area
   was 410 m and the mean distance from `feral' populations to commercial
   fields was 700 m. Sixty percent of `feral' populations with more than 10
   plants occurred downwind and within 2 km of an oilseed rape field.
   Provided that the flowering biology of genetically-modified oilseed rape
   does not differ from the conventional crop, these data suggest that
   transgene movement to non genetically-modified fields or `feral'
   populations is likely following commercial release.}},

Abstract = {{The reactions and behaviours of the nematode fauna in an acid mull of a
   deciduous forest (State Forest of Orleans, France) have been monitored
   for four years in the course of an experimental deprivation and doubling
   of annual litter supplies as well as of a deprivation of litter and
   rain-leaching arrivals. The deprivation of litter rapidly entails, from
   the year following the withholding, a regression in the density of the
   populations, firstly at surface (0-3 cm) then at depth (- 3-10 cm), as
   well as a modification in the intensity of the two seasonal activity
   peaks. In contrast to the other trophic groups, the density of the plant
   feeder nematodes increases during the two years after the litter
   withholding. Furthermore, a different behaviour in the animal activity
   at the surface and at depth occurs. As part of the two-fold litter
   supply, in addition to a decrease of the density of the nematode fauna,
   we have observed an enhancement of the dominance of fungal feeder
   nematodes compared to bacterial feeder nematodes, a particular trend of
   the level (- 1-3 cm) that behaves, in the beginning of the experiment,
   as a surface level (0-1 cm) then evolves like a depth level (- 3-6 cm
   and - 6-10 cm), thus emphasizing the surface-depth imbalance in the
   vertical animal distribution. Also we have pointed out an increase of
   the density of Cephalobidae and Plectidae contrarily to the other
   bacterial feeder nematodes. The experiment of litter and rain-leaching
   arrival deprivation has allowed us to give some elements of comparison
   in situ on the nematode resistance to a deficient soil hydric regime but
   also on the aptitude and rapidity of some species to react when the
   environmental conditions become favourable again; then the ecological
   significance of the behaviour of the colonizing bacterial feeder species
   is discussed. Referring to a previous experiment of litter supply
   withholding and literature data (clear-cutting soil acidification,
   nematode behaviour in desert soils) the authors draw attention to the
   role of the litter and the underground vegetative system on the
   maintenance of the biological activity and on the organization of the
   nematode populations. Furthermore the role of these animals as potential
   indicators of the environmental conditions is emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Marine biological monitoring programmes frequently attempt to determine
   `'safe'' levels of contamination, based on assumptions about the
   assimilative capacity of the environment. This paper argues that such
   assumptions lack scientific rigour, and do not form the basis upon which
   a precautionary policy can be built. It notes the problems associated
   with assessing toxicological effects, but centres its attention on the
   crucial (yet far less discussed) weaknesses in theoretical ecology that
   make it extremely unlikely that biological monitoring can determine safe
   levels of contamination that leave ecosystems unaffected. It is argued
   that many marine biologists, if pressed, would concede these
   shortcomings but believe that, in the face of the technical difficulties
   and high costs of pollution prevention,. we have no choice but to use
   such methods. This paper argues, with examples, that pollution
   prevention, often with considerable economic savings, is becoming a
   reality for even the most problematic substances. The difficulty is that
   the development of `'clean production'' methods lie outside the sphere
   of interest of those carrying out monitoring, so that measures that
   attempt to determine safe levels of contamination continue to be
   advocated. This gulf needs to be bridged so that the continuation of
   monitoring programmes that are part of dilute and disperse policies
   become regarded as inappropriate, indeed unethical. The paper concludes
   that this does not mean the end of marine monitoring. Instead, reliable
   methods for assessing physical levels of contamination will be required
   to determine whether the reduction targets set - as part of the
   introduction of clean production - are being met. Formidable
   difficulties will remain, requiring a precautious approach.
   Nevertheless, monitoring will no longer carry the burden of attempting
   to demonstrate that a particular level of environmental contamination is
   safe, which is currently destroying its scientific credibility.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of large populations of common frogs Rana temporaria
   and common toads Bufo bufo was monitored for six years in a
   newly-created reserve, following stocking with spawn of both species and
   with toads rescued from a site to be destroyed.  Frog spawn output
   reached a peak three years after the initial introduction.  There was
   high mortality and/or emigration (64\% loss) during the first year
   following translocation of over 5,000 adult male toads.  Thereafter male
   mortality decreased and/or site fidelity increased:  39\% loss year 2 to
   3, 42\% loss year 3 to 4.  Comparable data were not available for the
   795 females translocated, but there is no reason to believe their
   mortality was lower.  Transfer of spawn is probably more effective as a
   means of establishing a new population of toads than transfer of adults.
   Counts of male toads peaked after three years, but delayed sexual
   maturity of females meant that counts of pairs and estimates of spawn
   output continued to increase for about six years.  Age determination in
   a sample of 43 male toads showed that length was significantly related
   to age, but there were some notably disparate rates of growth.  A sample
   of 16 females showed no correlation between age and length.  The
   greatest recorded losses of naturally-laid spawn of both species (up to
   16\% in one year for the frog and 39\% for the toad) were due to
   desiccation, presumed collection by people and fungal infestation.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to monitor bird populations both in their own right and
   as indicators of the general health of wildlife habitats. The objectives
   of the British Trust for Omithology's Integrated Population Monitoring
   programme relate to breeding bird populations in Britain and Ireland and
   involve the estimation of demographic parameters as well as assessment
   of numbers. Current programmes for monitoring bird numbers cover the
   majority of British species; it would be feasible to monitor most of the
   rest. A new Breeding Bird Survey has been developed to provide effective
   coverage of all regions and all major habitats in Britain through random
   sampling, allowing for the marked geographical variation in volunteer
   observer density. The final choice of a random sample stratified by
   observer density (with some professional support in regions with few
   volunteer observers) was based on comparison with alternative
   stratifications, using data from a 2-year pilot study to assess the
   number of species adequately covered under various alternatives. A
   method of assessing whether or not targets are being achieved at any
   time has been developed: it involves looking back through the data at
   intervals of 1-year, 4-year, 16-year and longer spans. It will be
   possible to refine this by incorporating environmental and
   density-dependent effects into predictive models. The method is
   illustrated here using Common Birds Census data. We discuss associated
   problems of statistical inference and of taking decisions under
   uncertainty. The data provide evidence for large declines in some
   species, particularly in farmland; the value of birds as general
   indicators of habitat health is clear. The results of monitoring can be
   used to illuminate possible causes of problems and to guide both
   practical steps to ameliorate the problems and research aimed at better
   understanding the causes. Examples of such research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The longest available bag record of Grey Partridges Perdix perdix in
   Great Britain (1793-1993) reveals a collapse of stocks after 1952
   despite considerable annual variation. The annual fluctuations were
   attributable largely to annual variations in chick survival rate. The
   Game Conservancy Trust's National Game Census revealed that chick
   survival rates averaged 49\% before the introduction of herbicides and
   32\% once their use became widespread. On a study area in Sussex, where
   spring density declined from around 21 pairs per km(2) in 1968 to under
   four pairs per km(2) in 1993, annual chick survival rates averaged 28\%
   with no demonstrable trend, The annual over-winter `'survival'' rates in
   the area improved during 1968-1993, whereas brood production rates
   declined, Simulation modelling showed that a reduction in chick survival
   rate from 49\% to 32\% had little effect on spring stocks as long as
   nest predation was controlled but that stocks collapsed when nest
   predation control was relaxed. The effect of such a change in chick
   survival rate on population status was investigated by reference to 36
   other studies in the literature. Amongst 20 studied populations which
   were stable, adjusting mean chick survival rates downwards produced
   demographic parameters characteristic of declining populations in all
   but two cases, Conversely, adjusting chick survival rates upwards for 16
   declining populations made all but two stable. Diagnosing and remedying
   the causes of population change require a testable understanding of
   density-dependent factors and compensatory processes, best approached by
   a combination of monitoring, modelling and management.}},

Abstract = {{The Biodiversity Convention requires parties to prepare national plans
   with strategies for the conservation of biodiversity. The U.K. produced
   its Action Plan in January 1994, one of the first countries to do so,
   The document of nearly 200 pages sets out the rationale for conserving
   biodiversity and the U.K. scientific tradition which underpins our
   understanding of biodiversity and describes in very summary form the key
   characteristics of U.K. biodiversity and the resources we devote to
   sustaining it, both in situ and ex situ, as well as our contribution to
   assisting conservation outside the U.K. It goes on to consider the role
   of education and public information and the need to improve the
   coordination and accessibility of scientific data and monitoring.
   Finally, it sets out a range of targets and commitments including a
   proposal to set up machinery, involving non-governmental interests, to
   agree on specific targets for key species and habitats in 1995. The main
   emphasis of the Plan and the work ahead is to create a collaborative
   framework for the large but fragmented efforts by the public voluntary
   sectors to reverse recent losses of biodiversity. In many ways bird
   conservation and population monitoring provide a benchmark for other
   species work, Bird conservation will benefit from the increased
   integration of effort and scientific analysis which looks at the
   interaction of species, habitats and wider land use issues and the
   effect of sectoral policies such as agriculture, energy and transport,}},

Abstract = {{Populations of tobacco thrips (Frankliniella fusca) and western flower
   thrips, (F. occidentalis), which are known vectors of tomato spotted
   wilt virus (TSWV), were monitored along with spotted wilt epidemics in
   peanuts that had been treated with various insecticides from 1988 to
   1995. Treatments comprised various systemic insecticides applied
   in-furrow, at-planting, as foliar sprays, or as combinations of these
   methods on two cultivars. All insecticides gave good control of thrips
   larvae but only fair control of adults. Most insecticide treatments had
   significantly more F. occidentalis adults within 48 clays after planting
   and during flowering. Although incidence of spotted wilt disease was
   lower on variety Southern Runner than on Florunner, these reductions
   were nor significantly, different. In all cases, the variety effect on
   final incidence of spotted wilt was larger than the insecticide effect.
   With season-long weekly sprays, the reduction in spotted wilt was about
   50\%. The effects of insecticides on thrips populations and subsequent
   progress of disease epidemics are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable attention has been given lately to the effects of habitat
   fragmentation and destruction on wildlife. Here, we summarize their
   effects on animal abundance and plant cover during a three-year study
   period (1987-90) of the sand dunes of the coastal plain of Israel.
   Populations of the gray monitor Varanus griseus, the spur-thighed
   tortoise Testudo graeca, and the mountain gazelle Gazella gazella in the
   study area declined markedly and plant cover increased significantly.
   Habitat destruction and fragmentation, introduced animals (especially
   dogs and carrion crows), a continuing change in the native herbivore
   fauna, and blockage of wind-borne sand are all believed to be
   responsible for the observed changes. We recommend that small areas,
   unsuitable for full protection, be declared `'city reserves,'' to be
   used for educational and recreational purposes. Nature reserves need to
   be managed in order to maintain the existing fauna and flora.}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{127-136}},

Abstract = {{Aerosol measurement frequently requires that an aerosol sample be
   withdrawn from its environment. The sampled mass is not strictly
   proportional to the sampled volume because mass is present in discrete
   entities. This introduces a fundamental variability in the estimated
   particle mass concentration, particularly important for small particle
   samples. The total amount of any particle measure, w, including mass, of
   the sampled particles is described by its coefficient of variation, CV.
   The results also apply for sampling a volume of liquid in which
   particles are dispersed, and can under some conditions be used for, e.g.
   analysis of weight per cent of asbestos in bulk powder, and
   microscopical analysis of total particle mass or projected area in a
   specimen. The fundamental coefficient of variation CV is also given for
   the special case of individual particle diameters having a log-normal
   distribution. Exact knowledge of the size distribution at the upper tail
   is critical in determining CV, as illustrated by calculating CV for a
   range of right truncated log-normal distributions. A mass variability
   equivalent diameter, MVED, is defined, by which the mass variability of
   a polydisperse aerosol can be described,in terms of number variability
   (Poisson) of a monodisperse aerosol with diameter MVED. A population of
   airborne particles, sized by microscopy is used to show that in order to
   obtain CV<10\% for particle mass, a sample of this particular aerosol
   must contain an expected mass of 0.01 mg, and an expected number of
   particles, N>6500, while only 100 particles would be needed if the
   measure was particle number. The variability is termed fundamental
   because it is the lowest achievable variability for given sample size
   and size distribution. This must be recognized, when determining overall
   uncertainty budgets for analytical procedures, including use of direct
   reading particle mass monitors for which a simple equation is given for
   calculating CV.}},

   high frequencies of continued European markers in the feral population
   of honey bees from the Yucatan could be explained by the population size

Abstract = {{Plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), enroute from hibernating
   sites in the woods were first recovered from plum trees at 95\% full
   bloom. First mating occurred as early as 95\% full bloom and no later
   than 90\% petal fall. Most matings occurred during April when the adult
   population was highest. Fruit injury (feeding and oviposition) was
   greater on plum than on peach or other Prunus species. Little feeding
   and/or oviposition was recorded on fruit of Prunus japonica Thunb. in
   field nursery plots. However, when P. japonica fruit was picked, brought
   into the laboratory, put in cups with laboratory-reared plum curculio,
   the weevils fed and oviposited as well as on other Prunus species fruit.
   First field brood emergence was detected when most collected adult
   females (16 of 18) were virgin during 26 May - 1 June 1991. The 7-day
   period was indicative of a new generation because newly-emerged females
   were sexually immature for approximately 7 days. Prior to and after that
   7-day emergence period, most females were mated. Various monitoring
   methods were evaluated which included green sticky balls, pitfall traps,
   sticky trunk bands, boil weevil traps, and tree jarring. Tree jarring
   was the best method for monitoring plum curculio.}},

Abstract = {{The levels of organochlorine (OC) contaminants in eggs and tissues of
   waterbird species nesting in Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, an International
   Joint Commission Area of Concern, were monitored between 1981 and 1992.
   PCBs, DDE, and mirex were present at the highest concentrations of the
   29 organochlorines and one trace metal measured. Most contaminants in
   the various species tested showed a declining temporal pattern during
   that period. Double-crested cormorant eggs generally had higher
   concentrations of contaminants than those in herring gull eggs which in
   turn were higher than those in eggs of black-crowned night-herons,
   Caspian terns and common terns. The levels of contaminants in the eggs
   reflect the dietary preferences of the species with the fish-eating
   birds containing consistently higher accumulations of contaminants when
   compared to the herbivorous Canada goose for which the levels were
   consistently much lower for all compounds. The concentrations of
   contaminants detected are among some of the highest in the Great Lakes
   but when compared to other sites on Lake Ontario, the levels in Hamilton
   Harbour are generally equal or lower. Elevated levels of contaminants
   such as PCBs, mirex, and DDE were also detected in liver and muscle
   tissues of migrant waterfowl species from the harbor. Despite habitat
   degradation and continued presence of contaminants, the harbor supports
   a large number and wide variety of waterbird species. Except for
   black-crowned night herons, the nesting populations of colonial
   waterbirds have increased between 21 and 1061 \% since the East survey
   in 1987.}},

Abstract = {{The white sucker, Catostomus commersoni (Lacapede), has been proposed as
   a sentinel species to monitor environmental health in the Great Lakes.
   In a population of white suckers spawning in the Ganaraska River, Lake
   Ontario (Port Hope, Ontario) there was an elevated prevalence of lip
   papillomas (46\%), body papillomas (1.4\%), and mucoid plaques (47\%)
   compared to an inland reference population from the Squaw River, Little
   Bald Lake, Ontario (5\%, 0\%, and 0.5\%, respectively). Multiple lip
   papillomas, and papillomas in apposition were prevalent in Ganaraska
   River suckers (17\%) but rare in Squaw River suckers (1.2\%). The
   prevalence of lip papillomas was not related to age or size, but
   papillomas at the Ganaraska site were up to 10 times larger than
   papillomas at the Squaw site. Relative papilloma prevalences at the two
   sites were correlated with relative concentrations of persistent
   contaminants (PCBs and OC compounds) in fish tissue. Histologically, lip
   and body papillomas were classified as benign hyperplasia and could be
   differentiated from normal tissue and mucoid plaques on the basis of
   biochemical (Protein Kinase C) activity. In laboratory experiments,
   mucoid plaques disappeared completely within 96 hours of antibiotic
   treatments (100\% of treated suckers vs. 15\% of untreated centrals) and
   re-infection was not observed. These experiments indicate that mucoid
   plaques are not true neoplasms.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess resistance to common bean blight, populations of two
   isolates of Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli were monitored in leaves
   of two Phaseolus vulgar is breeding lines, BLT87-2 (susceptible) and
   OAC88-1 (partially resistant) and a resistant tepary bean accession, P.
   acutifolius P. I. 440795. The breeding line OAC88-1 possesses resistance
   to common bacterial blight which was incorporated from P. acutifolius by
   an interspecific cross. In susceptible leaves, bacterial populations
   increased to 10(8) CFU/g leaf at 3 wk after inoculation whereas, in
   resistant leaves, bacterial populations declined to 10(1) - 10(3) CFU/g
   leaf. In partially resistant leaves the population first declined
   similar to that in resistant P. acutifolius but later increased, and
   typical bacterial blight symptoms appeared. Cellulase, protease and
   amylase activities were monitored in culture and intercellular leaf
   spaces. Only cellulase activity was clearly related to bacterial growth
   in the susceptible host; other enzyme activities were variable in their
   relationship to host resistance and bacterial growth. Differences

Abstract = {{Recurrent monitoring of water wells is necessary to ensure that
   nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in groundwater do not exceed 10
   mg/L, the maximum contaminant level set by the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency. Continuous chemical analysis is often a time
   consuming and expensive process. A recently developed `Reflectoquant
   Analysis System', which employs reflectometry techniques, may offer a
   simple and accurate method for NO3-N analysis. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate the `Reflectoquant Analysis System' as an
   alternative method for determination of NO3-N in well water. Water
   samples were collected from 42 wells in Oklahoma. The samples were
   analyzed using the `Reflectoquant Analysis System', automated cadmium
   reduction (Griess-Ilosvay), ion chromatography, and phenoldisulfonic
   acid procedures. The linear range of the `Reflectoquant Analysis System'
   is 1.1 to 50.6 mg/L NO3-N. Samples exceeding this range must be diluted
   before analysis is performed. Excluding two wells where NO3-N was >50.6
   mg/L, simple correlation was high (r > 0.91) among the four procedures
   evaluated. In addition, slopes and intercepts from linear regression of
   NO3-N among procedures were not significantly different. Population
   means obtained using the four methods were very similar. For this sample
   of wells, the `Reflectoquant Analysis System' was precise and provided
   NO3-N analysis of water samples equivalent to standard methods. Other
   advantages of the `Reflectoquant Analysis System' are short analytical
   times, reduced operator training period, and competitive costs compared
   to standard methods.}},

Abstract = {{Three long-term studies of lichen growth and colonization have been
   undertaken at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, in the maritime
   Antarctic. Small individual thalli of several crustose species and
   uncolonized plots on 12 fresh rock surfaces were photographically
   monitored at intervals of 3-4 years over a period of up to 20 years. The
   development of Ochrolechia frigida colonies on a regenerating moss bank,
   recently uncovered by a receding glacier, was similarly monitored. The
   results indicate that many lichens growing in sites enriched by
   nitrogenous compounds derived from populations of sea birds, have
   relatively rapid colonization and growth rates. Mean percentage increase
   in thallus area can be as high as 15-32\% per annum in some nitrophilous
   saxicolous species (e.g. Acarospora macrocyclos, Xanthoria elegans and
   species of Buellia and Caloplaca), but as low as 0.4-4\% in nitrophobous
   species (Lecanora physciella, Lecidea sp., Rhizocarpon geographicum).
   Umbilicaria antarctica and Usnea antarctica also yielded data indicating
   high growth rates, with colonist plants reaching several centimetres
   after 20 years. Colonization by mixed assemblages of lichens of new rock
   surfaces can attain 40-->90\% cover after 20 years in nutrient-enriched
   sites, and even 20-25\% in non-biotically influenced sites. Colonization
   by or increase in extant O. frigida on the regenerating moribund moss
   bank was also quite rapid. It is suggested that the exceptionally large
   thalli of several lichen species and the locally extensive dense lichen
   fellfield communities in the maritime Antarctic may be much younger than
   previously supposed. (C) 1995 The British Lichen Society}},

Abstract = {{A series of incubation experiments were made to measure the rate of
   release of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) by the jellyfish Aurelia
   aurita (L.) (collected in 1991-1992 in Gullmarsfjorden, Sweden). Release
   of DOC by medusae (9.5 to 18 cm in diameter) from the Skagerrak ranged
   from 0.70 to 1.6 mg C ind(-1) d(-1) with a mean of 1.2 mg C ind(-1)
   d(-1) (SD=0.29 mg C ind(-1) d(-1), n=10). Based on data from the
   literature for two medusa populations, this can be equivalent to 2.5 and
   7.1\% of the carbon assimilated in one season (June to September).;This
   was similar to the amount of carbon allocated to reproduction. Bacterial
   abundance was monitored to evaluate the possible stimulating effect of
   the DOC released. Bacterial growth was stimulated by the presence of A.
   aurita. The importance of A. aurita as a source of DOC on a large scale
   is small compared to exudate from primary producers. The volume
   surrounding each medusa, wherein the DOC released may be enough to
   sustain a bacterial production such as the one reported from the Swedish
   west coast, is equivalent to a sphere with a diameter of 0.5 m. Thus,
   considering the patchy distribution of medusae, the local influence of
   their DOC release could be important.}},

Abstract = {{Specimens of the common limpet (Patella vulgata) were collected from

   their minor element (Mg, Sr) and trace element (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn) content.
   Mean concentrations (n = 75) of these elements in the shell of P.
   Vulgata were 3621, 1566, 15.6, 46.1, 2.7 and 3.9 mu g g(-1),
   respectively. The elemental concentrations, however, exhibited both a
   marked intra-and inter-population variability. Principal component
   analysis applied to the data for individual populations showed the
   element concentrations in the shell to be controlled by three
   contemporaneous, but quite different agencies. Despite the variability
   within individual populations, significant differences in gross element
   composition were apparent amongst the three populations studied. The
   environmental availability of elements at the three sites was not
   reflected in the trace metal concentrations of the shells. The shell of
   P. Vulgata is therefore rejected for potential use in environmental
   trace metal monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Boat-based surveys have been commonly used to monitor sea otter
   populations, but there has been little quantitative work to evaluate
   detection biases that may affect these surveys. We used ground-based
   observers to investigate sea otter detection probabilities in a
   boat-based survey of Prince William Sound, Alaska. We estimated that
   30\% of the otters present on surveyed transects were not detected by
   boat crews. Approximately half (53\%) of the undetected otters were
   missed because the otters left the transects, apparently in response to
   the approaching boat. Unbiased estimates of detection probabilities will
   be required for obtaining unbiased population estimates from boat-based
   surveys of sea otters. Therefore, boat-based surveys should include
   methods to estimate sea otter detection probabilities under the
   conditions specific to each survey. Unbiased estimation of detection
   probabilities with ground-based observers requires either that the
   ground crews detect all of the otters in observed subunits, or that
   there are no errors in determining which crews saw each detected otter.
   Ground-based observer methods may be appropriate in areas where nearly
   all of the sea otter habitat is potentially visible from ground-based
   vantage points.}},

Abstract = {{There is substantial evidence that tributyltin (TBT) contamination has
   decreased following the introduction of legislation prohibiting the use
   of TBT-based paints on vessels less than 25 m in length. Ambient levels
   of TBT have decreased in the water column, sediments and tissues of
   molluscs, and there has been recovery of dogwhelks and oysters from
   imposex and shell deformation, respectively. Severe pollution is now
   restricted primarily to hotspots of boating activity, such as ports.
   There is no evidence that it is a major problem in open seas and oceanic
   waters. There are now indications that imposex is less specific than has
   been supposed. While the response will still be useful in monitoring
   recovery of populations of Nucella lapillus from the effects of TBT
   pollution, its general use as a bioindicator of TBT is questionable.}},

Abstract = {{The orientation of adults of the myiasis species Wohlfahrtia magnifica
   and Lucilia sericata to artificial visual stimuli (cloth targets) and
   olfactory stimuli ('swormlure-4', a potent screwworm attractant), was
   studied in sheep pastures near to Sarbogard in Hungary. Experiments with
   odour-baited cloth targets, enclosed in electrocuting grids,
   demonstrated that colour was an important factor influencing catches on
   targets: a black target caught most flies of both species, with other
   colours in the following order of effectiveness, blue > white > yellow.
   Wohlfahrtia magnifica did not respond to swormlure-4 in the strong
   manner that L.sericata did. The sex ratios of W.magnifica caught on
   targets (67.2\% males) and hand-netted from fence posts (68.8\% males)
   were similar and biased towards males, whereas that of L.sericata on
   targets was strongly biased towards females (15.6\% males), indicating a
   fundamental difference in the response of these two myiasis species
   towards the swormlure-baited targets. The orientation of these two
   species towards hosts was also recorded together with that of a third
   species, Phormia regina. Electric nets placed beside infested sheep
   caught significantly more flies of all three species than those placed
   beside uninfested sheep or in the absence of sheep. The sex ratio of W.
   magnifica caught around infested sheep was the reverse of that on
   targets, with 68.5\% females. Wohlfahrtia magnifica responded more
   strongly to healthy, uninfested sheep than did L.sericata and P.regina.
   The potential for use of targets both for population monitoring and
   control is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal ecosystems, including those with natural areas (e.g., reserves,
   refuges, parks) receive virtually all of the water flowing off the
   continental United States. As the human population increases, so do
   waste loads and use of the terrestrial surface. Changes in land use
   result in changes in land cover, which affect water quality and,
   subsequently, coastal and estuarine habitats, and their living
   resources. Lack of understanding of the cumulative effects of land cover
   and changes in land cover on these habitats and their resources has
   limited the appropriate management of landscape activities.
   Additionally, in the United States, as elsewhere, human population in
   the coastal region is increasing at an ever-quickening pace. Our ability
   to monitor resultant land cover and habitat change has not kept pace
   with the change, and management, thus, has been more reactive than
   proactive. Remote sensing is a key element of monitoring land cover
   changes over broad areas of the coastal zone in a synoptic, relatively
   inexpensive, and dependable way. Such information, when assimilated into
   a geographical information system and integrated with transport and
   process-oriented models, would allow us to relate land cover and changes
   in land cover(i.e., development in the coastal zone) to effects on
   living marine resources; it also would permit proactive responses to
   continuing degradation and loss of coastal and estuarine habitats and
   their living marine resources.}},

Abstract = {{Australian isolates of nematode-trapping fungi were screened for
   activity against nematodes on agar and in soil. Ail isolates produced
   traps extensively on agar in response to Caenorhabditis elegans and,
   within 1-3 days, populations of this nematode were generally reduced by
   at least 90\%. Juveniles of Meloidogyne javanica induced fewer traps on
   agar and most fungi took more than 3 days to reduce numbers of nematodes
   by more than 90\%. Experiments in microcosms showed that predacious
   activity on agar gave little indication of the capacity of a fungus to
   trap nematodes when added to mineral soil. Species such as Dactylella
   candida and Arthrobotrys dactyloides, which formed detachable rings and
   knobs or constricting rings, consistently reduced the number of M.
   javanica juveniles recovered from soil whereas network-forming species
   sometimes did not. In studies using agar `sandwich' and buried slide
   techniques to monitor trapping activity in soil, D. candida and A.
   dactyloides consistently produced traps within 5 days of being
   introduced, whereas network-forming species produced few traps in soil
   and their trapping activity varied from experiment to experiment.}},

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{123-130}},
Abstract = {{Percentage non-toxic bait interference is currently used by local
   authorities to monitor brushtail possum control operations but the
   validity of the method has not been established. Two models have been
   proposed to estimate an index of possum density (possums per bait) from
   a log-transformation of percentage bait interference. In two trials,
   percentage bait interference and the density index derived from
   percentage bait interference using the Bamford (1970) model usually
   increased from night to night. Variation in the number of possums per
   bait was reduced by dividing the Bamford index by the number of nights
   baits were put out, as proposed by Jane (1981). The spatial distribution
   of bait interference along lines of bait stations was random for the
   first night and usually for at least 5 nights. Rhodomine dye and cyanide
   poison, alternated at bait stations after at least 5 nights non-toxic
   baiting, showed that about 83\% of possums in one trial and 29\% of
   possums in the other trial interfered with more than one bait on the
   same night. Increasing the spacing between bait stations reduced the
   proportion of possums interfering with more than one bait. The number of
   possums per line killed by cyanide baits after at least 5 nights of
   non-toxic baiting was strongly correlated with percentage bait
   interference, with and without logarithmic transformation, on the first
   night. The possums' apparent ability to remember the location of bait
   stations from one night to the next means that, in the absence of better
   advice, the original Bamford (1970) model should be modified as proposed
   by Jane (1981) to estimate possum density and change in possum density
   (e.g., from pre- to post-poison).}},

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{The population trends of the Finnish Dotterel were studied for the past
   150 years. A comprehensive study of Finnish ornithological literature
   was undertaken, the main bird archives were worked through and
   additional data were gathered through personal correspondence. Thus an
   almost complete coverage of the published observations was obtained,
   augmented by many previously unpublished records. The number of
   observations was fairly stable up to the mid-twentieth century, the
   slight apparent increase being mostly due to an increase in the numbers
   of bird-watchers. In reality the numbers probably decreased. The peak
   abundance was most likely in the 1880s. The main reason for the
   subsequent decline was obviously overhunting. In the 1950s the Dotterel
   was still fairly numerous; a decrease probably started sometimes during
   the 1950s-1960s, although little published information is available. At
   the main Finnish study area (Varriotunturi fells) the number of breeding
   pairs has dropped dramatically since the early 1970s. The main reason
   for the recent decline is probably the use of pesticides in the
   wintering area. During the Finnish ornithological history the number of
   Dotterel have decreased to 1-10\% of the original, perhaps even more. As
   no exact data were available for the Dotterel it was not included in the
   `'Red Data Book'' of Finland. The data presented in this report suggests
   that it would belong at least to the category `'in need of monitoring''.
   The Dotterel is Listed in the EC Directive on the Conservation of Wild
   Birds (Directive 79/409/EEC).}},

Abstract = {{A model composed of two straight lines describes the relation between
   overwintering spring adults of Colorado potato beetle {[}Leptinotarsa

   (L.), cv. `Superior') had a damage boundary of around 5.8 spring adults
   per plant.  However, under conditions favorable for reproduction,
   overwintering adults of 0.07 beetles per plant would produce a large
   population of first-generation larvae that would reduce considerably the
   potato yield if not controlled.  There is no appreciable seasonal
   overlapping between adults and young larvae in the field.  Monitoring
   activities should therefore be directed at the beginning of the season
   against overwintering adults and later against first-generation larvae. 
   For summer adults, an action threshold of 10 per plant is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Control of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera:
   Tortricidae), by pheromone-mediated mating disruption, was studied in
   Israel using two types of dispensers: Shin-Etsu twist-tie (normal and
   long-life) and TNO matrix formulation (square wafers). Factors affecting
   mating disruption: initial pest population density, timing of the
   pheromone application, early season insecticide treatments and
   monitoring of the pest, were evaluated. Efficacy of mating disruption
   was assessed by comparing catch of males in pheromone traps located in
   pheromone-treated and chemically sprayed control plots. Fruit
   infestation during the season and at picking time was the major
   criterion to assess mating disruption. The preferred time for pheromone
   application was before the first flight of the moth. When pheromones
   were applied at a later stage, one or two early insecticide sprays had
   to be used to reduce the initial level of the codling moth population.
   In all tests, trap catch in pheromone-treated plots was drastically
   reduced as compared with respective control plots. In pheromone-treated
   plots where total seasonal trap catch (after pheromone application) was
   less than 12 males/trap, fruit infestation was less than 1.5\%; zero
   trap catch resulted in 0.1-0.3\% infestation. At high population levels,
   mating disruption was ineffective, with the rate of infestation at
   picking-time being similar in pheromone-treated and control plots. All
   the field tests indicated that mating disruption with either Shin-Etsu
   ropes or TNO squares can control codling moth infestations in apple and
   pear orchards, at relatively low densities of the pest, as efficiently
   as commercial insecticide sprays.}},

Abstract = {{Pythium nunn parasitized the hyphae, sporangia, chlamydospores, and
   sexual organs of five isolates of P. cinnamomi, P. citrophthora, and P.
   parasitica in vitro, and caused inhibition of mycelial growth of these
   isolates. Population densities of P. nunn in a peat/sand mix, monitored
   up to 8 wk, declined gradually unless 1\% ground rolled oats were added
   to the mix at 2 wk. Population densities of all three Phytophthora spp.
   also increased after 1\% ground rolled oats were added. Population
   densities of P. cinnamomi, P. citrophthora, and one isolate of P.
   parasitica in oat-amended treatments were reduced in the presence of P.
   nunn, but no reduction in population densities of the other isolate of
   P. parasitica occurred in the presence of P. nunn, with or without oats.
   The effectiveness of P. nunn in suppressing root rot of azalea
   (Rhododendron spp.) caused by P. cinnamomi or P. parasitica, and root
   rot of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) caused by P. parasitica, was
   evaluated in the peat/sand mix amended with 1\% ground rolled oats in
   greenhouse tests. P. nunn at 300 propagules per gram did not suppress
   azalea or sweet orange root rot. At 1,000 propagules per gram, it
   significantly suppressed sweet orange root rot caused by P. parasitica.
   P. nunn did not affect the growth of azalea but slightly reduced sweet
   orange seedling growth.}},

Abstract = {{Birth rate and immature survival rate in group living primates have been
   predicted to vary as a function of group size. These predictions were
   tested with data from a wild population of lion-tailed macaques in the
   Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu (India). Group size and
   composition, births, and mortality were monitored from eight groups for
   one to six years. The rate of growth of groups, birth rate, and survival
   rate were examined in relation to group size. The rate of growth of a
   group was a decreasing function of group size. Birth rate was also a
   decreasing function of group size and the number of adult females in the
   group. The sample size for survival rate of adults was too small to test
   for their dependence on group size. Immature survival was independent of
   group size, but the analysis was based on a very small sample. It is
   possible that the nature of dependence of net growth rate, birth rate,
   and survival rate on group size could be different outside the range of
   group sizes on which the analysis was based. The stronger relationship
   between birth rate and group size in the lion-tailed macaque, in
   relation to other primates, might be the result of its low birth rate as
   well as the relatively low temporal variation in resources in the rain
   forest. Limited data available from other sites indicate that the
   observed relationship between birth rate and group size might be
   spatially stable.}},

Abstract = {{New Jersey experienced a fairly wet spring in 1994, but Culiseta
   melanura populations remained well below average during the months of
   May, June and July. By mid-August, there was a rising trend in the
   numbers of mosquitoes utilizing the resting boxes, and by September, Cs.
   melanura populations were above normal at most of the sites that were
   being monitored for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). PCR
   testing indicated that EEEV was present at some of the sites in late
   June, but the results were not confirmed by the parallel virus isolation
   attempts that were being conducted on the specimens. In early August,
   both test systems detected virus in mosquitoes, and equine cases
   followed the isolations in September and October. A total of 7 equine
   cases of EEEV were reported from New Jersey during 1994. In addition,
   EEEV was responsible for mortality in flocks of emu in Atlantic and
   Gloucester counties where the exotic birds were being raised for
   commercial purposes. PCR tests indicated that virus was being amplified
   in Burlington Co. before the first equine case of the season and in
   Atlantic Co. before the epizootic that took place in emus. This suggests
   that PCR may prove to be an indicator of low level virus activity and
   have value as an early warning system for mosquito control.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of a distinct walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) population in
   south-flowing drainages of the southeastern United States has been
   suspected for some time. Recently, a mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) marker
   was identified that permitted discrimination of these southern walleyes
   from northern forms. In order to determine the type and distribution of
   walleyes in Alabama, mtDNA analysis was conducted on 35 individuals
   collected from 3 river systems within the state. Thirty-one fish
   collected in the Mobile Basin were the southern form of walleye, which
   previously had been identified only in northeastern Mississippi, while 4
   fish from the Tennessee River were of the northern form. There was no
   evidence for the successful establishment of any female walleyes from
   Ohio that were stocked into 2 impoundments in the Mobile Basin 10-20
   years ago. Additional surveys and a careful monitoring program using
   genetic markers should be implemented to detect any infusion of northern
   walleyes into the Mobile Basin through the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway.}},

Abstract = {{Information on winter movements and denning of Florida black bears
   (Ursus americanus floridanus) is important to develop habitat management
   programs. I studied denning characteristics and winter movements of 13
   radiocollared bears (9M, 4F) in the Apalachicola National Forest and
   surrounding timberlands of northwest Florida from 1990-91 to 1992-93.
   All monitored bears denned during the study Pregnant females entered
   dens earlier (P < 0.02), emerged later (P < 0.02), and denned longer
   (142 +/- 5 {[}SE] vs. 52 +/- 7 days) than other bears. Denning periods
   for pregnant females were similar to those reported from other
   Southeastern black bear populations. Males denned far short periods ((x)
   over bar = 51 +/- 8 days, N = 8). One male bear, which denned during
   winter 1991-92, remained active during winter 1992-93, using a range of
   37 km(2). All males, even when they denned, ranged widely during winter
   ((x) over bar = 18 +/- 7 km(2)). Short denning periods and extensive
   winter movements are likely related to food availability mild climate,
   and possibly habitat quality.}},

Abstract = {{A population of eastern wild turkeys (Melagris gallopavo silvestris) was
   studied in the lower coastal plain of South Carolina to determine if
   intensively managed short-rotation pine plantations have a detrimental
   effect on reproductive success. Reproductive parameters including
   nesting chronology, nest success, hen success, clutch size, and
   hatchability were estimated from 50 radio-instrumented hens monitored
   during 1988-1990. Predation during nesting and brooding periods was the
   major cause of nest and adult hen losses (55\%). However, illegal kills
   were as high (45\%). Median dates for incubation initiation and hatching
   were 8 May and 3 June, respectively. Nest success (\% hatched greater
   than or equal to 1 egg) was 57.9\%. Proportion of hens in the population
   expected to produce poults was 50\%. Clutches averaged 9.8 eggs with
   82\% hatchability. Number of poults produced/hen averaged 4.0. Nest
   sites were located in all stand types in proportion to their
   availability. Stand age or basal area did not affect nest site
   selection. Most nests (61\%) occurred in stands controlled burned within
   2 years and 62\% of nests were located within 30 m of a road, trail or
   firebreak. Reproductive parameters were similar to values reported in
   other studies and did not indicate a negative effect from intensive
   forest management practices.}},

Abstract = {{To determine effects of land use and management practices on wild turkey
   (Meleagris gallapovo) populations, managers need reliable, low-cost
   methods to estimate absolute and relative densities. Therefore, we
   evaluated estimation ability of 4 models using wild turkey capture data
   from 1986-1993 and summer bait site observations from 1990-1993 in
   Kemper County, Mississippi. Capture-mark-recapture models performed
   worse (i.e., higher coefficients of variance) than capture-mark-resight
   models. Estimates from 1 resighting model were biased from
   non-homogenous capture probabilities in most intervals (4 of 6) for both
   sexes. Estimates from a second resighting model required restriction of
   marked population to active radio-equipped hens. This model performed
   well in 1990 and 1991, but likely overestimated population size in 1992
   and 1993 when marked/sighted samples were only 9 and 4 individuals. A
   3-stage resighting-based sampling design was suggested for turkey
   census. Minimum counts of individuals, from concomitant bait site
   monitoring, agreed with estimates for hens, but were less consistent for
   gobblers. More precise estimates for longer periods are required to
   adequately assess reliability of minimum counts as population indices.
   Density estimates of hens were between 0.95 and 3.21 hens/km(2) and were
   generally higher than those from more `'traditional'' habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Northern bobwhite (Calinus virginianus) populations have declined on a
   continental scale. One factor implicated in the decline is habitat loss
   through agricultural modernization. To better understand the
   relationship between northern bobwhite and modern farming, and to
   examine farm habitat improvement methods, we monitored bobwhite (N =
   218) from April to September 1993 and 1994 on two study areas, western
   (WSA) and eastern (ESA), each divided into one filter strip (FS)
   (treatment) and one non-filter strip (NFS) (reference) section on
   Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge's farming units in Dare County,
   North Carolina. Filter strips were 9.4 m wide planted and natural
   vegetation buffer zones surrounding drainage-ditches in crop fields.
   Using radio-telemetry, we followed bobwhite, identified nest incubations
   and hatchings, and monitored hatched broods. We examined the null
   hypotheses that number of captures, distances to first nest from capture
   site, number of nest incubation initiations, nest success, and adult and
   brood survival would be identical on FS and NFS sections. With equal
   effort, there were 142 and 65 bobwhite captured on the WSA FS and NFS
   sections, and 75 and 48 bobwhite captured on the ESA FS and NFS
   sections, respectively. Pooling data across areas, sections, and years,
   42 quail initiated 53 clutches. There were 31 and 3 incubations
   initiated on the WSA FS and NFS sections, respectively. There were 13
   and 6 incubations initiated on the ESA FS and NFS sections,
   respectively. Pooling across areas, sections, and years there was 1
   incubation/3 and 1 incubation/8 transmittered bobwhite on FS and NFS
   sections, respectively. Pooling clutch (N = 28) data for all areas,
   sections, and years, clutches averaged 11.7 (SE = 0.75), and declined
   over time (P = 0.006). Nest success, pooled across years for section,
   was 32\% (N = 44, 14 successful) and 44\% (n = 9, 4 successful) for FS
   and NFS sections, respectively, and did not differ (P > 0.05). Pooling
   across sections by year, nesting success did not differ between years (P
   = 0.11), but differed between early (less than or equal to 15 Jul) and
   late (> 15 Jul) periods (19.4\% and 54.5\%, respectively, P = 0.02).
   Quail on NFS areas exhibited greater movements from capture site to
   first nest. Pooling survival data across areas, sections, and years
   sub-adult/adult survival from 1 April to 29 September was 33\% (95\% CI
   = 24\% - 42\%). Brood survival to 28 days (N = 5) ranged from 0\%-100\%
   and averaged 68\% (SE = 17\%). Higher nesting success and high brood
   survival in the later periods were correlated with maturation of
   broadcast-planted soybeans.}},

   State Park (BBRSP) 22 January 1993 through 9 March 1995, using trained
   hounds or leg-hold snares. All captured lions were examined, aged and
   sexed, and a series of body measurements were recorded. Two lions-1
   adult female and 1 subadult male-died during capture. A subadult male
   orphaned as a kitten and sent to a wildlife rehabilitor was returned to
   the study area, but was later killed off the study area. Fifteen lions-5
   adult females, 1 subadult female, 7 adult males and 2 subadult
   males-were fitted with radio transmitters. Three of the collared lions-1
   adult female and 2 adult males-were killed north of the study area.
   Collared lions were monitored from the ground and fixed-wing aircraft.
   We recorded 506 locations and delineated home ranges for 10 collared
   lions. Home ranges of males varied from 316-597 km(2), while those for
   females ranged from 167 to 505 km(2). Fecal analysis indicated collared
   peccary (Tayassu tajacu), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and

Abstract = {{Field studies were conducted during three years to determine the
   vertical (height level) and horizontal (distance from stand edge)
   distribution of flying Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffroy) males in a
   non-outbreak population. Sticky traps baited with synthetic female
   pheromone (2S, 3S, 7S-diprionyl acetate) were used in a mature stand of
   Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Central Europe (southern Bohemia).
   The vertical distribution was distinct; more males were caught in traps
   at 9.0-12.5 m height (crown stratum) than in traps at 2.5 or 0.5 m above
   ground. The horizontal distribution was rather uniform inside the stand,
   with only small differences between catches near the stand edge ( < 30
   m) and inside the forest. These data show that the main flight of N.
   sertifer males in high pine stands takes place at the crown level.
   Implications for the use of pheromone traps in monitoring programs are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The South Atlantic population of albacore is assessed by means of an
   (observation-error) age-structured production model. Relative abundance
   (cpue) series up to 1993 from the Republic of China, Japan and South
   Africa are used in the model-fitting process. Coefficients of variation
   and confidence intervals for the estimates are obtained using the
   (conditioned) parametric bootstrap and the percentile methods
   respectively. The sensitivity of the results to violation of some of the
   assumptions made by the model, changes to the values of its input
   parameters, and changes to the abundance series used in the
   model-fitting process are examined. The results of the age-structured
   production model are contrasted with those of an age-aggregated
   observation-error estimator and those of a Bayesian estimator which
   allows also for fluctuations in recruitment. The resource was estimated
   to be markedly depleted - to probably slightly above 20\% of its
   pre-exploitation level expressed in terms of exploitable biomass - and
   to have an annual maximum sustainable yield of slightly less than 25 000
   tons. Qualitatively, the results are insensitive to the changes
   examined. Risk analyses are carried out for a variety of future
   harvesting strategies. These suggest that recent average annual catches
   of almost 29 000 tons need to be reduced to below 25 000 tons to prevent
   continued depletion of the resource. It appears that there would be
   almost no benefit from the introduction of a minimum size in the
   fishery. Careful monitoring of the situation is required to allow
   refinement of these estimates with time, and to check the effectiveness
   of any management action taken.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term health of shrimp aquaculture can befacilitated by basing
   the industry on a Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) model. Under an SPF
   model, the shrimp culture industry is composed of three streams, the SPF
   stream, the HHS (High Health Status) stream, and the Commodity
   Production (CP) stream. The SPF stream consists of Nucleus Breeding
   Centers (NBCs) and associated activities, the HHS stream is comprised of
   operations that produce seed for commodity shrimp growout, and the CP
   stream is the growout component of the industry. The significance of a
   pathogen to the industry depends upon the stream under consideration,
   the pathogenicity of the agent, the diagnosability of the agent, and
   excludability of the agent. Such considerations allow pathogens to be
   placed into three tiers for purposes of surveillance. Tier 3 pathogens
   are a threat to all three industry streams and they pose a threat to the
   survival of the whole industry. Tier 2 includes all Tier 3 pathogens
   plus those that pose a somewhat lesser threat to the CP stream but may
   have great impact on the SPF and HHS streams. Tier 1 pathogens include
   all Tier 3 and 2 pathogens and additional pathogens that have a minimal
   recognized impact but nonetheless should be excluded from NBCs. The
   pathogen status of the SPF stream is assured by intensive surveillance
   of NBCs for Tier 1 pathogens combined with strict founder population
   development protocols, Founder populations are generated by an extensive
   quarantine protocol that results in an SPF Fl generation derived from
   wild parents;In contrast to the SPF stream, the HHS stream consists of a
   large number of individual operations and facilities. In the HHS stream
   there are three production stations: HHS broodstock multiplication
   stations, HHS maturation stations, and HHS larval rearing stations. The
   resulting larger flow of animals can only be accommodated through a
   combination of less intensive monitoring and restricting surveillance in
   the HHS stream to only those pathogens that have a significant economic
   impact and also can be detected easily and reliably (Tier 2 pathogens).
   The CP stream is even larger than the NHS stream and intensive
   monitoring is too formidable to implement systematically. Only the most
   dangerous pathogens are included as Tier 3 pathogens. The CP stream's
   only assurance is through farmers' knowledge of Tier 3 pathogens and a
   recognition of their responsibility to notify the appropriate
   authorities in the event of a possible Tier 3 contamination.}},

Abstract = {{With recent global increases in shrimp disease problems affecting the
   industry, it is vital to implement pond management practices that
   minimize potential causes of diseases and water quality problems. Pond
   management is intricate and complex and requires an understanding of
   several factors, including biology of the targeted species, bottom and
   water quality, and continuous feedback from ponds in production. Feed
   management is a major component of pond management and critical for
   adequate production and feed conversion rates. Incorrect feed management
   can lead to diseases and water quality-related problems which adversely
   affect production. This review briefly describes general feed management
   Strategies practiced worldwide in semi-intensive sand intensive shrimp
   culture, including management of natural productivity, and management of
   commercial and farm made aquafeeds. Included are feed selection
   criteria, reception, handling and storage guidelines for feed,
   application methods and feeding regimes. An optimal feed management is
   that method which results in maximum growth and survival, and lowest
   feed conversion with minimum feed input and minimum environmental
   impact. Feed management involves the feeds to use, when, how much and
   how to feed, and how to evaluate and adjust management practices. Feed
   quality has been extensively reviewed by several authors and will not be
   past of this review. Deciding when to feed involves determining activity
   patterns, feeding frequency and feeding time. Uneaten feed accumulates
   on the bottom and adversely influences bottom and water quality.
   Calculating how much to feed involves estimating survival rates,
   population size, size distribution and biomass. Evaluating sand
   adjusting feed input involves population sampling, usually at weekly
   intervals, and also proper monitoring of various water parameters. Feed
   trays are fundamental to assess feed requirements, calculate and adjust
   daily rations, and avoid overfeeding. Correct feed management can
   significantly contribute to a healthy pond environment and consequently
   improve production.}},

Abstract = {{During the dry season each year (November through April), shrimp farms
   throughout Central America and the Caribbean coast of Colombia
   experience substantially reduced growth rates and yields. This slow
   growth has been widely attributed to the higher salinities and lower
   temperatures that typically prevail at this time of year. Recently,
   however, several investigators have questioned whether salinity and
   temperature are the primary causative factors. Some have suggested that
   a lack of natural productivity in the ponds during the dry season
   contributes to the problem, while others are considering the role of
   toxic algae blooms. Most farmers find that the seasonal slow growth is
   independent of the protein concentration or quality of the feed offered,
   but many farmers report that shrimp eat less during the dry season.
   This paper is intended as a review of published research on the problem
   and it also discusses the findings of several unpublished reports.
   Included are some of the results of a one year study conducted by the
   author on five shrimp farms in Guatemala. The farms are located on five
   different estuaries, all with slightly different environmental
   conditions, yet all farms experience a seasonal depression in growth and
   yield. It was reasoned that by comparing similarities and differences in
   environmental variables among farms, insights might he gained as to the
   cause of the slow-down.
   Despite near optimal salinities throughout the year on three of the five
   farms studied and near optimal temperatures on four of the five farms,
   all farms showed decreased growth rates and yields during the dry
   season. An analysis of the pond and supply water on the five farms
   showed variable nutrient levels between farms, but there appeared to be
   a trend toward increased total nitrogen in the supply water, as well as
   in production ponds, during the rainy season. While there was no
   apparent seasonal trend in phosphorous levels, the rainy season increase
   in nitrogen levels resulted in shrimp farms in Guatemala having
   generally higher N/P ratios during the rainy season, at a time when most
   farmers report higher levels of diatoms and lower levels of blue-green
   algae. Silica levels were not found to be limiting on any farm at any
   time of the year.
   No seasonal trend in average total bacterial counts in pond water was
   observed, nor was there any significant trend in populations of
   gram-positive spore-forming bacteria. However, there appeared to be a
   seasonal trend in the number of bacteria that grow on TCBS media
   (typically Vibrio sp.). During the dry season, a slight increase was
   observed in absolute numbers of TCBS bacteria and this trend became more
   obvious when TCBS bacteria were analyzed as a percentage of total
   bacteria. No such trend was observed in shrimp intestinal samples,
   however, and an attempt to correlate shrimp growth rates with levels of
   TCBS bacteria in pond water or shrimp intestine, showed no significant
   relationships.
   To test the possible effect of toxic algae on shrimp growth, a
   fractionization bioassay experiment was conducted during the 1994 dry
   season. Water from a production pond was passed through a series of
   canister filters to test the performance of 7 g shrimp grown for five
   weeks during the dry season in water with specific fractions of the
   water column sequentially removed, No significant differences in growth
   or survival were found in shrimp grown in the production pond as
   compared to bioassay treatments ranging from unfiltered pond water,
   through water that had been sequentially filtered to 10 mu m, and to 1
   mu M particle sizes, plus filtration through activated carbon. These
   results do not support the hypothesis that toxic algae or dissolved
   substances contribute to dry season production problems, at least at the
   farm, or in the pond from which the water used in this experiment was
   sourced.
   To test the hypothesis that shrimp eat less during the dry season, two
   commercial sized ponds were operated through a production cycle with all
   of the supplementary ration presented on feeding trays. Shrimp were fed
   four times each day, at 7 am, 4 pm, 8 pm and 4 am, and consumption on
   each tray was recorded at the next feeding. Based on observations of
   consumption, feeding times and rates were adjusted on a daily basis. The
   trial indicated that during the March through May 1994 period, shrimp
   consumed less feed during daylight hours than would be normally
   recommended from a feeding table. However, if feed was offered at night,
   daily consumption during the dry season was not depressed, with up to 80
   percent of the daily ration taken by the shrimp at night. When the rainy
   season started at the end of May 1994, feed consumption patterns
   changed, with at least half of the feed being consumed during the day.
   In addition, during the 1994 dry season, ponds fed at night had
   consistently Higher growth rates than other ponds that were fed an
   equivalent ration of feed, but at only two daylight feedings. These
   results suggest that without careful monitoring of feed consumption,
   seasonal changes in the feeding behavior of shrimp could contribute to
   the dry season production problems experienced in Central America and
   the Caribbean Basin.}},

Abstract = {{The evergreen dwarf shrub lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) was
   subjected to microtine herbivory simulations to investigate its recovery
   in a boreal forest. Beside the control (A), the study included three
   levels of herbivory: clipping of half the annual branches from 50\% of
   ramets (B), removal of 50\% of ramets (C), and removal of 100\% of
   ramets (D). Density, growth, and fecundity of the ramets were monitored
   during the study. New ramets emerged rapidly from dormant basal buds at
   the base of the removed ramets in groups C and D. After three growth
   seasons, 60-117\% and 42-112\% of density and biomass, respectively, had
   been regained in the groups damaged relative to the control, the
   difference being insignificant between the treated groups apparently
   because of the small sample size. Survival, fecundity and net growth of
   ramets were not affected by the treatment. Mean dry weight of annual
   branches in new ramets was lower in the damaged groups than the control.
   The recovery of the lingonberry was unexpectedly good. The results
   suggest that, since natural herbivory seldom is as heavy as in this
   work, the time between population density peaks of microtine rodents is
   usually long enough for the lingonberry to recover in boreal ecosystems.}},

   are dealt with: mercury, cadmium, copper and zinc, organohalogen
   compounds, organotins, organophosphorus compounds, herbicides and
   fungicides as well as synthetic persistent materials. The results have
   shown that pollution in the Mediterranean sea is limited to coastal
   areas where the sources, such as industries and population centres, are

Abstract = {{Large areas in Cairo have been experiencing groundwater and water table
   rise during the last decade. This has resulted in serious problems to
   the foundations of old houses, antiquities, and monuments. The main
   causes behind this rising water table and groundwater is the increased
   recharge from surface activities in a city experiencing increased
   population. Major sources of recharge in the urban area included leakage
   from water supply and sewerage pipes, while in the rural areas the major
   causes included domestic seepage from septic tanks and deep percolation
   of excess irrigation water in agricultural areas.
   Various studies have been conducted to investigate the possible remedial
   solutions. The most recent study conducted by the Research Institute for
   Groundwater indicated that the most effective remedial measure is
   through the reduction of recharge. This was determined through
   simulation of various remedial measures.
   In this paper, a preliminary assessment of the recently improved
   sewerage system is made. Results indicate considerable reduction in
   water table levels and groundwater heads in the region. Final assessment
   would require a thorough investigation of possible other changes in the
   environment including both quantitative and qualitative aspects. (C)

Abstract = {{The Citarum River in West Java has important role in the economic
   development and prosperity of the people in West Java Province and
   Jakarta City. It has been exploited to support agriculture, fisheries,
   public water supply, industry, hydroelectric power and recreation. More
   than 500 industries and about five million people in the basin are the
   main sources of water pollution of the Citarum River. The continuing
   deterioration of water quality in the Citarum River has become a routine
   water pollution case. Therefore it is necessary to solve the river
   pollution problems and upgrade the water quality. A study on water
   quality management of the Citarum River was executed from 1989 to 1993.
   The objective was to define the recommendation for the optimisation of
   water quality conservation. The results of the study show that the
   quality at most locations of the river during the dry season has
   exceeded the water quality objectives for its beneficial water uses. It
   is recomended that the domestic and industrial pollution load has to be
   reduced for water quality conservation. Smaller unit domestic waste
   treatment and centralised industrial waste treatment are recommended for
   pollution control. For further development it is recommended to
   propagate clean technology and to prefer giving licences to industries
   with tow water demand. Regular monitoring must be carried out for
   effective water quality control.}},

   established on the basis of epidemiological data of swimming-related

   in Hong Kong in 1992 involving interviewing 25000 beach-goers on the
   health effects of exposure to bathing water. The results indicated that
   the total incidence of swimming-related illness symptoms was 41 per
   1000, higher than the 30 per 1000 found in 1987. Eye, skin and
   respiratory symptoms were 2-20 times more prevalent in swimmers than in
   non-swimmers. Only gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were directly related
   to the pollution level and bacterial content of beach water. Turbidity
   of beach water was closely linked with GI and highly credible GI
   symptoms and might be used as a monitoring tool and a parameter in the
   beach water quality objective. There was also a direct correlation
   between GI symptoms and the number of Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonas
   spp., Vibrio cholerae (non-Ol) in beach water. No direct relationship

Abstract = {{The production of volatile odour compounds by freshwater phytoplankton
   was monitored weekly from November to April (summer period) 1990/91 at
   two sites: (1) Hay Weir pool on the Munumbidgee River, NSW and (2)
   Carcoar Dan, near Blayney, NSW. During this period the phytoplankton of
   the Murrumbidgee River was dominated by two species of the diatom
   Melosira, and the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. Carcoar Dam was mostly
   dominated by the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena sp.
   The major odour compounds detected were geosmin, beta-cyclocitral,
   beta-ionone, geranylacetone, and 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one. Comparison of
   multivariate statistical analyses of the volatile odour compound
   profiles and algal population data provided strong evidence for the
   hypothesis that the major source of many of these odour compounds was
   the phytoplankton. Total (intra+extracellular) geosmin concentration was
   strongly correlated with Anabaena abundance with no significant
   difference in geosmin production between sites. From the overall average
   of 10 fg geosmin cell(-1) it is possible to predict that taste and odour
   problems, due to geosmin, may be experienced at Anabaena abundances of >
   1,000-2,000 cells ml(-1) in temperate Australian waters.
   beta-cyclocitral concentration was correlated with Microcystis abundance
   at Carcoar Dam (10 fg beta-cyclocitral cell(-1)), but with Anabaena sp.
   abundance at Hay Weir (2 fg cell(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{In-Sensor-Experiments are proposed as a means of providing highly
   informative data concerning the bioprocesses occurring in N-removal
   systems. It is highlighted that the changing nature of both wastewater
   and activated sludge enforces the continuous adjustment of the proposed
   In-Sensor-Experiments to maintain the quality of the sensor's outputs.
   Central to the automated design of the experiments performed in these
   adaptive sensors is a mathematical representation of the processes
   occurring in the device. This model is continuously updated on the basis
   of previously acquired data. It is illustrated how different design
   criteria (objective functions), such as most reliable model selection
   capability or minimal parameter variance, influence the experimental
   designs. The concepts are illustrated with real-life data from two types
   of In-Sensor-Experiments. First short-term (fed-)batch respirometric
   experiments are used to estimate the biokinetics of the nitrifying
   population. Second, a new device is presented in which a sensing element
   is placed at the end of a plug-flow reactor, hence the term
   `'Plug-Flow-Sensor''. The optimally designed and continuously updated
   variation of the flow rate through the plug flow reactor results in a
   retention time distribution. This allows us to monitor a variable as
   function of the reaction time and this within a narrow (user-specified)
   window of reaction times, increasing the measuring frequency and
   accuracy compared to equivalent batch experiments. As a first example,
   ORP is applied as measured variable. By using ORP `'nitrate knees'' can
   be detected after a certain reaction time. This information is an
   indicator of the denitrifying capacity of the sludge.}},

Abstract = {{A well mixed indoor recirculating channel was adopted to investigate
   aerobic heterotrophic biodegradation kinetics and microbial communities
   in drainage systems with suspended and attached biomass. Experiments
   were run with synthetic substrate. The biofilm function was
   distinguished from the suspended biomass by using the Biological Oxygen
   Monitor (BOM) to measure suspended biomass activity. The microbial
   community was overall dominated by filaments (mainly Sphaerotilus
   natans) due to the selection pressure of the soluble organic substrate;
   the biofilm was surface film-dominated because of the low flow velocity
   and shear stress. The channel processes were dominated by the biofilm
   function. However, it was found that the intrinsic Monod kinetic
   constants were mu(max)=2.8 d(-1), K-s=1.8 mg/l for the suspended
   biomass, 1.4 d(-1), 2.7 mg/l for the biofilm biomass, both at 28 degrees
   C; and 0.76 d(-1), 2.5 mg/l, 0.52 d(-1) and 2.9 mg/l respectively fbr
   the two types of biomass, both at 200 degrees C. The specific activity
   of suspended biomass was 50-100\% higher than the biofilm biomass, but
   no significant difference was found between surface and base film
   biomass. Biofilm oxygen uptake rates (BUR) were around 25 gO(2)/m(2).d
   at 28 degrees C, 18 gO(2)/m(2).d at 20 degrees C, and velocity
   dependent. The observed oxygen consumption coefficient of biofilm Y-o/s
   (gO(2)/ggluc) decreased from 50 to 10\% when biofilm surface loading
   increased from 50 to 300 ggluc/m(2).d. The relationship between the
   biomass population, intrinsic kinetics and biofilm performance is

Abstract = {{Water (and its deteriorating quality) may be the most severe stress on
   the exponentially growing human population in the next century. Problems
   are becoming increasingly complex and diverse and require more and more
   specific knowledge, and efficient integration across various
   disciplines, sectors, countries, and societies. The major challenge
   addressed is whether we are prepared to realize the desired integration
   and to resolve the large amount of existing gaps and barriers. The paper
   analyzes major past and desired future trends in water quality
   management. A number of issues are selected such as the identification,
   occurrence, and perception of various problems (e.g. eutrophication,
   acidification, global warming), pollution control types, wastewater
   treatment, modeling and monitoring, planning and environmental impact
   assessment, legislation and institutions, the notion of sustainable
   development, and the role of science and engineering. The past two
   decades showed tremendous developments in water quality management. in
   spite of these, the focus of the present discussion lies mostly on
   pitfalls to disseminate lessons and questions which are crucial to
   likely future problems and desired improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuating populations of small mammals provide an excellent
   opportunity to study the functional and numerical responses of predators
   because of the wide range in prey density that occurs. I reinterpret
   data from six studies that have examined the role of predation in the
   population dynamics of votes in California, southern Sweden and western
   Finland, of snowshoe hares in northern Canada, and of house mice and
   rabbits in Australia. Most studies have measured functional responses by
   relying on changes in diet as reflected by seat or stomach contents.
   These methods are probably biased toward showing predator satiation.
   Contrary to previous conclusions I find that there is little evidence
   for non-linear (Type III) functional-response curves or predator
   satiation at high prey densities. Recent studies indicate that the
   functional and numerical responses of predators can be rapid and strong
   enough to initiate cyclic declines, dampen fluctuations, or even cause
   stable numbers. The exception to this appears to be the irruptions of
   mice and rabbits in Australia. I propose a general explanation for the
   role of predation whereby the effect of predation is largely dependent
   on the entire prey community. When potentially cyclic prey are a small
   component of the overall prey biomass, generalist predators are able to
   prevent fluctuations by strong functional or numerical responses. As the
   prey community becomes dominated by a few species that fluctuate, limit
   cycles predominate. Limit cycles turn into irruptive population dynamics
   when seasonal prey reproduction is eliminated because of extended
   periods of vegetation growth (vegetation flushes following drought). In
   the future we must test assumptions underlying the way we study
   predation by telemetric monitoring of prey mortality and by
   experimentally manipulating predation.}},

Abstract = {{The best method of monitoring ice seal populations in shifting packice
   is by aerial censuses. However, there are a number of problems with this
   method that are difficult to address in the packice and are best
   addressed on more accessible ice seals such as the Weddell seal. Counts
   made during the moult are affected by the fact that Weddell seals can
   leave the fast ice to forage. Seal numbers on the fast ice will
   therefore differ depending upon the proximity and availability of prey
   species, with lower numbers being recorded on the fast ice the further
   the seal has to travel from the ice to find food. In any census the
   subgroup of the population that is being counted must be known. Southern
   elephant seals and Weddell seals haul out to moult in sequences on the
   basis of age, sex and reproductive condition. This leads to periods of
   high and low counts through the moult. Examination of data on crabeater
   seals indicates that a putative 60\% decline in numbers may have been
   due to counts being made at different times of the moult and therefore
   with different subgroups of the population being counted.}},

Abstract = {{The threatened, free-ranging mainland population of the eastern barred
   bandicoot in the Hamilton area of Victoria declined to near extinction
   in late 1992. Demographic changes associated with the decline were
   monitored from 1988 to 1992. About 200 different animals were captured
   in 1988, 49 in 1989, 16 in 1990, 3 in 1991 and 3 in 1992; capture rates
   (number of bandicoots captured per trap-night) displayed a similar
   pattern: 0.5 in 1988, 0.1 in 1989, 0.05 in 1990, 0.05 in 1991 and 0.02
   in 1992. Observed declines lay within the 5\% confidence intervals
   predicted by a demographic model for a population subjected to a removal
   rate of 14 animals per three months (the number removed for captive
   breeding by managers). Removal of bandicoots to stock a captive
   population hastened the demise of the wild population by about seven
   years; however, even in the absence of removals of animals, extinction
   was impending within 5-10 years. Sex ratios were male-biased in all
   years except 1988; the bias may have resulted from stochastic events.
   Average litter sizes did not differ between the 1988 population and
   subsequent populations, except for the 1991 population, in which a
   predominance of non-reproductive females contributed to a strong decline
   in average litter size. These demographic trends illustrate how the
   synergy between stochastic and deterministic forces can rapidly drive a
   small population to extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have revealed that male tree lizards, Urosaurus ornatus,
   have two sexually dimorphic colour badges (throat colour and dorsal
   darkening) that function as status signals. In high-density populations,
   males may darken dorsally to signal dominance; this is a dynamic,
   modifiable badge. To ascertain the circumstances under which this showy
   trait is used, tree lizards were observed under varying social
   conditions in large (2 x 4 m) outdoor pens containing clusters of cinder
   blocks to simulate the natural environment. The three social conditions
   consisted of the following groups (nine or 10 replicates of each): three
   males with one female (MMMF), three males (MMM) and one male with two
   females (MFF). Behaviour and dorsal colour of the males in these groups
   were monitored every other day over a 28-day period using the
   scan-sampling technique. When females were present (MMMF and MFF), one
   male in each group exhibited dominance behaviour and darkened dorsally
   some of the time; in the absence of females (MMM), males infrequently
   exhibited dominance behaviour and dorsal darkening. In groups with
   multiple males (MMMF and MMM), dominant-subordinate relationships
   consistently arose only when a female was present (MMMF). The dominant
   male in each group displayed aggressively significantly more often when
   both other males and a female were present (MMMF). Thus, males use the

   behaviour most readily when females are available to defend.}},

   subantarctic fur seal and Antarctic fur seal, with respective annual
   growth rates of 19.2 and 17.4\%, are reaching the maximum growth rate
   for the genus Arctocephalus. Annual pup censuses at Possession Island
   since 1978 indicate important variations from year to year with pup
   production for A. gazella significantly lower the year after an El Nino
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, but with no such relationship for A.
   tropicalis. Several other long term demographic studies of seabirds and
   marine mammals at different breeding locations in the Southern Ocean
   indicate that the breeding success of several of these predators appears
   to be widely affected in years which appear to be related to the ENSO

Abstract = {{Since Sao Tome and Principe were colonized by Europeans in the 1470s
   alien mammal species have been introduced to these islands.  The impact
   of these introduced species (14 to Sao Tome Principe and 12 to Principe)
   is unknown and though this paper reviews all the available information
   for each alien species no firm conclusions can be gleaned about their
   effect on the native biota of the Republica Democratica de Sao Tome e
   Principe.  Despite the probable long association of many, if not all,
   the alien mammals it is clear that the long history of deforestation and
   habitat modification has had a greater detrimental impact to date. 
   Although all the Red Data Book species are still present it is possible
   that the introduced mammals could cause future population declines and
   extinctions.  Research and surveys are urgently required to discover the
   current status, distribution and ecology of both the native Red Data
   Book species and the alien species.  These surveys, in conjunction with
   the identification of core areas for conservation would allow active
   management to control any detrimental impacts likely to be caused by the
   alien mammals.  Once identified, regular monitoring programmes should be
   undertaken to ensure that the conservation aims are being achieved.  At
   present there is a lack of any really suitable institutional
   organization with the responsibility or skills to undertake the required
   work.  The development of such an organization should be a priority and
   support should be given both in the short and long terms by
   international organizations such as Birdlife International and the Gulf
   of Guinea Conservation Group.}},

Abstract = {{Five and six years old restoration plots in a machine-graded downhill
   ski run at ca. 2500 m a.s.l., were monitored during a three-year period
   to assess in a mid-term the success of ecological restoration. The
   demographic monitoring involved censuses of whole mixed stands.
   The study revealed that transplant losses mostly occurred between the
   third and the fifth year after restoration. Transplant mortality in
   later years was generally low, but ski run maintenance machines may
   apparently damage or destroy some sectors also in older plots. Mean
   survival rates calculated for 1992-1994 in comparison to the beginning
   of the restoration are 67.5-76.4\% in plots MG1 and MG2 restored in
   1986, and 52.6-59.7\% in plots MG3 and MG4 restored one year later.
   Principal demographic features of the studied plots were (a) consistent
   occurrence of the full range of age-state classes and (b) pronounced
   rejuvenation of all plot communities. These aspects indicate an ongoing
   development of plant cover resulting from reproduction of transplants
   and also an extensive immigration of diaspores with subsequent
   development of new populations.
   Transplantations on a local scale and provision of safe-sites by use of
   biodegradable materials are considered indispensable elements in
   ecological restoration of machine-graded alpine ski runs. Demographic
   monitoring of whole plots seems to be very useful to midterm assessment
   of the restoration success.}},

   clonal perennial Carer bigelowii are constructed using a range of

   temperature and nutrient availability would promote growth in a
   qualitatively similar way. The evidence suggests that both tiller size
   and daughter tiller production will increase, and be shifted towards
   production of phalanx tillers which have a greater propensity for
   flowering. Furthermore, age at tillering as well as tiller life span may
   decrease, whereas survival of younger age classes might be higher.
   Mathematical models using experimental data incorporating these
   hypotheses were used to a) integrate the various responses and to
   calculate the order of magnitude of changes in population growth rate
   (lambda), and b) to explore the implications of responses in individual
   demographic parameters for population growth rate. The models suggest
   that population growth rate following climate change might increase
   significantly, but not unrealistically so, with the younger, larger,
   guerilla tillers being the most important tiller categories contributing
   to lambda. The rate of vegetative spread is calculated to more than
   double, while cyclical trends in flowering and population growth are
   predicted to decrease substantially.}},

Abstract = {{The potential use of retinoids and beta-carotene as biomarkers in the
   eggs of the Great Blue Heron was investigated. In the spring of 1991, 65
   eggs were collected from nine heronries (seven along the St Lawrence
   River and two reference sites). A method was specifically developed for
   the extraction and analysis of beta-carotene and the retinoids in heron
   egg yolks by reversed-phase HPLC. When results were expressed either as
   the molar ratio of retinol: retinyl palmitate or as retinyl palmitate
   concentration, significant differences were found between colonies;
   however, retinyl palmitate concentration was deemed the better biomarker
   because it was not significantly influenced by embryonic stage of
   development. Retinyl palmitate concentrations in freshwater colonies
   were negatively related to PCB congeners Nos 105 and 118 as well as
   their TCDD-EQ values (p < 0.02, r(2) = 0.78). Egg tetrachloro-mono-ortho
   biphenyl concentrations were also negatively related to retinyl
   palmitate (p < 0.005, r(2) = 0.90). With the exception of the two
   mono-ortho co-planar congeners detected in the present study, the
   contamination levels found in heron eggs were well below those found for
   other bird species in the Great Lakes area and, so far, no detrimental
   effects have been reported in Great Blue Heron populations in Quebec.
   These results suggest that retinyl palmitate may be useful as a
   sensitive and non-invasive biomarker for monitoring organochlorine
   contaminant effects in the Great Blue Heron in freshwater sites.}},

Abstract = {{Metallothioneins (MTs) are considered central in the intracellular
   regulation of metals such as copper, zinc, and cadmium. Increased MT
   synthesis is associated with increased capacity for binding these metals
   and protection against metal toxicity. Recent advances in the
   biochemistry and molecular biology of MTs have facilitated research on
   MTs in aquatic species. For the bivalve mollusc Crassostrea virginica, a
   species frequently used in studies on the toxicology and environmental
   monitoring of metals, the primary structure for MT has been deduced from
   analysis of the proteins and cDNA. Procedures for analysis of MT
   synthesis and MT gene expression have been applied in studies of
   response to metal exposure. Induction of specific MT forms by Cd is
   concentration- and time-dependent. The levels of MT-bound metals exhibit
   a strong relationship with the cytosolic metal concentrations in a
   metal-exposed natural population of oysters. Ribonuclease protection
   assays using sequence-specific antisense RNA probes have shown that the
   MT mRNA structure in this natural population exhibits considerable
   individual variability in the 3'-untranslated region. Although yet to be
   substantiated, the possibility exists that the distribution of this
   variability may be related to the level of environmental metal
   contamination. One probe derived from the coding region is suitable for
   use in quantitative RPAs for oyster MT mRNAs.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic analyses of population genetic structure, both in the
   laboratory and in the field, have documented significant shifts in
   allozyme genotype frequencies in a variety of aquatic taxa as a result
   of environmental impacts. Studies are documented which indicate that
   contaminants may select for individuals with tolerant allozyme
   genotypes, causing the potential loss of individuals with sensitive
   genotypes. This may diminish the genetic variability and fitness of
   affected populations and make them more susceptible to extinction
   following a subsequent stress. Future research involving population
   genetic structure and ecotoxicology should focus on determining the
   mechanism of sensitivity, documenting multigenerational effects of
   chronic laboratory exposure on population genetic composition,
   investigating whether previously stressed and genetically impacted
   populations are more susceptible to further natural and/or anthropogenic
   stressors, and establishing the utility of population genetic structure
   as a sensitive monitor of impacts in aquatic systems and their
   subsequent remediation.}},

Abstract = {{1.  Predictions based on a genetic control mechanism for vertical
   migration were tested by monitoring the vertical migration behaviour of
   electrophoretically distinct clones of Daphnia longispina and Daphnia
   magna collected from ponds with different levels of predation.
   2.  The number of predator species in a pond (a measure of predation)
   had a significant effect on the vertical migration behaviour of the
   clones found within that pond, and a phenogram constructed on the basis
   of the percentage dissimilarity between the genotypes of the clones
   indicated that clones from the same site were more closely related
   genetically than clones from different sites.
   3.  There were significantly different vertical migration behaviour
   patterns between clones from different sites and between-site variation
   in behaviour was significantly greater than that found within a site.
   4.  Clones differed in the average depth they maintained in the
   waterbody regardless of the pond from which they were collected, but
   clones from the same site did have similar behavioural profiles
   suggesting a tendency to show the same behavioural patterns.
   5.  These findings, which support predictions based on a genetic control
   mechanism, are discussed in relation to phenotypically plastic
   mechanisms of vertical migration control widely reported in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Despite an increased awareness by governments and the general public of
   the need for protecting all types of aquatic habitats, human impacts
   continue to impair the services that these ecosystems provide. Increased
   monitoring activities that focus on all major biological compartments
   are needed to quantify the present condition of Earth's aquatic
   resources and to evaluate the effectiveness of regulations designed to
   rehabilitate damaged ecosystems. Algae are an ecologically important
   group in most aquatic ecosystems but are often ignored as indicators of
   aquatic ecosystem change. We attribute this situation both to an
   underappreciation of the utility of algal indicators among
   non-phycologists and to a lack of standardized methods for monitoring
   with algae.
   Because of their nutritional needs and their position at the base of
   aquatic foodwebs, algal indicators provide relatively unique information
   concerning ecosystem condition compared with commonly used animal
   indicators. Algae respond rapidly and predictably to a wide range of
   pollutants and, thus, provide potentially useful early warning signals
   of deteriorating conditions and the possible causes. Algal assemblages
   provide one of the few benchmarks for establishing historical water
   quality conditions and for characterizing the minimally impacted
   biological condition of many disturbed ecosystems. Preliminary
   comparisons suggest that algal indicators are a cost-effective
   monitoring tool as well.
   Based on available evidence from field studies, we recommend development
   of taxonomic indicators based on diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) as a
   standardized protocol for monitoring ecosystem change. Both population-
   and community-level indices have inherent strengths, and limitations and
   information from both levels of biological organization should be
   utilized in tandem. However, further information concerning species
   tolerances to a variety of anthropogenic stressors is needed if
   autecological indices are to be used routinely for monitoring purposes.
   While functional measures (e.g. productivity) may also prove useful as
   monitoring tools, further investigation is required to characterize the
   reliability of alternative methodologies and to assess the consistency
   of these indicators under varying field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Population sizes and reproductive success in colonies of least terns
   (Sterna antillarum) and black skimmers (Rynchops niger) were examined
   from Massachusetts to Cape May, New Jersey, to determine the utility of
   these species far monitoring population trends and environmental
   quality. Although some colonial species have been monitored for
   reproductive success, most schemes monitor only numbers of breeding
   birds or are more restricted geographically. For least terns in 1991,
   reproductive success was significantly lower on Long Island and higher
   in New Jersey. These differences persisted when compared with reference
   data from the previous 13-15 years for several of the same colonies that
   were relatively uncontaminated. There were no geographical differences
   in reproductive success in 1991 for black skimmers, although western
   Long Island productivity was below normal. The differences in
   reproductive success coupled with stable population numbers suggest that
   southern New Jersey may be providing excess young least terns and black
   skimmers that move into parts of New York with low reproductive success.
   Monitoring population numbers alone may not be adequately sensitive for
   management. Monitoring of productivity though more labor intensive
   allows the early identification of problem regions and temporal trends.
   Regional monitoring of reproductive success may be essential to
   determining the relative importance of protecting specific colonies, and
   for the early recognition of human impacts.}},

Abstract = {{A topical pheromone trap assay was an effective method for assessing the
   resistance status in male Phyllonorycter elmaella (Doganlar and Mutuura)
   moths to the organophosphate azinphosmethyl and the carbamate oxamyl.
   Moths captured in pheromone-baited sticky traps were treated topically
   with a 0.2-mu l droplet of an insecticide solution, which was dispensed
   with a microsyringe to each insect. Several factors affected the
   mortality response of adults including trap adhesive, environmental
   conditions before and during the bioassay, prior field exposure to
   insecticide, and time of collection. The trap adhesives, Tanglefoot and
   Tangletrap, were inherently less toxic to captured moths than Stikem
   Special. High temperature and low humidity in the field before
   collection or later during the bioassay increased mortality. Sublethal
   exposure to azinphosmethyl or oxamyl in the field also increased the
   mortality response of moths in the biosassays. Control mortality
   increased toward the end of each flight period and with each generation.
   Leaf-miners from sprayed orchards were highly resistant to
   azinphosmethyl but are still susceptible to oxamyl. We detected no
   evidence for cross-resistance. Male and female moths were equally
   susceptible to oxamyl. In conclusion, this pheromone trap assay can
   provide rapid information on the susceptibility of P. elmaella
   populations to adulticides and help to select effective control options.}},

Abstract = {{Two pheromone trap assays were evaluated for monitoring insecticide
   resistance of Phyllonorycter elmaella (Doganlar and Mutuura). For both
   assays, male moths were collected in the field with pheromone-baited
   sticky traps. In the first test, we used topical application of 0.2 mu l
   of an insecticide-solvent mixture to the dorsal surface of each moth. In
   the second assay, we incorporated the pesticide into the adhesive so
   that moths were exposed upon capture. The assays were compared for their
   ability to characterize the response to insecticides of susceptible and
   resistant field populations of P. elmaella. Both assays adequately
   described the concentration-mortality response to azinphosmethyl and
   oxamyl of susceptible male P. elmaella moths. However, only the topical
   assay was a suitable method for quantifying the mortality response of
   moths with high azinphosmethyl resistance. Concentration-mortality
   response lines could not be produced with the insecticide-laced adhesive
   assay for azinphosmethyl-resistant moths. Moths from commercial apple
   and cherry orchards treated topically with azinphosmethyl were
   56-71-fold more resistant than moths collected from an isolated
   abandoned site. Azinphosmethyl-resistant P. elmaella male moths were
   still susceptible to oxamyl. Male P. elmaella moths did not avoid traps
   with oxamyl-laced adhesive, but moths from azinphosmethyl-resistant
   populations were repelled by azinphosmethyl at a rate of 10 mg (AI)/g
   adhesive, indicating the possibility of behavioral resistance and a bias
   in the collection of test subjects with this bioassay method. Despite
   these shortcomings, the insecticide-laced adhesive assay may still be
   useful for diagnostic-dose surveys and for resistance detection
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{We compared various sampling procedures to monitor adult emergence of
   feral corn earworm, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), from senescent corn. The
   three techniques compared were as follows: (1) collection of pupae in 94
   fields and holding them in two types of individual emergence cages; (2)
   use of large emergence cages located in 12 selected cornfields; and (3)
   direct observation of nocturnal adult emergence from a plot in a
   cornfield in which the stalks were removed. Most emergence occurred over
   a period of approximate to 7 d, but an extended period of emergence was
   observed with all methods. However, the accuracy of measurement of this
   prolonged emergence period is questionable with the pupal sampling and
   nocturnal observation monitoring techniques because these techniques do
   not account for the larvae still present in the ears when the pupal
   samples are collected or when stalks are removed, respectively. Although
   all three methods indicated that females predominated during the early
   stages of emergence, this phenomenon was more pronounced in direct
   nocturnal observations. Pooling of insects from different fields that
   vary in phenology with pupal sampling and large cage techniques obscures
   the emergence pattern from individual fields, but is more reflective of
   the area-wide emergence pattern. Although area-wide estimates of density
   of populations of emerging adults are best provided by pupal sampling
   because of the large numbers of fields sampled, use of the large
   emergence cages in selected fields is an excellent alternative limited
   only by availability of cages. The best technique depends on use of the
   emergence data, available resources, and specific aspects of the
   situation, with the uniformity of corn phenological development being of
   critical importance.}},

Abstract = {{Juvenile Atlantic salmon and brown trout were depleted at three sites
   (c. 108-380 m(2)) of a natural stream during the summer months of 1991
   and 1992. Local population changes and movements of fish marked in
   sections adjacent to each depleted area were monitored thereafter. There
   was very little movement of marked salmon parr into the central regions
   of the depleted areas following the immediate post-marking period.
   Upstream movement by young-of-the-year fish from high density sections
   in mid-late summer was noted for trout but not salmon. Unmarked
   1-year-old salmon parr immigrated into depleted areas in June 1992, and
   the pattern of recolonization was consistent with migration upstream
   from the adjoining river. It is concluded that resident salmon were very
   strongly site-attached and resource tracking was of no functional
   significance as a compensatory mortality mechanism. The occurrence of a
   long distance migratory component in the population during early-mid
   summer indicates that this, rather than local resource tracking,
   constitutes a potential compensatory mechanism.}},

   population fluctuation patterns of Tylenchorhynchus nudus, Criconemella
   curvata, and Helicotylenchus cornurus in mixed bentgrass and annual
   bluegrass putting greens on two golf courses near Chicago, Illinois, to
   determine if fluctuation patterns could be extrapolated to unsampled
   greens. Fenamiphos-treated and untreated plots were established on seven
   putting greens on two golf courses. Greens were sampled intensively five
   times during the growing season, and statistical comparisons of
   population levels per gram of root were made among dates for each green.
   Population levels per gram of root changed significantly on all greens
   in both years for each of the three nematode populations. Within a
   putting green in either year, population fluctuation patterns in
   fenamiphos-treated and untreated plots were similar. Population
   fluctuation patterns were different between years, however. Within a
   year, population fluctuation patterns among greens showed similarities
   indicating that carefully monitoring a few locations may allow
   extrapolation of population fluctuation data to other locations within
   that year.}},

Abstract = {{The singular and synergistic effects of temperature and free available
   chlorine in the range of 0.1 to 1.2 ppm on the heart rate of the
   sandy-beach bivalve Donax serra were investigated. The aim was to
   identify the possible sublethal impact of a heated and chlorinated
   effluent on a dense bivalve population near the outfall. The heart rate
   of adults, in the presence or absence of chlorine, was recorded at 15,
   20, 25, and 30 degrees C after daily increments of 5 degrees C from 15
   degrees C. One individual from each exposure temperature was transferred
   daily to fresh sea water at 15 degrees C to monitor recovery. Heart rate
   reached a maximum of 44 beats min(-1) at 25 degrees C from a basal rate
   of 15 beats min(-1) at 15 degrees C. The heart rate of those exposed to
   30 degrees C did not return to basal frequency in fresh sea water at 15
   degrees C. On dosing with chlorine, beat frequency immediately dropped
   to half the basal rate as the valves closed and ventilation stopped.
   Below 0.6 ppm and <25 degrees C, the basal rate returned within 24
   hours, and full recovery occurred in fresh sea water at 15 degrees C.
   Results indicated that plume conditions would not be lethal to D. serra
   but that sublethal effects relating to burrowing activity and heart rate
   can be expected.}},

Abstract = {{Enrichment of bacteria from anoxic marine sediments on specific
   carbohydrates yielded a reproducible model system with which to compare
   the degradation of a set of structurally related substrates. The goal
   was to approximate the diversity of natural mixed microbial populations
   while reducing the complexity of studying the degradation of specific
   substrates in sediments. Structurally related substrates were used to
   compare the influence of substrate size, chemical linkage, and
   stereochemistry on carbohydrate degradation. Headspace gases (CO2, H-2,
   CH4, H2S) were monitored by gas chromatography, and carbohydrate
   substrates were separated and quantified with high-pressure Liquid
   chromatography. The sequence of transformations observed in the cultures
   is consistent with the sequential substrate degradation expected in a
   consortium of anaerobic bacteria, and the transfer of carbon from
   substrates through to end products was followed quantitatively. A series
   of experiments showed that mixed cultures of marine bacteria distinguish
   between even small, closely related substrates that do not require
   extracellular hydrolysis prior to uptake. A
   galactose-beta(1,3)-arabinose disaccharide (GLA) was degraded at half
   the rate of seven other similar disaccharides and three larger
   oligosaccharides. Results from transfer cultures indicate that the
   ability to degrade GLA probably is not widespread among bacteria.
   Although neither the component monomers of GLA nor its beta(1,3) linkage
   is uncommon in marine environments, its specific combination of a hexose
   and a pentose may not fit standard carbohydrate transport systems in
   bacteria. Substrate structural features clearly can have a significant
   effect on degradation rates, even at molecular weights below the direct
   transport size limit.}},

   PIGMENT ANALYSIS ALONG A FERRY TRANSECT IN THE SOUTHERN NORTH-SEA}},
Journal = {{NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{In 1991 chlorophyll a was measured continuously by fluorometry on the
   ferry `Norstar', between Zeebrugge and Hull.  In order to assess the
   usefulness of this platform for monitoring of long-term changes in
   phytoplankton distribution in the southern North Sea, calibration
   cruises were carried out in January, April, June and August with RV
   `Holland' to relate algal pigment fingerprints to the fluorescence
   record.  Chlorophyll a concentrations, determined after HPLC separation,
   allowed a quantification of the continuous fluorescence signal.  The
   relation between fluorescence and chlorophyll a content was found to be
   rather constant in June and August and allowed a prediction of the
   chlorophyll a concentration from fluorescence measurements with 21\%. 
   In January and April, however, this relation was different for separate
   hydrographic regions.  In April, a major chlorophyll derivative, an
   allomer indicative of degradation of algal matter, was abundant near the
   Belgian coast.  During the decay of the Phaeocystis bloom, this high
   concentration of allomerized chlorophyll a increased the `background'
   fluorescence signal.  In January, enhancement of fluorescence caused by
   light scattering on non-algal suspended matter could be observed most
   clearly near the English coast, where the algal concentration was low
   (0.5 mug.dm-3) while suspended (inorganic) matter concentration was high
   (30 mg.dm-3).  By applying linear relations, calculated for every
   hydrographic region, prediction of the chlorphyll a concentration could
   be improved to an accuracy of 38\%.
   An analysis of taxon-specific chlorophylls and carotenoids reveals that
   the distribution of individual pigments and of pigment ratios was
   indicative of taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton.  Patterns in
   pigment concentrations along the section suggest the same phytoplankton
   abundance gradients and patchiness as revealed by the continuous
   fluorescence measurement.  A succession in the phytoplankton population
   was apparent:  from diatoms and traces of green algae in January, to a
   spring bloom of Phaeocystis in April close to the Belgian coast, to
   diatom dominance in June, to a mixed population of green algae, diatoms
   and Prymnesiophyceae (probably Coccolithophorids) in August, at the end
   of the vegetative season.  The presence, even occasional abundance, of
   green algae (carrying chlorphyll b) in the southern North Sea has not
   been reported earlier.  The allomerized chlorophyll a concentration was
   most abundant near the coastal ends of the section during all cruises. 
   Apparently, the phytoplankton is an important source of detritus in the
   North Sea.}},

   balaenarum on Namibia's north-western coast. We report new breeding
   distribution records, factors limiting success on the desert coast and
   detail two new methods of catching terns and a new sexing technique.
   Nests occurred as far north as the Cunene River mouth and occurred
   mainly on open gravel plains up to 8 km from the coast. Eggs occurred
   over an 8 month period with a peak in January. Of 66 nests monitored on
   a daily basis, 72\% succesfully hatched, and most of those failing were
   taken by mammals. Incubation was slightly shorter than reported
   previously (19.2d), and heavier chicks emerged from larger eggs. Adult
   plunge diving success was low and records indicate Skeleton Coast Damara
   Terns brought mainly needle fish Tylosurus sp. to their nestling. Two
   new methods to capture adults were developed, noose catching and hand
   capture, both of which avoided nest desertions, and had success rates of
   up to 70\%. Morphologically the sexes differed significantly in bill
   size, allowing a simple and efficient means to separate male and female
   terns. We conclude that Damara Tern populations are more extensive than
   previously thought and further ringing and monitoring of food resources
   is encouraged.}},

   rather constant, irrespective of the degree of human disturbance. Thus,
   both the butterfly species diversity and species richness were more
   dependent on the specialists than the generalists. Our analyses also
   showed that the generalist species were distributed widely over the
   communities, and they maintained high population densities, resulting in
   high rank status in abundance in a community, with more spatial
   variation in density per species. Specialist species showed the opposite
   trends. These results demonstrate that the generalist/specialist concept
   is a powerful tool applicable to analyse the biodiversity and structure
   of natural communities.}},

Abstract = {{Studied the demographic and genetic effects of a volcanic eruption on
   two local populations (Rio Colorado, Las Raices) of the fossorial rodent
   Ctenomys maulinus brunneus, in the Andes. Our data represent a unique
   contribution because the pre-existing demographic data and levels of
   genetic variation were contrasted with the changes monitored afterwards.
   Comparative census data of the breeding population size before and after
   the volcanic eruption, revealed a population decline of about 90\% in
   Rio Colorado. An electrophoretic survey of 23 presumptive enzyme loci
   detected a considerable reduction of genetic variability in both
   populations. In Rio Colorado, the proportion of polymorphic loci (P)
   decreased from 47.8\% to 17.4\%, and the expected heterozygosity (H)
   from 8.9\% to 2.8\%. In Las Raices, P decreased from 50\% to 0\% and H
   from 13.2\% to 0\%. Although low genetic variability in fossorial
   mammals is generally assumed to reflect an adaptation to the stable
   subterranean niche, in some cases it may be merely the result of genetic
   drift.}},

Abstract = {{Perchloroethylene (PCE) is the most widely used solvent in dry-cleaning;
   it is toxic to the liver, kidney and centra nervous system and may be a
   human carcinogen. PCE levels in the ambient air of dry-cleaners' homes
   were measured, and samples of end-exhaled air (alveolar air) from
   subjects who were not themselves occupationally exposed, but who were
   members of the household of dry-cleaners were compared with samples from
   the general population. Thirty apartments were visited housing
   dry-cleaners and their families, and located well away from the
   dry-cleaning premises. Indoor air samples and alveolar air samples were
   collected contemporaneously from the dry-cleaners (36) and members of
   their household (34). The same sampling procedure was followed in 25
   private homes where samples of alveolar air were collected from 41
   subjects who were not occupationally exposed and who acted as control
   group. All the samples were analysed by direct-injection
   gas-chromatography. PCE levels in dry-cleaners' homes proved to be
   significantly higher than in control houses (geometric means: 265 vs. 2
   mug/m3, p < 0.001). PCE levels in the alveolar air exhaled by
   dry-cleaners, their family members and control subjects were
   statistically different (geometric means: 5140, 225 and 3 mug/M3,
   respectively; P < 0.001). PCE is a ubiquitous substance in indoor air,
   but is present at higher concentrations in apartments where dry-cleaners
   and their families live. Biological monitoring of PCE in alveolar air
   confirms that family members of dry-cleaners are more exposed than the

Abstract = {{Exposure of the general population to trichloroethylene and
   tetrachloroethylene under normal environmental conditions, achieved with
   biological monitoring, was assessed, and the possible influence of these
   compounds via drinking water on the body burden was revealed. A total of
   79 subjects with no known solvent exposure was selected, by stratified
   sampling, from the residents of the city of Zagreb. Trichloroethylene
   and tetrachloroethylene were determined in blood, and trichloroethanol
   and trichloroacetic acid were determined in plasma and urine. Drinking
   water samples were also analyzed for trichloroethylene and
   tetrachloroethylene. Concentrations of trichloroethylene and
   tetrachloroethylene in blood, trichloroacetic acid in plasma,
   trichloroacetic acid in urine, trichloroethylene in drinking water, and
   tetrachloroethylene in drinking water were as follows: < 0.015 to 0.090
   mu g/l, < 0.010 to 0.239 mu g/l, 8.6 to 148.1 mu g/l, 1.67 to 102.3 mu
   g/24 h, < 0.05 to 22.93 mu g/l, and 0.21 to 7.80 mu g/l, respectively.
   The variation in all results presented is probably a reflection of
   different environmental contamination with trichloroethylene and
   tetrachloroethylene in the different city areas. Correlation analyses
   revealed significant relationships between trichloroethylene and
   tetrachloroethylene in blood (r = .402, p = .0004); trichloroacetic acid
   in urine and in plasma (r = .522, p = .0000); and trichloroethylene and
   tetrachloroethylene in drinking water (r = .800, p = .0000). A division
   of all parameters into a subgroup (n = 58), taking drinking water
   concentrations of trichloroethylene above 3 mu g/l as a basis,
   demonstrated the same significant relationships as mentioned above.
   Significant correlations, however, appeared between both In
   trichloroethylene and In tetrachloroethylene in drinking water, compared
   with In trichloroacetic acid in plasma and urine, which could be a
   result of the influence of contaminated drinking water on body burden.}},

Abstract = {{Vocal learning in adult indigo buntings was studied by monitoring
   socially paired males housed together in sound isolation boxes. Two of
   three yearlings socially paired with older birds in early spring
   acquired new syllables and reorganized their stereotyped and plastic
   songs, while eleven yearlings socially paired later in the year largely
   Failed to acquire new material, as did the older adults socially paired
   at various times of year.
   Yearlings changed their stereotyped songs to more closely match their
   tutors' by replacing syllables or by inserting new syllables. This song
   matching involved two processes in which adult plastic song played a
   role: (1) new syllables were developed in plastic song, and (2) newly
   mastered or pre-existing syllables were transferred from plastic song
   into stereotyped song. Morphological similarity between yearlings' and
   tutors' syllables strongly influenced which syllables yearlings
   retained. After social pairing, matching syllables tended to be
   delivered more frequently by yearlings and become incorporated into
   their stereotyped songs, while non-matching syllables tended to decline
   in use or be discarded altogether. New syllables were formed from
   existing syllables most morphologically similar to the `'target''
   syllable, through transformation and combination of existing syllables.
   As new forms became more common, old forms declined and eventually were
   discarded.
   Our data suggest that adult indigo buntings maintain the ability to sing
   stereotyped songs while new material is mastered, and held in reserve,
   in plastic song. Acquisition of new syllables in yearling indigo
   buntings requires trial-and-error learning, but proceeds without
   overproduction and subsequent attrition of distinct syllable types, and
   does not substantially rely on improvisation and invention. Rather,
   syllable acquisition and changes to stereotyped songs are strongly
   influenced by the pre-existing syllable repertoire.}},

Abstract = {{1.  Abundance of leaf-mining larvae of the outbreak species Eriocrania
   spp. was monitored in northern Sweden in 1955-67 and 1984-92 in a
   mountain birch forest rejuvenated by an Epirrita autumnata outbreak in
   1954-55.
   2.  Eriocrania mine density fluctuated in a regular biennial pattern,
   probably due to a semivoltine life cycle.  The alternate year
   fluctuations had shifted phase between the two study periods.
   3.  The density fluctuated at a significantly higher mean level and with
   a lower amplitude in the c. 10-year-old forest in the 1960s than in the
   30-year-old forest in the 1980s.  However, no difference was found in
   mine density between c. 30- and >60-year-old stands in the 1980s.
   4.  Significant correlations between the density of mines in
   high-density years and date of budburst, and between rate of change
   between high-density years and the time between snow-melt and budburst
   indicate effects of weather.  No correlation was found between yearly
   average mine density and date of budburst, precipitation or temperatures
   in May or June.
   5.  No correlation was found between the mean densities of Eriocrania
   mines and E. autumnata caterpillars in the same and the two preceding
   years.  However, in the first (1955) and highest of three studied E.
   autumnata peaks a negative effect on population density of Eriocrania
   was indicated.
   6.  A significant, negative correlation between the number of Eriocrania
   mines and E. autumnata caterpillars on single branches was found in
   three out of eighteen years.  The separation of caterpillars and mines
   at branch level indicates an effect of avoidance at intermediate
   population densities.}},

Abstract = {{Although effects of insect herbivory on host plant growth and
   reproduction are well documented, few studies have examined how
   decreases in host plant fitness might influence community-level
   patterns, such as plant succession. The purpose of this study was to
   examine how a specialist flea beetle, Altica subplicata, influences (1)
   the growth and survivorship of its host plant, sand-dune willow (Salix
   cordata), and consequently, (2) patterns of plant succession on sand
   dunes. Growth and mortality of S. cordata were compared over a 3-yr
   period in experimental plots in which host plants were either protected
   from beetle feeding (with mesh cages) or exposed to beetle feeding
   (without cages). The changes in the abundance and biomass of other plant
   species in these experimental plots were also monitored for the 3-yr
   period.
   Growth rates of host plants were significantly influenced by the
   herbivore exclusion treatment. Plants protected from beetle feeding
   added 2.2 times as much height and 2.0 times as much diameter as did
   plants exposed to beetle feeding. Differences between growth rates of
   plants with and without beetles were greater on the west dune, which had
   significantly greater amounts of beetle damage, than on the east dune.
   Furthermore, within plots exposed to beetle feeding, areas with greater
   amounts of beetle damage had significantly lower height and diameter
   growth rates than did areas with lesser amounts of beetle damage. A
   separate experiment showed that mesh cages per se did not influence
   height growth, diameter growth, or number of shoots added over a 2-yr
   period.
   Plant mortality was also strongly affected by the herbivore exclusion
   treatment. Eighty-four percent of the plants that died over the 3-yr
   period of the study were in plots with beetles present. Mortality was 3x
   and 6x higher for plants with beetles than for plants without beetles on
   the east and west dune, respectively. On the west dune, which had higher
   beeetle damage and plant mortality, the amount of beetle damage incurred
   by plants explained 88\% of the variation in plant mortality.
   Herbivory on S. cordata also had significant, indirect effects on the
   changes in abundance of neighboring, non-host plants. For both monocot
   and dicot herbs, there were greater increases in numbers of plants in
   plots with beetle feeding than in plots with beetles absent, but only on
   the west dune with its greater beetle damage. Numbers of herbaceous
   monocots and herbaceous dicots increased 2.5 times and 1.5 times more,
   respectively, in plots with beetles than in plots without beetles. The
   changes in abundance of other Salix plants displayed the same trends,
   but differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, other
   woody plants showed significantly greater decreases in abundance in
   plots with beetles than in plots without beetles on the west dune.
   Individual plant species displayed both positive and negative changes in
   abundance in response to exclusion of herbivores from S. cordata.
   Biomass of two common herbaceous monocots (Juncus spp.) increased more
   in plots with beetles present, but for the most common herbaceous dicots
   (Aster and Solidago spp.), increases were greater in plots with beetles
   absent. Biomass of Salix myricoides, the most common other willow, on
   the east dune increased more in plots with beetles than in plots without
   beetles. In general, species that did not show differential increases in
   abundance also did not show differential growth of already-present
   plants.
   After 3 yr of herbivore exclusion, there were no significant differences
   in species richness, species diversity, or species evenness in plots
   with and without beetles. Thus, herbivory on S. cordata caused increases
   in the abundance of herbaceous plants and decreases in the abundance of
   other woody plants, but over 3 yr did not influence overall species
   diversity. It appears that selective herbivory by Altica subplicata
   directly decreases growth and increases mortality of S. cordata and that
   damage to this single plant species also exerts an indirect impact on
   the patterns of plant succession on sand dunes.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term in vitro genetic toxicity assays have not fulfilled their
   anticipated role in predicting the carcinogenicity of environmental
   agents reliably and economically. A redirection in emphasis from
   nonanimal systems to relevant animal assays and population monitoring
   will help to reestablish the credibility of this field. An analysis of
   the various steps in the carcinogenic process indicates the biological
   responses occurring during these stages can be utilized for early
   detection of environmental carcinogens. Emphasis should be placed on
   using the earliest significant response that indicates genetic damage
   (e.g., gene mutations and chromosome alterations). Assays that detect
   pregenomic damage (e.g., adduct formation), without evidence of
   subsequent heritable genetic alterations, may produce misleading results
   for risk assessment and should not be considered as stand-alone
   monitoring procedures. Late biological responses may occur in tissues or
   organs where genetic damage may be difficult to measure. and the
   opportunity for intervention diminishes as we approach the clinical
   outcome. For example, analyzing localized cells that contain activated
   protooncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressor genes, although they
   further document adverse response from exposure to carcinogens, may be
   of greater Value for indicating clinical outcome than for genetic
   monitoring. With few notable exceptions, the window of opportunity for
   genetic monitoring is the period after exposure where genetic damage is
   evident and where circulating lymphocytes can faithfully record this
   damage. An ongoing study of butadiene-exposed workers illustrates an
   optimum protocol, where multiple assays can be carried out and
   correlated with both external and internal measurements of exposure.
   Population monitoring studies integrating the total effects of multiple
   chemical exposure are especially suited for monitoring communities near
   waste disposal sites or industrial plants. Studies to date indicate that
   these procedures are sufficiently sensitive to detect low-level chronic
   exposure to genotoxic chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Our environmental concerns prompt launching large monitoring programs.
   Examining the history and accomplishments of similar endeavors is the
   best way to avoid errors. One lesson taught by the oldest and largest
   survey of national renewable resources in the United States, the Forest
   Inventory and Analysis Program, is that the program itself is not
   capable of learning from its errors. Among other problems that beset big
   programs are unrealistic promises. It is not possible to inventory
   `'every animal and plant species in the United States and their
   habitats'' as the newly created National Biological Survey vows to do.
   Even if it were possible, this would hardly help to attain the ultimate
   goal of the Survey, survival of all species. In his request to fund the
   Survey, Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, compared the conflict
   between economic development and environmental integrity with train
   wrecks. This metaphor is as brilliant as it is deceitful. Its
   brilliance, attested by the success with the press and legislature, is
   in a vivid and blithe image suggesting that, given sufficient
   information, the conflict could be averted. After all, railroad
   accidents are rare and avoidable exceptions. This hopeful situation
   cannot be honestly compared with the plight of our environment. The
   crucial piece of information - that there is no spare track for economic
   development - is readily available. Our population and economic growth
   take place in the same space that has already been fully occupied by
   other species. To be trustworthy, monitoring programs should face the
   reality that development necessitates environmental degradation.}},

   information is available to implement an insect pest management program.
   In this review, a synthesis is provided of the major components of an
   integrated pest management program for cone and seed insects.  A list of
   the insect pests of conifer cones and seeds in Canada as well as
   features of their life cycles and population dynamics that could
   influence pest management strategies is presented.  Current and future
   needs for insect damage appraisal and insect monitoring techniques are
   discussed.  Finally, the various strategies and tactics to control

Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide-induced
   habitat alteration would reduce snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus)
   populations in early- to mid-successional (<25 years post-treatment)
   stages of sub-boreal spruce forest.
   2. Intensive population sampling and monitoring of vegetation were
   conducted in replicate control and treatment blocks near Prince George,
   British Columbia, Canada from 1988 to 1991. Index line surveys of hares
   also were conducted in 10 paired control-treatment blocks.
   3. Herb biomass and cover recovered to control values by 2-3 years
   post-treatment. Shrub and tree biomass and cover were little affected in
   a `conifer release' treatment where coniferous species dominated these
   layers. In a `backlog conversion' treatment, the dominant deciduous
   trees and shrubs were relatively slow to recover.
   4. Herbicide-induced habitat alteration in optimum habitat seemed not to
   affect abundance of snowshoe hares during summer and autumn.
   5. Post-harvest forest habitats 10-20 years of age may have sufficient
   and persistent vegetative structure, particularly those with a high
   component of coniferous species, to support hare populations regardless
   of herbicide treatment.}},

Abstract = {{A GIS was used to model nitrate leaching losses to surface waters in
   Northern Ireland by integrating a number of datasets, including farm and
   population census data, on a 10 x 10 km grid. This model enabled an
   estimate to be made of the contribution of agriculture, domestic sewage
   and rainfall deposition to the amount of nitrate leached from each grid
   square. The model was also used to predict annual mean nitrate
   concentrations within each grid square and the predictions validated
   against data from a statutory river monitoring programme. Predicted
   annual flow rates and nitrate loadings to watercourses from catchments
   ranging in size from 14.9 km2 to 4453 km2 were compared with estimates
   based on conventional monitoring. In general, the predicted flows and
   loads agreed with observed values to within +/- 10\% for flow rates and
   to within +/- 25\% for nitrate loads. This level of prediction is an
   adequate level on which to base management decisions covering possible
   designation under EC directives. The model predicted that losses of
   nitrate from agriculture accounted for around 70\% of the annual total
   nitrate load to a major watercourse. In the eastern counties of Northern
   Ireland, rainfall and domestic sewage made approximately equal
   contributions to the remaining 30\% of the nitrate leached. However, in
   the less heavily populated western counties of Northern Ireland, the
   contribution from rainfall to the amount of nitrate leached was around
   five times that from domestic sewage.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to characterize the life-histories of
   cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) and yellow starthistle (Centaurea
   solstitialis L.) growing in association.  Biweekly demographic
   attributes were monitored during 1991 (moist spring) and 1992 (dry
   spring).  Data were arranged into life-history tables, and sensitivity
   analysis was performed to determine key transition phases.  The entire
   cheatgrass seed crop reached the soil surface, 41\% of yellow
   starthistle's seed output was lost during seed rain.  Frost heaving
   reduced winter seedling populations of cheatgrass (53\%) more than
   yellow starthistle (40\%).  All cheatgrass seedlings surviving the frost
   heaving period became adults.  Yellow starthistle density was reduced by
   75\% during the juvenile phase.  Cheatgrass adults appeared about 6
   weeks before yellow starthistle adults.  Cheatgrass seed output remained
   about 7,000 m-2 with moist and dry spring conditions.  Yellow
   starthistle seed output was about 21,600 m-2 and 5,200 m-2 with moist
   and dry spring conditions, respectively.  Reduction of yellow
   starthistle seed output with dry spring conditions suggest oscillatory
   community dynamics.  Key processes associated with life-history
   transitions were interference (competition), resource acquisition rates
   and duration, and reproductive allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Leptosynapta clarki is a brooding apodid sea cucumber found on the
   intertidal mudflats on the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada, In
   the early spring (April/May), juveniles burrow into the sediment after
   release from the mother by rupturing of the body wall. There is
   potential for dispersal after release, but the juveniles form a distinct
   recruitment pulse in the adult habitat. Monitoring of the population in
   the field shows rapid growth from a mean size of 1 to 2 mm at release to
   a maximum of 16 mm in August. After August, the juveniles become
   pigmented and are indistinguishable from the adult population. Growth
   estimates from the laboratory show that during the reproductive season
   following their birth (November to December), the sea cucumbers are a
   maximum of 35.5 mm in length (mean 18.7 mm), and are reproductively
   active as males. At the age of 1 yr the mean size is 21.1 mm with a
   maximum length of 44 mm. This study provides the first data on
   recruitment in an apodid sea cucumber and provides detailed information
   on the growth rates and early life history of L. clarki.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of submerged aquatic macrophytes to coastal ecosystems
   has generated a need for knowledge of minimum light levels that will
   support the maintenance and restoration of healthy populations. Our
   goals were (1) to evaluate the sensitivity to natural, non-sinusoidal
   fluctuations in irradiance I of analytical integration techniques for
   calculating daily carbon gain, (2) to evaluate the H-sat (the daily
   period of I-saturated photosynthesis) model of daily production relative
   to models based on instantaneous photosynthesis vs irradiance (P vs I)
   and (3) to provide some guidance for the temporal density of irradiance
   data required for accurate estimation of daily carbon gain. Monthly
   measures of the P vs I response of an eelgrass Zostera marina L.
   population were used to predict rates of daily carbon gain from
   continuous in situ recordings of I. Daily integrated I was not a
   reliable predictor of daily production. Numerical (iterative)
   integration of H-sat was much more reliable but required repeated
   measures of I within a day, as did numerical integration of P vs I.
   Analytical (non-iterative) models based only on observations of I-m
   (noon) could not predict daily production accurately. Analytical models
   of P vs I and H-sat agreed with each other, however, indicating that the
   analytical models may be useful where the daily pattern of I is
   sinusoidal. Given the high degree oi temporal variability in coastal
   light environments, continuous monitoring of light availability may be
   required for calculation of daily production and reliable management of
   aquatic macrophyte populations.}},

Abstract = {{Dokai Bay lies adjacent to Kitakyushu city, one of Japan's major cities
   with a population of more than 1000000. In this city, various heavy
   chemical-industrial plants have been established since the 1900s. Waste
   water from the factories and untreated sewage effluent from the city
   have heavily polluted the water and marine bottom environment of the
   bay. In the 1960s, this bay was called the `dead sea' owing to the
   apparent absence of aquatic organisms. Since 1970, environmental
   recovery projects have been carried out by the local government. The
   effluent and waste water have been severely regulated. The polluted
   bottom sediments of the bay have been dredged. Consequently, in the past
   two decades, the environmental conditions of the bay have dramatically
   recovered. Since 1989, we have assessed the water and benthic conditions
   of the bay to describe the recovery of the benthic ecosystems, and to
   monitor the effects of environmental recovery projects on the bottom
   environment of the bay since 1970. The results of these studies indicate
   a drastic decrease in the levels of heavy metals in the bottom sediments
   and the recolonization of various benthic organisms, although the
   innermost areas of the bay remain seriously organically polluted. In
   these areas, in the summer, the benthic communities are seriously
   damaged owing to the occurrence of anoxic water masses. Prior to 1993,
   there was no regulation of the amount of nutrient salt loading present
   in factory waste water and city sewage. Overloading of nutrient salts
   generates large amounts of primary production by phytoplankton, and
   results in the overloading of organic matter at the bottom environment
   in the innermost areas of the bay, For further recovery of the ecosystem
   it is necessary to control the total amount of loading of nutrient salts
   to the bay system.}},

Abstract = {{Growth patterns of seed-inoculated fluorescent pseudomonads in the
   spermospheres of sugar beet in soil or sand maintained at -15 J/kg and
   16 C were monitored over a 72-h time period. When incubated in soil,
   strains 33-2 (Pseudomonas putida), Al (P. fluorescens), and ML5 (P.
   fluorescens-putida) exhibited relatively short lag phases (<4 h), with
   most growth occurring during the first 12 h. Strains F42 (P. putida) and
   PGS12 (P. aureofaciens) exhibited long lag phases (8-12 h), and their
   populations increased mainly between 12 and 24 h. Doubling times during
   the exponential growth phases were 2-3 h for air strains except P.
   syringae strain B728a, which had the longest doubling time (5-7 h). Most
   strains reached the stationary phase within 24 h after planting of seed.
   Growth rates of bacteria in spermospheres of seed planted in sand were
   similar, except some strains continued to grow past 24 h. When seeds
   were inoculated with bacteria at 10(6)-10(8) cfu per seed, the incidence
   of pericarp colonization by Pythium ultimum within 48 h in soil was less
   in seeds treated with strains with short lag phases than in those
   treated with long lag phases. However, the efficaciousness of these
   strains was essentially negated when soil contained a high population of
   the fungus. The high bacterial inoculum density was important, as there
   was a linear relationship between inoculum densities and percentage of
   pericarp colonization by P. ultimum. To determine if bacterial cells
   were active or dormant (or dead), cells were incubated in a solution of
   2-(rho-indophenyl)-3-(rho-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride
   (INT). The percentage of INT-active cells on seed with initial
   population densities of 10(7)-10(8) cfu per seed ranged from about
   17.2-55.9\% at 0 h to 85.8\% at 48 h. The percentage of INT-active cells
   peaked at 6-12 h for the short lag phase strains. No clear relationship
   between efficacy of strains in reducing pericarp colonization and the
   percentage of metabolically active cells was detected. On the other
   hand, the finding that a significant percentage of cells are
   metabolically active following inoculation of seed with high-density
   inocula explains in part why protection of the pericarp against P.
   ultimum is better even though multiplication cannot be detected. Thus,
   competition for nutrients and the production of secondary metabolites
   occurs in the absence of increasing cell number.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive cycle of the sponge Halichondria panicea was
   investigated at Boknis Eck in the Western Kiel Bight over 2 yr, and over
   1 yr on the island Helgoland in the North Sea and was compared with
   material collected earlier at Tjarno at the Swedish west coast. 
   Temperature and salinity were monitored at the different stations in
   order to determine whether different hydrographic conditions could be
   linked to differences in seasonal patterns of the reproductive cycle.
   The results showed H. panicea to be gonochoristic at all stations.  The
   ratio of males to females varied between populations and years, but
   females predominated consistently.  Comparison of the reproductive cycle
   in the years 1987 and 1989 at the brackish-water station Boknis Eck
   shows that high ambient winter and spring temperatures in 1989 resulted
   in a shorter period of oogenesis and earlier larval release, as compared
   to the year 1987.  The reproductive cycle of the sponges at the fully
   marine station at Helgoland in 1989 and the brackish-water station at
   Tjarno in 1978 under temperature and salinity conditions similar to
   those at Boknis Eck in 1989 showed the same seasonal pattern.  We
   conclude that the lower salinities found at both Boknis Eck and Tjarno
   do not cause a delay or slow-down of reproduction at these stations as
   compared to Helgoland.  Under favourable temperature conditions,
   oogenesis was highly synchronous within the different populations, while
   it was more spread over time under the low ambient water temperatures at
   Boknis Eck in 1987.}},

   annual survival rate of 0.858 +/- 0.039. Mortality causes and erratic
   behavior of immature birds are considered in order to assess the

Abstract = {{We monitored the diet of the Heermann's gull (Larus heermanni) and the
   elegant tern (Sterna elegans) between 1983 and 1992 and compared the
   proportion of each fish species in the diet, through a correlation
   analysis, with the proportion of each of these same fish species in the
   commercial landings. We found strong positive correlations between the
   proportion of sardine (Sardinops sagax caeruleus) in the seabirds' diet
   and sardine landings. Strong negative correlations were found between
   the proportion of sardine in the seabirds' diet vs the proportion of
   anchovy (Engraulis mordax) in the birds' diet and anchovy landings. The
   proportion of sardine landings was negatively correlated with the
   proportion of anchovy in the seabirds' diet and with the proportion of
   the landings of both anchovy and mackerel (Scomber japonicus). The
   proportion of anchovy in the seabirds' diet was positively correlated
   with anchovy landings. A low, marginally positive correlation was found
   between the proportion of mackerel in the diet and the proportion of
   mackerel landed. Dietary studies of these seabirds provide reliable data
   on species composition of fish stocks, estimates of relative abundance,
   and availability of fish populations to higher trophic levels in this
   area. They also provide real-time, predictive, catch-independent data
   and complement commercial and research catch information.}},

Abstract = {{To determine impacts of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, on
   bivalves in Lake St. Clair, densities of Unionidae in 1990 and 1992
   (after D. polymorpha invasion) were compared with densities in 1986
   (before D. polymorpha). Declines in density occurred mainly at sites in
   the southeastern portion of the lake where unionids were highly infested
   with D. polymorpha. Unionid densities at highly infested sites declined
   from 2.4/m(2) in 1986, to 1.8/m(2) in 1990, and to O/m(2) in 1992.
   Unionid species with light-weight shells that brood larvae over an
   extended period declined more between 1986 and 1990 than heavy-shelled,
   short-term brooders. Unionid densities at lightly infested sites located
   mainly in the northwestern portion of the lake did not decline: mean
   densities were 1.4/m(2) in 1986, 1.6/m(2) in 1990, and 1.4/m(2) in 1992.
   While the mean number of D. polymorpha per unionid was <1 at these
   lightly infested sites in 1990, it increased to 35 by 1999. Given this
   relatively slow increase in D. polymorpha per unionid in this portion of
   the lake, continued monitoring of populations should provide a better
   understanding of the relationship between the extent of infestations and
   unionid mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Many forest-dwelling small mammals feed on the sporocarps of hypogeous
   fungi, but the nutritional value to small mammals of these sporocarps is
   thought to be low. This study investigated the value of hypogeous
   sporocarps to a mycophagous marsupial, the Tasmanian bettong, Bettongia
   gaimardi, by monitoring diet composition (via fecal analysis) and
   energetics in a free-ranging population in relation to variations in
   sporocarp production. The occurrence of fungus in the diet reflected
   sporocarp production. When production was high, the animals were almost
   exclusively mycophagous, while at lower levels of production they added
   dicot fruit and leaf to the diet. Females were slightly but consistently
   more mycophagous than males. Body condition in both sexes tended to
   increase with increased representation of fungus in the diet. Further,
   rates of energy turnover in females and growth rates of pouch young were
   positively related to sporocarp production. These observations suggest
   that hypogeous sporocarps are a primary food resource of high value to
   this marsupial.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the scorpion Cercophonius squama and the terrestrial
   amphipod, Family Tallitridae, were monitored by pitfall trapping in
   southeastern Australia for 8 yr as part of a field experiment to study
   the effects of habitat fragmentation and remnant habitat patch size an
   biological diversity, for 3 yr prior to the fragmentation treatment, and
   5 yr thereafter.
   The abundance of scorpions did not change significantly with habitat
   fragmentation and there was no discernible effect of remnant size. The
   abundance of amphipods in the remnants relative to that in the controls
   decreased markedly after fragmentation, more so on smaller remnants than
   on larger ones. By reason of their ecological and biological
   characteristics, scorpions seem resistant to the changed ecological
   conditions brought about by habitat fragmentation, at least in the short
   term, whereas amphipods are more susceptible.
   It is not yet possible to generalize about the responses of species to
   habitat fragmentation. Management of fragmented ecosystems to maintain
   biological diversity should be directed at populations of species
   because different species respond differently.}},

Abstract = {{In 1990 and 1991, we monitored the abundance of a carabid community in a
   8 ha winter cereal field. The field was subdivided by five 1.5 m wide
   weed-strips leaving 12, 24 and 36 m between the strips. In 1990
   significantly higher activity densities and number of species were found
   in the strips. In 1991, however, both number of species and activity
   densities of ground beetles in the weed-strips and the cereal parts in
   between were similar. In 1991, activity density in cereal parts between
   weed-strips was significantly higher than in a bordering control area.
   Most of the activity densities of all 23 abundant species were
   significantly higher in the strip-managed area than in the control area.
   Furthermore, the number of species in the strip-managed area was higher.
   In addition, most sampling dates (1990 and 1991) revealed a significant
   negative regression between activity density and distance from the first
   strip, i.e. width of the cereal parts between the strips.
   Strip-management seems to be a way to increase ground beetle densities
   considerably by providing better food supplies and more suitable
   overwintering sites.}},

   for males of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), with
   blacklight, water-pan, Heliothis-cone, and delta-wing traps, along with
   sweep-net samples of grassy areas near potato fields were conducted at
   four sites in 1990 and 1991 on Prince Edward Island.  Compared with the
   blacklight trap, the water-pan trap caught 1.72 times more males in 1990
   and 1.97 times more males in 1991.  The Heliothis-cone and delta-wing
   traps, and sweep-net samples were ineffective for male European corn
   borer.  Blacklight traps required significantly more time to sample than
   any of the pheromone-based traps.  A water-pan trap is an effective tool
   to monitor adult males of the European corn borer in potatoes on Prince
   Edward Island.  In 1992, the mean number of males per pan trap per week
   was 7.4 for the Iowa strain, 1.1 for the New York strain, 0.6 for the
   hybrid strain, and 1.1 for an unbaited trap.  This suggests that the

Abstract = {{Insect populations in 14 bins of newly harvested wheat on eight farms in
   Kansas were monitored with sticky traps in the bin headspace and with
   grain samples.  Sticky trap catches during the first 3 wk of storage
   were used to provide an estimate of the species and densities of insects
   that were present in the headspace.  Grain samples were taken every 2 wk
   during the first 3 mo of storage to provide an estimate of population
   growth under the grain temperature and moisture conditions in the bins. 
   The sticky traps correctly predicted whether lesser grain borer,
   Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), and rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes
   ferrugineus (Stephens), would be found in the grain samples in 85.8 and
   78.6\% of the bins, respectively.  Traps were less reliable for foreign
   grain beetle, Ahasverus advena (Waltl), and hairy fungus beetle, Typhaea
   stercorea (L.), with correct predictions in 57.1 and 42.9\% of bins,
   respectively.  Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner), was
   found in both traps and grain samples in only one bin and red flour
   beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and sawtoothed grain beetle,
   Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), were not found in both traps and grain
   samples in any of the bins.  The traps in the center of the bin caught
   4.7-14.2 times more beetles than those on the bin walls, but only 1.3
   times more P. interpunctella adults.  The total numbers of C.
   ferrugineus adults in the grain samples could be predicted better from
   the product of mean grain temperature times maximum grain moisture than
   from sticky trap catch.}},

Abstract = {{The nuclear polyhedrosis virus of Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hubner) was
   released into soybean fields at two sites in Louisiana.  The spread of
   the virus outside release plots was monitored by sampling A. gemmatalis
   larvae, predatory arthropods and parasitoids of A. gemmatalis, and soil.
   According to A. gemmatalis sampling, the virus spread at a rate of 0.8
   and 1.2 m/d at the Crowley and Baton Rouge sites, respectively, within
   almost-equal-to 6 wk after it was released.  The virus spread distances
   of up to 44 and 58 m at Crowley and Baton Rouge, respectively, during
   that season.  The rate of spread detected in A. gemmatalis was
   significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with the rate detected by sampling
   and bioassay of predatory arthropods and parasitoids, primarily the
   former.  There also was circumstantial evidence implicating birds and
   farm machinery in viral transport; 80\% (n = 15) of bird droppings
   sampled at the Baton Rouge site during viral spread contained viable A.
   gemmatalis nuclear polyhedrosis virus.  The rate of spread did not
   differ by direction from release plots.  The prevalence of viral disease
   decreased at increasing distances from release plots for 3 yr after
   release at the Crowley site and during the 1st yr at Baton Rouge.  The
   amount of virus in soil after the first season at the Crowley site
   decreased from 3,598 polyhedral inclusion bodies per gram in the release
   plots to 131 and <1 polyhedral inclusion bodies per gram at distances of
   46 and 114 m, respectively, but this decrease was not significant.}},

   15-0.15-m twig segments in 1992.  Fungal pathogen activity was barely
   discernable on tree-borne aphids in the orchard but was observed more
   frequently from aphids infesting weeds beneath the trees.  An epizootic
   of Entomophthorales occurred on aphids infesting solanaceous (potatoes)
   and nonsolanaceous hosts in home gardens in Moscow and Troy, (Latah
   County), Idaho, in 1991.  Verticillium lecanii (Zimmerman) Viegas was
   identified from M. persicae on peach leaves; Beauveria bassiana (Bals.)
   Vuillemin and Conidiobolus sp. were identified from aphids on potatoes. 
   Aphids collected from weeds growing in and near the peach orchard were
   infected with Entomophthora chromaphidis Cornu, Conidiobolus coronatus
   (Constantin) Batko, C. obscurus (Petch) Hall \& Dunn, and V. lecanii. 
   Aphids on potatoes and nonsolanaceous hosts at Moscow and Troy were
   infected with Pandora neoaphidis (Remaudiere \& Hennebert) Humber, E.
   chromaphidis, and Conidiobolus spp.  Aphid populations were much lower
   in 1992 both within the orchard and in potatoes.}},

Abstract = {{The air monitoring system in Upper Silesia has provided abundant data on
   airborne pollutants. Air quality in this region is bad: a concentration
   of several gases, volatile compounds, metals, and complex mixtures of
   organic compounds carried by small particulate matter exceeds both daily
   and yearly admissible levels. About 250 individual polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbonds (PAHs) were identified in airborne pollutants. and
   hundreds of not identified compounds are seen on gas chromatographic
   profiles as minor peaks. Among PAHs are present compounds with known
   carcinogenic potency for humans. Seasonal variation with distinctly
   lower concentration of pollutants in summer than in winter was noticed.
   Fifteen PAHs including benzo{[}a]pyrene (B{[}a]P) determined by GC-MS
   method in 20 measuring points showed constant relative proportions. Thus
   B{[}a]P could be used as a representative compound for other PAHs. In
   urban areas, a core of Silesia values for B{[}a]P concentration ranged
   from 60 to 90 ng/m(3) in winter to 5 to 20 mu g/m in summer.
   Mutagenicity tested on Salmonella strains showed seasonal variation with
   distinctly higher values in winter. Environmentally exposed humans
   showed a higher level of PAH-DNA adducts in WBC than the control
   population from rural area. Total organic extract of smalt particulate
   matter exhibited both direct and indirect mutagenic activity, induced
   formation of micronuclei in bone marrow cells of BALB/c mice, induced
   chromosomal rearrangements, and increased sister chromatid exchange
   index.}},

Abstract = {{Exact measurements or modeling of human exposures to environmental
   pollutants are of crucial importance for a realistic evaluation of
   public health risks. Current concepts, however, often use assumptions
   that result in overly conservative assessments of public health risks.
   Too frequently the dose of the pollutant retained in the body is
   approximated by oversimplified predictions assuming that all that is
   inhaled remains in the organism, that pollutant concentrations in
   various microenvironments are identical to those recorded by remote
   monitors, that the residence indicates the sire where people spend all
   their time, and that the urban population is continuously exposed to
   outdoor air for 24 hr/day and 70 years/lifetime. The review shows that
   in intermittent exposures only a fraction of inhaled toxicants remains
   in the body, that pollutant concentrations differ largely from one
   microenvironment to another, and that human activity patterns must be
   incorporated in every realistic exposure assessments. Specifically, the
   probability of being exposed to a short peak of ozone is predetermined
   in variable urban concentrations primarily by the coincidence of
   exercising outdoors at the time and site of elevated ozone levels. When
   combined with a physiologically based exposure evaluation, this
   probabilistic approach provides a scientifically sound estimate of
   actual occurrences of adverse exposures and a realistic assessment of
   potential health hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are exposed to a large number of environmental genotoxic agents.
   These can increase the probability that somatic mutation will occur. The
   use of genotoxicity testing is essential for assessment of potential
   human toxicity so that hazards can be prevented. Cytogenetic monitoring
   of human populations exposed to chemicals has proved to be a useful tool
   for detecting the chemical mutagenic effects. Cytogenetic analysis of
   human chromosomes in peripheral lymphocytes allows direct detection of
   mutation in somatic cells. Cytogenetic monitoring of a group of traffic
   policemen from Cairo, Egypt, was an example of a human population study.
   The induction of chromosomal damage was studied in a group of 28 traffic
   policemen with exposure of over 10 years and a control group of 15
   policemen trainers. Blood lead level was significantly higher in the
   traffic policemen (30 +/- 8.7) unit compared to the control group (18.2
   +/- 1.2) unit. The percentage of chromosomal aberrations (7.7 +/- 3.1),
   as well as the mean sister chromatid exchanges (7.5 +/- 3.4), were
   significantly higher among the traffic policemen than in the control
   group. The percentage of chromosomal aberrations was 2.8 +/- 2.1 and the
   mean sister chromatid exchanges was 4.8 +/- 2.9 in the control group. On
   the other hand, the increase in chromosome damage among the traffic
   policemen was enhanced further by smoking. Several problems that are
   found in biomonitoring studies are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In a synthesis of outbreak characteristics of common defoliating insects
   in British Columbia, two types emerge: those with fast-cycling outbreaks
   and those with sustained outbreaks. Species with fast-cycling outbreaks
   rise quickly to visible defoliation levels, cause significant growth
   loss, tree deformation and mortality, and disappear just as quickly.
   Impact is closely related to the severity of defoliation during the
   first year of an outbreak; consequently, the objective of managing these
   species should be to reduce populations before defoliation occurs, i.e.
   to prevent the outbreak. To accomplish this objective, identification of
   susceptible habitats and monitoring with sensitive pheromone traps in
   areas of expected outbreaks are necessary to detect upwelling
   populations. Species with sustained outbreaks cause significant growth
   losses only after defoliation continues for a number of years. Tree
   mortality usually is not important except where regeneration is being
   nurtured under a selective or shelterwood silvicultural system. Impact
   can be significant over the life of a stand because of the length and
   frequency of outbreaks, but treatments effective for only 1 year usually
   cannot be justified except where it is important to retain a full crown.
   Long-term cultural methods appear to be the preferred management system
   and, of these, utilizing nonhost species or resistant or phenologically
   asynchronous host species may be the best option. Again, determining the
   location of expected outbreaks is an important component of a management
   system and, at present, identifying stands by frequency of outbreak
   within zones of climatic suitability would be useful in selecting
   treatment areas.}},

Abstract = {{1.  The year-round movements and nesting activities of snowy plovers
   that bred on the California coast in the Monterey Bay and Point Reyes
   areas were closely monitored between 1984 and 1989.
   2.  About half of 208 females and a quarter of 190 males with histories
   of one or more complete breading seasons were absent from focal nesting
   areas for all or part of at least one breeding season.  The incidence of
   such absences in the population was 41\% in females and 16\% in males,
   as estimated from regular nesters at the focal areas.
   3.  Partial-season absence was far more common than entire-season
   absence for regular nesters in the focal areas.  Presence for
   partial-seasons was more common than presence for entire seasons for
   irregular nesters in the focal areas.
   4.  Of 147 plovers with any absences, 25 females and 14 males were found
   during the breeding season from 50 to 1140 (median = 175) km from their
   study area nesting sites.  Positive or highly suggestive evidence of
   nesting at alternative locations was documented for 16 females and seven
   males.  Movements were both north and south.  We found evidence only for
   movements of individuals, not pairs.
   5.  Winter migrants were more likely than residents to make
   long-distance movements, a phenomenon partly attributable to birds that
   typically migrate to their nesting area making occasional nesting
   attempts on their wintering grounds.  During years that the nesting
   season began exceptionally early at one focal area, some winterers made
   very early nesting attempts and in years in which they returned before
   July, some made late attempts in their wintering areas.
   6.  There was no relationship between breeding success and long-distance
   movement.
   7.  The large difference between female and male long-distance breeding
   dispersal rates is hypothesized to be due to the species' variable and
   widely spaced nesting habitat, polygamous nesting strategy, parental
   roles, and possibly the exercise of female mate choice.}},

Abstract = {{The expressions of factorial (sigma(s)2) and stochastic (sigma(s)2)
   components of phenotypic variance of bilateral characters are given,
   regarding simple connection of the latter to the fluctuating asymmetry
   indicator, being traditionally used for assessment of developmental
   stability.  The values of both components were calculated for 5 meristic
   characters in 172 samples of bream collected over most of its geographic
   range.  The sigma(s)2 values were to indicate possible effects of
   genetic disbalance and to measure environmental stress, while sigma(f)2
   was regarded as a rough estimate of the genetical heterogeneity.  It was
   found that sigma(s)2 values tended to grow in following situations:  a)
   zones of interpopulational contacts or in populations with unusual
   morphology; b) zones of increased anthropogeneous pollution, in
   particular in the lower parts of the artificial reservoirs as compared
   to the upper parts and the majority of rivers and lakes.  On the other
   hand, sigma(f)2 values in lakes appeared to be lower than in rivers,
   probably due to comparatively low genetic heterogeneity of the lake
   populations.  The whole set of samples exhibits another clear trend: 
   negative correlation between sigma(s)2 and sigma(f)2, which seems to
   illustrate a well-known connection between developmental homeostasis and
   heterozygosity.  A conclusion may be made that the phenotypic variance
   components are useful in ecological and genetical monitoring of large
   population systems, although the data are often difficult to interpret
   properly for separate populations.}},

Abstract = {{There are four stereoisomers of both 3-methyl-octan-4-ol, the
   aggregation pheromone of the African palm weevil, Rhynchophorus
   phoenicis (F.) and 5-methyl-octan-4-ol, the aggregation pheromone of the
   palmetto weevil, Rhynchophorus cruentatus (F.). Synthetic stereoisomers
   of 3-methyl-octan-4-ol and 5-methyl-octan-4-ol were baseline-separated
   on a Cyclodex-B fused silica column. Use of this column in gas
   chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and GC-mass
   spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses revealed that only one stereoisomer,
   (3S,4S)-3-methyl-octan-4-ol and (4S,5S)-5-methyl-octan-4-ol, is produced
   by male R. phoenicis and male R. cruentatus, respectively, and elicits
   good antennal responses by conspecific male and female weevils. In field
   trapping experiments, with R. phoenicis in Cote d'Ivoire and R.
   cruentatus in Florida, (3S,4S)-3-methyl-octan-4-ol and
   (4S,SS)-5-methyl-octan-4-ol strongly enhanced attraction of fresh palm
   tissue, whereas other stereoisomers were behaviorally benign.
   Stereoisomeric 3-methyl-octan-4-ol and 5-methyl-octan-4-ol may be
   utilized to monitor and/or manage populations of these two palm weevils.}},

Abstract = {{Weekly catches of adult male Campylomma verbasci (Meyer) in sex
   pheromone-baited wing traps provided a seasonal record of flight
   activity during 1991 in apple orchards and patches of mullein in the
   interior of British Columbia. The first of two periods of flight
   activity reflected migration from apple to mullein, and the second
   probably represented two generations on mullein followed by migration
   back to apple. Monitoring of adult male C. verbasci using sex
   pheromone-baited traps in fall of 1990 and 1991 followed by limb-tap
   samples for first-generation nymphs the following years showed a
   significant positive relationship between fall catches and density of
   nymphs in conventional apple orchards. This result suggests that a
   pheromone-based monitoring system during fall could be developed to
   predict the density of nymphs the following spring, There was no such
   relationship in organic orchards, where adult population in the fall
   were similar to those in conventional orchards, but mean counts of
   nymphs in the spring were 20 times lower. Two probable hypotheses could
   account for this disparity. Either female C. verbasci lay fewer
   overwintering eggs in organic orchards or mortality is higher, possibly
   resulting from biological-control agents acting in some organic
   orchards.}},

Abstract = {{Temperatures in aerated and unaerated corn stored in 2,545.45-kg
   (100-bushel) bins from 15 October 1992 to 3 June 1993 in Savannah, GA,
   were monitored at seven different sites within each bin. The corn was
   infested periodically with adult maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais
   Motschulsky, adult red flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and
   eggs of the Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner), and the
   almond moth, Cadra cautella (Walker), at selected intervals during
   storage. Bins were sampled each month using pitfall traps, cardboard
   traps, and a grain trier. Average daily temperatures in aerated bins
   were 11.49-15.49 degrees C compared with 15.27-18.70 degrees C in
   unaerated bins. Average temperatures at six of the seven sample
   positions were significantly greater in unaerated than in aerated bins.
   Total degree accumulations ranged from 2,654 to 3,527 degrees C in
   aerated bins and 3,740 to 4,320 degrees C in unaerated bins. Trap
   samples and trier samples were taken monthly at the approximate position
   of the temperature probes (seven positions, seven monthly samples); moth
   counts from cardboard traps were combined as one value per bin. During
   the sampling period, the average numbers of trapped maize weevils and
   red flour beetles were significantly greater in unaerated bins than in
   aerated bins for eight and 13 position comparisons, respectively (seven
   positions x seven monthly samples = 49 possible comparisons). The
   average numbers of Indianmeal moths and almond moths were significantly
   greater in unaerated than in aerated bins for two of seven and one of
   seven monthly samples, respectively. Moisture content was significantly
   greater in unaerated than in aerated corn for 43 of 49 sample
   comparisons for the entire study.}},

Abstract = {{Three aerated, commercial stores of 5000-10,000 t of wheat in England
   were discovered to have surface infestations of Sitophilus granarius in
   mid-winter when the grain temperature was 4-9-degrees-C.  The
   infestations were monitored using pitfall and probe traps and catches
   dropped to zero after the application of etrimfos or pirimiphos-methyl
   2\% dust into the top 0.3 m at 50g/m2.  The effects of surface
   treatments in cooled bins were also examined in a farm scale experiment.
   Six, 20 t bins of wheat, were each aerated at 10 m3/h/t with an 0.02 kW
   fan and infested with 1/kg each of S. granarius and Oryzaephilus
   surinamensis and 0.5/kg of Cryptolestes ferrugineus as well as the mites
   Glycyphagus destructor and Acarus siro.  The surface of three bins were
   treated with 45 g/m2 of 2\% pirimiphos-methyl dust.  Insect numbers, as
   determined by pitfall traps and probe traps at the surface, 1 and 2 m,
   fell in all bins during the winter as temperatures fell to 5-degrees-C. 
   As the bins warmed up in the spring, numbers of O. surinamenis rose
   again in the untreated bins.  In the second year, S. granarius reached
   peak numbers in the untreated bins in mid-winter.  The much lower
   numbers of insects trapped in the treated bins were a result of the
   surface treatment and the few found may have been attributable to
   migration from the untreated bins.  A. siro and G. destructor, together
   exceeded 1500/kg at the surface of untreated bins, but were less than
   10/kg in treated bins.  In the second year, few of either species were
   found and the predatory mite, Cheyletus eruditus, reached 200/kg in all
   bins, before declining.  The experiment showed some of the shortcomings
   of an integrated pest management system for stored grain, based on
   cooling, storage at 15\% m.c. and monitoring of pest numbers.  These
   were surface populations of mites in the first winter, spring surface
   re-occurrence of O. surinamensis and surface populations of S. granarius
   in the second winter.  These were overcome by adding surface admixture
   to the other elements of the IPM system.  The IPM programme cost less
   than half of the cost of admixing the bulk with the cheapest insecticide
   and used 10\% of the insecticide.}},

   concolor) population during 1979-87 to document the dynamics of this
   unhunted population and to test the hypothesis that cougars would
   regulate their density at a level below that set by prey abundance alone
   (Seidensticker et al. 1973).  We captured cougars when detected during
   ongoing searches for sign in the study area.  Resident adult cougar
   density remained relatively constant (0.37/100 km2) for the first 7
   years but increased slightly in the last 2 years.  Mule deer (Odocoileus
   hemionus), the cougar's primary prey, increased over the 9 years, but
   magnitude of this increase was unknown.  Results supported the
   hypothesis that cougar density is set by environmental features other
   than prey abundance alone.  Adult resident females bred as young as 17
   months and produced litters that averaged 2.4 kittens at an interval of
   24.3 months.}},

Abstract = {{Two 30 d long static toxicity tests were performed on small spat (2 to 3
   mm in length) of the estuarine bivalve Scrobicularia plana (da Costa):
   the effects of tributylin (TBT) and copper on the survival and burying
   activity in sand of juveniles were monitored in 1991, and growth and
   burying activity as affected by TBT were investigated on a sample of a
   different cohort in 1992. Results showed that an LC50 (concentration
   killing 50\% of the population considered) could be set for TBT at < 1.3
   mug Sn l-1 (as analysed), while exposure to up to 80 mug Cu l-1 did not
   result in increased mortalities with respect to the controls. Every dose
   of TBT tested in 1991 (nominal 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mug Sn l-1) impaired the
   burying activity of spat significantly from Day 6, and Cu concentrations
   at 20 mug l-1 and above also increased the burying time of juveniles by
   the end of the experiment; the no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC)
   for Cu was the lowest dose tested (i.e. 10 mug l-1). In 1992 the effect
   of 4 lower TBT concentrations (nominal 50, 125, 250 and 500 ng Sn l-1)
   on the juvenile burying activity was somewhat inconsistent; however,
   burying time of individuals exposed to 500 ng Sn l-1 was always higher
   than that estimated to be characteristic of spat at initiation of the
   test. In addition, juvenile growth (weight gain) was significantly
   reduced by all TBT concentrations (i.e. lowest range of 12 to 43 ng Sn
   l-1, as analysed). It is concluded that TBT has probably caused the
   disappearance of some S. plana populations in the UK; similarly,
   organotin may have also caused the decline in S. plana abundance in
   populations from elsewhere in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{In the Gullmarsfjord, on the west coast of Sweden, a variety of morphs
   of Metridium senile (L.) are found. A small form (pedal disc diameter
   0.3 cm) is found in dense clones (90\% coverage) in high-flow habitats
   at 2 to 5 m depth, and larger forms (pedal disc diameter = 2.5 to 3.5
   cm) are found abundantly in subtidal low-flow habitats where body size
   increases with depth. In order to investigate the adaptive significance
   of body size and laceration in M. senile from different current regimes,
   individuals of a large and small morph were reciprocally transplanted
   between a low-flow (< 5 cm s-1) and a high-flow (> 65 cm s-1) subtidal
   habitat, and incidents of pedal laceration were monitored from August
   1992 to January 1993. For comparison, 2 experiments (analogous to the
   field transplants) were carried out in laboratory flumes. The relative
   importance of sexual reproduction in the 2 habitats was investigated by
   comparing gonad sizes of mature females. The results of field and
   laboratory experiments showed that individuals from the high-flow
   habitat decreased their rate of laceration in low flow, but maintained a
   higher rate of pedal laceration than the low-flow population
   irrespective of site of transplantation, suggesting that properties of
   asexual proliferation possess both habitat-related and intrinsic
   components. Sexual reproductive allocation was positively correlated
   with body size and was significantly greater among females from the
   low-flow population. When adjusted for a common body weight, however,
   differences in gonad sizes were insignificant. Frequent asexual
   replication of the genet and fertility at a small size (1 g) are argued
   to be important features in the high-flow habitat which compensate for
   the reduced reproductive output of individual anemones and eventually
   maximize clonal fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Four sampling methods were compared to determine their practicality and
   suitability for detecting population fluctuations of adult Drosophila
   repleta, a pest in caged-layer poultry houses. Five caged-layer poultry
   houses with gutter-flush manure removal systems in Franklin County,
   North Carolina, U.S.A., were sampled once every 2 weeks over 15 months,
   from June 1991 to August 1992. The flies were most abundant during the
   spring and early summer. Visual counts of adult flies resting on the
   feed troughs in front of cages in the aisles and counts of flies caught
   on a sticky ribbon lowered into the gutter used for manure removal by
   flushing were more satisfactory sampling methods than using counts of
   flies caught on sticky ribbons carried along the aisles or aspirator
   collections from the gutters. For the visual count method, the effects
   of location in the house, within each aisle, and feed trough height were
   determined; two counts on feed troughs in each of two inside rows of
   cages were sufficient to measure population changes. For routine
   monitoring of D. repleta populations, visual counts of flies resting on
   the feed troughs in the front area of two aisles and catching flies on
   sticky ribbons inserted into the rear gutter area are recommended}},

Abstract = {{Humans are exposed to numerous environmental agents that can increase
   the probability of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Most of
   environmental exposures involve concurrent or sequential exposure to
   several agents in air, water, and food. Interactive effects in
   carcinogenesis have been described for a certain number of combinations
   of agents. They are described in terms of enhancement or inhibition of
   carcinogenesis. Risk assessment of exposure to environmental agents can
   start either from laboratory studies after exposure to different agents
   or from epidemiological studies in relation to actual exposure. The use
   of genotoxicity testing is essential for assessment of potential human
   toxicity so that hazards can be prevented. Cytogenetic monitoring of
   human populations exposed to environmental agents has proved to be a
   useful tool for detecting their mutagenic effects. Cytogenetic analysis
   of human chromosomes in peripheral lymphocytes allows direct detection
   of mutation in somatic cells. Various methods can be used for
   chromosomal analysis (conventional chromosomal analysis, sister
   chromatid exchange, micronucleus frequency detection). Micronucleus
   frequency can be detected either in peripheral blood lymphocytes or in
   exfoliated cells. Different examples of human population studies are
   presented in this review. Several problems which are found in
   biomonitoring studies are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have compared mutant frequency data at the hprt locus
   in circulating T-lymphocytes from four large datasets obtained in the UK
   (Sussex), the USA (Vermont), France (Paris) and The Netherlands
   (Leiden). In total, data from > 500 non-exposed individuals ranging in
   age from newborns (cord blood samples) to > 80 years old have been
   included in the analysis. Based on raw data provided by the four
   laboratories, a model is presented for the analysis of mutant frequency
   estimations for population monitoring. For three of the laboratories, a
   considerable body of data was provided on replicate estimates of mutant
   frequency from single blood samples, as well as estimates from repeat
   blood samples obtained over a period of time from many of the individual
   subjects. This enabled us to analyse the sources of variation in the
   estimation of mutant frequency. Although some variation was apparent in
   the results from the four laboratories, overall the data were in general
   agreement. Thus, in all laboratories, cellular cloning efficiency of
   T-cells was generally high(> 30\%), although in each laboratory
   considerable variation between experiments and subjects was seen. Mutant
   frequency per clonable T-cell was in general found to be inversely
   related to cloning efficiency. With the exception of a few outliers
   (which are to be expected), mutant frequencies at this locus were in the
   same range in each dataset; no effect of subject gender was found, but
   an overall clear age effect was apparent. When log mutant frequency was
   analysed vs log (age + 0.5) a consistent trend from birth to old age was
   seen. In contrast, the effect of the smoking habit did differ between
   the laboratories, there being an association of smoking with a
   significant increase in mutant frequency in the Sussex and Leiden
   datasets, but not in those from the Vermont or Paris datasets. Possible
   reasons for this are discussed. One of the objectives of population
   monitoring is an ability to detect the effect of accidental or
   environmental exposure to mutagens and carcinogens among exposed
   persons. The large body of data from non-exposed subjects we have
   analysed in this paper has enabled us to estimate the size of an effect
   that could be detected, and the number of individuals required to detect
   a significant effect, taking known sources of variation into account. We
   now suggest that, given the variation between subjects that is seen,
   large sample sizes (30-50 subjects per subject category) may be required
   to have a 90\% chance of detecting increases 1.5-fold above the control
   level, while rather smaller samples (similar to 20 per group) would be
   required to detect a 2-fold increase.}},

Abstract = {{Frequencies of HPRT mutants (MFs), chromosomal aberrations with or
   without gaps (CA +; CA -), aberrant cells (AC), micronuclei (MN),
   sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cells with high frequencies of
   SCEs (HFCs) were measured in lymphocytes collected from 46 workers
   occupationally exposed to styrene and dichloromethane (DCM = methylene
   chloride). These parameters were also determined in 23 controls.
   Time-weighted average (TWA) values for styrene and DCM exposure during
   an 8-h working day were respectively 70 mg/m(3) (range: 0-598) and 108
   mg/m(3) (range: 0-742). These values correspond to TWA values of 17 ppm
   styrene and 31 ppm DCM. In exposed workers, ah cytogenetic parameters
   were significantly enhanced (P < 0.0001; one-sided), but, due to the
   lack of appropriate control data, no definite conclusions could be drawn
   concerning the mutagenicity of styrene/DCM exposure. Duration of
   exposure was not correlated with genetic effects analyzed. The TWA value
   for styrene was not correlated with the extent of genetic damage
   detected, but the TWA value for DCM was positively correlated with the
   frequencies of chromosome aberrations (with gaps) and aberrant cells.
   These observations make it difficult to decide whether styrene or DCM,
   or both chemicals, induced the cytogenetic effects observed in exposed
   workers. Using the present styrene/DCM data, earlier ethylene oxide data
   and unpublished epichlorohydrin data, the relative sensitivity of the
   genetic endpoints to detect genotoxic exposure was: HFC > CA - > CA + >
   SCE > MN > HPRT.}},

Abstract = {{A human monitoring study was carried out to explore the effect on
   lymphocyte proliferation of chronic exposure to arsenic (As) via
   drinking water. Blood and urine samples were taken from volunteers from
   a town where levels of As in the drinking water averaged 412 mu g/l, and
   from a matched group of individuals, with similar socioeconomic status,
   that drank water with As average levels of 37.2 mu g/l. Exposure was
   assessed by questionnaires and by determining the levels of As in urine
   and water samples. The evaluation of the peripheral blood lymphocyte
   proliferation was done at different culture times using labelling (LI),
   mitotic (MI) and replication indexes (RI) as endpoints. No significant
   differences were seen for either LI or MI, except for MI in 72 h
   cultures and in LI in males and females with skin lesions vs. those
   without lesions. Significant differences in RI were seen for exposed
   females but not for males. Correlations between LI and MI showed that
   progression from the initial S- to M-phase is altered in exposed
   individuals. Arsenic exposure as well as lead and mercury affect
   cellular immune response, making the endpoints of cell proliferation
   variables of interest in population monitoring study design, since they
   might provide information in health impairment due to exposure, which is

Abstract = {{Primula alcalina (alkali primrose), a small perennial plant, is a
   candidate for federal listing as a threatened species.  It occurs along
   creeks and seeps in three drainages in east-central Idaho, on sites that
   differ in grazing regime.  Grazing ranges from heavy use by livestock
   throughout the growing season to protection from livestock grazing since
   1975.  All major populations of the species appeared vigorous in 1991,
   consisting of large numbers of reproductive plants.  We tentatively
   conclude that livestock grazing may be injurious to this species when it
   occurs between the time of anthesis and seed dispersal (numbers of
   seedlings, plants with mature fruits, or both were usually low on sites
   grazed during this time).  However, some removal of overtopping
   vegetation and creation of bare ground by grazers may be beneficial, in
   that numbers of seedlings and reproductive plants were relatively low on
   most sites that were grazed lightly or during winter only.  There was no
   clear effect of grazing on numbers of mature plants, suggesting that
   potential adverse effects of grazing may be counterbalanced by potential
   benefits of grazing.  Monitoring of populations and grazing is being
   continued to determine whether there are trends in population status and
   relationships to grazing.  Primary axes of variation in community
   composition (as revealed by ordination) were related to topography and
   moisture, and P. alcalina cover was often greater on hummocks in
   standing water than on drier hummocks and benches.  Other P. alcalina
   demographic parameters were not correlated with vegetation gradients,
   suggesting that the species is capable of persisting throughout the
   range of sampled sites and that demographic parameters vary in response
   to factors other than those influencing overall community composition.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring selected populations of the only two native Antarctic
   vascular plant species (Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia
   antarctica) over a 27-year period has revealed a significant and
   relatively rapid increase in numbers of individuals and populations at
   two widely separated localities in the maritime Antarctic. There is
   strong evidence that this increase is a response to a warming trend in
   summer air temperatures, which has been evident throughout the region
   since the late 1940s, enhancing seed maturation, germination and
   seedling survival. This study provides the only known long term
   monitoring data for any terrestrial organisms in Antarc-tica. Because
   their response to ameliorating conditions is more rapid than that of the
   dominant crypt ogamic groups, Antarctic phanerogams may be useful
   bioindicators of climate change in West Antarctica.}},

Abstract = {{study of the ecology and epidemiology of kiwifruit blossom blight,
   believed to be caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas viridiflava, was made
   at the Horticulture and Food Research Institute's Kumeu Research Orchard
   during spring 1991. Populations of Pseudomonas species, progression of
   disease symptoms, and micrometeorological conditions were monitored
   during flowering. No correlations were found between disease progress
   and the climate variables measured. The rate of increase in disease
   incidence changed with the transition of buds to flowers. Changes in the
   rate of increase, legit transformed, were compared with climate
   variables using cross-correlation. Populations of P. viridiflava were
   related to the number of diseased blossoms remaining on the vine. The
   population of a saprophytic bacterium, P. fluorescens, increased as
   flowering progressed and as dead flower parts became available for
   colonization. Other Pseudomonas species were only present in low
   numbers. The population of P. viridiflava and the rate of disease
   progress decreased at fruit set. A comparison of simulated disease
   progress curves (calculated using disease model formulae) with disease
   progress curves from real data suggested that the epidemic was
   polycyclic, and observations suggested that disease was spreading to
   unopened buds.}},

Abstract = {{Isogenic diploid and tetraploid alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) was studied
   with molecular markers to help understand why diploid performance and
   breeding behavior does not always predict that of tetraploids. In a
   previous study of partially heterozygous alfalfa genotypes, we detected
   a low correlation between yields of isogenic diploid (2x) and tetraploid
   (4x) single-cross progenies, and genetic distances were more highly
   correlated with yields of tetraploids than diploids. These differences
   may be related to the level of RFLP heterozygosity expected among
   progenies derived from heterozygous parents at the two ploidy levels.
   The objectives of this study were to determine the relationships among
   genetic distance, forage yield and heterozygosity in isogenic 2x and 4x
   alfalfa populations. Four diploid genotypes were chromosome doubled to
   produce corresponding isogenic autotetraploids, and these genotypes were
   mated in 4 x 4 diallels to produce 6 single-cross families at each
   ploidy level for field evaluation. Allele compositions of parents were
   determined at 33 RFLP loci by monitoring segregation of homologous
   restriction fragments among individuals within progenies, and these were
   used to estimate RFLP heterozygosity levels for all single-cross
   progenies at both ploidy levels. RFLP heterozygosity rankings were
   identical between progenies of isogenic diploid and tetraploid parents;
   but significant associations (P< 0.05) between estimated heterozygosity
   levels and forage yield were detected only at the tetraploid level.
   Since tetraploid families were nearly 25\% more heterozygous than the
   corresponding diploid families, inconsistencies in the association
   between molecular marker diversity and forage yields of isogenic 2x and
   4x single crosses may be due to recessive alleles that are expressed in
   diploids but masked in tetraploids. The gene action involved in
   heterosis may be the same at both ploidy levels; however, tetraploids
   benefit from greater complementary gene interactions than are possible
   for equivalent diploids.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi colonising leaf 3,
   the flag leaf and the ears of spring wheat were analysed over two
   complete growing seasons in both the glasshouse and field in 1990 and
   the field only in 1991. Bacterial isolates were identified by analysis
   of their fatty acid methyl-ester (FAME) profiles and a total of 37
   genera and 88 species was identified. Of the 15 bacteria most frequently
   recovered and identified, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Microbacterium
   lacticum, Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Pseudomonas
   fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida and Serratia plymuthica occurred in both
   years in the glasshouse and field but only Pseudomonas aureofaciens
   occurred at a similar frequency in all three experimental series.
   Several plant pathogenic species were identified. By dilution plating,
   12 genera of fungi were identified with Aureobasidium, Cladosporium,
   pink and white yeasts being the most common, occurring at 80\% or more
   of the sampling times and sites. Populations of the major groups of
   microbes (pink and white yeasts, filamentous fungi and bacteria)
   generally increased in size with time on all tissues sampled in both
   glasshouse and field, despite plants growing faster in the glasshouse
   than the field. However, microbial populations were generally
   significantly larger on field grown plants than on glasshouse grown
   ones.
   The value of using FAME profiles to quantify bacterial populations in
   environmental samples is considered. The significance of the results in
   relation to monitoring the impact of a future introduction of a
   genetically modified microorganism (GMM) into the phyllosphere of wheat
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Pine bark extracts and pine bark powders were evaluated in vitro and in
   greenhouse experiments for effect on fungal growth and infectivity, soil
   enzyme activity and soil microbial populations. Agar media were
   formulated using powdered fresh or composted pine bark and pine bark
   extracts prepared by refluxing pine bar powder with acid, neutral, and
   alkaline solutions Growth of Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotium rolfsii,
   Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum, Phytophthora parasitica,
   Alternaria solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was reduced on agar
   containing either fresh or composted pine bark powder, whereas growth of
   the nonparasitic fungus Penicillium citrinum was enhanced. Growth of
   parasitic fungi on media containing pine bark extracts was varied.
   However, extracts prepared using alkaline solutions reduced the growth
   of more of the fungi tested and to a greater extent than extracts
   prepared with neutral or acid solutions. In greenhouse experiments,
   emergence of lentil (Lens culinaris) was significantly increased by the
   addition of fresh or composted pine bark powder to soil inoculated with
   either R. solani or S. rolfsii. Increases in soil trehalase activity
   were correlated with increases in total populations of indigenous fungi
   and specifically with species of Penicillium and Paecilomyces. Pine bark
   powder decreased fungal growth in vitro and reduced disease incidence in
   greenhouse experiments while altering soil fungal populations. Analysis
   of soil trehalase activity provides a simplified means for monitoring
   soil fungal populations leading to a more complete understanding of soil
   microbial ecology. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense Scop.) was grown, for one to three
   seasons, together with tall fescue, Festuca arundinaceae Schreb., and
   crownvetch, Coronilla varia L., the latter two seeded at four densities,
   in the presence of a thistle defoliator, Cassida rubiginosa Muller
   (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), before the resultant vegetation was
   evaluated. Cassida rubiginosa was monitored and maintained at densities
   of at least 50 beetles per square meter. This population level of C.
   rubiginosa enhanced the impact of the plant competitors as insect
   defoliation inhibited the ability of the thistle to compete against
   other vegetation. Biomass of Canada thistle decreased with increase in
   the density of the plant competitors seeded. Reduction of biomass of
   Canada thistle was greatest when the induced competitors were seeded
   between 1.2 and 1.25 times the recommended rate of 20 kg/ha of
   crownvetch and 50 kg/ha of tall fescue. In terms of dry aerial thistle
   weight, there was a mean reduction of 69.2 +/- 13.8\% for the duration
   of competition. At lower or higher densities, induced competition was
   less efficient at suppressing the thistle. Overall, biomass of Canada
   thistle was highest after two seasons, but decreased subsequently.
   Fescue established more rapidly than crown vetch and was the main
   competitor of Canada thistle initially. Crownvetch had very little
   growth in the first season. When seeded up to 1.25 times the recommended
   rate, it increased in biomass by the third season. Biomass of other
   dicots showed no response to the density of induced competition within
   one or two seasons of growth, but by the end of the third season, log
   dry weight of all other dicots decreased proportionally with increased
   density of induced competition. Results of this study indicate that
   plant competition and biological control can be combined to suppress
   Canada thistle, and C. rubiginosa as well as induced competition can be
   an integral part of a comprehensive approach for area-wide Canada
   thistle control. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{An Australia-wide taxonomic survey for species of the potentially toxic
   diatom genus Pseudonitzchia Peragallo (causative organisms of amnesic
   shellfish poisoning) was carried out using both light and transmission
   electron microscopy.  Samples studied derived from the Gulf of
   Carpentaria, North West Shelf, Coral Sea, East Australian Current,
   Tasmanian, Victorian and Western Australian coastal waters.  The
   dominant bloom-forming Pseudonitzchia species in Australian coastal
   waters were P. fraudulenta (New South Wales), P. pungens f. pungens and
   P. pseudodelicatissima (Tasmanian and Victorian waters).  Other
   representatives of this diatom genus in Australian waters include P.
   americana, P. lineola, P. subpacifica and P. turgidula, but these were
   usually only present in low concentrations.
   While populations of P. pseudodelicatissima from the Bay of Fundy
   (Canada) can be weakly toxic, wild and cultured diatom populations of
   this species from Tasmanian and Victorian coastal waters were
   consistently nontoxic.  The major toxic Pseudonitzschia species of
   concern in Canadian waters, P. pungens f. multiseries was detected as a
   minor component (5\% of total biomass) of a dense P. pungens f. pungens
   bloom in a New South Wales estuary.  Pseudonitzchia australis, a toxic
   species in Californian waters, was never detected in Australian waters. 
   Surveys to identify bloom-forming Pseudonitzschia species in Australian
   waters, and monitoring of these species for toxicity, will continue.}},

Abstract = {{The number of wind-borne female Simulium damnosum Theobald sensu lato
   migrating across territory devoid of breeding populations (the

   separated sites downwind.  The seasonal curves of numbers recorded each
   day were remarkably similar in pattern at each site with little blurring
   (although numbers lessened as distance from source increased).  The
   uniformity suggests that each daily batch of S. damnosum moved downwind
   en bloc with but a small proportion of laggards.  To test this
   hypothesis, model curves were generated, with different proportions of
   daily laggards, from the data at each sampling site and compared by
   chi-squared tests with the observed curve at the next site downwind.  It
   was found that, in general, those models that most closely resembled the
   downwind curves were those with the smallest proportion of laggards. 
   Other aspects of the migration were also considered, notably the factors
   affecting loss of numbers as distance increased and the interaction
   between laggards and loss where it was shown that the greater the
   proportion of laggards the greater will be the daily loss.}},

Abstract = {{A fishing survey was carried out over four years (1988-1991) using a
   trammel net as a sampling device at reef and unprotected control sites
   about 2.5 miles apart located along the central Adriatic coast on a
   sandy-mud bottom (depth 10-11 m). At the same time, qualitative visual
   observations were carried out by scuba divers at the reef to obtain
   information independent of catch samples. Objectives were to evaluate
   the effectiveness of the sample gear as a descriptor of the reef
   community, to test the effectiveness of the artificial reef to enhance
   fish assemblage and yield and to evaluate these effects seasonally.
   Seasonal fluctuations in fish abundance were confirmed by visual
   observations at both sites. Lowest values were recorded in winter, when
   most of the species migrated to deeper and warmer waters. In spite of
   this, the average total yield was 10.9 kg.year(-1) at the artificial
   reef, compared to 8.1 kg.year(-1) at the control site and the difference
   was statistically significant. During the fishing survey the fish
   reported from the reef always exceeded in average weight those obtained
   from the control site. The influence of the reef was particularly
   apparent for nekto-benthic fish. In fact pelagic fish always dominated
   the fish catches at the control site. The same was true at the reef
   during the first two survey years. After that the nekto-benthic fish,
   mainly represented by partially and/or obligatory reef-dwelling species,
   such as sparids and sciaenids, gradually increased and reached the same
   importance as the pelagics. Conversely, no significant differences were
   recorded for molluscs and crustaceans between the two sites. Higher
   total species richness (S-t) mean species richness (S-m) and species
   diversity (H') were recorded at the artificial reef in comparison with
   the control sire. The difference was statistically significant for S-m
   and not significant for H'. Differences in the fish species composition
   were also recorded between fishing samplings and visual observations at
   the reef. Fewer species of fish, crustaceans and molluscs were recorded
   by visual observations than by trammel net. This last method better
   described the population of the original sandy-muddy bottom. Conversely
   the partially and obligatory reef-dwelling species were better recorded
   visually.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty standard concrete modules were deployed on a sand bottom to make
   16 replicated artificial reefs of 1 to 8 modules.reef(-1). Fish
   assemblages were monitored for species composition, abundance, and fish
   size, and compared to two natural control sites. We censused 127 species
   (107,168 fishes) from artificial reefs, 93 species (16,495 fishes) on
   natural control reefs, and 17 species (1,040 fishes) on sand bottom from
   July 1987 to March 1989. Artificial reefs supported a diverse, abundant,
   and dynamic assemblage of fishes that were a mixture of species found in
   surrounding sand and natural reef habitats. Colonization (number of
   species, individuals, and biomass) was very rapid. Abundance varied
   seasonally with recruitment episodes tending to occur in the spring and
   summer followed by losses for the remainder of the year. Assemblages
   were quite variable on and between similar sized reefs. Fish and biomass
   densities were higher at artificial reefs than on sand and natural
   reefs. Resident fish biomass varied less than resident fish numbers,
   because individual growth compensated for mortality after recruitment
   episodes. Reef size significantly influenced total numbers of species,
   individuals, and biomass. Smaller reefs had greater fish density while
   larger reefs had higher biomass density from larger but fewer,
   individuals. Multiple small reefs supported more individuals and more
   species than one large reef of equal material. Fishes recruited by
   larval settlement accounted far 36\% of the total resident abundance but
   only 2\% of total biomass. As reef size increased, older juvenile or
   adult colonists comprised a greater percentage of total biomass (94\% to
   99\%). Assemblage importance percentages (based on abundance, biomass,
   and frequency) were divided between residents (64\%), visitors (20\%),
   and transients (16\%). Economically important species comprised 61\% of
   the biomass and 55\% of the individuals, among which settlers accounted
   for 94.3\% of individuals but only 5.7\% of their total biomass. The
   most highly valued species were visitors or residents that utilized the
   reefs after first settling elsewhere. These results showed that data on
   artificial reef assemblages based solely on the abundance of resident
   species are biased. Data on visitors, transients,
   frequency-of-occurrence, and biomass are important in evaluating bias.
   Results provided a partial test and support for a model predicting the
   importance of attraction over production for artificial reefs located in
   areas with high reef availability.}},

Abstract = {{The colonization of an experimental reef composed of blocks of
   stabilized coal-fired power station waste (pulverized fuel ash (PFA) and
   gypsum), which was installed in Poole Bay in June 1989 is described. The
   reef consists of 50 tons of blocks (each 40 x 20 x 20 cm) formed into
   eight conical units, each 1 m high by 4 m across on an area of seabed 30
   m x 10 m. The reef lies on a fiat sandy seabed (10 m below chart datum)
   3 km distant from natural rocky outcrops. The eight units represent
   three different PFA/gypsum mixes, each replicated, and two concrete
   controls. Colonization by epibiota was monitored using direct
   observation and photographic recording of block surfaces. Analysis of
   the results using CLUSTAN 3/PC clustering software did not reveal any
   differences in the biota colonizing the three PFA/gypsum mixes or
   between the colonizers of the PFA/gypsum mixes and the concrete
   controls. Epibiota showed seasonal variations in abundance throughout
   the year overlain with a progression in the numbers of species present
   and a maturation of the population towards the epibiotic populations
   seen on local natural reefs. Adult lobsters (Homarus gammarus) and crabs
   (Cancer pagurus) from the local natural reefs were recruited to the reef
   within 3 weeks. Acoustic and conventional tagging studies revealed that
   some lobsters showed considerable site loyalty, with recorded residence
   time of 368 days. The most numerous shoaling fish congregating around
   the reef units has been the pouting, Trisopterus luscus, a small gadoid.
   Shoal size was commonly estimated at around 200 individuals per reef
   unit. Summer biomass estimates of pouting wet weight, using published
   weight to length conversions, were 207-1572 kg.ha(-1) in the vicinity of
   any one of the eight reef units. Several species using the reef were
   observed to be reproducing there. These include corkwing wrasse
   (Crenilabrus melops), lobster (Homarus gammarus), spiny spider crabs
   (Maja squinado), velvet swimming crab (Liocarcinus puber), hermit crabs
   (Pagurus bernhardus), whelks (Buccinum undatum) and the nudibranch
   (Archidoris pseudoargus). Assessment of infauna suggests that the
   infaunal population in the vicinity of the reef was not overtly affected
   by the presence of the reef. Sediment granulometry did not alter
   significantly between May 1989 and July 1991.}},

Abstract = {{We summarized hunter visits, success, and the magnitude and
   species-subspecies composition of the goose harvest recorded on
   California public hunting areas (PHAs) during 1950-89. Of six geographic
   regions, the Northeast accounted for the largest portion of the PHA
   harvest (55\%); most of the remainder occurred in the Sacramento (30\%)
   and Imperial (10\%) Valley regions. Harvest, hunter visits, and success
   were low during the 1950s, but increased during the 1960s as new PHAs
   were added and data from Tule Lake and Lower Klamath National Wildlife
   Refuges (NWRs), where about half of California's PHA goose harvest
   occurs, became available. Success and harvest reflected declining goose
   abundance during the 1970s; however, hunter visits remained high on most
   PHAs because ducks were abundant. During the 1980s, declining
   populations of greater white-fronted geese, Anser albifrons frontalis,
   and cackling Canada geese, Branta canadensis minima, prompted
   restrictive regulations resulting in low harvest and success. Hunter
   visits were further reduced because of declining duck abundance and
   overall declines in hunter numbers. White-fronted geese were most
   prominent in the Northeast and Suisun Marsh harvest, but the lesser snow
   goose, Chen caerolescens caerulescens, was more important in other
   regions. Overall, the cackling Canada goose was the third most common
   goose harvested. The harvest of most geese peaked during 1965-74,
   coinciding with a peak in hunter visits, and then declined. However, the
   harvest of Canada geese (includes unknown proportions of western, B. c.
   moffitfi, Taverner's, B. c. taverneri, and lesser, B. c. parvipes) and
   Ross' geese, Chen rossi, increased slightly throughout the study period.
   PHA harvest averaged 9-15\% of the total state goose harvest during
   1960-89. Success on PHAs was greater than statewide success until the
   1980's, when restrictive regulations were imposed in zones encompassing
   many Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Basin PHAs. White-fronted geese
   comprised a larger portion of the PHA bag than state-wide, and their
   decline reduced hunting opportunity for PHA hunters. The status of
   Pacific Flyway geese has improved in recent years, but intensive
   population management and monitoring should continue.}},

   Adelges abietis (L.) (Homoptera: Adelgidae), on young white spruce,
   Picea glauca (Moench) Voss., was studied at three sites in New
   Brunswick, Canada. Within a branch, the majority of galls were found on
   lateral shoots. Similar distributions of galls within trees were
   observed regardless of whether 20 or 30 lateral shoots or all shoots on
   a branch were sampled. Gall densities were highest on mid-crown branches
   of open-grown trees 1-4 m tall and were not influenced by cardinal
   direction. After crown closure, most galls were found in the upper
   crown, above the point of branch overlap. In all circumstances, gall
   distributions were strongly clumped within trees. Inter-tree
   distribution of A. abietis galls differed significantly from a Poisson
   but not a negative binomial distribution, indicating a high degree of
   aggregation among trees. Therefore, a stratified random sampling plan
   using 20 lateral shoots of a mid-crown branch as a sampling unit would
   be adequate for monitoring A. abietis populations. If the mid-crown
   branches are undergoing crown closure, we suggest sampling in the lowest
   open-grown branch above the point of crown overlap.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous behavioral hypotheses have been suggested to explain population
   cycles in microtine rodents. Charnov and Finerty (1980) proposed that
   preferential behavior toward relatives drives population cycles through
   kin selection. Their hypothesis makes three assumptions: (1) individuals
   behaviorally discriminate kin from non-kin, (2) kin associate, and (3)
   kin benefit from this association. These assumptions were tested in
   female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) in eastern Kansas. An equal
   number of laboratory-born females and males were released into 12 fenced
   enclosures; 6 enclosures contained groups of littermate sisters and 6
   contained groups of unrelated females. Space use, reproductive success,
   and survival were monitored during two replications of the experiment
   (Fall 1989 and Spring 1990). Female survival and reproductive success
   were not affected by relatedness, although more young were born in the
   Spring than in the Fall. Home range size and overlap were greater for
   females in related groups than those in unrelated groups. Home range
   size also was larger in the Fall than in the Spring. Prairie vole
   sisters associated spatially, but our measurements showed no fitness
   benefits conferred by these associations. Although the kin-selection
   hypothesis could not be demonstrated in this experimental population,
   relatedness in local neighborhoods may have consequences for small
   mammal population ecology.}},

Abstract = {{I monitored natural nests of an Illinois population of the western
   painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii), a species with
   temperature-dependent sex determination, for 4 yr to investigate the
   relationships between vegetational cover at the nest site and hatchling
   sex ratio.
   Most nests produced hatchlings all of one sex (66\% of 116 nests).
   Hatchling sex ratio within nests was predictably related to the nesting
   beach and to the quantity of solar exposure at the nest mainly from the
   south. The North beach tended to produce more all-male nests and an
   overall male-biased sex ratio than did the South beach. Within each
   beach, nests with more vegetational cover on the southern and perhaps
   western aspects produced more males than did more exposed nests.
   However, the relationship between solar exposure and nest sex ratio was
   absent during two atypically cool summers.
   This study suggests a possible mechanism by which female turtles choose
   the thermal environment of nests and, hence, the sex ratio of their
   offspring: they may assess vegetational cover on the nest site at
   oviposition.}},

Abstract = {{In order to meet a growing need to determine the condition of the
   nation's ecosystems and how their condition is changing, the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed EMAP, the Environmental
   Monitoring and Assessment Program. A common survey design serves as the
   foundation on which to base monitoring of status and trends among
   diverse ecosystem types. In this paper, we describe the need for a
   statistically based survey design, briefly summarize the basic EMAP
   design, describe how that design is tailored for the selection of a
   probability sample of lakes on which to make measurements of lake
   condition, and illustrate the process for selecting a sample of lakes in
   the northeastern United States. Finally, we illustrate how measurements
   taken on the sample of lakes can be summarized, with known uncertainty,
   to describe the condition of a population of lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Land use activities may affect surface water quantity and quality. Water
   quality changes (concentration increases) from land use activities that
   are above background but below the water quality standard or criteria
   have always been considered benign. Increased public interest and recent
   legislation and management regarding threatened, or endangered, salmon
   populations suggest that environmental influences on these populations
   need to be reevaluated.
   As one approach, we developed a risk assessment (toxicity and exposure)
   for salmon from water quality changes following timber harvesting.
   Toxicity relationships for nitrate-nitrogen (as an LC(50)) using
   chloride, suspended sediment, and exposure were developed from the
   literature and data from the Alsea Watershed Study in the Oregon Coast
   Range. These relationships were used to predict the probable risk to
   coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to nitrate-nitrogen exposure.
   The control or reference catchment, Flynn Creek, had higher
   nitrate-nitrogen concentrations, but showed little likelihood of risk to
   salmon because of lower suspended sediment concentrations. The treated
   catchment, Needle Branch (harvested 27 years ago), had lower
   nitrate-nitrogen concentrations and was expected to have less risk to
   salmon. However, the risk assessment relationship exhibited sensitivity
   to suspended sediment concentrations. This smaller catchment had higher
   suspended sediment transport and thus a higher risk of nitrate-nitrogen
   exposure to salmon. The suspended sediment transport functions were
   based on post-treatment monitoring (1966-1973) and are not considered to
   represent the current situation. These findings are not meant to be
   categorical, but merely illustrative of this risk assessment
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Induction of the hepatic detoxification enzyme cytochrome P4501A has
   been observed in fish exposed to bleached-kraft mill effluents (BKME).
   P4501 A content was examined in three species of wild fish exposed to
   BKME in a western Canadian river as part of an extensive program that
   included chemical monitoring, fish population studies, and other fish
   biochemical and physiological measurements. The Rocky Mountain whitefish
   Prosopium williamsoni exhibited marked induction of P4501 A compared to
   reference whitefish, as measured by both catalytic activity and
   immunoreactive protein content. Similar P4501 A induction was observed 4
   d after reference fish were treated with 20 mg/kg beta-naphthoflavone.
   Whitefish P4501A levels have declined from a peak in spring 1991,
   following mill process modifications and concurrent with reductions in
   body burdens of hydrophobic compounds. Whitefish collected near the
   mill, moved upstream of effluent discharges, and held for 8 d showed no
   significant loss of hepatic P4501A-related (ethoxyresorufin
   O-deethylase, EROD) enzyme activity or P4501A protein levels. For spring
   1991, correlations were found between EROD activity and measures of
   chronic exposure to BKME (e.g., muscle
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin content), but not between EROD and
   measures of acute exposure (e.g., bile content of resin acids or
   chlorophenolic metabolites). These and other lines of evidence indicate
   that the P4501 A-inducing agent (s) at this site may be neither
   waterborne nor rapidly eliminated. A second species, longnose sucker
   (Calostomus catostomus), collected near the mill exhibited modest (two-
   to threefold) P4501A induction. For both species, no significant
   correlations between P4501A induction and trends in other biological
   responses were found, as described in a companion paper. Burbot (Lota
   lota) had hepatic EROD activities generally in the range of reference
   values, despite substantial exposure to mill-related compounds. In
   contrast to studies at historically degraded pulp mill sites, P4501A
   induction is the only major biological response observed to date at this
   site. As P4501A induction is not related to adverse effects, it could be
   best classified as an indicator of exposure to BKME.}},

Abstract = {{From 1985 through 1990, I monitored the populations of two species of
   toads, Bufo quercicus and B. terrestris, at a temporary pond in the
   xeric uplands of north-central Florida. A drift fence with pitfall traps
   completely encircled the pond basin; the fence was monitored 5 days per
   week throughout the year. The 5-year study coincided with a severe
   regional drought that resulted in generally short hydroperiods at
   unpredictable times of the year More than 800 toads were captured.
   Successful metamorphosis never occurred at the pond although toads
   continued to visit it throughout the study. The sex ratio was male
   biased in B. quercicus but not in B. terrestris, although significant
   variation was observed from one gear to the next. Likewise, the
   size-class structure and length-weight patterns varied among species,
   sexes, and years. Although fewer toads entered the pond basin as the
   study progressed, toads may have gone elsewhere to breed or they may
   have remained in refugia. Thus, decreased capture does not necessarily
   indicate that a drought-related population decline occurred. Drought may
   have disrupted normal arrival patterns and length of slay within the
   pond basin. Drought also could be responsible for variation in annual
   size-class structure of captured toads. The uncertainty of the
   hydroperiod both spatially and temporally in adjacent breeding sites,
   the ability of toads to move long distances with the potential for
   migration between breeding sites, and the lack of specificity in the
   choice of breeding sites (i.e. permanent versus different types of
   temporary wetlands) may lead to the formation of metapopulations in the
   xeric upland habitats of north-central Florida. Long-term monitoring
   under a variety of climatic conditions is needed to assess the effects
   of drought and other types of environmental stresses on toad
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{In South Australia the two tick species Amblyomma limbatum and Aponomma
   hydrosauri share the same common reptile host species, but have
   allopatric distributions which abut along a narrow parapatric boundary. 
   Reproductive interference is a mechanism that has previously been
   suggested could contribute to maintaining the boundary.  Populations of
   each species were established in pens within the range of Aponomma
   hydrosauri.  Pens held either each species alone, or the two species
   together.  The performance of females in those pens was monitored over
   28 months.  There was no indication that the proportion of attached
   females which mated and engorged was reduced by the presence of
   heterospecifics.  There was no indication that the time taken to mate,
   engorge and detach was any longer in the presence of heterospecifics. 
   The experiment did not support the hypothesis that reproductive
   interference contributes to maintaining the parapatric boundary. 
   However, Amblyomma limbatum in the pens had a shorter season of
   reproductive activity, and achieved much smaller numbers of reproductive
   females.  This may inhibit successful colonization of cooler habitats to
   the south of its distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Four different methods for the control of the glasshouse whitefly
   Trialeurodes vaporariorum were tested on cucumber:  traps and
   Quinomethionate (Morestan), Encarsia formosa Gahan and Quinomethionate
   spray, traps followed by parasite release and Applaud combined with
   Actellic.
   All treatments were effective in controlling whitefly populations.  The
   fastest acting treatments were those with traps, the second those with
   Applaud and Acetellic, in which a rapid reduction of the whitefly
   population occurred immediately after spraying.
   Releases of E. formosa after monitoring whitefly populations with traps
   seemed to be very effective; the whitefly populations fluctuated around
   low levels without the necessity for other means of control.
   Quinomethionate gave satisfactory results when combined with traps or
   Encarsia; it did not harm the parasite.  Plots treated with this chemial
   were clean, the plants were healthy and free of red spider mite and
   oidium disease, which were found in other treatments and in the
   controls.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of acute and healed fin erosion in goldfish, Carassius
   auratus (L.), from the Waikato River, New Zealand, peaked in the
   vicinity of a pulp and paper mill which utilized a kraft pulping process
   in association with chlorine bleaching, and decreased down the effluent
   gradient. About 49\% of goldfish sampled from the Kopakorahi Stream,
   which is part of the effluent treatment system (site 1), displayed
   pathological signs of fin erosion, whereas about 9\% of control fish
   from a reference site located upstream of the official effluent
   discharge point were similarly affected. Fin erosion was less prevalent
   in male than in female goldfish, and occurred with different frequencies
   on different fins, the pectoral (56\%) and caudal fins (33\%) being most
   affected. Both the pectoral and caudal fins also had significantly
   higher proportions of healed erosion rather than acute erosion. The
   prevalence of acute and healed fin erosion increased significantly with
   increasing fish Length (age). Physical deformities, predominantly in the
   form of eroded or otherwise malformed opercula, were found in nearly 5\%
   of fish caught at site 1, but were not observed at the reference site.
   Changes in processing and bleaching technology at the pulp and paper
   mill in question have since been carried out, and long-term studies are
   planned to monitor any subsequent improvements in fish health.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted to determine the feasibility of marking
   Dermacentor variabilis (Say) with the alkali metal rubidium (Rb) by
   feeding larvae on mice that were injected with rubidium chloride (RbCl).
   Newly molted nymphs that fed as larvae for 2 to 5 d on RbCl-injected
   mice contained almost-equal-to 660 parts per billion (ppb) of Rb,
   whereas nymphs that had fed for 6 to 10 d as larvae on RbCl-injected
   mice contained 419 ppb of Rb. Nymphs that fed as larvae on control mice
   contained almost-equal-to 9 ppb.  There was no host-specific difference
   in Rb concentration among nymphs obtained from four RbCl-injected mice. 
   Rb-marked nymphs did not show reduced survival as compared with unmarked
   nymphs when survival was monitored for 8 wk.  Rb concentrations in unfed
   nymphs remained close to 600 ppb for 3 wk, then declined to
   almost-equal-to 380 ppb for 5 wk.  Rb concentrations in experimental
   nymphs remained significantly higher than in control nymphs for 8 wk. 
   Adults that molted from Rb-marked nymphs that had fed on control mice
   did not contain elevated levels of Rb.  This marking method has
   considerable potential for aiding in population ecology studies of ticks
   under natural conditions because ticks can be marked via their hosts and
   the mark will be retained for the duration of the life stage without
   passing the mark to subsequent stages.}},

Abstract = {{The application of flow cytometry to the monitoring of phytoplankton is
   demonstrated. A comparison is made with conventional approaches to
   phytoplankton monitoring: light microscopy for the determination of
   species abundance, and chlorophyll a determination and in situ
   chlorophyll a measurement by fluorescence for the determination of the
   biomass. Flow cytometric measurements correlate well with these
   conventional types of measurements, as has been shown by comparing a
   full year of monitoring data obtained at a fixed monitoring location 10
   km off the Dutch coast. Flow cytometry bridges the gap between
   labour-intensive, but highly informative, microscopic observations and
   simple biomass measurements with less information content: via flow
   cytometry optical data are obtained at high speed for individual
   particles, which can be translated into biomass information. On the
   basis of the flow cytometric measurements, rough discrimination of
   phytoplankton species groups is possible, particularly for the abundant
   species. Of crucial importance is careful calibration of the flow
   cytometer, to ensure quantitative and comparable measurements over a
   long period of time. Calibration and quality assurance aspects are
   covered in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1989 and 1993 reproduction was monitored at 96 barn owl (Tyto
   alba) breeding sites in England. Nests were located in tree cavities,
   buildings, and nest boxes in farm buildings and mature trees. Many of
   the sites other than nest boxes used by owls were of human origin, but
   the number of those declined during the course of the study due to
   deterioration of human-made structures and competition from other
   species. Nest boxes increased the population density from 15 breeding
   pairs/100 km2 to 27 pairs. Over the study period, pairs using nest boxes
   produced significantly larger clutches than at other sites, but the
   number of fledglings was not significantly different among types of nest
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Moored plankton nets were used to monitor the supply of settlement-stage
   reef fishes to benthic habitats on Great Bahamas Bank in the vicinity of
   Lee Stocking Island, Exuma Sound, Bahamas. A total of 55 771 fishes,
   representing 53 taxa, were captured in 79 d of sampling from June to
   September 1992. Reef fish larvae were extremely abundant in the samples,
   particularly the families Labridae, Apogonidae, Balistidae, Ophichthidae
   and Scaridae. Almost all fish were taken in night collections, and
   discrete tide sampling suggested most settlement-stage fishes were
   moving onshore during flood tides. Vertical distributions were taxon
   specific, with some taxa concentrated in surface nets while others were
   more abundant in mid-water collections. Larval supply of a number of
   taxa occurred almost entirely during several days around the new moon in
   early July, while other families showed more consistent, although still
   episodic, replenishment patterns. Time series analysis found evidence of
   semi-lunar cycling in the larval supply of scarids and ophichthids,
   lunar cycling in gobiids, bothids and apogonids, and acyclic
   replenishment in clupeids, blennioids, labrids and balistids.
   Crosscorrelations between larval supply and meteorological and
   hydrographic variables found significant associations in the families
   Gobiidae, Apogonidae, Blennioidei and Labridae. Significant correlations
   were driven by a large pulse of replenishment of all these taxa
   coinciding with a relaxation of southeast trade winds. This event
   apparently caused a reversal in the direction of longshore currents and
   generated significant onshore current flow. Settlement-stage larvae may
   have been transported from the northern region of Exuma Sound to Lee
   Stocking Island. Alternatively, larvae may have been entrained from
   offshore waters in the southern Sound and advected across the shelf to
   reef areas.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability, health and biomass yields of marine resources can be
   enhanced by the implementation of a more holistic and ecologically based
   strategy for assessing, monitoring, and managing coastal ecosystems than
   has been generally practiced during most of this century. A major
   milestone was reached in advancing toward a more ecologically based
   management practice when the majority of coastal nations of the world
   endorsed the declaration made at the United Nations Conference on
   Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992, to prevent, reduce, and
   control degradation of the marine environment, so as to maintain and
   improve its life-support and productive capacities; develop and increase
   the potential of marine living resources to meet human nutritional
   needs, as well as social, economic, and development goals; and promote
   the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas
   and the marine environment. The scientific framework in support of the
   UNCED objectives is now emerging from a series of regional efforts aimed
   at cross-sectoral integration of research, monitoring, and assessments
   conducted to mitigate stresses on coastal ecosystems from toxic
   effluents, habitat degradation, nutrient loadings, harmful algal blooms,
   aerosol contaminants, and losses of living resources from pollution and
   overexploitation. Discipline-oriented ecological studies can contribute
   more toward achievement of resource sustainability when they are
   conducted within a framework of science at the level of organization
   that is multidisciplinary and focused on populations, habitats, and
   ecosystems at large spatial scales. Primary, secondary, and tertiary
   driving forces of variability in biomass yields are examined for several
   large marine ecosystems, along with observations on changing states of
   `health' of the systems. Marine resource problems underscored by UNCED
   are being addressed. Post-UNCED large marine ecosystem-scale programs
   for advancement toward resource sustainability, ecosystem health, and
   economically viable biomass yields are now being implemented. The
   programs are being supported by international agencies as part of an
   effort to couple recent advances in ecological monitoring, management,
   and stress mitigation strategies from the more developed countries, with
   the lesser developed coastal countries around the margins of the ocean
   basins.}},

Abstract = {{High tide roost counts have been carried out each spring tide at many
   sites in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea (Germany) since 1987.
   Population indices were calculated for 34 species for each year up to
   autumn 1993. Despite high fluctuations they indicate positive trends for
   16 species and negative trends for 2 species during the short period of
   time considered. A series of mild winters since the beginning of the
   project is discussed as one possible reason for the general increase.
   Although only a part of the Wadden Sea is included in the project yet,
   the value of spring tide counts in monitoring migratory birds in the
   Wadden Sea is obvious.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothezise that the transformation of dead foliar material by
   Diptera larval action represents a modification of food sources and
   microhabitats of microarthropods which can be monitored by observing
   changes in the structure of their communities, and particularly of the
   oribatid mite community. To test this hypothesis, we compared
   experimentally in the field oribatid communities from leaves eaten by
   Bradysia confinis sciarid larvae and from uneaten leaves. The detailed
   analysis at species level, using multivariate methods under linear
   constraints, highlights the species that respond positively and those
   that respond negatively to a substrate modified by larval activity. We
   emphasize the relevance of the multivariate methods to make an accurate
   typology between these species. Of the 21 species censused in the whole
   experiment, 10 show significant response with regard to leaf breakdown
   and allow the construction of a diagrammatic working hypothesis showing
   the phases of colonization and succession of these oribatid species on
   decomposing leaf material in a natural situation. Hermannia gibba,
   Oribatula tibialis and Ceratoppia bipilis appear as interesting species
   for a study of the relations between transformation of leaf material
   during degradation and population development.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the laboratory culture of Verticillium dahliae and the
   harvest, isolation, and manipulation of single microsclerotia (MS) is
   outlined. MS produced in large numbers and stored at several
   temperatures maintained high, uniform viability for 12 mo or more. Thus,
   a single lot of MS could be used in long-term experiments on the effect
   of microbial interaction on MS survival. The MS were harvested from
   semisolid media by wet sieving, mixed with sand to dry without clumping,
   and sorted into size classes by dry sieving. After experimentation,
   single MS were transferred on the tip of a sterile needle into one of 25
   squares marked on an agar plate, and germination and colony growth were
   monitored. The lethal effect of the treatment was reflected by the
   number of dead MS. Sublethal effects could also be measured as a
   reduction in colony growth because larger MS (>75 mu m) exhibited
   faster, more synchronous germination and produced larger colonies than
   smaller MS.}},

Abstract = {{Isolates of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici were obtained from wheat
   leaf collections made by cooperators throughout the United States and
   from cereal rust field surveys of the Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and
   Gulf Coast states in 1992. Fifty-two virulence/avirulence phenotypes
   were found among 728 single uredinial isolates on 14 host lines that are
   near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance. The frequencies of virulence to
   lines with Lr24 and Lr26 during 1992 were greater than in previous
   years. Regional race distribution patterns again suggested that the
   central United States is a single epidemiological unit distinct from the
   eastern United States. The distinctive racial composition of collections
   from the Southeast, Northeast, and Ohio Valley indicate that populations
   of P. r. tritici in those areas are discrete, suggesting epidemics
   originate from localized overwintering sources. Although collections
   from nurseries were not significantly more diverse than collections from
   fields, they did differ substantially in some areas. In the Northeast,
   the racial composition of nursery collections showed little relationship
   to that in field collections.}},

Abstract = {{Three short season cotton production schedules designed to reduce the
   number of overwintering pink bollworms, Pectinophora gossypiella
   (Saunders), in cotton in the Imperial Valley, CA, were tested in each of
   two years to determine their impact on the phenology of sweetpotato
   whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), populations. Yellow sticky card
   traps and cotton leaf samples were used to monitor adult and immature
   stages, respectively. In both years, B. tabaci populations continued to
   increase for up to six weeks after the last cotton irrigation dates.
   Significant reductions in B. tabaci adults and immatures did not occur
   until after the cotton plots were treated with defoliants. Adults
   trapped on yellow sticky traps (13 x 21 cm) placed horizontally 13 cm
   from the soil surface in cotton fields peaked at 5,200 and 12,800 per
   card per week in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Red-eyed nymph stage B.
   tabaci reached densities of nearly ten per one half leaf on sixth and
   twelfth mainstem node leaves in 1986, and 62 per one quarter leaf on
   seventh mainstem node leaves in 1987. A schedule that includes
   irrigation termination by 15 August and defoliation by 1 October to meet
   the mandated 1 November stalk destruction deadline was too late to
   prevent the whitefly population from reaching its peak, and would not
   significantly reduce whitefly dispersal into sensitive crops planted
   before 15 September. To break the population cycle from cotton to these
   later crops, cotton must be last irrigated by 21 July and defoliated by
   20 August, and new vegetable and sugar beet crops must be planted after
   15 September. Since whiteflies continue to emerge from defoliated cotton
   for three weeks after defoliation, this schedule provides a one to two
   week host crop free period. No yield reduction was noted on cotton
   planted by 20 March when following this schedule compared to cotton
   produced with last irrigation and defoliation dates up to four weeks
   later than these dates.}},

Abstract = {{The island spotted skunk and island fox of Santa Cruz Island are insular
   endemics whose continued existences are uncertain and about which little
   is known. Through trapping, I evaluated relative abundance, sex ratio,
   age structure, and variation in weight according to age, sex, and season
   for both species. Foxes were abundant and easily captured (23\% overall
   trap success), while skunks were rare and difficult to capture (0.57\%
   overall trap success). Male: female ratios for both species did not
   differ significantly from 1:1. Age distribution of foxes revealed a
   large number of young individuals, possibly reflecting a rapidly growing
   population in response to cessation of a prolonged drought. Average
   weight for skunks was 620 g for males and 500 g for females. Average
   weight for foxes was 2.00 kg for adult males and 1.88 kg for adult
   females; males consistently weighed more than females across all age
   classes and seasons. Fox pups grew rapidly, reaching full weight as
   young adults in their first winter. The low rate of success in trapping
   skunks, in conjunction with data from visual sightings, suggests the
   relative rarity of the island spotted skunk on Santa Cruz Island and
   warrants further monitoring of the subspecies.}},

Title = {{ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF MOVEMENTS AND ACTIVITY RANGE FOR THE
   SIDEWINDER, CROTALUS-CERASTES}},
Journal = {{COPEIA}},
Year = {{1994}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{631-645}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the effects of sex, age, and time of year on
   movements and activity ranges of a desert-adapted viperid snake, the
   sidewinder (Crotalus cerastes). In the eastern Mojave Desert, male
   sidewinders traveled (xBAR +/- 1 SE = 185.4 + 17.1 m) significantly
   farther than nongravid females (xBAR = 122.9 +/- 10.1 m) within 24-h
   periods. This was chiefly a result of lengthy movements by adult males
   during the spring and fall mating seasons. Subadult sidewinders (2-3 yr
   old, xBAR = 223.1 +/- 25.3 m) moved significantly greater distances than
   neonates (1-3 months, xBAR = 125.5 +/- 22.0 m), juveniles (6 months-2
   yr, xBAR = 148.3 +/- 14.3 m), and adults (>3 yr, xBAR = 123.8 +/- 12.1
   m). Movements by all snakes were longest during the summer (xBAR = 191.2
   +/- 17.7 m). Actual distances traveled averaged more than twice the
   straight-line distances between the beginning and end of movements,
   demonstrating the distinct tortuosity of C. cerastes movements.
   Sidewinders traveled on average 60\% of the days monitored during their
   activity season (April-Oct.), with a resultant mean daily distance
   traveled of 117.8 +/-11.2 m/day. Although direction of travel was
   generally random, sidewinders exhibited significant directionality
   during the fall as they moved eastwardly to the sand-alluvial interface
   of the study site to overwinter. I speculate that overwintering in
   rodent burrows at the sand-alluvial interface increases overwintering
   survival because of decreased likelihood of exposure to freezing
   subsurface temperatures, greater structural stability of burrows, and
   lower risk of predation. Activity ranges of C. cerastes, calculated by
   minimum convex polygon (xBAR = 23.2 +/- 2.8 ha) and harmonic mean (xBAR
   = 20.9 +/- 2.6 ha) methods, are among the largest documented for snakes.
   For this population of sidewinders, there were no significant
   differences in activity range size between sexes or age classes
   (subadult vs adult). Core areas of activity (harmonic mean 50\%
   isopleths) averaged 9.2 +/- 0.9\% of total activity range size (harmonic
   mean 95\% isopleths) and also did not differ in size between sexes and
   age classes. Activity range size did not correlate with body size (SVL
   and mass), although it did correlate with the number of locality
   coordinates used in its calculation. Activity ranges of individual
   sidewinders overlapped extensively on the study site, and snakes
   commonly shifted their centers of activity seasonally. Sidewinders moved
   their activity centers during the fall to the site's sand-alluvial edge
   and returned to the site's sandy region following emergence from
   hibernation.}},

Abstract = {{A montane population (elev. 690 m) of the jamaican lizard, Anolis
   opalinus, was monitored weekly for 12 months. A greater percentage of
   reproductive individuals was found year-round than in any previously
   described anole from a similar latitude and elevation. The high level of
   annual reproduction occurred in spite of distinct wet-dry periods (171
   cm of rain, May-Oct.; and 32 cm of rain, Nov.-April).
   All males (n = 146) from all months were fully gametogenic.
   Morphometrics of sexual structures, however, reflected some monthly
   variance. Mean monthly testis weight showed a 2.2-fold annual range,
   other measured sex structures fluctuated much less (0.3-0.6-fold). As a
   group, measured variables reached their maxima during April-July and
   minima during Oct.-Nov. The testicular cycle was shifted two months in
   advance of the wet season, with almost no male reproductive structures
   correlated with the annual cycle of climatic variables. Males showed no
   tendency to lose weight during their peak reproductive months. Field
   observations recorded copulations, advertisement displaying, and
   territorial defense the year-round.
   For all females (n = 173), the proportion gravid in monthly samples
   varied from 42\% in Dec. to 100\% in Aug. Though apparently not
   initiated by the onset of rain in May, reproductive variables combined
   to reach their maxima (June-Oct.) during warm wet months. Occurrence of
   females carrying two oviductal eggs began in April and ceased in Oct.;
   total oviductal egg volume overlapped the seven months of highest
   maximum daily temperatures (April-Oct.) and the six months of greatest
   rainfall (May-Oct.). Large oviductal egg size was associated with large
   females, but larger females did not appear to produce more eggs than
   smaller females in either the wet or dry periods. Female reproductive
   variables reached their greatest levels several months after the male
   cycle had registered its maxima; no reproductive variables significantly
   covaried between the sexes.}},

Abstract = {{The number of individual plants and colonies of the two native Antarctic
   vascular plants, Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, have
   been monitored between 1964 and 1990 on three islands in the Argentine
   Islands archipelago, western Antarctic Peninsula. The Deschampsia
   population increased by nearly 25-fold and Colobanthus by over 5-fold.
   Furthermore there was a considerable increase in the number of
   Deschampsia colonies, although no additional colonies of Colobanthus
   were recorded. An analysis of Colobanthus plant size in 1974 and 1990
   indicated that recruitment was probably irregular although the
   population structure remained essentially the same. The reasons for this
   and the increases in population size of both species are discussed. The
   relatively rapid increase in the abundance and distribution of these
   species is considered to be a response to the increasing summer air
   temperatures being experienced in the region of the maritime Antarctic.
   In particular, there is probably improved success in reproductive
   behavior resulting from warmer and/or longer growing seasons.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the severity of carbon monoxide (CO) pollution in
   Taipei, this study conducted a survey of commuting patterns (in a
   district) for random samples of primary school students and adult
   workers, and carried out CO measurements in vehicles and near roadsides.
   A Monte Carlo simulation was then implemented to estimate 1- and 8-h CO
   exposure levels for the population. The microenvironment of the roadside
   included both the sidewalk and the corridor (a sheltered walkway farther
   removed from the road than the sidewalk). By computer simulations, this
   study showed that commuters on motorcycles and public buses were exposed
   to the highest CO exposure levels among all commuters on the roads in
   Taipei. This study also demonstrated that the Monte Carlo simulation
   method could better estimate CO exposure levels for the general public.
   It was found that roadside-fixed monitoring stations operated by the
   Taipei BEP (Bureau of Environmental Protection) underestimated the
   general population's 1-h CO exposure levels. For adult workers, the
   roadside-fixed monitoring stations reasonably estimated the roadside
   business workers' 8-h CO exposure levels, but overestimated the exposure
   levels of general adult workers commuting by public bus, except for bus
   drivers whose CO exposure levels were underestimated. It is suggested
   that the computer simulation method can be used to better guide air
   quality management plans instead of only using the fixed-site monitoring
   data. The simulated results indicate that the CO exposure levels of
   commuters on motorcycles and public buses are high enough that prompt
   control measures are warranted in Taipei.}},

Abstract = {{Reciprocal-removal experiments with two replicates were conducted to
   test for the role of interspecific competition in the coexistence of
   Apodemus argenteus and A. speciosus. Population density, rate of
   appearance of new (unmarked) individuals, reproduction, survival rate
   and habitat use were monitored during pre- and removal periods. In both
   removal experiments, the removal of A. argenteus had little effect on A.
   speciosus, while that of A. speciosus affected several population
   characteristics of A. argenteus. Namely, the removal of A. speciosus
   shifted the distribution of A. argenteus to the habitat with a denser
   shrub cover in one experiment. Also, the removal increased the
   population densities and appearance rates of new individuals of A.
   argenteus in another experiment. Interspecific interactions between the
   two species appeared to be a one-way action from A. speciosus to A.
   argenteus. In removal periods in both experiments, the rates of
   appearance of new individuals in each species were the highest on the
   grid where that species was removed. These results suggest that, though
   interspecific competition occurred between the two species,
   intraspecific competition had greater effects than interspecific
   competition on the abundance and habitat use of A. argenteus and A.
   speciosus. This implies that the fundamental niches of A. argenteus and
   A. speciosus differ potentially, which may play an important role in the
   coexistence of the two species.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the cabbage seedpod weevil, Ceutorhynchus assimilis
   (Paykull), were sampled in Fayette, Haywood, Henry, and Lake counties in
   seven and eight commercial rapeseed, Brassica napus spp. oleifera L.,
   field sites in 1990 and 1991, respectively. The cabbage seedpod weevil
   was the most abundant (98.8\%) of the eight curculionid species
   collected. Adult C. assimilis populations were monitored weekly from 7
   April to 4 June 1990 and from 10 April to 4 June 1991. During early
   season, overwintering C. assimilis adult populations peaked on 27 April
   1990 and 11 April 1991, respectively. Late in the season, adult C.
   assimilis (probable F1) populations peaked again on 4 June 1990 and 22
   May 1991, respectively. Cabbage seedpod weevil populations were
   relatively low at sites in 1990; however, the total weevil population in
   Henry County was 79 times higher than that in Lake County in 1991. In
   the absence of commercial rapeseed fields, weevil densities in 1993 were
   229 times greater on turnip, B. rapa L., in Henry County than in Lake
   County. A hypothesis for the higher weevil populations is that Henry
   County has more available alternate hosts and overwintering sites.
   Because rapeseed is new and C. assimilis is well adapted to this host,
   weevil infestations will likely increase and severely damage rapeseed
   stands as plantings increase in West Tennessee.}},

Abstract = {{Following episodes of environmental contamination, health professionals
   are limited in their ability to detect adverse health effects in
   surrounding communities due to lack of relevant baseline health data,
   resources, and appropriate control populations. The objective of this
   study was to ascertain the feasibility of using administrative health
   data for these purposes. The Manitoba Health Services Commission's
   (MHSC) database is comprehensive since universal health care is free in
   Canada. As part of an evaluation of two proposed hazardous waste
   treatment sites, the feasibility of using MHSC's data was tested by (a)
   defining the two study and control sites through use of MHSC's
   population registry and (b) determining baseline morbidity rates through
   analysis of MHSC's physician visit payment files; diagnoses were coded
   using ICD-9-CM. The results indicated that there were some differences
   between the groups studied in the age- and sex-standardized morbidity
   rates of diagnoses potentially influenced by exposures to chemicals. Use
   of administrative data provided by a national health service is an
   inexpensive and efficient way to create and follow potentially exposed
   cohorts residing in defined communities. Despite limitations related to
   small populations in exposed communities and lack of standardized
   diagnostic criteria by physicians, this method should be explored
   further in environmental studies. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding depression is a major selective force favoring outcrossing in
   flowering plants. Some self-fertilization, however, should weaken the
   harmful effects of inbreeding by exposing genetic load to selection.
   This study examines the maintenance of inbreeding depression in
   partially self-fertilizing populations of the long-lived, herbaceous
   wetland plant, Decodon verticillatus (L.) Ell. (Lythraceae). Estimates
   from ten populations indicate that 30\% of offspring are produced
   through self-fertilization. Population-genetic estimates of inbreeding
   depression (delta = 1 - relative mean fitness of selfed progeny) based
   on changes in the inbreeding coefficient for the same ten populations
   were uniformly high, ranging from 0.49 to 1.79 and averaging 1.11 +/-
   0.29 SE. Although confidence intervals of individual population
   estimates were large, estimates were significantly greater than 0 in six
   populations and greater than 0.5 in four. Inbreeding depression was also
   estimated by comparing growth, survival, and flowering of experimentally
   selfed and outcrossed offspring from two of these populations in a l-yr
   glasshouse experiment involving three density regimes; after which
   offspring were transplanted into garden arrays and two field sites and
   monitored for two consecutive growing seasons. Overall (\$) over cap
   delta for survival averaged 0.27 +/- 0.01 in the glasshouse, 0.33 +/-
   0.04 in the garden, and 0.46 +/- 0.04 in the field. The glasshouse
   experiment also revealed strong inbreeding depression for growth
   variables, especially above-soil dry weight ((\$) over cap delta = 0.42
   +/- 0.03). The fitness consequences of inbreeding depression for these
   growth variables approximately doubles if survival to maturity is
   determined by severe truncation selection. Despite substantial selfing,
   inbreeding depression appears to be a major selective force favoring the
   maintenance of outcrossing in D. verticillatus.}},

Abstract = {{1.  A field study was conducted to: (i) assess feeding habit changes of
   two predatory stoneflies following the loss of larval black fly
   (Diptera:  Simuliidae) prey from two streams; and (ii) determine the
   relative importance of black fly larvae as prey for these and other
   selected predatory benthic macroinvertebrates.
   2.  Acroneuria lycorias and Paragnetina media (Plecoptera:  Perlidae)
   diets were monitored in response to local reductions in larval black fly
   populations caused by Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (B.t.i.)
   in two Michigan streams.  These predators were collected from
   B.t.i.-treated and control sections of the streams, and their foreguts
   inspected for prey.
   3.  Black flies were the major dietary component of both predators
   collected from the control sections, but the number of black flies
   ingested was significantly less for predators collected from
   B.t.i.-treated habitats.  Total number of prey ingested significantly
   decreased for A. lycorias, but not for P. media, and non-black fly prey
   consumption significantly increased for P. media, but not for A. 
   lycorias, following B.t.i.  applications.
   4.  In prey choice trials conducted in experimental channels, A. 
   lycorias and P. media showed no preference between prey types (black
   flies and mayflies).  Body mass gain of individual A. lycorias nymphs
   was measured, and was similar for nymphs in black fly-rich and black
   fly-poor environments.  Conversely, Isoperla signata and I. dicala
   (Plecoptera: Perlodidae) ingested significantly more Simulium vittatum
   (Diptera:  Simuliidae) than Baetis flavistriga (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae)
   or Epeorus vitrea (Heptageniidae) prey.  Boyeria vinosa (Odonata:
   Aeshnidae) ingested significantly more B. flavistriga than S. vittatum
   prey.
   5.  Reducing black fly densities in these streams, using B.t.i.,
   indirectly and differentially affected predators.  In black fly-poor
   environments, feeding habits of specialist predators were most affected,
   and generalist predators least affected because the latter consumed
   alternative prey.  Predator-predator and predator-prey interactions, and
   prey community structure may be affected indirectly by disturbances such
   as B.t.i.  applications by reducing food resources and forcing predation
   onto less preferred prey.}},

Abstract = {{Severely restricted gene flow may be a factor contributing to the
   remarkable amount of morphological variation within the complex species
   Persoonia mollis, in which nine subspecies are recognized. The mating
   system and realized pollen dispersal were studied to assess their effect
   on gene flow. Mating system parameters were estimated in seven natural
   populations over two seasons using allozyme electrophoresis. Realized
   pollen dispersal was measured in two natural populations over two
   seasons by monitoring the dispersion of a rare allozyme from a known
   source plant in each population. Single- and multilocus estimates of
   outcrossing rate (t) were consistently equal to or greater than one
   (i.e. complete outcrossing). Realized pollen dispersal distances showed
   that 99 per cent of the pollen received by given females was donated by
   males on average within 33 m. However, 70 per cent of all pollen
   dispersal was on average to the paternal plant's immediate neighbour.
   Genetic neighbourhood sizes due to pollen dispersal alone ranged from
   one to five plants and paternity pool sizes ranged from four to 22
   plants. These population sizes are small enough to allow genetic
   differentiation in the absence of selection. However, in contrast to the
   expectation that small population size leads to biparental inbreeding
   and reduced heterozygosity compared with Hardy-Weinberg expectations,
   the mean fixation index (F) of -0.035 indicated a slight excess of
   heterozygotes in the seed cohort. This apparent paradox could be the
   result of selection for heterozygous seeds, disassortative mating or
   more likely because gene flow through seed dispersal substantially
   increases the neighbourhood sizes estimated here through pollen
   dispersal alone.}},

   GENTIANA-PNEUMONANTHE IN RELATION TO VEGETATION AND MANAGEMENT IN THE

Abstract = {{1. After analysis of population age-state spectra of Gentiana
   pneumonanthe in a variety of vegetation types, three different
   population types could be distinguished: (a) `invasive' or `dynamic'
   populations, characterized by high densities of seedlings and juveniles
   relative to the adult age states, (b) `normal' or `stable' populations
   with adult age states prevailing, but with low densities of seedlings
   and juveniles, and (c) `regressive' or `senile' populations, consisting
   only of adult flowering and adult vegetative individuals.
   2. The structure of the surrounding vegetation appears to be very
   important in determining the population structure of the marsh gentian.
   In particular the percentage of bare soil surface and the cover of the
   litter layer explain most of the variation in the density and proportion
   of different age states in the populations. The area of bare soil
   surface in the vegetation increases the percentage of seedlings and
   juveniles in the population and, consequently, decreases the proportion
   of generative adults, while the reverse is true for the cover of the
   litter layer.
   3. In heathlands, a clear trend can be observed in the age state
   structure from `invasive' populations in young successional stages, via
   `normal' populations in relatively stable situations, to `regressive'
   populations in late successional stages or unmanaged areas dominated by
   grasses or shrubs. In hay meadows, `normal' populations are usually
   observed, except where mowing has been stopped or where a combination of
   early mowing and acidification exists. This leads to closure of the
   community by grasses or bryophytes, respectively, and therefore to a
   `regressive' population structure.
   4. Individuals in heathland and grassland populations seem to have a
   different life-strategy because of the differences in vegetation
   dynamics between these two habitat types. Ecotypic differentiation in
   life-history characteristics may therefore be expected.
   5. It is argued that, as a basis for conservation and management,
   monitoring the age state structure of populations of rare perennial
   plant species is far more effective than counting only the flowering
   individuals, as is mostly done.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic feeding studies were conducted on the firebrat, Thermobia
   domestica (Zygentoma, Lepismatidae) to determine if the insect's gut
   cellulases were of insect or microbial origin. Firebrats were fed diets
   containing either nystatin, metronidazole, streptomycin, tetracycline,
   or an antibiotic cocktail consisting of all four antibiotics, and then
   their gut microbial populations and gut cellulase levels were monitored
   and compared with the gut microbial populations and gut cellulase levels
   in firebrats feeding on antibiotic-free diets. Each antibiotic
   significantly reduced the firebrat's gut microflora. Nystatin reduced
   the firebrat's viable gut fungi by 89\%. Tetracycline and the antibiotic
   cocktail reduced the firebrat's viable gut bacteria by 81\% and 67\%,
   respectively, and metronidazole, streptomycin, tetracycline, and the
   antibiotic cocktail reduced the firebrat's total gut flora by 35\%,
   32\%, 55\%, and 64\%, respectively. Although antibiotics significantly
   reduced the firebrat's viable and total gut flora, gut cellulase levels
   in firebrats fed antibiotics were not significantly different from those
   in firebrats on an antibiotic-free diet. Furthermore, microbial
   populations in the firebrat's gut decreased significantly over time,
   even in firebrats feeding on the antibiotic-free diet, without
   corresponding decreases in gut cellulase levels. Based on this evidence,
   we conclude that the gut cellulases of firebrats are of insect origin.
   This conclusion implies that symbiont-independent cellulose digestion is
   a primitive trait in insects and that symbiont-mediated cellulose
   digestion is a derived condition.}},

Abstract = {{Muscadine grape vines were excavated from vineyards in southern
   Mississippi and examined for damage caused by the grape root borer.
   Vitacea polistiformis (Harris), and for the presence of borer larvae.
   Generally, young vines (< 12 yr old) had no visible root borer damage
   and no borers were present; vines 12 to 15 yr old had moderate damage
   and borers were present; older vines had severe damage and borers were
   present. Grape root borer populations were monitored over 5 yr with
   pheromone traps. No moths were trapped before 15 June or after 2
   October. Peak moth captures occurred from 15 July through 2 September.
   These data indicate that vineyards in southern Mississippi should be
   treated with an insecticide during the 2nd or 3rd wk of July for
   effective grape root borer control.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-eight Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), populations from
   15 states in soft winter wheat area of the eastern United. States were
   evaluated for biotype composition and response to 14 Hessian fly
   resistance genes. The biotype composition of each Hessian fly population
   was estimated by confining individual gravid females on the wheat
   differentials `Seneca' (H7H8), `Monon' (H3), `Abe' or `Magnum' (H5), and
   `Caldwell' (H6). The response of Hessian fly populations to resistance
   genes not deployed in the eastern United States was evaluated in
   replicated tests with wheat containing H9, H10, H12, H13, H14H15, H17,
   H18, and H19+ genes and two Purdue germplasm lines with unknown sources
   of resistance ('ACC 1566-1-1-IX' and `Giorgio 331-39-10'). Based on
   biotype determinations, H7H8 was resistant or moderately resistant to
   populations from the South and Southeast, H3 and H5 were resistant to
   populations from East Texas, H6 was susceptible to all but the ML-TX
   population, and no deployed genes were resistant to populations from
   most locations in the Midwest and in the Mid-Atlantic region and the
   Northeast. Predominant biotypes in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina
   were E, G, and 0, respectively. Biotype L was predominant in populations
   from the Midwest and some states of the Mid-Atlantic region. Texas
   populations were predominantly GP and A. The most resistant undeployed
   genes or gene combinations were H9, H13, H14H15, and H17, but Hessian
   fly virulence was found to all genes except H17. Continued monitoring of
   biotype frequency in Hessian fly populations is required for optimal
   deployment and management of resistance genes.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in the occurrence of gastrointestinal metazoan parasites in
   flatfish were examined in relation to sewage sludge dumping at an
   `accumulating' and two `dispersing' dump sites in Scottish coastal
   waters. The gross disturbance of the benthic communities at the Garroch
   Head disposal site in the Firth of Clyde and absence of the intermediate
   hosts of particular parasites was not reflected in the parasite fauna of
   the long rough dab, Hippoglossoides platessoides. Results indicate that
   this flatfish host is highly mobile and intermixing within the
   population masked any localized effects of sludge dumping on parasite
   transmission at the dump site. The common dab, Limanda limanda, is
   considered to be relatively static at the St Abb's Head and Bell Rock
   disposal sites off the Firth of Forth where no evidence of effects of
   sewage sludge dumping on its metazoan parasite fauna was detected. This
   is consistent with the results of chemical and biological monitoring of
   the sites. The value of a parasite-based index of the biological effects
   of sewage sludge dumping is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the premise that rates of visitation by raccoons (Procyon
   lotor) to scent stations vary directly with population density by
   manipulating the density of an island population of this carnivore in
   middle Tennessee. Despite its widespread use, the scent-station index to
   population size has not been validated. General protocol for scent
   stations followed previous investigators; radiotelemetry was used to
   monitor individual behavior of raccoons. We determined minimum
   population size from the records of known captures and compared them
   with visits to scent stations recorded twice monthly during an initial
   period with no manipulation (May 1987-August 1988); similar procedures
   were used during an experimental period (September 1988-August 1989)
   when raccoons were removed and held on the mainland for ca. 1 month
   during each season and then returned to the island. Abundance of
   raccoons on the island ranged from 32 to 42 when estimated twice each
   month; computed indices of relative abundance varied from zero to 286.
   Rates of visitation by raccoons were highest in spring and summer during
   both the baseline and experimental period. Visits to scent stations were
   independent of density throughout the study. During the experimental
   period, both the largest and smallest observed indices of relative
   abundance occurred when an estimated 25\% of the population had been
   removed and when all known animals (n = 40) occurred on the island.
   Local fluctuations of populations may precipitate changes in behavior of
   raccoons that preclude the use of scent stations to index abundance,
   particularly in heterogeneous habitats.}},

   1989, 1990, and 1991. Home-range size varied greatly among males (range,
   0.06-47.51 ha). Median home-range size for all males was 1.02 ha, larger
   than previous estimates for the species. Distribution of females and
   localized fluctuations in density of males influenced home-range size of
   males. Home-range size was not related to number of females defended or
   to body mass of males. Several males made excursions from their home
   ranges, perhaps to locate additional mates. These results indicate that
   male marmots behaviorally respond to the density and distribution of
   females.}},

Abstract = {{In mammals, estrus commonly is identified by the behavior of males.
   However, the reliability of this indicator may vary with age or
   experience of males. We monitored fecal-progesterone levels in female
   wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) that were tended. Males tended
   females more often when females were close to estrus (fecal-progesterone
   levels <1 mug/g feces). Subadult males also tended females that were
   clearly not in estrus (progesterone levels >1 mug/g feces). In contrast,
   in an experimental population from which we removed mature males,
   subadults tended females in estrus longer than those not in estrus. Our
   results suggest that although tending behavior of males is a reliable
   indicator of the occurrence of an estrous cycle, the behavior of only
   dominant individuals is meaningful. Subadult males often tend anestrous
   females because young males are excluded from breeding by the more
   dominant, mature males, not because of a lack of experience. When
   investigating the relationship between male behavior and the female's
   ability to produce young, as determined by subsequent births, we found
   that lactating females were more likely to ovulate than nonlactating
   females; but, among ovulation females, lactating and nonlactating
   females did not differ in their probability of producing young. This
   finding suggests that reproductive status of a female affects mostly
   ovulation, not conception. Accordingly, males did not prefer to tend
   ovulating females of either reproductive status.}},

Abstract = {{A study of seedling demography of three shade-tolerant canopy tree
   species (Quararibea asterolepis, Trichilia tuberculata, and Tetragastris
   panamensis) was initiated to integrate with long-term studies of tree
   fruit production and of tree population dynamics on Barro Colorado
   Island, Panama.  Over a five-year period, all seedlings (height <50 cm)
   and small saplings (height greater-than-or-equal-to 50 cm to dbh 1 cm)
   were measured and monitored in permanent tree-centred transects (N =
   10-11 trees per species).  Survival rates increased with plant size
   class and were similar among species.  Maximum height growth rates
   increased with increasing plant size, but average growth rates did not;
   this disparity suggests the importance of release from understorey
   suppression for long-term recruitment success.  Among the three species,
   Quararibea had the lowest standing seedling densities and almost no
   sapling recruitment, whereas Tetragastris had the highest densities of
   both seedlings and saplings; Trichilia seedling and sapling densities
   were intermediate.  In all three species, a few trees produced very high
   seedling and sapling densities in comparison with the sample average. 
   All three species exhibited a year of exceptionally high new seedling
   recruitment during the study period; these good years were not
   coincident among the species but instead reflected the species'
   phenological differences.  Since seedling survival becomes relatively
   constant and high after the first few years of life (c. 80\% y-1), such
   large new cohorts persist as a year-class effect in the seedling
   population and thus maintain seedling numbers over time.  The
   interspecific differences in seedling and sapling dynamics were
   consistent with overall 10-year trends of a declining Quararibea
   population, a stable Trichilia population, and an increasing
   Tetragastris population.}},

Abstract = {{The Waldrapp ibis (Geronticus eremita) is one of the most endangered
   birds in the wild. The only real hope for its survival seems to rest
   with captive propagation, which has fortunately proved straightforward.
   Preservation of genetic diversity for maintaining viable populations is
   a major goal in any species conservation programme. Therefore sensitive
   tools have to be developed for the detection and regular monitoring of
   population variability. Individual identity has to be verified and each
   individual's pedigree defined in order to enable effective selective
   breeding, In this study, extensive DNA fingerprinting technology was
   applied to a group of 39 captive Waldrapp ibises. Five minisatellite
   probes were used. Despite the fact that the colony was founded by only
   six birds and that some of the founders were apparently related, highly
   polymorphic banding patterns were obtained. The human- and pig-derived
   probes MS1, MS31, p lambda g3 and pCMS12 each detected multiple distinct
   loci suitable for individual identification and resolution of parentage.
   Probe MS51 was locus-specific and revealed six different alleles. In
   addition, MS31 and p lambda g3 co-detected a band present in all females
   but none of the males and thus could be used for sex determination. For
   all but four individuals both parents could be identified unambiguously.
   The exceptions were offspring derived from a full sib mating in which
   DNA results allowed no distinction between the parents and the
   grandparents. Comparison of the parentage assigned by DNA analysis and
   by observation of breeding behaviour, respectively, showed agreement in
   al but five instances. Here, DNA data uncovered interchange of
   individuals in the stud book. Application of these minisatellite probes
   therefore offers an extremely sensitive means for individual
   identification and verification and completion of pedigree records.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments were conducted to measure the behavioral responses of
   lobsters, Homarus americanus (Milne-Edwards), to reductions in salinity.
   In the first experiment animals were placed in a 3 ft diameter tank that
   was divided in half by plastic mesh. Spontaneously active lobsters were
   able to move between the two halves of the tank by passing through
   either of two conduits. The conduits were equipped with optical sensors
   to monitor the passage of animals, and a perfusion system to control the
   salinity of the area in, and around, the conduit. When the salinity in
   the vicinity of both conduits was the same (28-32 ppt), lobsters
   exhibited no preference for either conduit. However, when the salinity
   in one of the conduits was lowered, lobsters preferred to pass through
   the high salinity (20-25 ppt) conduit rather than the one with low
   salinity (10-15 ppt). In addition, females appeared to be more selective
   in their preference and exhibited higher overall activity than males
   when exposed to reduced salinity. In the second experiment, individual
   lobsters were placed in a shelter at one end of a long seawater table
   and exposed to seawater of gradually decreasing salinity. The salinity
   required to cause a movement out of a shelter, i.e. an avoidance
   response, was recorded. On average, lobsters first ventured small
   distances (<one body length) out of their shelter when the salinity
   reached a level of 18.4 ppt +/- 1.42 (SEM), and definitively moved away
   from their shelter (> one body length) when levels approached 12.62 ppt
   +/- 1.59. Although it was not statistically significant, females again
   seemed to be either more sensitive to salinity or found it more
   aversive, because they tended to initiate movements at salinities
   greater than those required to influence males. These behavioral data
   indicate that: (1) adult lobsters are capable of detecting changes in
   salinity which are comparable to the levels found during natural
   fluctuations in coastal bays and estuaries; (2) when exposed to low
   salinity of sufficient magnitude, they attempt to avoid it, and; (3)
   females appear to be more sensitive to drops in salinity and/or they
   find it more aversive. Previous studies have demonstrated that estuarine
   lobster populations are dominated by males and that there are seasonal
   migrations of lobsters into, and out of, estuaries. We conclude that the
   behavioral responses of male and female lobsters to low salinity may
   determine, in part, the distribution and movements of lobsters in
   estuarine habitats.}},

Abstract = {{An examination of the vegetation in and around an old-growth oak-hickory
   forest in Central New Jersey suggested that hickories (Carya spp.,
   Juglandaceae) were not regenerating in the forest at the same rate as in
   adjacent wooded hedgerows (5-7 m wide corridors dominated by trees and
   shrubs).  The goal of this study was to experimentally examine how
   factors affecting seed and seedling survival might account for these
   differential recruitment patterns in contrasting landscape elements.  To
   determine seed discovery efficiency by small vertebrates, I planted
   seeds of mockernut hickory (C. tomentosa (Poir.) Nutt.) with and without
   their aromatic husk in both forest and hedgerow.  Regardless of diaspore
   type or habitat, seed discovery by herbivores was found to be 85-100\%
   after only 5 days.  Gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), the principal
   predator-disperser, were determined to be equally abundant in both
   landscape elements.  To assess the effects of diffuse competition and
   predation on seedling establishment and survival, I constructed
   split-plot shade/exclosure cages into which 576 seedlings were explanted
   and subsequently monitored (survival and mortality agent) for three
   years.  Browsing by deer and rabbits resulted in considerable mortality
   after one year, particularly in the forest (64\% mortality) compared to
   the hedgerow (21\% mortality).  During the second year, the major source
   of mortality switched to physiological stress resulting from drought. 
   Mortality due to drought stress was more noticeable in the hedgerow.  By
   the end of the third year few seedlings remained alive (ca. 1\% in
   forest, 10\% in hedgerow).  Over the 3-yr period, a small percentage of
   seedlings were lost due to other factors such as root grubbing, whole
   plant removal, and litterfall.  Shading (50\%), to emulate diffuse
   competition by overstory, was not found to affect survival to any
   significant extent in either habitat.  Phytophagous insects did not
   result in any observable mortality but did remove 1-10\% of the leaf
   area of the majority of seedlings in both habitats in each field season.
   I conclude that certain stages of recruitment may be significantly
   influenced by the presiding landscape element.}},

Abstract = {{Goldfish (Carassius auratus L.) were acclimated to three types of
   thermal regime: constant temperature (12, 28 degrees C), a diurnal
   sine-wave cycle (20 +/- 8 degrees C), and a randomly fluctuating pattern
   of +/-2 degrees C changes at 2-h intervals between 12 and 28 degrees C.
   Assessment of hematological response was based on determination of total
   red cell numbers and hematocrit values, and through characterization of
   circulating red cell populations in terms of absolute and relative
   abundances of juvenile, developing, mature, Trypan Blue-positive,
   karyorrhectic, dividing, and tailed or recently divided cells. While no
   significant differences in cell counts were observed, cell population
   composition was markedly affected by temperature regime. Variation
   during acclimation, particularly when this resembled that likely to be
   experienced under natural circumstances, was associated with
   significantly increased numbers of juvenile and developing cells, and
   thus with increased potential for reorganization of hemoglobin isomorph
   systems. The converse was true of mature cell abundances; these varied
   inversely with temperature and were significantly reduced under varying
   temperature conditions. It is concluded that studies involving constant
   acclimation temperatures are unlikely to provide valid information
   regarding functional hematological status, in this species at least. It
   is also concluded that the primary hematological indices and their
   derivatives (red cell numbers, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean erythrocytic
   volume, and hemoglobin) commonly used to monitor hematological response
   to environmental change are insufficiently sensitive for the purpose.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton is considered a key component mediating the
   ocean-atmospheric exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. Lab simulations
   which model biological responses to atmospheric change are difficult to
   translate into natural settings owing in part to the vertical migration
   of phytoplankton. In the sea this vertical migration acts to regulate
   actual carbon dioxide consumption. To capture some critical properties
   of this vertical material transfer, we monitored the effects of
   atmospheric CO2 on dense suspensions of bioconvecting microorganisms.
   Bioconvection refers to the spontaneous patterns of circulation which
   arise among such upwardly swimming cells as alga, protozoa, zoospore and
   large bacteria. Gravity, phototaxis and chemotaxis have all been
   implicated as affecting pattern-forming ability. The ability of a
   biologically active suspension to detect atmospheric changes offers a
   unique method to quantify organism adjustment and vertical migration.
   With increasing CO2, bioconvection patterns in alga (P. parva) and
   protozoa (T. pyriformis) lose their robustness, and surface cell
   populations retreat from the highest CO2 regions. Cell movement (both
   percent motile and mean velocity) generally diminishes. A general
   program of image analysis yields statistically significant variations in
   macroscopic migration patterns; both fractal dimension and various
   crystallographic parameters correlate strongly with carbon dioxide
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)
   and the Municipal and Energy Research Centre in Martigny (CREM) have led
   towards the identification of original town management and complex
   systems concepts which integrate planning, cadastres, and real-time
   management under the neologism of urbistics. To illustrate an example,
   this presentation deals with the modelling of pollution-reduction
   strategies via actions on heating systems and the adaptation of public
   and private transport networks in the Swiss conurbation of Lausanne. It
   also describes the installation of a system for forest fire surveillance
   and fire-fighting in the Bouches-du-Rhone in France. The application
   will include the monitoring of fire-fighting vehicles via satellite and
   alerting the population with automated telephone calls controlled by
   numeric models forecasting affected areas. These two examples show how
   to employ map-based an urban data for the benefit of the public, its
   security, and the environment. Starting with the concepts and passing
   through real applications, this presentation covers the stages right up
   to final realisation, in order that the limits and advantages of these

Abstract = {{Many problems in fisheries science require markers to discriminate among
   individuals, populations, or species and to monitor representatives of
   these groupings through time. The nucleotide sequences of DNA typically
   offer more than 3 billion potentially informative markers-many orders of
   magnitude more than alternative approaches. Molecular techniques, once
   tedious, have advanced so that rapidly analyzing the numerous samples
   typically required to resolve fisheries problems is now possible. To
   date, most molecular analyses in fisheries science have focused on
   analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), but newer approaches involving
   nuclear DNA (nDNA) show great promise. In particular, noncoding single
   copy nDNA may be more informative than mtDNA analyses for anadromous and
   marine species, in which low genetic diversity is frequently
   encountered. In this paper, we outline 12 categories of fisheries
   problems amenable to molecular approaches and provide a review of the
   structure and analysis of DNA, the nature of DNA variation in fishes,
   and the modes of analysis most suitable for particular questions. The
   future should witness the routine implementation of these techniques;
   such efforts would be enhanced by increased communication between
   managers and researchers, centralization of facilities, and
   standardization of nomenclature.}},

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal structure of a population of the deep-water shrimp
   Aristeus antennatus on the fishing grounds off Barcelona, Spain, in the
   western Mediterranean Sea was studied, and the relationship between
   fluctuations in catch of this species and spatio-temporal changes in the
   size and sex composition of shoals is described. Fluctuations were
   monitored by using a sample design based on fixed seasonal sampling of
   three different habitats (upper submarine canyon, middle slope, and
   lower slope). The results explain changes in fishing fleet and fishing
   location. The stock appears to remain constant at approximately optimum
   levels of exploitation because part of it is unexploited below 1,000 m.
   Factorial correspondence analysis indicated a generally strong influence
   of depth on the abundance of deep-water shrimp, explaining 63.14\% of
   the variance. However, the influence of seasonality was stronger when
   only samples taken at depths shallower than 1,000 m (75.22\%) were
   considered. Females contributed most to the catches on the upper and
   middle slope throughout the year, and catches of females were strongly
   related to seasonality (P<0.05). The combined interaction of depth and
   seasonality on the abundance of males was significant (P<0.05).
   Juveniles were present in the catches from autumn to spring, and the
   combined effect of depth and seasonality on the abundance of juveniles
   was also significant (P<0.05). The role of the regional submarine canyon
   as a zone of higher energy and biomass in the recruitment of this
   species is discussed, and the importance of spatio-temporal factors
   linked to the life cycle of deep-water shrimps is highlighted. The
   results demonstrate that comprehensive ecological studies of exploited
   species are essential to proper fisheries management.}},

   were monitored through spring and summer.  Nest sites (n = 6) had
   greater (P = .032) horizontal cover than did independent random plots (n
   = 7).  During summer, grouse used sites (n = 50) with taller live and
   dead shrub heights, greater shrub canopy cover, and more ground litter
   (P < .009) than were found on dependent random plots (n = 50) 50-300 m
   from use sites.  Distance to edge and mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia
   tridentata vaseyana) density best separated use sites from independent
   random plots in logistic regression analysis and correctly classified
   64\% of the use sites and 78\% of the independent random plots.  Sage
   Grouse used sites that had narrower frequency distributions for many
   variables than did independently plots (P < .04), suggesting selection
   for uniform habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the aggregation inhibitors verbenone and ipsdienol on
   the response of western pine beetle, Dendroctonus brevicomis, to
   attractive host trees was investigated. Paired ponderosa pine trees
   (Pinus ponderosa) were baited with aggregation semiochemicals to
   stimulate mass attack. One tree in each pair received an inhibitor
   treatment consisting of five sets of two verbenone and two ipsdienol
   dispensers spaced 1 m apart vertically along the tree bole. Beetle
   landing was monitored with sticky traps on the tree bole, and attack
   density was assessed from bark samples removed four or seven days after
   baiting. The inhibitor treatment resulted in a significant reduction of
   both the numbers of beetles landing on trees and the density of
   attacking beetles compared to control trees (without inhibitors). The
   ratios of beetle landing density to attacking density were not different
   between inhibitor-treated and control trees, nor were the vertical
   distributions of beetles landing or attacking, suggesting that beetle
   behavior was primarily influenced at a longer range, prior to landing on
   the tree. Although the application of verbenone and ipsdienol did not
   prevent D. brevicomis from attacking baited trees, our results suggest
   that when applied to unattacked (and unbaited) trees, their
   effectiveness at reducing the attack pressure might allow trees having a
   certain amount of resistance to survive attack by pioneer beetles.}},

Abstract = {{The susceptibility of Aphis gossypii (Glover) reared on watermelon or
   cotton to seven insecticides was determined using a Petri dish bioassay.
   Baseline susceptibility values to each insecticide for susceptible
   laboratory A gossypii colonies varied between host plants, but aphids
   reared on cotton were generally more tolerant to insecticides than
   aphids from watermelon. The ratio of relative susceptibility of cotton
   aphids to melon aphids was as much as 1000 with dimethoate or 415 with
   bifenthrin, however, no significant differences in susceptibility was
   observed with chlorpyrifos between aphid populations from the two host
   plants. Orders of toxicity for the seven insecticides varied between
   host plant, but on watermelon, the order of toxicity was bifenthrin >
   oxydemeton-methyl > methomyl > dicrotophos > dimethoate > chlorpyrifos >
   endosulfan. Because of the wide range of response to insecticide doses
   observed with bifenthrin on melon aphid and with dimethoate and
   endosulfan against cotton aphid, use of the Petri dish bioassay method
   as a discriminating-dose field bioassay for these insecticides may not
   provide consistent estimations of the resistant nature of field
   populations. Bioassay data taken at 3 h were generally more consistent
   and provided a more predictive mortality model than those taken at 2 or
   4 h for most insecticides. LC50 values estimated for dimethoate with
   melon aphids using leaf-spray or leaf residue bioassays differed little
   from LC50 values estimated with the Petri dish bioassay. Because Petri
   dish bioassays cost less than half as much as plant-based bioassays,
   provide comparable results, and require less assay time, this method is
   more suitable for use in monitoring for insecticide resistance in melon
   aphid.}},

Abstract = {{A study of biological filtration on granular activated carbon (GAC) has
   been performed at the Neuilly-sur-Marne (France) treatment plant using
   experimental pilot filters. Bacterial colonization of GAC was monitored
   in three carbon filters having varying depths and filtration velocities,
   but similar empty bed contact time (EBCT). About three months were
   required to colonize the GAC in the filters and a steady state bacterial
   biomass of around 2 mugC/cm3 GAC was reached. During the colonization
   period, removal of nonbiodegradable organic carbon (NBDOC) by filtration
   decreased from 50\% to less than 10\% showing a gradual saturation of
   GAC adsorption capacity. However, biological processes take turn with
   adsorption to ensure a significant removal of biodegradable dissolved
   organic carbon (BDOC) during the study period (more than 200 days).
   Filters operating under different conditions did not show any difference
   in the BDOC removal. This indicates that biological removal of organic
   matter in GAC filters having a given EBCT is independent of filtration
   rate (in the range 6 m/h-18 m/h). The maximum bacterial density in the
   filter effluent water was 1.5 x 10(5) bacteria/mL during the
   colonization phase; this seemed to be linked to a lag in establishing a
   protozoan population, which, at equilibrium, efficiently removed
   bacterial biomass produced within the filters. Once established, the
   efficiency of this complex microbial assemblage was remarkable; the
   removal of about 0.25 mgC/L of BDOC resulted in the release of less than
   0.5 x 10(5) bacteria per millileter, around 0.0015 mgC/L as bacterial
   biomass in effluent.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial patterns of Anopheles freeborni Aitken and Culex tarsalis
   Coquillett larvae were studied during summer by sampling with a standard
   mosquito dipper in 104 rice fields in northern California. Culex
   tarsalis larval abundance was highest initially, then decreased and
   remained low through late summer. An. freeborni larval abundance was low
   initially, increased steadily, and peaked in mid-August. The degree of
   aggregation for both species as measured using Taylor's power law and
   Iwao's Patchiness Regression was highest among the first instars and
   then decreased as the larvae aged. Seasonal peaks in the degree of
   aggregation were observed. Analysis of covariance showed that for
   Taylor's model both instar and time effects were statistically
   significant, with instar showing the largest effect. In comparison, all
   slopes resulting from Iwao's model were significantly different,
   indicating that this model was affected by specific combinations of
   instar, week, and location and, thus, was less useful in developing an
   area-wide sampling plan. Optimal sample size was estimated using two
   methods. One method calculated the number of dips needed to estimate
   population abundance at three fixed-precision levels. The second
   calculated the minimum number of dips needed to collect at least one
   larva. The latter requires a substantially smaller sample size and may
   provide an effective method for monitoring larval mosquito abundance for
   control purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Pen-reared ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) hens are commonly
   released by private managers to augment wild pheasant populations in
   South Dakota. To evaluate this practice, I radiomarked wild (n = 44) and
   pen-reared (n = 159) ring-necked pheasant hens to monitor their survival
   and reproduction in 2 study areas in eastern South Dakota, 1990-92.
   Survival of pen-reared hens (7.8 +/- 2.4\% SE) was lower (P < 0.001)
   than that of wild hens (54.6 +/- 6.6\%) during the 181-day reproductive
   period because of higher (P < 0.001) predation (90.3 +/- 2.9\% and 45.4
   +/- 6.6\%, respectively). Fewer (P < 0.001) pen-reared hens (21\%)
   initiated nest incubation than did wild pheasants (68\%). Surviving
   pen-reared hens (38\%) were less (P = 0.03) successful in nesting than
   were wild hens (63\%), but brood-rearing success did not differ (P =
   0.17) with treatment (56 and 83\%, respectively). Wild hens recruited 34
   broods/ 1 00 hens compared with 3 broods/100 hens for pen-reared hens.
   Because of low survival and reproductive rates, pen-reared hens should
   not be released in habitats containing wild pheasants.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were performed to investigate grazer remineralization and

   plankton prey. Metal isotope activity incorporated into planktonic prey
   was added to bottles containing crustacean zooplankton grazers, and
   distribution of the added metals into dissolved, fecal pellet and grazer
   fractions was monitored over time. At the end of a 9 to 10 h grazing
   period, concentrations of dissolved metal isotopes were approximately 3
   to 7 times higher in bottles with grazers than in control bottles
   without grazers. An experiment in which flagellate grazers were fed
   Fe-labeled cyanobacteria suggested that protozoans may also remineralize
   trace metals ingested with prey. Metal assimilation efficiencies from
   diatom and flagellate prey were determined in crustacean grazers;
   efficiencies generally decreased in the order Zn > Fe > Mn. These
   experiments indicate that biologically required trace metals behave much
   like major nutrients during grazing, and suggest that biologically
   mediated regeneration and recycling could be an important part of the

   Individual plants usually remained dormant for 1-2 years. Population
   estimates of plants with prolonged dormancy based on random sampling
   methods will often underestimate density. Permanent plot methods with
   repeated measures analysis can be used to monitor change in population

Abstract = {{New technology, that is based on miniaturization of electronic equipment
   and progress in computers, now enables us to get data on the foraging
   behavior of Antarctic birds and mammals. This technical revolution is of
   a major scientific importance because until recently it was considered
   impossible to study where animals feed and how much they consume.
   Accordingly, feeding strategies may now be studied in relation to
   breeding status or availability in marine resources. This, in turn,
   facilitates the use of antarctic animals as indicators of the changes in
   these resources. Automatic indentification and weighing of breeding
   seabirds has also become possible. This means changes in their body
   condition, i.e. body fuel reserves and food stores at sea, can be
   monitored. Thus a short-term indication of the changes in the
   availability of some marine resources may now be obtained. These new
   methods represent a major advance because they open new research
   possibilities, whereby antarctic animals can be individually monitored
   or at a population level, ashore and at sea, while minimizing human
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out on cobalt (Co) excretion in the urine of 12
   workers exposed to known cobalt concentrations in the stone cutting
   diamond wheel production and in six volunteers: four of these were
   exposed in the same work environment for a whole workshift and the other
   two were exposed to cobalt in a cabin under experimental conditions. The
   kinetics of the urinary excretion was multiphase: (i) a first stage of
   rapid elimination (T 1/2' = 43.9 h.); (ii) a second phase of slower
   elimination (T 1/2'' = 10 days); (iii) a longer period of retention, of
   the order of years, in subjects with higher exposure. In the control
   group (4 subjects), the excretion proved to be much faster in the first
   stage (T 1/2' = 20 h). The different behaviour of the two groups could
   be related to the different body burden, of cobalt and/or to the
   possibility of different kinetics induced by continuous exposure to the
   metal. Moreover, 3 weeks after the removal of the workers from exposure
   the urinary cobalt concentrations were not within the normal limits of
   CoU for the general population, (even for workers exposed to cobalt
   levels of the same order as the TLV). The increase of CoU concentrations
   in the first 3 h after the end of exposure, stresses the problem of when
   urine samples for biological monitoring of the workers should be
   collected. The present study confirms the utility of CoU in
   discriminating between exposed and non-exposed subjects as well as in
   assessing high and low level exposure.}},

Abstract = {{An occupational health and industrial hygiene survey was carried out in

   No. 60 - Vimercate (Northern Italy). The principal objectives of the
   study were to assess occupational cobalt exposure, identify the measures
   required to improve the `risk' situations, and implement specific health
   protocols. The results identified a variable level of occupational
   hazard in the tool grinding sector. An important factor in the
   containment of occupational exposure was, along with correct practical
   procedures, the existence of adequate primary prevention measures
   (aspiration systems over the machines). In the plants where good
   industrial hygiene conditions prevailed, environmental cobalt
   concentrations were below the TLV, whereas the levels recorded in plants
   with inadequate equipment were as much as 10 times the TLV. Similarly,
   urinary cobalt for the workers in these same plants was as much as 13
   times higher than the reference population value. However, this was
   recorded in plants with good industrial hygiene conditions. After
   technical improvements, the results of biological monitoring showed an
   overall reduction in exposure indicator values.}},

Abstract = {{Settled dust mineralogy and granulometry of the Negev semi-arid desert
   were examined in samples collected at 1 and 3 m above ground level over
   a period of 5 years. Evaporation ponds which are designed to collect
   industrial waste, overflow and contaminate the loess in which they are
   built and the dust that settled around them. Some of this dust is
   incorporated in new loess, and some dust continues its transport to new
   locations, carrying the contaminants with it. Kaolinite and calcite
   particles in the dust deposits were found to serve as hosts to grains of
   quarts, pollen, and stamen that were much smaller in diameter and were
   tightly attached to the surfaces of the particles. The median diameters
   of the particles at both levels varied between 4 and 50 mum, and the
   coarsest diameters approached 150 mum. Most of the finest five
   percentile fraction, during 4 of the 5 years, were below 4 mum in
   diameter at both levels. These particles are small enough to enter the
   alveoli of our lungs. Modal triangle analyses show that the loess is
   better sorted in relation to the local dust, and it is coarser grained.
   It is suggested that the local winds may supply coarse particles at
   ground level, and light rainy events may remove, by suspension, some of
   the finer particles, thus converting the constitution of the local dust
   deposits into the highly porous structure of loess; thus creating a
   potential trap for a large volume of liquid industrial waste. Lognormal
   distribution of the same samples shows variation from non-lognormalcy in
   the dust, to approximately 100\% lognormalcy in the loess. Two major
   constituents, quartz and calcite, dominate in all the samples, but finer
   grained dust populations are richer in calcite vs. quartz than coarser
   populations. Dust east of the monitoring station is different from that
   west of it, as is the geology in the corresponding areas. The several
   industrial plants east of the dust monitoring station also contribute to
   the elemental dust composition.}},

Abstract = {{The mangrove around Sungei Pemburongunan, just west of Tanjong Batu and
   Istana Darul Aman in the Brunei-Muara District, is unique in that it
   contains the only pure stand of Avicennia marina in Brunei Darussalam.
   In mid-October, 1990 the mouth of Sungei Pemburongunan was closed due to
   a natural build-up of a sandbar across it. The mangrove quickly became
   flooded and adverse effects on the flora and fauna were observed during
   the following weeks. In mid-December a channel was dug across the sand
   bar to reduce the flooding and normalise the ecology. Some of the dying
   Avicennia and Lumnitzera have since recovered but others such as
   Acrostichum and Casuarina have not. Avicennia showed some interesting
   responses to prolonged inundation. Many of the Avicennia that had
   flowered during the flood produced seedlings which are now well rooted
   and 40-80 cm in height. The survival of large numbers of these seedlings
   is attributed to the floor-related decrease in the number of grapsid and
   sesarmid crabs which predate on them. The crab and mollusc populations
   have largely recovered. Unlike periodic short-term flooding which does
   not seem to have any apparent adverse affect on the ecosystem, prolonged
   inundation can result in the loss of the Avicennia and its associated
   flora and fauna. Thus, fragile mangrove ecosystems such as this need to
   be monitored and managed closely.
   This work demonstrates that contrary to conventional wisdom, human
   intervention and management can be beneficial to more fragile
   ecosystems, which could otherwise succumb to natural processes.
   Furthermore, it highlights the importance of the dynamic nature of the
   environment which should be considered in management and conservation
   programmes.}},

Abstract = {{The social behaviour and organization of red lechwe (Kobus leche leche
   Gray 1850) were studied for 2.5 years (January 1975-June 1977) and were
   monitored for 7.5 years thereafter (until December 1984). Agonistic,
   territorial, sexual and maternal-filial behaviour in lechwe were
   documented. The salient feature of red lechwe social organization in the
   Linyanti Swamp was that breeding occurred on clustered mating
   territories, which were resource based. Other findings included: (1)
   significant intraspecific differences in group size, which were
   attributed to factors other than those used by Jarman (1974) to explain
   interspecific variation in group size; (2) differences in the dynamics
   of territoriality in the lechwe populations of the Linyanti Swamp and
   the Kafue Flats, which were associated with ecololgical and demographic
   differences; (3) a prediction that lek-breeding members of the genus
   Kobus would show a higher degree of sexual dimorphism than non-lek
   breeding members was not unequivocally confirmed by a comparison of the
   Kafue and Linyanti lechwe populations.}},

Abstract = {{The tadpole shrimp (Triops longicaudatus LeConte) is a potential
   biological control agent for some species of mosquitoes developing in
   temporary aquatic habitats. It is an effective larval predator that also
   actively deters mosquito oviposition. Its use in practical control
   programs depends in part on its ability to establish permanent
   populations where it is introduced. Introductions of its
   desiccation-resistant eggs (both lab-reared and field-collected) as well
   as gravid adults were made in 16 ponds in southern California. Tadpole
   shrimp density was monitored over five floodings from Fall 1991 through
   Summer 1992. The tadpole shrimp was able to colonize and persist in 94\%
   of the ponds. All methods of introducing T. longicaudatus were
   successful, but its hardy egg is the preferred stage for field
   distribution. The hatching rate for lab-reared shrimp eggs in the ponds
   ranged from 13.7 to 19.4\% (XBAR = 15.9\%, N = 1135-2353/pond). In a
   following experiment, a high density of tadpole shrimp was shown to have
   a significant negative impact on mosquito larvae (Culicidae) (P < 0.05),
   and on nontarget midge larvae (Chironomidae) (P < 0.05), but not on two
   other abundant insects-mayflies (Baetidae) or brine flies (Ephydridae).

Abstract = {{Parameter estimates reflecting age-specific growth of Subantarctic fur
   seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis) on Cough Island were fitted to three
   sigmoidal (Gompertz, logistic, and von Bertalanfly) growth curves. With
   a few exceptions, the logistic fit provided the best mathematical
   approximation of postnatal growth in fur seals from Cough Island,
   although all fits were significant. Standard length is a better
   reflection of age-specific changes in size than mass, which displayed
   considerable variance. Growth was characterized by marked sexual
   dimorphism. Interisland comparisons of body size from throughout the
   geographic range of the species suggested a latitudinal graded
   difference in adult body size, with the largest animals occurring at
   low-latitude Amsterdam Island and the smallest at Marion Island, which
   lies just north of the Antarctic Polar Front. These growth and body-size
   estimates can be used for monitoring the effects of population or
   ecosystem changes on fur seal productivity, but significant
   standardization of data collection procedures need to be introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Passive cloches were deployed at three altitudinally distinct sites on
   Signy Island, maritime Antarctica, to investigate the effect of
   ameliorated thermal environment upon fellfield microarthropod
   communities. Temperature was monitored at 1.5 m height, at ground
   surface level, and at 5 cm depth in cloche and control plots. During
   summer (December - March), cloches elevated monthly mean temperatures by
   up to 2.46-degrees-C at the soil surface and 2.20-degrees-C at 5 cm
   depth. Integrated air temperatures over consecutive 10 d periods were up
   to 4.65-degrees-C warmer in cloches than controls. During winter (April
   - November), snow cover of the fellfield sites buffered temperature
   variation and reduced the treatment effect. After eight years of these
   manipulations, sampling of the upper 50 mm of soil revealed consistently
   greater microarthropod populations within cloches than in controls
   (treatment effect: p < 0.05). Maximum difference occurred at high
   altitude where thermal amelioration was greatest (site effect: p <
   0.05). Cloche populations of the numerically dominant collembolan
   Cryptopygus antarcticus Willem contained an increased proportion of
   small (length < 750 mum) individuals. No species new to Signy Island
   were recorded. Relating these microarthropod populations to the
   ameliorated thermal environment suggests that Antarctic invertebrate
   communities may respond to global warming, as predicted by global
   circulation models, with an increase in abundance with little increase
   in diversity. However, this response could be indirect, the intermediate
   controlling factor being the percentage cover of the soil surface by
   vegetation, itself a function of climate change.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Changes in agricultural practice in eastern England have been shown to
   have had marked effects upon the winter population size of the
   woodpigeon Columba palumbus. This study examines whether changes in the
   breeding success of the woodpigeon have also occurred. Data were
   gathered between 1962 and 1983 on the breeding activities of woodpigeons
   within a wood near Newmarket in eastern England. The number of nests
   monitored each year varied between 16 and 122 with a mean of 45.
   Agricultural changes resulted in a steep decline in the winter
   population size in the late 1960's and the breeding population showed a
   similar fall. Before this decline, productivity was on average 2.8 young
   per pair, but afterwards it was only 1.8 young per pair. This drop in
   productivity resulted from greater egg predation; which increased
   steadily over the study period. Increased egg predation and variation in
   seasonal patterns of breeding behaviour are discussed in relation to
   likely predator numbers and changes in both agricultural and shooting
   practices. In the 1960's, overwinter starvation was the major limiting
   factor on the woodpigeon population, but after the mid-1970's low
   productivity has increasingly become the most important factor.}},

Title = {{DYNAMICS OF GROSS NITROGEN TRANSFORMATIONS IN AN OLD-GROWTH FOREST - THE
   CARBON CONNECTION}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a 456-d laboratory incubation of an old-growth coniferous
   forest soil to aid in the elucidation of C controls on N cycling
   processes in forest soils. Gross rates of N mineralization,
   immobilization, and nitrification were measured by N-15 isotope
   dilution, and net rates of N mineralization and nitrification were
   calculated from changes in KCl-extractable inorganic N and NO3- -N pool
   sizes, respectively. Changes in the availability of C were assessed by
   monitoring rates of CO2 evolution and the sizes of extractable organic C
   and microbial biomass pools. Net and gross rates of N mineralization
   (r(2) = 0.038, P =.676) and nitrification (r(2) = 0.403, P =.125)were
   not significantly correlated over the course of the incubation,
   suggesting that the factors controlling N consumptive and productive
   processes do not equally affect these processes. A significant increase
   in the NO3- pool size (net nitrification) only occurred after 140 d,
   when the NO3- pool size increased suddenly and massively. However, gross
   nitrification rates were substantial throughout the entire incubation
   and were poorly correlated with these changes in NO(3)(-)pool sizes.
   Concurrent decreases in the microbial biomass suggest that large
   increases in NO3- pool sizes after prolonged incubation of coniferous
   forest soil may arise from reductions in the rate of microbial
   immobilization of NO3-, rather than from one of the mechanisms proposed
   previously (e.g., sequestering of NH4+ by microbial heterotrophs, the
   deactivation of allelopathic compounds, or large increases in
   autotrophic nitrifier populations). Strong correlations were found
   between rates of CO2 evolution and gross N mineralization (r(2) = 0.974,
   P <.0001) and immobilization (r(2) = 0.980, P <.0001), but not between
   CO2 evolution and net N mineralization rates. Microbial growth
   efficiency, determined by combining estimates of gross N immobilization,
   CO2 evolution, and microbial biomass C and N pool sizes, declined
   exponentially over the incubation. These results suggest the utilization
   of lower quality substrates as C availability declined during
   incubation. Results from this research indicate the measurement of gross
   rates of N transformations in soil provides a powerful tool for
   assessing C and N cycling relationships in forests.}},

Abstract = {{An epizootic of sarcoptic mange was prevalent among Scandinavian red
   foxes (Vulpes vulpes) during the late 1970s and 1980s. By substantially
   reducing the population density of foxes, the epizootic created a
   natural experiment on the importance of fox predation for prey density.
   The fox population started to recover during the late 1980s. We
   monitored the populations of the fox and its prey {[}voles (Cricetidae),
   mountain hare (Lepus timidus), European hare (L. europaeus),
   Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Black Grouse (T. tetrix), Hazel Grouse
   (Bonasa bonasia), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)] throughout the
   event, on a local (10(1)-10(2) km(2)), a regional (10(4) km(2)), and a
   national scale. Methods included den counts, snap-trapping,
   pellet/dropping counts, counts of displaying birds, young/adult ratio
   from incidental observations of deer, regional questionnaires, and
   national hunting records. The study revealed red fox predation as a
   crucial factor in limiting the numbers of hares and grouse as well as
   fawns per doe of roe deer in autumn, and in conveying the 3-4 yr cyclic
   fluctuation pattern of voles to small game. The classical view, that
   predators take but a `'doomed surplus'' of their prey, was false for
   these species in Scandinavia.}},

Abstract = {{The subcellular distribution of chitin synthetase was assessed in cell
   homogenates of the slime mutant of Neurospora crassa. The activities of
   several marker enzymes were monitored to establish the relationship
   between organelles containing chitin synthetase and other cytoplasmic
   organelles. Before cell breakage, the plasma membrane of the slime
   mutant was radiolabeled with traces of {[}H-3]concanavalin A. Two major
   (I, II) and two minor (III, IV) bands of particles containing chitin
   synthetase were detected after sedimentation of crude cell homogenates
   on a discontinuous sucrose gradient {[}1-4 h at 81,500g (R(av))]. The
   main population (I) consisted of microvesicles (chitosomes) which
   sedimented more slowly than most other membranous organelles. The other
   major population (II) of chitin synthetase particles cosedimented with
   the plasma membrane markers, {[}H-3]concanavalin A and a
   vanadate-sensitive ATPase. Despite differences in sedimentation
   velocity, the two major chitin synthetase populations (I and II)
   eventually equilibrated at the same buoyant density (1.12 g/ml). One of
   the two minor bands (III) of chitin synthetase was associated with
   plasma membrane surface marker. Band IV, the smallest fraction with
   chitin synthetase activity was not characterized. A soluble, dialyzable,
   partially thermostable factor found in the cytosol of N. crassa enhanced
   the chitin synthetase activity of chitosomes (4.6 to 4.8-fold); to a
   lesser extent (about 2-fold) it also enhanced the activity of the other
   chitin synthetase populations. This stimulatory factor found in the
   upper portion of the gradients affected the levels of chitin synthetase
   activity detected, particularly that of chitosomes in peak I. By a
   combination of centrifugation procedures, the subcellular populations of
   chitin synthetase were clearly separated from other organelles with
   similar {[}endoplasmic reticulum, d = 1.118, marker: phosphatidyl
   choline glyceride transferase] or different equilibrium densities
   {[}vacuole, d = 1.170 g/ml, marker: alpha-mannosidase; mitochondria, d =
   1.175, marker: succinate dehydrogenase]. The absence of markers for
   plasma membrane, mitochondria, and vacuoles from the chitosome
   population and the partial but unequivocal separation of the endoplasmic
   reticulum marker from chitosomal chitin synthetase provide additional
   verification that these microvesicles are distinct subcellular
   structures and not fragments of other organelles. The findings support
   the existence of a unique secretory pathway based on chitosome
   microvesicles as the main conveyors of chitin synthetase to the cell
   surface. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Transplasmic lines, in which the original mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) had
   been completely replaced by the mtDNA of the donor, were constructed to
   test for selection on mtDNA variants and to investigate the effects of
   nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions in Drosophila simulans. These lines
   were used to set up 12 experimental populations putting in competition
   two mtDNA variants with two different starting frequencies. Population
   cages were maintained for 20 generations and periodically sampled to
   monitor haplotype frequencies. Evidence is provided for a complete
   reversal of the forces acting on the frequency dynamics of the mtDNA
   variants according to the lines used to establish the population cages.
   In the cages where the competing lines had both the original nuclear and
   mtDNA, the siII type mtDNA variant seemed to be favoured but the
   situation was reversed when this variant was put in a different nuclear
   background.}},

Abstract = {{We present observations on the breeding patterns in a free-ranging
   population of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus. We found evidence of
   the simultaneous presence of two reproductively active females in all
   three monitored groups. We recorded at least one full reproductive cycle
   (conception-birth) for two females in each group, but other adult
   females did not breed. An overview of data from other callitrichid field
   studies indicates that the observed pattern may be an additional
   characteristic of the flexibility of the social organization of common
   marmosets. Comparisons with data from other sites where callithrix has
   been studied indicate that the presence of a second breeding female in a
   group may be related to high population density, though the underlying
   mechanisms remain unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Release of sterile backcross males from {[}Heliothis subflexa (F.) X H.
   virescens (Guenee) females X H. virescens males] has been suggested as a
   means of reducing populations of H. virescens. A simple method is needed
   to measure the persistence or dispersal of the backcross sterility
   genetic factors. Backcross male sterility is transmitted via maternal
   inheritance. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) also is inherited maternally;
   therefore, the mtDNA in the backcross is from H. subflexa. Several
   regions of the mtDNA were amplified using polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR), then were cut with restriction enzymes to generate restriction
   fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). Differences between H. virescens
   and backcross mtDNA were observed for 16S (ribosomal DNA (rDNA)),
   12S-16S rDNA, and the COI-COII (cytochrome oxidase) regions. This is
   attributed to species-specific differences between H. virescens mtDNA
   and H. subflexa mtDNA carried by the backcross. Therefore, mtDNA
   provides a convenient marker for tracking the progress of backcross
   sterility. Developmental stages from eggs through adults are suitable
   for use.}},

Abstract = {{Recurring mortalities of hatchery reared juvenile oysters in the
   Damariscotta River, Maine, caused by juvenile oyster disease (JOD),
   prompted a monitoring program to track growth and survival of juvenile
   eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, during the summer of 1993. Three
   cohorts of oysters ranging in initial mean shell height from 12.1 to
   25.9 mm were deployed on July 16 in growout trays adjacent to a
   commercial shellfish nursery operation. Mortalities commenced August 18
   and continued beyond September 21, 1993 in all three cohorts. Dying
   oysters displayed cupping of the left valve, unequal shell growth with
   the left valve outgrowing the right, tissue emaciation, mantle
   retraction and conchiolin deposition on the inner shell surfaces.
   Cumulative mortality was highly correlated to mean cohort size (shell
   height). The smallest size class (Cohort 3) suffered the highest
   cumulative mortality (56.2\%); the largest size class (Cohort 1)
   experienced relatively low cumulative mortality (13.6\%). The results of
   this study suggest that the impacts of JOD can be minimized by attaining
   mean shell height of >25 mm prior to mid-July (requires early spawning)
   or by deploying seed after mid-August (requires overwintering).}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that larger egg and hatchling sizes in the
   snapping turtle confer posthatching advantages, by comparing the growth
   rates and survival of hatchlings from different thermal and hydric
   environments during embryonic development. We also tested for
   sex-specific differences in survival and growth, two indices of
   hatchling fitness, as predicted by the Charnov \& Bull (1977) model of
   environmental sex determination (ESD). In addition, we examined
   interclutch and interpopulation variability in the responses of embryos
   and hatchlings to incubation conditions. Eggs of 21 clutches from four
   Ontario populations were incubated at 22.0, 25.5 or 29.3 degrees C in a
   dry(-350 kPa) or wet (-150 kPa) vermiculite substrate, and hatchling
   survival and growth in the laboratory were monitored for 11 months.
   Initial egg mass and substrate moisture were positively correlated with
   mass at hatching, but did not affect hatching success, posthatching
   growth or posthatching survival. Initially heavier hatchlings were more
   likely to survive, but did not grow more quickly. The effects of
   incubation environment and hatchling mass were not consistent among
   clutches or populations. Intermediate incubation temperatures produced
   mostly males, with higher embryo and hatchling survival, as well as
   posthatching growth, than the mostly females from the extreme
   temperatures. These results support the Charnov-Bull model. Embryo and
   hatchling mortality and deformities were higher in clutches from two
   populations which are contaminated with organochlorine toxins.
   Interclutch differences were significant for all variables, even when
   initial egg or hatchling sizes were considered. Hatchlings from the
   population near the northern limit of the species' range grew the
   slowest. These results indicate that hatchling size cannot be used as an
   index of hatchling quality or posthatching success, unless interclutch
   and interpopulation variation are taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Isolates of Phylophthora infestans from five U.S. states (California,
   Florida, New York, Washington, and Wisconsin) and one Canadian province
   (British Columbia) collected between October 1987 and October 1991 were
   analyzed for mating type and for genetic variation at two allozyme loci.
   A subset of these 155 isolates, which included all of the allozyme
   genotypes plus 26 isolates from our culture collection that had been
   collected in the United States and Canada during 1979-1987, were
   analyzed for DNA fingerprint variation. These analyses revealed 18
   genotypes among the 120 isolates that were analyzed for all markers. One
   genotype (US-1), which occurred in New York and Wisconsin in 1987 and
   1991, respectively, and also in older isolates dating back to 1979, has
   been found throughout the world and may have persisted asexually in the
   United States and Canada since the first reports of late blight disease
   in the 1840s. Four other genotypes that appeared to be members of the
   same clonal lineage were variants of US-1. The most common genotype in
   the collections from 1987 to 1991, US-6, was identical to previously
   characterized isolates from northwestern Mexico, so it was probably a
   recent migrant. Five additional genotypes were variants of US-6 and
   differed from it by a single allozyme or DNA fingerprint allele; thus,
   they were probably members of a single clonal lineage. Overall, 13 of
   the 18 genotypes identified in isolates collected during 1979-1991 could
   have resulted from two probable migration events. Only two isolates
   (1.3\% of the total sample) from a single field in British Columbia in
   1991 were A2, and these also were probably introduced recently from
   Mexico. Each field sampled appeared to have been colonized by a single
   clonal lineage. Therefore, future surveys in the United States and
   Canada can be accomplished most efficiently by sampling only a low
   number of isolates per field but increasing the number of fields
   sampled. These data provide a baseline for monitoring future genetic
   changes in populations of P. infestans in the United States and Canada.}},

Title = {{INTERFERENCE EFFECTS OF THE INVASIVE PLANT CARDUUS-NUTANS L AGAINST THE
   NITROGEN-FIXATION ABILITY OF TRIFOLIUM-REPENS L}},
Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},

Volume = {{163}},

Abstract = {{Carduus nutans L. is an invasive pasture/grassland species which may
   undergo rapid population growth through positive feedback. Plants of C.
   nutans produce a vegetative rosette, and after several months produce
   stems containing flower-heads, during which time the rosette leaves die
   and decompose. We investigated the influence of C. nutans on the
   nitrogen-fixation ability of Trifolium repens L. in three experiments.
   The first experiment was set up in a `'mixture'' design, and
   demonstrated that seedlings of T. repens were more susceptible to
   competition with other T. repens seedlings than to C. nutans seedlings.
   Nodule numbers and acetylene reduction per unit root, and acetylene
   reduction per unit nodules were adversely affected by increasing T.
   repens, but not C. nutans densities. The second experiment was of an
   additive design, with separate partitions to isolate above-ground and
   belowground interference. Flowering C. nutans plants strongly inhibited
   T. repens root growth, nodulation and acetylene reduction, but usually
   only when shoot interference was permitted. This appears to be due to
   decomposition of rosette leaves, which was maximal at this stage. The
   third experiment involved monitoring effects of tagged C. nutans
   individuals against T. repens in the field. This experiment showed that
   acetylene reduction was severely influenced by flowering C. nutans (when
   rosette leaves were decomposing), even when only mild reduction of T.
   repens growth was observed, and these effects persisted for some months
   after the C. nutans plants had died. The results of these experiments in
   combination suggest that decomposing rosette leaves have a strong
   potential to inhibit T. repens nitrogen fixation. It appears that
   allelopathy is involved, since alternative explanations (e.g. root
   competition by C. nutans; effects of C. nutans on soil moisture,
   microbial nutrient immobilisation and light availability; facilitation
   of herbivores by C. nutans) can be effectively discounted. Although
   invasive species are often assumed to be associated with soil nitrogen
   build-up, we believe that some invasive species such as C. nutans have
   the potential to induce long-term decline of soil nitrogen input.}},

Abstract = {{Pathotypes of Erysiphe graminis f.sp. hordei were monitored at
   fortnightly intervals in pure and mixed stands of spring barley during
   the course of mildew epidemics in two field trials. Mixtures were
   composed of cultivars with Arabische (gene Mla12), Laevigatum (MI(La)),
   and Monte Cristo (Mla9) resistance, respectively. The three-way mixtures
   were either random or, in 1989, laid out as one-row mixtures (i.e.,
   regularly alternating rows of different genotypes) or three-row mixtures
   (i.e., regularly alternating three-row strips of different genotypes),
   respectively. In 1990 only random mixtures and six-row mixtures were
   compared with pure stands. The virulence complexity (i.e., the average
   number of virulence factors per isolate with reference to Mla12, MI(La),
   and Mla9) was always maximal in the random mixtures. In 1989, linear
   regression of complexity on mildew generations gave significant b-values
   (slopes) of 0.049, 0.031, and 0.025 in the random mixture, one-row
   mixture, and three-row mixture, respectively; the b-value from pure
   stands was not significant. In 1990, another sampling technique allowed
   selection to be observed on each genotype in the mixtures separately. In
   the random mixture b-values were 0. 048, 0.064 and 0.017 (not
   significant) on Mla12, MI(La), and Mla9 cultivars respectively. In
   six-row mixtures and in pure stands, there was no significant increase
   in complexity (b > 0) on any of the mixture components. Although the
   frequency and relative fitness of complex pathotypes were higher in all
   types of mixtures than in pure stands, selection towards complex races
   was much less intense in row mixtures than in random mixtures in both
   field trials.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypical alterations observed in rolB-transformed plants have been
   proposed to result from a rise in intracellular free auxin due to a
   RolB-catalyzed hydrolysis of auxin conjugates (J.J. Estruch, J. Schell,
   A. Spena {[}1991] EMBO J 10: 3125-3128). We have investigated this
   hypothesis in detail using tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mesophyll
   protoplasts isolated from plants transformed with the rolB gene under
   the control of its own promoter (BBGUS 6 clone) or the cauliflower
   mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMVBT 3 clone). Protoplasts expressing rolB
   showed an increased sensitivity to the auxin-induced hyperpolarization
   of the plasma membrane when triggered with exogenous auxin. Because this
   phenotypical trait was homogeneously displayed over the entire
   population, protoplasts were judged to be a more reliable test system
   than the tissue fragments used in previous studies to monitor rolB gene
   effects on cellular auxin levels. Accumulation of free
   1-{[}H-3]naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) was equivalent in CaMVBT 3, BBGUS
   6, and wild-type protoplasts. Naphthyl-beta-glucose ester, the major NAA
   metabolite in protoplasts, reached similar levels in CaMVBT 3 and normal
   protoplasts and was hydrolyzed at the same rate in BBGUS 6 and normal
   protoplasts. Furthermore, NAA accumulation and metabolism in BBGUS 6
   protoplasts were independent of the rolS gene expression level.
   Essentially similar results were obtained with indoleacetic acid. Thus,
   it was concluded that the rolB-dependent behavior of transgenic tobacco
   protoplasts is not a consequence of modifying the intracellular auxin
   concentration but likely results from changes in the auxin perception
   pathway.}},

   1991 were used to monitor vegetation in the border region between
   Enontekio municipality, Finland, and Kautokeino municipality, Norway. A
   supervised classification on the red wave length channel was undertaken
   using training areas for maximum likelihood classifier to produce seven
   spectral land cover classes. The classification revealed great
   differences in vegetation between Finland and Norway. The largest
   difference was the lack of Cladinalichens on the Finnish side of the
   border. The area on the Finnish side is used for grazing all year round,
   while the area on the Norwegian side is a winter range only. According
   to official data for the local reindeer population, the average annual
   grazing pressure (head/area/time) is higher on the Norwegian side of the
   reindeer fence. The Finnish grazing practice is believed to have a
   detrimental impact on the vegetation, and has lead to pasture land
   degradation.}},

Abstract = {{NOAA-AVHRR satellite data have been used for a multi-year analysis of
   the seasonal variation of snow cover on the peninsula of Jameson Land
   located from 70-degrees 30'N to 72-degrees-N on the eastern coast of
   Greenland. Monitoring programmes for muskoxen and geese populations in
   Jameson Land were started in the early 1980s to assess the impact of oil
   exploration in the area. This study was conducted to provide snow cover
   data to the wildlife monitoring programmes because snow cover is an
   important factor which can affect the numbers and distribution of
   muskoxen and other wildlife in the area. Snow cover mapping is based on
   the geometric correction and radiometric calibration of each satellite
   scene before the visual bands are corrected for the terrain-effects and
   high solar zenith angle by using a simple radiation model. The
   atmospheric effect on the thermal infrared bands is corrected by using
   the `'split-window'' method. An automatic filtering routine with
   empirically determined thresholds is used to determine cloud- and
   haze-covered areas before the snow cover is computed from a linear
   expression using albedos of bare ground and full snow cover. By
   combining the satellite information with ground measurements and a
   digital terrain model, both the spatial distribution of snow cover and
   the total snow coveT depletion can be obtained.
   The method makes it possible to analyse the variation in regional and
   seasonal snow cover in wildlife habitats. The variation in snow cover
   depletion has been analysed in five subareas in the muskox area, and the
   results indicate that the snow cover pattern is an important factor
   which influences muskox calf crop and regional distribution of the
   muskox population. The method has proved useful for monitoring the
   duration of snow cover, and its application ought to facilitate the
   future study of wildlife habitats in extensive alpine and arctic areas.}},

Abstract = {{In this report we describe the use of five oligonucleotide probes,
   namely (GATA)(4), (GACA)(4), (GGAT)(4), (GAA)(6) and (CAC)(5), to reveal
   highly polymorphic DNA regions in rice. With each of the oligonucleotide
   probes, the level of polymorphism was high enough to distinguish several
   rice genotypes. Moreover, individual plants of one cultivar showed the
   same cultivar-specific DNA fingerprint. The multilocus fingerprint
   patterns were somatically stable. Our study demonstrates that
   microsatellite-derived DNA fingerprints are ideally suited for the
   identification of rice genotypes. As the majority of the probes detected
   a high level of polymorphism, they can be very useful in monitoring and
   aiding gene introgression from wild rice into cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{The succession of the microbial population depending on mean cellular

   studied.
   Three facilities were studied for a 1 year period. Microorganisms
   (protozoa, small metazoa and filamentous microorganisms) were counted
   using an optical microscope, specifically determining ciliated protozoa.
   A mathematical model is proposed for MCRT and the comparison between the
   experimental results and those predicted by the proposed model reveals
   that there is a difference between: (1) the succession of protozoa
   during the start up of a plant and (2) the succession due to variations
   in MCRT variation in the normal functioning of the plant. Although
   variations in protozoan population depend on mean cellular retention
   time in the short term (less than a week) they also depend on the
   protozoan species present. In the long run (several weeks), ciliated
   protozoan community coincides according to the MCRT in the three plants
   studied.
   The characterization of the fauna for each range of MCRT on the basis of
   the proposed model allows plant operation to be monitored by microscopic

Abstract = {{Populations of the freshwater mussel Hyridella menziesi were compared
   from six lakes and one river site along the Waikato River system, North
   Island, New Zealand, Estimated densities ranged from several hundred per
   square metre in Lake Taupo to less than one per square metre in Lake
   Karapiro. Length-frequencies were similar at all sites, with unimodal
   distributions and a notable absence of any individuals less than 20 mm
   long. The extent of shell erosion varied from sites where most mussels
   had less than 1\% of the right valve affected (i.e., Ohakuri \&
   Karapiro), to Lake Aratiatia where most shells had erosion over 1-20\%
   of their surface. Taupo and Ohakuri mussels showed an unusually high
   incidence (over 50\%) of internal shell abnormalities (including
   dulling, deformities and protuberances). Canonical discrimination based
   on shell length, height, width and weight clearly separated Taupo and
   Ohakuri mussels from all other sites, and ANCOVA on morphological
   characteristics confirmed significant differences between sites.
   Physical condition indices (based on dry flesh weight per shell weight
   and shell volume) showed an increasing downstream trend, but this was
   not significantly correlated with food availability (i.e., chlorophyll a
   concentration) because of unexpectedly low condition in lakes Ohakuri
   and Karapiro. Length v. age relationships contained considerable scatter
   and did not show between-site differences. Measured differences in
   external erosion, internal shell abnormalities and morphology were
   attributed to physical, chemical and biological factors. Use of mussels
   for environmental monitoring must take these `background' differences
   into account.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effects of the construction of a storm surge barrier in
   the Oosterschelde, long-term patterns (1979-89) in abundance and biomass
   of the intertidal macrozoobenthos were studied at 14 permanent stations.
   Additionally, data of a large-scale survey in late summer 1985 and 1989
   were analysed. In this paper, patterns in general parameters are
   discussed.
   Late summer values of total biomass, total density, species richness,
   diversity and abundance- and biomass ratio show no overall significant
   trend during the study period. The changes in the hydrodynamics and the
   morphology of the Oosterschelde after the completion of the storm surge
   barrier do not seem to have influenced the normal patterns in benthic
   populations. The observed patterns are determined by the occurrence of
   severe versus mild winters, rather than by hydrodynamic changes caused
   by the construction of the barrier. Low biomasses, high densities
   (particularly of opportunistic species) and higher `'stress-values''
   (abundance- and biomass ratio) in 1985(-87) indicate a temporal
   disturbance by severe winter weather. At the elevated COST-station 27,
   total biomass decreased sharply in 1985, due to a short-term increase in
   exposure time, caused by the manipulation of the storm surge barrier.}},

Abstract = {{To select an exposure monitoring protocol for assessing the occupational
   risks of fungicides in the lumber industry, the main strategies for
   determining exposures for risk assessment were reviewed. A survey of
   lumber industry work sites using fungicides observed the methods of
   application and opportunities for exposure. In addition, a review-of
   existing measurement data was done. These investigations indicated that
   fungicide application techniques and process locations were varied from
   site to site, such that it would be extremely difficult to select a few
   representative locations for quasi-experimental studies, as is usually
   done in agricultural pesticide exposure assessment. Existing measurement
   data mainly describe exposures to fungicides no longer in use, and do
   not cover the range of application techniques or process technology
   observed in the survey. A probability sample of the exposed population
   was therefore proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a wealth of information on the growth and population dynamics of
   sub-adult and adult Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus), there is
   far less information about younger juveniles under natural conditions. 
   Here we describe growth and population dynamics of juvenile spiny
   lobsters (12-68 mm carapace length, CL) that we have studied for 14
   months (October 1988-December 1989) using mark-recapture techniques in a
   hardbottom community in Florida Bay, Florida.  We also monitored the
   supply of postlarvae into the region in 1988 and 1989 using Witham-type
   surface collectors in an effort to link peak periods of settlement of
   postlarvae with subsequent cohorts of juveniles.  Field estimates of
   growth were the highest ever reported for this species, averaging 0.95
   mm CL.wk-1 (range:  0.35-1.25 mm CL.wk-1 for individuals 20-25 mm CL and
   40-45 mm CL, respectively).  These results indicate that lobsters in
   some areas in Florida Bay can reach Florida's legal harvestable size (76
   mm CL) 1.5 years after settlement.  Season and lobster size had
   significant effects on growth rates; slower growth occurred during the
   winter and among small individuals.  Differences in growth among size
   classes resulted from changes in molt increment, whereas seasonal
   differences were a result of changes in intermolt interval.  Using
   mark-recapture techniques, we estimate that the density of juvenile
   spiny lobsters <45 mm CL in this prime nursery habitat was 454.ha-1,
   that the mean monthly probability of survival (reflecting actual
   mortality plus emigration) was 0.51, and that an average of 131 lobsters
   entered the population through recruitment and immigration each month. 
   Recruitment of juveniles was significantly correlated (r = 0.83) with
   the supply of postlarvae to the region 8 months earlier.  This
   relationship is stronger than was previously believed, and may only be
   manifested in areas with superior nursery habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Population densities and recruitment of Diadema antillarum were
   monitored on reefs of the Florida Keys beginning in 1990/1991.  Signs of
   a mortality event, with symptoms similar to the 1983/1984 mass
   mortality, were first observed at off shore reefs near the Middle Keys
   in January/February, 1991.  The mortality event occurred on the offshore
   reefs off Key West in April 1991, reducing densities, which ranged from
   0.02-0.60.m-2, by 97\%.  Size frequency distribution shifted from one
   dominated by large individuals to one dominated by small recruits. 
   Between fall of 1991 and fall of 1992, abundance declined by 83\% at a
   patch reef offshore of Long Key.  The cause of this decline was unknown.
   During 1991 and 1992, densities on spur and groove reefs at Sombrero Key
   Reef, near the Middle Keys, and Molasses Reef, near the Upper Keys were
   less than 0.01.m-2.  Settlement on the reef-flat at Molasses Reef was
   higher in 1991 than 1992.  The settlement that occurred at Molasses Reef
   in 1991 was also detected on reefs off Long Key and Key West.  Following
   this settlement, densities of sea urchins did not increase at any of the
   study reefs.  Low adult densities, low recruitment and the chronic
   occurrence of mortality events in the Florida Keys indicate it is
   possible that densities of D. antillarum will never regain pre-mass
   mortality levels.}},

Abstract = {{Previously developed models and available limnological data were used to
   predict (i) absence or presence, (ii) categorical population density,
   and (iii) numerical abundance of Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) for
   194 inland Wisconsin lakes. A geographical information system (GIS) was
   used to test for associations between predicted lake population density
   classes and three landscape-scale characteristics (surficial deposits,
   bedrock type, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency developed ecoregions)
   that may affect limnological parameters. Although the models used
   differed in their predictions of specific lakes that would support
   Dreissena, the overall spatial distribution of lakes within a given
   density class was similar among the models. A significant association
   was found between each landscape-scale characteristic and Dreissena
   density classes. This study suggests that (1) available lake monitoring
   data can be used to predict Dreissena density for groups of inland
   lakes, (2) more information on North American lakes with zebra mussel is
   required to reduce the uncertainty of the models, and (3) spatial
   analysis using GIS methods can provide overall insight into the overall
   patterns of the potential spatial distribution of Dreissena.}},

   from 4- and 12-year-old hedges were analyzed periodically for frost
   hardiness between September 1991 and May 1992. The plantations were at
   different elevations and latitudes, and seedlings and stecklings of
   three geographically diverse populations were represented. Frost
   hardiness was assessed using the freeze-induced electrolyte leakage
   method on upper, primary branches. Air temperature at the low elevation
   sites was monitored. Frost hardiness of all plants increased from
   September to the end of January, and then decreased. Plants grown at
   high elevation were consistently more hardy than those grown at low
   elevation; however, no obvious differences in hardiness between the two
   latitudes were evident. Seedlings and stecklings of parents from certain
   families and populations developed greater hardiness than stock of
   parents from other areas, showing that frost hardiness of yellow-cedar
   plants has a genetic component. The three stock types did not show any
   consistent, significant differences in hardiness; however, stecklings
   from 12- and 4-year-old hedges were, on average, slightly more hardy
   than seedlings.}},

   rates were determined for the Porcupine caribou herd (Rangifer tarandus
   granti) in northeastern Alaska and northwestern Canada between 1983 and
   1992. The herd increased at an annual rate of r = 0.0467 between
   censuses in July 1983 (n = 135 000), July 1987 (n = 165 000), and July
   1989 (n = 178 000). The mean parturition rate for 225 radio-collared
   cows aged greater than or equal to 3 years monitored for 603
   reproductive attempts between 1982 and 1992 was 80\% and did not differ
   among years. First-year survival of calves was 51\%. The survival rate
   of calves through their first month differed among years (range
   57-90\%). The mean annual survival rate for greater than or equal to
   3-year-old caribou was 84.2\% for 225 females and 82.6\% for 42 males.
   Hunting mortality for the herd averaged 2-3\% annually. Population
   estimates generated by a computer model using parturition and survival
   rates for the herd closely tracked population trends determined from
   photocensus data. Growth of the herd is most sensitive to the survival
   of females 3 years of age and older, followed by calf production and
   survival.}},

Abstract = {{I tested three hypotheses that could explain variation in the timing of
   breeding in populations of House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) at four sites
   in Costa Rica. The sites were located at 200-1,500 m elevation on both
   sides and on top of the central mountain range, and had climates
   differing in temperature, the severity of the dry season, and total
   rainfall. For the first hypothesis, that breeding is timed to coincide
   with peaks in food availability, I monitored the monthly abundance of
   arthropod prey and wren clutch initiations at the four sites.
   Cross-correlation analysis showed that at three sites, wrens initiated
   clutches several months prior to when prey levels were high. Indeed,
   breeding began when prey levels were at their annual low. At the fourth
   site, prey levels varied little throughout the year and House Wrens
   nested nearly year round. These results indicate that sufficient food to
   produce eggs or feed nestlings may have been available throughout the
   year. Breeding appeared to be timed so that juvenile dispersal and molt
   occurred when food was most plentiful. The second hypothesis, that
   breeding is timed to avoid seasons when nest predation is high, was not
   supported because the rate of nest predation did not vary temporally.
   The third hypothesis, that breeding is timed to avoid climatic events
   that can increase the physiological costs of reproduction, was not
   supported at the three lower elevation sites. Clutch initiation at the
   highest site, however, did not commence until the early dry season wind
   and mist subsided. The termination of breeding was not correlated with
   climatic changes at any of the sites. Thus reproduction in tropical
   House Wrens seems generally to be timed to facilitate post-breeding
   activities, not activities associated with nesting itself.}},

Abstract = {{I studied tactics used by males to detect fertile females and achieve
   forced extra-pair copulations (FEPC) and female responses to FEPCs in a
   non-migratory, asynchronously breeding population of White-cheeked
   Pintails (Anas bahamensis) in the Bahamas. Males assessed female
   reproductive status by (1) monitoring behavior of neighboring pairs, (2)
   visiting the island nesting site and observing laying females directly,
   and (3) chasing females. FEPC attempts directed at neighboring females
   were more likely to occur during the female's fertile period than FEPC
   attempts directed at non-neighbors and a large proportion (44\%) of FEPC
   attempts involved neighboring pairs. Sexual chases of fertile females
   were more frequent and of longer duration than chases of non-fertile
   females suggesting that males gain information on female reproductive
   status in initial chases. Males employed sophisticated tactics to
   achieve FEPCs, including waylaying females as they left their nests.
   approaching females surreptitiously by swimming `'submarine'' style, and
   capturing and mounting females underwater. Females vigorously resisted
   FEPC attempts by repeatedly diving, flying away and hiding and were
   sometimes chased to exhaustion. The high costs of resistance and
   observations that females resisted copulations from all extra-pair
   males, regardless of quality, make `'resistance-as-a-ploy'' and
   `'genetic-quality'' hypotheses unlikely explanations for why females
   resist EPCs. I argue that females resist EPCs to preserve the pairbond
   and investments of their mates, which in turn protects their investment.}},

Abstract = {{In subtropical dry forest (Chaco Serrano) of Tucuman province,
   northwestem Argentina, we assessed responses of the flower-visitor
   assemblage to habitat fragmentation by monitoring insect visits to two
   spring-flowering tree species and by sampling insects with yellow pan
   traps. Each of four study sites contained a tract of continuous forest,
   one large (> 2.2 ha) forest fragment, and one small (< 1 ha) fragment,
   with fragments isolated for 5-20 yr preceding the study. During its
   respective flowering peak each tree species examined, Prosopis nigra
   (Mimosoideae) and Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), dominated the
   sites' entomophilous flora.
   Results indicate that flower-visitor assemblages respond to landscape
   features on the scale of hectares; specifically, forest fragmentation in
   the Chaco Serrano leads to an insect flower-visitor fauna increasingly
   dominated by the exotic honey bee (Apis mellifera). Bees as a group made
   >90\% of observed flower visits to both plant species. The honey bee
   alone made 82\% of all visits to the early-flowering tree species P.
   nigra and 44\% to the later flowering C australe. Frequency and taxon
   richness of native flower-visitors at both plant species declined with
   decreasing forest-fragment size, but frequency of honey bee visits
   tended to increase in complementary fashion, such that the total
   frequency of insect visits to flowers of either plant species varied
   little with fragment size. Frequencies of visits by honey bees and those
   by native insects were also negatively correlated across individual
   trees. In both plants, visits by native insects were most consistent
   (varied the least among plants or over time) in large forest tracts,
   whereas honey bee visits to C australe were most consistent in small
   fragments. In pan trap samples the relative frequency of honey bees
   increased with decreasing fragment size. Native flower-visitors sampled
   by pan traps increased in numbers and taxon richness both with
   increasing patch size and as spring progressed. Thus, fragmentation of
   the Chaco Serrano appears to (a) affect native flower-visitors adversely
   and to (b) facilitate honey bees' access to floral resources. It is not
   clear that these two effects are directly related to each other,
   however.}},

Abstract = {{1. We examined the effects of variation in the timing of spring leaf
   production and autumn leaf fall on the survival, mortality and abundance
   of Cameraria hamadryadella on Quercus alba and Q.macrocarpa.
   2. We monitored and manipulated the timing of foliation on field and
   potted Q.alba trees and observed the abundance of C.hamadryadella on
   those trees. We also monitored and manipulated the timing of leaf fall
   on Q.alba and Q.macrocarpa trees in the field and observed its effects
   on survival, mortality and abundance of C.hamadryadella.
   3. Variation in the timing of spring leaf production has no effect on
   C.hamadryadella abundance. However, a warm winter and spring in 1991 led
   to accelerated development and the imposition of a facultative third
   generation in one out of ten years of observation.
   4. In 1989, leaves fell relatively early and leaf fall in the autumn
   accounted for more than 50\% of the mortality of C.hamadryadella. In
   1990 and 1991 leaves fell relatively late and leaf fall induced
   mortality was substantially reduced and over-winter survival was
   markedly increased.
   5. The abundance of C.hamadrvadella remained constant in the spring and
   summer of 1990 following the previous autumn's relatively early leaf
   fall, but increased by 10-fold in the spring of 1991 following the
   relatively late leaf fall of autumn 1990. The abundance of
   C.hamadrvadella also increased 4-fold between the summer of 1991 and the
   spring of 1992 after another autumn of relatively late leaf fall. We
   attribute these increases in abundance in part to reduced mortality
   because of later leaf fall.
   6. Variation in the timing of autumn leaf fall may be responsible for
   initiating outbreaks of C.hamadryadella.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between the bark beetle Ips typographus and one of its
   predators, Thanasimus formicarius, were investigated in caged spruce
   logs containing both species in eight different density combinations.
   Productively (offspring per female) of Ips was adversely affected by
   high Ips gallery density as well as high Thanasimus density. Thanasimus
   productivity was enhanced by high Ips gallery density but negatively
   affected by high Thanasimus density. Ips productivity and Thanasimus
   developmental rate differed between tree individuals, probably owing to
   tree-related differences in phloem thickness. Relative predator-caused
   Ips mortality was ca 20\% higher at high gallery density (ca 300 egg
   galeries per m(2)) than at low gallery density (ca 100 egg galleries per
   m(2)), indicating that mortality was density dependent. This difference
   was due to the fact that Thanasimus larval density was positively
   related to Ips gallery density. Mortality increased by ca 0.4\% with
   each additional Thanasimus larva per m(2), independently of gallery
   density. Relative population levels of Ips and Thanasimus were monitored
   with pheromone traps in two regions differing in their Ips typographus
   outbreak history. Absolute catch as well as the Thanasimus/Ips catch
   ratio were ten times greater in the outbreak region than in the
   non-outbreak region. Coupled with the results in the caging experiment,
   this indicates that T. formicarius responds numerically to changes in I.
   typographus numbers per unit bark area as well as to Ips population
   changes at the regional level. The findings suggest that predation under
   bark may be a significant factor in supressing I. typographus outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{The design of environmental monitoring programs is frequently hampered
   by a lack of objective, quantitative criteria for evaluating alternative
   monitoring variables.  In this paper we describe two such criteria,
   which we call samples required - the number of samples required to
   detect a given change in value - and information imparted - the amount
   of environmental information revealed by the monitoring variable.  We
   then use these criteria to evaluate fin erosion in winter flounder
   (Pleuronectes americanus) and Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) as
   marine environmental monitoring variables.  Two methods for determining
   the samples required use contaminated and reference areas to estimate
   the sample statistics of a hypothetical impacted population.  The first
   method is based on the overall difference in the proportions of diseased
   fish in the reference and hypothetical populations.  The second treats
   the proportion of diseased fish in individual trawls as the variate and
   determines the samples required based on the mean and variance of the
   reference and contaminated populations.  We use both methods to predict
   the number of trawls needed to detect an increase of 200\% in fin
   erosion in the reference population.  The first method had greater
   statistical power but assumes spatially homogeneous populations.  The
   second method accounts for environmental patchiness.  For Dover sole it
   predicted 1661 trawls would be needed to detect the 200\% increase.  An
   estuarine winter flounder population would require 74 trawls, and an
   oceanic winter flounder population would require 142.5 trawls.  It
   appears that fin erosion in winter flounder may be a useful indicator of
   environmental contamination, but several stipulations apply.  Migration
   may inflate the number of diseased fish observed in the reference
   population, and a more detailed etiology of the disease is required,
   including an understanding of what contaminants are responsible for
   manifestation of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Great spruce bark beetle, Dendroctonus micans, first discovered in the
   UK in 1982, has been the subject of an integrated pest management (IPM)
   programme developed by the Forestry Commission. The programme is based
   on a combination of forest management practice, including sanitation
   felling and restriction of transport of infested spruce, and biological
   control through introduction, rearing and release of the exotic
   predatory beetle, Rhizophagus grandis. Five phases in the development of
   the IPM programme are recognised and described, although all are
   interrelated: (i) initial survey and sanitation felling reduced numbers
   below critical levels; (ii) initial forest management strategy was to
   introduce a scheduled area restricting movement of infested spruce to
   approved mills; (iii) introduction and release of R. grandis through an
   inoculative release strategy; (iv) refinements to forest management to
   reduce further accidental spread and to monitor natural spread of
   Dendroctonus micans; (v) assessment of the impact of R. grandis using a
   range of criteria. Populations of Dendroctonus micans are now at low
   levels and there is strong evidence that R. grandis has established
   well, is spreading and is an important factor in regulating the bark
   beetle populations.}},

Abstract = {{The elm leaf beetle (ELB) causes severe damage to California's elms. The
   goal was to develop a management system based on long-term population
   monitoring for decision making, and environmentally sound control
   methods. English and Siberian elms with ELB populations in 25 locations
   from the northeast to the central coast of California were sampled from
   1985 to 1990. Population monitoring has indicated that each ELB
   generation (two to three per season) varies unpredictably in its
   potential for causing foliage damage. Each generation needs to be
   sampled and decisions made for control measures most suitable for that
   generation. From the data base, we have developed a sampling system in
   which heat accumulation above 11-degrees-C at ELB sites, measured in
   degree-days, indicates when to sample and, if necessary, when to treat.
   Sampling elm branch terminals for the presence of ELB eggs during the
   limited time when egg laying is near its peak provides a cost-effective
   means of predicting foliage damage, and thus of deciding whether control
   actions are necessary. Two control options compatible with ELB natural
   enemies have been tested: trunk banding with Carbaryl and Bacillus
   thuringiensis foliar sprays. A number of strains of the egg parasitoid
   Tetrastichus gallerucae have been released and at least one strain has
   survived over winter. When the number of these parasitoids has increased
   sufficiently, either through same season releases or from overwintering
   survival, they have exerted substantial control.}},

   POPULATION RECOVERY IN WINTER-WHEAT}},

Abstract = {{1. The influence of plot size in assessing the impact of pesticide
   treatment on invertebrate populations in cereals was investigated.
   Within-field experiments were performed in southern England in winter
   wheat using the broad-spectrum aphicide dimethoate.
   2. Post-treatment recovery was monitored using, in separate experimental
   designs, pitfall traps in the centre of treated plots of different size
   from 4 x 4 m up to 288 x 288 m, and pitfall traps in transects running
   from the edge to the centre of large treated plots.
   3. Invertebrate population recovery was shown to be dependent on the
   size of the plot treated. Two contrasting patterns of recovery were
   identified: (A) recovery progressing from the edge to the centre of
   treated areas; (B) recovery most rapid in the centre of the large
   treated areas.
   4. Type A recovery was associated with the predatory groups Carabidae,
   Staphylinidae and Linyphiidae. It is consistent with that expected from
   the reinvasion of the pesticide-depleted plots from the undepleted
   surroundings. The speed of a group's recovery was shown to be a function
   of the invasion potential, which in turn was related to the mobility and
   phenology of the group.
   5. Type B recovery was associated with the prey groups Aphididae and
   Collembola. Predation pressure appears to be the dominant process in
   their post-treatment population recovery, with recovery most rapid in
   areas with the fewest predators.
   6. The results suggest that small-scale within-field pesticide
   evaluations would in many instances fail to predict the impact of
   treatment on a commercial scale.}},

Abstract = {{Depressions in the red to far-red ratio (R:FR) of solar radiation
   arising from the selective absorption of R (600-700 nm) and scattering
   of FR (700-800 nm) by chlorophyll within plant canopies may function as
   an environmental signal directly regulating axillary bud growth and
   subsequent ramet recruitment in clonal plants. We tested this hypothesis
   in the field within a single cohort of parental ramets in established
   clones of the perennial bunchgrass, Schizachyrium scoparium. The R:FR
   was modified near leaf sheaths and axillary buds at the bases of
   individual ramets throughout the photoperiod without increasing
   photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) by either (1) supplementing R
   beneath canopies to raise the naturally low R:FR or (2) supplementing FR
   beneath partially defoliated canopies to suppress the natural R:FR
   increase following defoliation. Treatment responses were assessed by
   simultaneously monitoring ramet recruitment, PPFD and the R:FR beneath
   individual clone canopies at biweekly intervals over a 12-week period.
   Neither supplemental R nor FR influenced the rate or magnitude of ramet
   recruitment despite the occurrence of ramet recruitment in all
   experimental clones. In contrast, defoliation with or without
   supplemental FR beneath clone canopies reduced ramet recruitment 88\% by
   the end of the experiment. The hypothesis stating that the R:FR signal
   directly regulates ramet recruitment is further weakened by evidence
   demonstrating that (1) the low R:FR-induced suppression of ramet
   recruitment is only one component of several architectural modifications
   exhibited by ramets in response to the R:FR signal (2) immature leaf
   blades, rather than leaf sheaths or buds, function as sites of R:FR
   perception on individual ramets, and (3) increases in the R:FR at clone
   bases following partial canopy removal are relatively transient and do
   not override the associated constraints on ramet recruitment resulting
   from defoliation. A depressed R:FR is probably of greater ecological
   significance as a signal of competition for light in vegetation canopies
   than as a density-dependent signal which directly regulates bud growth
   and ramet recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{A simple spatial model of the population dynamics of the agriculturally
   important spider Lepthyphantes tenuis (Blackwall) is described. The
   model was constructed to identify priority areas for further population
   dynamics research and to determine how populations may react to changes
   in agricultural practices. The model incorporates all present knowledge
   concerning reproduction, population growth and migration of this
   species.
   Simulations using the model suggest: The life-history strategy exhibited
   by this species allows it to survive in regularly perturbed systems;
   simultaneous destruction of local populations over a large contiguous
   area would not easily be ameliorated by re-colonisation by migrating
   spiders. In contrast population destruction on the same scale of
   mortality had little effect on the metapopulation if separated in space
   or time; relatively un-perturbed areas were found to be important
   sources for re-colonisation of agricultural habitats. The spatial scale
   at which populations are monitored should be relatively large to
   overcome any possible unpredictable changes in local populations as a
   result of spatial interactions caused by local habitat heterogeneity.}},

   July) whereas Serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), Wild Sarsaparilla (Aralia
   nudicaulis), Dogwood (Cornus stolonifera) and Raspberry (Rubus spp.)
   were the major fruit-bearing plants used in late summer (16 July to 31
   August).  Ants (Formicidae) were an important animal food throughout the
   summer.  Mature forest was the commonest habitat type in the study area.
   It was used in proportion to its availability during early summer even
   though it was the poorest food-producing habitat.  Clearcuts harboured
   the most fruit-bearing plants and were used predominantly in late
   summer.  In general, disturbed areas, either natural (insect epidemics)
   or man-made (clearcuts), were the preferred habitats during the study.

Abstract = {{The relationship between daily settlement rates and local concentrations
   of veligers of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, was investigated
   using plankton sampling and scouring pad collectors. A total of 102
   plankton and 136 collector samples were taken from a nearshore site near
   Wheatley, Ontario, in west-central Lake Erie, over 17 consecutive d in
   August 1992. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between daily
   settlement rates and daily concentrations of late-stage (competent)
   veligers in the water column (determined at shell lengths
   greater-than-or-equal-to 170 mum; r = 0.93-0.98; p < 0.001;
   log10-transformed data). Variations in settlement rates of 1-3 orders of
   magnitude occurred within 24-96 h. Results also suggest that
   wind-induced hydrodynamics can affect settlement rates of zebra mussel
   larvae; the period used to monitor settlement (24 h) was much shorter
   than that employed (approximately 1-2+ wk) in previous studies. Daily
   monitoring of concentrations of late-stage veligers in the water column
   as well as settlers (fibrous collectors) may help to identify biological
   and physical factors affecting short-term variability in settlement; it
   may also prove advantageous for industries where early detection of
   colonization by the zebra mussel is critical for cost-effective control
   of this invasive mollusc.}},

Abstract = {{A population of about 1500 chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) was monitored
   in the French Alps between 1985 and 1991 by observing individually
   marked animals. Data on resighting of marked females were analyzed using
   capture-recapture models. Resighting probabilities were time dependent
   and survival rates were age dependent. The annual survival rate was low
   in juveniles (0.58) and high in adults (0.96). Maturing animals (1.5-3.5
   years old) had lower survival rates (0.91) than adults. Older
   age-classes exhibited no significant decline in survival rates. Survival
   patterns are compared with those from a previous study in New Zealand,
   and biological and methodological differences between the two studies
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Movements of nonterritorial (''floater'') male red-winged blackbirds
   (Agelaius phoeniceus) were monitored to test the hypothesis that
   floaters enhance their chances for territory acquisition by becoming
   familiar with a specific area, i.e., by restricting their geographical
   movements and monitoring only a few occupied territories. Intensive
   observations from two separate study areas did not support the
   hypothesis. Only 8\% of the 410 males banded as floaters in an
   unmanipulated study area claimed territories or were ever recaptured on
   that study area, suggesting that floaters visited a very large number of
   territories. When territory owners were experimentally removed in a
   second study area, a greater proportion of floaters remained in the
   vicinity (29\% of 80 males), indicating that one proximate control of
   floater dispersal was the availability of vacancies. Radiotelemetry
   confirmed that floaters ranged widely. Floaters continued to disperse as
   they aged, and most floaters that acquired territories probably did so
   outside the study areas. These patterns of dispersal and territory
   acquisition suggest that familiarity with a small number of territories
   and their owners is not a better strategy than continual dispersal for
   most floater red-winged blackbirds in these populations. Once adulthood
   was reached, younger floaters were not less successful than older
   floaters at claiming vacancies. This, combined with the effects of
   mortality, results in the majority of floaters and the majority of new
   territory claimants being young adult males.}},

Abstract = {{Largely synchronous population fluctuations of Clethrionomys glareolus,
   C. rufocanus, and Microtus agrestis were monitored by snap-trapping in
   spring and autumn in 1971-1988 in a strongly seasonal environment near
   UmeA, northern Sweden. All species were cyclic in the sense that they
   showed fairly regular (3-4 yr) fluctuations, but amplitudes
   ((max)/n(min)) varied, averaging almost-equal-to 200-fold in each
   species. This conclusion was supported by autocorrelation and spectral
   analysis, and by fitting time series data to a model for
   phase-forgetting cycles. By contrast, data did not conform to a model
   for phase-remembering cycles (with fixed period and amplitude).
   The transition between cycles, i.e., from the low to increase phase, was
   characterized by a distinct shift in rate of change in numbers from low
   to high or markedly higher values both in summer and winter. Generally,
   rate of change in summer declined continuously from the increase phase
   through each cycle. Moreover, there was a similar decrease of rate of
   change in winter, although rate of change (mainly in C. rufocanus and M.
   agrestis) first frequently increased early in the cycle. Rate of change
   was delayed density dependent in all species both in summer and winter,
   as revealed by high negative correlations with density in previous
   autumn and spring for summer and winter changes, respectively. These new
   findings of delayed density dependence (DDD) support the suggestion that
   vole cycles are generated by a time-lag mechanism. Possible mechanisms
   of the DDD are discussed.
   Regression analyses of rate of change in the different voles suggest
   that, besides the strong dependence on previous density, rate of change
   in numbers was also affected by current seed supply (in C glareolus)
   and/or weather variables (temperature and precipitation sums) that may
   have affected the quantity or quality of food.}},

Abstract = {{The results of an experiment examining the effects of pulsed application
   of a pesticide, chlorpyrifos, in an outdoor replicated artificial stream
   system are described. Two levels of chlorpyrifos were used, 0.1 mu
   g.liter(-1) (low dose) and 5.0 mu g.liter(-1) (high dose), and applied:
   for 6 hr. Low-dose streams showed little impact from the treatment and
   were indistinguishable from control streams. Significant reductions in
   invertebrate density occurred in the high-dose streams and were mainly
   due to reductions in density of chironomid larvae. There were no
   significant reductions in taxon richness associated with the treatments
   indicating no. localized extinctions of species. Diversity measures were
   insensitive to the changes observed in the streams. Ordination and
   classification procedures were more illuminating and indicated that the
   major effect of pesticide application was to interfere with the normal
   pattern of community change occurring within the system. Recovery
   following treatment was rapid. The results are discussed with reference
   to the use of indicator species and biological monitoring strategies
   intended to identify human-mediated disturbance. (C) 1994 Academic

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted to examine distributional patterns of Bemisia
   tabaci (Gennadius) eggs and nymphs on two cultivars of upland cotton,
   Gossypium hirsutum L., and one American Pima cotton, G. barbadense L.,
   and to develop efficient sampling plans for estimating densities of
   immatures. On a per square centimeter basis, both eggs and nymphs were
   equally distributed among the four leaf sectors delineated by the major
   leaf veins. This pattern was independent of the nodal location of the
   leaf, cultivar, or sampling date. However, based on counts on 3.88-cm2
   disks near the petiole of the leaf, both egg and nymphal were aggregated
   at the proximal end of each sector. The relationship between disk and
   whole leaf counts varied with nodal position and cultivar. The greatest
   number of eggs and nymphs were found on mainstem leaves from nodes 2-4
   and 4-7 (mainstem terminal = node 1), respectively. This pattern changed
   slightly with time but was similar among the three cultivars. The lowest
   coefficients of variation were associated with leaf counts from nodes
   4-5 and 5-6 for eggs and nymphs, respectively. Based on variance
   partitioning and sampling cost analysis, a single 3.88-cm2 disk from the
   base of the second sector of the fifth mainstem node leaf was determined
   to be the most efficient sample unit for estimating egg and nymphal
   densities. Sequential sampling stop lines were calculated for this
   sample unit using Green's (1970) method. Sample plan validation using
   Monte Carlo simulation indicated that actual levels of precision
   (SEM/mean) were poorer than those specified at low densities of
   immatures and better than specified at high densities. Further
   simulations indicated that stop lines for specified precisions of 0.20,
   0.25, or 0.30 would maintain an average precision of 0.25 when egg or
   nymphal densities are <10, between 10 and 100, or >100 per leaf disk,
   respectively. These sampling plans allow efficient monitoring for pest
   management application and will aid the study of B. tabaci population
   dynamics in cotton.}},

Abstract = {{Renal function has been examined in a group of 77 subjects
   occupationally exposed to cadmium fume and dust, together with a
   referent group of 103 age- and socioeconomically matched subjects.
   Fourteen biochemical parameters were measured on each subject. Three
   different ways of combining the information from all 14 tests were used
   to identify those subjects with renal dysfunction. These were first to
   count the number of parameters in which a subject recorded an abnormal
   test result. Second, the z value was computed for each parameter for
   each person by comparison with the mean and standard deviation of a
   derived normal population; these z scores were then summed. Lastly a
   multivariate distance measure, Mahalanobis D-2, was determined for each
   subject from the distribution of normal subjects. The three approaches
   showed a considerable degree of agreement in identifying subjects with
   renal dysfunction, but they also displayed complementary strengths and
   weaknesses. The consensus of the three techniques was then taken to
   define truly dysfunctional subjects and each of the 14 parameters, and
   some combinations of pairs of parameters were tested as to their
   sensitivity and specificity. For this group of subjects, it was not
   possible to improve greatly on the use of retinol binding protein on its
   own. Were a second parameter to be chosen, it would be desirable to
   choose one reflecting the glomerular filtration rate, but the absence of
   a suitable sensitive biological monitoring parameter precludes a firm
   recommendation. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Asthma prevalence and mortality due to asthma have been increasing
   during the last decade, and both the rates and the increases in rates
   have been higher for blacks than whites and higher for children than
   adults. Whether environmental factors such as air pollution contribute
   to these increases is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine
   the relationship between emergency visits to a hospital for childhood
   asthma and exposure to ozone in an indigent, predominantly black
   population. Data were collected by abstracting clinical records for all
   children with asthma or reactive airway disease in one public hospital
   during the summer of 1990. From June 1, 1990, to August 31, 1990, 609
   visits were made by children aged 1 to 16 years to an emergency clinic
   for treatment of asthma or reactive airway disease. Monitoring data
   indicated that maximum ozone levels equalled or exceeded 0.11 ppm on 6
   days during the study period. The average number of visits for asthma or
   reactive airway disease was 37\% higher on the days after those 6 days
   (from 6:00 PM to 6:00 PM the next day) than on other days (95\% CI, RR =
   1.02-1.73). The results of the study suggest that among black children
   from low-income families, asthma may be exacerbated following periods of
   high ozone pollution. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Biological responses to inhaled acid sulfates result from the deposition
   of hydrogen ion (H+) on airway surfaces. Thus, effects from sulfuric
   acid and ammonium bisulfate, the two major ambient species, have been
   assumed to be the same for a given H+ concentration within the exposure
   atmosphere, assuming similar respiratory tract deposition patterns.
   However, recent inhalation studies have indicated that sulfuric acid is
   disproportionately potent compared to ammonium bisulfate when the H+
   content of the exposure atmosphere is considered, suggesting that some
   factors following inhalation affect the amount of H+ contacting airway
   surfaces. This study assessed a mechanism potentially underlying this
   phenomenon, namely, the extent of neutralization by respiratory tract
   ammonia. This was evaluated using a physical model system designed to
   mimic transit of these aerosols in the upper respiratory tract of the
   animal model used in this laboratory, the rabbit. The results suggest
   that for equal exposure quantities of H+, more acid would be deposited
   when sulfuric acid is inhaled than when ammonium bisulfate is inhaled.
   Furthermore, results from a series of in vitro exposures of tracheal
   epithelial cells to sulfuric acid and ammonium bisulfate aerosols
   indicated that the biological response is a function of the total mass
   (ionic) concentration of Ht deliverable to the cells or the total
   extractable Ht per particle. The results of this study have possible
   implications for ambient monitoring of particulate associated strong
   acidity, suggesting that it may be necessary to speciate such measures
   into the relative amounts of H+ as sulfuric acid or ammonium bisulfate
   in order to most accurately relate atmospheric acid levels to observed
   health effects. In addition, since much of the ambient
   particulate-associated Ht exists as sulfuric acid/ammonium bisulfate
   mixtures rather than pure compounds, H+-associated health effects from
   controlled exposure studies of sulfuric acid may not be transferable to
   ambient population situations on a 1:1 basis. Since any such errors in
   exposure assessment will necessarily bias downward the strength of
   Ht-related health effects associations found via epidemiological
   studies, failure to address the speciation of H+ may cause such studies
   to underestimate the human health effects of strong acids. (C) 1994

Abstract = {{The fishery for snakehead (Channa striata) in Sri Lanka was studied by
   monitoring the monthly catch from a large reservoir of 972 ha surface
   area and that of five closely situated smaller reservoirs of surface
   areas ranging from 37 to 265 ha for 18 months. The annual snakehead
   yield in the large reservoir was 1.76 kg ha-1 while that of smaller
   reservoirs was 7.08 kg ha-1. In all reservoirs, snakehead was only a
   by-catch of the tilapia fishery. The total annual C. striata yield in
   Sri Lanka is estimated to be over 317 t which is only about 0.8\% of the
   total reservoir fish production.
   The growth parameters asymptotic length (L(infinity)) and growth
   constant (K) of the snakehead populations, as determined by monthly
   size-frequency data, were respectively 60 cm total length and 0.40 for
   the large reservoir and 53 cm total length and 0.35 for the smaller
   reservoirs. The mean length of the ten largest individuals (L(max)), the
   mean length of the ten smallest individuals (L(min)), mean length at
   recruitment to the fishery (L' ) and mean size at first capture (Lc) of
   the two populations were respectively 51.6 cm, 26.6 cm, 37.5 cm, 42.5 cm
   for the large reservoir and 46.4 cm, 2.2 cm, 36.0 cm and 35.4 cm for the
   smaller reservoirs. The respective total, natural and fishing
   mortalities of the populations were 1.53, 0.84 and 0.69 in the large
   reservoir and 1.19, 0.77 and 0.42 in the smaller reservoirs. In all
   reservoirs, over 90\% of the catch consisted of third and fourth year
   fish.
   Spawning was observed in all months, but it was much more enhanced
   during and immediately following the major rainy season.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the main results of a monitoring study at Lake Myvatn,
   northern Iceland, begun in 1975. The aims were to find factors that
   limit production of young and cause changes in density of breeding ducks
   of several species. We estimated numbers of ducks in spring, before
   nesting, numbers of ducklings produced, and numbers moulting. Chironomid
   and simuliid dipterans were monitored with window traps. In all duck
   species studied, production of young was correlated with food abundance.
   Reproductive performance determined subsequent changes in spring
   population density of Eurasian Wigeon, Tufted Duck, Greater Scaup,
   Common Scoter and Harlequin Duck. The spring population of Barrow's
   Goldeneye apparently did not respond to variation in reproductive
   success. Moulting numbers of male Tufted Duck were related to chironomid
   abundance, but not those of Scaup and Barrow's Goldeneye. Moulting
   numbers were not associated with previous reproductive output.}},

Abstract = {{In the Great Lakes, the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) is a prominent
   member of the aquatic bird community, and has been used to monitor
   spatial and temporal trends in contaminant levels. To understand more
   fully contaminant loading outside the breeding season, we analysed the
   contents of 1298 freshly regurgitated pellets and 179 fresh faeces,
   collected in March and early April 1978-83, and between late December
   and late February 1990-91, from the vicinity of breeding colonies in
   Lakes Ontario and Erie, the Niagara River, Detroit River, and
   south-eastern parts of Lake Huron. Most adult Herring Gulls from the
   Great Lakes population winter in these areas, but there is no published
   account of their food habits other than during the breeding season. Most
   pellets from colonies close to large urban centres contained remains of
   garbage, as well as various fish species. Small mammals, notably Deer
   Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) dominated the early spring diet at Lake
   Huron colonies near agricultural areas. At all other sites fish
   predominated in pellets and faeces, but garbage items were also recorded
   regularly. The species of fish consumed varied regionally, probably
   reflecting local availability. In Lake Ontario, Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus
   mordax) and Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) occurred most frequently in
   samples, whereas Freshwater Drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) was the main
   fish prey in Lake Erie and the Detroit River. Dietary differences were
   apparent between years, within seasons, and amongst areas. While these
   may have reflected some real differences in food availability,
   interpretation of these results was confounded by various biases
   inherent in the sampling of pellets and faeces to determine diet in such
   an opportunistic species. Therefore, it would be unwise to draw rigid
   conclusions as to regional or seasonal differences in the diets of
   piscivorous birds, based upon analyses of diet from only a small sample
   of sites or years. Herring Gulls appear to feed mainly on fish and
   garbage in winter and early spring on the lower Great Lakes (much as
   during the breeding season), but any locally abundant food source is
   probably exploited opportunistically.}},

Abstract = {{Three species of loons nest in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, an area 80
   km north of Anchorage in southcentral Alaska. This is a region of
   intense change; its human population doubled between 1980-1990 to almost
   36000 people. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game through its Loon
   Watch Program has monitored 150 to 200 lakes since 1984, half of which
   are used by loons. Common loons (Gavia immer) nested on lakes of at
   least 12 ha while Pacific loons (G. pacifica) used lakes as small as 4
   ha. Red-throated loons (G. stellata) were found on even smaller ponds.
   On all waters used by reproductive loons, 89\% were connected to other
   water bodies, 62\% of the shore was appropriate for nesting and 85\% of
   the area was < 15 ft (4.6 m) deep. This littoral zone comprised habitat
   for three-spined stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), the dominant
   food source for loons, and supported large macrophyte beds that were
   used by loons as chick-rearing areas. The effect of human presence on
   summer loon distribution was dependent on the willingness of humans to
   accommodate to the needs of loons.}},

Abstract = {{The Sackville Waterfowl Park, contains a 19 hectare shallow freshwater
   wetland created by reflooding a saltwater marsh that was drained three
   centuries ago. Its primary purpose is to provide wetland habitat and
   wildlife viewing opportunities to tourists and residents. This newly
   created, eutrophic wetland supports high densities of waterfowl, 2.1 and
   3.3 brood ha-1 in 1991 and 1992 respectively. It is hoped that long term
   monitoring of the Park's waterfowl population and wetland habitat will
   contribute to a better understanding of factors controlling breeding
   waterfowl populations.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclodiene resistance has accounted for over 60\% of reported cases of
   insecticide resistance. Understanding of this resistance can therefore
   help us answer questions relating to the mechanism and origin of
   representative resistance-associated mutations, questions fundamental to
   the molecular and populations genetics of pesticide resistance. The
   cyclodiene resistance gene Rdl (resistance to dieldrin) was cloned from
   a mutant of the model insect Drosophila resistant to cyclodienes and
   picrotoxinin.; Rdl codes for a subunit of a novel class of GABA gated
   chloride ion channels and resistance is correlated with replacement of
   the same amino acid residue in a wide range of species from different
   insect orders. This single amino acid replacement Ala(302) > Ser, within
   the proposed lining of the chloride ion channel, also confers
   insensitivity to the blocking action of cyclodienes and picrotoxinin on
   GABA gated chloride ion channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The
   resistance mechanism involves both changes in cyclodiene binding site
   affinity and also a change in the rate of receptor desensitization which
   destabilizes the cyclodiene-favored conformation. Documentation of the
   resistance associated mutation has allowed for the design of a PCR based
   molecular monitoring technique. This technique gives more accurate
   estimates of resistance gene frequency from smaller sample sizes and has
   shown the frequency of resistance in apparently unselected populations
   of Drosophila to be as high as 1\%. We are still uncertain as to why
   resistance persists in the apparent absence of selection pressure and
   any severe reduction in the fitness of resistant strains, besides a
   paralytic phenotype at high temperature, remains undocumented.}},

Abstract = {{1. The relationships between female body mass (W(a)), litter size (m),
   juvenile growth rate (G) and mass at weaning (W20) were examined by
   monitoring natural litters in 29 greater white-toothed shrews, Crocidura
   russula (Hermann 1780). The trade-offs between m and G or W20 were
   further investigated by manipulating litter sizes: each of seven females
   reared four litters of 2, 4, 6 and 8 offspring.
   2. Offspring mass at weaning (W20) exhibited a large variance, most of
   which could be attributed (ANCOVA On manipulated litters) to two
   effects: a litter-size effect, and a female individual effect, referred
   to as `female quality'.
   3. Litter size explained 68\% of the variance in W20 among manipulated
   litters (linear regression). The limited milk supply was probably
   responsible for this effect, because litter size depressed growth rate
   during the first half of the lactation period (G1), but not during the
   weaning stage (G2).
   4. Among non-manipulated litters, litter size correlated positively with
   maternal body mass (W(a)), so that large females tended to produce small
   juveniles. This correlation between m and W(a) is seen as the result of
   a body-mass dependence in the cost of raising a litter of a given size,
   during either pregnancy or lactation.
   5. Differences in `female quality' explained 16\% of the variance in W20
   among manipulated litters. This factor did not affect G1 and may thus
   relate to differences among offspring of different females in their
   rates of processing milk and/or external food during late lactation.
   6. `Female quality' was independent of both body mass and litter size:
   larger females did not produce larger offspring when controlled for
   litter size, while higher-quality females did not produce larger
   litters.
   7. Our results support the hypothesis that most variance in adult and
   juvenile body masses is non-genetic, and stems from the trade-off
   between litter size and offspring size.}},

Abstract = {{A bioassay in which azinphosmethyl was incorporated into the adhesive of
   a sex pheromone trap was developed to detect resistance in populations
   of male codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). Experiments were done to
   evaluate the influence of the length of the bioassay, moth body position
   in the adhesive, moth age, and extremes of temperature and relative
   humidity (RH) experienced by moths caught in traps in the field. Moth's
   body position and age for moths <5 d old were not significant factors
   affecting moth mortality. Exposure to low humidity (45\% RH) or low to
   high temperature (10-20-degrees-C) for up to 12 h did not significantly
   affect mortality. Forty-eight populations were surveyed in Washington,
   and three populations were surveyed in Utah during 1991-1992 with a
   discriminating concentration, 75 mug (AI)/g adhesive; moth mortality was
   scored after 64 h at 20-degrees-C and >85\% RH. Populations from
   crabapple plantings, certified-organic, abandoned, and conventional
   orchards were sampled. Twenty of 44 populations monitored in 1991 and 12
   of 17 populations monitored in 1992 had significant levels of resistance
   compared with a susceptible laboratory strain based on nonoverlapping
   95\% CL. All but one of these resistant populations were from current
   conventional or recently abandoned conventional orchards. Results from
   the 10 orchards sampled in both years were not significantly different.
   Resistance in a population collected in 1991 reverted rapidly when
   removed from exposure to azinphosmethyl and reared on apple in the
   laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the presence of the Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella
   (Hubner), on the capture of the almond moth, Cadra cautella (Walker), in
   pheromone-baited traps was evaluated. It was found that when both sexes
   of each species were released into a large warehouse simultaneously, the
   capture of male C. cautella was reduced to 5.5 +/- 0.8 in traps baited
   with a two-component lure as compared to 11.4 +/- 2.2 when only C.
   cautella were released. This decrease in response may have been caused
   by an inhibitory substance produced by the female P. interpunctella that
   affects the response of male C. cautella to the pheromone or confusion
   caused by an increase in the amount of pheromone present. This reduced
   response of C. cautella must be considered when using pheromone-baited
   traps to estimate population levels when both species are present.}},

Abstract = {{Collections of chironomid pupal exuviae from the Oxford Canal were taken
   monthly from May to October 1991 at stations above and below the sewage
   effluent discharge at Kidlington, near Oxford.
   The chironomid exuvial assemblages showed clear changes reflecting the
   effects of the sewage, notably in the increased dominance of
   Parachironomus arcuatus and Chironomus riparius and other
   pollution-tolerant species downstream from the effluent inflow. A return
   to the pattern of taxa seen in the upstream stations was noted below the
   next canal lock, 2.8 km downstream from the effluent discharge.
   Environmental quality indices, calculated according to the Chironomid
   Pupal Exuvial Technique, also reflected the effects of the sewage
   inflow.
   The results show that chironomid populations, as sampled by collecting
   pupal exuviae, are potentially valuable for monitoring organic pollution
   in canals.}},

Abstract = {{One-year-old rope-grown blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) were held in
   experimental lantern nets and cross-transplanted between two sea lochs
   (Lochs Etive and Leven) on the west coast of Scotland. Growth and
   mortality were monitored from May 1991 to May 1992, as well as shell
   morphology in native and transplanted mussels. There were highly
   significant differences (P less than or equal to 0.001) in growth rates
   between lochs; both native and transplanted mussels performed better in
   all shell and tissue growth-parameters in Loch Etive than in Loch Leven.
   Stock also had a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) influence on
   shell length and live weight, but its contribution to total variance was
   considerable only in the latter case. Wet and ash-free dry meat weights
   were governed mainly by site and to some extent by site x stock
   interaction. Mortality rates were quite low (6 to 7\% yr(-1)) and did
   not show any significant variation either between sites or stocks. There
   were significant morphological differences (ratios of shell length,
   height and width) between the Loch Etive and Loch Leven populations (P
   less than or equal to 0.001) which persisted for one year after
   transfer. Stock appeared to be the main factor affecting shell
   morphology, as opposed to site. Linear regressions of shell height and
   width on length were significantly different between the native stocks,
   but became indistinguishable from those of the recipient populations one
   year after reciprocal transfer. This did not, however, conceal the
   effect of stock origin on dimensional ratios. It is concluded that site
   differences related to environmental factors, notably chlorophyll a
   levels and currents, and also possible stress caused by high levels of
   Zn and Cu, are major determinants of growth, which are of main interest
   to aquaculture, while morphological differences most probably result
   from genotypic variation.}},

Abstract = {{The usefulness of bottom-mounted, upward-looking sonars for long-term
   quantitative zooplankton monitoring was demonstrated utilizing a 49 d
   record of acoustic volume backscattering strengths collected by a 150
   kHz RDI Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler in LaHave Basin off Nova
   Scotia, Canada. Variations in the character and intensity of 2 distinct
   acoustic scattering horizons distinguished by differing diurnal
   migration patterns were noted. One horizon confined to the top 50 m and
   only present during the early parts of the recording was tentatively
   ascribed to juvenile fish. Another strongly migrating horizon identified
   with the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica was studied in detail. M.
   norvegica in daytime were broadly distributed at about 150 m depth. At
   night they were uniformly distributed in the upper 50 m. A 30 \%
   decrease in nighttime integrated backscattering levels was consistent
   with euphausiid accumulation in the acoustically unobservable
   near-surface region. Average target strengths declined
   less-than-or-equal-to 1 dB during active vertical migration. This
   observation, interpreted by acoustic scattering theory, constrained
   average euphausiid inclinations to little more than 30-degrees during
   upward swimming. Column integrated population densities were roughly 290
   m-2. Use of an inclined beam sonar geometry should result in
   backscattering levels less sensitive to organism orientation than use of
   a conventional vertically oriented sonar beam.}},

Abstract = {{Barnacle settlement was monitored at 5 sites separated by 50 to 250 m at
   Dike Rock, La Jolla, California, USA. Chthamalus spp. and Pollicipes
   polymerus settlement were spatially correlated at those sites. Within
   sites, settlement of the 2 species were correlated These results support
   the hypothesis of common onshore larval transport events for all sites
   and both species. Other spatiotemporal patterns were contrasting: 1 peak
   accounted for most of R polymerus settlement, while there were 5 peaks
   of similar magnitude for Chthamalus spp. At 2 sites, settlement plates
   were installed at 2 heights in the intertidal; Chthamalus spp.
   settlement was similar at the 2 heights, while P. polymerus settlement
   was relatively different at the sites, Such spatial patterns may have
   resulted from a stronger behavioral component affecting settlement in P.
   polymerus. These results suggest that, at scales of 100 m, temporal
   variability in settlement rate may be related to larval pool and
   physical transport processes, while spatial variability may be
   associated with behavioral response and substrate availability.
   Chthamalus spp. settlement was higher at sites where rocks were
   surrounded by unsuitable sandy substrate, possibly because settlement on
   available substrate is intensified where total suitable settlement area
   is relatively scarce. To test this, plates were installed at another
   site where suitable substrate was also scarce; as predicted, settlement
   was higher at both sites. At another study site in Medio Camino, Mexico,
   settlement became more predictable among sites along the rocky shore
   after the shoreline had been partially inundated by sand, further
   supporting this hypothesis. The proportion of unmetamorphosed settlers
   of Chthamalus spp., relative to total settlement, appeared to peak on
   particular days of the lunar cycle and was spatially correlated at the 5
   sites. The periodicity of the peaks was close to the 14.75 d
   spring-to-neap cycle, suggesting that these peaks may be related to
   periodic short-immersion times that did not allow the attached cyprids
   to metamorphose. Mortality of recently metamorphosed
   (less-than-or-equal-to 1 d) Chthamalus spp. spat by physical damage was
   spatially variable.}},

Abstract = {{The size-class structure of the only known population of the extremely
   rare (<100 individuals) Hawaiian shrub Tetramolopium arenarium was
   monitored semi-annually for two years. Mortality exceeded recruitment
   over the observation period, and the absence of seedlings suggests a
   population headed for extinction. Survival of this species likely will
   depend on artificial population augmentation with propagated seedlings.
   Three risk scenarios were evaluated with the use of stage-based
   transition matrix models, and results indicate that recovery of T.
   arenarium will require a massive program of artificial propagation and
   outplanting. Transition matrix models are shown to be potentially
   valuable to managers designing augmentation programs for other species.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of 24 house fly (Musca domestica L.) populations were collected
   from animal farms in Hungary in 1990 and kept in the laboratory to
   determine their susceptibility to different types of insecticide:
   organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, macrocyclic
   lactone and insect growth regulators.
   The adulticides were tested with topical bioassay in all 24 populations,
   the larvicides were studied with treated larval medium in 16
   populations. The data were expressed as LD50 and LC50 values (ng fly-1
   and mg kg-1 larval medium respectively).
   The percentages of populations which had resistance ratios > 10 at LD50
   or LC50 were: 63 \% to DDT, 50 \% to methoxychlor, 13 \% to lindane, 83
   \% to malathion, 63 \% to trichlorfon, 4 \% to propetamphos, 96 \% to
   dioxacarb, 46 \% to propoxur, 4 \% to methomyl, 13 \% to pyrethrum, 96
   \% to bioresmethrin, 63 \% to permethrin, 58 \% to cypermethrin, 79 \%
   to SK-80, 79 \% to deltamethrin, 38 \% to invermectin, 0 \% to
   diflubenzuron, 0 \% to cyromazine.
   Correlation analysis showed a high degree of positive correlation among
   the adulticides except for ivermectin, bioresmethrin and SK-80. No
   cross-resistance was found between the larvicides and the conventional
   adulticides.
   Differences of insecticide resistance levels among the populations
   surveyed were studied by principal component and factor analysis. A
   fairly good relationship between resistance status and control practices
   used on farms was revealed. The populations originating from those farms
   where the application of adulticides had been frequent or regular and
   where high resistance was shown to most chemicals could be separated
   from the others.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed knowledge of the distribution of roots in the soil is important
   in understanding the extraction of water and nutrients from soil.
   Various techniques have been developed to monitor root-length density
   under field conditions. Excavation techniques, including soil cores,
   have long been considered to give reliable estimates of root-length
   density, but these techniques are laborious in sample collection and
   tedious in determination of root lengths. An attractive alternative for
   monitoring root-length density has been the minirhizotron whereby a
   periscope is inserted into a clear tube permanently installed in the
   soil for repeated and rapid measures of root development. The objective
   of this study was to compare the ability of the minirhizotron technique
   to measure root-length density as compared to the root-core technique.
   As in previous studies, substantial disagreement existed between the two
   techniques in the top 30-cm of the soil, The results from the
   minirhizotron consistently indicated a much lower root population than
   the root-core technique in the surface layer of soil. This is especially
   worrisome because more than 45\% of the root-length density was found in
   this layer with the root-core technique. At deeper soil layers, the
   minirhizotron data pro;ed to be no less variable than the rest-core
   technique making the determination of statistically significant results
   difficult. Finally, the relationship between the minirhizotron and
   soil-core results varied with time even when the observations from the
   soil surface layer were ignored. Attempts to directly translate
   minirhizotron observations into a root-length density using a
   correlation approach would be suspect based on the results of this
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of soil moisture, temperature, crop plant, flooding, and
   addition of plant residues and CaCO3 on survival of phialospores of
   Chalara elegans in organic soil was studied.  The extent of survival of
   phialospores (number of propagules recovered from artificially infested
   soil) was monitored over a 19-wk duration using a semiselective medium
   (TB-2RBA).  Survival was significantly greater (P less-than-or-equal-to
   0.01) in soil maintained at a constant soil moisture level (matric
   potential of about -50 J/kg) than when moisture level gradually declined
   to about -900 J/kg; propagules could be recovered from both soil
   moisture treatments for up to 19 wk.  The presence of carrot plants did
   not significantly influence propagule survival when compared with fallow
   soil, and propagules of C. elegans could be detected after 19 wk of soil
   incubation at 20 C.  The presence of onion seedlings, however, decreased
   recovery of the pathogen to an undetectable level after 15 wk.  When
   soil was flooded and maintained at 4 C, survival was comparable to that
   in nonflooded, fallow soil.  However, with increasing temperature (15,
   20, or 25 C), recovery of phialospores from flooded soil was
   significantly reduced (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.01) and no propagules
   were detected after 12 wk.  In nonflooded soil at constant soil matric
   potential of about -50 J/kg, survival was reduced significantly only at
   30 C and not at any of the lower temperatures tested.  Addition of plant
   tissues of alfalfa, carrot, rye, and onion all significantly reduced the
   extent of survival of phialospores compared with the fallow control,
   with onion tissues having the most pronounced effect.  The addition of
   CaCO3 had no effect.  The results from this study indicate that
   phialospores of C. elegans can survive in organic soil for periods
   greater than 19 wk, especially under moist and cool conditions. 
   Survival of phialospores was reduced significantly by the presence of
   onion seedlings, flooding the soil at 25 C, and addition of plant
   residues.  These findings could have application for reducing inoculum
   of C. elegans under field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Current United Kingdom (UK) government policy on pesticides is aimed at
   minimizing rather than arbitrarily reducing usage. It is to be achieved
   through a rigorous Approvals process, the setting of statutory maximum
   residue limits, regular monitoring, legislation on the safe use of
   pesticides on farms, and a core-funded research program on topics such
   as improved forecasting of pest infestations, more effective application
   techniques, alternative control strategies, integrated pest management
   and sustainable farming systems. Over the longer term these measures are
   expected to bring about substantial real decreases in pesticide usage,
   without the need to impose arbitrary reduction targets, such as have
   been implemented by several other European countries. Reductions in the
   usage of particular chemicals will also occur as a result of the
   implementation of European Community (EC) environmental legislation on
   pesticide levels in ground and drinking water and pesticide discharges
   into the North Sea. With herbicides, the tonnage of active ingredient
   applied in the UK declined substantially during the 1980s, due mainly to
   the increased use of products which were more biologically active at
   lower dosage rates than those they replaced. The actual percentage of
   crops sprayed remained at 95 to 100. Further reductions are likely in
   the 1990s, enhanced by factors such as dose-cutting by farmers in
   response to economic rather than environmental pressures and an increase
   in set-aside. Weed scientists are currently studying the long-term
   effects on weed population dynamics of reduced herbicide inputs in
   cereals, set-aside management, and more environmentally friendly, lower
   input rotations, as part of a wider program of research designed to
   provide government with scientifically based information upon which to
   decide future policies.}},

Abstract = {{Oligochaete communities were monitored under semi-natural conditions in
   experimental ditch mesocosms. Twelve ditches were used in a
   Before-Control-After-Impact (BACI) experiment to study the effect of the
   insecticide chlorpyrifos. Another eight ditches were used in a
   randomized experiment to study the effect of eutrophication. Oligochaete
   communities were sampled by deploying trays of substratum for
   colonization over a 20-week period. The experiments were analyzed by
   multivariate analysis using redundancy analysis and Monte Carlo
   permutation to assess statistical significance. These novel methods have
   the advantage over classical multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
   of being distribution-free and of having no restrictive upper limit on
   the number of species that can be analyzed simultaneously. In the
   BACI-experiment no significant effect of chlorpyrifos on oligochaete
   communities was detected. Eutrophication effects were observed at the
   higher eutrophication levels in clay ditches. Oligochaete abundances
   decreased in those ditches. Considerable variation was attributed to
   stochastic factors given that the ditches were in an early developmental
   stage when the experiments were initiated.
   Large-scale experiments such as the ones that we describe require time
   to develop and stabilize before parameters of community structure like
   population abundance, can be employed to detect changes associated with
   water quality manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{Description of patterns of zooplankton abundance in reservoirs has
   usually taken one of two approaches: (1) determining the relative
   importance of spatial and temporal components of heterogeneity, or (2)
   relating spatial variation along a reservoir's long-axis to the effects
   of inflows from major tributaries. This study brings together these two
   approaches to better understand zooplankton heterogeneity in reservoirs.
   Spatial and temporal patterns of zooplankton abundance were monitored
   during the spring of three consecutive years in a large, southeastern
   United States reservoir. The amount of spatial variation in zooplankton
   abundance exceeded temporal variation for most taxa. The differences
   among sites were not fixed - but rather ephemeral, in that they changed
   over the course of each season. Significant spatial variation was
   detected on most sample dates for rotifers and crustacean zooplankton.
   The greatest variation was along the long-axis of the reservoir (uplake
   vs. downlake), and differences between main-stream and embayment sites
   were usually secondary contributors to heterogeneity. Spring peaks in
   zooplankton abundance occurred later at the upstream sites than at

   differential rates of warming in the two regions or by temporal

   was the basis of heterogeneity in this reservoir and the determinant of
   the ephemeral nature of spatial variation observed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Hylastes angustatus (Herbst) is a bark beetle that is an important
   though sporadic pest of commercially grown Pinus species in South
   Africa. It usually develops in pine logs that have been felled or
   otherwise damaged. The adult beetles are attracted to these logs by
   volatile chemicals produced by the damaged tissues. Host location and
   aggregation behaviour of H. angustatus were investigated in the
   laboratory using multiple-choice trials. The beetle prefers P. elliottii
   to P. patula, roots to stems, high to low beetle densities and bark
   treated with ethanol and/or low concentrations (1 \%) of monoterpenes.
   Hylastes angustatus appears to prefer hosts or parts of the plant with
   higher nutrient and moisture contents. Ethanol and low concentrations of
   monoterpenes are potentially useful attractants for monitoring H.
   angustatus populations in the field. The standard practice of replanting
   Pinus lots immediately after felling is not recommended.}},

   the environmental monitoring programme of the La Grande hydroelectric

   meadows over a period of several years. Here we present their main
   features as observed at three permanent sampling stations. Subtidal
   meadows are all found between depths of 0.5 and 4.0 m (mean low water
   level (MLWL)) on fine sand and silty clay sediments. Leaf biomass varies
   between 30 and 675 g dry weight (DW) m-2, and shoot densities from 50 to
   1500 m-2. Reproductive shoots average 5\% of the population, but can in
   some places reach 20\%. Results indicate large variations, both in
   density and biomass, with depth, season and from year to year. Natural
   variability in climatic conditions appears to be responsible for these
   variations. In James Bay, the eelgrass beds do not support a high
   diversity of associated fauna.}},

Abstract = {{A preliminary investigation was carried out in a hospital in the city of
   Lucknow, India, to provide information on the possible range of lead
   (Pb) exposure in pregnant women and fetuses, to correlate high Pb levels
   with various socioenvironmental factors, and to examine any possible
   association between reproductive outcome and Pb levels in this
   population. The results indicate that maternal blood lead levels were
   higher in those who experienced abnormal deliveries and in those who ate
   nonvegetarian diets or drank groundwater compared with the respective
   control groups. Placenta, cord blood, and fetal membranes from both
   normal and abnormal delivery cases showed no significant differences in
   their Pb content. Other socioenvironmental factors did not influence
   these Pb levels. However, incidence of higher Pb levels in maternal
   blood (17\% and 38\% with Pb > 25 mu g/dl in normal and abnormal
   deliveries, respectively) and cord blood (> 10 mu g/dl) reflect a need
   for regular monitoring and lowering of environmental Pb exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The indigenous arid zone shrub Acacia victoriae grows rapidly and is
   relatively shortlived. The relationship between population structure,
   growth and mortality was examined by annual monitoring of over 1200
   plants at twenty sites from 1978 to 1981. Sites were reassessed in 1992.
   Plants of similar size varied greatly in growth rate. Annual mortality
   ranged up to 16\%. Of 752 plants alive in 1981, 206 (27\%) survived
   until 1992. A transition matrix model, based on growth and mortality
   over the 3 year period, predicted a size-class frequency distribution
   after 12 years that was significantly different from the one observed in
   1992. The proportion of large plants present in 1992 was higher than
   predicted. The model's prediction that a large proportion of plants
   would remain in the lower size-classes was reliable. We concluded that
   size is not a good indicator of age and that it is unreliable to
   identify cohorts of this species by examining size-class frequency
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Theories of parental investment and parent-offspring conflict assume
   that investment involves a cost to the parent and a benefit to the
   offspring, but for herbivorous mammals, behavioral and nutritional
   weaning are gradual processes that are difficult to define, and little
   is known about the consequences of individual variation during weaning.
   To study the effects of late maternal care on offspring fitness, we
   removed female bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) from a marked population
   in Alberta, Canada, and monitored the survival, growth, and reproductive
   success of orphan and nonorphan lambs. Mothers were removed when lambs
   were 3.5-4.0 months, about 2-4 weeks before the suspected time of
   nutritional weaning. Female orphans and nonorphans had the same weight
   as yearlings, the same probability of producing their first lamb at 2
   years of age, the same lifetime reproductive success (lambs produced or
   lambs that survived to early autumn), and the same longevity. Male
   orphans from most cohorts were smaller as yearlings compared to
   nonorphans from the same cohort. They were unable to compensate for this
   early weight difference in later life: at 4 years, orphan males had
   smaller horns and were lighter than nonorphans. Small horn and body size
   likely lowered the reproductive success of orphaned males compared to
   nonorphans from the same cohort. We suggest that in this sexually
   dimorphic species late maternal care is more important for males than
   for females. Because late maternal care had no measurable benefit for
   daughters, we suggest that parent-offspring conflict over the duration
   of maternal care may not exist for mother-daughter pairs. For mother-son
   pairs it remains to be shown whether late maternal care involves a cost
   to the mother, but the assumption of a benefit to the son was met.}},

Abstract = {{Some fem species form spore banks - reservoirs in the soil of viable
   spores which remain dormant while buried but germinate in light if
   brought to the surface. The recently discovered characteristics of these
   spore banks are described. Enough is now known to suggest that they
   might have a role in the conservation of endangered fem species as
   alternatives to ex situ collections of sporophytes, gametophytes and
   spores, the relative merits of which are also considered. Mature
   sporophytes of several British species have now been raised from natural
   spore banks in soil samples; if this proves to be possible also for
   endangered species, some interesting options become available. The
   possibilities are discussed of augmenting surviving populations and
   increasing their genetic diversity, even perhaps of retrieving lost
   populations, by reintroduction of spore bank-derived plants or by
   stimulating regeneration from spore banks in situ. Botanic gardens are
   well placed to provide the further research, the regular monitoring of
   endangered populations, and the taxonomic and horticultural support
   required to realise these possibilities.}},

Abstract = {{When a nectar reward is relatively low in quality and quantity, is it an
   effective pollinator attractant? In Puerto Rico, Comparettia falcata, a
   hummingbird-pollinated epiphytic orchid, produces an average one-time
   secretion of 3.3-4.0 mul of nectar (composed of 12.9-15.1\% sugar) per
   flower. In contrast, nectar sugar concentrations of other hummingbird
   flowers on Caribbean islands are 17-37 percent, and those of Puerto Rico
   visited by the C. falcata pollinator have standing crops averaging
   2.0-6.2 mul and daily secretion rates of 3.1-10.6 mul. In 1989 and 1990,
   we monitored pollinator abundance, effective flower visitation,
   pollinarium removals (male success), pollinations, and fruit production
   (female success) at two sites in the Toro Negro Forest Reserve.
   Reproductive success at the two sites did not differ in either year when
   adjusted for differences in pollinator activity. In 1991, we clipped the
   spur tips of all flowers at one site rendering them nectarless.
   Visitation frequencies and measures of male and female fitness were
   adjusted for site differences in pollinator activity, and all were
   significantly lower at the site where flowers were nectarless. In 1992,
   we abandoned one site and manipulated the other by clipping the floral
   spurs of a randomly chosen subset of plants so that 25 percent of the
   flowers in the population were nectarless. Pollinarium removals from
   intact flowers were significantly different from those with cut spurs
   and total visits were nearly significant as well. However, the
   difference in female success was clearly not significant between the two
   treatments. The number of visits per flower dropped dramatically from
   previous years despite the highest level of bird activity yet censused.
   The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the pollinator,
   Chlorostilbon maugaeus, perceives the nectar reward despite its small
   quantity and low sugar content, this to the advantage of Comparettia
   flacata.}},

Abstract = {{Annual surveys of breeding Merlins were carried out between 1970 and
   1991 with more systematic effort from 1982 onwards. Mean annual
   occupancy rates did not differ significantly between heather, moorland
   tree and conifer plantation nest areas. Mean occupancy rates declined
   significantly in heather and moorland tree nest areas between 1970 and
   1991. These declines are probably associated with a progressive switch
   to conifer plantation nest areas that have ultimately affected over 50\%
   of breeding pairs. The Welsh population has probably remained relatively
   stable throughout the study period at approximately 60-70 pairs. The
   switch to conifer plantations is related to habitat; the switch was most
   pronounced on the grass moors of central and south Wales and probably
   occurred between 1975 and 1985, whereas on the heather moors of north
   Wales only a small number of ground-nesting sites have been vacated
   since 1985. This was partly due to the lack of afforestation on most of
   the Berwyn Mountains.
   The population changes in Wales are compared with those in other regions
   of Britain. It is suggested that, with the exception of the Northern
   Isles, the British breeding Merlin population no longer merits special
   conservation concern and should be removed from the `Red Data' list of
   British birds. However, its sensitivity to toxic contamination makes it
   a most useful environmental indicator species and future monitoring of
   populations is highly desirable.}},

Abstract = {{The coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari) has recently
   evolved high levels of resistance to endosulfan and other
   cyclodiene-type insecticides in New Caledonia. During population
   outbreaks this has contributed to levels of infestation of coffee
   berries reaching up to 90\%. Using degenerate primers in the polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) we have amplified a section of the cyclodiene
   resistance gene Rdl from H. hampei. This gene codes for a
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) gated chloride ion channel. Here we
   report that resistant strains of H. hampei carry exactly the same single
   amino acid replacement (alanine to serine) as that found in resistant
   Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) (Diptera: Drosophilidae). A molecular
   diagnostic based upon PCR-mediated amplification of specific alleles
   (PASA) is described. This technique is capable of detecting resistance
   or susceptibility in adults, larvae or eggs but not in susceptible
   females carrying resistant sperm. Its potential use in field monitoring
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Although Culiseta morsitans (Theobald) is a common Holarctic mosquito
   very little is known about its biology so many aspects of its
   life-history were studied, mainly in southern England, from 1964-1987.
   More limited observations were made in the south on the coastal Culiseta
   litorea (Shute). Both species laid an average of 109 eggs as an egg raft
   deposited on wet mud and leaf litter. At high humidities C. morsitans
   eggs can remain unhatched and viable for many months. Populations of
   both species overwinter as fourth instar larvae, pupation occurs in
   April and adults start emerging in early May. The adult season lasts
   until September or October. Both species feed principally on birds.
   Serological tests, however, on blood-engorged females show that a few
   feed on humans, although none has been caught in human bait collections.
   Light-traps are not very effective in sampling adults, although a few
   were caught in them, as they were in non-attractant suction traps. The
   relative sizes of adult populations of both species were monitored in
   most years from 1964-1980 on Brownsea Island, Poole Harbour, England,
   and showed a marked decline in the proportions of C. litorea, but there
   was a resurgence of this species after eight years, when the population
   again crashed.}},

   Most mosquitoes eclosed in a unimodal pulse during June although peak
   eclosion periods varied among years and sites. It required 26.6 +/- 1.5
   days for 90\% of individual populations to eclose. Temporal abundances
   of host-seeking females also suggested unimodal eclosion with peaks
   typically occurring in June and July. Most larvae overwintered in the
   fourth instar and pupated in early summer, as expected from adult data.
   However, many larvae overwintered in die third instar and did not molt
   into the fourth until July, which was after most eclosion was completed.
   These individuals may eclose in autumn or may spend a second winter as
   larvae.}},

Abstract = {{The role of advection of freshwater input in zooplankton distribution
   was evaluated from 16 surveys carried out in the southern Gulf of St.
   Lawrence during 1967-71. Biomass was structured according to two main
   patterns: large-scale gradients (>150 km) over the entire area and
   mesoscale (almost-equal-to 25 km) patches. Patterns exhibited seasonal
   and interannual variability without any sign of recurrence through time,
   unlike the spatial structure of surface water temperature and salinity
   which was typical of large-scale dispersion gradients resulting from the
   seasonal input of freshwater into the area. In most cases, overall
   distribution patterns of biomass and hydrographic variables were not
   significantly correlated, indicating that biomass patterns in the
   southern Gulf were not related to water mass characteristics and
   advection of freshwater runoff over the entire area. Although mesoscale
   patchiness was unrelated to hydrographic processes, patch size
   (almost-equal-to 25km) was similar to estimates obtained for the
   northern Gulf and for other coastal shelf areas. Large-scale gradients
   in biomass may correspond to species changes in relation to the salinity
   gradient and/or topography and bathymetric features. I conclude that
   biomass alone is not an adequate predictor for monitoring changes and
   variability of zooplankton in response to runoff variability.}},

Abstract = {{Progeny from 26 live oak (Quercus virginiana Mill. and Quercus
   fusiformis Small) were inoculated with conidia of Ceratocystis
   fagacearum (T.W. Bretz) J. Hunt. in two trials. The oaks were either
   superior selections, slow-growing selections rejected from a tree
   improvement program, postepidemic survivors in an oak wilt center, or
   preepidemic trees outside the oak wilt center. Symptom development was
   monitored for 244 and 99 days in the two trials. Seedlings from the
   postepidemic population survived significantly better than those from
   the preepidemic trees. Considerable diversity existed among the
   responses of the superior selections tested. In general, seedlings from
   the pre- and post-epidemic populations developed symptoms faster than
   seedlings from the tree improvement program; however, rapidity of
   symptom development was not a good predictor of final survival.
   Postepidemic seedlings survived as well as selections in one trial and
   better than most selections in the other trial.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of nonanadromous forms of salmonids has been linked to
   adaptive similarities between migration to the sea and migration to
   lakes, and to inhibition of smoltification by rapid development rates
   and early maturation. We examined the seasonal cycle of seawater
   adaptability in a landlocked (10 000 years) population of kokanee,
   Oncorhynchus nerka, to determine if the typical anadromous cycle
   persists in the absence of recent gene flow from sockeye salmon, as
   would be expected if components of smoltification are beneficial to a
   lacustrine existence. We also monitored the effects of maturation on
   seawater adaptability, to determine if they had an inhibitory effect on
   smoltification, as would be expected if a developmental conflict was
   responsible for the evolution of nonanadromous forms. Maturation was
   measured through the growth of gonadal tissue and the increase in
   circulating testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone. Landlocked kokanee
   showed the seawater adaptability cycle typical of sockeye salmon, and
   maturation had no inhibitory effect on seawater adaptability until near,
   or at, full maturity. We conclude that at least some components of
   smoltification must be beneficial to a life in lakes to account for the
   continued maintenance of the cycle. Further, rapid development and
   maturation on their own do not appear to account for the evolution of
   nonanadromous populations of O. nerka.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to find a suitable wild-rodent to be
   used as terrestrial bioindicator. The wild mice were trapped at three
   sites around Vienna and at a fourth location in the countryside.
   Apodemus flavicollis, the yellow-necked mouse, was the most frequently
   captured mouse at all four sites. For each sample hepatic microsomal
   protein content, cytochromes b5 and P450, and enzyme catalytic
   activities-ECOD, EROD, BROD and PROD were measured. Except for one male
   urban group no significant differences between rural and urban groups in
   ECOD activity were observed. Increased cytochrome b5 and P450 contents
   per mg of microsomal protein were found m one of the male and all the
   three female urban groups. However the alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase
   activities were significantly increased in both sexes of the three city
   groups. These results suggest that induction of cytochrome P450IA and
   P450IIB families has occurred in urban populations, indicating a
   possible pollution with halogenated dioxins and furans, PCBs, PAHs etc.
   The data show that induction of hepatic mixed function oxidase (HMFO)
   activity in the feral mouse Apodemus flavicollis can be successfully
   used as a terrestrial bioindicator for pollution monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Previous mark-recapture studies and population size estimates indicated
   that in the 1980s populations of the endangered Uncompahgre fritillary
   (Boloria acrocnema) declined-precipitously, apparently leading to
   extirpation at its type locality. This locality and a nearby second
   site, both high in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado,
   constitute the total known range of B. acrocnema. A survey of 20
   presumptive allozyme loci from one B. acrocnema population and seven
   populations of the closely related B. improba, sampled along the Rocky
   Mountain cordillera from the Yukon Territory, Canada, to the Wind River
   Range of Wyoming revealed that B. acrocnema populations are less
   variable genetically than are B. improba populations in the northern
   part of that species' North American range. Genetic variability was also
   assayed at 18 presumptive allozyme loci in populations of Boloria
   titania, which were sampled from five of the same locations for
   comparison with the B. improba-B. acrocnema clade. Low estimates of
   heterozygosity indicate that genetic and demographic factors preceded by
   historic human disturbance are causing the decline of B. acrocnema. In
   addition, persistent drought conditions in southwestern Colorado
   throughout the 1980s probably contributed to the population declines.
   Conservation recommendations include strict enforcement of the ban
   against collecting pursuant to the Endangered species Act, careful
   monitoring of known B. acrocnema sites, and possible translocations.
   Extreme measures beyond these will be costly and may be inappropriate
   for this relict species, which has an unknown capacity to persist in the
   face of local weather fluctuations and predicted regional warming
   trends,}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of effective population size is important in
   attempts to conserve small populations of animals or plants. We review
   the genetic and ecological methods that have been used to estimate
   effective population size in the past and suggest that, while genetic
   methods may often be appropriate for the estimation of N. and its
   monitoring ecological methods have the advantage of providing data that
   can help predict the effect of a changed environment on N(e). Estimation
   of N(e) is particularly complex in populations with overlapping
   generations, and we summarize previous empirical estimates of N(e) that
   used ecological methods in such populations. Since it is often difficult
   to assess what parameters and assumptions have been used in previous
   calculations, we suggest a method that provides a good estimate of N(e),
   makes clear what assumptions are involved, and yet requires a minimum of
   information. The method is used to analyze data from 14 studies. In 36\%
   (5) of these studies, our estimate is in excellent agreement with the
   original, and yet we use significantly less information; in 21\% (3) the
   original estimate is markedly lower, in 43\% (6) it is markedly higher.
   Reasons for the discrepancies are suggested. Two of the underestimates
   involve a failure in the original to account for a long maturation time,
   and four of the overestimates involve problems in the original with the
   correction for overlapping generations.}},

Abstract = {{A monitoring protocol that schedules future sample bouts based on the
   outcome of density classification and expected population growth has
   been developed and applied to monitoring European red mite (Panonychus
   ulmi Koch) through a growing season. The monitoring protocol is based on
   concatenating through time tripartite sequential classification sampling
   plans that use binomial counts in lieu of complete enumeration. Binomial
   counts are scored positive when the number of organisms (mites) on a
   sample unit (leaves) exceeds a tally number. At each sample occasion the
   monitoring procedure leads to one of three possible decisions; intervene
   when the density is high, sample at the next sample occasion (after one
   week) when the density is intermediate, and sample at the second next
   sample occasion (after two weeks) when the density is low. Evaluation of
   the monitoring protocol under field conditions showed that the protocol
   with constituent tally 0 binomial count sampling plans was quite
   successful in timing intervention at the moment when population
   densities were about to exceed an established threshold that dictated
   intervention. The performance of this monitoring protocol and another
   protocol in which constituent sampling plans used binomial counts with a
   tally number of 4 were compared using simulation. Sampling plans that
   used a tally number of 4 were more precise than plans that used a tally
   number of 0. However, the overall performance of die monitoring protocol
   based on tally 0 sampling plans did not greatly differ from the
   monitoring protocol based on tally 4 sampling plans. Simulated
   performance of the tally 0 protocol was corroborated by field
   evaluation. The monitoring protocol based on tripartite classification
   required 30 to 45 percent fewer sample bouts than a protocol based on
   conventional sequential classification at weekly intervals. The
   monitoring protocol based on tripartite classification was also better
   able to schedule intervention when needed compared to a protocol based
   on conventional classification at two week intervals. Using the tally 0
   protocol and current thresholds for P. ulmi, cumulative mite density was
   kept below 300 mite-days per leaf, which is well below levels regarded
   damaging. A tally 0 protocol with raised thresholds, developed on the
   basis of this finding, gave the best simulated performance of all
   protocols evaluated.}},

   infested monitoring site did not vary significantly with counts
   averaging from 46 to 118. Commercial bait stations containing a delayed
   action toxicant placed solely on the exterior walls of buildings, or
   outdoors, provided a 94\% reduction in Pharaoh ant numbers within 1 week
   in contrast to a 9\% reduction in untreated buildings. This was similar
   to the reductions from buildings treated with bait stations placed both
   indoors and outdoors. While a total of 3 ants were found indoors in
   treated apartments, indoor counts from untreated buildings also were
   low. Initial outdoor ant counts were 2 to 20 times higher than indoor

Abstract = {{Bottom sediments in surficial and short-core samples collected in
   different parts of highly polluted Mariut Lake, Nile Delta, EgyPt,
   record th, increased anthropogenic influence during the past century.
   The study is based on identification of lithofacies in shot-core
   sections integrated with petrographic analyses of grain size and
   composition of the sand-size fraction in both core and surficial
   samples. Most Mariut lacustrine subfacies that date back to the last
   century me similar to those in modern Nile Delta lagoons (Idku,
   Burullus, Manzala), and also to older lagoon deposits examined in
   Holocene core sections. During this century, the lake has become
   artificially separated into three distinct regions, each with different
   petrologic attributes. These differences are a function of both natural
   and man-influenced factors in the three settings: sabkha-desert
   conditions prevail in the topographically most isolated western sector
   southwest of Alexandria; totally enclosed artificial salt ponds in the
   central sector, south of Alexandria's industrial complex, into which
   waters are pumped from the sea; and much lower salinity sub-basins in
   ea.tern Mariut which receive large, amounts of fresh water, much of it
   polluted, through a series of canals, sewage outfalls and drains. With
   time, there have been lake-wide changes such as decreased proportions of
   benthic fauna, including molluscs.  Marked variations related to
   specific sub-basins include the formation of very dark, distinctly
   layered sediment subfacies in central Mariut, and deposits rich in
   bio-precipitate carbonate and plant debris in the eastern put of the
   lake. These latter water plant-related carbonate crusts are herein
   interpreted as indicators of increased pollution and eutrophication. The
   much increased domestic, industrial and agricultural wastes discharged
   into Mariut, particularly in eastern sub-basins, have serious potential
   consequences for the large, rapidly growing population of the Alexandria
   region. Closely integrated sedimentological and geochemical study of
   bottom sediments should be carried out to carefully monitor
   anthropogenic related changes.}},

Abstract = {{1. The complete demographies of 16 populations of Cirsium vulgare were
   followed in a replicated experiment. The experiment was a factorial
   combination of two intensities of sheep grazing in each of three seasons
   - winter (grazed or ungrazed), spring (grazed or ungrazed), and summer
   (light or heavy grazing) giving eight treatments in two blocks 2 For 6
   years from 1987 to 1992 the population sizes of C. vulgare were
   monitored in each of the 16 paddocks. After 1989 grazing in spring or
   winter or increased grazing in summer all increased population sizes.
   Population sizes fluctuated widely between years.
   3 The effects of the grazing treatments and plant sizes on the
   transitions between nine life-history stages were determined. There were
   no grazing effects on seed numbers per flowerhead, postdispersal seed
   survival or between year seed survival in the seed bank.
   4 More-intense summer or winter grazing increased seedling emergence by
   increasing the proportion of microsites with no canopy or with no
   litter. Emergence was found to respond positively to these factors.
   Seedling survival was increased by winter or spring grazing and winter
   grazing increased the year-to-year survival of small and medium-sized
   rosettes. These effects probably occurred through selective grazing
   decreasing competition from the dominant grasses. Larger rosettes had
   lower mortality rates which were unaffected by the grazing treatments.
   5 There was a minimum rosette size threshold for flowering above which
   flowering probability increased with size. Because winter grazing
   increased the survival of smaller rosettes it increased the proportion
   of smaller rosettes in the populations and thus decreased the proportion
   of rosettes flowering. By the same process winter grazing decreased the
   average size of flowering rosettes and, because smaller rosettes
   produced fewer flowerheads, this treatment decreased the flowerhead
   number of flowering rosettes.
   6 The lepidopteran seed predator Eucosma cana attacked a larger
   proportion of heads on plants with more flowerheads. By decreasing the
   average number of flowerheads per flowering plant winter grazing
   decreased the proportion of flowerheads on a plant attacked.
   7 Matrix analysis of life tables for each paddock showed that winter and
   spring grazing and increased summer grazing all significantly increased
   the population growth rate lambda. The population sizes of each paddock
   correlated significantly with the estimated lambda values.
   8 Elasticity analysis was performed on each matrix and elasticity values
   within each matrix were summed to give a value for fecundity (e(F)),
   Stasis (e(L)) and growth (e(G)). Triangular ordination of e(F), e(L) and
   e(G) showed that lambda became more sensitive to small changes in
   fecundity and less sensitive to small changes in stasis as grazing
   intensity increased.}},

Abstract = {{The autumn migration of 110 species or distinct races of birds was
   monitored from 1976 to 1986 by a standardized mist-netting program on
   the coast of central California. A peak in migration numbers occurred
   between mid-August and late October in a given year. Young birds were
   captured 9.1 times more frequently than adults. The number of birds
   banded annually in the autumn was not correlated with the number banded
   in the summer. There was no correlation between the number of young and
   adult birds banded in a given year. The 44 most common bird taxa had
   high annual variation in numbers and young:adult ratios, sometimes by a
   factor >10. The young:adult ratios were higher for species of woodland
   habitat, breeders along the coast and interior mountains of California,
   and much higher for neotropical migrants and permanent residents with a
   winter influx of individuals. Adults of species breeding in California
   mountains varied greatly in annual capture rates. The high annual
   variation emphazies that long-term studies are necessary to understand
   the importance of an area to individual or groups of species during
   migration periods. A higher diversity of species and greater number of
   individuals were captured during autumn than summer, and habitat along
   migratory routes may be as essential as breeding and wintering habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Insensitive acetylcholinesterase (Ace(R)) and five over-produced
   esterases (A1, A2 and B2, and A4 and B4) involved in detoxification are
   responsible for resistance to organophosphorous insecticides (OPs) in
   Culex pipiens L. from the Rhone-Alpes region, where C. pipiens control
   is mainly accomplished with the OPs temephos and chlorpyrifos using 0.15
   mg/liter doses. The strong linkage disequilibria observed between
   esterases Al and Est-2(0.64), esterases A4 and B4, and esterases A2 and
   B2 indicate that these genes were introduced in the Rhone-Alpes region.
   Ace(R) and esterase A1, which appeared in the south of France 3 yr
   before the start of mosquito control in Rhone-Alpes, had the highest
   frequencies. All resistant genotypes were shown to be killed by 0.15
   mg/liter temephos in natural breeding sites, but not by 0.15 mg/liter

Abstract = {{The ability of time-release formulations of larvicides and insect growth
   regulators (IGRs) to provide long-term control of Aedes albopictus was
   investigated in the field. Larvicides used in the study were Bactimos(R)
   pellets (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis, active ingredient) and
   Abate(R) pellets (temephos, active ingredient). The IGR Altosid(R)
   (methoprene, active ingredient) was used in pellet and sand
   formulations. Application rates were higher than label recommendations.
   In a preliminary test, clay flower bowls were treated with 2 g of
   material. Bactimos pellets failed to provide control after 60 days.
   Abate pellets and the Altosid formulations provided essentially 100\%
   control for 150 days. After 360 days in the field, the Abate pellets
   produced 100\% larval mortality, and significant levels of control were
   provided by the Altosid formulations and the Bactimos pellets. In a
   small-scale operational trial of this technique, 1 g of Altosid pellets
   was applied to every container that could be located in 2 urban
   residential neighborhoods in Lake Charles, LA. Aedes albopictus biting
   populations were monitored weekly in the treated areas and in an
   untreated control area. Biting population densities declined
   significantly in treated areas compared with the control area. Results
   suggested that long-term control of Ae. albopictus populations can be
   achieved economically with one application of Altosid pellets or Abate
   pellets in containers.}},

   habitats on Great Bahama Bank in the winter months (December-February)
   of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. A total of 10376 fishes were collected in
   1990-1991 from 58 taxa; in 1991-1992, 13 358 fishes were collected from
   56 taxa. Vertical distributions of 16 dominant taxa suggested that most
   settlement-stage fishes were concentrated in surface waters. Six taxa
   showed no year x depth interaction; of these, five were significantly
   more abundant in the surface nets. Eight of the ten taxa with
   significant year x depth interactions displayed a tendency to be more
   abundant in surface layers than in sub-surface collections during the
   first year, but were more evenly distributed across surface and
   sub-surface collections in the second year of sampling. Larval supply of
   six taxa showed significant coherency over spatial scales from 0.5 to
   1.5 km. Over scales up to 5 km, however, larval supply became largely
   decoupled at the daily level. Significant inter-annual variability in
   the vertical and horizontal distributions of settlement-stage fishes
   suggests that behavior may play a major role in determining larval
   supply in tropical shorefishes.}},

Abstract = {{Plankton nets were moored in tidal channels around Lee Stocking Island
   to monitor larval supply of fishes to nursery habitats that fringe Exuma
   Sound, Bahamas. Sampling was conducted continuously through two
   consecutive winters of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. Meteorological and
   hydrographic data were also recorded during these periods. Three of the
   six most abundant taxa (leptocephali, Bothidae and Ophidiidae) showed
   strong lunar associations, with periodicities between 28 and 30 d.
   Labrids were the only family to show evidence of any semi-lunar
   activity. The time series for the families Clupeidae and Tetraodontidae
   appeared to be stochastic. Cross-correlation analyses were used to
   examine coupling of larval replenishment and physical processes. Four of
   six taxa examined showed significant relationships between larval supply
   and onshore winds at short time lags during 1990-1991. In 1991-1992,
   however, taxa showed stronger associations with the northwest,
   long-shore wind component than with onshore winds. Coherency in larval
   supply among several taxa was remarkably strong. This implies either
   that the magnitude of spawning is linked among taxa, or that planktonic
   processes are affecting a number of taxa in very similar ways. The
   similarities in the magnitude of supply events among taxa found here may
   be related to complex interactions between larval behavior and the
   physical environment.}},

Abstract = {{The sexuality, reproductive mode, and timing of reproduction of
   Pocillopora verrucosa from the Republic of Maldives, Indian Ocean, were
   assessed using serial histological sections.  These showed that P.
   verrucosa is an annual simultaneous hermaphrodite, with gonads arranged
   in two opposing arcs of alternating testes and ovaries, six gonads in
   each arc.  No planulae were observed in any dissection or histological
   analysis carried out, therefore making brooding unlikely.  Broadcast
   spawning is inferred from the disappearance of mature gametes from
   samples collected between late March and April 1991.  Mean oocyte size
   at spawning was 53.5 mum and mean potential fecundity was approximately
   7300 oocytes cm-2 yr-1.  The reproductive pattern of P. verrucosa in the
   Maldives is compared to that of the same species in different locations,
   the short breeding season in March to April occurring earlier in the
   Maldives than in Red Sea populations.  The maximum mean oocyte diameter
   found in Maldivian specimens was much smaller than elsewhere.  The
   year-to-year variation in numbers of oocytes/polyp within single
   colonies, and the variation between colonies within the population was
   significant (p < 0.01).  Therefore, it is possible that fecundity is not
   a good variable to use when monitoring stress on coral reefs unless
   larger numbers of estimates can be routinely made.  Some colonies
   contained immature oocytes at spawning that were not released and
   continued to grow to approximately twice the size of the spawned oocytes
   that were presumed to be mature.  These unspawned oocytes were
   oosorbing, and were characterised by the presence of zooxanthellae and
   large numbers of vacuoles in their cytoplasm.  This gradual expansion
   and oosorption of unspawned oocytes has not been documented previously
   for corals.}},

   A low density population of hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus was
   artificially increased in numbers while simultaneously a high density
   population was reduced. Subsequent dispersal, mortality and natality
   were monitored in complete censuses of the total populations, and
   compared to a control population of transplanted hedgehogs at unchanged
   density. Predation on hedgehogs was principally by badgers Meles meles
   which forage for substantially similar foods to hedgehogs, and was
   significantly higher in the expanded population during the first 2 wk
   after transplant than in the control, which nevertheless suffered a high
   overall mortality. Dispersal of male hedgehogs in particular from the
   expanded population contributed to reducing the density close to its
   original level within 1 month of transplant, after which the population
   remained relatively stable for a further 2 months of monitoring.
   Surviving hedgehogs at this site maintained closer proximity to
   residential buildings. which were avoided by badgers, than those at the
   control site, rates of weight gain by males were also superior to those
   in the control population. The artificially reduced population in an
   urban area containing no badgers was partially replenished within 1
   month. through a decreased loss rate and an increased gain rate,
   initially of adults and later in the year of juveniles born after the
   transplant. The hedgehogs here showed seasonal variation in dispersion
   between fields, which were associated with the breeding cycle and the
   distribution of earthworm prey. Hedgehogs utilized mown grass fields in
   relation to the availability of earthworms Lumbricus spp., which was
   itself dependent on the age of fields. The study demonstrates that
   predation can influence the abundance of hedgehogs as well as their
   distribution in a heterogeneous environment. Residential and urban
   patches of land appear to represent a niche largely free from badger
   activity, where hedgehog populations maintain a high equilibrium density
   despite predation by domestic dogs which can contribute to a rapid
   population turn-over.}},

Abstract = {{A simple stochastic model for resource-limited populations is proposed
   and its properties examined by simulations. Features of the model are an
   explicit resource-limit. which cannot be exceeded, and a realised
   population growth-rate which is influenced by resource availability. In
   a range of simulations, the size and variability of resource levels and
   growth-rates were varied, but the pattern of variability of each
   parameter was kept the same. At most resource-levels and growth-rates
   considered, the model populations showed the general synchrony typical
   of many monitored butterfly populations and also showed strong synchrony
   between fluctuations in resource level and population size. As
   resource-levels and/or population growth-rates declined, both types of
   synchrony were eventually lost as the model populations became highly
   unstable and liable to extinction. Other properties of the model are
   discussed and contrasted with classical population models based on
   difference equations.}},

Abstract = {{A previous description of the lumbricid communities of the Test and
   Control sites of Project ELF is revised and updated, based on 5
   full-season years of sampling. These 5 years (1984 - 1988) encompass the
   pre-operational period of the U.S. Navy's ELF antenna in Michigan, and
   resulting data represent a partial foundation for future conclusions
   regarding potential effects of ELF electromagnetic fields. Of a total of
   eight species, seven are now known to be common to both sites, only A.
   longa remaining unique to the Test community. Annual fluctuations in
   species dominance, diversity and equitability are shown to be
   appreciable. Potential sources of error in the derivation of community
   indices, due either to sampling technique or to problems in immature
   identification, are listed. Variations in community structure due to the
   relative contribution of species with different life styles are
   discussed, using vertical distribution, habits and population structure
   as criteria. Year-to-year variations in these parameters are presented.
   Analysis of horizontal distribution of species is used as indicator of
   the homogeneity of each study site.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of monitoring for cyclodiene resistance in Drosophila
   populations via insecticide bioassay was compared directly with results
   from PCR-based genotyping of individual insects (PCR/REN). Insecticide
   bioassays were performed on several hundred insects collected from each
   of 10 sites and PCR/REN on only 100 insects per site. The mean
   resistance frequency estimate by bioassay (0.02) was twice as high as
   that observed by PCR/REN (0.01) and was associated with a greater
   variance. We were also able to document a high frequency of expected RS
   survivors in the bioassay that were later genotyped as susceptible (SS).
   If similar trends hold at higher frequencies of resistance, this could
   lead to serious overestimation of resistance frequencies. This study
   highlights two advantages of PCR/REN over insecticide bioassay (i).
   Estimations of resistance frequency via PCR/REN are more precise that
   those derived by bioassay, and (ii) resistance frequencies can be
   determined by PCR/REN with correspondingly smaller sample sizes. The
   implications of these results for resistance monitoring and for the
   persistence of resistance genes in untreated populations are discussed.

   immunological properties. The mutant strain was at least as virulent as
   the parental wild strain and was used as an epidemiological tool for the
   study of the population dynamics of X. albilineans. Populations of X.
   albilineans GPE 5SR and symptom expression of leaf scald were monitored
   in six sugarcane clones differing in resistance to the disease. The
   pathogen invaded leaves, stalks, and roots. The apex of the stalk
   including the apical meristem was invaded. Symptom expression and
   population size in leaves and shoot apices were correlated under field
   conditions. In contrast, the pathogen populations in the older portion
   of stalks increased initially after inoculation and then remained stable
   for both studied clones, whatever the progress of the disease. Sugarcane
   inoculated with X. albilineans and maintained under greenhouse
   conditions exhibited few or no symptoms but was colonized by the
   pathogen. Pathogen populations were highest in susceptible clones. Thus,
   high population densities of X. albilineans in sugarcane are necessary
   but not always associated with development of disease symptoms.
   Nevertheless, the correlation between colonization of plants and leaf
   scald resistance may be useful for screening sugarcane clones for
   resistance to the disease.}},

   increased 313\% in the mountains Df southern California, but they
   decreased 52\% in northern California, and 61\% in areas where timber
   was removed since 1986. Most of the areas preferred by resident mountain
   lions in 1986 were avoided in 1992 after they were clearcut. Whereas
   residents preferred unharvested and non-forest areas in 1992, track set
   densities of deer were the same with or without timber loss. Mountain
   lion track set density might have decreased due to degradation of
   habitat quality other than prey availability, or it might have decreased
   as part of a natural population cycle, which is common among species of
   Carnivora. When this decrease was added to the changes observed at three
   sites monitored since 1980, the pattern resembled nearly one complete
   cycle. Plans for management and research of mountain lions should
   include the effects of habitat loss and natural population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of agroecosystem diversification on the most abundant
   herbivore species of soybean (Glycine max Merrill) in Ohio were
   monitored during 1988, 1989 and 1990. Maize and soybean plots were
   arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates for
   a 3 X 2 factorial experiment. Factors were cropping systems (maize
   monoculture, soybean monoculture and strip intercropping of maize and
   soybean) and tillage systems (no-tillage and conventional tillage). The
   herbivore fauna of soybean was sampled by sweep net and suction net
   (D-Vac). Statistically significant results from at least 1 year
   indicated that no-tillage was favorable to Japanese beetle (Popillia
   japonica Newman), grape colaspis (Colaspis brunnea (F.)), tarnished
   plant bug (Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois)), homopterans
   (Cicadellidae and Cercopidae), grasshoppers (Melanoplus spp.) and slugs
   (Gastropoda). Potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae (Harris)), green
   cloverworm (Plathypena scabra (F.)), and striped flea beetles
   (Phyllotreta spp.) were more abundant in conventional tillage plots.
   Strip intercropping was favorable to green cloverworm, Japanese beetle,
   and grape colaspis, whereas the potato leafhopper were more abundant in
   monoculture plots. There was no evidence of reduced herbivory in
   diversified agroecosystems, as predicted by the resource concentration
   hypothesis.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Palmes diffusion tubes have been used to measure nitrogen dioxide
   concentrations at 363 urban sites throughout the United Kingdom during
   the Period of July-December 1991. Average concentrations over the period
   ranged from less than 10 ppb in northern Scotland to around 50 ppb at
   near-road sites in London. A total of 243 sites provided valid data for
   both this survey and an earlier, similar, study in 1986. On average,
   concentrations were about 34\% larger in 1991. Increases occurred
   throughout the country and were not confined to any particular area or
   region, although the percentage change tended to be larger in the north
   and west and where concentrations were small.
   The observed difference in concentrations was consistent with
   differences in meteorological conditions between the periods covered by
   the two surveys and the 38\% increase in emissions of NO(x) from motor
   vehicles over the period. However, there is no evidence from continuous
   monitoring between 1987 and 1991 of a marked trend in concentration at
   any one site.
   The shortening of the diffusion path in the diffusion tube due to wind
   effects has been demonstrated. This leads to a tendency for diffusion
   tubes to overread relative to chemiluminescent analysers. However, if
   the tubes are mounted in a sheltered location the overestimate is small.
   Since, in this survey, most of the samplers were mounted close to the
   sides of buildings, the data were not corrected, although the
   concentrations may be overestimates at some sites.
   In order to provide information on the spatial distribution of NO2 over
   the whole country, population density (related to vehicle density) was
   used along with the survey results together with additional data on
   rural concentrations, to map NO2 concentrations over Great Britain. This
   suggests that around one third of the population lives in regions where
   the mean concentration exceeds the European Community Directive Guide
   Value for median concentration. However this proportion would be reduced
   if the tendency for the tubes to overread and the fact that the mean
   value is generally larger than the median were taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored postbreeding movements of 34 Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)
   hens that nested in Suisun Marsh, California, in 1987 using radio
   telemetry. Hens began leaving Suisun Marsh in late May, and 50\% had
   departed by mid-June. We located 27 of 34 hens from late June through
   September during aerial searches; 25 hens had migrated north out of the
   study area, and two remained near the nesting area. We determined the
   molting areas of 20 hens: nine in Oregon and 11 in California. These
   molting areas were 12-536 km from nesting sites. Wetlands used by
   molting Mallards were dominated by bulrush (Scirpus spp.) and cattail
   (Typha spp.), were traditionally flooded during summer, and often
   associated with lakes or rivers. Molting areas of seven hens located at
   least once after leaving the study area were not determined, and seven
   other hens were never relocated indicating probable migration north of
   the search area. Two hens were recaptured in 1988 and radio-tracked to
   molting areas used the previous year, 121 and 484 km north of the
   breeding area. Mallards appear to exhibit site fidelity to molting
   areas. Migrating to an area with preferred molting habitat may enhance
   survival during the flightless period and early part of the hunting
   season.}},

Abstract = {{Racers (Coluber constrictor) were monitored with radiotelemetry in an
   old field/forest habitat surrounding a Carolina bay in South Carolina.
   Racers were active on approximately 70\% of days; inactive snakes
   usually were in ecdysis. Active racers were relocated on the ground
   surface (40\%), above ground in shrubs and trees (35\%), and underground
   (25\%). Habitats in which racers were relocated were thickets and
   grassland shrubs (50\%), woodland/forest (25\%), and grassland (25\%).
   Active snakes moved an average of 104 m/d within home ranges averaging
   12.2 ha estimated as minimum convex polygons. The home range of each
   snake included at least a portion of the bay and overlapped with home
   ranges of other snakes. In comparison with other studies of racers in
   which data were collected, analyzed, and presented in the same manner as
   in this study, home range size and daily movement of South Carolina
   racers were significantly greater. Possible explanations for the greater
   movement include trophic level differences and a proximate response to a
   local drought.}},

Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The power of any test of an environmental impact is simultaneously
   constrained by (1) the variability of the data, (2) the magnitude of the
   putative impact, and (3) the number of independent sampling events. In
   the context of the Before-After-Control-Impact design with Paired
   sampling (BACIP), the variability of interest is the temporal variation
   in the estimated differences in a parameter (e.g., population density)
   between two unperturbed sites. The challenges in designing a BACIP study
   are to choose appropriate parameters to measure and to determine the
   adequate number and timing of sampling events. Two types of studies that
   are commonly conducted can provide useful information in designing a
   BACIP study. These are (1) long-term studies that provide estimates of
   the natural temporal and spatial variability of environmental parameters
   and (2) spatial surveys around already-perturbed areas (''After-only''
   studies) that can suggest the magnitude of impacts.
   Here we use data from a long-term study and an After-only study to
   illustrate their potential contributions to the design of BACIP studies.
   The long-term study of parameters sampled at two undisturbed sites
   yielded estimates of natural temporal variability. Between site
   differences in chemical-physical parameters (e.g., elemental
   concentration) and in individual-based biological parameters (e.g., body
   size) were quite consistent through time, while differences in
   population-based parameters (e.g., density) were more variable. Serial
   correlation in the time series of differences was relatively small and
   did not appear to vary among the parameter groups. The After-only study
   yielded estimates of the magnitude of impacts through comparison of
   sites near and distant from a point-source discharge. The estimated
   magnitude of effects was greatest for population-based parameters and
   least for chemical-physical parameters, which tended to balance the
   statistical power associated with these two parameter groups.
   Individual-based parameters were intermediate in estimates of effect
   size. Thus, the ratio of effect size to variability was greatest for
   individual-based parameters and least for population and
   chemical-physical parameters.
   The results suggest that relatively few of the population and
   chemical-physical parameters could provide adequate power given the time
   constraints of most studies. This indicates that greater emphasis on
   individual-based parameters is needed in field assessments of
   environmental impacts. It will be critical to develop and test
   predictive models that link these impacts with effects on populations.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term studies provide useful insight into the functioning of
   populations and communities. Gaining a long-term perspective may be
   important in providing background information upon which BACI
   (Before-After-Control-Impact)-type impact studies can be designed or in
   identifying many types of impact, particularly those of a large-scale
   and diffuse nature. Although marine soft-bottom communities commonly
   exhibit patchy distributions, in many long-term studies few replicates,
   from each site, are collected on each occasion. To illustrate potential
   problems encountered when spatial variation confounds temporal patterns,
   we use data collected from a monitoring program of the intertidal
   sandflat communities of Manukau Harbour, New Zealand. Randomization
   techniques were used to generate possible temporal sequences, based on a
   sample size similar to that used in many long-term studies. In the
   generated sequences the timing and size of annual density changes were
   often different from the observed sequence, and indications of trends in
   density were often missed. In order to provide accurate descriptions of
   temporal variability in the soft-bottom communities of estuaries and
   coastal embayments, low bias and highly precise density estimates from
   each sampling occasion are required.}},

Abstract = {{In laboratory experiments, we tested the capability of larger age-0
   walleye pollock to consume smaller members of their cohort. In separate
   aquaria, 81 pairs of juveniles covering a wide range of size differences
   (total lengths differing by 12 to 61 mm) were held and monitored over a
   4 day period. Complete consumption, in which a smaller fish was
   swallowed whole by a larger fish, occurred 11\% of the time. In 36\% of
   the pairs, attacks by the larger fish resulted in mortality of the
   smaller fish. The mouth width:body depth ratio between the larger and
   smaller fish of a pair differed significantly depending on whether the
   smaller fish survived, was killed but not consumed, or was ingested
   whole by the larger fish. Cannibalistic individuals could consume fish
   close to the maximum size physically possible under gape limitation; at
   this size the length of the cannibal was approximately 1.7 times the
   length of the prey. Length-frequency distributions of age-0 pollock in
   field concentrations suggested that, at least in some geographical
   areas, potential cannibals and prey commonly co-occur. Unsuccessful
   predatory attacks by larger individuals may have additional detrimental
   effects on smaller pollock in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the Great Lakes International Surveillance Plan, 1978-83, egg
   contaminant levels and reproductive output were determined for Herring
   Gull colonies on Lake Superior in 1983. Since 1974, the Herring Gull has
   been widely used in the Great Lakes as a spatial and temporal monitor of
   organochlorine (OC) contaminant levels and associated biological
   effects. Most eggs contained a wide range of OCs, the main compounds
   being DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dieldrin, heptachlor
   epoxide, oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene and mirex. Levels of an
   additional ten OCs and five polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD)
   congeners were also determined for some sites. Overall, levels varied
   significantly among colonies, but there was no obvious relationship to
   spatial distribution of contaminants in sediments or fish species. OC
   levels in eggs had declined by up to 84\% since 1974. Eggshells were
   only 8\% thinner than before the introduction of DDT, and shell thinning
   was not a cause of breeding failure. Average reproductive output varied
   from 0.15 to 1.57 young per apparently occupied nest in 1983: at 56\% of
   colonies the value was below that thought necessary to maintain stable
   populations. The main causes of failure were egg disappearence and
   cannibalism of chicks. Despite this, the population appeared to have
   been increasing at about 4\% per annum. Reduced availability of forage
   fish during the early 1980s was the most likely reason for the poor
   reproductive output in 1983.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of mitochondrial and multilocus nuclear genotypic
   frequencies were monitored for 2 yr in experimental populations
   established with equal numbers of two poeciliid fishes (Gambusia affinis
   and Gambusia holbrooki) that hybridize naturally in the southeastern
   United States. In replicated `'small-pool'' populations (experiment I),
   1018 sampled individuals at six time periods revealed an initial hush of
   hybridization, followed by a rapid decline in frequencies of G. affinis
   nuclear and mitochondrial alleles over 64 wk. Decay of gametic and
   cytonuclear disequilibria differed from expectations under random mating
   as well as under a model of assortative mating involving empirically
   estimated mating propensities. In two replicate `'large-pond''
   populations (experiment II), 841 sampled individuals across four
   reproductive cohorts revealed lower initial frequencies off, hybrids
   than in experiment I, but again G. holbrooki alleles achieved high
   frequencies over four generations (72 wk). Thus, evolution within
   experimental Gambusia hybrid populations can be extremely rapid,
   resulting in consistent loss of G. affinis nuclear and cytoplasmic
   alleles. Concordance in results between experiments and across genetic
   markers suggests strong directional selection favoring G. holbrooki
   genotypes. Results are interpreted in light of previous reports of
   genotype-specific differences in life-history traits, reproductive
   ecology, patterns of recruitment, and size-specific mortality, and in
   the context of patterns of introgression previously studied indirectly
   from spatial observations on cytonuclear genotypes in natural Gambusia
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Consumption of seafood in the USA has increased over the last decade and
   this trend is expected to continue. The 1989 National Marine Fisheries
   Service consumption figure was 15.9 lb of edible meat per person per
   year. Total commercial landings were a record 8.5 X 10(9) lb in 1989,
   and imported edible products totaled 3.2 x 10(9) lb. The majority of the
   seafood supply in the USA was taken from wild populations. The
   aquaculture portion of this supply is also expected to increase. A
   substantial amount of seafood (600 X 10(6) lb of finfish and 300 x 10(6)
   lb of shellfish) is caught recreationally. About 70\% of commercially
   produced seafood in the USA is sold fresh or frozen. Canned seafood
   constitutes approximately 25\%, and smoked/cured products 5\%, of the
   seafood consumed. The USA exported 1.4 x 10(9) lb of edible domestic
   fishery products in 1989. Landings by the seafood industry are
   fragmented, diversified, seasonal, complex, and difficult to manage.
   Studies are needed to monitor changing consumption trends and patterns.
   The processing, distribution, and merchandising of finfish and shellfish
   will require more emphasis to reduce cross-contamination. Over 20\% of
   seafood consumed in the USA is derived from recreational or subsistence
   fishing. Attention should be given to: (1) aquaculture, to produce
   high-quality, consistently available species; (2) landing, handling,
   distribution, and preparation of recreationally caught fish, to ensure
   consumer safety; (3) educating the industry and the consumer about safe
   handling practices, to reduce potential food-handling problems; (4)
   advances in biotechnology to insure adequate supply of exhaustable
   fishery resources; (5) developing international agreements to harmonize
   regulations and insure equivalence between domestic and imported
   products.}},

Abstract = {{A greenhouse study was conducted to investigate the host-pest
   relationships of seven cultivars of strawberry, Fragaria spp., that
   differed in resistance to the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus
   urticae Koch. Plants were infested with a homogeneous density of females
   per unit of leaf area. Mite population development and plant damage were
   monitored on a weekly basis for 6 wk on initially infested and
   subsequently colonized leaves. Cultivars differed in their support of
   mite populations and in sensitivity to mite damage from the second to
   the fifth week of the experiment. `Floridabelle' showed antibiotic and
   antixenotic characteristics by supporting the lowest population density
   and showing lower damage values than other cultivars. `Totem'
   demonstrated high levels of tolerance by withstanding higher populations
   than other cultivars with damage comparable to that of resistant clones.
   `Canoga' and `Profumata di Tortona' showed hypersensitive responses to
   relatively low populations. `Rainier', which supported high populations
   and demonstrated high overall damage values, was susceptible. `Chandler'
   and `Selva' demonstrated resistance patterns which were intermediate.
   Resistance to the twospotted spider mite appears to be qualitative
   because it is conditioned by different mechanisms among cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1986 and 1991, we monitored the movements of > 60 radiocollared
   wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) in the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary,
   Northwest Territories, Canada, and adjacent areas. Based on
   minimum-convex polygons, animals of different sex and age classes had
   different sizes of home ranges. Median size of home ranges for
   young-of-the-year (712.2 km2),  immature males (706.0 kM2), and adult
   females (1,240.5 kM2),   inhabiting areas providing significantly less
   available forage, were similar, and significantly larger than the median
   size of home ranges of two classes of mature adult males (younger, 434.5
   km, and older, 170.1 kM2) and adult females inhabiting areas providing
   significantly more available forage (397.8 km2). This observation was
   consistent with the predictions of the food-exploitation hypothesis.
   Significant differences in size of home range between adult females
   inhabiting areas with greater forage availability, young-mature and
   old-mature adult males, and peripheral adult males (1,062.5 km2) were
   consistent with the predictions of the social-system hypothesis. Food
   and social class are important factors in determining size of home range

Abstract = {{Little is known about the impact of transgenic plant products on soil
   organisms. However, previous research with synthetic organics,
   allelochemicals, and extracellular enzymes can be used to guide future
   research in this area. Projects designed to quantify the impact of
   transgenic plants on soil organisms must clearly establish that the gene
   products are responsible for any observed changes. This can only be
   achieved by determining the fate of transgenic plant gene products
   during the period of the soil bioassay. The overall impact of transgenic
   plants will be dictated by not only the primary gene product, but
   secondary products resulting from abiotic and biotic soil reactions.
   Primary and secondary products may exhibit both acute and chronic
   impacts. Such impacts are best quantified using a soil microcosm in
   which fungal populations and micro- and mesofauna are monitored.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting of Great Basin Canada geese, Branta canadensis moffiti, on 20
   islands in the Hanford Reach of the mid-Columbia River has been surveyed
   since 1953. Nest counts declined from over 300 in 1958 to a low of 108
   in 1975. Since then, nest counts increased to a peak of 274 in 1989. The
   decline in 1960-1975 is attributed to the complete loss of Locke Island
   as a nesting habitat caused by persistent coyote, Canis latrans,
   predation. In the early years, Locke Island alone accounted for 30 to
   50\% of the nests in the Hanford Reach. The increase in nest counts
   after 1975 reflects increasing nest density on islands downriver from
   Locke Island. Downriver islands were historically relatively free from
   coyotes. In 1989 and 1990, 70\% of the nests were on five downriver
   islands near the city of Richland. The average annual nest count for
   1981-1990 was 215. Eighty percent of the nests were successfully
   hatched. The occurrence of unsuccessful nests was attributed to
   depredation 8.4\%, nest abandonment 7.7\%, flooding 2.6\%, and 0.5\% of
   the successful nests had infertile eggs. These observations document
   year-to-year changes in the island nesting population of Canada geese
   along the last remaining unimpounded section of the Columbia River in
   the United States. Population changes are related to the changing
   environment, including coyote predation, in eastern Washington. These
   studies demonstrate the value of long-term monitoring in assessing
   environmental change.}},

   FISH - THE IMPORTANCE OF SETTLEMENT VERSUS POSTSETTLEMENT LOSS}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand variability in recruitment to populations of
   benthic and demersal marine species, it is critical to distinguish
   between the contributions due to variations in larval settlement versus
   those caused by post-settlement mortality. In this study, fine-scale
   (1-2 days) temporal changes in recruit abundance were followed through
   an entire settlement season in a temperate demersal fish in order to
   determine 1) how dynamic the process of recruitment is on a daily scale,
   2) whether settlement and post-settlement mortality are influenced by
   habitat structure and conspecific density, and 3) how the relationship
   between settlement and recruitment changes over time. `'Settlement'' is
   considered to be the arrival of new individuals from the pelagic
   habitat, and `'recruitment'' is defined as the number of individuals
   surviving arbitrary periods of time after settlement. Replicate
   standardized habitat units were placed in 2 spatial configurations
   (clumped and randomly dispersed) and monitored visually for cunner
   (Tautogolabrus adspersus) settlement and recruitment every 1-2 days
   throughout the settlement season. The process of recruitment in T.
   adspersus was highly variable at a fine temporal scale. Changes in the
   numbers of recruits present on habitat units were due to both settlement
   of new individuals and mortality of animals previously recruited. The
   relative importance of these two processes appeared to change from day
   to day. The magnitude of the change in recruit number did not differ
   between the clumped and random habitats. However, post-settlement loss
   was significantly greater on randomly dispersed than clumped habitats.
   During several sampling dates, the extent of the change in recruit
   abundance was correlated with the density of resident con-specifics;
   however, on other dates no such relationship appeared to exist. Despite
   the presence of significant relationships between the change in recruit
   number and density, there was no evidence of either density-dependent
   mortality or settlement. Initially, there was a strong relationship
   between settlement and recruitment; however, this relationship weakened
   over time. Within 2 months after the cessation of settlement,
   post-settlement loss was greater than 99\%, and no correlation remained
   between recruitment and the initial pattern of settlement. The results
   of this study demonstrate that the spatial arrangement of the habitat
   affects the rate and intensity of post-settlement loss. Counter to much
   current thinking, this study suggests that in order to understand the
   population ecology of reef fishes, knowledge of what habitats new
   recruits use and how mortality varies with structural aspects of the
   habitats is essential.}},

Abstract = {{The initiation of a programme of screening and selection of
   arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM
   fungi) for use as inoculant fungi in agriculture, horticulture of
   forestry will depend on whether inoculation is more appropriate as a
   management option than manipulation of the indigenous mycorrhizal
   populations. The greatest immediate potential for the successful use of
   mycorrhizal inoculants will be in soils and growth media where
   phosphorus (P) limits plant growth and where the indigenous mycorrhizal
   fungi are either ineffective at increasing P uptake by the plant or
   their numbers have been drastically reduced by human influence or
   natural disturbance. In recent investigations, however, additional
   benefits to the plant following colonization of roots by effective AM or
   ECM fungi have been demonstrated. These additional benefits of an
   effective mycorrhizal association have necessitated a re-evaluation of
   the optimum screening procedures for isolates of AM and ECM fungi. Both
   current methodologies and suggestions for alternative approaches to the
   screening of AM and ECM fungi are discussed in this paper. The problems
   inherent in choosing suitable experimental conditions to compare
   different isolates at the screening stage are also addressed. The review
   also stresses the importance of continued monitoring of introduced
   mycorrhizal fungi to learn more about their longer-term ecological role,
   particularly within reforestation or revegetation studies.}},

Abstract = {{We have devised a two-step screening strategy for the selection of
   chloroplast coupling factor reduction mutants from an M(2) population of
   Arabidopsis thaliana. The selection strategy relies on a lowered
   energetic threshold for catalytic activation of the enzyme that has been
   shown to accompany thioredoxin-mediated reduction of a cysteine bridge
   on the gamma subunit of coupling factor. We selected first for plants
   that grew poorly under low irradiance but performed satisfactorily at
   high irradiance when the transmembrane electrochemical potential of
   hydrogen ions is large and competent to maintain a high level of
   coupling factor activation without gamma subunit reduction. In the
   second step of the screen we monitored the flash-induced electrochromic
   change to select putative coupling factor reduction mutants from other
   sorts of mutations that shared the phenotype of poor growth and vigor
   when transferred from high to low irradiance. Among the mutants
   selected, one appears incapable of reducing coupling factor; whereas
   another behaves as though coupling factor is at least partially reduced
   even in dark-adapted plants.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of herbivory were simulated on stands of bilberry (Vaccinium
   myrtillus L.) in a boreal Empetrum-Myrtillus type forest. Five
   harvesting intensities were used (0 \% (A), 25 \% (B), 50 \% (C), 100 \%
   (D) of the bilberry ramets or all the ramets of all species (E)).
   Density and biomass of the stands, and growth of the ramets were
   monitored for five growth seasons, from 1986 to 1990. After damage new
   ramets emerged rapidly from dormant buds at the base of removed ramets.
   Between 70 and 97 \% of the density relative to the control level was
   regained by the final harvest. However, only between 11 and 64 \% of the
   biomass relative to the control level was recovered. Clipping reduced
   the branch growth, both in the new ramets and in the new parts of the
   old, unclipped ramets. Severe treatments (D and E) decreased the growth
   more than did light harvesting (B and C). Survival and fecundity of the
   ramets were not affected. The result therefore suggested that the
   bilberry is not able to recover totally from severe herbivory damage
   between the years of peak rodent population that shows a 3-4 year cycle.
   Nevertheless, extreme grazing pressure is rare in boreal ecosystems as
   alternative food is available for herbivores, and predators also limit
   the herbivore population. Hence the bilberry exhibits moderate tolerance
   of the usual level of herbivory damage.}},

Abstract = {{Predispersal seed predation of the `'biennial'' Carduus nutans L., by
   insects in the southern part of its native European distribution was
   studied as part of a biological control program against this weed for
   Australia.  Three populations of the weed were monitored in detail over
   a 2-4 year period in southern France to quantify levels of seed loss,
   attack patterns and the impact of each capitulum feeding species. 
   Capitulum damage and seed predation reduced seed production by between
   81-99\%.  Four insects were largely responsible for this; the receptacle
   weevils Rhinocyllus conicus, Larinus jaceae and L. sturnus and the
   tephritid gall-fly Urophora solstitialis.
   Seed predation caused a shift of peak seed production from the large
   early capitula to the later more numerous small capitula from the mid to
   late flowering period.  Attack by R. conicus and U. solstitialis was
   spatially dependent on capitulum density of C. nutans among sites. 
   Sites with greater densities of capitula were attacked by a greater
   number of these insects per capitulum.  No such pattern was found at any
   other spatial scale.  The implications of the seed loss on C. nutans
   populations in southern Europe are discussed in relation to other
   factors in the dynamics of this weed.
   Comparisons with existing studies from new environments demonstrate that
   a) predispersal seed predation is much greater in native populations
   than has been described in infestations of this weed in other countries
   where biological control has been successful and b) the main agent of
   this control, R. conicus, is causing similar amounts of seed predation
   in native populations as in countries where it has been released without
   natural enemies.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural activity of Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780) is
   modified by social factors. Interaction between sexually nonexperienced
   (NExp) and experienced (Exp) animals was investigated. Males and females
   were tested in pairs in the male home cage during 10 min encounters.
   Aggressive and nonaggressive behaviour was recorded, and ultrasonic
   vocalization was monitored by a QMC ultrasound detector. The obtained
   results indicate that total activity of Exp females was significantly
   higher than NExp females (p < 0.05). Only females exhibited aggressive
   behaviour toward males, but there was no difference in aggressive
   activity related to sexual experience. Total activity of Exp males was
   higher than that of NExp ones (p < 0.05). Our previous results indicate
   that in adult bank voles only males produce ultrasounds. In these
   experiments significantly more calls was recorded when Exp males were
   tested and compared with NExp males (p < 0.05). This study provides
   additional information about interaction between breeding and
   non-breeding animals in a bank vole population.}},

Abstract = {{Nonhuman primates are essential to the advancement of some areas of
   biomedical research and testing. Some populations of these species in
   the wild may be threatened with extinction because of habitat
   destruction; therefore, the biomedical community has been monitoring
   trends in their importation and use, and supporting various conservation
   activities. During the past 25 years, there has been a marked decrease
   in importations into the United States, a large proportion of which is
   the result of a 1975 ban on their importation for the pet trade. During
   the same period, the need for biomedical purposes has remained fairly
   constant. Nonetheless, the reductions in imports have been augmented by
   the biomedical community through reducing losses during quarantine and
   conditioning, ensuring a more judicious use of these animals, and by
   increasing the availability of animals from breeding programs both in
   source countries and the United States. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   temperatures and structural characteristics of roosts, and used
   emergence counts with night vision equipment and mist netting to monitor
   P. t. virginianus at three maternity roosts and one bachelor roost in
   Kentucky, during 1990, 1991 and 1992. Structural characteristics of
   roosts varied. All colonies selected limestone caves except one that
   used a sandstone rock shelter. There were no differences in internal
   temperatures between the rock shelter roost and a cave roost in summer
   1991. Timing of establishment of maternity colonies varied among roosts.
   Roost abandonment (switching) occurred with maternity colonies in caves.
   Females at the rock shelter roost were pregnant on 10 May and lactating
   on 17 June 1991; young were volant on 5 August. Bimodal activity
   patterns were observed at maternity roosts, except during lactation when
   activity of bats at roost openings persisted throughout the night.
   Population patterns at the bachelor roost were consistent across years.
   Low numbers in the bachelor roost in mid-August coincided with the
   descent of testes and the onset of mating activity.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decades, the Barn Owl population has markedly decreased in
   range and breeding numbers in The Netherlands as in most western
   European countries. For effective conservation and population
   management, it is essential to know which factors are responsible for
   this decline. The present study deals with the Barn Owl population in
   the eastern part of The Netherlands. Population trends and demography
   (productivity, dispersal, mortality) were studied in two different
   districts (Liemers and Achterhoek) over two consecutive nine-year
   periods (1967-75 and 1976-84). Trends in population levels and
   demographic parameters are analysed in relation to external
   (environmental) factors, especially food supply, winter weather
   conditions, nest site availability and changes in rural landscapes and
   in farming practices.
   In Liemers the Barn Owl population has decreased markedly since 1960,
   especially in areas which have been subject to urbanisation and to
   large-scale land consolidation aimed at agricultural intensification. In
   contrast, in Achterhoek the Barn Owl population increased in the period
   1965-85; landscape diversity is much better preserved in this district.
   More Barn Owls breed in small-scale mixed farmland than in large-scale
   uniform farmland. A significant, positive, correlation was found between
   the Barn Owl breeding density and the length of hedgerows, lines of
   trees and woodland edges.
   Both in Liemers and Achterhoek, no clear trends over time were noticed
   as regards breeding performance, dispersal patterns and mortality in
   adult Barn Owls. However, first-year mortality in Liemers in the second
   period (1976-84) proved to be higher than in the first period (1967-84)
   and in both periods in Achterhoek, In Liemers, productivity was too low
   to compensate for the high mortality in which road deaths took a heavy
   toll. This district proved to be a `sink area', where the Barn Owl
   population persists only due to continuous net imports of owls. In
   contrast, Achterhoek is a `source area' where productivity exceeds
   mortality. The relative importance of the various demographic parameters
   for the population balance is presented in a diagram (Fig. 25), which
   also gives a quantitative assessment of the sink (Liemers) and the
   source (Achterhoek).
   The key factors which limit Barn Owl numbers proved to be time- and
   region-dependent. In the 1980s, a continuing decline took place in the
   most devastated landscapes of Liemers, accounted for by progressive
   agricultural intensification and also by urbanisation and the expansion
   of the main road network. In contrast, the Barn Owl population increased
   in the better preserved mixed farmland of Achterhoek. The loss in nest
   site availability in the study region (which was great in the early
   years of the study period) has been offset by a major nestbox campaign,
   which proved to be very successful. Today over 90\% of the Barn Owl
   pairs in Liemers and Achterhoek use these nestboxes for breeding. The
   mean number of young raised in nestboxes was significantly higher than
   that of `free' nest sites. In Liemers the improved nest site
   availability could not stop the population decline. The proximate
   factors causing this decline are the loss of foraging habitat
   (disappearance of vole-rich areas, large-scale reduction of hedgerows)
   and the sharply increased traffic density (causing high road mortality
   rates). In the small-scale mixed farmland of Achterhoek, however, the
   Barn Owl population grew in parallel with the increased supply of
   nestboxes. This supports evidence that nest site availability is the
   environmental limiting factor in well-preserved landscapes with a rich
   and buffered food supply. The relationships between the most important
   external (environmental) factors and the main internal (demographic)
   parameters, as found in this study for the 1980s, are presented in a
   diagram (Fig. 35).
   A number of recommendations can be made for the protection of the Barn
   Owl and its habitat. These are summarized at the end of this article.
   Conservation measures should be linked to a land use strategy which
   favours not only the Barn Owl, but also broader conservation interests
   including historic-cultural values and the scenery in the wider
   countryside. Such a strategy will be profitable for other endangered
   birds and other scarce species associated with farmland. Monitoring of
   population trends of breeding birds in the study region showed that
   birds from seminatural habitats (open water, marshland, woodland) are
   relatively safe if they are non-migratory or winter in Europe. In
   contrast, many species breeding in farmland are threatened, in which
   Africa-migrants run double risks. There are better prospects for
   farmland birds with limited dispersals, such as the Barn Owl,
   Conservation measures regarding the local habitat (increasing the
   diversity in farmland environments including the supply of appropriate
   nest sites) certainly offer an opportunity for maintaining and
   increasing their breeding populations within a relatively short period
   of time (10-15 years).}},

   for several years in a paddock near Ross, Tasmania. The population
   declined dramatically during the extremely dry summer of 1987, and also
   experienced high mortality in the dry summer of 1988. Adult plants and
   germinates were more abundant in grazed than in ungrazed plots for most
   of the period after this decline. The development of axillary branches
   on adult plants was much more prominent outside than inside the
   exclosures. Seedling establishment preferentially occurred on ground
   dominated by herbs, with establishment being low and extremely brief on
   grass-covered ground. The frequently disturbed margins of the exclosures
   were the most favourable sites for establishment of new individuals. The
   future of this unpalatable rare species seems to be dependent upon
   management that maintains open and, preferably, disturbed ground.}},

   on data (1980-92) from the algal, water quality and flow monitoring
   programmes of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission; cell densities and
   community composition are discussed in relation to flow, turbidity,
   temperature and nutrients.
   Of 102 taxa from seven classes recorded in the 628 phytoplankton
   samples, only seven taxa occurred in > 30\% of samples and 55 taxa
   occurred in < 1\% of samples. Total cell densities remained below 10 000
   cells mL(-1) for around 70\% of the study period. The population was
   characterized by the presence of Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae and
   the irregular development of cyanobacterial blooms. Eight genera of
   cyanobacteria contributed to 17 population peaks exceeding 10 000 cells
   mL(-1). Ten of these peaks occurred during a low-flow period from April
   1985 to June 1988 when turbidity was usually less than 50 NTU, and two
   were recorded at river temperatures of less than 14 degrees C.
   Total cell density and community composition had no apparent seasonal
   pattern but had five distinct phases related to flow and turbidity.
   Seasonal temperature cycles and availability of nutrients appear to be
   less important than flow and turbidity in determining the longer-term
   variations observed in the algal population.}},

Abstract = {{Growth rates and changes in body composition of pups were monitored
   during the 3-week lactation period of southern elephant seals at
   Macquarie Island.  Despite a slight decrease in weight in the first days
   post-partum, pups attained a mass of 114+/-16.6 kg (mean+/-s.d.) at
   weaning, representing an average growth rate of 3.53+/-0.80 kg day-1
   over the entire lactation period.  The proportion of body mass
   represented by fat was less than 3\% at birth, increasing to
   40.8+/-12.7\% at weaning.  Lean tissue mass altered little for most of
   the lactation period, but did show an increase in the last four days. 
   The fat content of the milk reflected these changes, starting at
   16.1+/-6.98\% on Day 1 of lactation and increasing to 39.5+/-15.2\%
   about the time of weaning.  Fat content of the milk was, however, highly
   variable and at weaning ranged from 7\% to 55\%.  Although the growth
   rate of the pup was correlated with mass lost by its mother during
   lactation, there was no relationship between maternal mass and weaning
   weight of pups.  It is suggested that growth rates may be related to
   maternal condition and not simply mass, and, further, that differences
   in growth rates between populations of southern elephant seals are
   related to maternal energy reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Sticky blue traps are a suitable and important tool for Western Flower
   Thrips population monitoring in greenhouses.  They can be used in
   vegetables and in ornamentals, and provide important information on the
   current status of the pest population.  However, such traps cannot be
   used in some susceptible plant species when they are flowering because
   at that stage the plants are more attractive to Western Flower Thrips
   than the traps.  We therefore tried to increase trap attractiveness by
   combining the colour cue with an attractive odour cue.  In laboratory
   experiments, we found a significant additive effect on attractiveness
   for two odours in traps provided with both the visual and the olfactory
   cues as compared to traps with either cue alone.  However, these results
   could not easily be reproduced in greenhouses.  The main factors
   responsible for this failure seem to be (1) the only moderate, additive
   increase of trap attractiveness when using combined visual and olfactory
   cues, and (2) the problems associated with odour diffusion.  Unless a
   more attractive odour is found and a suitable odour dispenser is
   available, the use of odours to enhance sticky blue trap attractiveness
   for Western Flower Thrips cannot be recommended and, given the added
   cost for the trap, may not be affordable for growers.}},

Abstract = {{The desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii is federally listed as Threatened
   because of documented declines in some populations, yet the proximate
   causes of these declines are not well understood. With use of
   radiotelemetry, I monitored a total of 55 individual tortoises at two
   Mojave Desert sites over three years. Both populations suffered high
   adult mortality during an extreme drought period, but the temporal
   pattern and inferred proximate causes of mortality differed between
   sites. At the eastern Mojave site, no telemetered tortoises died in 1988
   or 1989, but 41\% died in 1990. All nine carcasses were found and only
   one showed any evidence of predation or scavenging. Tortoises that died
   had symptoms of dehydration (high plasma osmolality) and/or starvation
   (high blood urea, as compared to tortoises that survived). Mortality in
   the eastern Mojave population thus seems to have been due to
   physiological stress associated with drought and concomitant lack of
   forage. In contrast, western Mojave tortoises that died did not appeal
   physiologically stressed, and all carcasses found showed evidence of
   predation ol scavenging. Strong circumstantial evidence implicated
   predation by coyotes, but respiratory disease may also have been a
   factor. Annual adult mortality in the western Mojave population was at
   least 5-25\% in each of three rears. High mortality in both populations
   was attributable to `natural' effects of drought, directly in the
   eastern Mojave through starvation and dehydration, and indirectly in the
   western Mojave through functional responses of predators to a diminished
   prey base and, possibly, increased susceptibility of tortoises to
   disease. Episodic, drought-related high mortality has probably occurred
   repeatedly in the evolutionary history of G. agassizii, but human
   exploitation of the desert may exacerbate natural stresses, and recovery
   of populations is likely to be slow, In the absence of long-term data
   sufficient to evaluate the relative importance of potential causes of
   population declines, a conservative management strategy is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The kakapo Strigops habroptilus is a large, flightless, nocturnal
   parrot, endemic to New Zealand. Once abundant throughout New Zealand
   approximately 50 individuals now remain. In situ conservation of natural
   populations has proved impracticable, and recent conservation efforts
   have concentrated on establishing safe populations by translocating
   wild-caught kakapo to offshore islands without significant predators.
   The translocation method, developed to minimise transit time, was to
   attach radio-transmitters to free-living kakapo, recapture the
   radio-tagged birds for transfer when air transport was available and
   liberate them immediately upon arrival at the island. Between 1974 and
   1992 65 kakapo were translocated to four of New Zealand's offshore
   islands (Maud, Little Barrier, Codfish, and Mana). Few, if any, kakapo
   now remain within their former range. Regular monitoring and intensive
   management of the translocated populations is being undertaken. Between
   63 and 85\% of translocated kakapo have survived but thus far
   productivity has been low, only two young having survived to
   independence.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of a plan for management and habitat restoration of a rare
   fern Marsilea villosa endemic to Hawai'i showed that the plant was
   capable of reestablishing itself under certain conditions without
   intensive management. In this case degradation of the population was
   caused by a series of unusually dry years combined with damage from
   off-road vehicles. As a result the litter layer deteriorated and exposed
   soil was colonized mainly by alien weeds. Under near-normal climatic
   conditions, including periodic flooding, the endemic plant was able to
   grow vigorously and successfully exclude most competitors. A program of
   labor-intensive weeding ultimately proved to be an unnecessary measure
   to protect the plant from possible extinction ai the site where the
   largest and healthiest population occurs. Reliable data, collected by
   known and replicable methods, are needed to monitor the condition of
   rare species and to plan efficient management or habitat restoration
   should it be necessary.}},

   different plant species and in some cases between districts. The extent
   of debarking pattern also differed significantly between Sanctuary West
   (13.2\%), National Park (7.7\%) and Sanctuary East (none observed).
   Thirteen plant species were affected. The debarking pattern for
   different girth classes differed significantly in Sanctuary West and
   National Park. High plant mortality and debarking have several

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{203-215}},
Abstract = {{Three areas in the Great Lakes region are known to harbor species whose
   primary range is the coastal plain: (1) the southeastern Georgian Bay
   region of Ontario, (2) the sandplains near Lake Michigan in southwestern
   Michigan and northern Indiana, and (3) the lacustrine sand deposits in
   central and northern Wisconsin. Secondary areas with smaller
   concentrations are found in the southeastern Lake Ontario region of New
   York, the Lake Erie region, small areas of north-central Illinois, and
   local areas of northern Michigan. These areas are all sand deposits
   associated with postglacial lakes and drainage channels. A review of the
   flora of the Great Lakes region disclosed a list of 62 primarily coastal
   plain species that are disjunct to the Great Lakes region.
   The species are largely herbs, nearly half are graminoids, and many are
   annuals. Their habitats are primarily sandy, gravelly, or peaty emergent
   shores of shallow, soft-water ponds and small lakes with fluctuating
   water levels, or sometimes sandy, periodically flooded swales. A few
   species are aquatic, and fewer still are bog or wet forest species. Most
   are evident only during years of low water levels, and sometimes their
   appearance is quite sporadic, making survey and monitoring work
   difficult. However, the consequences of loss of populations can be
   severe since, with disjuncts, there may be no seed source nearby to
   facilitate recolonization of sites. The sandy lakeshore habitats are
   frequently prime recreational lands, thus creating additional pressures.
   Previous hypotheses for the occurrence of these disjuncts suggested
   gradual migration along the shores of postglacial lakes and drainages.
   However, these species do not typically inhabit shores of rivers and
   large lakes. As well, habitats along these shores undoubtedly were not
   continuous. Nevertheless, the localized occurrence of the species at the
   termini of major postglacial drainages in spite of the more widespread
   availability of apparently suitable habitats argues against random long
   distance dispersaL Here proposed is that these species migrated into the
   Great Lakes region through dispersal jumps of varying distances between
   substantial areas of suitable habitat created along major postglacial
   drainage channels. Once in the Great Lakes area, they were most
   successful in areas with extensive drying shorelines.}},

Abstract = {{The population of an endangered, endemic Hawaiian honeycreeper, the
   Laysan Finch Telespiza cantans, has been censused over 23 years using
   strip transects. During 1986-1988, multiple censuses were made.
   Vegetation type, breeding cycle stage, and variability among individual
   counters influenced the transect counts during those three years. During
   the breeding peak, the population appeared to be undercounted
   (presumably because females were not seen) and was most evenly
   distributed throughout the major vegetation types. Variability among
   individual counters was significant, but was not explained by previous
   census experience.
   The breeding season population estimate declined by one-half in the year
   following a drought. There was no overall population trend over the 23
   years. Major refinement of census techniques would be difficult to
   justify due to logistic constraints and the need to minimize ecosystem
   damage. We conclude that strip transects are adequate for monitoring
   gross changes in this population, especially if breeding stage is known.}},

Abstract = {{When assessing human exposures to pesticides or other toxicants, ambient
   monitoring is often supplemented with measurements of the toxicant's
   concentration in a tissue or body fluid in order to more accurately
   estimate exposure to internal targets. Tissue analysis is routinely
   carried out despite the uncertainty of the quantitative relationship
   between the amount of toxicant in a tissue and the intensity/duration of
   the human exposure. Classical toxicological studies, using experimental
   animals, do not substantially contribute to identifying and
   characterizing the uncertainties associated with human exposure
   assessments. There is a need to replace or supplement tissue burden
   determinations with measurements that will make more tangible
   contributions to quantitative exposure assessments. To fill this need,
   major emphasis is being placed on (1) the development of physiologically
   based pharmacokinetic models for simulating internal exposures, and (2)
   measuring, directly or indirectly, target tissue exposures. This paper
   examines the relationship of tissue or body burden to internal exposure
   for an organophosphate pesticide (EPN), a metal (Pb), and a volatile
   organic compound (benzene), and considers alternative approaches to more
   cost-effective exposure assessment in the general population.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria have the capacity for bioremediation of both volatile and
   non-volatile organic compounds. Plants support a rhizosphere microflora,
   enhance soil microbial populations and may also be able themselves to
   metabolize some hazardous organic compounds. Plants move large amounts
   of water by transpiration and for volatile compounds, intersystem
   transfer by transpiration might occur when plants are exposed to such
   materials. These possibilities were tested experimentally. A tank with a
   channel width of 10 cm and a depth of 35 cm was used for plant growth.
   Alfalfa plants were supplied with a subsoil water source saturated c.
   500ppm) with toluene or containing c. 500 ppm phenol. Sampling wells
   were used to monitor the depth of the water table and concentrations of
   toluene and phenol in the ground water.
   The toluene concentration in the ground water remained constant or
   decreased slightly during passage of water through the tank although
   there was an average net input of >300 mg toluene per day to the system.
   To measure toluene losses through volatilization or transpiration, the
   tank was covered with an aluminum and glass enclosure and monitored
   using Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy. The gas phase
   toluene was below the limit of detection by FTIR (c. 250 ppb v/v) while
   the expected accumulation of toluene based on water evapotranspiration
   rate was >50 ppm v/v increase in the gas phase concentration per hour.
   Thus, only a small to nil fraction of the input toluene arrived in the
   gas phase.
   With phenol, the concentration in the aqueous phase decreased during
   passage through the tank. Phenol is much less volatile than water and it
   was undetectable in the gas phase. The amount of input contaminants was
   about 100 fold above the amount that could be physically adsorbed to
   soil organic matter in this system. The observed mass balance suggests
   that effective degradation of toluene and phenol occurs in this system
   and that the potential intersystem transfer of volatile organics
   transpiration is not a problem, at least with adapted plants.}},

Abstract = {{In situ biotreatment of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
   contaminated clay soils is a challenge. A grass-enhanced bioremediation
   system was conceived as a relatively passive but potentially effective
   remediation method. Our laboratory studies to date have shown that a
   statistically significant increase in PAH removal is possible through
   the use of a grass-enhanced system. A field demonstration for
   grass-enhanced bioremediation for PAH contaminated soil is being
   conducted for a 2-yr period at a Union Carbide Plant. The objective is
   to evaluate, at pilot-scale level, the ability of a fibrous root system
   to facilitate the bioremediation of PAH in clay soils typical in the
   Gulf Coast area. The performance of the process is being evaluated by
   comparison of the PAH concentration reductions in soil planted with
   `Prairie' Buffalograss to that in soil in the absence of grass. This
   pilot study will determine degradation kinetics of PAH compounds,
   formation of toxic metabolites, and the influence of soil
   characteristics and microbial populations in the field. Soil gas and
   solid phase of the top soil zone as well as the groundwater in the
   upmost aquifer are being monitored. A parallel experiment is being
   conducted to assess the performance of twelve warm-season grass species
   with various genetic origins. Randomized, complete block experiments
   were designed to appraise the effect of individual grass species. The
   visual differences in grass germination, establishment, survival,
   density, height, and root depth are being observed.}},

   accuracy (i.e., indications of impact when impact occurred; no
   indications of impact when impact did not occur), and taxonomic effort
   required (e.g., from simple discrimination among taxa to generic
   identification of taxa and determination of trophic status).  Based on
   54 samples from a uniform riffle of a California mountain stream,
   coefficients of variation ranged from 7\% for Simpson's diversity index
   to greater than 100\% for several measures.  Richness measures,
   Margalef's diversity index, the Family Biotic Index, and the ratio of
   individuals of the scraper functional-feeding group to total number of
   individuals were accurate in detecting acid and thermal stress (i.e.,
   statistically significant differences were found) but did not indicate

Abstract = {{Amphibians have proved to be especially useful for monitoring
   environmental conditions:  in fact, during their life cycle they
   alternate a double array of morpho-functional characters which make
   larvae fit for freshwater environments and adults fit for the
   terrestrial ones.  The low vagility of amphibian populations and the
   development of adaptive strategies more similar to those of
   invertebrates than to those of tetrapods, allow the exploitation of
   these organisms as sensitive bioindicators of the environmental
   conditions; however these same characters appear to expose them to a
   decline that, in the opinion of some scientists, is global, involving
   areas of our planet which have not yet been altered by human action. 
   Among the numerous adaptations that make these amphibians closely
   dependent on environmental factors there are some cytogenetic
   characters.  It is well-known that these vertebrates exhibit genome
   sizes covering the widest range of values in the subphylum.  Variations
   in their nuclear DNA amount appear to be inversely proportional to
   changes in their cell metabolic rate and parallel the occurrence of
   heterochrony during morphogenesis.  In urodeles, the largest genomes are
   shown by permanently neotenic species or by species involved in wide
   ontogenetic repatterning by progenesis.  In anurans, the range of
   variability is more restricted; however, the largest genomes are found
   in terrestrial species with direct development, undergoing progenetic
   processes.  Therefore, in amphibians, adaptation appears to involve also
   their nuclear characters; the rapid environmental changes occurring in
   the last decades may affect also the cytogenetic characters of these
   organisms, and contribute to their global decline.}},

   communities play an important role in the process of transforming the

Abstract = {{Changes in standing crop, reproductive status and structure of a
   population of Xiphophora gladiata at Katiki Point, Otago, New Zealand
   were monitored over a 12 month period. Plants were reproductive for 8
   months of the year with the peak reproductive activity being found over
   the winter (July/August) months. The greatest number of reproductive
   plants were found in the largest size classes with plants usually being
   15 cm in length before forming receptacles. Peak reproductive activity
   increased at the same time as tissue nitrogen and mannitol levels and
   may be linked. A significant seasonal variation in biomass was found
   with maximal levels in autumn (March-May). Biomass levels were
   correlated with tissue mannitol levels and with seawater ammonia and
   phosphate levels. This study provides a platform for describing patterns
   on broader temporal and spatial scales and has suggested some factors
   for targeted experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The replenishment of coral trout populations was monitored by daily
   sampling for pelagic juveniles using automated light-traps anchored at
   three sites close to the crests of two reefs (Arlington, Green) in the
   Cairns Region of the Great Barrier Reef. The water depth at each site
   was approximately 25 m; traps were suspended at 1 m and 20 m. A total of
   237 presettlement coral trout were captured during the 1990/1991
   spawning season of which the majority were identified as Plectropomus
   leopardus. Four individuals were grown out to confirm generic
   identification. Pelagic juveniles were collected from both depths but
   were consistently more abundant at the surface. They were also
   consistently more abundant at Arlington than Green. Standard length was
   16.8 +/- 0.2 (95\% CL) mm with no trends in size among depths, reefs,
   sites or time. All presettlement trout were caught during a 17 day time
   window centered around the new moon in November 1990. A similar pattern
   of replenishment was generated by back-calculating the settlement dates
   of 36 juveniles collected from the reef at the end of summer. These
   back-calculations also estimated pelagic larval duration as 25.2 +/- 0.9
   (95\% CL) days, indicating birth dates near the previous new moon. This
   was consistent with systematic observations on trout spawning at Scott
   Reef, which lies 40 km downstream of Arlington. Since Scott was
   obviously not the source of the fish captured in our study, synchrony
   between spawning and recruitment at this scale suggests that
   reproduction may be regionally entrained, and that all replenishment in
   this season was sourced from one period of spawning lasting about 2
   weeks.}},

   constructed over a mountain ash tree and provided with thousands of host

   open release of 368 P. geniculata cocoons, obtained as larvae from the
   field cage and presumably parasitized by O. geniculatae, was made in
   1986 at Pasadena in western Newfoundland. Olesicampe geniculatae rapidly
   established in the St. John's area where host populations dropped to
   insignificant levels by 1990. Island-wide monitoring during 1989 and
   1990 indicated that O. geniculatae had spread to the west and south
   coasts, at rates as high as 50 km per year. Effective and persistent
   suppression of P. geniculata by O. geniculatae is anticipated.}},

Abstract = {{We incubated snapping turtle eggs at extreme levels of temperature and
   moisture to test the hypothesis that incubation conditions limit the
   species' range by affecting hatching success and posthatching survival
   and growth. We also tested for local adaptations to cold incubation
   conditions by comparing the responses of embryos and hatchlings from a
   population near the northern Limit of the species' range with those from
   a population farther south. Eggs of 20 clutches from two Ontario
   populations were incubated at 21.1 or 25.3 degrees C at one of three
   substrate moisture levels (-150, -300, -800 kPa), and hatchling survival
   and growth were monitored in the laboratory for 23 months. Hatching
   success, hatchling survival, and posthatching growth were lowest among
   turtles from eggs incubated at 21.1 degrees C. They were also
   uncoordinated and had poor control of their buoyancy. Hatching success
   was reduced in the drier substrates, but posthatching survival and
   growth were not affected by substrate moisture. Embryo and hatchling
   survival were lower in turtles from the southern population (which may
   be related to contaminants in the eggs) but hatchlings from that
   population grew the fastest. Hatching success at 21.1 degrees C or in
   the driest substrate did not differ between the two populations, but
   embryos from the northern population did show a greater increase in
   mortality at 21.1 degrees C relative to 25.3 degrees C than embryos from
   the more southerly population. The effects of lower incubation
   temperatures may be the most important factor limiting the northern
   distribution of this species, because lower temperatures during
   incubation and a shorter growing season probably reduce both the
   quantity and quality of hatchling turtles produced at northern sites.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic monitoring of nesting and fledging of American White Pelicans
   (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) breeding on the Molly Islands In Yellowstone
   Lake was carried on for 20 years between 1966 and 1987. The mean number
   of pelicans fledged during those fears was 214 (+/-196 SD). In five of
   those years the number of pelicans fledged was at or near zero. In six
   other years, the number of young pelicans fledged ranged from 302-650,
   with four of those years producing record numbers of successfully
   fledged young. Maximum seasonal levels of Yellowstone Lake reaching 1.6
   m or more produced complete or near complete reproductive failures.
   Conversely, years with maximum lake levels never reaching 1.4 m were
   most likely to have very good to outstanding fledging success. Also,
   numbers of days when air temperatures of -8.8 degrees C or colder and
   daily temperature minimums of -16.6 degrees C, as well as the duration
   of ice cover on Yellowstone Lake were important modifiers of the numbers
   of pelicans fledged. Unexpected crustal deformations adjacent to and
   within the Yellowstone Lake basin induced flooding, representing serious
   geologic threats to the long-term well being of the Molly Island pelican
   colony. A baseline breeding population of 546 (+/- 183 SD) adult
   pelicans Was calculated to have supported this Molly Island colony.
   Also, the percentage of population change in the computed annual life
   cycle for 1966-87 was +5\%.}},

Abstract = {{The Louisiana Coastal area supports a large population of colonial
   seabirds. For many seabird species, a significant percentage Of the
   United States' population breeds along the Louisiana coast. We monitored
   the status of seabird colonies along a portion of coastal Louisiana from
   1985 to 1992. The habitats used by seabirds in our study area can be
   divided roughly into marsh and beach sites. Forster's Terns (Sterna
   forsteri) were found only in the marsh colonies, and Laughing culls
   (Larus atricilla) were found in both marsh and beach habitats. All other
   seabird species were found in beach colonies only. Population trends are
   different for each species and seem to be strongly correlated to the
   availability of suitable habitat. Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus
   occidentalis), Royal Terns (Sterna maxima) and Sandwich Terns (Sterna
   sandvicensis) have a low turnover of colony sites. These low turnover
   rates seem to be more related to the relative rareness Of suitable
   nesting sites for these species than to the stability of these habitats.
   Both Forster's Terns and Least Terns (Sterna antillarum) have relatively
   high turnover rates, likely due to the instability of the nesting
   habitat used by these species. However, turnover rates of colonies in
   Louisiana are comparable to rates reported for colonies of the same
   species elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a major waterborne disease agent with
   worldwide distribution. The main transmission route of HAV is direct
   person-to-person contact. However, hepatitis A (HA) outbreaks associated
   with the consumption and use of fecally contaminated water were reported
   from many countries. Studies on the environmental behavior of HAV were
   feasible only after developing techniques for its cultivation and
   enumeration in tissue culture. This study reviews data on the extent of
   HAV prevalence and persistence in the environment and water. HA is
   highly prevalent in low socioeconomic populations as determined by
   seroepidemiologic studies. HAV is excreted for long periods by infected
   individuals, but it is also shed by healthy persons. HAV has been
   detected in concentrated wastewater and natural waters. However, in most
   cases the natural waters were monitored for the presence of HAV after
   the occurrence of HA outbreak. HAV persists for months at temperatures
   below 10 degrees C and for at least 1 month at ambient temperature (20
   to 25 degrees C). Physical, biological, and chemical factors that
   influence the survival of enteric viruses - such as temperature, pH,
   salt concentration, microbial activity, and humidity - have similar
   effects on HAV. Drinking water treatment processes such as coagulation,
   high rate filtration, and disinfection seem to be effective in removing
   HAV from water.}},

Abstract = {{Movement and settlement patterns of animal offspring, along with the
   costs of occupying familiar and unfamiliar habitats, have been inferred
   frequently, but rarely have they been documented directly. To obtain
   such information, we monitored the individual fates of 205 (94\%) of the
   219 offspring born over 3 yr in a population of the North American red
   squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), at Fort Assiniboine, Alberta, Canada
   (54.20 degrees N, 114.45 degrees W). We located neonates by
   radio-tracking mother squirrels, and thereafter we documented the
   movements, survival, and settlement patterns of the offspring, using a
   combination of telemetry, live-trapping, and visual observations. Prior
   to settlement, offspring made forays of up to 900 m ((X) over bar = 126
   m) off the natal territory, but they did not abandon the natal territory
   until they had settled on their own territory. Foray distance was not
   related to the age or size of the offspring. We used the locations of
   offspring kills to show that the risk of predation significantly
   increased when the offspring were travelling off of their natal
   territories. Just under half of the 73 offspring that acquired
   territories did so on or immediately adjacent to their mother's; the
   farthest settlement distance was only 323 m from the natal territory, or
   about the distance of three territory widths. Movement data from adults
   in the population showed that all offspring settled within potential
   contact of their mother (and possibly their father). Offspring that
   settled relatively farther away from their natal territory were more
   likely to obtain larger territories, with traditional hoarding and
   overwintering sites (middens). These offspring also had higher
   overwinter survival, suggesting that the costs of making forays off the
   natal territory may be balanced by the advantages of locating a superior
   territory.}},

Abstract = {{Larval parasitism of Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen) was monitored
   during six years in field samples from within the outbreak range of E.
   autumnata in northern Fennoscandia, and outside it in southern Finland.
   All parasitoids found were hymenopterans. Six phenologically early
   species of parasitoids were found in populations within the outbreak
   range and three species outside the outbreak range. Two late larval
   parasitoid species were found within the outbreak range, but none
   outside the outbreak range. In half of the populations within the
   outbreak range, early larval parasitoids seemed to increase with a time
   lag. This is consistent with the cyclic population fluctuations of E.
   autumnata there. On a small spatial scale (among trees), however,
   parasitoids acted without a time lag. Parasitism rates by the early
   larval parasitoids are probably too low (mean 11\%) for early
   parasitoids alone to keep densities of E. autumnata continuously at low
   levels outside the outbreak range in southern Finland.}},

Abstract = {{Guangzhou is a major city in South China and is at the forefront of
   economic reform since 1978. The population of Guangzhou is rapidly
   increasing and most people either walk or cycle to and froM Work. These
   commuters are highly vulnerable to vehicular emissions. An indirect
   approach was adopted to estimate vehicular emission exposure to
   Guangzhou bicycle commuters. Four bus routes were selected as typical
   commuting routes. Concentrations of NO(x) and CO as well as traffic
   volume, vehicle speed, ground-level wind speed, and direction were
   measured at monitoring points set up along the routes of typical street
   links passing through areas of various land uses. CO and NO(x) were
   recognized to be two major vehicular emission pollutants. The average CO
   exposure levels of Guangzhou bicycle commuters ranged from 3.7 muL/L to
   8.2 muL/L. Few CO samples exceeded the Chinese national assessment
   standard. No adverse effect on health was expected. The average NO.
   exposure levels of Guangzhou bicycle commuters ranged from 0.13 muL/L to
   0.26 muL/L. More than half of the NO(x) samples exceeded the Chinese
   national assessment standard. Adverse effects on the health of bicycle
   commuters might result. Other factors such as street configurations and
   land uses were also analyzed.}},

   exposed occupationally to low-dose benzene, and of 42 controls. The role
   of smoking habit as a confounding factor of genotoxic effects caused by
   occupational low-dose benzene exposure was also studied. The benzene
   concentrations in the ambient air samples varied from 3 to 20 mg/m3
   (mean: 7 mg/m3). The continuous low-dose benzene exposure significantly
   increased the CA and SCE frequencies, but did not influence PRI. Smoking
   levels were characterized by subjective accounts and by serum
   thiocyanate concentrations (SCN). CA and SCE were not significantly
   increased in smokers compared to nonsmokers, but the differences were
   expressed to a greater extent in the case of measurement of SCN
   concentrations. Determination of SCN proved to be more objective in the
   assessment of genotoxic effects of smoking as a confounding factor of

Abstract = {{In October-December 1990, the large barbs (Barbus) that contribute more
   than 35 \% of the catch in lake Tana (northern Ethiopia) were studied.
   Previous authors (Ruppell 1837, Boulenger 1902, 1911, Bini 1940)
   described from 6 to 23 (sub)species for the lake. Banister (1973) lumped
   all of these into one subspecies: Barbus intermedius intermedius
   Ruppell,1837. We found that the Lake Tana Barbus could be readily
   categorized in at least 13 discrete morphotypes, some of which were
   already distinguished by local fishermen. None of the known descriptions
   are adequate to distinguish the barbs unambiguously, which is important
   for monitoring and management of developing fisheries. Intermediates
   between morphotypes were rare (< 10\%). By applying canonical
   discriminant analysis on a set of 17 morphometric characters (including
   some directly associated with feeding) our initial
   morphotype-distinction was confirmed. Also, differences between the
   morphotypes in distribution, related to depth and substratum were found,
   as well as differences in intestinal contents, a key to the food-niche.
   The high number of piscivorous morphotypes (8 out of 13) was striking as
   piscivory is relatively rare among cyprinids. Piscivory was found to be
   highly correlated with morphological (feeding related) characters. The
   presence of discrete morphotypes, that also differ in food-niche and
   distribution, strongly suggests that several distinct populations exist,
   that may be (partly or completely) reproductively segregated. Knowledge
   about these populations, that may represent separate units of fish
   stock, is of crucial importance for the management of sustainable
   fisheries and protection of the biodiversity in Lake Tana. It is
   possible that several species or even a unique cyprinid species flock an
   present, that urgently need protection.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to characterize the spatial, seasonal and
   annual hepatic activities of mixed-function oxidase (MFO) in the
   speckled sanddab Citharichthys stigmaeus, the most common fish in the
   Moss Landing area. In addition, techniques to monitor MFO activities in
   caged speckled sanddabs were developed and tested. Once the relationship
   between MFO activities in caged and wild fish populations is determined,
   caged fish could be used to monitor potential hydrocarbon impacts at
   Moss Landing or other marine sites. During each of the spatial, seasonal
   and annual sediment samplings conducted in 1985-1987 as part of a
   separate hydrocarbon variability study at Moss Landing, 12 wild speckled
   sanddabs were collected from Moss Landing Harbor, Elkhorn Slough and
   nearshore Monterey Bay sites. In addition, four locations were chosen
   for a 14-day field caged fish experiment. The caged fish experiments
   successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using caged sanddabs as
   indicators of hydrocarbon exposure. The major source of variability in
   hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in wild speckled sanddabs
   from the Moss Landing area is due to seasonal rather than site
   differences. Significant relationships between caged fish MFO response
   and sediment hydrocarbon concentrations were found It is possible that
   caged fish could be used in place of costly sediment sampling and
   analysis, and provide a more direct method to assess biological impacts.
   Many of the caging techniques demonstrated in this study can easily be
   transferred to other benthic flatfish, and other marine and freshwater
   environments.}},

Journal = {{EUPHYTICA}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{The cool season food legumes are seriously affected by diseases and
   pests that collectively cause yield reductions variously estimated at
   over 50\% on a world wide basis. The use of host plant resistance to
   increase and stabilize yields depends on a well planned plant breeding
   program, i.e., germplasm evaluation, hybridization with otherwise
   adapted material, and screening and selection methods that efficiently
   identify segregants with combined resistance to multiple diseases and
   insect pests. Sequential and simultaneous screening has successfully
   combined resistance to Ascochyta blight and Fusarium wilt of chickpea;
   Fusarium wilt, powdery mildew, and viruses of pea; and Fusarium wilt and
   rust of lentil.
   Resistance has generally been durable for the soilborne diseases;
   however, resistance to Ascochyta blight has often been overcome by new
   pathotypes. Resistance to powdery mildew, pea enation mosaic and other
   viruses has been durable. Some of the most serious biotic stresses of
   the cool season food legumes remain as chronic production constraints.
   These include Aphanomyces root rot of pea, rust and Ascochyta blight of
   lentil, root rot of chickpea, chocolate spot of faba bean, and Orobanche
   ssp. that parasitize all of the cool season food legumes.
   The use of host plant resistance to control insect pests is almost
   non-existent; however, resistance to Heliocoverpa and leaf miner of
   chickpea has been identified and work is underway toward developing
   resistant cultivars. The control of Bruchus spp. and Sitona spp. through
   host plant resistance remains as a remote possibility.
   Cultivars which are resistant or tolerant to one or more biotic stresses
   are a critical component of integrated pest management. Decisions as to
   crop rotations, monitoring of field populations of pathogens or insects,
   pesticides or biological control agents, tillage, planting dates, method
   of planting, and other factors can all be critical to reducing the
   effects of biotic stresses. Successful production of cool season food
   legumes appears to depend on the creation of cultivars with genetic
   resistance to one or more pests followed by management decisions
   designed to delay development of pathotypes or biotypes capable of
   overcoming the available resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Lepidoptera populations were monitored during 29 years by a light-trap
   in urban Brno. Compared with other sites in the Czech Republic
   (Prague-Ruzyne, Ceske Budejovice, Cernis) urban Brno was extraordinarily
   rich in species, richer than the other Czech sites studied and richer
   than many British sites in an urban to natural gradient. Variability of
   the more common species at Brno was as high as that at the
   ruderal/deteriorated agricultural setting at Ceske Budejovice, and
   generally higher than that in the wet forest environment at Cernis and
   much higher than in the park-like/suburban/agricultural setting of
   Prague. Voltinism had no effect on variability from year to year. Most
   of the more common species in Brno clearly increased in abundance over
   the years, unlike those at the other sites. Much of the large diversity
   at Brno, however, was because of a large number of accidental species,
   vagrants from elsewhere. When considering only the more common species
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 5 individuals per year), however, Brno is
   among the most species-poor sites. The common species at Brno were
   mostly tramp species that could take advantage of whatever food and
   habitat the city had to offer.
   Because of strong correlations in abundance between species at one site
   with conspecifics at other sites over distances of 150-200 km, the
   abundances in these populations are apparently strongly affected by
   large-scale processes such as weather, overriding in part large
   differences between the habitats or by large-scale dispersal of
   individuals between sites. Significant correlations also existed between
   conspecifics in these sites in variability as well as in trends in time,
   with the curious exception of Cernis, the only reasonably natural
   habitat, suggesting that these parameters are strongly affected by local
   habitat characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) was first recorded
   in Ireland in 1858 and is confined to the mid and south west of the
   country. The national population is estimated to be around 12,000 and
   large nursery roosts are still being discovered. Regular observation of
   summer and winter colonies has been ongoing since the 1970's. A decline
   in the numbers of bats at northern sites was detected between the years
   1979 and 1982, and may have been related to extremely cold winters. A
   large nursery roost, believed to have been one of the largest remaining
   in western Europe, has declined to just twelve bats. A number of
   important summer and winter sites have been reroofed or grilled. The
   main threats facing this species are loss of suitable sites, by
   deterioration and disturbance, and the loss of suitable foraging
   habitats in the vicinity of the sites. Sustained monitoring, repair and
   protection of existing sites, systematic surveying for new roosts, and
   protecting suitable foraging habitats are considered as the necessary
   measures to protect Ireland's important lesser horseshoe population.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified nest site characteristics, breeding densities, and
   migratory chronology of Long-billed Curlews at Great Salt Lake, Utah. 
   The species is apparently declining in Utah, and little is know about
   their breeding ecology in the eastern Great Basin Desert.  This study
   was designed to provide wildlife biologists with baseline data useful
   for their successful management.  Curlews arrived in northern Utah in
   late March and generally departed by mid-August.  Nest densities at
   Great Salt Lake ranged from 0.64 to 2.36 males/km2.  The habitat at
   curlew nest sites consisted of significantly shorter vegetation than
   nearby random locations (xBAR = 5.7 versus 9.0 cm, respectively; P <
   .01). Nests tended to be located in small patches of vegetation near
   barren ground.  Maintenance of relatively short vegetation appears to be
   important in managing curlew habitat.  In addition, only 2 of 10 nests
   we monitored in 1992 were successful, with most lost to mammalian
   predators.  Further research is needed to determine the impact of
   mammalian predators on curlew populations.}},

Abstract = {{Growth and reproduction of the colonial hydroid Cordylophora caspia were
   monitored during the breeding season in natural conditions. In 1987, a
   life history study was carried out on the upright stems of the main
   stolen. Mean size of uprights varied cyclically. The first peak
   coincided with the peak number of sexual hydranths, after which the mean
   upright length decreased, possibly indicating somatic costs of sexual
   reproduction. Extrinsic factors like flooding may also have contributed
   to cyclical changes in upright size. In 1988 and 1989, colonies were
   reared on experimental plates in the estuary. In 1988, colonies grew
   until mid July, after which they regressed to a dormant condition and
   then started growing again in mid August. Predation and space
   competition are discussed as possible causes for this dormancy in the
   middle of the growing season. In 1989, colonies grew continually, with
   the exception of a decline in colony biomass and number of feeding
   hydranths at tile end of July, just following the peak of sexual
   reproduction. Sexual reproduction started in the early stages of
   colonial development for all years. During early summer, C. caspia
   allocated resources simultaneously in colonial growth and sexual
   reproduction. However, sexual reproduction had a clear peak in mid
   summer, and thereafter sexual reproduction ceased while colonial growth
   continued.}},
