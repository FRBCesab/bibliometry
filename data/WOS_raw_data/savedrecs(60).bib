Abstract = {{1. In order to find a more reliable basis for ecotoxicological risk
   assessment, two microcosm experiments, one in the laboratory and another
   in the held (lysimeters), were performed using pentachlorophenol (PCP)
   as a model contaminant. PCP was applied at three (0, 50 and 500 mu g
   g(-1) dry soil in the laboratory experiment) or at two (0 and 50 mu g
   g(-1) in the lysimeters) concentrations in raw humus forest soil and its
   effects on soil organisms and decomposition processes were monitored.
   Soil fauna was manipulated at two levels in the laboratory experiment:
   simple and diverse communities.
   2. PCP was strongly adsorbed onto the humus.
   3. Microbes, nematodes, enchytraeids and predatory gamasid mites were
   sensitive to PCP in the laboratory experiment.
   4. No significant faunal effects were observed on carbon and nutrient
   mineralization. At the highest PCP concentration carbon liberation
   (CO2-evolution) was lowered and NH4+-N was accumulated in the soil. PCP
   contamination indirectly affected soil pH and water content of the
   organic soil layer.
   5. In the lysimeters, after 15 weeks there were fewer enchytraeids and
   prostigmatid mites in the soil contaminated with PCP, but no changes in
   nitrogen mobilization were observed. After 49 weeks, however, there was
   less NH4+-N in the contaminated soil, while no differences in faunal
   composition were found.
   6. The results showed that, in comparison with single-species toxicity
   tests, more ecologically relevant microcosm experiments give important
   information about the behaviour of the decomposition system under
   contamination. This information, including also indirect impacts of
   chemicals, may be useful for the improvement of ecotoxicological risk
   assessment.}},

Title = {{The development of a bioindicator system for soil acidity based on
   arthropod pH preferences}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1. Changes in ecological communities may reveal information on the
   environment that is not easily obtained from abiotic sampling. This
   paper aims to develop a bioindicator system that may support the
   interpretation of acidity-related changes in soil chemistry.
   2. An experimental system was developed to test the preferences of soil
   arthropods (springtails, mites, woodlice) by their tendencies to settle
   in a gradient of soil pH from 2 to 9. The system consisted of a circular
   walkway, the bottom of which was divided into 16 compartments filled
   with purified sand; the pH of the sand was adjusted using buffer
   solutions.
   3. An extensive series of experiments was conducted to investigate the
   reproducibility of preference distributions observed for Orchesella
   cincta (Collembola) and Platynothrus peltifer (Cryptostigmata), using
   six different buffer variants and four different layouts of buffers in
   the walkway. Iso-osmolar phosphate-citrate buffers produced a response
   similar to the one observed using pH-adjusted extracts of leaf litter.
   4. Chemical analysis of the water phase in the sand/buffer system showed
   that the concentrations of K, Na, Ca, Fe and Al co-varied with pH,
   making it difficult to decide the direct chemical stimulus for arthropod
   preference behaviour.
   5. There was a great variety of responses observed among 20 arthropod
   species tested. Based on the frequency distributions observed, each
   species was assigned a median preferred pH and an `indicator value', to
   denote the specificity of the response.
   6. Many species had a broadly dispersed preference distribution, but the
   median preferred pH varied from pH 2.9 to pH 7.6. Three mites (Nothrus
   silvestris, Rhysotritia duplicata and Odontocepheus elongatus) did not
   react to pH. The collembolan Folsomia candida showed a weak and variable
   response, but avoided pH 2. Three other Collembola (Orchesella
   flavescens, O. cincta, Lepidocyrtus cyaneus) and three isopods
   (Trichoniscus pusillus, Porcellio scaber, Philoscia muscorum) preferred
   the subneutral range (median preference between pH 5.6 and pH 6.1).
   7. Species with a more or less pronounced preference for one or other
   end of the gradient were one collembolan (Tomocerus flavescens), two
   mites (Hypochthonius rufulus and Adoristes ovatus) and one isopod
   (Oniscus asellus), which were classified as acidophilous, and two
   Collembola (Isotoma notabilis, Entomobrya corticalis), two mites (Pelops
   occultus, Platynothrus peltifer) and one isopod (Armadillidium vulgare),
   which were classified as alkalophilous. The species Tomocerus minor
   showed a bimodal preference distribution.
   8. An `arthropod acidity index' is proposed which allows the median
   preferred pH of an arthropod community to be estimated from the
   indicator values, in conjunction with abundance scores in the field.
   Preliminary calculations show that the index corresponds to differences
   between forests regarding soil pH, but the absolute pH indicated is one
   unit above litter pHs.
   9. When calibrated to field data, the proposed bioindicator system may
   be used in monitoring programmes for the analysis of ecological effects
   of long-term trends in soil acidity.}},

Abstract = {{1 To investigate how CO2-enriched atmospheres may influence plant
   competition and stand size structure in regenerating forests,
   experimental populations comprised of three maternal families of yellow
   birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) were grown in both ambient (350 mu
   L L(-1)) and elevated (700 mu L L(-1)) CO2 concentrations in a
   controlled environment facility. Individual seedling growth, light
   acquisition, and stand size structure were monitored throughout the
   first year of growth.
   2 Elevated CO2 increased average seedling biomass in stands by 14\%, a
   value much lower than the average enhancement reported elsewhere for
   individually grown yellow birch seedlings. Maternal families within
   stands differed significantly in their growth responsiveness to elevated
   CO2, ranging from +51\% to -16\%. As a result, CO2 altered the genetic
   identity of dominants in regenerating stands.
   3 Seedling size inequalities were generally lower in CO2-enriched
   environments, a result that contrasts with other studies that have
   reported increased size inequality with increased productivity in
   resource-rich environments. Distribution modifying functions relating
   initial seedling size and subsequent growth suggest that there was a
   relatively smaller advantage to being larger in elevated vs. ambient CO2
   environments. Together, these results suggest that competition in
   CO2-enriched environments was less size-asymmetric.
   4 Differences in stand size structure between CO2 treatments were
   related to competition for light. Empirical measures of seedling light
   acquisition per unit biomass suggest competition for light was less
   size-asymmetric in CO2-enriched environments. Decreased size-asymmetric
   competition for light was attributable both to differences in the
   CO2-use efficiency of high-light canopy dominants vs. low-light canopy
   subordinates, and to CO2-induced differences in plant allometry.
   5 This study highlights the importance of stand-level competition
   studies in global change research, and more generally, the value of
   studies that combine phenomenological descriptions of stand development
   with physiological mechanisms of competition.}},

Abstract = {{Combinations of sticky trap monitoring toxicity test, and biochemical
   assays were conducted to study the effects of an insecticide mixture on
   an insecticide-resistant field population of the German cockroach,
   Blatella germanica (L.). Monthly treatments (6 total; month 1-6) were
   made, the 1st treatment consisted of a formulated pyrethroid insecticide
   (lambdacyhalothrin)+synergist (piperonyl butoxide)+juvenile hormone
   analog (pyriproxyfen), and the following 5 consisted of
   lambdachalothrin+pyriproxfen alone. This study was monitored for 12 mo.
   We found reductions in sticky trap catches (from 27.9 to 2.6 cockroaches
   trapped per apartment at the beginning and end of the study,
   respectively); increases in the percentage of trapped adults having
   twisted wings (an indicator of juvenile hormone analog-induced
   sterility); and reduced ratios of nymphs:adults and gravid:nongravid
   females. For F-1 offspring of cockroaches live-trapped before
   insecticide treatments, topical toxicity tests revealed the
   following:resistance to the active ingredient used on the population for
   8 previous years (cypermethrin; LD(50) resistance ratio {[}RR]=82.2), a
   reduction in cypermethrin resistance following pretreatment with
   piperonyl butoxide (90.2\% at LD(50)), and cross-resistance to
   chlorpyrifos (LD(50) RR=5.22). In surface-contact (jar) tests,
   significant tolerance was also found to cypermethrin (LT(50) RR=7.3),
   chlorpyrifos (LT(50) RR=1.2), and lambdacyhalothrin (LT(50) RR=1.5). In
   F-1 offspring of cockroaches collected from the field after an 80.0\%
   reduction in trap catch, jar tests with lambdacyhalothrin indicated
   increased tolerance over the original population (25.0\% at LT(50)).
   Similarly, biochemical assays of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes
   indicated increases in 1-naphthyl acetate and 2-naphthyl acetate
   hydrolysis, and in total cytochrome P450 content, but not change in
   p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis. We discuss results in terms of the
   effects of this strategy on resistance levels, suspected resistance
   mechanisms, and the further development of resistance management
   strategies.}},

   to adult Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Perring. Initial surveys of B.
   argentifolii susceptibility to the test insecticides established a basis
   for monitoring possible changes in population sensitivity to these
   products. Data on tolerance of B. argentifolii adult populations were
   obtained in 1992 (20 populations) and 1993 (22 populations) with treated
   glass vials. Surveys on populations from different host crops (cotton,
   cole crops, and melons) were done in different geographical areas in
   Arizona. Probit analysis of the results indicated that the LC(50)s from
   many of the test sites were significantly different, exhibiting various
   levels of tolerance to the insecticides tested. Host plants, crop
   phenology, and the geographical region seemed to affect responses of B.

Abstract = {{Eighteen field populations of Plutella xl/lostella (L.) from Central
   America were tested for susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp.
   kurstaki Berliner, and 7 of the 18 field populations were tested for
   susceptibility to B. thuringiensis subsp. aizawai. Tests with B.
   thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki were done with a leaf-dip bioassay and a
   single concentration (20.5 mg {[}Al]/liter) incorporated in diet. Only
   leaf-dip bioassays were used in tests with B. thuringiensis subsp.
   aizawai. The LC(50)s of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki in the field
   populations from Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica ranged from 4.3- to
   18.3-, 9.3- to 77.2-, and 13.3- to 19.5-fold higher, respectively, than
   the LC(50) of a susceptible population from New York (Geneva 88).
   LC(50)s of B. thuringiensis subsp. aizawai in the 7 field populations
   were 1.9- to 3.3-fold higher than the LC(50) of Geneva 88. Mortality in
   the single concentration test varied significantly among populations
   within countries, and 14 field populations displayed significantly lower
   mortality than Geneva 88. Results from both bioassay techniques suggest
   that populations of P. xylostella from Central America have evolved
   resistance to B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki. Monitoring populations
   of P. xylostella for baseline and changing levels of susceptibility to
   B. thuringiensis subspecies and the implementation of pesticide
   resistance management strategies are urgently needed in Central America.}},

Abstract = {{Seven Plutella xylostella (L.) populations were compared for resistance
   to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki Berliner in leaf-dip and
   diet-incorporated bioassays. The persistence of the microbial
   insecticide incorporated in diet was studied at 2 storage temperatures
   (26.7 and 5 degrees C). The effect of larval age on toxicity of a
   discriminating concentration of Javelin incorporated in diet (20.5 mg
   {[}Al]/liter) was also studied. in the leaf-dip bioassay, LC(50)S of 6
   field populations were 2.6- to approximate to 829-fold higher than the
   LC(50) of Geneva 88, the susceptible population, whereas LC(50)s in the
   diet-incorporated bioassay-were 1.7- to approximate to 42-fold higher in
   the field populations compared with the LC(50) Of Geneva 88. Despite the
   difference in resistance ratios between bioassay methods, LC(50)S were
   significantly correlated. Both methods were effective in distinguishing
   between susceptible and resistant populations. With 1 exception, slopes
   of the regressions in individual populations were not significantly
   different. We concluded that both bioassay techniques were suitable for
   monitoring evolution of resistance to B. thuringiensis in field
   populations of P. xylostella. Compared with diet prepared the day of the
   tests, the toxicity of B. thuringiensis did not vary significantly in
   diet stored for 10 d at 26.7 degrees C, and the LC(50)s of Javelin did
   not vary significantly in diet stored for 14 d at 5 degrees C. Mortality
   of 2nd and 3rd inslars was not significantly different when exposed to a
   discriminating concentration of Javelin incorporated in diet, but
   mortality was significantly lower in 4th instars. The diet-incorporated
   B. thuringiensis assay can be used as a resistance test kit for
   resistance studies.}},

Abstract = {{Mating disruption of Mexican rice borers, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), by
   synthetic pheromone applications in sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) was
   investigated in large-scale field studies. Mating disruption was
   assessed using pheromone trapping, mating tables, stalk dissections, and
   nocturnal collections of adults. Pheromone traps were inappropriate for
   monitoring mating disruption. Mating tables supplied useful information
   but overestimated effects of pheromone applications on mating activities
   of feral rice borer populations. Adult collections and dissections
   supplied the least ambiguous assessment of mating activities, but were
   interpreted most easily in the presence of other substantiating data.
   Pheromone applications formulated in rubber ships or microporous beads
   and applied in a polybutene-based adhesive did not result in appreciable
   levels of mating disruption, and did not control rice borer populations
   or reduce associated stalk injury levels.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of feeding rhythms in post-smelt Atlantic salmon Salmo
   salar have produced variable results. Therefore, the present study was
   performed to clarify the source of these differences and to examine
   size-related variation in daily feeding patterns. A small group of
   hatchery reared post-smelts was kept in an indoor seawater tank under
   conditions of constant photoperiod and light intensity, and negligible
   diurnal variation in water temperature. Feeding responses were monitored
   by video camera throughout the day. The resultant feeding pattern for
   the population mirrored an earlier study, with the highest levels of
   feeding activity in the early morning and late evening. Differences
   between this and other studies may be due to variation in climate.
   season or life-history stage. Daily feeding patterns were
   size-dependent. The largest fish fed al a relatively constant level
   through the day, medium-sized fish fed in a pattern similar to that
   described above for the population and small fish fed most al first and
   last light. These differences were due probably to the effect of
   competitive interactions upon fish of different sizes. (C) 1997 The

Abstract = {{Biologists of the California Department of Fish and Game have conducted
   quarterly spotlight surveys of San Joaquin kit foxes, Vulpes macrotis
   mutica, and potential species of prey along seven 48-km routes since
   1970. The annual reproductive cycle of the foxes was reflected by a
   seasonal cycle in the counts. Counts of foxes during surveys in June
   were correlated with total precipitation during the previous rainfall
   season, but not with concurrent counts of prey. Number of foxes
   seen/0.8-km interval was more highly correlated with estimated sighting
   distance based on physical features, such as hills and plains, than with
   current vegetation density or type. Mean number of foxes counted per
   survey per route ranged from two to 20. Counts of foxes increased over
   time on one route, decreased over time on another, and showed a
   curvilinear trend on two routes. The average number of foxes seen over
   all routes did not show any long-term trend. However, small samples,
   missing data, and lack of replication limited statistical analysis and
   interpretation of surveys. Statistical tests on simulated data similar
   to the data collected during the surveys indicated that larger samples,
   which could be obtained by replication, would be needed to detect
   changes in the population of foxes with any efficiency (statistical
   power). An expanded spotlight-survey program of kit foxes, with
   additional routes and replicated surveys, could be used to monitor
   population trends throughout the range of this endangered subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we examined how habitat and tidal stage influence
   predation upon molting blue crabs Callinectes sapidus. On 3 separate
   occasions we monitored the survival of tethered soft crabs in each of 2
   different-sized marsh creeks and 2 seagrass sites, during both low and
   high tides. On one of these occasions, we also tethered hard crabs.
   Survival was much lower for soft crabs than for hard crabs, indicating
   that crabs may be particularly vulnerable when they molt. In both
   seagrass and marsh creeks, there was a tidal influence upon soft crab
   survival, with greater survival during low tides. There was no
   generalized difference in survival of soft crabs between habitats, i.e.
   marsh creek versus grassbed. Survival was high in the small marsh creek,
   but lower in the large marsh creek. In both creeks survival remained
   relatively constant throughout the summer. In contrast, survival did not
   differ between the 2 seagrass sites and was comparable to that in the
   small marsh creek early in the summer, but decreased to levels
   comparable to the large marsh creek by summers end. In the marsh creek,
   micro-habitat also influenced survival, with greater survival along the
   creek edge micro-habitats than in the creek centers. Cannibalism was the
   only identifiable source of mortality among tethered crabs. These
   results demonstrate that where and when a crab molts may greatly
   influence its chances for survival.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of blubber and morphometric data were obtained in 1991 from a
   population of ringed seals (Phoca hispida) located in southeastern
   Hudson Bay, near the Belcher Islands, Several PCB congeners, DDT and its
   metabolites, components of technical chlordane, HCH compounds, dieldrin
   and mirex were detected at concentrations below 150 ng/g lipid in the
   blubber of these animals. Female seals had lower concentrations of PCB
   congeners, DDT compounds and chlordane compounds in the blubber than
   male seals from this region, but there were no sex-specific differences
   observed for HCH compounds, dieldrin and mirex. Correlations were
   observed between the age of male seals and their Estimated `blubber
   burdens' (mg) of total PCBs and total DDT. There was evidence that the
   male seals front the Belcher Islands had higher concentrations and
   blubber burdens of total PCBs and lower concentrations of total HCHs
   than male seals sampled in 1989 from a population at Holman Island in
   the northwest Canadian arctic. Morphometric data indicated that the
   Holman Island seals were in better condition than the Belcher Islands
   seals at the time of sampling. Dine to the negative correlation observed
   between contaminant concentrations in ringed seals and the condition of
   the animals, analysis of blubber burdens in seals may be a preferable
   method for monitoring spatial and temporal trends in the contamination
   of ringed seals in the arctic. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Monoconidial isolates of the pecan scab fungus, Cladosporium caryigenum,
   were obtained in 1993 and 1994 from one pecan orchard each in jeff Davis
   and Troup counties in Georgia, counties with no previous history of
   exposure to demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicides. Isolates were
   grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with propiconazole or
   fenbuconazole at 0, 0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5,
   1.0, or 5.0 mu g ml(-1). After 4 to 5 weeks at 25 degrees C, the
   diameter of each colony was measured. Relative growth was expressed as
   the colony diameter for each fungicide concentration as a percentage of
   the diameter on unamended PDA. ED50 values for both fungicides in all
   years and locations were lognormally distributed. Mean ED50 values
   ranged from 0.19 to 0.30 mu g ml(-1) for fenbuconazole and 0.12 to 0.17
   mu g ml(-1) for propiconazole. There were highly significant positive
   correlations between sensitivity to propiconazole and sensitivity to
   fenbuconazole at all locations and years, indicating significant
   potential for development of cross-resistance to these compounds. A
   discriminatory concentration of 0.2 mu g ml(-1) propiconazole was
   selected for further monitoring of DMI sensitivity. With this
   discriminatory concentration, a sample size of 50 isolates was estimated
   to be sufficient to detect a difference of 8.3\% in mean relative growth
   between two populations.}},

Abstract = {{Brown stem rot frequently is more severe in no-till cropping systems.
   Population density of Phialophora gregata was monitored in soybean
   residue positioned below and on the soil surface. Current season residue
   was confined in nylon mesh bags that were placed in the field in the
   fall. Population density of the pathogen was measured monthly through
   the winter, or seasonally for 30 months, and expressed as CFU per gram
   of soybean residue. Population dynamics of P. gregata differed in
   surface residue, compared with buried residue. Population density of I!
   gregata was not significantly different in buried and surface residue
   from November/December to April. Beginning in late April or May,
   population density of P. gregata was significantly greater in surface
   residue than in buried residue. The population density of P. gregata in
   surface residue remained above 10(5) CFU per gram of residue after 30
   months in the field. In contrast, the fungus was not detected in buried
   residue after 11 to 17 months. From November to May, the population
   destiny of P. gregata in surface residue increased more than 14 times
   the initial density. In contrast, the density of P. gregata in buried
   residue increased sixfold by April, then decreased to densities not
   significantly different from the initial population by May and June.
   Mass of buried residue decreased more rapidly than that of surface
   residue during April, May, and June. There was a positive correlation
   between residue weight and the population density of P. gregata in
   residue. P. gregata survived longer and at higher population densities
   in residue positioned on the soil surface (simulated no-till) than in
   buried residue (simulated conventional tillage). Although inoculum
   density of P. gregata remained high in surface residue, total inoculum
   declined because of loss of residue biomass.}},

Abstract = {{In a study of transfer of Chernobyl radiocaesium to man, dietary surveys
   and whole body monitoring were conducted at two sites in the Bryansk
   Region of the Russian Federation. Radiocaesium activity concentrations
   in wild food products, especially mushrooms, were higher than those in
   agricultural products. The surveys revealed that consumption of highly
   contaminated wild mushrooms provided a significant contribution to
   ingested radiocaesium, accounting for 20-40\% of the variability of
   radiocaesium activity concentrations in rural populations 8-9 years
   after the 1986 accident. Consumption of mushrooms was also the main
   reason for a 60-70\% mean increase in radiocaesium activity
   concentrations in humans in autumn. Long term dose assessments after
   accidental releases of radiocaesium should therefore consider the
   potential contribution by mushrooms to ingested dose. Copyright (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The provision of a refuge from fish predation for large-bodied Cladocera
   among stands of submerged macrophytes is thought to be an important
   stabilising mechanism against nutrient-induced phytoplankton increases
   in clear water shallow lakes. The occurrence of any refuge effect in
   relation to the seasonal impact of both macrophyte development and
   recruitment of zooplanktivorous fish was monitored over the summer
   months (May to September) in three lakes (Cromes Broad, Hoveton Little
   Broad/Pound End, and Upton Broad) of variable trophic status, fish
   community structure and nature and extent of macrophyte cover, in the
   Norfolk Broads in Eastern England. At all sites, Daphnia spp. exhibited
   a early summer peak of abundance but had declined rapidly by July
   probably as a result of predation from underyearling fish. In extensive
   macrophyte stands (Cromes Broad) Daphnia spp. persisted after its
   elimination in open water, indicating some refuge effect. At sites with
   macrophyte cover and/or low fish predation pressure, Daphnia spp. was
   replaced by Ceriodaphnia spp., both with and without Simocephalus sp.,
   thus maintaining large populations of grazing Cladocera, apparently
   capable of exerting a high grazing pressure on phytoplankton. This
   occurred, even under high predation pressure from a relatively high
   density of zooplanktivorous 0+ fish (Cromes Broad), consistent with the
   refuge hypothesis. In addition, at this site, significant positive
   associations of cladoceran abundance with increasing macrophyte cover
   were apparent throughout the summer. From information on the
   distribution of fish it is suggested that dense macrophytes offer the
   most suitable refuge through provision of predator-free space.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by herbivorous birds is often cited as an important factor in
   suppressing macrophyte development in shallow lakes undergoing
   restoration, thus delaying the attainment of the stable clear water
   state. Development and succession of macrophyte communities and size,
   diet and grazing pressure of coot (Fulica atra) populations upon
   macrophytes, were monitored over the seasonal cycle at ten shallow lakes
   of varying nutrient status, in the Norfolk Broads in eastern England. In
   spring, territorial breeding birds were at relatively low density and
   included only a small proportion of macrophytes in their diet, resulting
   in low grazing pressure on macrophytes. In summer, there was a
   significant relationship between macrophyte cover and bird density,
   illustrating the importance of macrophytes in the dispersion phase for
   birds following breeding. Macrophytes comprised the bulk of bird diet
   where they were available and the consumption of macrophytes was up to
   76 fold higher than in spring. However, losses to grazing in both
   periods were negligible when compared to potential growth rates
   documented in the literature. Grazing experiments at two biomanipulated
   lakes confirmed that birds were not responsible for limiting macrophytes
   during the spring colonisation phase or in the summer growth period.
   During the period of autumnal senescence and over the winter months
   where some macrophyte species remain available, e.g. as developed
   individuals or dormant buds, grazing by birds may conceivably have an
   impact on the development and structure of macrophyte populations in
   subsequent growing seasons.
   The relative importance of bird grazing compared to other factors
   limiting the development of macrophytes in shallow lakes is discussed in
   the light of other experimental studies.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which natural populations of teleost fish resist
   infection in spite of the wide variety of microorganisms in their
   environment are poorly understood. To begin evaluating the relevance of
   an intact immune system to natural populations of a marine teleost, we
   monitored age and seasonal patterns of serum antibody responses of feral
   red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus, (Linnaeus)) against bacteria indigenous
   to their brackish water environment. Among the three populations which
   were most extensively studied, the percentage of red drum within a
   natural population which exhibited serum antibody responses against
   indigenous bacteria increased with the age of the animals. In red drum
   from two of the three sites, antibody responses were highest in seasons
   where water temperatures were highest, but this pattern was difficult to
   separate from age-related effects. When anti-bacterial responses were
   compared among all five study populations, striking differences were
   noted. These differences did not appear to correlate with the age or
   general health of the animals, water temperatures, or the bacteria
   densities of surface waters and adherent to fish scales. Two locations,
   Winyah Bay and Plum Island, which had the lowest percentage of
   non-responsive red drum, also had the greatest load of sediment
   contaminants, suggesting that low anti-bacterial responses may correlate
   with the level of anthropogenic stress. Future studies are being
   designed to assess whether the lack of anti-bacterial antibodies, as
   measured in this assay, also correlates with decreased antibody
   responses against indigenous fish pathogens and with an increased
   susceptibility to opportunistic infection.}},

Abstract = {{Forests in urban areas are an important component of urban and suburban
   environments. They provide places for recreation and environmental
   education, wildlife habitat for species adapted to living near humans,
   contribute to general human physical and psychological health. Knowing
   how much and what type of forest exists in urban areas provides critical
   baseline data for evaluating changes in that resource, and critical data
   to access factors that influence forest management and health. Forest
   Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data combined with population estimates
   constitute two valuable sources of information that show promise in
   understanding the extent, structure, and location of the forest resource
   in urban areas of the central hardwood region. Ownership information was
   examined to assess whether size and/or type of ownership is related to
   population density. There is increasing parcelization of forested lands
   and an increase in the numbers of nonindustrial private forest-land
   owners. Identifying where this parcelization is taking place in relation
   to population centers is important in understanding the process of
   fragmentation of forest land. The use of these techniques offer an
   opportunity to monitor changes in this important resource.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous locations throughout the paper mill are suitable for the growth
   of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. The growth of
   facultative anaerobes may be of particular importance in these systems
   due to alternating aerobic and anaerobic conditions found in many paper
   systems. Bacterial growth under anaerobic conditions causes specific
   problems not associated with bacterial growth under aerobic conditions.
   Anaerobic bacteria produce H-2, H2S and volatile fatty acids as part of
   their metabolism. Along with the health and safety issues related to
   toxic and explosive gas production, the volatile fatty acids generated
   cause significant odor problems in both the mill and the products being
   produced. Anaerobic bacterial growth is not new to the paper mill;
   however, in recent years problems related to growth of anaerobes has
   become more prevalent. The major contributor to increased anaerobic
   growth is likely closure of mill water systems. In addition, the methods
   of culturing anaerobic bacteria have become more sophisticated in recent
   years, allowing for better growth and recovery of anaerobic organisms
   from paper systems. Controlling the anaerobic bacterial population in
   the mill environment can be difficult. Considering that biocides often
   target certain bacterial enzyme systems involved in cellular metabolism,
   the response of anaerobic bacteria to biocides may be different from
   their aerobic counterparts, which are generally the population being
   monitored. With an increase in the number of problems related to
   anaerobic bacteria, a better understanding of the role of these
   organisms is needed. This paper will deal with issues related to growth,
   monitoring and control of anaerobic bacteria in the papermaking process.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the Pembrokeshire coast and islands, together with its inshore
   waters, are of international importance for their breeding seabirds and
   wintering seaduck. Although the Sea Empress oil spill occurred before
   the breeding season, some 7000 oiled birds were recovered dead or alive.
   The impact of the oil spill on birds can be classified as follows:
   immediate mortality especially of more than 4500 wintering common scoter
   in Carmarthen Bay; sublethal effects on productivity of colonies and
   reduced adult survival from oil or dispersant ingestion; and chronic
   effects on bird populations from long-term pollution, particularly of
   prey. A range of monitoring and research projects are under way to
   investigate the impact, but it is premature to provide many results. The
   oil spill probably caused significant local declines in seabird colony
   sizes, especially of guillemot. The impact on common scorer will prove
   difficult to determine because of the poor quality and high variability
   of preincident data. Large numbers of oiled birds, particularly common
   scoter,, were treated and subsequently released. The successful
   rehabilitation of such released birds is controversial; research and
   review, results will be reported.}},

Abstract = {{Acidic deposition has a great impact on water chemistry and fish
   populations in the Adirondack region. Although the Clean Air Act
   Amendments of 1990 have resulted in some reductions of sulfate
   deposition, nitrate deposition has not yet been well controlled, and
   continues to impact aquatic resources. As part of the USEPA funded
   Episodic Response Project four Adirondack headwater streams were
   intensively monitored over an Is month period. Atmospheric deposition
   was also monitored at a centrally located station. The quantity of
   nitrate being deposited on the study watersheds was calculated based on
   monthly net deposition data which ranged from 0.6 kg/ha/month to 3.6
   kg/ha/month. These data were then compared to the monthly export of
   nitrate from the watershed in these streams. Nitrate concentrations were
   highest in the streamwater during the spring snowmelt period prior to
   the time when forest vegetation actively utilizes nitrate. On an annual
   basis the amount of nitrate which left the watershed via stream water
   exceeded the amount which fell as nitrate deposition. These data are
   important in documenting the impact of nitrate in the acidification of
   Adirondack streams during the spring, which coincides with brook trout

Abstract = {{Leaf demography and water relations of the drought semi-deciduous East
   Mediterranean shrub Phlomis fruticosa L. were seasonally monitored
   during a 28 month period. Naturally growing individuals at low (c.a. 40
   m) and high (c.a. 600 m) elevation, exposed to full sunlight or shaded
   by the canopy of evergreen sclerophylls were used. At the exposed, low
   elevation site, photosynthetic rates were also monitored, both daily and
   annually. It was found that
   a) Based on the time of their burst, two kinds of leaves can be
   distinguished; long lived, spring leaves, with arrested growth and small
   size during the dry summer period, but resumed growth after the autumn
   rains, attaining a life-span of about 13 months; and winter leaves,
   bursting in late autumn/early winter, whose life-span depended on the
   extent of summer drought. Severely dehydrated, exposed shrubs shed their
   winter leaves in early summer. Shaded shrubs, however, maintained
   satisfactory water contents and kept their winter leaves up to late
   summer.
   b) Leaf sizes and the percentage contribution of the two leaf types on
   total leaf population and area depended on season and experimental site.
   c) Analysis of the above demographic information in relation to the
   climatic data at the experimental sites and the leaf water content,
   indicates that water shortage during the summer and low temperature
   during the winter determine the phenology and limit the growth of leaves
   in P. fruticosa.
   d) Daily measurements of net Photosynthetic rates taken at nearly
   monthly intervals were used to assess the relative contribution of the
   two leaf types on total yearly CO2 assimilation by the shrubs in the
   exposed, low elevation site. Although photosynthetic rates of winter
   leaves were higher compared to spring leaves during their winter and
   spring co-occurrence on the same shrubs, their yearly based relative
   contribution was greatly exceeded by that of spring leaves, when the
   corresponding leaf duration was considered. These results cast doubt on
   the general conviction that the small spring leaves contribute
   negligibly to the productivity of drought semi-deciduous Mediterranean
   shrubs.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores are both important in mesotrophic
   grasslands and these two different classes of herbivore potentially
   interact in their effect upon plant populations. We used two field
   experiments to test for higher order interactions (HOIs) among sheep,
   slugs and seedlings, using the mechanistic definition that an HOI occurs
   when the presence of one species modifies the interaction between two
   others. In each experiment slug addition and slug-removal treatments
   were nested inside treatments that altered sheep,orating intensity and
   timing, and the emergence of seedlings from experimentally sown seeds
   was monitored. In Experiment 1, seedling numbers of Cerastium fontanum
   were increased by intense summer grazing by sheep in both slug-addition
   and slug removal treatments, but winter grazing by sheep only increased
   seedling emergence if slugs were removed. In Experiment 2, winter
   grazing by sheep significantly reduced total seedling emergence of four
   species sown (Lotus corniculatus, Plantago lanceolata, Leucanthemum
   vulgare, Achillea millefolium), but the effect was only seen where slugs
   were removed. Though the experimental system is a relatively simple one
   with only four components (sheep: slugs, seedlings and the matrix
   vegetation), higher order interactions, a combination of direct and
   indirect effects and possible switching behaviour by slugs are all
   suggested by our results.}},

Abstract = {{We examined immigration in populations of Peromyscus leucopus
   (white-footed mice) by 1) monitoring natural immigration at 10 sites, 2)
   introducing experimental immigrants into eight populations, and 3)
   constructing qualitative models of immigration. Density of natural
   immigrants covaried positively with resident density, and successful
   assimilation was lower at low resident and immigrant densities. Females
   and males did not differ in their chance of achieving residency. Year,
   sex, and cumber introduced were significant predictors of assimilation
   by individuals. Experimentally introduced individuals had no effect on
   densities of those mice resident before the introductions. Results
   obtained from studying natural immigration differed from those obtained
   from studying experimental immigration. Signed digraphs and time
   averaging were used to model the consequences of different
   resident-immigrant relationships and to suggest how different sources of
   variation may have affected assimilation and led to differences in
   natural and experimental immigration. Resident and immigrant densities
   could have been positively correlated even if residents actively
   inhibited immigration. Variation in immigrant density and survival
   rather than resident territorial activity apparently determined patterns
   of assimilation.}},

Abstract = {{We examined temporal variation in developmental stability measured by
   fluctuating asymmetry of 10 skull characters in sympatric populations of
   three shrew species: Sorer araneus Linnaeus, 1758, S. caecutiens
   Laxmann, 1788 and S. tundrensis Merriam, 1900 from one locality in
   central Siberia with a high four-year-cycle of small mammals.
   Simultaneous significant changes in developmental stability have been
   revealed during a population cycle 1986-1989 for all three, most
   abundant shrew species in the locality. The highest asymmetry for all
   these species occurred in the year of maximal density. Similar high
   asymmetry was found for the separate samples of two other species: S.
   roboratus Hollister, 1913 and S. isodon Turov, 1924, collected in a peak
   year 1989 only. The maximal density in 1989 corresponded to the lowest
   level of breeding success and developmental stability and, vice versa,
   minimal density in 1986 was accompanied by the highest level of breeding
   success and developmental stability. These data suggest that
   overpopulation caused by high density of various small mammals adversely
   affects an organism's condition. Thus, developmental stability may be
   used to monitor possible changes in a population even in cases where

Pages = {{79-85}},
Abstract = {{We compared developmental stability and total phenotypic diversity of 25
   skull characters in three populations of European bison Bison bonasus
   (Linnaeus, 1758). Developmental stability was measured by fluctuating
   asymmetry, which was estimated by the variance of the left-right (l-r)
   and scaled (l-r)/(l+r) differences between the left (l) and right (r)
   sides of the skull. Mean number of asymmetrical characters per
   individual was used as an integrated index of developmental stability.
   Total phenotypic variability was examined by variance of (l+r) for the
   same characters. Greater developmental instability and total phenotypic
   diversity were found in bison from Pszczyna Reserve and Bialowieza
   Primeval Forest, as compared with those from Okskii Reserve. This
   indicates the gradual deterioration of developmental stability in the
   following sequence of the studied populations: Okskii Reserve,
   Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Pszczyna Reserve. In the Bialowieza
   population, deterioration of developmental stability could be detected,
   even though commonly used fitness measures showed no response. In the
   Pszczyna population, more serious developmental stability disturbance
   was accompanied by decreased viability, an expression of inbreeding
   depression. Two samples taken from the Bialowieza population at
   different times showed similar levels of developmental stability, which
   indicates the reliability of fluctuating asymmetry. These results
   suggest developmental stability to be an essential characteristic for
   monitoring populations and especially for revealing the initial response
   to stress.}},

   predator activity resulted in a reduction in the amount of time adults
   spent away (>1m) from the brood. Plasma cortisol levels measured in fish
   exposed to different lengths of capture time showed no difference in
   fish hunted for up to 25 minutes before capture, but levels were highly
   variable, (0.6-38 ng.ml(-1) in naive fish). Transfer of fish to the

   pollutants, collected in the urban area of pome. Data have been measured
   during 1993 at fixed site stations of the PMP (Presidio Multizonale di

   The Weibull distribution is taken into consideration to reproduce the
   experimental data distributions.
   We deal with two aspects: with regard to the first we discuss about the
   opportunity to introduce a new ``indicator{''} for concentration level
   evaluated from the Weibull distribution and linked to air quality
   threshold. This parameter is related to the ``difference{''} between
   mean and mode of the Weibull distribution. It appears that the knowledge
   of the mean concentration could not be enough to give information about
   the exposure levels for the population.
   With the regard to the second aspect the study shows that the
   adimensional parameter of the Weibull distribution could be related to
   typologies of emissions and to distributions of atmospheric turbolence.}},

Abstract = {{International Programme on chemical Safety (IPCS) introduced the
   environmental health criteria for beryllium (1990). General human
   population exposure today is mainly confirmed to low levels airborne
   beryllium from combustion of fossil fuels. Where coal of very high
   beryllium content is burned heath problems may arise.
   In industrial urban agglomerations, Wroclaw being one of them technical
   monitoring of beryllium should be complemented with biological
   monitoring (I). We propose bioindicators trees able to accumulate
   beryllium abilities: Populus nigra, Corylus columa and Tilia cordata.
   Concentration of Be measured by Atomic Absorption Spectophotometry was
   determined in leaves and in dust deposited on leaves collected from
   sampling sites with different degree of air pollution.
   Czaja Mnium test revealed that the dust deposited in all sampling sites
   was toxic to experimental plants Moreover, leave showed disturbances in
   cationic equilibrium ie. their Olsen's constant was below 12,51,
   Beryllium concentration in leaves of the above species and probably also
   of other species is a good bioindicator of air pollution, with this
   element produced mostly by imission of dust from power stations.
   Concentration of beryllium in leaves is correlated with the
   concentration of sulphur and to a high degree reflects also
   concentration of SO2 in atmosphere This indicates a possibility to me
   the level of beryllium in tree leaves to evaluate pollution with this
   metal on a local scale, its spatial distribution in big cities and to
   detect the extent of dust imissions from main sources e. g. big power
   station.}},

Abstract = {{The air quality of Seoul, the capital city of Korea, has been steadily
   growing worse for the past few decades. With a population of over 11
   million and cars numbering more than 2.1 million the photochemical smog
   problem in this megacity of Seoul is starting to reach disturbing
   levels. In order to comply with the public's increasing demands for
   cleaner air the government started the ozone alarm system in July of
   1995 and is planning to initiate an ozone forecasting system in 1997.
   But what is the best indicator of ozone concentration that is most
   harmful to the public and urban ecosystem of Seoul? Other countries are
   also struggling with this question and air quality indicators such as
   annual l-hr maximum concentration, annual 8-hr maximum, number of times
   exceeding 120 ppb, and others including cumulative exposure indices are
   being studied as possible candidates for regulatory standards.
   Therefore, in this study, we look at the various air quality indicators
   of ozone concentration, their values relative to other big cities and
   the relationship among the indicators themselves for Seoul. The
   potential impact of these air quality indicators on regulatory problems
   are also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Moose have been subject to major hunting pressure since the start of the
   settlement period. By the end of the last century, moose were considered
   on the verge of extinction throughout eastern North America. In Quebec,
   the control of moose harvesting began in 1843 with the introduction of a
   no hunting period (February 1 - August 1). Gradually, regulations became
   stricter, finally resulting in imposing the bulls-only law in 1899. In
   1955, harvest monitoring began with the systematic survey of the harvest
   and the number of licences sold. The first population estimates, based
   on the observations of forest workers and trappers, also date back to
   this period. However, it was only during the seventies that systematic
   population monitoring and survey methods were adopted, the latter
   becoming necessary due to increased sport hunting pressure. Currently,
   monitoring of moose is based on three main tools: registration of the
   harvest, aerial surveys of the populations and socioeconomic surveys of
   the hunters. Moose hunting increased noticeably over the last 25 years.
   The number of moose hunters grew from about 15,000 in the early sixties
   to over 155,000 by 1991. This important growth is the result of an
   increase in the potential clientele (baby-boomers) whose interest was
   stimulated by several regulatory or social measures. However, the sport
   harvest of moose has not followed the same growth pattern. In the early
   sixties, approximately 2,500 moose were harvested; this figure climbed
   to approximately 12,000 in the early eighties followed by a 1 \%
   decrease per year, despite an increase in the number of hunters, the
   development of bow hunting and the increase in the harvest in wildlife
   reserves. Meanwhile, hunting success has gradually declined, falling
   from a peak of 20 \% (bulls only) to less than 7.5 \% (bulls, cows and
   calves) in recent years. All of the indicators tend to show that the
   harvest rate exceeded the optimum level in the early eighties. Aerial
   surveys conducted at the end of the eighties suggest that the harvest
   rate exceeded the capacity of the moose population in most hunting
   zones. Only the populations of those zones where only bow hunting was
   allowed, and possibly a few northern zones where access is difficult,
   seemed to be growing. In the early nineties, the post-hunting population
   was estimated at 52,543 moose outside wildlife reserves, and about
   13,000 moose in the reserves. Outside wildlife reserves, densities are
   low (approximate to 1 moose/10 km(2)) everywhere, except in western
   Quebec and in zones where only bow hunting is authorized. The harvest
   rates associated with hunting are high (19 - 44 \%) in all zones
   offering easy access. The proportion of bulls is very low (25 - 39 \%)
   among adults in ail the hunting zones except in the northern ones (19
   and 22: 47 - 48 \%). A Management plan, focusing on the protection of
   cows, was introduced in 1994. The aim of this plan is to increase the
   population by 13 to 15 \% by the fall of 1998. In 1994, the Plan made it
   possible to diminish cow harvest by approximately 3,000 individuals.}},

   management system existed across northeast Asia. Biological data were
   collected regularly and used to formulate scientifically based
   recommendations for regulating the sport and game harvest of moose.
   Populations were stable and at reasonably high densities and sex and age
   structure was balanced. Since 1985, the situation for large ungulates
   and their predators has worsened sharply. The monitoring system has
   broken down and management of moose has been assumed by local
   authorities. Spontaneous and uncontrolled hunting, unreasonably high
   harvest quotas, and an influx of wealthy foreign hunters have
   contributed to decreased densities, imbalanced sex ratios, and lowered
   productivity throughout much of the area. Beginning in 1994 in the
   Chukotka, hunting of moose was severely restricted in an effort to
   rehabilitate populations.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the potential of infrared aerial surveys to monitor moose
   populations in northern New Hampshire during January 1995. Surveys were
   conducted at 2 sites: near Pittsburg, an area with high moose density
   (>0.8 moose/km(2)) and Milan, a region with moderate moose density (<0.8
   moose/km(2)). Both sites contained extensive deciduous and mixed-wood
   forests and were known moose wintering areas. The surveys were conducted
   by Airscan Inc. using a Cessna 337G that employed a Westinghouse WesCam
   DS 10X infrared sensor.
   Three surveys were conducted at each study site. Surveys I and II were
   designed to determine the sightability of moose in different cover-types
   and terrains by surveying 500 hectare subsites under different search
   intensities in a deciduous and a mixed-wood cover-type, respectively.
   Analysis of variance was used to determine the influence of terrain,
   elevation, cover type, and population density on sightability. A
   sightability correction factor was derived to produce a corrected moose
   density from the initial search data. Survey III, an intense search of
   the entire site, was used to compare with the corrected results of
   Surveys I and II.
   Moose were observed in a variety of cover-types, terrains, elevations,
   and at moderate to high population densities. Search effort averaged 1.0
   min/km(2) during initial searches. The overall sightability was 88\% for
   both sites combined and was influenced by terrain and elevation. The
   moose densities corrected for sightability at Pittsburg (1.6
   moose/km(2)) and Milan (0.7 moose/km(2)) were similar (+/-6\%) to those
   from Survey III. Infrared surveys were cost effective relative to
   traditional aerial surveys, had greater survey area, and were applicable
   at least in moderate to high population density areas. This study
   indicated that this technique can monitor population fluctuations and
   provide reasonable population estimates of moose in northern New
   Hampshire.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic technology entails the insertion of foreign genetic material
   into the germ line. Common procedures for accomplishing such gene
   transfer include pronuclear microinjection of purified DNA, infection of
   early embryos with recombinant retroviruses, and insertion of DNA into
   embryonic stem (ES) cells. The first developed and most commonly used
   technique is microinjection. This procedure is fast and applicable to a
   wide variety of species. Recombinant retroviruses are rarely used,
   though they have the advantage that single DNA molecules are integrated
   with minimal disruption of host cell DNA. ES cell technology is very
   powerful, because selection can be used on the cells grown in vitro,
   such that genes can be replaced by homologous recombination. This
   approach is technically demanding and currently readily applicable only
   to mice. Transgenic animals have the potential for dramatically reducing
   animals use. Genes can be inserted which serve as monitors of mutagen
   exposure, such that mutations can be identified in the absence of
   phenotypic change. Mice can be modified so as to be susceptible to viral
   infections usually limited to primates, so testing of vaccines such as
   the polio vaccine can be adapted to rodents. Disease models can be
   created with foreknowledge of the specific genetic change underlying the
   disease state. This advance has the potential of reducing the screening
   of animals for spontaneous mutations that mimic human disease, and the
   experiments required to characterize such spontaneous mutations. While
   it is theoretically possible that transgenic animals pose the risk of
   genetic contamination of feral populations in the event of their escape,
   such risk should be regarded as of minimal biological significance.
   Whether transgenic animals can pose a threat of zoonotic transmission of
   disease must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, though no such event
   has yet been documented.}},

Abstract = {{The most economical blood test for the monitoring of workers who are
   exposed to organophosphate pesticides is serum cholinesterase; however,
   serum cholinesterase can be affected by conditions other than pesticide
   exposure. The results of studies in Europe indicate a 4\% prevalence of
   congenital serum cholinesterase deficiency. Prevalence rates in the
   United States have not been reported. In this study, 127 workers who
   were part of an employee health program were evaluated. Workers who had
   decreased serum cholinesterase levels on baseline testing before
   pesticide exposure were evaluated far a congenital deficit in serum
   cholinesterase. Five (3.9\%) individuals had baseline measurements below
   the laboratory normal reference value: 4 (3.1\%) were heterozygote for
   the deficiency, and the remaining individual did not return to test for
   the genetic deficiency. Na one was found to have the homozygote
   deficiency. The prevalence of congenital deficiency in serum
   cholinesterase in a midwestern population was 3.1-3.9\%. We found ii

Abstract = {{A review of the literature for the hormonal control of reproduction and
   diapause in Coleoptera is presented. The role of juvenile hormone and
   juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) in the control of the different life
   history strategies of the boil weevil are examined. Elevated levels of
   hemolymph JHE were found to be positively correlated with survival
   throughout the winter in South Texas population of weevils. Winter
   weevils were examined for hemolymph vitellogenin (Vg) and their
   subsequent survival was monitored. The majority of weevils surviving
   beyond ten weeks had no hemolymph Vg. We conclude that elevated
   hemolymph]HE and the absence of Vg are good predictors of survivors in
   the South Texas population. The hormonal basis of diapause termination
   was examined using hormone treatment and implant therapy. We were
   unsuccessful in our attempt to induce post-diapause reproductive
   development with all of our treatments. Only weevils given access to a
   food source were capable of reproductive development. Our recent
   experimental findings in the control of Vg synthesis and uptake in the
   boil weevil are reviewed. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   introduced initially, resident as well as introduced nematodes
   multiplied subsequently to various specific levels at different
   localities. Generally, population densities of M. javanica and resident
   nematodes at a particular site were higher at time of ratoon- than
   plant-crop harvest, and In irrigated than non-irrigated plots. Fruit
   yields of the ratoon-crop were equal to or lower than the plant-crop,
   and were more affected in irrigated than in non-irrigated plots. Site
   location, irrigation and time of crop harvest were important factors
   influencing the rate as well as the final level of a nematode population
   build-up. The feasibility of exploiting these factors for nematode
   control should be further studied.}},

Abstract = {{Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh. var. australasica (Walp.) Moldenke
   occurs as monospecific stands in the North Island of New Zealand. Using
   5 m wide strip transects, A. marina adult plants and seedlings were
   mapped out in eight distinctive mangrove forests. All forests showed
   reversed `J' size distributions of adult plants. In most cases, seedling
   density increased with increasing distance from the seaward edge of the
   mangrove forests. Mean plant size and density with respect to tidal
   position showed no consistent pattern across forests. Plant size seemed
   correlated with latitudinal gradient, with taller trees in relatively
   warmer regions and shorter, stunted, dwarf-like types in colder areas.
   The survival and growth of (a) naturally occurring seedlings in and out
   of tree-fall gaps and at various distances from the seaward edge of the
   forest, and (b) transplanted seedlings of different sizes (small, medium
   and large propagules: less than or equal to 10 cm, 10-20 cm and 21-40 cm
   tall, respectively) and densities (2, 5 and 9 seedlings m(-2)) in three
   delineated (low, mid and high) intertidal positions were monitored over
   18-month periods. Establishment of both natural and transplanted
   seedlings varied significantly between locations, canopy light
   conditions, intertidal levels and seedling sizes, but not with density.
   Generally, seedling survival and growth were better in gaps than under
   closed canopy, irrespective of tidal position. Intertidal level
   significantly affected survival of transplanted seedlings, but did so
   only marginally for the natural ones, with survival being greatest in
   the high intertidal zone. By contrast, increases in plant height and
   leaf production were best promoted in the low intertidal position of the
   forest floor. Survival of the transplanted seedlings was of the order:
   large > small greater than or equal to medium-sized. However, the small
   seedlings grew best both in terms of height and accumulation of new
   leaves. These patterns of survival and growth were consistent across
   intertidal position and seedling density. The implication of these
   results for the conservation and possible restoration of mangrove
   forests, especially in New Zealand, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The basic demographic parameters of six Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus
   fasciatus populations in Spain and France were calculated from field
   data obtained in the last 15 years. Average annual productivity ranged
   from 0.36 to 1.24 young/pair and average annual adult survival from 84\%
   to 96\%. Preadult survival (from fledging to recruitment) was estimated
   at 10\%. All the populations were declining at annual rates ranging from
   -7.3 to -1.1\%. Although no statistically significant disagreement was
   observed between the predictions of a Leslie matrix model fitted to the
   population parameters and the real trends, some populations declined
   faster and others more slowly than expected. These differences were
   interpreted as a result of differential emigration, recruitment rates or
   preadult survival not accounted for by the model. Since the intrinsic
   population growth rate was about four times less sensitive to changes in
   preadult survival than to changes in adult survival, and about ten times
   less sensitive to changes in fecundity and predispersal survival,
   conservation efforts must be primarily directed towards increasing adult
   and preadult survival. Power line casualties and direct persecution must
   be eliminated in order to reduce mortality. Priorities on research
   should address dispersal, mortality and habitat relationships involving
   these two parameters. Monitoring should be extended to other
   populations. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited}},

   Manitoba from 1987-1996 revealed a continuous population decline from 34
   known nesting pairs to only one. Management activities are discussed
   including public awareness programs, reintroductions, habitat protection
   and provision of artificial nest burrows. Nest reuse in consecutive
   years ranged from 7 percent for 57 failed nests to 23 percent for 122
   successful nests. Only 14 percent of unsuccessful territories were
   reused compared to 51 percent of successful sites. Higher nest
   reoccupancy rates were noted for artificial burrows (44 percent; n=27)
   than for natural nests (13 percent; n=152). Low return rates of banded
   juveniles (3.5 percent; n=538) and adults (32.7 percent; n=165) suggest
   that reduced survivorship may be a contributing factor to observed
   declines. Adult males returned more frequently (40.2 percent) than
   females (24.4 percent). Males were more frequently re-encountered at the
   same nest (51 percent) or within I km (94 percent) than females (33
   percent and 56 percent, respectively). Average dispersal distances
   between years were 3.0 km for adult males (n=35) and 10.9 km for adult
   females (n=18). Average dispersal distances for juveniles ranged from
   1-77 km, averaging 29.5 km for 9 males and 33.7 km for 9 females.
   Average brood size (5.1 yg/pr) and overall productivity (3.4 yg/nesting

Abstract = {{Long Point Bird Observatory ran pilot surveys in 1995 and 1996 to
   monitor boreal forest owls in Ontario using roadside surveys with tape
   playback of calls. A minimum of 791 owls on 84 routes in 1995, and 392
   owls on 88 routes in 1996; nine different species were detected.
   Playback improved the response rate for Barred (Strix varia), Boreal
   (Aegolius funereus), Northern Saw-whet (Aegolius acadicus) and possibly
   Great Gray (Strix nebulosa) Owls, and reduced variance among surveys for
   Barred Owls. Relatively few, long stops produced the most efficient
   survey for Barred Owls, while more numerous, shorter stops were optimal
   for Boreal and Northern Saw-whet Owls. Power estimates suggest that
   about 50 routes per species should be adequate to detect a uniform 20
   percent decline over 10 years (2.2 percent per year) for Boreal and
   Northern Saw-whet Owls, and a 50 percent decline for Barred and Great
   Gray Owls (6.7 percent per year). However, some species were detected on
   many fewer than 50 routes, and models of uniform population changes may
   not be relevant for owls. For example, 60-80 percent fewer Northern
   Saw-whet and Boreal Owls (P < 0.001) were detected in 1996 than 1995 on
   routes that were run in both years, possibly related to emigration of
   many of these owls out of the study areas the preceding winter.}},

Abstract = {{The ecology and behavior of non-territorial owls are basically unknown.
   I studied the integration of young Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus)
   into the territorial breeding population from 1988-1993 in the
   southwestern Yukon, Canada, during a peak and decline of the population
   cycle of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). Fifty-five fledglings were
   equipped with radio-transmitters that allowed weekly monitoring of
   individuals for 2-3 years. After a synchronized dispersal phase in each
   September, 29-45 percent remained within 35 km of their natal
   territories. Although 15 percent settled in a territory and were capable
   of reproducing before the end of their first year of life, most of these
   owls became non-territorial floaters. Several lines of evidence
   indicated that this behavior was caused by territorial exclusion of
   breeding pairs. Floaters were secretive and mostly resident within home
   ranges that were about five times the size of average territories.
   Movement patterns suggested that floaters were not involved in
   extra-pair matings, and that floating is not an alternative reproductive
   strategy. Survival of floaters was very high during peak densities of
   prey, leading to a proportion of 40-50 percent of non-territorial owls
   in the population. When numbers of snowshoe hares declined, emigration
   and mortality rates increased in floaters before territory owners were
   affected. The results of this study show how a large proportion of
   secretive floaters can delay the detection of population declines in
   traditional censuses of territorial birds, and can lead to serious
   underestimates of the impacts of predation.}},

Abstract = {{In 1982, the Raptor Grid, a nation-wide program for monitoring birds of
   prey was started by the Finnish Ringing Centre. Voluntary banders were
   asked to select a 10 x 10 km study plot and find annually all active
   nests or at least occupied territories of birds of prey from their study
   plot (annual total averaged 120). Since 1986, additional information was
   collected with the Raptor Questionnaire. In 1996, more than 30,000
   potential nest sites of owls were checked. The maximum annual number of
   nests were: e.g., Tengmalm's Owl 2,265, Ural Owl 901, Long-eared Owl
   578, Tawny Owl 548, and Eagle Owl 537 nests. During the program,
   populations remained stable, although the annual fluctuations were
   extensive. International cooperation is needed to monitor nomadic
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Practitioners have been using numerous methods to protect Burrowing Owls
   (Speotyto cunicularia hypugaea) affected by human activities. Primary
   approaches include protecting birds and burrows in place, allowing birds
   to relocate within their nesting territory, allowing birds to colonize
   new patches, moving birds within the geographic region and moving birds
   outside the geographic region. Very little data are readily available on
   most of these. Preliminary information indicates that methods which keep
   birds near nest burrows may be more successful than those in which birds
   are relocated outside nesting territories. Adequate monitoring is
   necessary when using these methods and more data are required to
   ascertain which conditions will produce successful breeding populations.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of a Douglas-fir seed orchard by host-specific seed
   chalcids immigrating from the surrounding plantations of Douglas-fir has
   been monitored for a 10-year period. The orchard cone crop was entirely
   harvested every year to prevent the establishment of a resident chalcid
   population. Over the 10 years the percentage of infested seeds resulting
   from the immigration of seed chalcids ranged from 0.88 to 91.0\%. A
   model to forecast the importance of annual seed orchard infestation by
   immigrating populations is proposed. This model is based on passive
   diffusion of females emerging in the surrounding plantations with a
   downwind drift, Only a few plantations located within a radius of 5 km
   from the orchard appeared to contribute significantly to orchard
   infestation. Settlement of Douglas-fir orchard in regions with low
   density of conspecific trees and annual harvest of cones are suggested
   to limit the importance and regularity of seed chalcid damage.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined whether simple indicators of condition in individual
   Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are related to biochemical composition and
   energy content for the whole range of conditions potentially observed in
   natural populations. The energy content of muscle was largely associated
   with its protein content, while liver energy content mainly consisted of
   lipids. Accurate predictions of muscle and liver energy content can also
   be made from the measurement of their water content. Relationships
   between energy content, water content, and simple measures such as
   condition factor and hepatosomatic index provide a fast and accurate
   assessment of seasonal changes in total available energy reserves in
   cod. These indices could advantageously be used to monitor the status
   and recovery of cod stocks and to ensure improved management of that
   resource.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first information on waterbirds, especially breeding
   marine birds, from 3 islands of d'Entrecasteaux Reefs (Surprise, Fabre
   and Huon), northern New Caledonia, southwestern Pacific. Using different
   sampling and counting techniques, we recorded 20 waterbird species: 14
   were seabirds, of the 23 known to breed in the New Caledonian region.
   The most significant seabird populations include large colonies of
   Red-footed Booby (Sula sula rubripes) on Surprise, Sooty Tern (Sterna
   fuscata serrata) and Black Noddy (Anous tenuirostris minutus) on Fabre,
   and Brown Noddy (A. stolidus) on Huon. Results of population estimates
   are discussed in terms of methodology and compared with those obtained
   from previous expeditions. Overall, the species community has been
   stable over the last 10 years, although variations in numbers may be
   difficult to assess as there are no reliable counting methods. We
   discuss counting techniques in order to improve future monitoring of
   seabird populations of tropical islets that are seldom visited.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding and wintering herons and egrets have been monitored for 29
   years in southern France and for 21 years in northwest Italy, 2 regions
   with internationally important populations. During this period, data
   were collected regularly on breeding success and nest site use and
   availability. Feeding habitat use and prey availability have also been
   assessed during a series of breeding seasons. We review some of the
   information collected during these long-term studies, and we appraise
   how this information contributes to understanding population regulation,
   assessing vulnerability factors, and setting conservation priorities. A
   minimum of 25 years of population monitoring appears to be necessary to
   witness 1 or more episodes of climate perturbations and to begin
   evaluating their effects on a population, though some questions e.g.,
   those relating to breeding biology, may be answered during shorter
   periods. The appropriate spatial scale also depends on the question
   asked. The Camargue forms an ideal spatial unit for the study of
   breeding biology and population dynamics, i.e., a group of colonies that
   constitutes a discrete, relatively isolated population. The size of the
   latter allows assessment of numbers of breeding and wintering birds, of
   climatic conditions, of reproductive success, mortality and dispersal
   rates based on sightings of marked birds. However, for migrant species
   an assessment of the conditions in overwintering areas also is
   necessary. Conservation efforts have focused so far mainly on colony
   site protection. In Italy, this has led to the establishment of a
   network of nature reserves for colonially breeding Ardeidae. These
   measures have been successful, but a number of vulnerability factors
   exist which are more difficult to deal with. The largest heron
   population in northwest Italy depends for its food on ricefields and is
   therefore vulnerable to changing practices in rice cultivation.
   According to recent analyses environmental contaminant concentrations
   are not considered at present a serious problem in Italy. In the
   Camargue, management of freshwater marshes for hunting purposes and
   harvesting of reed (Phragmites australis) also destroy many of the
   Purple Heron's potential nesting sites.}},

Abstract = {{The Camargue delta of the Rhone River (southern France) is the only
   place in France where the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber roseus
   breeds, and it is the most important breeding site in the western
   Mediterranean. The numbers of breeding pairs and chicks raised have been
   monitored for 50 years (1947-1996). Following intensive management of
   this colony, the number of birds breeding in the Camargue increased from
   4,000-5,000 pairs in the 1950s to an average of 13,500 in 1986-1996.
   Since the size of the colony is limited by the size of its island, this
   led to the expansion of the number of breeding sites in the western
   Mediterranean as a whole. Banding studies begun in the 1940s have shown
   that flamingos of Camargue origin exploit wetlands throughout much of
   the Mediterranean region and west Africa. Some individuals are
   sedentary, while others are migratory or opportunistic. Studies of the
   flamingo indicate that 1) single colonies such as the Camargue can be
   managed successfully enough to serve as a source population that can
   fuel expansion into an entire region, 2) movements and reproductive
   success of birds in the Camargue colony extend to the entire western
   Mediterranean region, 3) feeding areas of individual colonies may be up
   to 180 km from colonies, and 4) long term studies (50 yr) have revealed
   that mortality is extremely episodic and unpredictable; only long-term
   studies therefore seem capable of accurate estimation of demographics
   for this long-lived species.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the primary regulatory factor of Snail Kite
   (Rostrhamus sociabilis) populations in Florida is periodic drought.
   Consequently, the need for drought refugia has been previously
   identified as essential to the viability of kites. However, rainfall
   patterns across Florida are quite variable and the spatial and temporal
   patterns of drought have been largely ignored. We suggest that the
   primary response of Snail Kites to local drying events is behavioral;
   birds simply move to a different location. Small localized drying events
   occur at a relatively high frequency, whereas widespread droughts that
   encompass the entire range of Snail Kites in Florida are relatively
   rare. The occurrence of simultaneous drying events also is inversely
   correlated with distance between wetlands, resulting in greater
   asynchrony of drying events at larger spatial scales. Consequently, a
   large spatial extent helps to ensure that some refugia are available
   during most droughts. This enables individuals to escape the effects of
   droughts by moving.
   Several management recommendations have focused on maintaining
   continuous inundation of wetland habitats; however, the lack of periodic
   drying can detrimentally affect the kites' nesting and foraging habitat.
   We suggest that ensuring adequate refugia from drought can, and should,
   be accomplished by maintaining suitable habitat across a large enough
   area (including habitats in several different watersheds) to include
   climatic variability, rather than by prolonging local inundation. A
   broad spatial extent enables areas to incur periodic drying (necessary
   for plant communities) on a rotational basis through climatic
   variability. Monitoring also must occur over time periods long enough to
   detect not only the short-term response of birds to a given drying
   event, but also the long-term response of the habitat to water
   management regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Most bird monitoring programs aim at detecting changes in numbers in
   order to estimate the health of populations, to identify the causes of
   fluctuations, or to measure the success of management. These objectives
   may be difficult to attain for colonial waterbirds. Large scale
   movements, unpredictable dispersion and demographic factors related to
   long lived birds tend to limit the indicative value of bird numbers,
   particularly at the local scale. In the Camargue region of France, 9
   species of colonial Charadriiformes have been monitored since 1956. For
   5 species, regional breeding population fluctuations did not indicate
   actual conservation problems. For at least 3 species, numbers increased
   as a result of immigration and the Camargue is apparently a sink.
   Breeding success may be a more powerful indicator of population health.
   A comparative analysis of numbers at different spatial scales seems
   necessary to identify species-specific causes of changes in numbers, and

Abstract = {{Depending on levels of historical and contemporary gene flow, the
   spatial scale of populations of colonial waterbirds may range from
   individual colonies to entire species. Understanding the spatial scale
   of populations is important for conservation for several reasons: (1)
   for estimating levels of gene flow and thus the capacity for natural
   recolonization; (2) for conserving genetic resources both within
   individuals and within species; (3) for assessing the scale of impact of
   natural and anthropogenic mortality; (4) for identifying appropriate
   sites for population monitoring and restoration; (5) for determining a
   colony's uniqueness; (6) for identifying source and sink populations;
   and (7) for estimating effective population sizes. The geographic scales
   of populations may be estimated from direct observations of demographics
   and/or from a variety of molecular techniques; the most powerful studies
   combine 2 or more methods. Recent studies of murres and murrelets
   indicate the importance of understanding the spatial scale of
   populations for conservation. Although few investigations have been done
   on colonial waterbirds, preliminary analyses of published studies
   suggest that the geographic scales of populations tend to be greater in
   species with an ``island{''} type population structure or an offshore
   foraging mode than in those with a ``stepping-stone{''} type of
   population structure or an inshore foraging mode. In some cases, the
   spatial scale of a population may be smaller than the colony.}},

Abstract = {{The Native Plant Society of Oregon (NPSO) is committed to the
   preservation, conservation and study of Oregon's native flora. As a
   statewide non-profit organization composed of 12 chapters, NPSO's role
   in the conservation of native plants is not tied to legislative mandates
   or directives. We are motivated by our interest and concern for Oregon's
   native plants. We recognize that conservation is fundamentally a matter
   of how we treat the land, and that real threats-logging, grazing,
   road-building, commercial and residential development, mining,
   agriculture, certain recreational activities (downhill skiing and
   off-road vehicles)-must be addressed by providing information about
   their impacts on native vegetation to appropriate resource
   agencies/managers and elected officials. At the state and chapter
   levels, NPSO members work to learn more about Oregon's native plants and
   to influence management decisions that affect our botanical resources.
   Chapter-level conservation activities include monitoring populations of
   rare plants and invasive introduced plants, work parties to restore
   natural areas, and involvement in local planning and resource management
   issues that threaten native species and plant communities. Specific
   state and chapter-level conservation activities are described.}},

Abstract = {{Bensoniella (Bensoniella oregana) is a rare saxifrage known from about
   80 locations in the Klamath region of southwest Oregon and northwest
   California, usually semi-shaded sites where well-drained soil remains
   moist into the summer. This study began in 1990 with the discovery of
   numerous seedlings in the California populations, challenging the
   previous assumption that reproduction is primarily vegetative.
   Greenhouse plantings and seedlings in the field were monitored to try to
   identify environmental factors associated with germination and survival.
   When early results suggested that germination is facilitated by light,
   the study narrowed to focus on the role of light on the ecology of
   bensoniella. Additional work showed that seed buried in pots can remain
   viable for several years, and confirmed that older plants have a limited
   tolerance for direct sunlight. The study suggests that bensoniella may
   form persistent seed banks. The apparently narrow range of suitable
   light and moisture levels helps account for the small size and
   fragmentation of the populations.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the impact of room ventilation on animal cage
   microenvironment, intracage ventilation rate, temperature, humidity, and
   concentrations of carbon dioxide and ammonia were monitored in
   nonpressurized, bonnet-topped mouse cages, Cages on the top, middle, and
   bottom rows of a mouse rack were monitored at room ventilation rates of
   0, 5, 10, and 20 air changes/h (AGH), Ventilation inside the animal cage
   increased somewhat from 12.8 to 18.9 ACH as room ventilation rate
   increased from 0 to 20 AGH, but the differences were not statistically
   significant, and most of the increase occurred in cages in the top row
   nearest to the fresh air supply, Cages containing mice had ventilation
   rate between 10 and 15 ACH even when room ventilation was reduced to 0
   AGH; this ventilation is a result of the thermal heat load of the mice,
   After 6 days of soiled bedding, intracage ammonia concentration was < 3
   ppm at all room ventilation rates and was not affected by increasing
   room ventilation, Temperature inside cages did not change with
   increasing ventilation, Humidity inside cages significantly decreased
   with increasing ventilation, from 55\% relative humidity at 5 ACH to
   36\% relative humidity at 20 AGH. Carbon dioxide concentration decreased
   from 2,500 ppm to 1,900 ppm when ventilation rate increased from 5 ACH
   to 10 AGH, but no further significant decrease was observed at 20 AGH.
   In conclusion, increasing the room ventilation rate higher than 5 ACH
   did not result in significant improvements in the cage microenvironment.}},

Abstract = {{Livingstone's fruit bat Pteropus livingstonii (Gray 1866) is one of the
   most endangered Old World fruit bats, found in the wild on only two
   islands in the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros (RFIC) in the
   western Indian Ocean. The fourth expedition in six years was made to the
   island of Anjouan in 1995, in order to capture additional P.
   livingstonii females to augment the captive breeding colony held at the
   Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (JWPT) and to census the population.
   Using capture methods based on those developed during previous
   expeditions, 23 male P. livingstonii, 42 Pteropus seychellensis
   comorensis and 72 Rousettus obliviosus were caught, measured and
   released on Anjouan. Five female P. livingstonii were caught and
   transported to JWPT, bringing the total captive population to seven wild
   caught females, ten wild-caught males and nine juveniles born and
   surviving in captivity as of November 1997. In addition, previously
   distributed educational materials prompted island residents to come
   forward with information about three new P. livingstonii roosting sites.
   A simultaneous count of these and previously known roosts yielded a
   minimum population on Anjouan of 332 individuals. When combined with
   other counts of the Moheli population, this provides an estimate of
   approximately 400 Livingstone's fruit bats in total. The most important
   factors in capture success proved to be previous reconnaissance, timing,
   and improved equipment. The significant male bias in P. livingstonii
   captures is probably due to seasonal and feeding site effects, rather
   than a bias in the total population. The number of wild-caught
   individuals currently in captivity appears to be sufficient for the time
   being to fulfil adequately most functions of the captive breeding
   programme. Therefore, resources in the near future are best directed
   towards habitat preservation, continued monitoring of the wild
   population, public education programmes, establishment of a permanent
   field station in the RFIC and sound management of animals already in
   captivity.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly ten years after its conception, a recovery programme for the
   critically endangered pigmy hog Sus salvanius was formally approved, and
   an implementation plan agreed, by the signing of an International
   Conservation Management and Research Agreement (ICMRA) on 16 February
   1995 at the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, in
   New Delhi. This Agreement, the first of its kind in India, was signed by
   senior representatives of the four collaborating parties: the Union
   Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India; the Assam
   State Forest Department, Government of Assam; the IUCN/SSC Pigs and
   Peccaries Specialist Group (PPSG); and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation
   Trust (JWPT). A successful funding application by the JWPT to the
   European Union also ensured the majority of funding support for the
   first three years.
   The Agreement is based around a Three-point Action Plan for the
   Conservation of the Pigmy Hog, which was drafted in April 1985 at the
   invitation of the Joint Secretary for Wildlife in the Union Ministry.
   The Action Plan was formulated by the PPSG, but based largely on the
   results of field research sponsored by JWPT and conducted in close
   collaboration with the Wildlife Division of the Assam Forest Department,
   some of whose officers were also instrumental in the formulation of the
   ICMRA. The history of these events is outlined, along with an account of
   the major activities and progress made since the signing of the
   Agreement. These activities have included: appointment and training of
   project staff and appointment of scientitic consultants; acquisition of
   project vehicle and other equipment; conduct of preliminary field
   surveys; selection and development of the Pigmy Hog Research and
   Breeding Centre at Basistha; capture of six (2.4) hogs as founders for
   the breeding programme, development of husbandry procedures and
   birth/rearing of the first 12 (6.6) hogs at Basistha; capture,
   radio-collaring, release and monitoring of a further four (3.1) hogs;
   initiation of behaviour, reproductive and life-history studies of
   captive hogs, and activity rhythms, ranging patterns and ecological
   studies of wild hogs; initiation and development of longer-term ecology
   and management studies of tall grasslands; and development of
   recommendations for the enhanced future protection and management of
   remnant hog populations and grasslands in Manas, Barnadi and other
   selected areas.}},

Abstract = {{Western Burkina-Faso is a pole of intense population migration that
   conducts to problems of space saturation and land degradation. The
   present study deals with the natural vegetation characterization of this
   legion using the High Resolution Visible and InfraRed (HRVIR) sensor
   that will be launched on SPOT4.
   We adopted a theoretical approach which consists in evaluating the
   capacity of the future Short Wavelength InfraRed (SWIR) band to
   discriminate natural vegetation types using a 3D radiative transfer
   model (Myneni's model). Simulations were conducted with realistic input
   parameters (different vegetation structure, soil, satellite, atmospheric
   conditions...) during dry and rainy seasons. The outputs of the
   simulations (bi-directional reflectances, Vegetation Indices) were used
   to study the sensitivity of the SWIR to vegetation type and to external
   conditions.
   The results show that the SWIR band is well correlated with the Red
   channel during the wet season, and with the Near InfraRed (NIR) and Red
   channels during the dry season. Its sensitivity to the atmosphere is
   low, and the sensitivity to the soil type is medium. The sensitivity to
   the woody cover is high during the dry season (about 1.6 points of
   reflectance per 10\%, of woody cover) but is still equivalent to the NIR
   sensitivity. Spectral Vegetation Indices including SWIR do not provide
   additional information on the structure of the vegetation canopy.}},

Abstract = {{A field trial was conducted using an oil formulation of the
   entomopathogenic fungus. Metarhizium flavoviride Gams \& Rozsypal
   (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes), to control the variegated grasshopper:
   Zonocerus variegatus L. (Orthoptera: Pyrgomorphidae). The influence of
   dispersal and secondary pick-up from the spray residue on mortality was
   assessed by sampling insects from the treated plots at intervals and
   monitoring disease levels during subsequent incubation in the
   laboratory. The cumulative mortality curves showed the pathogen to be
   highly effective, even in samples taken 8 days after spraying. A model
   was developed to link the influence of mortality, incubation, secondary
   pick-up of spores and insect dispersal, on the shape of these cumulative
   mortality curves. The model proved useful for data received from an
   experiment using small plot sizes, where insect dispersal is a big
   problem. The spray residue had an important influence on overall insect
   mortality. The model also indicated a difference in speed of kill
   between field and laboratory samples, suggesting an incubation delay in
   the field.}},

Title = {{Environmental and biomarker measurements in nine homes in the Lower Rio
   Grande Valley: Multimedia results for pesticides, metals, PAHs, and VOCs}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Residential environmental and biomarker measurements were made of
   multiple pollutants during two seasons (spring and summer, 1993) in
   order to assess human exposure for a purposeful sample of 18 nonsmoking
   adults residing within nine homes (a primary and secondary subject in
   each home) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) near Brownsville, TX.
   Pesticides, metals, PAHs, VOCs, and PCBs were measured in drinking
   water, food, air, soil, and house dust over a one-to two-day period in
   each season. Biomarker measurements were made in blood, breath, and
   urine. A total of 375 measurements across five pollutant classes (227
   pesticides, 44 trace elements, 78 VOCs, 18 PAHs, and 8 PCBs) was
   possible for each home in one or more media. A large percentage of the
   measurements was below the method limit of detection ranging from 0-37\%
   for pesticides, 22-61\% for metals, 6\% and 90\% for VOCs in water and
   air, respectively, and 0-74\% for PAHs. The total number of analytes
   measurable in blood, urine, or breath was considerably less, i.e., 58
   (21 pesticides, 1 PCB, 4 metals, 31 VOCs, and 1 PAH) with the percentage
   above the method limit of detection for pesticides and metals ranging
   from 40 to 100\%, while for VOCs, PAHs, and PCBs, this percentage ranged
   from 2 to 33\%. A significant seasonal difference (p less than or equal
   to 0.10) was found in the biomarker levels of two of seven nonpersistent
   pesticides (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and 2,5-dichlorophenol) and 3 of
   3 metals (arsenic, cadmium, and mercury) and the pyrene metabolite,
   1-hydroxypyrene, measured in urine. In all cases, levels were higher in
   the summer relative to the spring. For the persistent pesticides and
   PCBs in blood serum, a seasonal effect could be evaluated for 5 of 10
   analytes; a significant difference (p less than or equal to 0.10) was
   observed only for hexachlorobenzene, which like the urine biomarkers,
   was higher in the summer. In contrast to the urine metals, blood-Pb
   concentrations did not change significantly (p less than or equal to
   0.05) from spring to summer. Biological results from the current study
   are compared to the reference range furnished by the Third National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Comparisons are
   only suggestive due to limitations in comparability between the two
   studies. Based on the percentage of measurements above the detection
   limit, a significant elevation (p less than or equal to 0.10) in 2 of 12
   nonpersistent pesticides (4-nitrophenol and 2,4-D) was observed for the
   LRGV study subjects. The VOC carbon tetrachloride was found in the blood
   (monitored only in spring) with greater prevalence (p less than or equal
   to 0.10) than would be expected from NHANES III results. Blood serum
   levels of two persistent pesticides (4,4'-DDE, and trans-nonachlor) and
   PCB exceeded median and/or 95th percentile reference levels as did
   arsenic in urine. Where seasonal differences were identified or for
   compounds exceeding reference levels, environmental monitoring results
   were investigated to identify potential contributing pathways and
   sources of exposure. However, because environmental sampling did not
   always coincide with the biological sampling and because of the high
   frequency of analytes measured below the limit of detection, sources and
   pathways of exposure in many cases could not be explained. Chlorpyrifos
   was an exception where urine metabolite (3,5,6-TCP) levels were found to
   be significantly correlated with air (R-2=0.55; p less than or equal to
   0.01) and dust (R-2=0.46; p less than or equal to 0.01) concentrations.
   Based on the results of biomarker and residential environmental
   measurements over two seasons, this scoping study shows a seasonal
   effect for some analytes and suggests where exposures may be high for
   others. This information may be useful in considering future studies in
   the region. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In January 1993 the oil tanker Braer ran aground in the Shetland
   islands, Scotland. Approximately 80,000 ions of crude oil were released.
   Exceptionally high winds caused extensive pollution and exposure of the
   local population to crude oil. We describe the study which was
   immediately set in place to examine the exposed population for evidence
   of genotoxic exposure. Brood samples were token and primary DNA damage
   was measured in the mononuclear cell fraction by the butanol
   modification of the P-32-postlabelling method. Mutation was measured at
   the hprt locus in T lymphocytes. No evidence of genotoxicity was
   obtained for either end point, but nevertheless, we believe that useful
   lessons were learnt, which should be incorporated into the design of
   future studies: (1) A rapid response is essential, and even if
   sufficient funds are not immediately available, it is still worth
   attempting to obtain samples quickly and use cryopreservation, also to
   attempt to estimate exposure. (2) Adequate numbers of volunteers must be
   sought, together with enough controls, not just to allow meaningful
   analysis but to overcome toss of samples and failure of things to go
   according to plan. (3) Points concerning laboratory practice include:
   (i) samples should be coded, (ii) clearly defined and proven protocols
   should be used, (iii) irreplaceable samples should not be used for
   method development, (iv) should a problem become apparent during the
   study, work on such samples should cease immediately until the problem
   is solved, (v) all critical experimental components should be pretested
   against a laboratory standard. (4) The study design should include
   replicate experiments to monitor experimental variability and
   reproducibility, as well os internal standards and cryopreserved `'in
   house'' samples. Care must be token that samples from any one exposure
   group are spread between a number of independent experiments and that
   each experiment includes samples from a number of exposure groups. (5) A
   computerised data base should be maintained with full details of
   experimental variables, donor attributes, and raw data so that any
   contribution of experimental artefacts to `'outlier'' results can be
   monitored. (6) Because of the nature of the statistical variation for
   many environmental genotoxicity end points, only a large-scale study is
   likely to be capable of yielding useful information. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine whether changes in the repair
   capacity of blood cells could be used as a valuable biomarker for
   radiation exposure. To characterize the repair kinetics in nonirradiated
   and irradiated cells we first performed in vitro split dose experiments.
   DNA damage and DNA repair capacity were analysed using the comet assay.
   Our results showed that the first in vitro irradiation effects the
   repair system of the cells, resulting in a decreased repair capacity
   after the second irradiation. Furthermore, the second irradiation
   results in a large amount of DNA damage in the blood cells. To test
   whether the analysis of the DNA repair capacity after in vitro
   irradiation is also a valuable method for in vivo studies of donors
   exposed to radiation, we analysed the repair capacity of blood cells of
   two exposed groups: patients subjected to a radioiodine therapy and
   chronically irradiated volunteers from the Chernobyl region. Both groups
   also showed a significantly impaired repair capacity indicating a stress
   on the hematopoietic system. In addition, in the group of the Ukrainians
   DNA damage after in vitro irradiation was significantly higher than in a
   control group. These results lead to the presumption that the repair
   capacity and the DNA damage after in vitro irradiation might be a very
   useful biological marker For radiation exposure in population
   monitoring. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A human volunteer study was conducted to test the effect of vitamin C
   supplementation on biomarkers of oxygen radical-mediated damage in
   individuals with a range of serum cholesterol levels.
   A group of 48 non-smokers, 24 men and 24 women, was selected from a
   panel of over 100 volunteers to give as wide a range of serum
   cholesterol levels as possible. None of the volunteers was taking
   medication to control cholesterol levels and they maintained their
   normal dietary habits so as not to compromise their cholesterol status.
   Volunteers were allocated to three groups of 16, each consisting of four
   males with low cholesterol levels (<6 mmol/L) matched for age and build
   with four males with high cholesterol levels (>6 mmol/L) and eight
   females matched in the some way. A three-treatment, three-treatment
   period, cross-over design was adopted to take account of any temporal
   differences in response. The three treatments given were placebo, 60 mg
   vitamin C/day (the recommended daily allowance) and 6 g vitamin C/day.
   Each treatment was given for 14 days with 6 weeks between the treatment
   periods. All procedures were performed to the standards of Good Clinical
   Practice.
   Blood samples were taken at the end of each treatment period. Serum was
   assayed for cholesterol whilst vitamin C, total antioxidant capacity,
   lipid peroxidation breakdown products and ras p21 protein levels were
   measured in plasma. lymphocytes were examined for DNA damage using the
   Comet assay and chromosome aberration test. The Comet assay was
   conducted with and without challenge with hydrogen peroxide and the
   chromosome aberration test with and without challenge with bleomycin.
   Vitamin C supplementation caused a statistically significant increase in
   plasma vitamin C concentrations and total antioxidant capacity but did
   not affect cholesterol levels or ras p21 protein levels. There was a
   non-significant dose-related decrease in lipid peroxidation breakdown
   products with vitamin C supplementation. No effect on DNA damage was
   observed in the Comet assay, either with or without hydrogen peroxide
   challenge, or in the chromosome aberration test without bleomycin.
   However, a statistically significant increase in bleomycin-induced
   aberrations was Found after vitamin C supplementation. This may be due
   to effects of vitamin C on iron status. Comparison of male and female
   subjects showed statistically significant differences in plasma vitamin
   C levels, the antioxidant capacity of the plasma and the number of
   chromosome aberrations induced by bleomycin challenge of lymphocytes in
   vitro.
   The results were the same for both low and high cholesterol subjects.
   This study provides no evidence of a beneficial effect on any of the
   biomarkers studied of vitamin C supplementation over a short-term
   supplementation period of 2 weeks in a population of healthy,
   non-smoking individuals eating a nutritionally adequate diet. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The toxicological in-patient hospital in Budapest is responsible for the
   care of chemically poisoned persons from a population of 3 million. A
   population-based prospective epidemiological study of all pregnant women
   admitted from 1985 to 1993 was used to evaluate effects of large doses
   of chemicals on human fetal development. Of 559 self-poisoned pregnant
   women identified, two died from the poisoning. A total of 213 fetuses
   were in the first month of their postconception development. Of these,
   126 had evaluated pregnancy outcomes: 111 ended in very early loss, 3
   ended in clinical miscarriage, and 12 survived to delivery. (In addition
   73 pregnancies were terminated and one pregnant woman died.) The 12
   liveborn infants had two congenital abnormalities that were probably not
   related to their mother's self-poisoning. Though based on small numbers,
   these findings are consistent with on `'all-or-nothing'' effect of
   chemical poisoning very early in human gestation. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Chromosomal aberrations are associated with cancer, birth defects, and
   pregnancy loss. Previous studies using banding techniques have revealed
   that chromosomal alterations induced in human peripheral lymphocytes by
   many genotoxic agents occur nonrandomly throughout the genome. One of
   the regions prone to breakage is the centromeric heterochromatin of
   chromosome 1. We have developed a fluorescence in situ hybridization
   (FISH) procedure using tandem DNA probes to distinguish hyperdiploidy
   From breakage occurring in this region. Interphase nuclei exhibiting
   breakage or exchanges affecting the 1cen-1q12 region can readily be
   distinguished from nuclei hyperdiploid for this chromosome by
   identifying the number and location of the hybridization signals. This
   hybridization approach was tested using cultured human lymphocytes
   treated with a series of known aneuploidy-inducing agents (colchicine,
   diethylstilbestrol, and vincristine sulfate), several potent clastogens
   (ionizing radiation, mitomycin C, and etoposide), as well as sodium
   arsenite and hydroquinone, agents that have been reported to have
   relatively weak aneuploidy-inducing and clastogenic activity.
   Significant increases in chromosomal alterations were seen with all
   agents tested and the results were generally consistent with those
   previously seen using standard cytogenetic techniques. Treatment with
   colchicine, diethylstilbestrol, and vincristine sulfate resulted in high
   frequencies of primarily hyperdiploid nuclei, and cells exposed to
   radiation, mitomycin C, and etoposide exhibited elevated frequencies of
   breakage affecting the 1cen-1q12 region. Sodium arsenite and
   hydroquinone induced relatively minor but significant increases in both
   hyperdiploidy and breakage. These results indicate that this tandem
   labeling approach can be used to distinguish aneuploidy-inducing agents
   from those causing breakage in interphase human cells and may be a
   valuable procedure for monitoring human populations exposed to genotoxic
   agents. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The International Joint Commission (IJC) has identified
   polychlorinatedbiphenyls (PCBs) and mercury as the major chemical
   contaminants in the St. Lawrence River system. Since 1979, PCBs have
   been repeatedly identified in sediment, forage, sport fish, water fowl,
   snapping turtles and native mussels at various locations in the St.
   Lawrence River from Cornwall, Ontario to Valleyfield, Quebec. PCB
   concentrations in the river have rarely been below 1 ng/L, the Ontario
   Water Quality Objective. Since 1988, mercury levels in the
   Cornwall-Massena area of the St. Lawrence River have been found to be
   below the analytical detection limit of 10 ng/L. However, there are no
   systematic population monitoring of the health effects of the
   contaminants in the St. Lawrence river. One way of assessing the impact
   is through the National Vital Statistics on mortality and hospital
   morbidity. This paper discusses the limitations of such conventional
   epidemiologic studies in assessing the impact of environmental chemical
   contaminants on population health.}},

   using biomarkers provides measurable information on the intensity of

   very early health effects produced by environmental carcinogens and to

   health risk in humans exposed to carcinogens and, because determinations
   are performed directly in human organism, uncertainties inherent in

Abstract = {{Increasing population in the Illawarra coastal region, some 100 km south
   of Sydney, is leading to the transformation of large areas from rural
   dairying to urban residential land use. To allow proper planning
   guidelines to be put into place, a selected catchment, Cooback Creek, is
   being monitored before, during, and after urban development. Continuous
   recording of stream turbidity is being supplemented by stage sampling of
   water from the stream. The stage samples are analysed for a full range
   of water quality parameters. This paper describes the initial phases of
   the project and provides details of the catchment and instrumentation
   installed. Preliminary water quality analyses are also presented.}},

Title = {{Organotin concentrations in three intertidal neogastropods from the
   coastal waters of Taiwan}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},

Pages = {{113-118}},
Abstract = {{This study was aimed to determine organotin concentrations in the
   muricids Thais clavigera, Thais tuberosa and Morula granulata on an
   island wide scale and to find an adequate bioindicator species for
   long-term monitoring purpose. Samples were collected from the coast of
   Taiwan and vicinity islands with organotin analysis by graphite furnace
   atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Because triphenyltin (TPT) could
   not be discriminated from tributyltin (TBT) by the extraction method,
   organotins were measured as TBT+TPT and total hexane extractable
   organotins. Severity of imposer in the muricid population samples
   expressed as relative penis size (RPS) indices were calculated and
   compared to determine a suitable bioindicator species. In T. clavigera,
   T. tuberosa and M. granulata, TBT+TPT were 17-157, 1-44 and 117-1343 ng
   Sn g(-1) dry wt, respectively. And total organotins varied in the range
   of 181 to 1125, 23 to 44 and 229 to 1402 ng Sn g(-1) dry wt,
   respectively. A positive correlation was found between TBT+TPT and total
   organotins in M. granulata (TBT+TPT = Total organotins x 1.01-110.79;
   R-2 = 0.97; p < 0.001). At the site of Dapaisha, total organotins in M.
   granulata was 10 times higher than in T. tuberosa (i.e. 242 versus 23 ng
   Sn g(-1) dry wt). No signs of imposer were found in T. tuberosa (a
   single site in two subsequent years) and in M. granulata (seven
   collection sites). The degree of imposer (RPS) of T. clavigera varied
   from 0.2 to 38.1\%. The RPS indices from fishing harbors were not higher
   than from rocky shores and oyster culture sites. No correlation was
   found between RPS indices and concentrations of TBT + TPT or total
   organotins. M. granulata seemed to be insensitive to organotin pollution
   although organotins were also detected Our results indicate that
   organotin pollution is wide spread in coastal waters of Taiwan and
   pollutants at least include butyltins and phenyltins. As a bioindicator
   species, T. clavigera is more appropriate than T. tuberosa and M.
   granulata to monitor organotin contamination. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Concentrations of airborne lead at Springfield, Missouri, in 1975-1993
   have been determined by analysis of particulate material collected on
   glass-fiber filters during the 19-year period. Nitric acid-soluble lend
   in 1100 samples collected at a total of 19 monitoring stations was
   determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and by differential pulse
   polarography. Ambient concentrations of airborne lead were found to
   decrease steadily (by more than 90\%) during this period in spite of
   increases in area population and in automobile traffic. The decrease Is
   significantly correlated with national trends in total emissions of lead
   to the atmosphere and with US ambient lead levels. Airborne lead from a
   coal-fired power plant was small compared with that from gasoline
   burning. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The negative effects of chemical contaminants on tropical marine
   ecosystems are of increasing concern as human populations expand
   adjacent to these communities. Watershed streams and ground water carry
   a variety of chemicals from agricultural, industrial, and domestic
   activities, while winds and currents transport pollutants from
   atmospheric and oceanic sources to these coastal ecosystems. The
   implications of the limited information available on impacts of chemical
   stressors on mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs are
   discussed in the context of ecosystem management and ecological risk
   assessment. Three classes of pollutants have received attention: heavy
   metals, petroleum, and synthetic organics such as herbicides and
   pesticides. Heavy metals have been detected in all three ecosystems,
   causing physiological stress, reduced reproductive success, and outright
   mortality in associated invertebrates and fishes. Oil spills have been
   responsible for the destruction of entire coastal shallow-water
   communities, with recovery requiring years. Herbicides are particularly
   detrimental to mangroves and seagrasses and adversely affect the
   animal-algal symbioses in corals. Pesticides interfere with chemical
   cues responsible for key biological processes, including reproduction
   and recruitment of a variety of organisms. Information is lacking with
   regard to long-term recovery, indicator species, and biomarkers for
   tropical communities. Critical areas that are beginning to be addressed
   include the development of appropriate benchmarks for risk assessment,
   baseline monitoring criteria, and effective management strategies to
   protect tropical marine ecosystems in the face of mounting anthropogenic
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment contamination in the Caribbean has not been extensively
   studied. This review article outlines known cases of sediment
   contamination in the Caribbean and their impacts on Caribbean
   ecosystems. It also discusses regulation and remediation of contaminated
   sediments in the Caribbean and speculates on what the future holds
   regarding sediment toxicity. Existing information suggests that sediment
   contamination may be widespread, although not severe in most areas.
   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands contain two National Priority
   List sites and one candidate site under U.S. Superfund jurisdiction.
   These territories will be more extensively studied under the U.S.
   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program. Regulation of sediment
   contamination is difficult within the Caribbean region because
   jurisdiction is shared by 27 independent countries and a number of
   territories and dependencies. In addition to establishing control of
   natural resources within a 200-mile offshore limit for each Caribbean
   nation, the recently created Exclusive Economic Zone contains provisions
   for environmental protection and management, but many governments in the
   region lack the resources to implement them. The Caribbean Action Plan
   formalizes international cooperation and assistance to overcome some of
   these limitations. Many Caribbean countries have experienced a strong
   industrial expansion and a rapid population growth during the last 30 to
   40 years, and there is potential for further contamination as these
   islands develop.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site was established in
   southeastern Washington to produce plutonium during World War II. The
   Pantex Plant in the Texas Panhandle was originally used for loading
   conventional ammunition shells and bombs, but was rehabilitated and
   enhanced in the 1950s to assemble nuclear weapons. Environmental
   monitoring has been ongoing at both locations for several decades.
   Monitoring objectives are to detect and assess potential impacts of
   facility operations on air, surface and ground waters, foodstuffs, fish,
   wildlife, soils, and vegetation. Measured concentrations of airborne
   radionuclides around the perimeters of both sites are currently below
   applicable guidelines. Concentrations of radionuclides and
   nonradiological water quality in the Columbia River at Hanford, and
   radiological and nonradiological water quality in the Ogallala Aquifer
   beneath the Pantex Plant are in compliance with applicable standards.
   Foodstuffs irrigated with river water downstream from the Hanford Site
   show levels of radionuclides that are similar to those found in
   foodstuffs from control areas. The low levels of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in
   some onsite Hanford wildlife samples and concentrations of radionuclides
   in soils and vegetation from onsite and offsite at both locations are
   typical of those attributable to naturally occurring radioactivity and
   to worldwide fallout. The calculated dose potentially received by a
   maximally exposed individual (i.e., based on hypothetical, worst-case
   assumptions for all routes of exposure) at both sites in 1994 was less
   than or equal to 0.05 mrem. Ironically, by virtue of its size (1,450
   km(2) {[}560 mi(2)]), restricted public access, and conservative use of
   undeveloped land, the Hanford Site has provided a sanctuary for plant
   and animal populations that have been eliminated from, or greatly
   reduced on, surrounding agricultural and range lands. Ongoing studies
   will determine if this is also true at Pantex Plant.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, utilisation of African cultivated rice, Oryza glaberrima,
   in O. sativa breeding was hampered by high sterility in interspecific
   F-1 and in early progenies. Recent development of mapped molecular
   markers provides the opportunity to rationalise and to monitor
   introgressions between the two cultivated rice species. Development of
   such introgressed lines through interspecific hybridisation and
   backcrossing represents high potential to create new genetic and
   transgressive variation. We are initiating an original marker-aided
   backcross program with the aim of producing a set of 100 `contig lines',
   each one bearing an alien O. glaberrima chromosomal fragment of around
   20 cM in the O. sativa genetic background. As a preliminary step, we are
   now developing a genetic linkage map based on STS and RAPD markers,
   using an interspecific backcross between O. sativa and O. glaberrima.
   BC1 plants will then be selected to expedite the production of `contig
   lines' exhibiting only the target fragment. The interspecific
   polymorphism is anticipated to be large enough to make this methodology
   feasible. Many advantages are expected from this approach, such as: (i)
   systematic assessment of the useful genetic resources displayed by O.
   glaberrima, (ii) improved and simplified detection of QTLs and (iii)
   comparative analysis of genomic organisation of O. glaberrima vs. O.
   sativa. Current work on evaluation of STS and RAPD polymorphism between
   parents and development of the BC1 population is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the commercial approval of twenty-five transgenic crops in the
   U.S. as of mid-1996, concern is still being expressed regarding the
   potential risks associated with genetically engineered crops. One
   recurring issue is the possibility of pollen-mediated escape of
   engineered genes into populations of crop wild relatives. To address
   this concern, the scientific community has depended on literature on
   pollen dispersal generated from non-transgenic organisms. Utilization of
   this information requires the assumption that the pollen mediated
   movement of native and transgenes is the same. To test the validity of
   this assumption, we directly compared the pollen-mediated gene movement
   of native and engineered marker genes using melon plants (Cucumis melo
   L.) expressing dominant morphological and transgenic traits. Movement
   into both contiguous border plots and non-contiguous satellite plots
   were monitored. Dispersal of the native gene and transgene into the
   satellite plots was identical. Dispersal of the two traits into the plot
   borders was nearly identical. Of the nearly 4600 seedlings screened for
   both morphological (presence of green vs. virescent cotyledons) and
   transgene movement (presence of NPT II protein by ELISA), in no case was
   the NPT II gene observed in the absence of green cotyledons. However, 39
   seedlings were green but did not express NPT II as measured by ELISA.
   PCR analysis revealed transgene inactivation as a cause of the NPT II
   ELISA(-) seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{Visual and olfactory responses of onion maggot flies (OMF), Delia
   antiqua (Meigen), to food and oviposition resources in relation to sex,
   ovarian development, and time of day, were evaluated in a commercial
   onion field in Cloverdale, British Columbia, using horizontal coloured
   sticky traps baited with the oviposition attractant dipropyl-disulphide
   (DPDS) or feeding attractant, enzymatic yeast hydrolysate (EYH). White
   and blue were among the most attractive colours to both males and
   females, but the sex ratio was strongly male-biased (2.7 : 1). Both
   olfactory baits increased catches of male OMF on all coloured traps to
   the same extent but neither bait affected the attractiveness ranking of
   colours. EYH significantly increased female catches on all coloured
   traps, whereas DPDS only significantly increased response to white
   traps. The joint action of visual and olfactory stimuli appeared
   additive in both sexes, not synergistic. DPDS significantly increased
   catches of mature, gravid females, whereas EYH increased catches of
   immature females and unbaited traps caught equal proportions of immature
   and mature flies. The addition of DPDS to white sticky traps could
   improve monitoring programmes for OMF by attracting more ovipositing
   females, especially at low populations levels. Census of trap catches
   every 2 h established a minor flight peak between 10.00 and 12.00 h,
   primarily in response to food baits, and a major early evening peak
   (18.00-20.00 h) in response to DPDS. Daily activity patterns of males
   and females were not significantly different and activity patterns were
   independent of trap colour. Response to DPDS was low throughout the
   morning and only started to increase in late afternoon, which is
   correlated with oviposition patterns observed in laboratory studies. A
   general crepuscular behaviour and high early evening activity supports
   the view that where insecticide sprays are still used effectively, these
   should be applied in early evening.}},

Abstract = {{The Prespa nase, Chondrostoma prespensis, lives exclusively in Lakes
   Mikri and Megali Prespa in north-western Greece. The Prespa nase fishery
   catches in both lakes began declining in the early 1980s, probably due
   to overfishing. However, the population of Lake Mikri Prespa, which has
   been monitored from 1984 to 1996, has shown an increase since the early
   1990s thanks to the use of larger mesh size and a decrease in the
   fishing effort of the fishery. The population of Lake Mikri Prespa seems
   unique for the genus because it lives in a lentic ecosystem which is
   lacking any permanent inflow streams, the Prespa nase being therefore
   forced to spawn within the lake. In contrast, the population of Lake
   Megali Prespa do undertake spawning migration into permanent inflows.
   This migration was studied in 1995 and 1996 in the Agios Germanos
   stream, starting late April to late May. Only large mature fish visit
   and spawn in this stream, the migration taking place exclusively at
   night. Migrating at night may protect them from diurnal predation from
   waterbirds.}},

Abstract = {{The species of bugs harmful to hazelnuts were sampled weekly in three
   groves of the Langhe region in Piemonte (northwestern Italy) from May to
   August 1995. During each sampling half of the canopy of six plants was
   beaten and the fallen biological material was collected and examined in
   the laboratory. Seven bug species were found, of which Gonocerus
   acuteangulatus and Palomena prasina were the most abundant. Population
   dynamics of these bugs were checked on hazelnut plants. Independently of
   the control method, the pests had a different localization in the
   investigated area: 95.90\% of G. acuteangulatus specimens were sampled
   in one of the groves, 75.44\% of P. prasina ones were collected in
   another. From 11 July to 29 August the hazelnuts dropping during
   samplings were weighed and 10\% of them were observed and classified in
   symptomless, spotted, browned, belted, and full or aborted. At
   harvest-time hazelnut samples were monitored in the field and in the
   warehouse to ascertain the damages. Injuries caused by the bug feeding
   activity were always lower than 1\% in the grove where G. acuteangulatus
   and P. prasina were scarce, whereas they were very variable and higher
   than 3\% in the other two groves.}},

   under-represented, several river specialist species are not effectively
   monitored.
   3. The River Habitat Survey measures the physical features of rivers,

Abstract = {{The root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans is a severe pathogen of
   raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) and other small fruit crops. Temporal
   changes in the size and distribution between root and soil habitats of a
   population of dhe nematode under raspberry were monitored. Soil and root
   samples were collected at four depths from five plots in an 8-year-old
   raspberry planting every 2 weeks for 2 years. Trends of nematode
   densities were not identical in the 2 years. There were no sustained
   changes in the fall and winter of the first year, a reduction in
   nematode population in the first spring followed by increases in early
   summer and early fail followed by a decrease in late fall. There were no
   sustained changes in the second year except fur a single reduction in
   late spring and summer. The proportion of the nematode population in
   roots ranged from a maximum of 0.69 to a minimum of 0.07, but that
   proportion did not follow a seasonal pattern. Nematode densities were
   not correlated with root abundance. Because of the lack of regular
   seasonal population trends, it is suggested thai parameters other than
   temperature and root availability may have controlled reproduction of
   the nematodes, and distribution between roots and rhizosphere soil of
   perennial crops.}},

Abstract = {{The intensive exploitation, since the beginning of the century, of a
   semiconfined aquifer in Buenos Aires City (Argentina) and its
   surrounding areas has caused large drawdown cones by the coalescence of
   smaller ones. The population of the area is about 11 million
   inhabitants, The climate is subhumid-humid with a mean annual rainfall
   of 1050 mm/year and a surplus of 270 mm/year. Some of the effects caused
   by the intensive exploitation have been saline intrusion and leakage
   from the phreatic aquifer through the aquitard, which caused a fall of
   the water table. As a consequence of the demand increase and closing of
   production wells due to salinization and nitrate content, treated water
   from the La Plata River began to be imported. The recovery of
   piezometric levels has caused the phreatic levels to rise, with a
   serious impact on the urban infrastructure, established some decades
   ago. Based on successive now-nets, on the system parameters T,S,K,K',T'
   and on the value of imported yields, a monitoring system with forecast
   capacity is proposed, as well as an operative model for phenomena
   control, using alternative pumping on both aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter discusses the events that led to the contamination of
   environments with the long-lived radionuclides of caesium, strontium and
   other elements,;md to the internal exposure of populations living in
   contaminated areas. Among these events are radioactive releases into the
   river Techa from the Soviet nuclear weapons facility Mayak in 1940-1956,
   thermonuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s, the Kyshtim and
   Windscale accidents in 1957, and the Chernobyl and Tomsk-7 accidents in
   1986 and 1993, respectively. Methods of environmental monitoring and
   individual internal dose monitoring of inhabitants are described. These
   are based-on measuring the content of radionuclides not only in the air,
   drinking water and local food products, but also in humans using
   whole-body counters and analysing excreta and autopsy samples. The
   dynamics of internal exposure of people of different ages to
   radionuclides of caesium, strontium and plutonium from the environment
   are considered. Examples of radionuclide distributions in the
   environment, and of individual/collective internal doses and related
   medical effects are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic bioremediation of dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons in two
   impacted water bearing zones was evaluated by documenting: 1) loss of
   contaminants at the field scale; 2) biochemical evidence of petroleum
   hydrocarbon degradation, and 3) microbial populations. Spatial and
   temporal changes in dissolved petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations
   documented during an ongoing quarterly monitoring program suggest the
   plume is shrinking in the first-encountered water bearing zone (A-zone)
   and stable in the second-encountered water bearing zone (B-zone).
   Spatial distribution of biochemical indicator parameters indicate a
   combination of aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation processes are
   occurring at the site. Microbial population data indicate indigenous
   microbial populations are sufficient for petroleum hydrocarbon
   biodegradation.
   Biodegradation processes in the A-zone include aerobic respiration along
   the margins of the dissolved petroleum hydrocarbon plume and anaerobic
   processes of denitrification, iron reduction, sulfanogenesis, and
   methanogenesis within the plume interior. Denitrification occurs in the
   central and southern parts of the site, within and downgradient of
   source areas. Iron reduction and methanogenesis appear to be laterally
   widespread processes occurring within and downgradient of the source
   areas. Sulfanogenesis generally occurs in the source areas. Calculations
   suggest the A-zone has the capacity to assimilate approximately 4 times
   the total BTEX detected during a concurrent groundwater monitoring
   event.
   Anaerobic biodegradation processes of denitrification, iron reduction,
   sulfanogenesis, and methanogenesis occur within the second water bearing
   zone (B-zone). Transitions between regions of denitrification,
   sulfanogensis, and iron reduction are observed downgradient of the
   source areas. Methanogenesis occurs within and downgradient of source
   areas. The calculated B-zone assimilative capacity is an order of
   magnitude greater than the total BTEX detected during a concurrent
   groundwater monitoring event.}},

   was selected to strip dissolved benzene, volatilize the non-dissolved
   benzene source material, and provide dissolved oxygen for increasing
   aerobic bacteria populations. Indigenous bacteria populations were
   stimulated with ammonium phosphate injections. Groundwater pumping was
   used to manipulate subsurface air flow, nutrient transport, and biomass
   management. After approximately six months of operation and a two-month
   rebound monitoring period, benzene concentration reductions of greater
   than 80 percent were experienced.}},

Abstract = {{In September 1994, in Nothern Italy, the rupturing of a pipeline led to
   the spilling of roughly 200 cubic meters of paraffinic crude oil,
   flooding an area characterized by a critical vegetation growth of prized
   cultivations. This area has an extension of 4000 sq m and is located
   near a river.
   The product infiltrated in the soil reaching the nearby aquifer whose
   depth fluctuated between 1.5 and 4.5 meters. The contaminated zone was
   initially reclaimed through the installation of a Soil Vapor Extraction
   (SVE) and Air Sparging system (AS) made up of vertical extraction wells
   and horizontal trenches. A Pump and Treat system allowed the recovery of
   the dissolved phase, together with a Microbial Fence which prevented the
   diffusion of the contaminants in the downstream portion of the hot spot.
   After six months of treatment, the concentration of BTEX and other
   volatile hydrocarbons diminished by 99\%; thus the soil vapor extraction
   was interrupted, and In-Situ Bioremediation was initiated. In reference
   to previously achieved results during four months of laboratory testing
   of soil samples (performed by Eniricherche S.p.A.), an authocthonous
   microbial population was selected. The abatement of the concentration of
   hydrocarbons still present in the soil has been favored by the use of
   nutrients whose concentration in the groundwater has been constantly
   monitored.}},

   (i)nutrient amendments; (ii)nutrient amendments and a sufactant;
   (iii)nutrient amendments, a surfactant and hydrogen peroxide; and
   (iv)nutrient amendments, a surfactant and air venting. Bioremediation
   progress was monitored within three depth horizons (0-3 `', 3-24 `', and
   24-48 `') utilizing: EPA 418.1 (TRPH); EPA Modified 8015 (TPH: <C-10,

Abstract = {{Determining in situ rates of biodegradation of organic contaminants in
   submerged marine sediments remains a significant challenge to the
   assessment of site remediation strategies. This paper summarizes the
   results of experimental measurements of contaminant mineralization rates
   by natural microbial populations in the upper 10 cm of sediments at
   several sites in Puget Sound, WA. These waterways are currently in being
   treated or in the design phase as Superfund Sites. Recalcitrant (slowly
   degraded) organic contaminants under investigation are bis(2-ethylhexyl)
   phthalate (BEP) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and several other polyaromatic
   hydrocarbons(PAHs). To the authors' knowledge, no site-specific rate
   data are available for the biodegradation of these compounds in Puget
   Sound sediments. What little information is available from other marine
   environments suggests that the rates are extremely slow. We have
   therefore used a sensitive radioactive isotope method to be able to
   monitor the evolution of CO2 from the mineralization of the radiolabeled
   compounds in a reasonable period of time, with killed controls to
   distinguish abiotic losses from the microbial action of interest.
   Labeled compounds were added in tracer amounts to replicate samples of
   agitated sediment-seawater slurries and also injected into undisturbed
   sediment subcores. Owing to dilution and agitation, oxygen and other
   nutrients were more available to the bacteria in slurries than under the
   more nearly in situ conditions simulated in the injected subcores. Thus,
   the slurry method provided maximum estimates of biodegradation rates,
   while the injection core method provided minimum rates. An ability to
   set bounds on the biodegradation rates should improve the design process
   for pollution cleanup or containment strategies. The relationship
   between these site-specific in situ biodegradation rates and capping of
   contaminated marine sediments is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The biodegradation of Iranian Light crude oil is examined in beach
   sediments of the Saronikos Gulf, Greece. Two oleophilic fertilizers
   (Inipol and Fl) were applied at two concentrations (high, low) on beach
   sediments. The fertilizer treatments were combined with indigenous and
   introduced bacteria populations (DB 19). Control treatments received no
   fertilizer or introduced bacteria. Biodegradation was assessed by GC
   monitoring of the n-C-17/pristane and n-C-18/phytane ratios on days 0,
   1, 3, 7, 15 and 30 after the addition of crude oil to the sediments.
   Regardless of bacterial treatment, additions of high concentrations of
   Fl (modified fishmeal) resulted in significant hydrocarbon degradation:
   On day 30, the n-C-18/phytane ratio of the high Fl application was
   significantly lower than all other treatment combinations on any day of
   the experiment. Although Inipol application had less dramatic effects on
   the n-C-18/phytane ratio, on day 30, the Inipol-assigned beach sediments
   were the least contaminated at visual inspection.
   Inoculation with bacteria did not affect bioremediation significantly
   throughout the trials. On days 15 and 30, treatments receiving
   fertilizers and inoculated with bacteria showed a gradual reduction in
   the n-C-17/pristane ratio (1.90 vs. 2.20 on day 1).}},

Abstract = {{Low-cost laboratory treatability testing was performed to evaluate the
   effectiveness of bioventing on gasoline and waste-oil impacted sandy
   soils. High CO2 (16\%) and low O-2 (1\%) soil vapor concentrations
   suggested biological respiration and prompted the collection of soil
   samples for laboratory testing. Positive enumeration results led to
   performing a 30-day laboratory bioventing test for the design of a
   full-scale bioventing system. The treatability test microbial
   populations increased two-orders of magnitude and reduced the total
   hydrocarbon concentrations from 1,700 mg/Kg to non-detect. Based on
   these results, a full-scale bioventing system was designed and operated.
   A vadose zone soil vapor and neutron logging program was established to
   monitor remediation progress. Site closure was achieved after 17 months
   of operation.}},

Abstract = {{A time release oxygen compound was placed into an aquifer to facilitate
   bioremediation of a BTEX plume at a leaking underground storage tank
   site. The objective was to accelerate naturally occurring biodegradation
   by using an oxygen release compound(R) (ORC), which slowly delivers
   oxygen over an extended period of time. The treatment area was estimated
   to be approximately 36 m by 21 m, with a 3 m thick contaminated
   saturated zone containing approximately 13.4 kg of BTEX (benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes). ORC was applied by drilling 50
   borings with 10.8 cm inner diameter (ID) hollow stem augers and
   installing a precast 10.2 cm diameter cylinder of the compound into the
   upper three meters of the aquifer. BTEX concentrations and microbial
   populations were measured from a series of five monitoring wells in the
   impacted area. The mass of the BTEX compounds totaled approximately 13.4
   kg before ORC installation. In the 316 days following the installation
   of ORC, the contaminant mass has been reduced to 6.2 kg. This decrease
   in contaminant mass is faster than would be expected by natural
   attenuation. Analytical results indicate that there has been a four to
   170 fold increase in microbial populations in the monitoring wells.}},

Abstract = {{Dendroctonus frontalis (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) is native to
   southeastern, USA, pine forests and has a rich complex of insect
   parasitoids. Natural enemies, and especially parasitoids, do not
   currently appear effective in regulating D. frontalis populations within
   rapidly expanding infestations. We believe forest stand structure,
   coupled with improper forest management strategies, are the primary
   reasons for this apparent lack of regulation.
   We monitored D. frontalis and parasitoid populations over an 18-month
   period in a large infestation in east Texas and noted that although
   parasitoid numbers tracked D. frontalis population growth and decline,
   percent parasitism never exceeded 10\% and averaged 5 to 6\%. Why were
   parasitoids not able to better respond to increasing D. frontalis host
   populations? Our data suggest that both longevity and fecundity of
   parasitoid adults are severely constrained when food is not available.
   Our research with a synthetic food, Eliminade(TM), developed by Entopath
   Inc., substantiates our hypothesis that longevity and egg production of
   adult D. frontalis parasitoids is increased when they are fed a
   nutrient-rich diet. We are currently testing field applications of this
   diet as an applied biological control tactic for southern pine beetle.}},

Abstract = {{Availability of defenceless or weakly defended breeding material, e.g.
   trees felled or damaged by major wind storms, is a necessary requirement
   for an outbreak of the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus. Water stress
   is also hypothesised to be an important predisposing factor, although
   this idea is mostly based on circumstantial observation of a coincidence
   between dry weather and beetle outbreaks. Whereas a causal relationship
   may well exist for certain scolytid beetles, experimental evidence is
   often scarce and in some cases contradictory. We examine information
   pertaining to population dynamics of the spruce bark beetle Ips
   typographus in Norway. This includes (1) experiments to assess effect of
   drought stress on host tree susceptibility to the beetle's pathogenic
   fungal associate, Ceratocystis polonica, and (2) results from a
   population monitoring program which has been in operation since 1980.
   Because drought often coincides with hot weather, one can confuse a
   direct effect on beetle propagation by hot weather with an indirect
   effect on insect dynamics through predisposition of the host trees. We
   conclude that apart from extremely rare cases of severe droughts lasting
   for a long period of time, direct effects of spring weather on beetle
   propagation are more likely to affect I. typographus dynamics than are
   indirect physiological effects working through the host trees.}},

Abstract = {{Population abundance and species composition of rice green leafhoppers
   was monitored by sweepnet sampling or light trapping from more than 116
   rice growing locations in different altitudinal regions of Nepal from
   1992 to 1994. Three species of leafhopper Nephotettix virescens, N.
   nigropictus and Recilia dorsalis, were found in most samples, and a few
   leafhoppers similar to N. malayanus were occasionally observed. N.
   virescens was predominant (80\%) in samples from low altitude rice
   fields (<500 m), and its population in high altitude rice fields (>1000
   m) was negligible or absent. N. nigropictus, in contrast, was more
   widely distributed in rice fields at both low and high altitude, and
   predominated (95\%) in high altitude rice fields (>1000 m). The light
   trap data from rice fields at low altitude (250 m) showed that both N.
   virescens and N. nigropictus were caught throughout the year, with few
   or none caught during winter (December-February). The abundance of these
   two insects increased from April-May with a small peak in early July and
   a larger peak during September-October. In 1992-1994 the highest numbers
   of insects were recorded during mid to the late October. In the field
   samples, leafhopper abundance varied depending upon the sampling year
   and location. The numbers were higher during 1993 than either 1992 or
   1994. Abundance varied among locations and there was a significant
   relationship between the abundance and physiographic variables.
   Abundance of N. virescens was negatively related to altitude and total
   annual rainy days, while abundance of N. nigropictus was positively
   related. For the light trap data, there was a significant correlation
   between leafhopper abundance and minimum temperature. Our results are
   discussed in relationship to leafhopper ecology and their implications
   for management.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this investigation was to estimate inbreeding depression
   and self-fertilization depression from a comparison of self-fertilizing
   and outcrossing pulmonate snails, Physa heterostropha. We monitored
   lifetime survival and fecundity in 26 paired snails from three isofemale
   lines, using recessive alleles at two complementing albino loci to
   verify outcrossing. While demonstrably holding allosperm reserves, 10 of
   these individuals bore self-fertilized progeny at frequencies ranging
   from 1\% to 35\%. We designated these 10 individuals `'mixed maters,''
   leaving 16 individuals in our sample as more strictly outcrossers. Mixed
   maters and outcrossers produced comparable numbers of viable embryos per
   parent, and their embryos displayed negligible differences in survival
   to 7-14 days post-hatch. Outcrossing and mixed groups displayed nearly
   identical values for net reproductive rate (808 and 848
   offspring/parent, respectively) and intrinsic rate of natural increase
   (2.86 and 2.82 per four weeks). Thus in the benign environment of
   artificial culture, the low levels of self-fertilization occasionally
   displayed by the previously inseminated snails seem adaptively neutral.
   The fitness of both the outcrossers and mixed maters greatly exceeded
   that of 15 individuals isolated as juveniles and hence forced to
   self-fertilize entirely (R=286, r=1.57). There were no significant
   differences among selfers, outcrossers, and mixed-maters with respect to
   parental survival. But selfing parents produced fewer eggs over their
   lifetimes, higher proportions of apparently infertile eggs, and embryos
   of much-reduced survival. The estimated inbreeding depression of 0.353,
   together with an overall self-fertilization depression of 0.646,
   suggests strong selective pressure against self-fertilization, and
   evolution toward at least partial outcrossing.}},

Abstract = {{The methods used to assess a red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris
   reintroduction experiment at Parco Groane, northern Italy, are
   described. Population size at the removal site was estimated (c. 2400
   squirrels) using drey counts, to evaluate the effect of removing animals
   for reintroduction. suitability of the release site was investigated in
   two ways: (1) beforehand, by comparing tree seed abundance with that at
   the removal site, (2) retrospectively, by comparing drey-site choice
   between removal and release site. Increase and dispersion of the
   reintroduced population were monitored using drey counts and searching
   for species-specific feeding signs. Although only eight squirrels could
   be released (four males, four females), the experiment was successful
   and by 1996 all wooded habitats at Parco Groane were inhabited by
   squirrels.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of eight radiotagged red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris
   Linnaeus, 1758) reintroduced at Parco Groane, northern Italy, was
   monitored for two months following their release. Both male and female
   squirrels moved over considerable distances the first two weeks after
   introduction, exploring the new habitat. Two types of exploring
   behaviour were observed: (i) gradually expanding the home range, moving
   only short distances each day; and (ii) making regular excursions of
   more than 1 km followed by short periods of activity in a small area.
   The latter behaviour resulted in very large home ranges during the
   exploring phase. After the initial exploring, home range size decreased
   and one male and two female squirrels changed their space use by
   increasing the number of activity centres (core-areas) within their home
   range. Post-settlement home ranges were spaced out over the available
   habitat and all squirrels used almost completely exclusive core-areas.
   Only four red squirrels (two males and two females) survived long enough
   to be the potential founders of the new population that established
   itself at Parco Groane. We discuss methods to decrease post-release
   mortality in red squirrels and consider generic and demographic
   consequences of squirrel reintroductions.}},

Abstract = {{Seven foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were studied by radio-tracking from 3 to 12
   months/animal, and a total of 4 005 fixes was made. Seasonal home ranges
   were calculated using several methods giving a minimum of 29.3 and a
   maximum of 268.7 ha (100\% Minimum Convex Polygon). The land use by the
   foxes was monitored and the habitat analysed. No uniform home range use
   was revealed, but several core areas were identified; 1-3 of rest and
   1-4 of activity being found, seasonally, in each home range. The
   distribution of core areas of rest and activity suggested that home
   range size and shape were determined not only by core areas of activity
   but also by resting sites. The Kernel centres of rest were localised
   mainly in natural vegetation (85.1\%) and sometimes in cereal fields
   (12.1\%) or in hay-lofts (2.8\%), while those of activity were in
   anthropic environments (56.1\%) as well as in natural vegetation
   (43.9\%), but with seasonal variations. Activity was mainly nocturnal,
   but interrupted by resting periods. Some individual variations were also
   revealed in home range size, number of core areas, habitat use and daily
   activity.}},

   and second-generation soybean looper had LD(50)s (95\% confidence limits
   {[}CL] expressed as micrograms of insecticide per larva) of 0.0028
   (0.0018-0.0040) and 0.0096 (0.0050-0.0154), respectively, which were
   significantly higher than the LD(50) (CL) of the susceptible laboratory
   strain (0.0002 {[}0.0001-0.0003]). Resistance level in the second
   generation was 3.4-fold higher than that in the first generation.
   Similar data were obtained by Portillo et al. (1993) in recording 3.3-
   and 2.2-fold higher soybean looper resistance levels in
   second-generation than in first-generation soybean looper in 1989 and
   1991, respectively. These data corroborate earlier reports that levels
   of soybean looper resistance to pyrethroid insecticides significantly
   increased in cotton-soybean production areas as the crop growing season
   progressed. It appears that mid-season pyrethroid insecticide
   applications on cotton increase selection pressure for pyrethroid
   resistance in soybean looper populations in cotton-soybean
   agroecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The Dietary Exposure Potential Model (DEPM) is a computer-based model
   developed for estimating dietary exposure to chemical residues in food.
   The DEPM is based on food consumption data from the 1987-1988 Nationwide
   Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) administered by the United States
   Department of Agriculture (USDA) and on residue data from
   government-sponsored monitoring programs. Foods reported in the NFCS
   were categorized into exposure core foods (ECFs). A computer program for
   DOS-based personal computers was developed to link consumption of the
   ECFs with residue values observed in the foods. The data files utilized
   by the DEPM were designed in dBASE IV(TM) With FoxPro(R) for Windows(TM)
   applications programs for queries and reporting. The program calculates
   exposure estimates for categories of core foods, such as grain dishes,
   fruits, or vegetables; for individual core foods, such as wheat and
   apple combination dishes; and for individual foods, such as apples or
   carrots. The program, residue summary databases, and core food
   consumption database permit the analyst to evaluate potential exposure
   of several population groups to various chemicals via the diet. The DEPM
   is nor intended for risk assessments, but is a suitable tool for
   identifying data gaps and establishing priorities for research, and for
   identifying potentially significant foods for human exposure monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of external lesions on Atlantic tomcod from the St Lawrence
   River was carried out between mid-December 1992 and the end of January
   1993 (n = 1674). Jaw ulcerations were observed in 3.8\% of the fish.
   These ulcers were usually single, and located at the junction between
   the skin epidermis and oral mucosa. They progressed from shallow lesions
   to deep ulcers with pathological fracture of the facial bone secondary
   to osteitis. The aetiology of these lesions could not be determined.
   Fish with ulcers were generally older than those of the monitored
   spawning population. The reason for a higher prevalence in older tomcods
   is unknown, but decreased immune functions and healing capacity caused
   by ageing are suggested as potential predisposing factors.}},

Abstract = {{Hexagenia populations, eradicated in the 1950s by anoxia, are recovering
   in the western basin of Lake Erie. Water from the Detroit River, which
   provides the largest contaminant loan into the lake, flows west-to-east
   through the center of the western basin. We hypothesized that body
   burdens of Hexagenia would reflect a gradient of decreasing
   contamination from west to east across the basin, and from the central
   axis toward shorelines. In summer 1994, we used light traps or mane use
   of lakeside dock lights to collect subimagos (females and males) and
   imagos (females)for 2 h pr sunset at three locations on the Detroit
   Rivet and at 22 locations throughout Lake Ei ie. Imagos were found
   throughout the western basin, but at only three locations in other areas
   of Lake Erie. Mayflies were analyzed for 59 organochlorine compounds
   including 42 congeners of PCBs by electron-capture detector gas
   chromatography. Results were analyzed using principal component analysis
   to reduce autocorrelations among contaminants. There was a I:I
   correspondence for PCB concentrations between subimago and imago stages,
   indicating no change in body burdens between moults. The highest
   contaminant burdens of adults at Monroe, Michigan (an Area of Concern)
   reflects local sources of contaminated sediments. There are high
   concentrations in mayfly body burdens at Middle Sister and East Sister
   islands and lower concentrations near both northern and southern
   shorelines of the basin. Hexagenia are confirmed as effective and
   efficient monitors of organochlorines.}},

Abstract = {{The responses of gypsy moth larvae originating from two populations (oak
   forest, locust forest) to favorable (oak) and unfavorable (locust) host
   plants were monitored at the level of midgut antioxidative defence: the
   activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione
   peroxidase like ('GSH-Px like') and glutathione content (GSH),
   Short-term change of the diet (3 days) to locust leaves of the 5th
   instar larvae (oak population) provoked an increase in GST and `GSH-Px
   like' activities as well as in the amount of GSH, On the contrary,
   transferring the gypsy moth larvae (locust population) to oak leaves was
   followed by a decrease in GST, `GSH-Px like' activities, and in the
   amount of GSH. Feeding gypsy moth larvae from hatching on an unfavorable
   host plant such as locust, led to increases in GST and SOD activities
   and GSH content, as well as to a decrease in CAT activity in all instars
   studied (4th, 5th, 6th), The locust leaf diet caused changes in other
   components of antioxidative defence dependent on larval instar and
   population origin, a feature which could be ascribed to trophic
   adaptation of the gypsy moth to an unfavorable host plant. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{We estimated densities of the endangered Lower Keys marsh rabbit
   (Sylvilagus palustris hefneri) at 5 habitat patches on Boca Chica Key,
   Monroe County, Florida, using pellet counting and direct enumeration
   from livetrapping. We compared density estimates from these 2 methods to
   an independent estimation of population size based on radiotracking data
   to determine which method would be best for long-term population
   monitoring. Density estimates were made 3 times per year for 2.5 years
   from March 1991 to July 1993. Significant correlations were found
   between pellet counting and radiotelemetry estimates (r(2) = 0.89, p <
   0.0001) and between the livetrapping and radiotelemetry estimates (r(2)
   = 0.99, p < 0.0001). Pellet-counting estimates took 80\% less time to
   perform than livetrapping estimates. Although livetrapping may have a
   higher correlation with actual population density, pellet counting
   provides an economic and efficient estimate that is well suited to
   long-term population monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Iskenderun city, situated in the East-Mediterranean region of Turkey,
   suffers from shortage of water as a consequence of rapid economic
   development and population increase. The two main water bearing
   lithologic formations in oskenderun province are the coastal alluvium
   and the extensively karstified carbonate rocks. Abuse of the karstic
   depressions and solution cavities as waste disposal sites threatens the
   karst aquifer seriously. The main sources of groundwater contamination
   in Iskenderun area were determined by monitoring the springs and wells
   and subsequently the protection areas were delineated by means of
   morphologic, hydrologic analyses, and tracing techniques. Apart from the
   technical side, educating the local authorities and the public about the
   role of karstic features in karst groundwater pollution is not less
   important task than the technical works in preventing pollution.
   Measures to be taken in this account are discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{High population density along the coastline creates problems related to
   the lack of reliable surface waters. The wide spread coastal aquifers
   are the main water resources to cover the demand in these areas. The
   coastal aquifers occur within highly karstified units and exhibit
   complex hydraulic systems. The carbonate aquifers are highly effected by
   sea water intrusion either by natural processes or mismanagement of
   groundwater resources. Therefore, determining the depth of fresh water -
   salt water interface toward the inland becomes major concern Temporal
   changes of the position of this interface control the amount of the
   groundwater that could be taken from these aquifers. In this paper the
   author discusses some of the typical sea water intrusion cases and
   geophysical methods applied to monitor and determine the expected saline
   water encroachment zone and its behaviour during groundwater
   exploitation of coastal karst aquifers in Turkey. The present sea water
   intrusion problems take place in most of the provinces which are located
   along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.}},

Abstract = {{Demosponges dominate the littoral zone of Lake Baikal, Russia. During
   August 1993, we measured the in situ pumping activity of a globose
   sponge, Baikalospongia bacillifera, common at depths of 8-50 m.
   Excurrent flow speed, surface area, and oscular diameter were measured
   with fluorescein dye release, underwater video, and image processing for
   nine individual sponges; diel deployments of a heated thermistor
   flowmeter were made on another three individuals. Mean pumping rates for
   oscula ranged from 0.2 to 3.3 cm s(-1), with instantaneous measurements
   as high as 25 cm s(-1). Although between-sponge variability is large,
   oscula from an individual maintain speeds within 1 cm s(-1) of each
   other. Volume fluxes for oscula measured from all individuals range from
   0.01 to 0.60 cm(-1) s(-1). Fluxes for individuals indicate that a sponge
   processes its volume in 17-24 s, comparable to values obtained for
   marine species. Oscula are not continuously active and often reduce
   pumping for several hours at irregular intervals. Two of three
   individuals monitored over a diel cycle exhibited negative correlations
   between the ambient current and oscular excurrent flow. Boundary layer
   measurements and diffusivity calculations demonstrate that sponges are
   capable of depleting picoplankton near the bottom.}},

Abstract = {{Trapping of fruit flies (Family Tephritidae) provides information on the
   species present in an area, is widely used for quarantine surveillance
   and is essential for monitoring populations during control or
   eradication programs or for ecological studies. In seven Pacific Island
   countries (Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji,
   Solomon Islands, Tonga Vanuatu and Western Samoa) under the Regional
   Fruit Fly Project and ACIAR Project, systematic trapping has been
   conducted as part of cataloguing of the species present and establishing
   early warning systems to record the incursions or introductions of
   exotic fruit fly species. Separate modified Steiner traps baited with
   methyl eugenol and Cue-lure were distributed in urban, village, farming
   and forest habitats in each country. The traps were serviced weekly in
   some areas of FSM, but generally every two weeks or monthly in most
   countries. Specimens were identified either nationally or by submitting
   them to the Queensland Department of Primary Industries. Australia. In
   some countries (Tonga, Fiji), trimedlure baited traps have been included
   in the early warning system.
   The responses to male lures of the known species in the seven countries
   are listed. Flies that do not respond to male lures are also identified.
   Though the trapping and host surveys seem comprehensive in these
   countries, there is still a large number of host surveys io be done in
   rainforest areas of Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea.}},

Abstract = {{Massive human presence in the Mediterranean and inadequate management of
   marine resources have recently become a threat to marine mammal survival
   in this region. The main problems facing cetaceans in the Mediterranean
   include: by-catch in fisheries competition with artisanal coastal
   gillnet fisheries, presence of noxious manmade, compounds in the trophic
   chains, and finally, a generalised degradation of environmental quality,
   particularly evident over the continental shelf, caused by loss of
   biodiversity, depletion of living resources, increased human
   disturbance, and changes in the physical and chemical properties of the
   environment. Conserving cetaceans in the Mediterranean is a modern
   challenge: appropriate management schemes and pollution control measures
   should enable marine mammals to coexist with intense human activities,
   and the Mediterranean could provide an excellent testing ground for such
   an enterprise. Recent developments in the field of marine bioacoustics
   could provide information highly relevant to the conservation of
   cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea: acoustic surveys can be performed to
   monitor the distribution and relative abundance pelagic species, and to
   investigate habitat partitioning of coastal species. Analysis of
   distinctive vocalisations can indicate the likelihood of links between
   Mediterranean an Atlantic populations. Finally, acoustics can play a
   major role in solving problems posed by interactions between cetacean
   and fisheries, in monitoring the effects of high-intensity acoustic
   deterrents, and to understand the possible negative effects of some
   manmade noise on cetacean populations.}},

Abstract = {{In a larger release project, European lobsters (Homarus gammarus) under
   legal size have been captured, checked for magnetic microtags,
   externally tagged, and released to their home site for population and
   migration studies. To see if transplanted lobsters behave differently
   from native lobsters, four acoustically tagged males were released
   between three stationary hydrophones in an open sea lagoon and tracked
   continuously for 2-3 weeks. Lobster 1 was from the lagoon, Lobster 2 was
   transplanted less than 1000 m from its capture location, and Lobsters 3
   and 4 were transplanted more than 5000 m. Within a few hours, Lobsters 1
   and 2 took up residence in the area of their original home sites.
   Lobsters 3 and 4 took up residence in the lagoon after extended roaming.
   Six days after release, Lobsters 1 and 4 engaged in nocturnal activity,
   Lobster 2 changed locations occasionally without moving long distances,
   and Lobster 3 did not move. The odd movement patterns in the
   transplanted lobsters could be caused by their lack of local knowledge.
   Since rocks caused blocking of the acoustic signals, manual monitoring
   was needed to confirm the lobster positions. In cryptic animals such as
   lobsters, a continuous tracking system that can penetrate stones is
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial exploitation of the Namibian Jasus lalandii stock started in
   the early 1920s. Catches were high until the mid 1960s, with annual
   landings of up to 9000 t. During 1968 and 1969 the minimum legal size
   limit was abolished, a collapse occurred in the stock, and annual
   catches declined to 1000-3000 t. During a 1988 warm-water event mass
   mortalities of lobsters were recorded, and catches continued to decline
   over the following three years. In 1992 the total allowable catch (TAC)
   was set at 100 t, and finally limited catches. Subsequently, TACs have
   been kept low and some fishing grounds have been closed to the industry.
   Since 1992 the Namibian lobster research programme has been intensified,
   incorporating regular environmental and lobster surveys on the main
   fishing grounds. During the environmental surveys, a seasonal cycle in
   bottom concentrations of dissolved oxygen observed during the 1980s was
   confirmed along the southern part of the Namibian coast. This
   seasonality in environmental parameters is thought to contribute to
   inshore-offshore migrations of the lobster populations and thus to
   variable catch rates. Results from commercial and research samples over
   the past five years indicate improved recruitment and increased,
   although variable, catch per unit effort.}},

   relation to DMSP}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{17-24}},
Abstract = {{The population of dimethylsulfide (DMS)-producing bacteria together with
   the DMS and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) concentrations were
   monitored from July 1995 to August 1996 in Tokyo Bay, Japan. The
   concentration of DMS varied widely in the range from 2 to 130 nM, and
   the total, dissolved and particulate DMSP concentrations varied from 5
   to 220 nM, from below the detection Limit to 75 nM, and from 5 to 200
   nM, respectively. The observed particulate DMSP concentration was well
   explained by the DMSP attributable to Dinophyceae, estimated from the
   species-specific DMSP per cell contents. The population of DMS-producing
   bacteria enumerated by the Most Probable Number method was in the range
   from 1.6 x 10(3) to 9.2 x 10(4) cells ml(-1). A positive relationship
   was found between the population of DMS-producing bacteria and the total
   DMSP concentration in some months, suggesting an important role of
   bacteria in DMS production. However, some other data points showed the
   small population of DMS-producing bacteria in spite of the high
   concentrations of DMS and total DMSP. These data did not agree with the
   above relationship and suggest a contribution of non-bacterial DMS
   production under certain circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Visual survey techniques are used widely to estimate abundances of
   target organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments. There are a
   number of methodological `errors' in almost all applications of visual
   surveys. Given the dependence of all visual survey data on the skill and
   technique of the observer, one potentially important source of
   imprecision and/or bias is variation among and within observers. In
   studies involving large amounts of fieldwork over great geographic range
   and many years, it is inevitable that observers will change from place
   to place and through time at any single site as they are replaced or
   gain experience. We present the results of 3 observer
   training/calibration exercises that indicate that observational studies
   in which multiple observers must be employed may be subject to
   considerable observer-related biases and imprecision. We found that
   careful training and calibration of observers ameliorated such effects
   for most taxa, but non-trivial levels of bias for some taxa and
   imprecision in estimates for several taxa remained even after thorough
   training. It is essential that the influence of observer bias and
   imprecision be well documented in multi-observer monitoring studies, so
   that (spurious) patterns related to differences among observers can be
   distinguished from real spatial or temporal patterns in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Daily zooplankton samples were obtained from the Etang de Thau, France,
   a 70 km(2) coastal lagoon of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The
   survey was monitored at 2 stations inside the lagoon and at 1 station on
   the seaside during 4 periods in 1994. The microzooplankton, towed with a
   40 mu m mesh size net, included tintinnids, rotifers, anthozoan larvae,
   and crustacean and mollusk larvae. The tintinnids and rotifers have not
   been studied in the lagoon yet. Over all the sampling periods, their
   mean biomass represented between 26 and 45\% of the net collected
   microzooplankton biomass, which was estimated by image analysis. Their
   biomass in the central part of the lagoon free of anthropic activity was
   close to the level observed at the nearby seaside. However, at the
   shellfish culture area, the occurrence of oysters and of epibiotic fauna
   resulted in a drastic biomass reduction of these taxocoenoses by a
   factor of 10 compared to values measured in the middle of the lagoon.
   Samples collected during the fall indicated well-developed tintinnid and
   rotifer populations in this season. Inside the lagoon these populations
   seemed to be already abundant in early spring (March and June samples).
   An ordination of taxa biomasses showed 2 main factors which might have
   contributed to the organization of the tintinnid and rotifer
   assemblages: the geographical position and the thermal period. The
   geographical position integrated the lagoon-sea water exchange. The
   thermal period reflected both the populations' development cycles and
   the environmental constraints. The resulting effects appeared in
   assemblages structured in a space and time gradient. The capacity of the
   tintinnids and rotifers to quickly colonise the habitat (reproduction
   modes, resistance forms) and to use a wide range of food resources
   (organic matter, bacteria, pico- and nanoplankton) Likely enhances their
   ability to serve as trophic Links between primary and secondary
   producers. Hence, their function in the lagoon ecosystem is not minor.}},

Abstract = {{Most coral reef fish have a bipartite Life-history characterized by a
   pelagic larval phase followed by transformation and settlement into a
   benthic existence. There is increasing interest among marine ecologists
   in determining the importance of post-settlement processes to reef fish
   demography. This study distinguishes movement as an important
   post-settlement phenomenon affecting estimates of early survivorship of
   juvenile coral reef fishes. Individuals settling onto artificial patch
   habitats were collected, marked, released and monitored by visual census
   over 2 systems of isolated artificial patch habitats. Some recently
   settled juvenile fish moved as much as 100 m over open sand. Probability
   of movement was dependent on species; size was a significant factor
   among species, but not among conspecifics. Survivorship calculated from
   observations of uniquely marked individuals was contrasted with
   survivorship estimated by comparing the initial number of newly settled
   individuals at a site with the number of individuals there after a given
   time interval. The comparison revealed that new settlers and immigrants
   can mask the loss of individuals included in the original census and
   thereby inflate estimates of survivorship. Comparing survival estimates
   with and without accounting for movement demonstrated that survivorship
   can be underestimated when new settlers subsequently emigrate and
   survive at another site, but are unwittingly recorded as lost due to
   mortality. Significant differences were observed in survival experiences
   for different species and size classes. Where significant differences
   were found in survival times of mobile individuals versus sedentary,
   those that moved survived longer.}},

Abstract = {{Gross sedimentation rates (GSR) were monitored together with the main
   characteristics of the collected material (i.e. organic content, C, N,
   total proteins, Lipids, carbohydrates, available proteins and amino
   acids) over a 2 yr cycle at a shallow station (18 m) of the bay of
   Banyuls, France. In addition, sediment pigment concentrations and
   meiofaunal densities were recorded monthly during a 1 yr period. GSR
   ranged between 0.6 and 317.8 g DW m(-2) d(-1). Spring and summer were
   characterized by relatively low and constant GSR whereas fall and winter
   were characterized by relatively high and highly variable GSR. There was
   a negative relationship between GSR and the organic content of material
   collected within the sediment traps, suggesting the importance of
   resuspension in controlling GSR. Growth rates of the deposit-feeding
   bivalve Abra ovata fed sediment trap material collected on 6 sampling
   dates were also measured. Significant changes in important nutrient
   components (e.g. available proteins) of sedimenting materials from these
   different sampling dates correlated with growth differences and
   confirmed the existence of temporal changes in the quality of the
   material collected in the sediment traps. The highest growth rate was
   obtained for the material collected during May 1993, which coincided
   with maximal meiofauna densities and maximal pigment concentrations at
   the surface of the sediment. The best description of growth was obtained
   when using available proteins and total lipids as the independent
   variables of simple linear regression models. This supports the use of
   these parameters as descriptors of food quality. The consequences of our
   results on the parameterization of changes in food quality within models
   of continental shelf food webs are discussed, It is suggested that such
   changes should be simulated through control functions based on available
   protein contents.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Thirty years ago, Thorson (1966; Neth J Sea Res 3;267-293) calculated
   that juvenile mortality in marine bivalves could exceed 98.6\%.
   Subsequently, juvenile mortality rates have been assumed to be high and
   to influence the evolution of life history traits. However, there have
   been no attempts to establish whether high juvenile mortality is common
   or to determine if interspecific trends in juvenile mortality exist. To
   address this issue, we reviewed 30 studies of age-specific mortality
   among bivalves, gastropods, barnacles, ascidians, bryozoans and
   echinoderms. High juvenile mortality is widespread among benthic marine
   invertebrates, with 20 of the 30 studies reporting levels of juvenile
   mortality >90\%. Mortality is particularly high during the first moments
   of juvenile life, and can exceed 30\% during the first day. Pooling
   survivorship data from all species revealed a general trend, with
   survivorship decreasing exponentially during the first days or weeks of
   juvenile life until, by the age of 4 mo, virtually all cohorts were
   reduced to <20\% of their initial numbers; mortality remained low
   thereafter. We suggest that extreme vulnerability at the onset of
   juvenile life is a shared trait that is largely responsible for the
   survivorship trend. Natural variation within this trend would be largely
   due to variation in intensity of mortality factors. Predation and
   desiccation are well-documented causes of juvenile mortality, but the
   current lack of data on factors such as ultraviolet radiation, diseases,
   and `internal' causes (energy depletion, developmental and physiological
   defects) precludes a ranking of factors as selective pressures. Methods
   used to quantify juvenile mortality vary considerably in the level of
   resolution they can achieve within the early juvenile period. Studies of
   early juvenile mortality should ideally monitor the fate of individuals
   from the onset of juvenile life, using sampling intervals less than or
   equal to 1 d. Mapping and imaging techniques can provide accurate
   results for sessile organisms, whereas mark and recapture can be
   effective for motile animals with limited dispersal. Early juvenile
   mortality has been shown to influence population abundance and
   distribution as well as community structure. Juvenile mortality is also
   expected to be an important determinant of age at maturity, but only
   among species maturing within 4 mo of postlarval life since mortality
   remains low after the age of 4 mo. A compilation of data on age at first
   reproduction in 92 species revealed a bimodal grouping of species: 22\%
   of species maturing within 45 d after beginning juvenile life, and 60\%
   maturing after at least 1 yr. The influence of juvenile mortality on age
   at maturity will differ substantially among these 2 groups and will
   therefore not be equal or directly comparable among all species, Given
   the magnitude of early juvenile mortality and the similarities in
   mortality patterns across diverse taxa and habitats, a better
   understanding of early juvenile mortality should help researchers to
   understand how population parameters are regulated and help elucidate
   the significance of traits that characterize populations and species.}},

Abstract = {{A key land management goal for the Tall Timbers Research Station
   property (1585 ha) is to maintain upland pine-dominated habitats with
   frequent (one- to three-year) low-intensity prescribed fires to provide
   habitat for characteristic native animals, particularly the Northern
   Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). Currently, loblolly and shortleaf pine
   (Pinus taeda and P. echinata), are common in the uplands, but the
   presence of scattered longleaf pine (P. palustris) suggest that this
   species was once more common. Dominance of fire-intolerant pines on
   upland sites has led to a land management dilemma: short fire return
   intervals (1-3 years) are needed to control hardwoods in the understory,
   but it kills seedling and sapling loblolly and shortleaf pines. Low
   levels of pine regeneration has created an age structure dominated by
   older age classes, and a steadily increasing hardwood component. For
   ecological and economic reasons, we have initiated a project to reduce
   hardwood dominance on upland habitats on 480 hectares of Tall Timbers.
   Management actions include a timber harvest to remove merchantable
   hardwoods and combinations of drum chopping, mowing and herbicide
   treatment. Longleaf pine is being planted as part of experiments testing
   different methods of restoration. Response of songbird, Northern
   Bobwhite, Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperi) populations and ground cover
   vegetation will be monitored before and after hardwood removal.}},

Title = {{Strategies for the use of entomopathogens in the control of the desert
   locust and other acridoid pests}},
Journal = {{MEMOIRS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF CANADA}},
Year = {{1997}},
Number = {{171}},
Pages = {{5-25}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale applications of non-persistent but broad-spectrum chemical
   insecticides in Africa during the 1980s for control of acridoid pests,
   particularly the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria Forskal) and
   Sahelian pest grasshoppers, raised concern about environmental damage
   and human safety. Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia, the
   United States, and Canada and have led to a search for alternative
   strategies. To lessen dependence on chemicals, an integrated pest
   management (IPM) approach for grasshopper control has been encouraged in
   the United States with emphasis on biological control as an important
   component and this is also desirable elsewhere, but additional
   biocontrol components are needed. Current strategies for most pest
   acridoids rely on short-term destruction of outbreak populations. Nymphs
   are the preferred target wherever possible and inundative augmentation
   of entomopathogenic deuteromycete fungi formulated as biopesticides
   could replace chemical spraying in some cases, especially where the
   major threat is to crops remote from the pest breeding areas.
   Entomopathogens are slower acting than chemicals and thus best suited
   for use where the pest is not immediately threatening to crops.
   Schistocerca gregaria and Oedaleus senegalensis Krauss pose particularly
   difficult problems because of the very large area and inaccessibility of
   their potential breeding grounds, their Very sudden upsurges, and their
   great mobility as adult swarms. Fast-acting chemicals are likely to be
   needed when rapid intervention is required to control these pests, but
   an IPM strategy could incorporate biopesticide application in the early
   stages of upsurges and also be used for swarm control in some cases.
   However, improved prediction and monitoring are needed to facilitate the
   use of biopesticides and other IPM techniques against these pests.}},

Abstract = {{Trials on the use of Metarhizium flavoviride Gams and Roszypal conidia
   in oil-based formulation for the control of grasshoppers, particularly
   Hieroglyphus daganensis Krauss, in Malanville, north Benin, are
   described. Preliminary work examined sprayer types, application rate,
   and time of application. In a trial on 4-ha plots with three replicates,
   M. flavoviride mycoinsecticide application to H. daganensis nymphs
   resulted in field population reductions of 70\% after 14 days. In
   samples incubated in cages, mortality was higher in the samples taken 3
   or 7 days after application than in the sample taken immediately after
   application, indicating the possibility of residual pick-up compared
   with direct spray impact in this environment. Significant mortality was
   still bring observed in samples collected 37 days after application; to
   investigate this further, a method for bioassaying the spore load in the
   field was developed and used to monitor the spore load in the field. The
   possibility that the results indicate the occurrence of secondary
   infections resulting from horizontal transmission of M. flavoviride is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Entomophaga grylli (Fresenius) Batko (North American pathotype 1) is a
   fungal pathogen of the clearwinged grasshopper, Camnula pellucida
   (Scudder). We present results from a field experiment conducted in
   Arizona in 1984, designed to investigate factors associated with
   seasonal patterns of cadaver persistence and sporulation by E. grylli.
   Rangeland plots at two sites were monitored daily for 8 weeks for the
   appearance of new cadavers of diseased grasshoppers during a natural
   epizootic. Cadavers were individually marked and revisited on subsequent
   days. when it was noted whether or not conidial sporulation was
   underway. Environmental variables were recorded by electronic data
   loggers. Daily probabilities of cadaver disappearance and fungal
   sporulation were analysed in relation to site, date, and Various
   measures of cadaver status, sporulation history, and environmental
   variables by logistic regression analysis. The average daily rate of
   cadaver disappearance was 0.22, yielding an expected time to 50\%
   disappearance of 2.8 days. The environmental factor most significantly
   associated with cadaver disappearance was rainfall, and the most
   important host factor was age of the cadaver. The probability that
   conidia would be discharged from a cadaver over the next 24 h was most
   dependent on whether or not conidial sporulation was underway already.
   This probably reflects a state of readiness for sporulation on the part
   of the fungus. Although the probability of sporulation declined with
   increasing age of a cadaver, high rates of sporulation were predicted
   under conditions of prolonged leaf wetness and high humidity at night,
   regardless of age of the cadaver. These results, together with the
   observation that in some cadavers sequences of sporulation were
   interspersed with periods of no sporulation, suggest that E. grylli may
   undergo cycles of dehydration and rehydration, in which conidial
   production is interrupted and then resumes in response to changing
   environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Initial promising results with the microsporidium Nosema locustae
   Canning as a means of controlling grasshoppers have been followed by
   some cases of limited field performance. However, at sublethal doses
   this entomopathogen can reduce grasshopper feeding, reproduction and
   development, suggesting that the damage caused to range, forages and
   crops might be reduced if the prevalence of infection in the field could
   be increased over previously achieved levels. In a field experiment, we
   treated plots totalling 780 ha with bran bait containing N. locustae at
   either 2.5 or 5.0 x 10(9) spores per ha in each of two consecutive
   years, and grasshopper populations and the prevalence and degree of
   infection were monitored every two weeks during the summers, for three
   years. Little or no background infection occurred in the untreated
   plots. Infections of grasshoppers with N. locustae in the treated plots
   during the first year of application, typically increased from less than
   5\% by the 4(th) week to 10-15\% by the 8(th) week after application The
   higher application rates resulted in only slightly higher percentages
   infected. Most of the infections were classified by microscopic
   examination as trace to moderate, although heavy infections were
   observed in the second year. Up to 35\% of some Melanoplus species
   collected from the treated plots were found to contain N. locustae
   spores, but intensive monitoring indicated population reductions that
   were inconsistent among sites and generally less than 50\%. Other
   species, notably Aeropedellus clavatus, Ageneotettix deorum, Bruneria
   brunnea and Camnula pellucida, failed to acquire significant infection
   by N. locustae. The presence. of these apparently less susceptible
   species did not account for the poor overall performance of the
   treatments. Two annual applications of N. locustae did not greatly
   increase the rate or severity of infections in grasshopper populations,
   although at one of the three sites, trace infections were found in the
   treated plots six years later.
   Although Nosema may eventually have value as a component of an
   integrated grasshopper pest management system, the low virulence cannot
   be readily overcome by repeated applications.}},

Abstract = {{Near-isogenic lines in conjunction with bulked segregant analysis were
   used to identify a DNA marker in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) associated
   with the H21 gene conferring resistance to biotype L of Hessian fly
   {[}Mayetiola destructor (Say)] larvae. Near-isogenic lines were
   developed by backcross introgression BC3F3:4 ('Coker 797' {*}4/'Hamlet')
   and differed by the presence or absence of H21 (on 2RL) derived from
   `Chaupon' rye (Secale cereale L.). Bulked DNA samples were prepared from
   near-isogenic lines and BC3F2 population individuals segregating for
   reaction to Hessian fly biotype L and screened for random amplified
   polymorphic DNA markers using 46 10mer primers. Random-amplified
   polymorphic DNA markers from resistant and susceptible individuals and
   parental lines were scored and these data were used to identify a 3 kb
   DNA fragment that was related to the occurrence of H21. This fragment
   was amplified from DNA isolated from Hamlet, a near-isogenic line
   carrying 2RL, and bulked DNA from resistant BC3F2 individuals, but not
   from the recurrent parent Coker 797 or DNA bulks from susceptible BC3F2
   plants. Analysis of 111 BC3F2 segregating individuals and BC3F2:3
   segregants confirmed the co-segregation of the 3 kb DNA marker with the
   H21 resistance gene to Hessian fly. Use of this marker could facilitate
   more rapid screening of plant populations for Hessian fly resistance and
   monitoring the introgression of H21.}},

Abstract = {{Outbreaks of desert locusts are believed to start when solitarious phase
   locusts encounter favourable conditions and breed prolifically. The
   current method used to obtain the earliest warning of outbreaks is
   therefore to combine survey information on the distribution and
   abundance of solitarious phase populations with data on the distribution
   of concurrently favourable habitats. This paper introduces the idea that
   it may now be practicable to routinely supplement conventional survey
   data with information about the abundance of solitarious phase locusts
   flying at high altitude, i.e., above 100 m. The objective would be to
   detect moving solitarious phase populations, and so enhance the accuracy
   and reliability of outbreak forecasts. Routine aerial monitoring has
   recently been made possible by the advent of a new technique which uses
   inexpensive, vertical-looking radar (VLR) to detect the presence of
   insects flying overhead. The radar runs automatically for long periods,
   analyses its own data and produces plots of the density, altitude and
   direction of the insects' migration, and of their size and hence of
   their probable identity. VLRs are based on standard marine radar
   transmitters, which are mass produced, and reliable, and the systems are
   designed to be run by non-specialist personnel.}},

Abstract = {{Pheromones, both of the primer and releaser type, have been detected in
   Locusta migratoria. Research is in progress aiming at the identification
   and future synthesis of semiochemicals that might find application in
   programmes of integrated management for this pest. In laboratory
   experiments, the oviposition rhythm and fecundity of virgin females were
   to some extent stimulated by the proximity of males. Chromatographic and
   mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of the semiochemicals of L. migratoria
   migratorioides were performed, and important variations in the
   composition of the bouquet of odours emitted by different stages, and
   sexes, were detected. Thus benzyl cyanide was only produced by sexually
   mature mates, while by contrast, guaiacol was detected in nymphs and
   adults of both sexes, although females contained larger amounts.
   Different strategies, based on the use of semiochemicals, can be
   devised, aiming at the control and particularly the monitoring of
   populations of the migratory locust. Among them, the application of
   aggregation/arrestant pheromones to concentrate egg laying in
   pre-selected sites, where the eggs would afterwards be destroyed,
   preferably by bio-pesticides, should be considered. The use of
   maturation synchronisers could also be taken into account, to time adult
   development with unfavourable climatic periods. However, the
   implementation of methods resorting to the application of pheromones
   must be contemplated in combination with other techniques, such as
   cultural practices, within the scope of an encompassing Integrated Pest
   Management (IPM) programme.}},

Abstract = {{Current monitoring of Himalayan thar (Hemitragus jemlahicus) populations
   in New Zealand involves a technique based on repeated observations by
   different, experienced observers. The method gives no measure of error
   and hence does nor allow for statistical comparison of repeated surveys.
   We outline a faster and cheaper technique that enables statistical
   comparison between surveys based on mark-recapture theory. Two counts
   can be made by the same observer on subsequent evenings, or can be
   conducted simultaneously by two observers of differing experience
   provided they do not cue each other to the location of animals. As an
   example of the use of the technique, we monitored a control operation
   aimed at reducing thar impact on alpine flora. We recorded a
   non-significant (P = 0.27) decline in thar abundance from 38 (+/- 27;
   95\% C.L.) to 28 (+/- 19) females (including kids) in the survey area.}},

Title = {{Correlated extinctions, colonizations and population fluctuations in a

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{109}},

Pages = {{235-241}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of metapopulations is likely to be highly dependent on
   whether population dynamics are correlated among habitat patches as a
   result of migration between patches and spatially-correlated
   environmental stochasticity (weather effects). We examined whether
   population dynamics of the ringlet butterfly, Aphantopus hyperantus,
   were synchronous in an area of approximately 0.5 km(2), with respect to
   extinction, colonization and population fluctuations. Monks Wood
   Butterfly Monitoring Scheme transect count data from 1973 to 1995,
   revealed (A) a major environmental perturbation, the drought of 1976,
   which caused synchronized extinctions of A. hyperantus in subsequent
   years, (B) synchronized recolonization in years following the large
   number of apparent extinctions, and (C) population changes by A.
   hyperantus were highly correlated in many of the 14 sections of the
   transect, presumably re fleeting similar responses to environmental
   stochasticity, and the exchange of individuals among sections. However,
   extinction and population synchrony depended on habitat type. Following
   the 1976 drought, A. hyperantus apparently became extinct from the most
   open and most shady habitats it occupied, with some persistence in
   habitats of intermediate shading, thus showing retraction to core
   populations in central parts of an environmental gradient, albeit with
   an average shift to relatively open habitat. Populations at extreme ends
   of the environmental gradient occupied by A. hyperantus fluctuated least
   synchronously, suggesting a potential buffering effect of habitat
   heterogeneity, but this was not crucial to survival after the 1976
   drought. Thus, not all habitats are equally important to persistence.
   Correlated temporal dynamics, variation in habitat quality and the
   interaction between habitat quality and temporal environmental
   stochasticity are important determinants of metapopulation persistence
   and should be incorporated in metapopulation models.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the pattern of correlations among fitness components,
   herbivory, and resin characteristics in a natural all-aged stand of
   ponderosa pine, to infer the strength and mechanism of natural selection
   on plant chemistry. Male and female cone production were monitored
   yearly for 15 years, and levels of herbivory for 9 years in 165 trees.
   Resin flow rate and monoterpene composition were determined for these
   same trees. Multiple regression of fitness components on resin
   characteristics showed significant associations consistent with
   directional selection for increased resin flow rates and increased
   proportions of alpha- and beta-pinene, myrcene and terpinolene. However,
   negative correlations among monoterpene fractions of the resin
   constrained the overall selection. Selective herbivory by aphids
   approached statistical significance and monoterpenes showed some
   (non-significant) effect as deterrents against deer browse. Resin
   characteristics were not correlated with attack by cone insects or
   porcupines. However, the association between resin characteristics and
   fitness is significantly different from that predicted by the path
   coefficients involving herbivores. Therefore the hypothesis that these
   herbivores mediate selection on the resin is not supported by the
   observed pattern of correlations among resin characteristics, herbivory,
   growth and fecundity. In this population, most of the association
   between resin characteristics and fitness appears to be mediated by some
   other factor independent of attack by herbivore species present.}},

Abstract = {{A regression model relating cumulative pheromone trap catch and date of
   corn silking to subsequent damage in sweet corn by Helicoverpa tea
   (Boddie) was improved in one year by including additional spatial input
   parameters. Spatial inputs included information from timings and
   locations of corn plantings around the trap as well as from locations of
   wind blocking features. Wind blocking features were: tree rows, wooded
   areas, large buildings close to the trap, and abrupt hillsides.
   Pheromone traps were monitored at 28 and 30 sites in 1990 and 1991. Corn
   development through the year and damage levels at harvest (percent
   infestation) were also recorded for these locations. Maps of all corn
   plantings and wind blocking features within 2.5 kilometers of the trap
   were created, digitized, and entered into a Geographical Information
   System for each site. A stepwise regression analysis considering 18
   spatial and two non-spatial variables resulted in a highly significant
   (P < 0.001) regression model with four variables (trap catch, silking
   date, the number of hectares of corn within 2.0 kilometers of the trap,
   and the average distance to wind blocking features on the north side of
   the trap) explaining 82\% of the variability for the 1990 data. In 1991,
   of the 20 input parameters considered only one was significant, date of
   first silk. An extremely low corn earworm population was considered to
   have caused this inability to find correlations for the other parameters

Abstract = {{Mechanisms of resistance to organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides
   were investigated in larvae and adults of the oriental fruit moth,
   Grapholita molesta (Busck). Comparative studies with an N-methyl
   carbamate (carbofuran) rested with or without synergists indicated that
   more than ne factor contributed to insecticide resistance in the
   oriental fruit moth. Increases in esterase activity in both larvae and
   adults of resistant strains toward alpha-naphthyl acetate (5.5-fold for
   third instar larvae, 3.9-fold for adults), beta-naphthyl acetate
   (4.6-fold for third instar larvae, 3.8-fold for adults), alpha-naphthyl
   butyrate (4.2-fold for third instar larvae, 5.5-fold for adults), and
   beta-naphthyl butyrate (2.6-fold for third instar larvae, 2.8-fold for
   adults) model substrates and differences between strains in esterase
   patterns resolved using isoelectric focusing indicated that esterases
   were major factors in the resistance of the oriental fruit moth to
   insecticides. Differences between resistant and susceptible strains in
   inhibition of acetylcholinesterases by guthoxon (6-fold for third instar
   larvae, 10.5-fold for adults), carbofuran (33-fold for third instar
   larvae, 53.5-fold for adults), carbaryl (43.8-fold for third instar
   larvae, 1757.4-fold for adults), and methomyl (3.3-fold for third instar
   larvae, 8-fold for adults) indicated that target site insensitivity was
   another major resistance factor. Measurements of penetration of
   radiolabeled carbofuran in adults suggested that a decrease in
   insecticide uptake may supplement resistance provided by other
   mechanisms. Measurements of glutathione transferase, mixed-function
   oxidase, and aliesterase activities failed to demonstrate that these
   factors were involved in resistance. Because resistance is expressed in
   both larvae and adults, monitoring for resistance is appropriate with
   these insecticides in either life stage. (C) 1997 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The quinone acceptor pool capacity of photosystem 2 (PS2) membrane
   fragments is diminished compared to that of intact thylakoids. The
   extent of quinone pool reconstitution was highly specific for the type
   of quinone molecules used. The far most efficient component was the
   natural plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9) that exhibited significant reconstitution
   effects at very low ratios of PQ-9 per PS2. In marked contrast, the
   widely used exogenous acceptor phenyl-p-benzoquinone (Ph-p-BQ) did not
   increase the pool capacity even at a molar Ph-p-BQ:PS2 ratio of 150:1.
   The samples reconstituted with PQ-9 provided a most suitable material
   for all experiments performed in the absence of exogenous artificial
   accepters in order to avoid interference by disturbing artefacts. The
   inherent potential of PQ-9 reconstituted PS2 membrane fragments was
   clearly demonstrated by monitoring the characteristic oscillation
   pattern of flash-induced oxygen evolution. These measurements permit for
   the first time unambiguous determination of the population of
   superreduced redox states of the water oxidising complex (WOC) in PS2
   membrane fragments. A selective population of up to 90 \% can be
   achieved for redox state S-2 by suitable treatment of PQ-9 reconstituted
   samples with NH2OH.}},

Abstract = {{Biological control, the use of living organisms as pest control agents,
   is emerging as an important component of pest management programmes
   world-wide. Biological control has a long history as a public sector
   activity, characterised by government programmes on control of alien
   pests and on government and university research to develop Integrated
   Pest Management (IPM) packages based on natural enemy conservation.
   Biological control now has a growing place in the private sector, as
   biological control products and services fill niches where chemical
   control is no longer desirable.
   Beyond its contribution to the technology of pest management, biological
   control has a compelling social message for agricultural and
   environmental development, emphasising minimal intervention, natural
   processes and sustainability. This message is now helping to
   revolutionise systems for extension of pest management and conservation
   of natural habitats.
   New Zealand combines several features which make it a particularly
   important and challenging environment for biological control. Firstly,
   it has an intensely international agricultural trade, with associated
   needs to avoid and manage alien pests and to maintain high quality of
   exported produce. Secondly, it has a highly unique flora and fauna.
   which generates a demand for management of alien invasive pests of
   natural habitats and a strong concern for the ecological effects of
   introduction of biological control agents across ail ecosystems.
   Finally, it has a substantial number of important, indigenous pests such
   as grass grubs, moths and leafrollers which has stimulated development
   of local biological control products. These features have resulted in
   New Zealand becoming a world leader in regulation, research and
   implementation of biological control technologies for agricultural and
   natural habitats. a In examining the future of biological control, I
   will therefore emphasise these aspects which are of particular relevance
   to New Zealand.
   Increase in global trade under GATT has already resulted in a
   perceptible rise in the number of alien pest problems, attributable nor
   just to volume but to new trade routes, particularly the North-South
   trade in horticultural produce and the opening of China and the former
   USSR to trade in forestry products. This has increased interest in
   biological control and some countries like the USA have responded with
   rapid programmes of unprecedented scale, particularly against
   horticultural pests. New alien pests create increasing opportunities for
   non-tariff trade barriers, in which biological control may not seem at
   first a promising approach, as it may leave pest populations at
   cosmetically unacceptable levels on exported produce. However, with
   falling minimum residue levels for pesticides on exported produce,
   biological control will increasingly underpin export agriculture. Even
   more rapid growth is seen in biological control of alien pests of
   conservation, particularly weeds, where biological control is often the
   least disruptive and most cost effective control approach in extensive
   natural areas. Alien invasive spec ies are recognised today as second
   only to habitat destruction as a cause of biodiversity loss, and
   signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity are obliged to
   manage them.
   The key issues affecting biological control introductions today are
   their scientific performance and their safety. For new pest problems in
   particular, biological control projects have very high start-up costs,
   long duration and only moderate probabilities of success set, of course.
   against enormous long term economies where agents succeed. With falling
   public sector funding and a growing number of targets, ecological
   research is of increasing value in the prediction of success and
   acceleration of programmes. Ecological research is also essential to the
   expansion of safety studies required before introduction of agents.
   Biological control has grown in an agricultural b tradition where
   `'risk'' has meant risk to agriculture, but emphasis is now shifting
   towards impact on the environment and non-target species. Biological
   control has an impressive safety record, but little tradition of
   environmental impact assessment. A new international Code of Conduct for
   biological control and new national procedures for regulation and
   consensus building underpin a,srowing emphasis on biocontrol safety. The
   most significant issues here are biological control for conservation,
   where issues of risk and success converge conveniently, and commercial
   biological control. In the latter case, predators, parasites and
   pathogens introduced as commercial produces are not always recognised as
   alien introductions. Because they are generally less specific than
   introductions for `'classical biological control'' and imported through
   private rather than public agencies, they deserve particular attention.
   Use of local species for this commercial biological control is
   desirable. This approach has been stimulated in New Zealand by the
   importance of unique, native pest species.
   Commercial biological control today has established niche markets in the
   horticultural sector and in some environmentally sensitive areas (e.g.
   waterways, forests) where the relatively high prices of products like
   microbial formulations, nematodes and insect predators and parasitoids
   can be accommodated and minimising chemical pesticide use is encouraged.
   For all this, biological control products constitute less than 1\% of a
   \$30 b industry, most of this comprising sales of Bacillus thuringiensis
   by a shrinking number of companies. The growth of biological control
   products is unsatisfactory relative to demand, and new niche markets
   created by pesticide restrictions or decisions not to re-register
   products, particularly in minor crops, are not being serviced by new
   biological control technologies. This may reflect how biological control
   products have been developed by their major investors, the multinational
   agrochemical industry and the biotechnology industry. The former have
   experimented with biological control products but have generally found
   their use too complex and their markets too small to compete with
   internal chemical products. For biotechnology companies, the performance
   of engineered bacterial and viral pest control products have not
   justified the venture capital invested in them, but they have helped
   these companies with their secondary objective of developing technology
   to direct at more lucrative products such as transgenic plants. All this
   has meant that many biological control product initiatives have been
   aborted,much useful technology sits inaccessible on corporate shelves
   and there is little on the market.
   There is a need to re-examine the appropriate industrial base for
   biological control. Small markets are a problem, particularly in small
   countries like New Zealand, but there are good models for small
   biological control businesses and products. We must also free biological
   control product development from the chemical pesticide paradigm which
   has marginalized their biological properties (e.g. reproduction, host
   finding) which are in fact their most competitive features. Tomorrow's
   biological control businesses will compete with new generation selective
   chemical pesticides and transgenic plants, and their success will depend
   a great deal on public perceptions of pesticides and biotechnology.
   Biological control has found its way onto the farm and into the forest
   today as a component of IPM programmes, where it often provides the
   foundation which permits a strategy of reduced intervention with
   chemical or other products, lowering input costs, maintaining yields and
   reducing risks of pesticide-induced problems. In recent decades, IPM has
   had serious problems with successful implementation due in part to its
   knowledge-intensive nature and monitoring requirements, and in part to
   subsidy and aggressive marketing of chemical pesticides. IPM today is
   evolving along several paradigms. In the developed world, IPM is often
   seen as a predetermined package of methods focused on intervention, for
   extension to the farmer. In the developing world, iris often a more
   ecological process based on local appreciation of natural biological
   control and use of. intervention as a last resort, reflecting
   sensitivity to a history of disasters associated with over-reliance on
   chemicals. The tropical experience has engendered a successful
   participatory approach to IPM implementation called the Farmer Field
   School which extends competence in biological control beyond scientists
   to farmers and political leaders. In developed countries, there is a
   growing trend for IPM extension to farmers to be driven by commodity
   boards or, in some cases, even the retail food industry, which can
   require farmers to apply IPM packages as a condition for purchase of
   their produce. While this is making IPM happen where it has not before,
   and is introducing biological control rapidly to millions of consumers,
   the North has something to learn from the South about farmer empowerment
   and public participation in IPM and biological control.
   New Zealand's particular needs for management of alien and indigenous
   species and for environmental protection make it an important player in
   future development of biological control. Stimulated by these
   challenges, New Zealand has generated an impressive level of research
   and an unrivalled level of involvement of the general public in both
   financing and making decisions about biological control. This capability
   and commitment is a great asset in highly competitive and increasingly
   green international export markets, where biological control can help to
   create market advantage through pesticide-free produce and production
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{A persistent shortcoming of wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) management
   programs is the inconsistency in survey techniques. One approach to
   standardize turkey population monitoring is to use cameras and infrared

   pertaining to baiting and those associated with sampling design. Because
   none of these assumptions have been tested, our objective is to outline
   an experimental design appropriate for determining which theoretical
   assumptions are practically valid. We recommend that testing these
   assumptions be a priority for additional research on using camera and

   (Ardea herodias) Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model in the
   southcentral Great Plains with the aid of Geographic Information System
   (GIS) technology. From January 1993 through May 1993, populations of
   great blue herons in 18 rookeries located throughout Oklahoma were
   monitored, and GIS was used to evaluate data on rookery habitat
   structure and surrounding landscape features. Eighteen rookeries were
   classified as potential nest sites and RI ratings were determined for
   each rookery according to model criteria. The RI identified only 3
   (17\%) of the 18 rookeries as suitable habitat for reproduction. After
   modifying the RI using habitat and landscape data from the 18 rookeries
   in Oklahoma, the RI more reliably characterized the habitat suitability
   of rookeries in the southcentral Great Plains. However, it was not
   significantly related to initial size of the rookery population or its
   size at the end of the breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{The reported incidence of waterborne disease is increasing in North
   America, and the provision of drinking water and sewage treatment is
   confronted with a growing population base and either an aging or
   developing infrastructure. To combat this trend, North American drinking
   water standards are continuously reviewed and increased effort is being
   expended to monitor and improve the quality of sewage and water
   treatment. in this regard Federal, Territorial and First Nation agencies
   have been working to improve community infrastructures within the Yukon.
   The Territory's location north of 60 degrees, cultural demographics, and
   the progress of First Nation self government initiatives, presents
   challenges in the delivery of these programs that are not encountered in
   southern Canada. A study of Yukon communities was conducted in 1995 to
   produce a current compilation of services as they existed at the time. A
   summary of the existing infrastructure, policy and program background,
   unique aspects of program delivery, and future development are examined.}},

Abstract = {{Training a group of farmers through informal education on integrated
   pest management (IPM) was initiated in 1995-96 by organizing farmers
   field school (FFS) with a new approach in outreach research. Due to the
   success of an participatory outreach research approach, the activities
   were expanded during 1996-97 to three different locations in Kathmandu
   valley. Several new technologies including safer insecticides,
   biological control agents (parasitoids and microbial), pheromones,
   demoulting hormones, traditional and cultural methods were verified and
   demonstrated in the farmers' fields: FFS on vegetable crops at
   Suryabinayak in Bhaktapur, Sitapiala in Kathmandu, and Imadol and Thaiba
   in Lalitpur Districts. The training was launched on a weekly basis for
   an entire crop growth period. Overuse and misuse of chemical
   insecticides were minimized by monitoring insect-pest populations, and
   their damage. A total area of 9.2 ha was covered under the vegetable IPM
   programme in three districts and a total of 55 farmers actively
   participated in the programme. IPM in fresh vegetable gave better
   profits and less chemical insecticide use over non-IPM (Gyawali, 1996).
   Cauliflower was found more profitable than cabbage and other vegetables
   during 1996/97. Farmers were highly motivated for vegetable IPM mainly
   due to a growing threat of pesticidal pollution. Environmental damage
   and health hazards were considerably minimized by IPM approaches. Though
   the cost of IPM approaches as a package at present seems to be slightly
   higher as compared to the chemical pesticides, overall impact was
   ecologically positive, sound and sustainable on a long term basis.
   However, unavailability of IPM tools in the market as compared to
   chemical pesticides has been realized during the study period.}},

   comparisons. The data will allow us to see the immediate avian response
   to cutting;, although decades and subsequent: cutting cycles will be
   needed to evaluate the complete response. They also will allow us to
   examine avian population demographics on a scale that is unsurpassed for

Abstract = {{The status of coastal cutthroat trout in Oregon is reviewed utilizing
   data from a variety of published and unpublished sources from the Oregon
   Department of Fish and Wildlife. All four life-history types (resident,
   fluvial, adfluvial, and anadromous) are present in cutthroat trout
   populations in Oregon coastal and lower Columbia River streams. The
   various combinations represented in these life-history strategies are
   probably the most complex of any salmonid in Oregon. Resident cutthroat
   trout are widespread and are believed to be the dominant trout in most
   headwater tributaries. Multiple age classes are consistently present.
   Populations appear to be stable but likely lower in abundance than
   historic levels due to habitat loss. Fluvial cutthroat trout are likely
   present in most larger river systems in western Oregon. Data available
   indicate a mixture of healthy populations and others of unknown status,
   although they are not routinely monitored in most streams. Most fluvial
   cutthroat trout populations have been exposed to hatchery trout releases
   (either rainbow or cutthroat trout) at one time or another and are
   easily accessible to angling. Adfluvial cutthroat trout are present in a
   variety of geologic settings above and below barriers to anadromous
   fish. Most populations isolated above barriers to anadromous fish have
   not been exposed to releases of hatchery trout and are lightly fished.
   These populations are likely healthy due to low angler use and stable
   habitat. Many adfluvial populations in low-elevation lakes accessible to
   anadromous fish have been exposed to releases of hatchery trout and
   correspondingly are more heavily fished upon. These populations are not
   routinely monitored and their status is unknown. Anadromous cutthroat
   trout are believed present in most coastal and lower Columbia River
   streams that do not have upstream passage barriers in lower reaches.
   Data from dam counts and angler creel surveys on mid and north coast and
   lower Columbia streams indicate anadromous cutthroat trout have likely
   undergone a significant decline in the past decade. Potential causative
   factors include: a significant decline in nearshore ocean productivity
   since the mid-1970s, genetic and fishery consequences of widespread use
   of hatchery sea-run cutthroat trout throughout Oregon coastal and lower
   Columbia River streams, and reduction of stream and estuary habitat
   complexity due to land- and water-use activities. Proposed conservation
   measures include termination of hatchery trout stocking in streams with
   coastal cutthroat trout, more restrictive angling regulations, habitat
   projects that benefit cutthroat trout, and intensified population
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Sea-run coastal cutthroat trout are vulnerable to overharvest by sport
   angling, and special angling regulations have often been proposed to
   maintain or rebuild naturally reproducing populations. These regulations
   include creel (number) limits, size limits, terminal-gear
   specifications, and season-length restrictions used either singly, or in
   combination, to reduce harvest. In most portions of the current range of
   the subspecies, harvest is governed by general angling regulations, but
   restrictions that are specific to sea-run cutthroat trout have been
   implemented in some areas. For numerous fishes (including several
   subspecies of cutthroat trout), size limits, in conjunction with a
   reduced creel limit, have been successful in reducing negative effects
   of overharvest, provided that (1) size structure of the population (both
   current and historical) and size distribution of angler-captured fish
   are monitored closely, and (2) mortality associated with hooking and
   handling is minimal. If a substantial proportion of anglers fish with
   bait, regulations that require the release of some fish may require a
   bait exclusion. Because coastal cutthroat trout have developed diverse
   life-histories, including complex migratory patterns, sportfishing
   regulations designed to limit harvest must provide protection for all
   life stages. Information concerning biological parameters such as (1)
   size and age at maturity, (2) growth rates, (3) age and length
   structure, (4) migratory behavior, and (5) exploitation and natural
   mortality rates greatly increases the probability that specific angling
   regulations will meet management objectives. Although harvest reduction
   is only one part of an integrated management program, evidence suggests
   that special regulations should probably be incorporated in efforts to
   maintain or rebuild populations of coastal cutthroat trout.}},

Abstract = {{Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become necessary to counter modem
   threats to marine biodiversity and the sustainability of fisheries.
   Sensitive habitats, including coral reefs, estuaries and mangroves, have
   been effectively protected in large MPAs, which control resource use.
   Protection from pollution and physical destruction by fishing gear are
   important functions of MPAs in tropical and temperate regions. MPAs have
   been used to protect endangered species and to allow population
   recoveries. The advantages for fishery management include maintenance of
   spawner biomass, improvement of yield, simplified enforcement, research
   opportunity, insurance against stock collapse and maintenance of
   intraspecific genetic diversity. MPAs can be small with narrow, focused
   objectives, or large with core areas, buffer zones and exploitable areas
   to provide an integrated management approach. A variety of design
   considerations, based on ecological, fishery and socio-economic
   conditions, is presented. Optimal size and spacing have not been
   extensively tested and only theoretical arguments guide the choice of
   how much to protect. The process of establishing an MPA can be initiated
   by local communities or by governmental authorities. The former has
   better public support, whereas the latter promises a well planned system
   of MPAs. Community and industry involvement in the establishment process
   is essential for the effective functioning of MPAs. Successful MPAs are
   administered by national programmes and managed according to management
   plans. Monitoring, communication and enforcement are integral components
   of MPA management. South Africa is party to a number of international
   conventions which promote the designation of MPAs. Better protection of
   the physical marine environment, incorporation of MPAs in fishery
   management procedures and the management of MPAs are the major areas
   where South Africa can improve its marine protection.}},

Abstract = {{Modifications of natural land cover together with localized
   industrialization and enormous increase in motor traffic greatly
   contribute to air pollution and degradation of environmental and
   climatological quality in urban areas. As concentration of world
   population in urban areas shows an increasing trend, there is no doubt
   that climatological elements (i.e. temperature, ventilation,
   sun/shading, relative humidity) have to be integrated in urban planning
   and building to improve quality of life. The present study is aimed at
   contributing to a better understanding of climate characteristics in the
   ``heat and roughness island{''} of Rome and surrounding rural areas. The
   satellite point of view (time synchronized dense grid of data over the
   whole area) allows a double-sided approach: 1) the city as a whole, with
   its overall interactions with neighboring areas; 2) local features
   within the city. As for point 1), three Landsat TM images of a large
   area around Pome (including sea coast, Bracciano lake, Tevere valley and
   Castelli Romani) for different season and meteorological conditions have
   been compared for all bands. Effects of interaction with the regional
   circulation were observed. As for point 2), multitemporal radiometric
   and texture properties of various land cover types (different types of
   building, urban fabric and vegetation) have been analysed in nine ERS-1
   SAR.PRI images (acquired during 1992 under different meteorological
   conditions) together with Landsat TM thermal bands and NDVI. The aim is
   to obtain a classification of urban land-cover to be compared with
   temperature patterns as derived from TM thermal band. Combination of SAR
   data with NDVI looks very promising to this purpose.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a study to assess the use of ERS SAR data to map and
   monitor deforestation in Sumatra, a region characterized by rapid
   depletion of the rain forest, mainly due to logging and permanent or
   semipermanent settling of transmigrated population.
   Two approaches were used and compared (with reference to optical data)
   for forest/non forest mapping :
   1-Temporal Change approach : in the frame of the TREES/ERS-1 SAR'94
   project, previous studies have shown that up to a certain limit forested
   areas could be distinguished from non forested areas using the
   particularly stable temporal behavior of?he backscatter values of the
   forest.
   2-Interferometric approach : coherence images are realized from the
   interferometric pairs. Forest/non forest maps are realized based on the
   contrast between coherence of forest compared to that of the other land
   covers.
   Both methodology have been applied over different test sites in Central
   Sumatra and South Sumatra. This paper presents the results obtained over
   one specific site: Kayuagung in Southern Sumatra which currently
   undergoes active deforestation.}},

Abstract = {{Pests have had a greater impact on kiwifruit production in New Zealand
   than in other countries. In New Zealand kiwifruit was initially seen as
   being attacked by few insects and mites, but as production grew and
   intensified so did the spray schedule, as the need for pest control
   increased. Now consumer pressure against pesticide residues has led to
   the development of new, better control options and an integrated pest
   management (IPM) programme is being developed. A prototype IPM system
   called the Kiwigreen programme has been rapidly taken up by the
   kiwifruit industry in New Zealand. The key elements of this are
   monitoring to determine whether populations of armored scale insects
   require spraying, while the other main pests, various leafroller
   species, are controlled using a combination of monitoring and timing.
   The use of sprays of mineral oil and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which
   do not leave unacceptable residues, is another critical factor. This
   paper briefly reviews the origin of current practices. An analysis of
   the spray materials applied and their pattern of use in Kiwigreen
   orchards is presented, and compared to conventional practices.}},

Abstract = {{We documented the age and growth of alewives Alosa pseudoharenqus in
   Lake Ontario during 1978-1992 and determined if growth was affected by
   intraspecific competition for epilimnetic zooplankton, lake temperature,
   or demand of salmonine piscivores for prey. Ages of juvenile alewives
   were determined from scales during 1978-1983, and ages of juvenile and
   adult alewives were determined from otoliths during 1984-1992. Indices
   of abundance for alewives were calculated from spring bottom trawl
   catches in 1978-1992; zooplankton density and epilimnetic temperature
   were monitored at two stations during 1981-1991; and salmonine demand
   each year during 1978-1992 was calculated with a simulation model.
   Although we encountered 11-year-old alewives, few fish lived longer than
   7 years, and most fish in the population were younger than 6 years. Mean
   sizes at ages 1, 2, and 3 in spring averaged 93 mm (5.1 g), 133 mm (17
   g), and 149 mm (22 g), but from age 3 to age 8, mean size increased by
   only 5-7 mm and 2-3 g per year. Female alewives lived longer than male
   alewives and were always longer than male alewives at age 4 and older.
   Epilimnetic temperatures were suitable for rapid growth of juvenile
   alewives each year. Lake temperature had the potential to affect growth
   of adults but adult growth was not correlated with temperature
   suitability indices perhaps because temperature regimes differed among
   lake regions and alewives were mobile. Growth of alewives was not
   correlated with salmonine demand for prey. Competition for zooplankton
   among the two youngest alewife cohorts affected growth of age-1
   alewives. Zooplankton density declined sharply in 1986, and should it
   decline again, growth of age-1 alewives will slow, unless numbers of
   age-0 alewives fall. Whether growth of age-1 fish declines or numbers of
   age-0 fish fall, the result of another decline in zooplankton density
   will be a reduction in the production of alewives needed to support
   piscivores.}},

Abstract = {{Benzene in venous blood was measured in 137 workers occupationally
   exposed to benzene in petrol stations and refinery plants and in 243
   non-occupationally-exposed subjects ({''}normal{''} population). All 137
   exposed workers gave blood samples after the end of work and 125 of them
   also gave blood the following morning before resuming work. Mean
   occupational benzene exposure for all 137 workers studied was 205
   ng.l(-1) (65 ppb; range: 10-1535 ng.l(-1); 3-500 ppb). In 75 of the
   petrol station attendants the benzene exposure was 256 ng.l(-1), which
   was significantly higher (t = 2.8; p < 0.003) than in 58 refinery
   workers whose benzene exposure was 140 ng.l(-1) (range: 10-1535
   ng.l(-1)). Overall mean blood benzene of all 137 workers at the end of
   the shift was 466 ng.l(-1). The mean blood level in 77 petrol station
   workers (548 ng.l(-1)) was higher than that of refinery workers (360
   ng.l(-1)). Mean blood benzene measured the morning after was 319
   ng.l(-1), and was again higher for petrol station attendants (364
   ng.l(-1)) than far refinery workers (269 ng.l(-1)) Mean blood benzene
   measured the morning after was significantly lower than that measured at
   the end of the shift (t = 3.5; p < 0.00002). Mean blood benzene in
   smokers, both at the end of the shift (642 ng.l(-1)) a td the morning
   after (485 ng.l(-1)), was significantly higher than in non-smokers (315
   ng.l(-1) and 175 ng.l(-1), respectively). For the 243 ``normal{''}
   subjects, mean blood benzene was 165 ng.l(-1) (range: 15-940 ng.l(-1));
   levels were significantly higher in smokers (264 ng.l(-1)) than in
   nonsmokers (123 ng.l(-1)). In exposed workers, there was a significant
   correlation between end-of-shift blood benzene and environmental
   exposure (r = 0.538). Blood benzene measured the morning after
   correlated with blood benzene at the end of the shift (r = 0.544).}},

Abstract = {{Constructed wetlands have been shown to be capable of removing a wide
   variety of contaminants, including bacterial pollution. Wetlands are
   known to act as biofilters through a combination of physical, chemical
   and biological factors which all participate in the reduction of the
   number of bacteria. Five constructed wetlands in the Czech Republic were
   studied during 1994 and 1995 in order to determine removal of total and
   faecal coliform bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, total
   count of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were determined in water.
   Populations of nitrogen cycle bacteria were monitored on roots and
   rhizomes of Glyceria maxima in the system at Doksy. The results revealed
   that the retention of coliform bacteria is very high and exceeds common
   retention values for conventional systems. The measurements also
   indicated that nitrifying bacteria were not present in wastewater,
   however, quite large numbers were found on the surface of roots and
   rhizomes of Glyceria. This fact can explain the significant
   nitrification observed in this system. (C) 1997 IAWQ.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the design, construction and the monitoring of a
   vertical-flow Reed Bed Treatment System (RBTS) which achieves tertiary
   nitrification of the effluent from a biological filter, treating the
   sewage flow from a population of about 200 people. It treats the flows
   from toilets, kitchen laboratories and a saline wastewater. The RBTS
   system takes effluent from an old biological Biter and produces a
   nitrified effluent from a two-stage intermittently-dosed system. The
   paper shows the long-term performance of the system over a 4 year period
   and also describes experiments to assess the nitrification performance
   using a step-feed of ammonium nitrate solution. The system shows a
   removal of 8-13 g NH4-N/m(3) of bed day. The design basis is shown and
   the operational features described. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The human waste concept of the Centre for Applied Ecology Schattweid,
   Switzerland combines treatment of feces in compost toilets and a
   constructed wetland for the liquid wastes. The wastewater of 5.1
   population equivalents (greywater and urine) is treated in a two
   chambered settling tank followed by an underground vertical flow sand
   filter and a horizontal flow constructed wetland. The wastewater system
   has been in operation since 1985. Its performance has been monitored on
   COD, NH4-N, NO3-N, NO2-N. Total-P and Total-N almost monthly since then,
   and on other parameters (Total-Fe, Cl) occasionally.
   COD elimination (91.4\%) and Total-P removal (90.6\%) were stable over
   the years, whereas NH4-N and Total-N elimination have improved markedly
   from around 55\% to 93.0\% (NH4-N) and 80.0\% (Total-N). Performance in
   winter was excellent. The addition of an easily degradable carbon source
   to the plant filter in summer 1991 led to a markedly decreased
   phosphorus retention and a washout of iron during the experiment. (C)

Abstract = {{Benthic invertebrate communities were investigated as part of the

   both situated on a northern, BC reservoir, discharge secondary-treated
   effluent within 5 km of each other. Efforts to independently distinguish
   potential effects associated with these individual discharges were
   complicated by the proximity of the diffusers their location within a
   complex ecological region of a reservoir, and the presence of temporal
   and spatial confounding influences. A comprehensive examination of the
   benthic community structure involved the combined assessment of several
   endpoints (total population numbers, relative proportion of taxonomic
   groups, and species richness). A tiered, spatial approach, based on a
   reservoir ecological model (Thornton et al., 1981), was adapted to
   assess and distinguish community structures and reservoir- and
   mill-related influences. Results suggested that effects associated with
   the two different mills could be distinguished based on subtle and
   distinct differences in benthic community profiles. (C) 1997 IAWQ.}},

   developed to deal with future pulp mills in Australia. We propose
   decision criteria that balance the chance of missing impacts and the
   chance of falsely accusing a proponent of environmental damage. Rather
   than focusing on either Type I or Type II statistical errors, we fix the
   ratio of the two error rates according to perceived costs of making each
   error. As monitoring is scaled up or down, risks of both errors rise and
   fall proportionately, in contrast to more traditional approaches, in
   which one error rate is fixed. We describe the steps necessary to
   implement a monitoring program using these criteria Our emphasis is on
   guidelines that allow the flexibility to deal with monitoring a range of
   point source discharges in coastal environments that vary widely. (C)

Title = {{Monitoring nest box use by cavity-nesting ducks on acid-stressed lakes
   in Ontario, Canada}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Abstract = {{Nest boxes erected on 75 small lakes near Sudbury, Canada were monitored
   annually between 1987 and 1996 to measure the response of cavity-nesting
   waterfowl to changing chemical and biological conditions of their
   nesting habitat from the effects of acidification. Nest boxes were used
   mainly by common goldeneyes Bucephala clangula and hooded mergansers
   Lophodytes cucullatus, although a few were occupied by common mergansers
   Mergus merganser and wood ducks Aix sponsa. Use by hooded mergansers and
   wood ducks increased from 1987 to 1996, while use by goldeneyes remained
   stable. Patterns in nest box use reflected general population trends
   observed in the area. Interspecific nest parasitism also increased to
   33\% of all nests in 1996, probably a consequence of more hooded
   merganser nests. Clutch size, nesting and hatching success of goldeneye
   and hooded merganser eggs were similar to values reported for
   conspecifics in other studies. Overall, interspecific nest parasitism
   did not appear to affect the nesting success of either species. Although
   goldeneyes nested more often on fishless lakes early in the study,
   overall, fish presence, pH-value, lake area and connectivity were not
   related to nesting attempts or measures of nesting success for either
   species. Therefore, it is believed that for common goldeneyes and hooded
   mergansers currently breeding in the acid-stressed Sudbury area, habitat
   characteristics have little influence on nest site selection,
   particularly when compared to their documented effects on brood-rearing.
   However, monitoring of nest boxes may prove a less expensive method than
   aerial surveys to track}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{235-241}},
Abstract = {{Sage grouse Centrocercus urophasianus have been translocated in at least
   seven states and one Canadian province, but little published information
   documents the success of these attempts. Historical and recent efforts
   at translocations are reviewed, their success evaluated and
   recommendations for future translocations are provided. Over 7,200 sage
   grouse have been translocated in at least 56 attempts to augment or
   reestablish populations since 1933. Only efforts in Colorado, Idaho, and
   Utah appear successful, however, breeding populations in these areas
   remain small. Common features of successful sage grouse translocations
   are: 1) reproductively-active birds were captured on leks at night in
   March and April, 2) birds were transported rapidly and released the
   morning following capture, and 3) release sites were isolated, islands
   of habitat surrounded by inhospitable cover distant from capture areas.
   Trans location of sage grouse is recommended only after careful
   evaluation of the release area for year-round habitat, and only if
   agencies commit resources adequate to monitor birds immediately
   post-release to assess short-term survival, and to monitor long-term
   population abundance to assess continued fate of the translocation.
   Trans locations presently should be viewed as experimental and not as a
   viable strategy to restore extirpated populations of sage grouse.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of localised, high-intensity fox baiting in reducing
   the incidence of fox predation was examined after captive-reared
   malleefowl were released and their survival monitored. Malleefowl
   released into baited areas survived longer than those released into
   nearby areas that had not been baited. Survival in both baited and
   non-baited areas was greater than that prior to any fox control. Of
   those malleefowl released, 29\% were still alive three months later,
   whereas prior to fox control almost all were killed by foxes within a
   month of release. Despite the improvement in survival of malleefowl, fox
   predation remained the primary cause of malleefowl mortality. The number
   of baits taken by foxes indicated a large fox population and a high
   level of reinfestation. A more widespread, but less intensive, regime of
   baiting failed to further enhance the survival of malleefowl. Malleefowl
   were also particularly vulnerable to-predation by raptors in habitats
   where the mallee was interspersed with areas of open woodland, and where
   the understorey was sparse. Fox baiting will need to be frequent,
   intensive and widespread to reduce fox density to levels where predation
   no longer threatens the survival or recovery of malleefowl populations.}},

   following a reduction in the abundance of noisy miners, Manorina
   melanocephala}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{631-648}},
Abstract = {{It has been postulated that aggressive honeyeaters like the noisy miner,
   Manorina melanocephala, may contribute to rural tree decline by
   excluding small insectivorous birds from remnant patches of woodland,
   thereby reducing the level of predation upon defoliating insects.
   Previous studies provide correlational evidence that avian diversity and
   abundance is lower in remnant patches of woodland occupied by noisy
   miners than in those without noisy miners. Noisy miners were removed
   from three small remnant patches of woodland in north-eastern Victoria.
   The removal of the majority of noisy miners from a site, or even the
   removal of only part of a noisy miner colony from a site, resulted in a
   major influx of honeyeaters and other insectivorous birds to these sites
   in the following three months. Such major invasions were not observed on
   matching control sites. At two of the three removal sites, this led to
   an increase in both the abundance and diversity of birds on the site. At
   the third site, there was an increase in the diversity, but not the
   abundance of birds. These experiments are the first to demonstrate that
   noisy miners affect avian diversity and abundance by aggressive
   exclusion of small birds. They also showed that if domination by noisy
   miners is reduced, small, degraded woodland remnants can support
   significant populations of some small insectivorous birds and
   honeyeaters. Noisy miners did not reinvade the experimental sites during
   the following 16 months and avian diversity and abundance remained
   higher at the experimental sites than at the paired control sites.
   Long-term monitoring is needed to determine whether the small invading
   bird species have a lasting effect upon insect populations and tree
   health.}},

Abstract = {{A feral cat population was substantially reduced by poisoning at a
   semi-arid site in Western Australia. The control programme was designed
   to protect two species of endangered native mammals that had recently
   been reintroduced to the site. Feral cats were poisoned with carcasses
   of laboratory mice, each impregnated with 4.5 mg of sodium
   monofluoroacetate (1080). Baits were placed at 100-m intervals along the
   track system each night for four consecutive nights. Kill rates were
   assessed by monitoring survival of radio-collared cats and by spotlight
   counts of cats before and after baiting. All radio-collared cats were
   killed and there was a 74\% reduction in spotlight counts of cats after
   baiting. Bait removal varied with the abundance of rabbits, the primary
   prey item for cats in this area. Effectiveness of control operations
   against feral cats is maximised by baiting at times of low prey
   abundance. Monitoring the changing abundance of the primary prey species
   provides important information for timing control operations against
   feral cats.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive management of renewable biotic resources accounts for
   uncertainties in system responses to management, with a focus on the
   reduction of uncertainties as well as harvest and other management
   objectives. Adaptive resource management is described in terms of the
   harvest of populations subject to (i) uncontrollable environmental
   variation, (ii) uncertainties about the appropriate characterization of
   resource dynamics, (iii) limitations on the controllability of harvest
   rates, and (iv) uncertainties as to population status, expressed as
   sampling variation in the monitoring of populations and habitats. By an
   appropriate extension of the `system state' to include model
   likelihoods, adaptive resource management can be defined in terms of
   Markov decision processes, with an objective of maximizing long-term
   harvest value. Recursive algorithms and a computer program are described
   for solution of the adaptive optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological lipofuscin was quantified in laboratory cultured Homarus
   gammarus to determine if the amount of pigment was correlated with age
   and culture temperature in this species. Two cohorts were monitored for
   34 and 18 months, respectively. An age dependent accumulation of
   lipofuscin concentration (expressed as \% area fraction) occurred (Y =
   -2.22 + 0.084X, R(2) = 46.8\%, p less than or equal to 0.0001 and
   incorporating carapace length as a covariate). Carapace length accounted
   for 3.3\% of the variation in lipofuscin. The effect of temperature on
   lipofuscin accumulation was assessed using three regimes: 8, 11 and 13.5
   +/- 5 degrees C. Temperature had a significant effect on lipofuscin
   accumulation (F = 15.9, p less than or equal to 0.0009). Carapace length
   also responded significantly to temperature although the trend was nor
   linear (F = 68.1, p < 0.0001). There was no significant correlation
   between lipofuscin concentration and body size in lobsters of the same
   age (r = 0.067, -0.2, 0.154 and 0.5 for each of four groups). The age
   dependent increase in morphological lipofuscin and the lack of
   correlation between body size and lipofuscin in cultured H. gammarus
   indicates significant potential for this technique as a method of ageing
   lobsters. As lipofuscin accumulation is a function of metabolic age,
   factors other than temperature, such as population density, which
   affects growth rate in the wild, could potentially affect metabolic rate
   and therefore lipofuscin accumulation. However the independence between
   growth and lipofuscin in laboratory animals indicates that this may not
   be a problem.}},

Abstract = {{Fates of three morphologically distinct populations of Arrhenatherum
   elatius were monitored following seedling transplantation into a winter
   wheat crop, or an Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and red clover
   (Trifolium pratense) ley. Two populations were corm-forming, the third
   was not. One corm-forming population was an arable weed, the other two
   populations were collected from semi-natural grassland.
   Survival within all populations of A. elatius was greater in wheat than
   grass and clover ley. Ramet numbers of all A. elatius populations
   increased following cultivation of the wheat plots.
   Productivity, measured in terms of tiller number and plant biomass,
   partially reflected site of origin. Non-corm-forming plants were most
   productive in the grass and clover ley habitat, and plants of arable
   origin were most productive in the wheat habitat. Mean productivity of
   corm-forming plants of semi-natural origin was least in both habitats.
   Arable bulbous plants produced more corms than semi-natural plants.
   Productivity was generally greater in wheat than grass and clover ley,
   when comparisons could be made.
   Non-corm-forming plants, by definition, had lower maximum stem diameters
   than those which formed corms. The maximum diameter of corms from the
   population of arable origin was significantly greater than that of the
   corm-forming population of semi-natural origin in ley, and tended to be
   greater in wheat.
   Phenotypic categorisation highlighted differences between the
   non-corm-forming population and the corm-forming populations. Mean
   phenotype of non-corm-forming plants in grass and clover ley plots
   changed over time, plant stems becoming marginally thicker. The two
   corm-forming populations could not be distinguished by phenotype in ley
   plots, although in wheat there was a tendency for plants of arable
   origin to have a more bulbous phenotype.
   Corm-forming plants delayed regrowth from corm reserves until late
   spring, whereas non-corm-forming plants grew throughout the winter. This
   life-cycle difference may explain their different niches.}},

Abstract = {{Computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) has been used to analyse the
   effects of cadmium and zinc on the motility of fish sperm treated either
   for 24 h after partial dilution in an extender, or during the final
   dilution step on the microscope stage during video recording. The
   progressive motility of catfish sperm, which was not affected by storage
   for 24 h, was decreased after exposure to 100 ppm cadmium or 2000 ppm
   zinc in extender for 24 h. Only 1000 ppm cadmium or 2000 ppm zinc had
   any effect on motility when added to sperm at the final dilution stage.
   These results suggest that concentrations of cadmium which have been
   found to be present in fish gonads as a result of bioaccumulation from
   the water or diet may decrease the motility of sperm during maturation
   or storage in the testis. Cadmium toxicity was significantly decreased
   in the presence of an equal amount of zinc, suggesting an equilibrium
   between zinc and cadmium at binding sites in the sperm. Computer
   assisted sperm analysis is shown for the first time to provide a rapid
   and quantitative measure of the effects of environmental pollutants on
   the quality of fish sperm. It is suggested that the methodology
   described may form the basis for a standard toxicity test to assess the
   potential hazards of environmental pollutants on reproduction.}},

Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment compared macroinvertebrate colonization of three
   types of introduced substrate, which differed only with respect to the
   provision of prey refuges, in the presence of natural densities of
   predatory, stream fish (Ctenogobius duospilus: Gobiidae) in the Lam
   Tsuen River, Hong Kong. Replicated Hester-Dendy multiplate samplers
   (MPS's) were used to manipulate prey refuges by adjusting the spacing
   between plates while keeping surface area and complexity (heterogeneity)
   constant. Where plates were closely spaced, predators could not gain
   access to the surface of the MPS's to capture prey; wide spacing
   permitted access by all predators, while small predators only could gain
   access to plate surfaces where the spacing was intermediate. Densities
   of macroinvertebrate colonizers on MPS's were monitored after 7, 14, 21
   and 29 days in the stream.
   Density (all species combined) and morphospecies richness of
   macroinvertebrates colonizing MPS's over a 29-day period decreased in
   the order close > intermediate = large spacing providing evidence of a
   beneficial effect of refuges on prey assemblages. There was also a trend
   towards greater abundance of colonizers on MPS's with increasing time.
   Densities of the majority of taxa were highest on MPS's with close
   spacing, but not all taxa exhibited increased abundance with time. The
   thiarid snail, Brotia hainanensis, which was not eaten by Ctenogobious
   duospilus, was the only macroinvertebrate taxon to exhibit significantly
   lower densities on MPS's with close spacing. Abundance was greater on
   MPS's with intermediate and wide spacing. By contrast, densities of
   those macroinvertebrate taxa which were vulnerable to fish predation
   were enhanced by the refuges on closely-spaced MPS's.
   In order to confirm the importance of refuges in reducing predator
   impacts, replicated MPS's with close and wide spacing were enclosed
   individually inside coarse meshed (3.5 mm) net bags and placed in the
   stream. The bags prevented predator access but allowed macroinvertebrate
   colonization. Faunal densities were monitored after 14 and 28 days
   colonization. Macroinvertebrate densities (all species combined as well
   as individual taxa) and morphospecies richness on MPS's enclosed in nets
   were rather similar after 14 and 28 days regardless of spacing
   treatment. Where inter-treatment differences were noted. there was no
   consistent trend: i.e., some taxa were more numerous in the
   closely-spaced treatment, whereas the abundance of others (and densities
   of all species combined) was greater in the wide-spacing treatment. In
   essence, the beneficial effects of refuges on prey density and
   morphospecies richness disappeared when predators were excluded.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on the body condition of females of the Riviere George
   caribou herd (RGH) in northern Quebec have shown that fat reserves
   declined markedly during the first month of lactation. For many
   populations of reindeer and caribou, it is widely accepted that insect
   harassment can affect food intake, energy expenditure, and consequently
   the accumulation of body reserves. To assess the role of biting and
   parasitic insects on caribou body condition, we monitored the behaviour
   and habitat use of RGH females from late June to early August in summers
   1992 and 1993. In 1992, biting insect activity started on 27 July, while
   in 1993, insects were active from 14 July. Oestrids were present on the
   post-calving range in 1993 only. In both summers, we observed caribou
   harassed by flies on only four days. When insects were present,
   harassment reduced the time spent feeding from 53\% to 30\%, increased
   the time spent standing from 1\% to 39\%, and modified habitat use
   towards snow patches. Insect harassment had a significant impact on
   caribou behaviour, but its contribution to the negative energy balance
   during the first month of lactation seems negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in spatial and temporal patterning of flowering by
   populations of rainforest trees fed upon by honeyeaters and
   flower-visiting parrots was studied for 2 years in lowland tropical hill
   forest in Papua New Guinea. All 2200 trees in a 3 ha plot were tagged,
   identified, mapped and monitored monthly. Of 274 tree species present,
   86 flowered during the course of the study; during any given month,
   approximately 20\% of the species flowering that month were visited by
   nectarivorous birds. Results showed that overall flower resources (total
   number of species, and number of bird-pollinated species, individuals
   and flowers) fluctuated during the year, decreased during the dry season
   and increased during the wet season. In addition, there was a wide range
   of temporal variation within and among tree species in length and timing
   of flowering period, percentage of each conspecific population flowering
   from year to year, and degree of synchrony among flowering conspecifics.
   Spatial dispersion of tree populations also varied, from clumps to
   scattered single individuals. Resident bird species were correlated with
   synchronously flowering trees, whereas nomadic bird species were
   correlated with asynchronously flowering trees. Resident birds were also
   associated with smaller blooming displays per tree, whereas nomadic
   birds were associated with trees that bloomed massively. There was no
   correlation between avian nomadism and spatial dispersion of tree
   populations. Thus nomadic birds seem to range in search of rich but
   unpredictable resources; resident birds may rely more on predictable,
   but smaller resources.}},

Abstract = {{A population of frillneck lizards, Chlamydosaurus kingii, was monitored
   by radio telemetry and mark-recapture techniques between April 1991 and
   April 1994, as part of a landscape-scale fire experiment, in Kakadu
   National. Park, Northern Territory. The study aimed to investigate both
   the short- and longer-term effects of fire on a lizard species in a
   tropical savanna where fires are frequent and often annual. Frillneck
   lizards are able to survive fires that occur in the first few months of
   the dry season by remaining perched in trees. A high level of mortality
   (29\%) occurred during late dry-season fires, along with changes in
   their behavioural response to fire: sheltering in either larger trees or
   hollow termite mounds. Food is more accessible after fires due to the
   removal of ground vegetation This is reflected in greater volume and
   diversity of prey in stomach contents after fires. This increase is more
   pronounced after late dry-season fires, possibly due to increased
   accessibility of prey caused by more complete vegetation removal.
   Frillneck lizards show an overall preference for trees with a dense
   canopy cover located in an area with a low density of grass. Fire has an
   effect on this relationship. Frillneck lizards in habitat unburnt for a
   number of years tend to perch, in trees with a smaller canopy, whereas
   lizards in annually burnt habitat perch in trees with a dense canopy.
   Volume and composition of Lizard stomach contents was broadly similar
   among fire treatments over a 2 year period, although termites were more
   predominant in stomach contents of lizards in unburnt habitat.
   Wet-season body condition is lower in lizards from unburnt habitat,
   although the reason for this is unclear. These results demonstrate the
   importance of different fire intensities and regimes on the ecology of a
   lizard species in a tropical savanna.}},

Abstract = {{Prime malice lands that once supported high densities of malleefowl,
   Leipoa acellata in New South Wales have been extensively cleared for
   agriculture. Malleefowl are now restricted largely to more arid habitat.
   Given the added competition from introduced herbivores, there is concern
   that these marginal habitats may not contain sufficient food resources
   to support viable populations of malIeefowl, particularly in times of
   drought. An opportunistic feeding strategy and omnivorous diet enable
   malleefowl to exploit a diverse array of food items. Vegetative and
   invertebrate food resources available to malleefowl in marginal mallee
   lands were monitored over a period of I year during drought. Food
   resources were varied, transient and patchily distributed. Composition
   and abundance fluctuated considerably, but potential food was never
   entirely absent. Despite the prevailing drought, food was obtainable
   throughout the year provided malleefowl adapted to the fluctuating
   availability of each of the various potential food resources. Reduced
   food resources in marginal habitat is not implicated as a major factor
   in the demise of the malleefowl. Food was most abundant: between August
   and November, inclusive, due largely to the abundance of herbs, the
   diverse supply of buds, flowers and fruit on perennial shrubs, and the
   sporadic proliferation of cockroaches. Food availability was least, and
   therefore most critical, during February, March and June. The most
   favourable time of the year, in terms of available food resources, for
   the release of captive-bred individuals was during spring, around
   September.}},

Abstract = {{A study of seasonal food availability and quality for Cretan wild goat
   or agrimi Capra aegagrus cretica introduced on Atalandi Island, Greece,
   was conducted during 1988-89. The major portion of available forage
   consisted of Olea europaea var, sylvestris, Pistacia lentiscus and
   Cistus spp. The first two species are the main food resources in late
   summer and early autumn, the critical period for agrimi nutrition, and
   the only species with crude protein (CP) content exceeding maintenance
   requirements of agrimi. Grasses contained the highest level of neutral
   detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) among all plant
   categories in all seasons. Herbaceous species had the lowest level of
   lignin and shrubs the highest. In vitro organic matter digestibility
   (IVOMD) of herbaceous species was >50\% only in spring. During summer
   only Olea europaea produced sufficient forage with digestibility c.
   50\%. Future management must be directed toward maintaining a balance
   between vegetation productivity and grazing pressure. Maintaining the
   agrimi population at grazing capacity would allow an increase of
   productivity of palatable species. The seeding of palatable native herbs
   would provide nutritious feed for the agrimi and reduce the grazing
   impact. Continuous monitoring of the agrimi population, vegetation and
   soil trends is considered indispensable. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Plant characteristics often influence the distribution of herbivores and
   natural enemies. In turn, the degree of their spatial association is
   likely to influence the ability of natural enemies to control pests.
   Also, an understanding of pest distribution patterns is important for
   the development of reliable and cost-effective sampling protocols. In
   this study, we assessed the effect of cotton variety and developmental
   stage on the within-plant distribution and degree of spatial overlap
   between populations of two thrips species and their predators. In the
   two studied varieties, cv. Pima and Acala, almost all Thrips tabaci
   Lindeman inhabited the leaves, while Frankliniella occidentalis
   (Pergande) colonized only the flowers. With respect to the predators,
   most Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) were found on the leaves of both
   varieties, whereas predatory Orius spp. colonized mainly the flowering
   structures on Pima plants but the leaves on Acala. This variability in
   prey and predator distribution resulted in a significant and positive
   correlation between thrips and predator populations on Pima but not on
   Acala plants. The results also suggest that, overall, thrips are most
   likely to be preyed upon on squares and to be relatively safe in
   flowers. An intermediate but relatively high risk of predation
   apparently occurs on the leaves. The significance of these within-plant
   distribution patterns for the monitoring of thrips populations is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Geostatistics were used to quantify spatial variation in captures of
   adult male gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar (L.) in pheromone-baited traps
   in the central Appalachians. Spatial variation was analyzed in the
   infested zone, where yearly total capture was > 300 moths per trap; the
   transition zone, where moth capture ranged from 1 to 300 moths per trap;
   and the uninfested zone, where moth capture was < 1 moth per trap. The
   trend associated with gypsy moth spread was removed in each zone using
   linear and nonlinear regression. Spatial correlation among trap captures
   in the transition zone (correlogram sill, 0.544; range, 31.2 km) was
   much stronger than in the infested (sill, 0.269; range 23.9 km) and
   uninfested (sill, 0.222; range, 19.7 km) zones. Additional short-range
   correlation (range, 1.4 km) was detected in the uninfested zone.
   Differences in the spatial distribution of male moth populations among
   the 3 zones may be caused by different dominating population processes
   in each zone. Other factors, such as trap saturation, also may
   contribute to the difference in the patterns of moth captures. Obtained
   zone-specific geostatistical parameters can be used for interpolation of
   moth captures at unsampled locations and for improving gypsy moth
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium, zinc and copper levels were determined in the renal cortex and
   liver of 60 inhabitants of Cracow, Poland. Cadmium levels in the renal
   cortex were contained in broad limits of 5-176 mu g/g, mean 50.6 mu g/g
   (wet weight). Maximum levels were found in the age group of about 50-60
   years. The levels were slightly higher in men (53 mu g/g) than in women
   (45 mu g/g), with no effect of location within the region. The levels in
   smokers (62 mu g/g) were much higher than in non-smokers (32 mu g/g).
   The above relations were less pronounced for cadmium levels in the
   liver. Whole body retention of cadmium followed the pattern of cadmium
   in renal cortex. The level of zinc in renal cortex reflected those of
   cadmium. A significant proportion of the population (54\% in smokers,
   9\% in non-smokers) showed cadmium levels in renal cortex exceeding the
   reference level of 50 mu g/g recently accepted for general population.
   In the view of the authors the exposure to cadmium of the population of
   Cracow is excessive and calls for attention.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of levels of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) gene expression in
   sentinel species of fishes has been proposed as a management tool to
   evaluate contamination of aquatic systems. Based on preliminary studies,
   we hypothesized that differences in CYP1A mRNA inducibility among
   individuals, populations, or species might lead to spurious conclusions
   when using this approach in environmental monitoring programs. To
   address this possibility, we quantitated and compared CYP1A mRNA
   induction levels in four species of common Atlantic Coast estuarine
   fish: smooth flounder, hogchoker, striped bass, and Atlantic tomcod,
   which were treated with model chemicals (beta naphthoflavone (beta-NF),
   or benzo{[}a]pyrene at 10 ppm) known to induce CYP1A mRNA, or were
   exposed to contaminated environments. Species-specific CYP1A DNA probes
   were generated from PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of
   genomic DNA using conserved oligonucleotide primers, and, along with
   cloned rainbow trout and Atlantic tomcod CYP1A cDNA probes were used to
   quantify CYP1A mRNA levels in northern blot analyses. Successful PCR
   amplification of CYP1A hybridizable DNA fragments was observed for all
   four species. Results from northern blot analyses showed large
   differences in CYP1A mRNA induction among species; only Atlantic tomcod
   exhibited significant induction of CYP1A mRNA for both chemically
   treated (97-fold) and environmentally exposed fish (34-fold).
   Significant, although lower, levels of induction were observed in
   beta-NF treated (14-fold) smooth flounder, but not in environmentally
   exposed smooth flounder. Only low levels (not significant) of CYP1A gene
   induction were detected in hogchokers and striped bass. We conclude that
   CYP1A mRNA inducibility differed significantly among fish taxa perhaps
   due to differences in regulation of gene expression, suggesting that
   careful selection of sentinel species should be exercised prior to the
   use of CYP1A mRNA induction in environmental monitoring programs.
   However, the significance of differences in CYP1A mRNA inducibility in
   relation to higher level biological endpoints has yet to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Only orchids affect pollination by the deceptive sexual attraction of
   male insects, a syndrome particularly well developed in Australia. We
   examined the ecological and genetic consequences of exclusive
   pollination by sexually attracted male thynnine wasps in the orchid
   Caladenia tentaculata. Male wasps respond rapidly to flowers
   artificially presented in 1 x 1 m(2) experimental patches. Sixty of 287
   wasps approached within centimeters of the flower but did not land. Of
   the remaining 79\% who made floral contact, only 7.5\% attempted
   copulation, the step critical for pollination. Wasps only rarely moved
   among patches (19\% of flights) and none attempted copulation a second
   time, resembling observations in natural populations. We confirmed
   outcrossing and long distance pollen flow by monitoring how colored
   pollen moved in natural populations. Pollen movements approximated a
   linear rather than a leptokurtic distribution (mean distance: 17 m;
   maximum: 58 m). Pollinator visits varied independently of flower density
   in three of four populations with most solitary flowers being visited.
   Allozyme analysis revealed within-population fixation indices (F) close
   to zero and low levels of differentiation (FST) among populations.
   Despite behavioral evidence for long distance pollen flow, significant
   local genetic structure exists, perhaps reflecting restricted seed
   dispersal. Long distance pollen flow in C. tentaculata may therefore
   promote outbreeding by minimizing pollen transfers among related
   neighbors. Although this species is self-compatible, outcrossed progeny
   develop significantly faster than selfed progeny. Effective pollination
   at low flower densities could accentuate this advantage. The data are
   consistent with the predictions that deceptive pollination will result
   in long distance pollen flow, which may be of selective advantage at low
   density. Comparative studies of how food reward, food deceptive, and
   sexual deceptive pollination systems vary within a phylogenetic
   framework could further illuminate the evolution of sexual deception.}},

Title = {{The effects of acid episodes on Lepomis sunfish recruitment and growth
   in two ponds in Massachusetts, USA}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{731-744}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. The effects of transient acidity on the recruitment of Lepomis
   sunfish were examined in two ponds in Plymouth County, Massachusetts
   with on-site monitoring systems. One pond had low buffering capacity and
   was sensitive to acidification and acid spikes, the other had better
   buffering with no acid spikes. Pond pH was continuously monitored over 3
   years.
   2. Young-of-the-year (YOY) sunfish were collected and through otolith
   analysis aged in days since larval metamorphosis. Day-classes were
   constructed from these age data. The YOY swim-up day-class distribution
   was more irregular with pronounced gaps in Maquan Pond than in the
   better-buffered Furnace Pond.
   3. The poorly buffered pond, Maquan, experienced irregular acid spikes,
   defined as a sudden lowering of pond pH from about 6.6 to below 5.3 for
   an hour or more. These spikes were associated with rainfall (P < 0.005).
   Acid spikes were not found at Furnace Pond.
   4. The occurrence of acid spikes and diminished day-classes from
   expected swim-up values were significantly associated, based on pooled
   data from 3 years at Maquan Pond.
   5. Transient acid spikes at Maquan Pond appear to harm Lepomis YOY at
   the vulnerable stage of metamorphosis, when their gills become fully
   functional and exposed to the environment.
   6. Growth rates of Lepomis YOY were also studied. Length-age and
   weight-length growth relationships were examined for differences in
   instantaneous growth coefficients between years and between ponds.
   Length-age instantaneous growth coefficients ranged from 0.0114 to
   0.0176 over five pond-years. The slowest growth rates were in a warm,
   dry spawning season with the earliest average metamorphosis date.}},

Abstract = {{1. We monitored the density, recruitment and condition (body mass at a
   given shell length) of unionid clams in the freshwater tidal Hudson
   River before and during the early years of the zebra mussel (Dreissena
   polymorpha) invasion of the river. Zebra mussels were first seen in the
   river in 1991 and were dominant by the end of 1992.
   2. Despite high densities of zebra mussels in the Hudson, only 30\% of
   the unionids were infested with zebra mussels, far fewer than predicted
   by published models of zebra mussel-unionid interactions. We do not know
   why so few unionids were colonized.
   3. After the arrival of the zebra mussel, densities of unionid clams
   fell by 56\%, recruitment of young-of-the-year unionids fell by 90\%,
   and condition of unionids fell by 20-50\%. These changes occurred in all
   three of the common unionid species in the river.
   4. Elliptio complanata appears to have been less severely affected by
   the zebra mussel than were Anodonta implicata and Leptodea ochracea,
   judging by declines in density, recruitment and condition.
   5. Our results suggest that unionids may be affected by zebra mussels by
   competition for food as well as by fouling.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1955, the nuclear industry has become a comprehensive industrial
   system in China, for which the radiological impact assessment began in
   1981, Within 80 km region of each facility, investigation of population
   distribution, crop distribution, and food consumption has been made,
   Meteorological, hydrological, and geological data as well as effluent
   and environmental monitoring data have been obtained and analyzed. All
   the calculations were performed through the Y3001 computer code, The
   effective dose equivalents to all the critical groups near the region
   nuclear facilities are below the dose limits. The dose to about 80\% of
   the critical groups are less than 1/10 of those caused by natural
   radiation exposure (2.3 mSv y(-1)), The total annual average collective
   effective dose equivalent resulting from the nuclear industry as a whole
   is 23 person Sv y(-1), which is less than 0.01\% of that from natural
   radiation and far below the detriment resulting from non-nuclear

Title = {{Bayesian prediction of mean indoor radon concentrations for Minnesota
   counties}},
Journal = {{HEALTH PHYSICS}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{922-936}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Past efforts to identify areas with higher than average indoor radon
   concentrations by examining the statistical relationship between local
   mean concentrations and physical parameters such as the soil radium
   concentration have been hampered by the variation in local means caused
   by the small number of homes monitored in most areas. In this paper,
   indoor radon data from a survey in Minnesota are analyzed to minimize
   the effect of finite sample size within counties, to determine the true
   county-to-county variation of indoor radon concentrations in the state,
   and to find the extent to which this variation is explained by the
   variation in surficial radium concentration among counties. The analysis
   uses hierarchical modeling, in which some parameters of interest (such
   as county geometric mean radon concentrations) are assumed to be drawn
   from a single population, for which the distributional parameters are
   estimated from the data. Extensions of this technique, known as random
   effects regression and mixed effects regression, are used to determine
   the relationship between predictive variables and indoor radon
   concentrations; the results are used to refine the predictions of each
   county's radon levels, resulting in a great decrease in uncertainty. The
   true county-to-county variation of geometric mean radon levels is found
   to be substantially less than the county-to-county variation of the
   observed geometric means, much of which is due to the small sample size
   in each county. The variation in the logarithm of surficial radium
   content is shown to explain approximately 80\% of the variation of the
   logarithm of geometric mean radon concentration among counties. The
   influences of housing and measurement factors, such as whether the
   monitored home has a basement and whether the measurement was made in a
   basement, are also discussed. The statistical method can be used to
   predict mean radon concentrations, or applied to other geographically
   distributed environmental parameters.}},

Abstract = {{From 1991-1993, we conducted an intensive mark-recapture study of an
   island population of Florida box turtles, Terrapene carolina bauri. We
   used models based on the Jolly-Seber open population model to estimate
   abundance, after first examining the capture histories for violations of
   the underlying assumptions of mark-recapture analysis with
   goodness-of-fit tests contained in the program RELEASE. Some violations
   were detected, resulting in low estimates. We estimated that 544
   (415-672 approximate 95\% confidence interval) adult box turtles
   inhabited the southern 36.4 ha of Egmont Key in the summer of 1993. This
   estimate is similar to those of conspecific populations studied in more
   northern areas and provides a reliable initial estimate with which to
   monitor population trends in the future. Adult capture probabilities
   ranged between 0.09 and 0.30. Weekly survival probabilities for adults
   ranged between 0.94 and 1.00. There were significant differences in
   capture histories between adults and juveniles, indicating differences
   in survival and/or capture probabilities. Increased movement and
   activity of individuals on the study area during two survey periods, one
   after a severe storm and the other during the fruiting season of a
   favorite food source, was verified with one of the goodness-of-fit
   tests.}},

Abstract = {{Densities of zoobenthic species observed at different locations tend to
   fluctuate in parallel even when these sites are far apart. Climatic
   factors can synchronize population changes over wide geographic areas if
   they have a direct effect on recruitment or mortality. Several examples
   indicate that severe winters represent a major synchronizing factor
   among many of the zoobenthos species of tidal flats, both by
   immediately. enhanced mortality rates in species sensitive to low
   temperatures and by enhanced recruitment in bivalve species some months
   later. Long-term monitoring in three areas of the Wadden Sea (Balgzand,
   Groningen, and Norderney) revealed synchronous baseline patterns in the
   fluctuations of several species. Examples are shown for the polychaete
   Nephtys hombergii and the tellinid bivalve Macoma balthica. Local
   departures from such common patterns indicate local disturbing factors.
   Examples are shown on scales of about 1 km (a waste-water discharge) and
   several tens of kilometres (eutrophication in the westernmost part of
   the Wadden Sea). (C) 1996 International Council for the Exploration of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{1. Seventeen culverts and pathway passages across a high speed railway
   were monitored for one year in order to determine factors influencing
   their use by terrestrial vertebrates.
   2. Carnivores, lagomorphs, small mammals and reptiles used the passages.
   Crossing rates generally reflected the spatiotemporal variation in
   vertebrate abundance and activity, suggesting that the passages could be
   valuable in allowing movement across the railway.
   3. Wild ungulates known to be present did not use the passages, probably
   due to a combination of unsuitable dimensions and placement, a lack of
   cover near their entrances and human disturbance. Ungulates probably
   need specifically designed passages.
   4. The presence of cover in the passage entrances favoured their use by
   carnivores, while small mammals preferred narrow passages where,
   presumably, predation risk was lower. Reptiles preferred passages of
   intermediate size, in which they moved between sun-warmed and shaded
   vertical surfaces for thermoregulation.
   5. The main factor determining the use of passages by vertebrates was
   their location with respect to habitat.
   6. Minor modifications to non-wildlife passages and to the management of
   surrounding areas may further improve the efficacy of these passages for
   allowing wildlife to cross linear barriers and, therefore, potentially
   reduce the effects of habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration-mortality responses of 6-8 populations of Plutella
   xylostella (L.) from leaf-dip bioassays were compared with the mortality
   of larvae caused by residues of field applications of Bacillus
   thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki Berliner (Javelin Wettable Granules 6.4\%
   {[}AI]), and mortality of larvae in 3 diagnostic concentrations of
   Javelin (48.5, 32, and 20.5 mg {[}AI]/liter of diet) incorporated in an
   artificial diet. LC(50)s of Javelin in leaf-dip assays ranged from
   0.07-78.8 mg (AI)/liter of water. Populations with LC(50)s of 0.07-0.15
   mg (AI)/liter showed mortalities usually >80\% in field applications at
   the recommended field rate of 1.12 kg/ha, and >90\% at 2.24 kg/ha. Four
   populations with LC(50)s of 0.6-1.8 mg (AI)/liter showed mortalities
   <60\% when exposed to 1.12 kg/ha, but >75\% when exposed to 2.24 kg/ha.
   In 3 other populations with LC(50)s of 4.8-78.8 mg (AI)/liter mortality
   at 1.12 kg/ha was <7\%, and <32\% when exposed to 2.24 kg/ha.
   Mortalities of diamondback were significantly correlated with
   mortalities at 1.12 kg/ha, but correlations between 1.12 kg/ha and the
   20.5 mg (AI) concentration were higher. We concluded that LC(50)s of
   Javelin >0.6 mg (AI)/liter in leaf dip bioassays can be associated with
   low levels of mortality in field applications, and that the diagnostic
   concentration of 20.5 mg can be used as an on-farm assay for monitoring
   P. xylostella resistance to B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki.}},

Abstract = {{The population density of the Hall scale, Nilotaspis halli (Green), on
   peaches and nectarines in Israel showed 3 peaks during the year. Male
   nymphs were rare and present only in summer. Winged adult males were not
   present. Population density was significantly higher under buds closely
   attached (adpressed) to twigs compared with those that were more
   protruding. Cultivars with a higher proportion of adpressed buds had
   greater densities of scales than those with predominantly protruding
   buds. A good correlation between the number of scales in twig band traps
   and densities on buds suggests that the traps may be useful for
   monitoring. Winter buds infested by high densities of scales failed to
   sprout by spring. Scale feeding on nectarines causes red spots that
   become gradually darker over time; damage to peaches appears later,
   closer to picking time. The delayed appearance of discoloration in
   peaches suggests that late or light scale infestations may not result in
   economic damage. Egg development was suspended over winter, but resumed
   simultaneously on different early- and late-ripening varieties. The
   resumption of reproduction occurred at threshold temperatures that
   varied with the duration of exposure to low temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Five soybean varieties from maturity groups IV-VIII were routinely
   monitored in the 1993 and 1994 growing seasons to examine the effect of
   plant maturity on the seasonal abundance of velvetbean caterpillars,
   Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, and Mexican bean beetles, Epilachna
   varivestis Mulsant. Differences were detected in the population density
   of pest populations, percentage of defoliation, and yield. The early
   maturing varieties (groups IV and V) had lower mean infestations,
   although the peak A. gemmatalis populations occurred in all varieties at
   the same time in Georgia. During the population peak in mid-September,
   the group IV-V varieties were already maturing and no longer attractive
   to the damaging population densities of 30-60 A. gemmatalis per 25
   sweeps that were present oil the group VI-VIII varieties. Similar trends
   were noted for E. varivestis populations. Population peaks occurred in
   all varieties in mid-September, with highest densities in the group VIII
   variety and much lower populations in all the earlier-maturing
   varieties. Plots treated with diflubenzuron at 0.28 kg (AI)/ha in
   mid-August had lower insect populations and percentage defoliation and
   higher yields than corresponding untreated plots for all varieties
   except the group IV variety, in which no differences were detected
   because of low insect populations. Significant linear regressions were
   obtained between peak d. gemmatalis population densities and percentage
   defoliation for all 5 maturity group soybeans. Significant linear
   regressions also were obtained between population peaks and yield
   reductions for the group V-VIII varieties. The economic injury levels
   (EIL) for A. gemmatalis were lower for the group IV and. V entries
   (25-30 per 25 sweeps) than for the group VI-VIII entries (35-40 per 25
   sweeps). Thus, it appears that a standard EIL for A. gemmatalis cannot
   be established across all maturity group soybeans in the southern
   region. The soybean maturity group affected the density of both the A.
   gemmatalis and E. varivestis population peaks, but the timing of these
   peaks was similar across all varieties. The group IV and V varieties can
   be planted to escape high populations of these pests and resultant plant
   injury, and these varieties had yields comparable to the later maturing
   entries.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental fishery for Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus
   eleginoides was opened in Falkland Island waters briefly in 1992 and
   then From April 1994. One to two longlines per vessel were usually
   deployed at night, mostly fishing for 12-30 h at depths between 600 and
   2000 m. The characteristics of the vessel, gear, fishing activities and
   the data collection and analyses methods are described. An initial
   evaluation of the authors' current understanding of toothfish biology
   and population dynamics in Falkland Island waters is given. A first
   analysis of toothfish numbers caught in 1994 suggests that these are
   changing at rates faster than expected from simple demographic
   processes. Therefore, despite an intensive monitoring of catch and
   fishing effort of each vessel, it is still not possible to derive
   reliable estimates for the size of the toothfish population currently
   exploited around the Falkland Islands. Migration patterns in and out of
   the fishery need to be understood before a reliable assessment of the
   fishery can be made. These results, together with current and future
   lines of research, are discussed in the light of data available from
   other toothfish fisheries in austral waters. (C) 1996 The Fisheries

Abstract = {{Changes in the carbohydrate (glucose, trehalose, and glycogen) and total
   protein contents of eggs retained with Heterodera glycines cysts were
   monitored monthly in a field microplot experiment conduced from March
   1993 to March 1995. Treatments included two near-isogenic lines of
   soybean cv. Clark differing for date of maturity, and one corn hybrid.
   The soybean lines were planted in microplots infested with H. glycines
   at a high average initial population density (Pi) (23,810 eggs/100 cm(3)
   soil). and the corn was planted in microplots infested at high (24,640)
   and low (5,485) Pi. Soil temperatures at 15 cm depth and rainfall were
   monitored. Carbohydrate contents varied in the same pattern, with the
   highest levels measured before planting (may) and after harvest
   (October) in both years. Neither Pi nor soybean isoline had an effect on
   any measured response, but the carbohydrate contents of eggs from corn
   and soybean microplots differed during the overwinter (October-May)
   periods (P < 0.0001). Trehalose accumulation was negatively correlated
   with soil temperature (r = -0.78 and r = -0.84, P = 0.0001, July through
   November 1993 and 1994, respectively), which reflects its role as a
   cryoprotectant. In contrast to the pattern for carbohydrates, total
   protein wa slowest before planting and after harvest, and highest (>20
   mu g/1,000 eggs) June through October. Protein content was unaffected by
   plant cultivar or species. Protein and carbohydrate levels in H. glycine
   eggs showed seasonal changes that appeared to be primarily
   temperature-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{The membership of a private golf club in South Carolina's Piedmont
   Physiographic Region was surveyed to determine perceptions regarding
   local black fly populations and the effects of these populations on
   golfing habits. The economic impact of black fly annoyance at this club
   was estimated to be \$27,202. Adult monitoring indicated that the pest
   species were members of the Simulium jenningsi group; larval monitoring
   identified the Enoree Rivet Laurens County, as the primary source of the
   pest species. A localized suppression program was initiated during the
   late summer of 1994 and continued through the fall of 1995. Four
   larvicide applications were conducted in 1994 and 11 in 1995, using the
   biological insecticide Vectobac(R). Larval mortalities of 94.5 and 97\%
   were produced during 1994 and 1995, respectively. Adult black fly
   populations were reduced 92 and 88\% during 1994 and 1995, respectively,
   from pre-program populations. Improvements for future suppression
   programs are proposed.}},

   monitored the presence of reproductively active wasps in the field using
   trap hosts over an 8-week time period in early summer. The overall level
   of recovery of wasps was low (8\% peak parasitism on average), yet, all
   parasitism occurred within one week. Reproductively active B. intermedia
   seemed to be fairly synchronized with gypsy moth pupation, suggesting
   that they might be univoltine and monophagous. However, we cannot
   conclude unequivocally that B. intermedia is monophagous, because these
   wasps appear to disperse readily to other habitats where their behavior

Abstract = {{In the last 100 years, the Dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius has
   disappeared from about half its geographical range in Britain. Evidence
   is presented which indicates that declining range and numbers are due to
   a complex interplay of factors which include fragmentation,
   deterioration and loss of specialized habitat. The Dormouse is unusual
   in being a relatively k-selected small mammal, with exacting ecological
   requirements which render it very vulnerable, particularly to habitat
   fragmentation. The Dormouse is also sensitive to climate, both directly
   and probably indirectly through the effects of weather on the timing and
   abundance of food (insects, flowers and fruits). Combined with low
   population density and low intrinsic rate of population increase, this
   makes the Dormouse highly vulnerable, not just to absolute climatic
   measures (e.g. temperature, rainfall), but especially to climatic
   stochasticity, particularly at the edge of its range. There are strong
   associations between the distribution and changing status of the
   Dormouse and various climatic parameters, and clear parallels with other
   climate-sensitive taxa, notably bats and butterflies.
   The Dormouse is a very specialized species, highly sensitive to
   environmental change, resulting in its piecemeal, progressive
   extinction, particularly in northern counties. It is likely to be a very
   sensitive indicator species for monitoring future changing environments
   and an excellent model for studying the effects of habitat
   fragmentation, climatic shifts and climatic stochasticity.}},

Abstract = {{During the next century, natural and agricultural systems might need to
   adjust to a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and global
   temperature. Evolution of genotypes adapted to this global change could
   play a central role in plants' response. The main purpose of this study
   was to determine the relative importance of phenotypic and genotypic
   responses of plants to global change. To do so, we selected two
   populations of the short-lived Brassica juncea, one under ambient
   conditions and another one under conditions simulating global change.
   After seven generations of selection, differences between the two
   populations were examined using a reciprocal transplant garden. We
   monitored 14 different traits and found evidence for genetic adaptation
   only once, for vegetative biomass early in the growth cycle. Of the 14
   traits, 11 responded plastically to the environment, but only one of
   these plastic changes had a possible adaptive value. Overall, the
   long-term evolutionary consequences of global change will depend on the
   response of fitness-related traits. None of the five reproductive traits
   measured showed any evolutionary responses. The main conclusion of our
   study is that Brassica juncea was apparently unable to respond
   evolutionarily to simulated global change either by genetic adaptation
   or by adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The Limit to selection was
   apparently due to inbreeding depression induced by the harsh conditions
   of the `'predicted'' environment.}},

Abstract = {{Residency and site fidelity of marked populations of the nectar-feeding
   common blossom bat Syconycteris australis were monitored for three years
   in three areas of high food availability (density of Banksia
   integrifolia inflorescences) and three of low food availability on the
   north coast of New South Wales, Australia. Resident bats were present in
   all sites; however, populations in areas with low food abundance were
   more likely to be resident (63\% recaptured) over a six-month flowering
   season than populations in areas with high food abundance (20\%
   recaptured). Residents were more likely to be adult males, than females
   or juveniles. Intruder pressure fluctuated throughout the year with food
   abundance as the number of transients was correlated with the density of
   inflorescences. This had a marked effect on bats in autumn, when a lower
   percentage of residents than transients was reproductive in sites with
   high intruder pressure. Also, residents at sites with high intruder
   pressure were less likely to be reproductive and their body condition
   was lower than residents experiencing low intruder pressure. Thus
   intruder pressure was probably the most important factor reducing
   residency. Nectar and pollen was locally scarce after B. integrifolia
   finished flowering; however, many bats returned to the same site in the
   following year. Site fidelity between consecutive B. integrifolia
   flowering seasons (years), was greater in low-food sites (28\%) than
   areas of high food (12\%). The proximity of non B. integrifolia food
   sources may contribute to the degree of site fidelity, but this is yet
   to be tested. One site was monitored for five consecutive years and at
   least 4\% of those marked in the first year were site faithful after
   five years. Strong site attachment would increase the vulnerability of
   this species to the effects of disturbance. These observations indicate
   that the abundance and dispersion of food has an important influence on
   behaviour and population dynamics of S. australis over long periods.}},

   Numbers subsequently rose again to a total of 139 nests in 1990, but

   mammals. Following the use of a trap and translocation of the animals

   PRA25 granules did not differ from other treatments in disease control,
   indicating that Rhizobium is compatible with biocontrol agents. The
   population dynamics of a fluorescent pseudomonad introduced into the
   rhizosphere in peat or granular formulation was monitored using an
   antibiotic-resistant mutant marker strain. The bacterium in pear
   formulation established a considerably higher population than that in
   granular formulation in 1993 trials, and a slightly higher population in
   1994 trials. The higher population may have been responsible for the
   efficiency of root colonization and the effectiveness of disease
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in physical factors is considered the primary organizational
   force regulating macrobenthic populations and communities of exposed
   sandy beaches. However, there has been no quantitative evaluation of the
   intensity of human predation on the macrofauna inhabiting these systems,
   and information on biological interactions is also lacking. In the
   present study I review the results of a long-term monitoring study on
   the yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides (Deshayes, 1854) (Bivalvia:
   Mesodesmatidae) of an Uruguayan exposed sandy beach, including the
   effect of a human exclusion experiment as a way to acquire knowledge
   about its population structure and dynamics. Experimental management was
   based on the closure of the fishery for 32 months, in which a great part
   of the artisanal fishery community and the coastal marine authorities
   were involved in control operations. The experiment was a useful
   approach to testing the effect of fishing disturbing or altering the
   yellow clam population: the wide range of fishing effort levels through
   time allowed the detection of some patterns and processes that until the
   closure were unknown, namely: (I)the stock recruitment-relationship
   showed overcompensation, i.e. the inhibition of recruitment at highest
   adult densities; (2) growth rates of the newly settled cohorts were
   inversely correlated with the corresponding average adult density: (3)
   post-settlement natural mortality was highest in the densest cohorts,
   and was also a function of fishing activity; (4) the amount of fishing
   effort exerted over Mesodesma mactroides explained variations in
   abundance of the sympatric population of the wedge clam Donax hanleyanus
   Philippi, 1845 (Bivalvia: Donacidae). It is concluded that experimental
   management is a powerful approach to identify factors governing the
   dynamics of exploited sandy beach populations. to acquire the basic
   biological knowledge needed to perform adequate management strategies
   and to quantify the effect of harvesting on other components of the
   macrofauna. It is also stressed that further research in sandy beach
   populations should include human activities as important factors
   affecting long-term trends.}},

Abstract = {{A review is presented about the state of knowledge on the biology,
   fisheries and population dynamics of the anchovy inhabiting the southern
   areas of the Atlantic European coasts, from the Bay of Biscay to the Bay
   of Cadiz. During the current century important and parallel changes in
   the catches on these coasts have occurred. Those changes and the current
   knowledge on interactions between the climatic environment and the
   abundance of the Bay of Biscay anchovy suggest that environment plays a
   key role in determining the evolution of those populations. Bay of
   Biscay anchovy is a good example of a small pelagic species: short life
   span (maximum 3-4 years), seasonal-migrations, intense growth, early
   maturity (at its first birthday), schooling behaviour especially in
   spring at its spawning time and abundant dependent occupation of its
   habitat (spawning area expands at high levels of abundance and
   concentrates at low levels). The large year to year variability in the
   abundance of the populations, according to the changing recruitment,
   makes scientific monitoring and advice on the fishery especially
   difficult. At the moment, no scientific management of these fisheries
   has been implemented by the EU.}},

   trait was conducted during 1991-94. Backcross moths with the sterile
   trait were released in a 16.7-km square area in Washington and Sunflower
   Counties, Mississippi, in 1992 and in Bolivar County in 1993. Pheromone
   traps were used to monitor insect populations in both areas during both
   years and the non-release area served as the control. Moth releases were
   directed at the overwintered tobacco budworm emergence and were placed
   in the field 2 April to 15 May in 1992 and 12 April to 25 May in 1993.
   Approximately 69,000 moths per day were released in 1992 and 70,000 per
   day in 1993. A 3.0:1.0 released:wild ratio was achieved in 1992. This
   ratio dropped to 1.3:1.0 and 1.0:2.3 during June and July, respectively,
   due to moth movement into and out of the release area. Continued
   monitoring of this area in 1993 showed a 1.0:2.2 backcross:wild ratio

   This ratio declined to 1.0:1.6 in June, 1.0:3.6 in July and 1.0:4.0 in

Abstract = {{Pollen dispersal has been recently focused on as a major issue in the
   risk assessment of transgenic crop plants. The shape of the pollen
   dispersal of individual plants is hard to determine since a very large
   number of plants must be monitored in order to track rare long-distance
   dispersal events. Conversely, studies using large plots as a pollen
   source provide a pollen distribution that depends on the shape of the
   source plot. We report here on a method based on the use of Fourier
   transforms by which the pollen dispersal of a single, average individual
   can be obtained from data using large plots as pollen sources, thus
   allowing the estimation of the probability of long-distance dispersal
   for single plants. This method is subsequently implemented on simulated
   data to test its susceptibility to random noise and edge effects. Its
   conditions of application and value for use in ecological studies, in
   particular risk assessment of the deliberate release of transgenic
   plants, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring the distribution of a rare mammal presents obvious challenges
   to wildlife biologists. We evaluated the use of mitochondrial DNA
   extracted from fecal pellets and tissue samples as a possible method to
   track declining populations of New England cottontails (Sylvilagus
   transitionalis) in a region where they are sympatric with eastern
   cottontails (S. floridanus). We identified a species-specific
   restriction site that consistently differentiated the 2 cottontails. Our
   ability to extract DNA from fecal-pellet samples was hampered by large
   amounts of plant pigments; therefore, we recommend that biologists rely
   on tissue samples to conduct regional surveys on the relative abundance
   and distribution of New England cottontails. DNA-based techniques have
   advantages over current methods used to identify New England cottontails
   (skull morphology, determination of diploid chromosome numbers, and
   chromosomal banding pattern) because they rely on small samples that can
   be collected using a variety of protocols (e.g., cooperating hunters and
   incidental vehicle mortalities).}},

Abstract = {{Field tests on the colour response of Austroasca viridigrisea adults
   were conducted using square (30 x 30 cm) coloured sticky traps placed in
   a cotton field. Among the colours tested, adults were attracted most to
   yellow traps emitting light in the 500-600 nm region (peak reflectance
   at 560 nm), followed by green and orange, then red, deep blue, black,
   magenta and true blue. Dilution of yellow with white to produce
   yellow-white hues resulted in a significant decline in A. viridigrisea
   captures. Reflectance spectra of painted surfaces of enamel colours and
   also traps with different hues of yellow indicated that A. viridigrisea
   capture rates were directly related to the amount of light reflected in
   the 500-600 nm zone, the wavelength at which peak reflectance of green
   plants occurs. This positive behavioural response of A. viridigrisea to
   yellow suggests that the leafhopper can discriminate foliage-like hues
   (500-580 nm) from non foliage-like hues (< 500 nm and > 580 nm) and
   therefore could detect herbaceous foliage on the basis of colour.
   Significantly higher numbers of adults were caught at heights between
   25-75 cm than at 100, 125 and 150 cm above ground level. To monitor
   fright phenology and populations of A. viridigrisea, yellow sticky traps
   should be placed at heights between 25 and 75 cm above ground level.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of environmental and human exposure to mercury in the Nungwe
   Bay area of the Lake Victoria goldfields, Tanzania, has revealed low

   background levels. Gold mining has not produced a significant increase
   in environmental methylmercury that is available for bioaccummulation in
   aquatic food chains. Urinary mercury levels in gold mine workers
   frequently exposed to Hg vapour in amalgamation and burning of amalgam
   were significantly higher (mean: 241 ng/ml) than those in the general
   mine population not occupational exposed to Hg (mean: 2.6 ng/ml).
   Rotation of mine duties reduced Hg exposure levels and hence the risk of
   intoxication in the gold mine workers. The lowest urinary and hair
   mercury levels were found in the Nungwe Bay fishing village population.
   This was consistent with the low mercury content of fish consumed by the
   inhabitants of the Nungwe Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular tools have diver se applications in marine ecology. In
   microbial systems, DNA sequences of rRNA and other genes have identified
   a variety of novel lineages of bacteria inhabiting marine environments
   that have resisted traditional culture methods. However, relatively few
   natural populations have been characterized due to the rather
   labor-intensive methodologies employed. Recent technological
   developments such as in situ PCR and flow cytometry promise to greatly
   enhance the speed at which microbial taxa can be identified and
   enumerated in field collected water and substrate samples; such advances
   will allow future work to employ the spatial and temporal field sampling
   required to monitor the impact of natural and anthropogenic changes in
   the environment. This approach also holds promise for examining
   physiological status of field collected cells, garnering information on
   such elusive parameters as growth rates and the extent of nutrient
   limitation under natural conditions. Studies of macrobiota have
   similarly benefited from the use of molecular approaches to species
   identification. This has been particularly true with regard to
   distinguishing among larval forms of closely related taxa which are
   nearly identical morphologically. Genetic variation within species
   assayed by molecular tools has been useful in examining the stability of
   populations through time and in assessing patterns of recruitment to
   geographically separated populations. Enhanced understanding of these
   ecological problems will also require intensive spatial and temporal
   monitoring of both larval and adult populations. Often, the newer
   techniques based on DNA sequence variation have practical advantages
   over allozyme techniques: e.g., PCR allows assay of minute quantities of
   DNA that may come from ethanol preserved samples. However, when ample
   allozyme variation exists to address a given issue, these older
   techniques may be favored on a variety of criteria, including spaed and
   cost. Hence, choice of methodology should be based on the expected
   efficiency of a given approach to a specific problem rather than the
   apparent sophistication of the method itself.}},

Abstract = {{(E)-11,13-Tetradecadienal (E11,13-14:Ald) is the major component of the
   sex pheromone of the western blackheaded budworm (WEB), Acleris
   gloverana Walsingham. The compound was identified in extracts of the
   female's pheromone gland by coupled gas chromatographic -
   electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and coupled GC - mass
   spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode. In field experiments,
   E11,13-14:Ald by itself was attractive, but addition of
   (Z)-11,13-tetradecadienal doubled trap catches of male WEB.
   (E)-11,13-Tetradecadienol or (E)-11,13-tetradecadienyl acetate in binary
   or ternary combination with E11,13-14:Ald did not enhance attractiveness
   of the bait. In comparative assessments of five different trap designs,
   Uni-traps appeared to be the most suitable for use in pheromone-based
   monitoring of populations of WEB.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of juvenile sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) were
   released on the sea bed in summer and winter at two sites (a
   topographically open and an enclosed site) along the southwestern coast
   of Nova Scotia, Canada. Seeded and wild scallops and their predators
   (sea stars Asterias vulgaris and A. forbesi and rack crab Cancer
   irroratus) were monitored by video and diver surveys over 17 mo.
   Following release, the density of seeded scallops rapidly decreased, and
   stabilized after 1-8 wk; variation in final densities was greater
   between sites than between seasons of seeding. Seasonal temperature
   affected the rate at which the final densities were attained. Seeding
   effectively doubled scallop density at each site. Survivorship was
   similar to 10\% due to loss from crab predation and dispersion of seeded
   scallops at the open site and similar to 1\% due to mainly crab
   predation at the enclosed site. Temporal variation in abundance and
   spatial distribution of predators was not correlated with that of seeded
   scallops, suggesting that predatory mortality of seeded scallops was due
   to a functional response, rather than an aggregative response of
   predators. Growth of seeded scallops was similar at both sites. The
   dynamics of the seeded scallop populations reflected the interaction of
   predation, dispersion, and growth.}},

Abstract = {{Macroepifaunal populations near three active gas-producing platforms
   were studied as part of the Gulf of Mexico Offshore Operations
   Monitoring Experiment (GOOMEX) using a near-field (50-100 m), far-field
   (3 km) collection strategy. When differences in catch per unit effort
   (CPUE) existed, they were species and site specific. Size effects were
   not solely due to sexual dimorphism. Differences in size and abundance
   did not covary. General responses to the presence of platform structure
   or other characteristics common to gas-producing platforms were not
   observed. CPUE was site (platform) specific, indicating that epifauna
   responded to the unique physical and chemical characteristics of each
   platform. The frequency of significant near-field/far-field differences
   declined with increasing depth as did the frequency of significant
   seasonal and time-of-collection differences in size and CPUE, suggesting
   that platforms affect adjacent community structure more strongly in
   shallow water and that seasonality and behavior patterns may be
   important promoters of this effect. Significant differences occurred no
   less frequently in the most mobile species (penaeid shrimp) than in the
   much less mobile starfish and scallops. Accordingly, discrete
   populations of mobile epifauna maintain their coherence for significant
   periods, which permits differential effects produced by nearness to
   platforms to be expressed in some of the most mobile invertebrates on
   the shelf.}},

Abstract = {{A Sediment Quality Triad approach was used to integrate concurrently
   obtained toxicological, sediment contaminant, and benthic ecological
   data from GOOMEX in a test of coherence of responses. The biological
   community responded to contaminants by increases in the ratio of `'the
   more tolerant taxon'' to `'the more sensitive taxon'': the nematode to
   harpacticoid copepod ratio for meiofauna and the polychaete to amphipod
   ratio for macrofauna. Meiofaunal total abundance declined near platforms
   whereas macrofaunal total abundance increased - probably because of
   organic enrichment near platforms. A second approach used small-scale
   spatial heterogeneity of response as evidence of impact. Cd, Ba, ChemPC1
   (first principal component of contaminant information), and the nematode
   to harpacticoid ratio had significant heterogeneity of variance among
   distances from platform, with higher variances near platforms. The
   pattern for Cd and ChemPC1 suggests that the impact may extend out to
   200 m. We argue that differing objectives which are often demanded of
   the same study are often in conflict (e.g., generalization about
   environmental impact of similar platforms has different design
   requirements than description of spatial pattern of impact around each
   platform). Therefore, requiring that a study accomplish both objectives
   leads to compromises and a suboptimal design for both.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews parametric empirical Bayes (FEB) methods and their
   application to ecological data. One of the main objections to Bayesian
   statistics is the `'subjectivity'' caused by specifying parameters.
   Attempting to remove that subjectivity, the FEB philosophy uses the
   Bayesian mathematical framework. but then estimates, rather than
   specifies, all unknown parameters. Three examples are given to
   illustrate FEB methods. The first is a FEB analysis for monitoring the
   yearly population of harbor seals, the second uses simulated data and
   shows how a FEB analysis combines single capture-recapture estimates,
   and the third is a FEB method for spatial patch analysis of data from a
   transect through grassland vegetation. From the examples, the general
   methodology and philosophy of a FEB analysis are explained.}},

Abstract = {{Fishers (Martes pennanti) and American martens (M. anericana) have been
   protected from trapping in California since the mid-1900s, yet in
   portions of each of their historic ranges their numbers are extremely
   low, perhaps due to the effects of timber harvest. We propose a method
   capable of detecting declines in the occurrence and distribution of
   fishers or martens using baited track-plate stations. The proposed
   sampling unit is a small grid of stations that has a high probability of
   detecting animals when they are present. These multistation units are
   sufficiently spaced to meet the assumption of independence for a
   binomial model. We propose a stratified random sampling design with
   strata sampled for proportions of occurrence at discrete points in time.
   Stratification is based on variation in occurrence by region and is
   estimated from preliminary survey data. A previously published bias
   adjustment is applied to the proportion of units with detections to
   adjust for possible failure to detect resident individuals at a sampling
   unit. A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to determine the
   sample size necessary to detect 20 and 50\% declines, with 80\% power,
   in the proportion of sampling units with occurrence. We assume a 10-yr
   sampling interval. Sensitivity analysis, using a range of values for
   means and standard deviations of strata proportions, determined that
   power was much more sensitive to changes in mean than the standard
   deviation. When the best current estimates of the fisher strata
   proportions were input for 10 strata (five regional and two habitat) in
   California, 115 and 17 sampling units per stratum were necessary to
   detect 20 and 50\% declines, respectively. For some circumstances this
   sampling effort was also sufficient to achieve strata estimates with 5\%
   error and to detect statistical differences between individual stratum
   proportions. The steps in the process of implementing a monitoring
   program for Pacific fishers in California are outlined as an example of
   the planning and preparation necessary to monitor changes in the
   distribution of a rare forest carnivore.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms that live in highly variable environments, such as rivers,
   rely on adaptations to withstand and recover from disturbance. These
   adaptations include behavioral traits, such as habitat preference and
   plasticity of reproductive timing, that minimize the effects of
   discharge fluctuation. Studies linking hydrologic regime, habitat
   preference, and population processes, however, are predominantly limited
   to fish. Information on other sensitive taxa is necessary to facilitate
   conservation of multispecies assemblages and restoration of biodiversity
   in degraded river channels.
   I studied the functional relationship between physical habitat and
   reproduction of the foothills yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii), a
   California State Species of Special Concern. From 1992 to 1994, I mapped
   breeding sites along 5.3 km of the South Fork Eel River in northern
   California and monitored egg survival to hatching. Frogs selected sites
   over a range of spatial scales and timed their egg-laying to avoid
   fluctuations in river stage and current velocity associated with changes
   in discharge. The main sources of mortality were desiccation and
   subsequent predation of eggs in a dry year and scour from substrate in
   wet years, both caused by changes in stage and velocity. At the finest
   spatial scale, frogs attached eggs to cobbles and boulders at lower than
   ambient flow velocities. At larger scales, breeding sites were near
   confluences of tributary drainages and were located in wide, shallow
   reaches. Clutches laid in relatively narrower and deeper channels had
   poor survival in rainy as well as dry springs. Most breeding sites were
   used repeatedly, despite between- and within-year variation in spring
   stage of the river. This pattern of site selection suggests that
   conservation of Rana boylii may be enhanced by maintaining or restoring
   channels with shapes that provide stable habitat over a range of river
   stages.}},

Abstract = {{1. The arrival of the chrysomelid beetle Trirhabda virgata on isolated
   patches of its host Solidago altissima was closely monitored to
   determine how conspecific density and host condition influence
   colonization.
   2. Experimental host patches, which were set on the roof of a
   four-storey building located 0.7 km from the nearest naturally occurring
   hosts, were frequently colonized by beetles over a 2-week dispersal
   period.
   3. Females preferred lush host patches that were free from simulated
   Trirhabda chewing damage, Females colonized lush patches more often than
   defoliated patches at two spatial scales, when patches were 2 m and 25 m
   apart. Males did not show a strong preference fur lush plants.
   4. Males aggregated on plants that already contained adult conspecifics,
   apparently increasing their reproductive success. Females did not
   respond to the presence of adults on the patch.
   5. Ninety-five per cent of the females arriving on the isolated plants
   had mated before flying, indicating that lone females are able to
   colonize empty stands.
   6. By avoiding heavily defoliated plants, females should dissipate local
   outbreaks and spread their offspring away from over-exploited areas.}},

Year = {{1996}},

Abstract = {{Thirteen species from the red algal Bora of Helgoland (southern North
   Sea) were exposed to UVA + UVB radiation for various periods in the
   laboratory, and dark-adapted variable fluorescence (F-v: F-m) was
   measured immediately after the UV treatment and again after various
   recovery times in white light. With the exception of Porphyra
   umbilicalis, all species showed a decrease in F-v: F-m on exposure to UV
   radiation followed by recovery towards the initial values during the
   next 24-48 h in white light. The rate of the initial decrease was
   greater, and the extent of recovery was less, in deep subtidal species
   (e.g. Delesseria sanguinea, Plocamium cartilagineum) than in intertidal
   or shallow subtidal species, although there was no direct correlation
   between these indicators of sensitivity to UV radiation and the depth
   range of a species, and only slight differences were detected between
   populations of a single species collected from different depths. There
   was also little evidence of a seasonal change in sensitivity to UV
   radiation in Delesseria or Plocamium. The decrease in variable
   fluorescence in Delesseria and Plocamium was proportional to the
   logarithm of the exposure to UV radiation, and reciprocity between
   irradiance and the length of irradiation appeared to hold for up to 16
   h. The exposure to WA that reduced F-v: F-m by 50\% ('50\% exposure')
   immediately after the treatment was about 10 kJ m(-2) for both
   Delesseria and Plocamium, but Plocamium appeared to recover more rapidly
   than Delesseria because the 50\% exposure after 24 h recovery was about
   37 kJ m(-2) for Delesseria compared with 70-120 kJ m(-2) for different
   populations of Plocamium. The removal of UVB from the UV radiation
   treatments had no detectable effect on the inhibition of F-v: F-m in
   either Delesseria or a deep-water population of Plocamium, but reduced
   the inhibition by 30-50\% in a shallow-water population of Plocamium.
   When only half an intact blade of Delesseria was exposed to UV
   radiation, variable fluorescence was reduced in the irradiated half but
   was completely unaffected in the unirradiated half, and steep gradients
   of F-v: F-m values were measured which persisted for over 48 h after the
   irradiation treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Biological monitoring in the Dutch Wadden Sea between November 1993 and
   July 1994 revealed Pseudo-nitzschia-like pennate chain-forming diatom
   species with cell numbers ranging from 10(2) to 10(5) per litre.
   Cultured isolates and field samples were examined by electron
   microscopy, which revealed the majority to be Pseudo-nitzschia pungens.
   This species dominated over other diatoms in the phytoplankton
   population during November 1993 and at the end of June 1994. At the
   beginning of June 1994, P. fraudulenta was also present; occasionally,
   P. delicatissima was observed. One isolate showed the characteristic
   morphology of P. multiseries. Species-specific polyclonal antibodies and
   large-subunit (LSU) rRNA-targeted oligonucleotides for North American
   strains of P. multiseries and P. pungens applied to the European
   isolates, confirmed species designations based on electron microscopy.
   The isolate of P. multiseries from the Dutch Wadden Sea produced domoic
   acid; after 55 days of growth about 19 pg per cell was measured This is
   the first report of a domoic acid-producing P. multiseries isolated from
   European coastal waters.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of unfed males and females of six species of African ticks
   was monitored at five different saturation deficits at constant
   temperature (25 degrees C). The survivorship curves for each species
   comprised a pre-mortality period, prior to when ticks started to die and
   a mortality period corresponding to a rapid increase in the mortality
   rate. Longevity was defined as pre-mortality plus mortality. A negative
   correlation between the longevity of the ticks and the saturation
   deficits was found with ticks surviving longer at lower deficits. The
   survival of males and females was similar. At low saturation deficits
   (2-4 mmHg) Amblyomma hebraeum survived the longest periods (74 weeks).
   Some correlation was found between the tick survival under dehydrating
   conditions and habitat associations. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and
   Haemaphysalis leachii, the most mesic in distribution, had the shortest
   longevity (21 and 13 weeks, respectively) at high saturation deficits
   (7-21 mmHg). Hyalomma marginatum rufipes, the most xerophilic in
   distribution, had the longest survival (39.3 +/- 10.5 weeks) at high
   saturation deficits. Other factors apart from the adult survival should
   be taken into account when accounting for the tick distribution, in
   particular the tolerance of earlier developmental stages to desiccation.}},

Abstract = {{Little Mere, a small shallow lake, has been monitored for four years,
   since its main source of nutrients (sewage effluent) was diverted. The
   lake has provided strong evidence for the persistence of a dear water
   state over a wide range of nutrient concentrations. It had clear water
   at extremely high nutrient concentrations prior to effluent diversion,
   associated with high densities of the large body-sized grazer, Daphnia
   magna, associated with low fish densities and fish predation. Following
   sewage effluent diversion in 1991, the nutrient concentrations
   significantly declined, the oxygen concentrations rose, and fish
   predation increased. The dominance of large body-sized grazers shifted
   to one of relatively smaller body-sized animals but the clear water
   state has been maintained. This is probably due to provision of refuges
   for grazers by large nymphaeid stands (also found prior to diversion).
   There has been a continued decrease in nutrient concentrations and
   expansion of the total macrophyte coverage, largely by submerged plants,
   following effluent diversion. The grazer community of Little Mere has
   also responded to this latter change with a decline in daphnids and
   increase in densities of weed-associated grazers. The presence of large
   densities of such open water grazers was the apparent main buffer
   mechanisms of the clear water state until 1994. The lake has, so far,
   maintained its clear water in the absence of such grazers. Thus, new
   buffer mechanisms appear to operate to stabilize the ecosystem. Little
   Mere appears to have shifted from previous top-down controlled clear
   water state to a bottom-up controlled clear water state.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental and monitoring studies done in soft-sediments are made
   difficult by the need to disrupt physically the structure of the habitat
   in order to sample the biota, which often lives buried beneath the
   surface. Collection of a sample causes some disturbance as sediment
   moves to fill the hole left by the removed core or grab, possibly
   exposing animals in the surrounding sediment to predators. Physical
   disturbance from sampling may also disrupt microbial assemblages in the
   sediments or breakdown biotic structures which help bind the sediments
   leg. animals tubes, roots and rhizomes or microbial mars). An experiment
   was done specifically to test the hypothesis that disturbance from
   repeated sampling in soft-sediments leads to artifacts which affect
   subsequent estimates of the structure of populations and assemblages.
   Repeated sampling of the same patches is often necessary due to the
   logistical constraints of establishing experiments in soft-sediments.
   The results of the experiment demonstrate the potential for disturbance
   from previous sampling to affect the abundance and species richness of
   molluscan assemblages in soft-sediments. After two weeks, there were
   still detectable differences between patches of sediment which had been
   initially disturbed to simulate the collection of samples, and control
   (undisturbed) patches. The results were not consistent between the two
   sites used for the experiment, nor between the two levels of initial
   disturbance applied, suggesting that artifacts from repeated sampling
   cannot be considered as being `equal' across all treatments. Where
   repeated sampling of the same patches is required, the potential for
   artifacts should be addressed to determine how these may affect
   interpretation of the results from experiments or sampling programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Survival of Aeromonas salmonicida was monitored during prolonged
   incubation in either distilled water or lake water. Culturability was
   determined from colony forming units enumerated on tryptone soy agar,
   whilst flow cytometry was used for direct analysis of viable cells after
   staining with fluorescent dyes which differentially stained bacteria in
   relation to defined cellular properties. Over time, populations of
   culturable cells steadily declined and were not detected after 10 days
   incubation in distilled water or 33 days in lake water. Flow cytometric
   analysis revealed that cellular properties related to viability were
   lost shortly after culturable cells became undetectable in distilled
   water. In contrast, those incubated in lake water showed little change
   in these properties over a 57-day experimental period. The implications
   of these differences are discussed, and it is concluded that A.
   salmonicida is capable of remaining intact and active upon prolonged
   incubation in lake water, although this does not conclusively prove
   viability.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the dietary response of pumas (Puma concolor) to a
   population decline of the plains vizcacha (Lagostomus maximus), and
   compared the diet of pumas in semi-arid scrub of Argentina to predicted
   patterns based on a biogeographic analysis of the diet of this species
   throughout the Americas, Feces of pumas were collected in Lihue Calel
   National Park in 1985-1988 and in 1994, and populations of vizcachas
   were monitored during the same period by direct observation of marked
   animals and burrow surveys. Vizcachas were the most abundant prey in
   feces of pumas during all years and composed 51.6-84.9\% of the diet,
   During 1986-1994, the population of vizcachas declined >90\% in Lihue
   Calel National Park, and greater than or equal to 14\% on surrounding
   ranches. The proportion of vizcachas in feces of pumas declined by 33\%,
   and consumption of ungulates increased. Weight of prey and breadth of
   diet of pumas were lower in our study site than in almost all other
   areas in North and South America. We hypothesize that pumas are
   selectively foraging on vizcachas because this species provides a
   clumped resource that is spatially predictable, easy to handle, and, at
   times, abundant.}},

Abstract = {{Emergence and survival of seedlings of lotus or narrowleaf trefoil
   (Lotus tenuis Waldst) were monitored in 4 grazed pastures dominated by
   tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb,) for 2 successive years, The
   objective was to detect patterns and environmental conditions promoting
   successful seedling establishment of lotus, Emergence followed a
   seasonal pattern each year, with most emergence occurring towards the
   end of winter, Seedling emergence occurred mainly in heavily grazed
   sites which occupied 45 to 90\% of each pasture, Seedling emergence was
   greatest, but seedling survival was poorest in the wettest year,
   Competition resulting from climatic conditions favoring growth of
   established pasture plants was detrimental to establishment of lotus
   seedlings, In contrast, heavily grazed areas provided microsites that
   enhanced survival of new recruits during the spring growing season,
   Dense seedling stands emerging on feces were overcrowded and suffered
   the highest mortality, thus, they contributed Little to recruitment of
   lotus, However, dispersal of lotus was enhanced by the presence of seeds
   in livestock feces.}},

Abstract = {{This study is the first systematic attempt to use oxygen and carbon
   isotopes in modern brachiopods to investigate seasonality and growth
   rates. A comparison of oxygen-isotope analyses of shells of living
   specimens of Laqueus californianus dredged from 80 and 130 m off Santa
   Catalina Island, California, to available hydrographic data indicates
   that this articulate brachiopod secretes its shell in or close to oxygen
   isotopic equilibrium with ambient seawater. Periodic oxygen-isotope
   depletions appear to result from EI Nino events. Unexpectedly low
   delta(13)C values associated with the 1983 El Nino may be explained by
   increased bacterial activity or organic loading into the Southern
   California Eight associated with these warm-water pulses. Growth rates
   determined from annual cycles in delta(18)O records are variable, but
   generally average between 2 and 3 mm yr(-1) for mature individuals.
   Because of the longevity of L. californianus, O-18 profiles provide
   high-resolution seasonal temperature records spanning one to two
   decades. Our data suggest that oxygen isotopes in brachiopod shells can
   be utilized as monitors of environmental change in the subeuphotic zone.}},

Abstract = {{The sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test is a widely used method to
   detect chemically induced genetic damage. This method has been applied
   in some aquatic species to monitor genetic pollutants in estuarine and
   marine environments. Dose response to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was
   investigated in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. Experimental
   assays were carried out by incorporating 4, 10, 20 and 40 mu g ml(-1)
   BrdU in asynchronously growing mussel gill cell populations. SCE
   frequency was dose dependent both for mussel cells labelled with BrdU
   for a first round of replication followed by a second round without BrdU
   (24+36 h), and for mussel cells labelled with BrdU for 2 consecutive
   rounds of replication (60 h). For every dose assayed, significant
   differences in SCE frequencies were also found between these 2 kinds of
   BrdU treatments. The relationship between the duration of the BrdU
   treatment and the frequency of SCEs was also investigated in M.
   galloprovincialis. We tested the effect of in vivo BrdU incorporation
   for either the first cell cycle, or the first and second cell cycles in
   mussel gill cells. This paper shows that SCE frequencies remain constant
   for the different BrdU exposures (12+36, 12+48, 24+24, 24+36 and 36+24
   h) assayed to obtain first cell cycle labelling, but a striking increase
   was noted in BrdU treatments (48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 h) for 2 consecutive
   cycles of labelling. A monthly study of SCE frequencies occurring in 2
   natural populations from NW Spain was also performed during 1993.
   Significant differences in the frequency of SCE were detected both
   between populations and among months in the mussel populations. In most
   of the cases, noticeable interindividual variations in SCE frequencies
   were detected in mussels exposed to the same BrdU conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Observations along the north coast of Jamaica in 1994 suggested that
   areas of relatively high coral cover and high coral diversity occurred
   adjacent to reefs that have been in decline since 1980. This study was
   carried out to quantify these observations, to determine whether similar
   variation occurs elsewhere in the Caribbean, and to draw attention to
   the significance of kilometer-wide variation in coral reef community
   ecology. The fore reef (10 m depth) of Discovery Bay, Jamaica, had <3\%
   coral cover, 12 species of scleractinians and >60\% macroalgae cover and
   appeared typical of a highly degraded Caribbean reef. However,
   neighboring reefs (<9 km away) in the same reef zone and at the same
   depth had up to 19 species of scleractinians, significantly higher coral
   cover (5 to 23\%) and lower macroalgae cover (10 to 39\%). Three reefs
   along the south coast of St. John, US Virgin Islands (10 m depth), which
   are protected within a National park, displayed comparable
   kilometer-wide variation in coral cover (3 to 33\%) and macroalgae cover
   (22 to 33\%). The abundance of juvenile corals also displayed similar
   levels of kilometer-wide variation within both islands; These results
   demonstrate that several measures of coral reef community structure are
   highly variable over a spatial scale of kilometers; further study of
   these patterns may prove valuable in discerning the causes and
   consequences of coral demise. The existence of such large-scale
   variation emphasizes the importance of careful choice of sampling scale
   in the design and interpretation of monitoring programs in community
   ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Metal concentrations in individual oysters were estimated in order to
   assess the among-individuals metal variability In a geographically
   confined area. American oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were collected
   from three sites on the Potomac River, Maryland, and the soft tissues of
   individuals was analysed for Ag, Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn. At all sites
   metal concentrations were highly variable with the coefficient of
   variation (CV) between 15 and 55\%, the three site mean increasing as
   follows: Fe; Cd; Ni; Zn; Pb; Ag; Cu. Excluding Pb, the analytical
   contribution to the total variance was about 2\%. Bootstrap analysis, a
   statistical resampling procedure with replacement, was used to estimate
   population parameters for pooled samples. Simulated sampling of 10 000
   pooled samples verified that the sampling error decreases significantly
   with increasing numbers of individuals per pool. The confidence interval
   of means for samples consisting of 20 oysters varied from +/-5\% to
   +/-20\% (p<0.05), depending on metal and site. The confidence interval
   of means increased by a factor of approximately 1.5 when 10 individuals
   were used instead of 20, and decreased by a factor of 0.6 when 50
   oysters were used per pooled sample. These results indicate that if
   analyses of individuals are precluded, increased size of pooled samples
   is a low cost option for increasing the ability of monitoring programmes
   to detect changes in environmental contaminants. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{An aerobiological monitoring programme was carried out for over a pear
   on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, Antarctica. Collections were made
   using arrays of rotorod samplers at three sites. Lichen soredia were
   found to be the most abundant air borne propagules, more so than
   ascospores, the sexual propagules of lichen fungi. The dominance of
   soredia over ascospores appeared to decrease with increasing maturity of
   fellfield sites. No correlations were found with temperature, relative
   humidity or wind speed. Collections at 1 m above ground level were shown
   not to be significantly different to those at 0.15 m at two Of the
   sites. Size range distribution also differed at two of the sites.
   Soredial clumps in excess of 100 mu m in diameter were collected at 1 m
   above ground level and at some distance from potential source plants,
   though most fell in the range 30-60 mu m. Peaks in numbers of air borne
   soredia were found after winter snow melt, demonstrating that soredial

Abstract = {{This research examined the roles that algal populations, as sources of
   dissolved organic material (DOC), and water quality play in DOC removal
   during ozonation and coagulation processes. Algal monocultures were
   grown as suspensions in continuous-flow reactors to simulate bloom
   conditions and to provide a distinct type of DOC for treatment
   experiments. Jar tests were conducted with and without preozonation to
   assess DOC removal as a function of algal source, coagulant type and
   dose, pH and bicarbonate concentration. Overall, algal-derived DOC was
   difficult to remove; high coagulant doses were required and removal was
   strongly influenced by solution pH and algal source. Preozonation
   enhanced DOC removal to varying degrees depending on organic quality
   which was determined by the algal source. These results suggest that the
   unpredictable nature of ozone's ability to enhance coagulation in actual
   treatment practice may be related to changes in DOC caused by seasonal
   shifts in algal speciation and dominance. The technique of Pyrolysis
   (PY)-GC-MS was employed to explore the chemical basis for these
   differences in treatment performance. Preozonation produced dramatic
   changes in the chemical character of the organic matrix produced by
   algae as revealed by PY-GC-MS. These results suggest that, although use
   of ozone may not improve DOC removals in all cases, there may be
   advantages to ozone use which are related to desirable quality changes
   in the residual DOC. Furthermore, these results illustrate that PY-GC-MS
   is a powerful technique with which to characterize and monitor changes
   in organic quality so as to better understand chemical interactions in
   treatment. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of urban air pollution are usually confined to a few
   locations within a city area. Monitoring stations are often situated in
   streets with significant traffic levels or in places where severe
   pollution problems are expected. Such measurements are naturally
   influenced by very local conditions and care must be taken in
   interpreting the results. This is especially important when the
   measurements are used for estimating urban air pollution levels or
   comparing air quality in different cities. Another frequent application
   of street measurements is for public information or warning the
   population of elevated pollution levels. Estimating the dangers of
   long-term exposure to air pollution means careful consideration must be
   given to how representative these measurements actually are. In this
   paper the influence of local conditions on air pollution concentrations
   is discussed, regarding especially the dependency of pollution levels on
   street configuration and meteorolgical parameters. The examples used are
   based on measurements from locations in Copenhagen and on model
   calculations using the Danish Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM).
   It is shown that large concentration gradients can occur in street
   canyons with leeward concentrations far higher than windward
   concentrations. Thus, street measurements are site-dependent and not
   representative for urban areas. Model calculations with OSPM agree well
   with measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in sediment oxygen demand, sulfate reduction rates, and sulfate
   reducing bacteria (SRB) abundances were monitored in nine 0.04-0.08 ha
   earthen shrimp ponds during a 17-week growing season, Organic matter
   (feed) was added at two rates (standard and high) in a block design. The
   aquaculture site was located in an inland region and utilized saline
   groundwater of lower total dissolved salts and a proportionally higher
   sulfate concentration than undiluted seawater, Sediment oxygen demand
   was measured in situ in an enclosed chamber, sulfate reduction rates
   were measured in cores using injected (SO42-)-S-35, and SRB counts were
   estimated using most probable number analyses. Over the growing season,
   sediment oxygen demand increased four-fold, SRB populations increased by
   more than one order of magnitude, and sulfate reduction rates increased
   over two orders of magnitude, with the highest values occurring at the
   end of the season. Sulfide flux measurements within chambers
   demonstrated that sulfide re-oxidation represented a greater proportion
   of sediment oxygen demand at the end of the season (mean 84\%) than at
   the beginning (< 2\%). Sediment porewater sulfate concentrations were
   high at all depths (24.7-31.0 mM) and did not appear to limit sulfate
   reduction. Sediment profiles showed a reasonably strong correlation
   between organic matter content and sulfate reduction rates (r(2) =
   0.66). Furthermore, significant differences (P < 0.05) in sulfate
   reduction were found between ponds that had been used for aquaculture in
   the previous season versus newly constructed ponds, Differences were
   consistent with the hypothesis that sulfate reduction was regulated by
   organic matter quantity and reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{The colonization of littoral macroalgae by meiofaunal Acari on the
   sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia was studied using spun-Nylon pan
   scourers as artificial substrata. A total of twelve species of littoral
   Acari, including two Rhodacaridae, four Halacaridae, three Podacaridae
   and three Hyadesiidae, were collected from the scourers. Rhombognathus
   auster, R. plumifer (Halacaridae), Halozetes littoralis, H. marinus
   (Podacaridae) and Hyadesia subantarctica (Hyadesiidae) rapidly establish
   their dominance in spring and remain ascendant throughout the summer.
   Predation and competition have minimal impact on the mite populations
   compared with abiotic (climatic) influences. Low winter temperatures
   exert an indirect pressure by killing most of the algal substrata, while
   storms have a more direct effect by removing both mites and algae from
   the shore. Surviving mites over-winter in the shelter afforded by
   crevices and among the basal portions of enduring algae.}},

Abstract = {{Marginality describes the impact that environmental and landscape
   factors have in decreasing the probability of population survival and
   persistence. It may be imposed by extreme conditions or resource
   scarcity. Typically, it affects populations at the range edge but can
   also affect populations within the core of ranges, and produces a number
   of symptoms: characteristically demographic, but also morphological,
   physiological, biochemical and genetic. In this paper, the causes and
   effects of marginality on British butterflies are compared in edge and
   centre of range populations. Issues of temporal and spatial scales are
   examined, as is the relevance of marginality to the conservation of
   single and multiple species populations. The recognition of marginality
   questions the appropriateness of many so-called spatially realistic
   models of populations and highlights areas of research which have
   hitherto been ignored. Projected changes in land use and climate have
   implications for marginality in core and peripheral populations; in view
   of this, current scales of mapping are found to be unsuitable for
   monitoring fragmentation and the increasing marginalization of butterfly
   species in the British landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Isopods are members of the soil fauna important in decomposition. Their
   role in the decomposition of leaf litter in forest soils has been
   reported for many years (Gere 1956; Griffiths et al. 1989). Isopods are
   reported to contain high concentrations of copper in their haemolymph
   (70 mg/ml) and in hepatopancreas (216 mg/g d.w.) (Gunnarson and Hedlund
   1987). The role that copper plays in the physiology and ecology of
   terrestrial isopods was first examined in detail by Wieser (1966, 1968),
   Dallinger (1977) and Dallinger and Wieser (1977). Furthermore, Wieser
   (1966, 1968) and Wieser et al. (1976) showed that copper concentrations
   of terrestrial isopods reflect the degree of environmental soil and
   litter contamination. In the last decade, pollution of the environment
   with heavy metals has led many environmental scientists to search for
   suitable methods to monitor distribution and effects of such pollution.
   Laboratory tests using terrestrial isopods are recommended for assessing
   the ecotoxicological effects of chemicals (Drobne and Hopkin 1994).
   Isopods are able to accumulate large amounts of several metals in their
   hepatopancreas (Hopkin 1989, 1990) therefore they are useful biological
   indicators of metal pollution (Dallinger et al. 1992). Because of its
   worldwide distribution and the high metal accumulation capacity, Hopkin
   et al. (1993) proposed that Porcellio scaber could be a suitable
   `'bioindicator'' of metal contaminated soils.
   In spite of the fact that copper is an essential metal in isopods, it
   may become toxic if it Is highly concentrated in the environment
   (Dallinger 1977; Dallinger and Wieser 1977), or released from the
   degraded haemocyanin (Gunnarson and Hedlund 1987) during a long period
   of starvation. The accumulation, metabolism, storage, detoxication and
   excretion of copper in isopods have been examined previously (Hopkin
   1989). However, detailed information on the sublethal effects of copper
   in isopods and the influence of the nutritional status on the copper
   toxicity are sparse.
   In this paper we describe the effects of high concentrations of copper
   on consumption, growth rates and on reproduction correlates
   (gravids/females, offsping/females) applied in different foods to
   Porcellio scaber using a standard laboratory method.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding bird community in Denali National Park, Alaska, was studied
   over a three-year period (1993-1995). Birds were surveyed from nine
   off-road routes in spruce forests from 1993-1995 and from four on-road
   routes in 1994 and 1995. Thirty-nine species were detected during
   off-road routes, whereas 80 species were detected from on-road routes.
   The most abundant species were sparrows (White-crowned Sparrow
   {[}Zonotrichia leucophrys], American Tree Sparrow {[}Spizella arborea],
   and Savannah Sparrow {[}Passerculus sandwichensis]) and warblers
   (Wilson's Warbler {[}Wilsonia pusilla] and Orange-crowned Warbler
   {[}Vermivora celata]). The avian community in Denali National Park was
   similar to other areas in the region, although there were some
   distinctive differences. The majority of detected individuals (69\%)
   presumably migrate to the tropics; residents accounted for only 9\% of
   the individuals detected. Shrublands had the greatest relative abundance
   of any habitats surveyed, whereas species richness was greatest in tall
   shrub and spruce forest habitats. These findings generally concur with
   previous research in the region. Both habitats should be important
   components in any program that attempts to monitor avian populations in
   interior Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) predation on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
   fawns was studied using radiotelemetry techniques on an island in
   central Norway. Red foxes killed 48\% of the monitored roe deer fawns
   within 60 days of birth, and mortality from other factors constituted
   only a minor part (5\%) of the total mortality. The predation rate was
   lower in first week of life than during the subsequent 3 weeks. Male roe
   deer fawns were four times more susceptible to red fox predation than
   female fawns. We argue that these results reflect differences in
   behaviour between the sexes. There were some indications that time of
   birth may be important in determining vulnerability of fawns to red fox
   predation, with fawns born during the birth peak suffering more
   predation than fawns born outside the peak. The type of habitat a roe
   deer fawn used appeared to influence the probability of being killed by
   a red fox, and our results supported the hypothesis that hiding is a
   strategy to avoid predation in dense habitats. Fawns killed by red foxes
   used open grassland significantly more than surviving fawns, which used
   woodland to a greater extent.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic variation in susceptibility to the pathogen Bacillus
   thuringiensis Berliner ssp. kurstaki was assessed among five populations
   of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens), across
   Canada. Larvae or pupae were collected from Prince Edward Island,
   northern New Brunswick, central Ontario, northeastern Alberta, and
   northeastern British Columbia. The response of field populations to the
   1980 industrial standard of the HD-1 strain of the pathogen was compared
   with the concurrent response of a laboratory colony as an internal
   standard. Equal slopes of the probit regression lines indicated
   homogeneity of variation in susceptibility among populations. LC,,
   values ranged from 2.6 international units (IU) per sixth-instar larva
   for the most susceptible population to 8.3 IU per larva for the least
   susceptible. Although significant, the variation in population
   susceptibility was within the range of variation that is commonly
   observed among repeated bioassays against cohorts of a single
   population. We conclude that variation in susceptibility to B.
   thuringiensis among spruce budworm populations is low. The data provide
   a basis for monitoring changes in susceptibility of spruce budworm
   populations in response to increased use of this pathogen in
   forest-protection programs.}},

Abstract = {{Adult specimens of the slug, Deroceras reticulatum, were exposed to
   sublethal concentrations of lead, cadmium, and zinc. After three weeks
   of exposure, atomic absorption spectrophotometry revealed accumulation
   of all these metals in the animals. Highest exposure concentrations of
   lead, cadmium, and zinc resulted in highest contents of the respective
   metals in the slugs. In accordance with this effect, D. reticulatum
   showed an increased expression of the 70 kD stress protein (stress-70,
   hsp70) in response to exposure to all three heavy metals tested.
   Quantification of hsp70 increase took place with standardized
   Western-blotting and densitometric imaging after background correction.
   Multiple investigations revealed different reaction patterns to lead,
   cadmium, or zinc exposure and showed that the applied technique serves
   as a versatile tool to assess invertebrate stress reactions in response
   to environmentally relevant toxicants. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Two surveys were carried out to examine the temporal variation of
   hepatic cytochrome P450 1A(CYP1A) indices and indices of exposure to
   organic contaminants in flounder, Platichthys flesus, in the Dutch
   Wadden Sea. Hepatic CYP1A protein was measured immunochemically using a
   semiquantitative ELISA, and also by its catalytic activity using the
   7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation activity (EROD) assay. Concentrations
   of a selection of CB congeners in muscle and liver, and concentrations
   of 1-OH pyrene in bile, were used as indicators of exposure to PCBs and
   PAHs respectively. Both classes of compounds contain CYP1A-inducing
   congeners. Muscle and liver concentrations of CB congeners remained
   stable between June and March. However, a distinct peak in
   concentrations occurred just after the spawning period during March to
   April, but only in mature males. This peak could be associated with the
   presence of a population of migrating fish at the sampling location at
   that particular time. The concentration of 1-OH pyrene in bile showed a
   very different temporal pattern, with lowest concentrations just after
   the spawning period.
   CYP1A indices remained stable from June to October, but a distinct peak
   occurred immediately after the spawning period. In adult flounder,
   sex-related differences in EROD activity were observed during the
   spawning period, and sex-related differences in CYP1A protein level
   during the post-spawning period (March to June).
   The results of the present study indicate that spawning-related seasonal
   fluctuations in CYP1A indices and PCB concentrations in flounder are
   comparable to those observed in other fish species. Monitoring
   programmes incorporating the measurement of these parameters should take
   seasonal fluctuations into account. Such programmes should preferably
   focus on the period June to October in order to minimise the influence
   of physiological processes and migratory behaviour associated with the
   annual reproductive cycle, If this is done, sampling does not need to
   take into account the sex, sexual maturity, or morphological state of
   the fish, although limiting the range of lengths incorporated in the
   sample to, say, 18 to 32 cm, will avoid excessive variation in fish age.

Abstract = {{Declines in amphibian populations are rarely reported on the community
   or ecosystem level. We combined broad-scale field sampling with
   historical analyses of museum records to quantify amphibian declines in
   California's Great Central Valley. Overall, amphibians showed an
   unambiguous pattern of decline, although the intensity of decline varied
   both geographically and taxonomically. The greatest geographical decline
   was detected in the counties of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys.
   Two species, Rana aurora and Bufo boreas were identified as the most
   affected by decline, whereas Pseudacris regilla was the least affected.
   The Coast Range counties has little or no detectable decline. We provide
   new evidence implicating introduced predators as a primary threat.
   Introduced predators occur at lower elevations that native species, and
   our data indicate that for some native species there has been
   significant restriction to higher elevation sites from a formerly
   broader distribution. Our historical approach provides a strategy for
   identifying declining amphibian communities that complements more
   detailed, long-term monitoring programs and provides an assessment of
   the pattern of change that is a necessary prerequisite for the
   development of field experiments that test hypothesized mechanisms of
   change.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of plant species diversity on the density of the herbivore,
   Anomoea flavokansiensis Moldenke (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), on
   Desmanthus illinoensis (Michaux) MacMillan (Mimosaceae), a promising
   North American legume for exploring the principles of diverse, perennial
   grain agriculture was examined. From mid-June to early August A.
   flavokansiensis feeds on young leaves and inflorescences of D.
   llinoensis. At high density, A. flavokansiensis potentially reduces seed
   yield and is thus an important consideration for long-term stands that
   are to be grown without insecticides. The potential to manage this
   insect via intercropping its host species with other, non-host perennial
   species by monitoring A. flavokansiensis density on D. illinoensis
   within experimental monocultures, two-species mixtures with Tripsacum
   dactyloides, and three-species mixtures with T. dactyloides and Leymus
   racemosus was examined. Insects were censused 2-3 times weekly from
   mid-June to early August at two sites from 1991 to 1995. In the first
   three years, beetle density was generally low (<1 per plant), and did
   not differ among treatments. In the fourth year, however, beetle density
   peaked at 15 and 25 insects per plant at the two sites, and was highest
   within monoculture for most dates. In 1995, density was again low, but
   tended to remain higher in monoculture at one site. The results suggest
   that beetle density on D. illinoensis can be reduced in polyculture and
   may hold promise for the management of this insect herbivore within
   perennial grain polycultures.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology using soil arthropods as a nontarget assay of chloropicrin
   fumigation against Phellinus root rot is described. Significant
   differences in seasonal abundances in control plot populations occurred
   for each of the 6 most common trophic guilds. Population densities were
   highest for springtails (Collembola) and oribatid miles (Cryptostigmata)
   during the late summer dry season; densities were highest in early
   spring for worms (Oligochaeta), mesostigmatid mites, and fungivorous
   macroarthropods. Biomass was highest for worms and mesostigmatid mites
   in spring, but fungivorous macroarthropods peaked in late summer.
   Springtails and oribatids were equivalent throughout the year measured
   as biomass; population peaks in dry summer are composed primarily of
   immatures. Nearly all individual species of springtails and oribatid
   mites had population densities that differed significantly by season;
   individual springtail abundances fluctuated with greater amplitudes than
   those of oribatids. Both springtails and oribatid mites increased
   significantly in population density and biomass from the Ist to the 2nd
   yr postharvest. Experiments using soil arthropods as bioindicators in
   forest soils beneath clearcuttings should be monitored throughout the
   year to avoid confusing treatment effects with normal life history
   cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Diapause termination, postdiapause duration, and field hatch of the
   bigheaded grasshopper, Aulocara elliotti (Thomas), were studied in
   southwest Montana during a 3-yr period. In general, >70\% of the sampled
   population had completed diapause by mid-November each year.
   Postdiapause embryonic developmental rates were obtained from a function
   fitted to hatch versus time data collected at constant temperatures
   ranging from 15 to 42 degrees C. The population model design system was
   used to predict hatch at 2 sites in southwestern Montana for 3 yr.
   First-instar occurrence was monitored by sweep net samples and used to
   assess the accuracy of the predictions. When simulated hatch was
   compared with held occurrence of Ist instars, the 50\% occurrence dates
   were very similar (within 2.2 +/- 1.1 d for all 5 comparisons). The
   results of our investigations should enhance the ability of decision
   support systems for grasshopper management to provide forecasts to land
   managers and pest advisors.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and sensitive assay for DNA-protein cross-links has been used

   Pilot studies of DNA-protein cross-links in peripheral blood lymphocytes
   have been conducted with individuals who had higher exposure to
   chromate, including welders, and with individuals who had lower levels
   of exposure such as residents living in a chromium-contaminated area in
   Jersey City, New Jersey. Studies were also conducted in two Bulgarian
   cities (Jambol and Burgas) with different levels of air pollution and
   Cr(VI) exposure and in chrome platers in Bulgaria who had high exposure
   to chromate. DNA-protein crosslinks in U.S. welders and in individuals
   living in Hudson County. New Jersey around chromium-contaminated areas
   were significantly higher compared to matched controls. Although blood
   and urinary levels of chromium were not extensively studied in these
   populations, we were able to obtain these measurements in the Bulgarian
   population. Chromium levels in red blood cells of controls living in
   Burgas were in the order of 1 to 2 ppb chromium, and these individuals
   had the lowest levels of DNA-protein cross-links. However, the chromium
   levels in Jambol ranged from about 2 to 7 ppb in red blood cells of city
   residents to about 22 ppb in chrome platers. DNA-protein cross-links
   were saturated at about 7 to 8 ppb chromium in the red blood cells, and
   cross-links correlated well only with chromium levels in red blood
   cells. Urinary chromium levels did not correlate well with either
   DNA-protein cross-links or chromium levels in with red blood cells.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the status of Pacific salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) in southeastern Alaska. Of 9,296 spawning aggregates identified
   in this region, some data were available for 4,009 (43\%), and 928
   (10\%) had sufficient information to analyze for escapement trend, Of
   those analyzed, 333 (36\%) were increasing, 556 (60\%) were stable, 37
   (4\%) were declining, and 2 (< 1\%) showed precipitous declines. We
   evaluated risk of extinction of spawning aggregates using criteria
   similar to surveys outside Alaska, We rated 918 (99\%) at no or low
   risk, 8 (similar to 1\%) at moderate risk, and 2 (< 1\%) at high risk.
   No spawning aggregates were identified as extinct based on our
   evaluation of escapement data dating back to 1960, Prior to 1960, two
   spawning aggregates, one sockeye salmon (O. nerka) and one chum salmon
   (O. keta), were identified as extinct based on responses to a postal
   questionnaire. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game grouped spawning
   aggregates into management units for each species. Management units vary
   in number and size for each species. Of 141 management units defined,
   129 (92\%) had enough information to evaluate; all had stable or
   increasing escapement trends. However, escapement data for this study
   had limitations for two reasons. First, monitoring spawning aggregates
   for escapement in all spawning locations in southeastern Alaska is
   impractical; interpretations are based instead on estimates of key
   indicator streams (usually commercially important runs) in the region.
   Second, most escapement estimates are based on aerial surveys rather
   than more accurate methods such as weirs or sonar estimates. Our
   results, based on the limited data, indicated that Pacific salmon in the
   region were generally in good health at two levels of salmon population
   structure: spawning aggregates and management units. The small amount of
   escapement data for steelhead precludes a generalization about their
   status and overall health.}},

Title = {{The determination of total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations
   in freshwaters from land use, stock headage and population data: Testing
   of a model for use in conservation and water quality management}},

Abstract = {{1. Nutrient concentrations (particularly N and P) determine the extent
   to which water bodies are or may become entrophic. Direct determination
   of nutrient content on a wide scale is labour intensive but the main
   sources of N and P are well known. This paper describes and tests an
   export coefficient model for prediction of total N and total P from: (i)
   land use, stock headage and human population; (ii) the export rates of N
   and P from these sources; and (iii) the river discharge. Such a model
   might be used to forecast the effects of changes in land use in the
   future and to hindcast past water quality to establish comparative or
   baseline states for the monitoring of change.
   2. The model has been calibrated against observed data for 1988 and
   validated against sets of observed data for a sequence of earlier years
   in ten British catchments varying from uplands through rolling, fertile
   lowlands to the flat topography of East Anglia.
   3. The model predicted total N and total P concentrations with high
   precision (> 95\% of the variance in observed data explained). It has
   been used in two forms: the first on a specific catchment basis; the
   second for a larger natural region which contains the catchment with the
   assumption that all catchments within that region will be similar. Both
   models gave similar results with little loss of precision in the latter
   case. This implies that it will be possible to describe the overall
   pattern of nutrient export in the UK with only a fraction of the effort
   needed to carry out the calculations for each individual water body.
   4. Comparison between land use, stock headage, population numbers and
   nutrient export for the ten catchments in the pre-war year of 1931, and
   for 1970 and 1988 show that there has been a substantial loss of rough
   grazing to fertilized temporary and permanent grasslands, an increase in
   the hectarage devoted to arable, consistent increases in the stocking of
   cattle and sheep and a marked movement of humans to these rural
   catchments.
   5. All of these trends have increased the flows of nutrients with more
   than a doubling of both total N and total P loads during the period. On
   average in these rural catchments, stock wastes have been the greatest
   contributors to both N and P exports, with cultivation The next most
   important source of N and people of P. Ratios of N to P were high in
   1931 and remain little changed so that, in these catchments, phosphorus
   continues to be the nutrient most likely to control algal crops in
   standing waters supplied by the rivers studied.}},

Abstract = {{1. Organisms capable of asexual reproduction often maintain substantial
   clonal diversity within their populations. We ask whether such diversity
   in Daphnia pulicaria populations is maintained by temporal and spatial
   variation in selection.
   2. We monitored temporal and spatial variation in the relative abundance
   of electrophoretically determined clonal groups in three lake
   populations of D. pulicaria from April to October 1991.
   3. Clonal composition differed among lakes, but within each population
   we observed strong temporal changes in the relative abundance of
   different clonal groups. The timing and rate of this clonal succession
   was associated with the rate of loss of deep water habitat from seasonal
   anoxia.
   4. Within each lake, clonal groups also segregated vertically into
   shallow and deep water assemblages. The magnitude of this habitat
   segregation varied temporally and was associated with the abundance of a
   shallow water competitor species, D. galeata.
   5. We suggest that strong associations of clonal succession and clonal
   habitat segregation with environmental changes (habitat availability and
   competitor abundance) indicate selection operating on the clonal
   composition of these populations.}},

Abstract = {{In 1991, the State of Tennessee initiated a Health Studies Agreement
   with the U.S. Department of Energy. It included independent studies of
   possible adverse health effects in people living near the Oak Ridge
   Reservation resulting from releases of chemicals and radionuclides since
   1942. A Dose Reconstruction Feasibility, the first of a planned sequence
   of initiatives to evaluate the potential for health effects, included
   application of screening methods to focus subsequent dose reconstruction
   and epidemiologic efforts on the materials and emission sources that
   have historically been most important. The feasibility study produced a
   history of operations that likely generated off-site releases from the
   X-10, K-25, Y-12, and S-50 plants, based on reviews of classified and
   unclassified records and interviews of active and retired workers. The
   availability of environmental monitoring and research data that would
   support dose reconstruction was also characterized. Quantitative
   emission and environmental contamination data were used to identify
   those materials and plant activities that should receive the highest
   priority in further health studies. Plausible exposure pathways were
   identified, and screening methods were used to identify the most
   important pathways and past activities that appear to be associated with
   the greatest health hazards. The materials and activities shown to have
   the highest potential for public health hazards are as follows: 1) The
   release of radioiodine {[}likely over 3.7 PBq (100,000 Ci)] to the air
   from radioactive lanthanum (''RaLa'') processing at X-10 (now Oak Ridge
   National Laboratory) from 1944 through 1956; 2) The release of Cs-137
   and other radionuclides in liquid wastes from chemical separation
   activities at X-10; 3) The release of mercury to the air, soil, and
   surface waters from Y-12 lithium enrichment operations between 1950 and
   1963. About 11,000,000 kg of mercury were handled at Y-12, and 910,000
   kg were reported lost or unaccounted for; and 4) The release of
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from machining oils, electrical
   equipment, and other sources in the Oak Ridge area. Based on the

Abstract = {{The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment sponsored a
   study to reconstruct contaminant doses to the public from operations at
   the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility. This analysis of routine
   releases of plutonium and uranium, the principal radioactive materials
   used at the plant, was part of the Colorado Department of Public Health
   and Environment study. Historical radionuclide monitoring and data
   handling practices are characterized and uncertainties are quantified.
   Estimates of the annual release of plutonium and uranium are provided
   for the period from 1953 to 1989. Off-site airborne concentrations and
   deposition of plutonium and uranium associated with the releases are
   estimated, along with the highest doses for off-site populations. The
   predicted effective doses from the routine release of plutonium and
   uranium from Rocky Flats for a person residing near the plant boundary
   between 1953 and 1989 are very small.}},

Abstract = {{Changes through time in a small, isolated population of natterjack toads
   on the Solway Firth are reported. The area and linear length of
   coastline occupied by the colony have declined since it was first
   described in 1849. The colony now occupies less than 20\% of its former
   range. The rate of decline has increased since the 1960s and has
   continued into the present decade. This decline has been accompanied by
   losses of breeding pools and habitat which can be directly attributed to
   anthropogenic changes in land-use. Comparison of aerial photographs
   between 1946 and 1988 show, amongst other changes, a major loss (>60\%)
   of coastal sandy grassland, favoured by natterjacks, to agricultural
   intensification and to the recreational development which now surrounds
   the colony. Recent population monitoring (1986-1995) shows a failure of
   recruitment in five of the six years before 1991. During this period the
   annual peak counts fluctuated between nine and thirty adult males, well
   below a previous estimate in 1976 of 100 males. Artificial excavation of
   breeding pools in 1991 resulted in the subsequent production annually of
   large numbers of toadlets. A peak count of 79 males in 1995 probably
   reflects the recruitment to the breeding population of these cohorts and
   gives the first indication of recovery in this population. Re-occupation
   of the former range is no longer possible. The expansion of the colony
   to areas of suitable habitat away from the native site, but with no
   previous records of natterjacks, is discussed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{1085-1093}},

Abstract = {{1. The lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) has experienced a dramatic
   decline in the last 20 years in the Western Palearctic. To help in
   making decisions for the recovery of the species, a matrix projection
   model has been developed using demographic data from an intensively
   monitored population in southern Spain in 1988-93. Survival rates were
   estimated using the Jolly-Seber modelling approach and Program SURGE.
   2. The growth rate of the population was lambda = 0.959 +/- 0.04. The
   upper 95\% confidence limit of lambda is 1.0398, and thus our estimate
   of lambda is not significantly different from that of a stable
   population (i.e. lambda = 1). Using the mean value for lambda, the
   probability of extinction for this population, now consisting of
   approximate to 1000 breeding pairs, is 35\% in 100 years and 98\% in 200
   years.
   3. A sensitivity analysis indicates that population growth was most
   sensitive for changes in adult survival, followed by juvenile survival,
   productivity of fledglings, proportion of adults that attempt breeding
   and age at first breeding.
   4. Adult and juvenile survival do not seem easily amenable to
   management, but the small improvement (8.5\%) that could be reached
   enforcing protective laws substantially reduce the probability of
   extinction of the population.
   5. Productivity is less than half its potential maximum due to massive
   nestling mortality. Increasing food availability around the breeding
   colonies through habitat management (e.g. leaving uncultivated strips
   around fields and favouring cereal crops), or introducing the species in
   areas containing suitable habitat may substantially increase
   productivity. Combining these measures with the achievable improvement
   (8.5\% increase) in adult and juvenile survival maximizes the long-term
   survival of lesser kestrel populations.}},

Abstract = {{Colored stich traps were tested in citrus groves in Lee, Hendry: and
   Polk counties, Florida, for attraction of Frankliniella bispinosa
   (Morgan) adults. White was superior to yellow, red, or orange in
   attracting F. bispinosa and had a higher spectral reflectance at
   wavelengths below 500 nm. Kromecote white was superior to Olson white or
   Chromolux metallic mother-of-pearl and comparable to Chromolux and
   Duo-Tang blues. Kromecote white, Chromolux blue, and Duo-Tang blue had
   30-50\% reflectance values in the range of 400-450 nm wavelengths, and
   their spectral reflectance curves were similar to those of `Valencia'
   and navel orange petals. White trap catches of F. bispinosa increased
   from 24 to 72 h, whereas yellow traps did not. Corresponding trap
   catches of adult F. bispinosa using a Mark V Krome Kote trap were not
   significantly different at 24-h intervals over 4-d periods. Weathering
   did not adversely affect trap catch between 24- and 96-h exposures. Use
   of disposable traps reduces degradation of color from sunlight. Mark V
   white, Chromolux blue, and Duo-Tang blue disposable cards have potential
   for use in assessing population activity off bispinosa in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), population
   trends were monitored in potatoes under different pest management and
   cultural regimes. Four cultural practices (straw mulch, spent mushroom
   compost, both mulch and compost, and conventional practices without
   mulch or compost) were used as subplots within main plots representing 3
   pest management practices. In 1992, beetles were managed by hand removal
   until July, and the 3 treatments were removal without soil fumigation,
   no removal without fumigation, and no removal with fumigation. In 1993
   and 1994, beetles were managed by use of insecticides, and the 3
   treatments were insecticides with soil fumigation, insecticides without
   fumigation, and no insecticides with fumigation. Straw mulch reduced the
   density per square meter of adults and large larvae in plots without
   beetle management in 1992 and 1994, and the density of adults in
   insecticide-treated plots in 1993. Defoliation was lower in mulched
   subplots without beetle management in 1992 and 1994, and leaf area
   (1992) or ground cover (1994) was increased in these treatments, but
   yield was not affected. Compost increased leaf area and yield in 1992,
   and increased the density of adults and egg masses in that year, but
   generally had minor effects on beetle density and varying effects on
   yield. Fumigation significantly decreased yield in 1992 and 1994, and it
   had no effect on yield in 1993. Any benefits of fumigation in mitigating
   disease were offset by the earlier peak in density of large larvae in
   1992, and the greater density of adults in 1993 and 1994 in fumigated
   plots compared with plots without fumigation.}},

Abstract = {{Ten populations of Hessian By Mayetiola destructor (Sav), from the
   eastern United States were evaluated for biotype composition and
   response to Hessian By resistance genes H9-H19 in wheat. The biotype
   composition of Hessian By populations was estimated by confining
   individual gravid females on wheat `Monon' (H3),'Magnum' (H5),
   `Caldwell' (H6), and `Seneca' (H7H8). The response of Hessian fly
   populations and laboratory biotypes to resistance genes from the
   Purdue/USDA program were evaluated in replicated tests with wheat lines
   homozygous for these genes. Hessian fly populations from northwestern
   Florida and southwestern South Carolina were predominantly biotypes E,
   G, M, and O and were avirulent to H7H8. Fly populations from
   northeastern and northwestern South Carolina had a low percentage of
   biotype E, but contained H7H8-virulent biotypes J and L in varying
   frequency. Populations from north central Arkansas and Indiana were
   predominatly biotype L. In tests with genes H9-H19 with
   laboratory-reared biotypes GP, B, C, D, E, and L, H9 was susceptible to
   biotype C, H12 to biotype E, and H11 and H15 to biotype L. Genes H16 and
   H17 were resistant to all Hessian fly biotypes and populations, and the
   remaining genes varied in response to By sources. The resistance of
   genes H9-H19 to the 10 Hessian fly populations, in descending order of
   effectiveness, was H16 = H17 > H9 = H13 = H14 > H10 = H18 > H12 = H15 =
   H19 > H11. The number of Hessian By populations virulent to the
   respective genes were H16, H17 = 0; H9, H13, H14 = 1; H10, H18 = 2; H12,
   H15, H19 = 3; H11 = 7. Research demonstrated the importance of
   continuing to sample held populations. Changes in frequency of virulent
   genotypes and the response of genotypes to specific resistance genes
   should be monitored in order to develop deployment strategies to improve
   the durability of resistance in wheat cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the health risks for a rural northeastern Oregon
   population which is exposed to high nitrate levels in well water. The
   study also identified possible sources of nitrate contamination, and
   investigated measures the residents had taken to reduce their nitrate
   exposure from well water. Three data sets were used in the study,
   including a telephone survey of the residents, existing information
   collected by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality about well
   water nitrate concentrations, and demographic information from census
   records.
   Results revealed that 23\% of the surveyed population was drinking well
   water that contained nitrate in excess of the 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen
   maximum contaminant level adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency for drinking water. Seventy-two percent of the households with
   nitrate levels exceeding the 10 ppm level did not use devices that
   effectively remove nitrates. The population included few women of
   childbearing age, and was generally older than other nearby urban or
   rural populations. Resident infants were not exposed to well water
   nitrate in excess of the 10 ppm level, and were therefore not at
   apparent risk for methemoglobinemia (''blue-baby syndrome''). Although
   the risk of infant methemoglobinemia was low in this area, it is
   recommended that alternative water sources be explored, and the
   follow-up monitoring be performed by state and/or local agencies.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the investigation was to find a suitable approach for
   assessing inhalation exposure of urban inhabitants to polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air: Personal exposure to PAHs of
   fifteen subjects, Zagreb inhabitants, was measured over a week in summer
   and again in winter All subjects kept a diary of motion and activities
   and filled in a questionnaire on the characteristics of their fiat and
   household members. PAHs concentrations inside and outside subject's
   homes were simultaneously measured as were those in the working
   environment and in transport. Using an exposure model which takes into
   account the rime spent by the subjects in each microenvironment and the
   respective concentrations measured, the inhalation exposure of each
   subject was calculated and compared with the directly measured personal
   exposure for the winter season only the summer concentrations being
   negligible. For a few subjects the calculated inhalation exposure
   deviated considerably from the one measured directly This could be
   attributed to the fact that the subject spent some time in a
   microenvironment with significantly different PAH levels which were not
   included in the calculation. However; if the average results for the
   whole group are considered there was no statistically significant
   difference between the directly measured and calculated PAH inhalation
   exposures. Therefore the described approach could be used for
   calculating average inhalation exposure to PAHs of population groups
   with common characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The field metabolic rates (FMR) and water fluxes of Varanus scalaris
   were measured during the wet and dry seasons by the doubly-labelled
   water technique. Seasonal measurements of standard (night-time)
   metabolism (SMR) and resting (daytime) metabolism (RMR) were made in the
   laboratory at 18, 24, 30 and 36 degrees C, and maximal oxygen
   consumption was measured at 36 degrees C on a motorized treadmill. This
   population was active throughout the year. In the wet season, the mean
   FMR was 7.8 kJ day(-1) (128.0 kJ kg(-1) day(-1); mean mass = 66.4 g, n =
   13), and during the dry season the mean was 5.0 kJ day(-1) (67.6 kJ
   kg(-1) day(-1); mean mass = 77.4 g, n = 17). The mean water flux rates
   for these animals were 3.6 and 1.2 ml day(-1), respectively (60.4 and
   16.6 ml kg(-1) day(-1)). The seasonal means of FMR and water flux were
   significantly different by ANCOVA (P < 0.0001). Measurements of SMR and
   RMR were significantly higher in the wet season (ANCOVA: P < 0.0001),
   but we found no difference in the maximal oxygen consumption between
   seasons (ANCOVA: P = 0.6). The maximal oxygen consumption of the lizards
   on the treadmill (2.9 ml min(-1) = 1.8 ml g(-1) h(-1)), mean mass = 97.4
   g, n = 16) was 20 times that of the SMR at the same temperature during
   the dry season, and 11 times that of the SMR during the wet season. The
   seasonal differences in FMR were attributable to: changes in SMR
   (12.2\%) and RMR (16.4\%); differences in night-time body temperatures
   (11.3) and daytime body temperatures (16.4\%); and activity (broadly
   defined to include locomotion, digestion, and reproductive costs
   (43.7\%).}},

Abstract = {{The black. abalone Haliotis cracherodii was once abundant in many
   intertidal habitats in southern California, USA. Beginning in 1985,
   however, black abalone in southern California suffered mass mortalities
   attributed to a condition termed withering syndrome. The mass
   mortalities and withering syndrome were confined to southern California
   except for Diablo Cove, 70 km north of Point Conception, where
   mortalities were limited to the immediate vicinity of a warm-water
   discharge. Beginning in 1992, we monitored 5 locations along the
   mainland coast of central California to determine whether mass
   mortalities of black. abalone would occur there. Abalone numbers
   decreased at the 3 southern sites but not at the 2 northern sites. The
   decline was greatest at the southernmost site, Government Point (near
   Point Conception), where there was a 97\% reduction in numbers between
   1992 and 1995. The 2 sites immediately upcoast of Government Point,
   Boathouse and Point Arguello, experienced a 39 to 46\% decline, while
   the 2 northernmost sites (Stairs and Purisima) experienced a slight
   increase in abalone. All abalone size classes declined at Government
   Point, Boathouse and Point Arguello, indicating the decline was not
   caused by overharvesting. Symptoms of withering syndrome, assessed by
   pulling on individuals, were noted at Boathouse and Point Arguello.
   Withering syndrome was also detected in the final survey at Stairs, as
   was a slight decline in abalone abundance, suggesting that mass
   mortalities may be beginning there. Our observations demonstrate that
   widespread mass mortality associated with withering syndrome has reached
   central California and is progressing northward from Point Conception.}},

Abstract = {{Adult female mosquito populations were monitored at weekly intervals
   during spring-autumn (November-March) for 4 years (1991-95) using
   dry-ice-baited light traps at forty sites in the Murray Valley of
   Victoria, Australia. Among twenty species of mosquitoes collected, Culex
   annulirostris was the most abundant (66.6 +/- 9.3\%) followed by Cx
   australicus (15.3 +/- 7.7\%). From a total of 476,682 mosquitoes
   collected, nearly all were females and only 1295 (0.27\%) were males.
   Mosquito population densities were generally higher in 1992-93 and
   1993-94 seasons than in 1991-92 and 1994-95 seasons. Greatest densities
   of Cx annulirostris and Cx australicus occurred in 1992-93, coinciding
   with outbreaks of Ross River (RR) and Barmah Forest (BF) arboviruses
   causing human polyarthritis. In the majority of shires, Cx australicus
   was the predominant species from spring to early summer (November and
   December), then was replaced by Cx annulirostris from mid-summer to
   autumn (January-April). In three shires, Aedes bancroftianus and
   Ae.sagax predominated during the early part of the season. Densities of
   both Cx annulirostris and Cx australicus were related to temperature. Cx
   australicus adults were found to be trapped when the mean ambient
   temperature exceeded 6 degrees C, with peak population recorded at 20
   degrees C. Cx annulirostris adult density increased when the mean
   temperature rose above 12 degrees C, reaching a peak during February and
   March when temperature exceeded 25 degrees C. Cx annulirostris declined
   rapidly from April onwards, with no adult activity evident from May to
   November.
   Population densities of Aedes spp. were generally less than reported
   from earlier studies, possibly due to lower rainfall in spring and
   summer as well as reduced flood irrigation practices. In each year, a
   significant correlation was detected between Cx annulirostris density
   and RR virus incidence in humans. As Cx annulirostris is the predominant
   local mosquito species and feeds on a wide spectrum of hosts including
   man, it seems Likely that Cx annulirostris is the major vector of RR in
   the inland Murray Valley region.}},

Title = {{Molecular genetic identification of whale and dolphin products from
   commercial markets in Korea and Japan}},

Abstract = {{We report the methods and results of molecular genetic identification of
   the species and, in some cases, geographical origins of whale and
   dolphin products purchased from retail markets and restaurants in Japan
   and South Korea. As reported previously (Baker \& Palumbi 1994), we used
   the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a portable laboratory to
   amplify, purify and later sequence a portion of the mitochondrial DNA
   control region from 16 commercial products purchased in Japan. This
   `spot check' revealed a surprising variety of species for sale,
   including minke, fin and humpback whales and one or two species of
   dolphins sold as `kujira' or whale. In the Korean survey, DNA
   amplifications were conducted by two of us (C.S.B. and F.C.) working
   with independent equipment and reagents. The two sets of DNA
   amplifications were returned to our respective laboratories and
   sequenced independently for cross-validation. Among the total of 17
   species-specific sequences we found a dolphin, a beaked whale, 13
   Northern Hemisphere minke whales (representing at least seven distinct
   individuals) and two whales which are closely related to the recognized
   sei and Bryde's whales but could not be identified as either using
   available type sequences. We suggest that these two specimens represent
   a currently unrecognized species or subspecies of Bryde's whale,
   possibly the so-called `small-form' reported from the tropical waters of
   the Indo-Pacific.
   We conclude that molecular systematic analyses of DNA sequences have
   tremendous utility for the identification of whale and dolphin products.
   However, there are certain constraints on the application of these
   techniques for monitoring whaling or trade in whale products. First, PCR
   and DNA sequencing can generate misleading artefacts. These can
   generally be recognized or eliminated through experimental controls.
   Second, phylogenetic reconstructions of DNA sequences can be
   misinterpreted if the database of type sequences is inadequate or the
   taxonomy of the group is incomplete. This constraint is, at present, a
   more serious obstacle to molecular monitoring of whaling. Our results
   high-light uncertainties about the taxonomic status of oceanic
   populations and morphological forms of two species (or species
   complexes) targeted by legal and illegal hunting, the minke and Bryde's
   whales. Despite these uncertainties, it is difficult to reconcile some
   of the species available in Japanese and Korean commercial markets with
   recent catch records made available to the International Whaling
   Commission. It is particularly disturbing that two specimens of an
   unrecognized species or subspecies of baleen whale were for sale in a
   restaurant in South Korea in October, 1994, 8 years after the acceptance
   of an international moratorium on commercial whaling.}},

Abstract = {{Managers of protected natural areas across the country are increasingly
   concerned with the effects that adjacent land development have on parks,
   preserves, forests, and wildlife sanctuaries. Despite this concern,
   relatively few efforts have been undertaken to evaluate how protected
   natural areas are affected when adjacent natural land becomes urbanized.
   In the Rincon Valley, Arizona, immediately adjacent to Saguaro National
   Park acid Tucson, Arizona, two long-term monitoring efforts have been
   initiated to better understand how wildlife populations and riparian
   ecosystems are affected by urbanization. Although currently undeveloped,
   the Rincon Valley will experience intensive and rapid development during
   the next 10 years. A wildlife monitoring effort is examining how
   development will affect the Rincon Valley's reptile, amphibian, bird,
   and small mammal populations, and a riparian monitoring effort is
   documenting how development will affect some of the major biotic
   (streamside vegetation communities) and abiotic (ground water,
   streamflow, and channel morphology) components of riparian ecosystems,
   Since the monitoring efforts have been initiated prior to construction,
   it will be possible to document the effects of development on the
   natural resources in seldom-achieved detail.}},

Abstract = {{The study focuses on structural and compositional dynamics of
   high-elevation (boreal) mixed Picea-Betula forest in the Swedish
   Scandes. Data from seven years' monitoring of crown condition
   (defoliation), seed viability, soil and air temperatures, a tree-ring
   chronology and the age structure of Picea are presented. Real long-term
   dynamism of the tree cover was inferred from radiocarbon dates of buried
   subfossil wood. At all time-scales, the forest has responded sensitively
   to thermal variability. Picea seed viability, demography and radial
   growth correlated positively with summer temperature. The current Picea
   population largely results from warming during the first half of the
   20th century. However, cooler climate in the past c. five decades has
   led to reduced population and radial growth as well as accelerating
   crown defoliation. This decline is related primarily to winter soil
   temperatures. The mechanism of needle loss is deduced to be winter
   desiccation and resulting cavitation of the xylem. It is hypothesized
   that previous similar episodes have been balanced by periods of spruce
   expansion. The successional history leading up to the present stage
   includes fire disturbance and subsequent cooling during the Little Ice
   Age, which prolonged and consolidated the early post-fire Betula phase.
   Pinus was incapable of penetrating these unusually dense birch stands,
   whereas the shade-intolerant spruce could establish progressively as
   climate warmed. This course of structural and compositional dynamism
   relates to complex interactions of disturbance, climate change and
   reproductive responses.}},

Abstract = {{We show evidence of differential predation on snowshoe hares (Lepus
   americanus) by great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and ask whether
   predation mortality is related to antipredator behaviour in prey. We
   predicted higher predation on (1) young and inexperienced hares, (2)
   hares in open habitats lacking cover to protect from owl predation, and
   (3) hares in above average condition assuming that rich food patches are
   under highest risk of predation. Information on killed hares was
   obtained at nest sites of owls and by monitoring hares using
   radio-telemetry. The availability of age classes within the hare
   population was established from live-trapping and field data on
   reproduction and survival. Great horned owls preferred juvenile over
   adult hares. Juveniles were more vulnerable to owl predation before
   rather than after dispersal, suggesting that displacement or increased
   mobility were not causes for this increased mortality. Owls killed
   radio-collared hares more often in open than in closed forest types, and
   they avoided or had less hunting success in habitats with dense shrub
   cover. Also, owls took hares in above average condition, although it is
   unclear whether samples from early spring are representative for other
   seasons, In conclusion, these results are consistent with the hypothesis
   that variation in antipredator behaviours of snowshoe hares leads to
   differential predation by great horned owls.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the relationship between the removal rate and the
   spatiotemporal availability of ripe fruits of the tropical deciduous
   shrub Erythroxylum havanense in western Mexico. We also evaluated the
   effects of dispersal on seed survival during the first stages of
   establishment. Fast and early dispersal should be favored in E.
   havanense, since propagules have more time to grow and accumulate
   resources before the beginning of the severe dry season. In general,
   high rates of fruit removal imply faster and earlier dispersal. Thus,
   plants producing large crops should benefit from high removal rates,
   which will increase the probability of successful establishment by their
   progeny. To characterize both individual and population fruiting
   patterns, we made daily counts of fruits on 51 plants arranged in six
   clumps of different sizes. The daily number of fruits removed per plant
   was higher for plants with larger initial crop sizes and larger numbers
   of ripe fruits on a given day, but decreased as clump size increased.
   Additionally, we monitored postdispersal survival and germination in an
   experiment manipulating seed density, distance from adult plants, and
   seed predation. Early establishment was independent of density or
   distance, and vertebrate seed predation was the main agent of seed
   mortality. Our results indicate that the critical variable with respect
   to fruit removal is the number of fruits a plant produces, large plants
   having higher dispersal rates. Large plants are also more likely to have
   more seeds escaping postdispersal seed predation.}},

Abstract = {{Puccinia carduorum was first introduced into western Virginia in 1987
   for biological control of musk thistle (Carduus thoermeri). The
   pathogen's distribution was surveyed in 1992; it had spread to South
   Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, southeast Indiana,
   Maryland, and Delaware, some points more than 500 km from the release
   site. In 1994, it was found west of the Mississippi River in north
   central Missouri. Population development of the rust was monitored in
   several natural musk thistle stands in 1991 and 1992. Average pustule
   numbers per leaf were 0 to 0.7 in early May during early stem
   elongation, 0 to 17 (1991) and 8 to 52 (1992) at seed ripening in late
   June and early July as old plants died, 0.2 to 2.5 on young rosettes in
   September and October, and declining to near 0 by early December.
   Germinability of urediniospores from green tissue ranged from 10 to 88\%
   (mean 51\%) from May to October, with no significant seasonal trend.
   Teliospores were present on dead plants in late July and August but did
   not become prevalent on young rosettes until October and November.
   Latent periods (days from inoculation to first open pustule) on plants
   in the field were 13 to 14 days for inoculations in late April and early
   May, 8 days in June, 17 days in early October, and about 25 days in late
   October.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to examine the effects of low soil moisture
   on yellow nutsedge emergence in relation to thermal and chronological
   time and test the ability of thermal models generated previously to
   predict emergence under water stress, Unsprouted tubers from California
   and Arizona were planted in pots, buried at field sites in California
   and Arizona, and subjected to wet or dry treatments, Pots were monitored
   weekly to determine date of emergence and number of emerged shoots, The
   California genotype emerged 47 to 61 days after planting (DAP(3)) in the
   dry treatment and 33 to 49 DAP in the wet treatment, depending on
   planting site, The range for the Arizona genotype was 51 to 76 DAP in
   the dry treatment and 43 to 61 DAP in the wet treatment, Days and
   degree-day intervals to first emergence differed between irrigation
   treatments and planting sites but interactions were not significant, All
   models were accurate in predicting emergence dates for genotypes in the
   wet treatment at the California site, while emergence in Arizona was
   underestimated by 9 d, Tubers subjected to the dry treatment needed a
   higher number of accumulated degree-day units before emergence occurred
   and had fewer emerged shoots as compared to the wet treatment,
   Degree-day models generated for yellow nutsedge under optimal conditions
   lack sufficient robustness to be predictive under water stress
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In a preliminary study Bamezai and Kumar (1992) reported that a 24-h
   period of sleep deprivation may raise sister chromatid exchange (SCE)
   frequencies up to 193\% in peripheral blood lymphocytes. This was
   reinvestigated to clarify the role of sleep duration as a confounder for
   SCE, which is a well-established parameter for biomonitoring in
   occupational medicine. In our study, the SCE baseline and the influence
   of a 24-h period of sleep deprivation (test period) on SCE were
   investigated for 20 non-smoking volunteers (10 females and 10 males;
   20-29 years of age). There was no significant difference (p(all) =
   0.094) between the deviations of the two SCE rates of the control period
   (mean: - 0.21 +/- 0.90 SCE) and the differences between SCE rates before
   and after sleep deprivation (mean: 0.42 +/- 0.94 SCE) of each proband.
   No significant difference was detected between females and males, and
   SCE did not correlate with age or sleep duration. Therefore we conclude
   that the influence of sleep deficit on SCE is in the range of a normal
   day-to-day variance, and has not to be taken into account when SCE is
   used for a genotoxic monitoring at the workplaces.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies which have attempted to quantify the
   relationship between environmental lead and blood lead levels have been
   beset by numerous methodological problems, one of which has been the
   difficulty in assessing environmental exposure to lead. In Cape Town,
   South Africa, a comprehensive environmental lead monitoring programme
   was instituted in an inner city suburb where a blood lead screening
   study was in progress. The objective of the study was to examine the
   spatial and temporal variation in environmental lead levels, and to
   examine the role of potential influencing factors such as traffic.
   Results revealed substantial intra-urban variations in air lead levels,
   with annual means varying from less than 0.5 to over 2 mu g/m(3) at
   individual sites. Traffic density and the distance from heavily
   trafficked roads were important influencing factors within the area.
   Considerable seasonal as well as daily variations in air lead levels
   were also documented, and air lead levels were positively associated
   with dust lead levels. The spatial and temporal variations in
   environmental lead have implications for air monitoring strategies and
   epidemiological studies concerned with the relationship of exposure to
   lead and the health impact on populations. Micro variations in exposure
   need to be taken into account in assessing exposure to environmental
   lead in epidemiological studies, in light of the considerable variations
   which may occur.}},

Abstract = {{Home ranges and social organization of African elephants Loxodonta
   africana (Blumenbach) from the Laikipia-Sambura population of northern
   Kenya were studied. Twenty female elephants from this population were
   fitted with radio collars and monitored for up to 25 months. Home range
   sizes of radio-collared elephants varied from 102 to 5527 km(2), the
   widest variation that is known for a single population. Several
   subpopulations could be distinguished. The ranges of elephants from one
   subpopulation overlapped with those from other subpopulations, and
   elephants from different subpopulations were occasionally seen in the
   same groups, although they had different movement patterns and home
   range sizes, and tended to occur in groups of different sizes. Members
   of the same subpopulation were often close together if they were in the
   same area, whereas members of different subpopulations seldom came
   closer than 2 km. There was no evidence for the existence of `clans'
   within subpopulations, and it is suggested that this difference from
   other studied elephant populations is related to the much greater
   distances over which the Laikipia-Samburu elephants move.}},

Abstract = {{The timing and duration of the male rut were monitored in a population
   of springbok in the Kalahari from 1984. Timing was random and could not
   be related to any proximate factor; the duration varied from 5 to 23
   days, Springbok rams were shot: or captured in the hot-wet, cold-dry and
   hot-dry seasons from 1988 to 1992, Body condition and testicular
   exocrine and endocrine functions were measured, Territorial and
   non-territorial rams were treated in the same way. All body measurements
   were lower for non-territorial than for territorial rams, but only neck
   girth differed significantly. Captured animals were stimulated with GnRH
   and plasma testosterone concentrations were measured over 90 min,
   Overall, non-territorials showed a greater response than territorial
   rams, The response of territorial rams to GnRH at the beginning of a rut
   was significantly less than the response 1 week later, Ewes came into
   oestrus shortly after the beginning of the male rut; in four of the past
   five years lambing peaked in the hot-wet season. Rams appeared to be
   physiologically capable of reproductive activity throughout the year,
   and responded to various stimuli by exhibiting rutting and/or mating
   behaviour. The possible stimuli are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of flowering time, display size, and local
   floral density on fruit set in Tolumnia variegata, a pollination-limited
   orchid that offers no reward to its pollinator(s). During 1990, natural
   variation in flowering time, display size, and fruit set were monitored
   in 508 plants at one locality in Puerto Rico. The following season,
   orchid floral abundance per host tree (Randia aculeata) was manipulated
   to investigate its effect on fruit set. Four floral abundance treatments
   were established (700, 500, 300, and 100), each replicated four times.
   Flowering time was the most important trait affecting fruit set. The
   proportion of plants setting at least one fruit was significantly high
   early and late in the season, but low during the flowering peak. Thus,
   strong disruptive selection differential on flowering phenology was
   found. Display size had little effect on fruit set. A weak, but
   significant disruptive selection differential on display size was found.
   Orchid floral abundance per host tree had a significant effect on fruit
   set. Early in the season, T. variegata flowers with intermediate number
   of conspecific flowers exhibited a greater probability of setting fruit
   than those in host trees with fewer or more flowers. Our results show
   that flowering phenology may be evolutionarily unstable, possibly a
   consequence of the deception pollination system. Furthermore, a
   deception strategy would be relatively unsuccessful in populations where
   plants are found in either very dense or sparse patches.}},

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Some plants are more attractive to agricultural pests than the crop to
   which they are a pest. The use of these plants as indicator plants to
   monitor pest populations is examined. Bean plants were found to be
   effective indicators for forecasting the growth of carmine spider mite,
   Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval), on greenhouse tomatoes,
   Lycopersicum esculentum L. Spider mite population growth rates were the
   same on both host plants, but because they became established up to 5 wk
   earlier on beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L., monitoring carmine spider mite
   population growth on beans provides enough time to order and distribute
   natural enemies for their control on tomatoes. The oviposition and
   developmental rates of mites did not differ on the 2 host plants.
   However, the temperature threshold for oviposition was 7 degrees C lower
   on beans than tomatoes, resulting in earlier establishment and onset of
   population growth in the spring on the indicator plants. The potential
   for using indicator plants to establish biological control agents was
   investigated with the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis
   Athias-Henriot. P. persimilis became established equally well when
   broadcast on the crop (with its much lower prey population density) as
   when released only on infested indicator plants. Best control of carmine
   spider mites by Phytoseiulus was obtained when the predators were
   released when spider mite density reached 12 per tomato leaf, which
   occurred when the mite density on beans was 100 per leaf, 5 wk after
   reaching 12 mites per bean leaf. Acting on this threshold, a grower
   would have ample time to order, receive, and release predatory mites.
   Predation of spider mites by Phytoseiulus was higher on the tomatoes
   than the beans. Phytoseiulus populations dipped after introduction on
   both host plants but recovered more rapidly on beans. The different
   predation and survival rates on the 2 host plants probably served to
   keep the 2 population cycles on the 2 hosts out of synchrony, thereby
   sustaining the population interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The Capricorn Group of islands in Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine
   Park sustains one of the world's largest breeding populations of the
   Wedge-tailed Shearwater Puffinus pacificus. Heron Island, a 13.5 ha
   coral cay which supports tourist and research station leases as well as
   a national park, is the third largest nesting island in the group.
   Sample censuses of breeding burrows were conducted each year between
   1985 and 1990 and a further survey was completed in 1993. These returned
   estimates of between 13 264+/-1387 and 16 337+/-1545 active burrows ((Y)
   over cap+/-SE). Burrow densities within each of the habitats monitored
   showed no significant trends between years, although there were large
   differences in burrow density between habitats. There were roughly the
   same number of burrows in the developed (west) and national park (east)
   halves of the cay. A miniature video camera system (burrowscope), which
   allowed nesting chambers at the ends of burrows to be inspected, was
   used in 1989, 1990 and 1993. This demonstrated that around half the
   burrows were occupied by incubating birds. Variations were found in the
   distribution of incubating birds between habitats, although this did not
   remain constant between the years. In the 1993 season, breeding activity
   was traced from the burrow establishment to fledging stage. Fifty-one
   per cent of burrows were used for breeding (eggs laid), 77\% of eggs
   hatched and 80\% of chicks produced a fledgling. Overall breeding
   success for the island was estimated at 61\%. In 1993 the area
   designated as Buildings was found to have significantly lower hatching
   success compared with natural habitats. Most mortality occurred at the
   egg stage; however, in the Fringe habitat, mortality was highest at the
   chick stage. Previous surveys have estimated the breeding population
   from burrow counts. It now appears that only about 30\% of such burrows
   produce fledglings.}},

Abstract = {{Male common shrews (Sorer araneus) adopt two discrete mating tactics.
   The most successful males, in terms of number of offspring fathered, are
   those that establish large overlapping home ranges in areas of high
   female density early in the breeding season. An alternative, less
   successful mating tactic is to travel long distances in search of mating
   opportunities. This study is an investigation of correlates of
   reproductive success for males adopting these different mating tactics.
   Reproductive success under natural conditions was assessed using DNA
   fingerprinting, and survival of offspring was monitored in the field.
   The number of offspring fathered by males with overlapping home ranges
   was positively correlated with the number of female ranges overlapped
   during the breeding season and with testes mass. The number of offspring
   fathered by males that made long-distance movements was positively
   correlated with their epididymal sperm counts. It is argued that
   competitively superior (overlapping) males achieve high reproductive
   success by competing to maximize the number of females inseminated,
   whereas those adopting an alternative mating tactic instead compete
   largely via sperm competition, aiming to maximize insemination success
   with any particular female. There was no significant difference in the
   fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of males adopting different mating tactics
   (FA was measured as the difference in length of the paired lateral scent
   glands). Fluctuating asymmetry was not related to the number of
   offspring fathered by males adopting either mating tactic, but was
   significantly correlated with the proportion of male offspring fathered
   that survived to sexual maturity. Although apparently not correlated
   with mating success in this species, EA may reflect some aspect of
   genetic quality that affects offspring survival.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic studies of subtidal algae, particularly annuals, are rare.
   For a period of 16 months, we documented recruitment, growth,
   reproduction and mortality of the sporophytes of the canopy-forming kelp
   Nereocystis luetkeana and the understory kelp Costaria costata, and
   monitored the densities of three other brown seaweeds, in a subtidal
   community in the southern Puget Sound. The study site, located on the
   west side of the Tacoma Narrows, Washington (47 degrees 15'N, 122
   degrees 33'W), is a shallow, estuarian environment with a mixed sand and
   cobble substrate that is exposed to swift tidally generated currents.
   Juvenile Nereocystis and Costaria were first observed in early March
   1993 and 1994 and continued to appear until mid-June in 1993. Patterns
   of growth, reproduction and survivorship in Nereocystis and Costaria are
   distinctly different. Nereocystis stipe growth rates peaked (similar to
   5 cm/day) at the end of June and then declined, while relative blade
   growth rates increased (to 6 cm/day) after the period of maximum stipe
   elongation. Relative blade growth in Costaria declined from similar to 2
   cm/day in late May until growth ceased in mid-August. Reproductive
   Nereocystis plants were first observed in early May; 85\% of the
   population was fertile by early July. Reproductive Costaria plants were
   first observed on 22 June; 83\% were fertile by early August. Both
   Nereocystis and Costaria were strict annuals at this site.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the seasonality, distribution, and abundance of mullet
   larvae primarily from Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program
   (SEAMAP) ichthyoplankton surveys of the northern Gulf of Mexico between
   1982 and 1986. Although potentially nine species of mullet can occur in
   the southern portion of the study area, we found only Mugil cephalus, M.
   curema, and Agonostomus monticola. Mugil cephalus >6 mm SL are separated
   from M. curema and A. monticola by total number of anal fin elements.
   Larval A. monticola are separated from M. curema >7 mm SL by having a
   longer caudal peduncle and pigment on the second dorsal fin at about
   13.5 mm SL. Mugil curema and M. cephalus lack pigment on the second
   dorsal fin until >25 mm SL. Overall, most M. cephalus larvae are
   collected at stations with surface water temperatures less than or equal
   to 24.7 degrees C (mean: 23.0 degrees C) and salinities greater than or
   equal to 34.0 parts per thousand; most M. curema larvae are collected at
   stations greater than or equal to 24.5 degrees C (mean: 26.3 degrees C)
   and greater than or equal to 29.9 parts per thousand. During August
   1984, we also found 196 A. monticola (3.6-25.5 mm SL, N = 8 stations) at
   surface water temperatures of 28.6-29.5 degrees C and salinities of
   28.5-35.9 parts per thousand; we took all larval A. monticola along or
   west of 93 degrees 00'. Adults of all three species of mullet migrate
   offshore to spawn over or beyond the outer continental shelf. Larval M.
   cephalus are collected from October to March, but are most abundant
   during November and December. Mugil curema are collected primarily from
   April through September but are most abundant during April-May and to a
   lesser extent August-September; limited spawning occurs during July.
   Mugil spp. larvae >4.0 mm of both species are collected primarily near
   the surface. We suggest that based on prevailing current patterns, tag
   return, and electrophoretic data, M. cephalus spawned in the vicinity of
   the Mississippi River delta during late fall and early winter help
   maintain mullet populations in the eastern and western Gulf of Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment may play a critical role in the structure and dynamics of
   coral reef populations and communities. In this study recruitment of
   shallow-water gorgonians was monitored semiannually at two sites on the
   southwest coast of Puerto Rico for 8 y (1984-1992). Recruitment usually
   varied between 5 and 10 colonies . m(-2) for most of the study period
   but reached episodic proportions (up to 45 colonies . m(-2)) from
   autumn, 1984 throughout 1985. This period of high recruitment has had a
   major impact on age-frequency distributions and is largely responsible
   for a 6-fold increase in colony densities (from 9.8 to 62.3 colonies .
   m(-2)) during the study period at one of the sites. Gorgonian
   populations can be termed `'recruitment-limited'' from this perspective.
   An examination of `'stock-recruitment'' relationships indicated that the
   species composition of recruit colonies largely follows the relative
   abundances of adult (large) colonies. The episode of high recruitment
   may have resulted from the mass mortality of a major benthic grazer.
   Diadema antillarum in 1984. The possibility that high colony densities
   limited recruitment during the latter stages of this study in the
   continued absence of Diadema was falsified by field experiments in which
   higher recruitment occurred in control quadrats compared to quadrats
   cleared of gorgonians.}},

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1590-1596}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that reduced behavioral activity of birds exposed
   to anticholinesterase pesticides could bias measures of exposure in
   field studies if the worst-affected individuals were underrepresented in
   samples collected by shooting or netting. To assess the likely scale of
   such biases, European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were housed in large
   aviaries containing simulated bushes made from natural vegetation. Each
   bird was given a near-lethal dose of the organophosphorus pesticide
   chlorfenvinphos, and the proportion of time spent in and out of cover
   was recorded before and after treatment. Use of cover by exposed birds
   increased significantly 0 to 7 h after treatment, whereas feeding and
   Eying activity decreased. On the following day, there was little
   difference in the use of cover by exposed and control birds.
   Mathematical models were used to estimate the effect of these behavioral
   changes on the sampling of birds from wild populations. The results
   confirm the potential for sampling bias to occur after acute pesticide
   exposure. This bias is reduced in samples taken over 24 h after
   exposure, but delayed samples are unlikely to be representative of
   cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition at the time of maximal effect. When
   poisoned birds seek cover, it is more difficult to find casualties in
   field trials and the probability that dead birds will be found and
   recorded in wildlife casualty monitoring schemes is reduced. We conclude
   that considerable caution is required in using ChE activity as an
   indicator of exposure in avian field trials.}},

Abstract = {{Metal concentrations were examined in sediments from 497 sites within
   the estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico by the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program
   (EMAP). Data were normalized for extant concentrations of aluminum to
   isolate natural factors from anthropogenic ones, The normalization was
   based on the hypothesis that metal concentrations vary consistently with
   the concentration of aluminum, unless metals are of anthropogenic
   origin. Strong linear correlations (>75\% variation explained) were
   observed between Al and Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn, Moderate correlations
   (50-75\% variation explained) were observed between Al and As or Ag.
   Weak but significant correlations (30-40\% variation explained) were
   observed between Al and Hg or Cd. Based on these results, the spatial
   extent of contamination was examined. About 39\% of sites with
   contamination by at least one metal occurred near population centers,
   industrial discharge sites, or military bases. The remainder of the
   observed contamination represented a dispersed pattern, including the
   lower Mississippi River (7\%) and numerous agricultural watersheds
   (54\%), suggesting that the contamination might be from nonpoint
   sources.}},

   preferred by foxes, whereas open areas were under-utilized. There were
   seasonal variations in habitat use. During summer and autumn, foxes were
   more active in grassland, wooded areas were used more in winter.
   Activity near human settlements was rare, and without any seasonal

Abstract = {{Very little is known about some key variables that would be involved in
   any sound program to conserve biodiversity in temperate forests. For
   example, the distributions of both species and population diversity are
   almost totally unexplored. How well species diversity in different
   groups is correlated at a local scale is unknown; as a result it is
   unclear whether there are any `indicator groups' that can serve as
   surrogates for overall species diversity when designing specific
   conservation projects. Equally, the areal extent of both Mendelian
   populations and demographic units in forests of various types is
   essentially unknown, as is the frequency of occurrence of
   metapopulations.
   There is thus a need for a geographically and ecologically stratified
   sample of studies evaluating patterns of both species and population
   diversity. That sample should also provide information in other areas
   where much more understanding is required for the formulation of sound
   policies. These include issues of: time-scale (maintenance of
   appropriate successional stages and disturbance regimes, the long-term
   viability of heavily harvested forests or plantations, and rates of
   evolutionary response to global change); edge effects and their
   penetration into forest; `vulnerability', including interactions between
   climatic stress and insect infestation, susceptibility to invasions or
   to extinction cascades, and other subtle effects such as habitat
   dilution.
   Such information is essential to judge how easily management practices
   may be adapted to different forests. It can be used to improve
   `internal' conservation strategies: those based on knowledge of the
   systems to be conserved. There are, however, internal strategies whose
   adoption requires no more scientific information than is available now.
   These include a ban on further timber harvesting in old-growth or
   riparian zones; limited harvests in mature second growth with careful
   monitoring; concentration of exploitation in present plantations; and
   restoration of degraded lands to conservation or plantation status.
   `External' strategies are designed to limit and then to reduce the scale
   of human enterprise to make the internal strategies feasible. While what
   needs to be done there is very clear, how to accomplish it is not.
   In the face of all this ignorance, some priorities are suggested for
   research, and some `common sense' strategies of conservation that can be
   used faute de mieux while awaiting more thorough understanding of
   temperate forest ecosystems. The most important is that conservation
   biologists spend much more time on external strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Australia's old growth eucalypt forests are unique, exhibiting a long
   evolutionary history compared with temperate ecosystems on other
   continents. By global comparison, alpha, beta and theta diversity in
   eucalypt forests is also very high; these ecosystems generally support a
   high number of species per site and the change in species and genotypes
   between sites and regions appears high. This has major implications for
   forest management if biodiversity conservation is a serious management
   goal. I consider the legacies of forest uses such as clearing,
   fragmentation, modification and degradation, and present some priorities
   for reform in forest conservation and management.
   Many of the forestry activities in eucalypt forests in eastern Australia
   are not ecologically sustainable. These practices result in significant
   impacts on biodiversity and are detrimental since they can destroy and
   modify complex forest landscapes, ecosystems and the natural
   environmental heterogeneity of systems; destroy, prevent or hinder
   ecological processes that are the basis for species' persistence and
   evolution; destroy or significantly modify the habitat of species; and
   destroy individual organisms and significantly modify populations and
   assemblages of species. Many components of eucalypt forest biodiversity
   are threatened, including various biological and ecological processes,
   many vertebrate and invertebrate fauna, and ecosystem diversity. One
   fundamental concern is the impact of harvesting on populations of
   species and intraspecific genetic diversity. Many current forestry
   activities not only increase the likelihood of the extinction of forest
   species, they also modify the evolutionary potential of species.
   The challenges posed by old growth eucalypt forest management in
   Australia are unique and by virtue of historical events, lie with our
   generation. To our advantage is an appreciation of what reforms are
   required, the availability of adequate knowledge and technology, and an
   understanding of what is at stake. A move towards ecologically
   sustainable forest use in Australia's remaining eucalypt forests
   requires a combination of initiatives including an enhanced conservation
   reserve network, and markedly enhanced protective measures in unreserved
   forest ecosystems, irrespective of land tenure. Significant reductions
   in logging quotas and major changes to current codes of forest practice
   are required if stated biodiversity conservation goals are to be
   achieved. Institutional reforms are required to support these changes as
   is support for long term ecological research and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{At 141 pine-oak barrens in central and northwestern Wisconsin, 3,702
   Karner blues (Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov) were found in 81.1 hr
   of transect surveys during spring and 6,094 individuals in 116.6 hr
   during summer. Adults of five other closely related lycaenids occurred
   with Karner blues. The percentage of Karner blue males (of sexed
   individuals) correlated negatively with advancing date within brood,
   exceeded 50\% on peak date within brood, but showed wide variability on
   a given date. Karner blues occasionally occurred up to 800 m from the
   nearest larval host, or in tiny, isolated host stands. However, all
   individuals were within 3-5 km of other larger Karner blue populations.
   Earner blue abundance significantly increased with decreasing latitude,
   increasing temperature, nearness to midpoint within brood, decreasing
   site canopy, increasing larval host abundance, and in summer compared to
   spring. Long-term monitoring sites showed dramatic but relatively
   similar fluctuations among broods (median of 2.8-fold change among ten
   brood pairs) that apparently varied by individual brood rather than
   season or year. Extensive dense host patches and dense Karner blues were
   in sites representing a diversity of management histories.}},

Title = {{Floral trait variation in Spergularia marina (Caryophyllaceae):
   Ontogenetic, maternal family, and population effects}},
Journal = {{HEREDITY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Traits expressed by modular organisms present difficulties when
   estimating the genetic component to their variation if their phenotype
   changes as an individual ages, confounding ontogenetic and genetic
   sources of phenotypic variation. For such traits, it is necessary to
   control for ontogenetic effects in order to estimate accurately the
   degree of genetic variation in a trait. To measure the magnitude of
   ontogenetic change in floral traits and to determine whether it may
   obscure underlying genetic sources of floral trait variation in the
   autogamous annual, Spergularia marina (Caryophyllaceae), we monitored
   the expression of floral traits over a five-week period in
   greenhouse-raised plants from four California wild populations. From 130
   individuals representing 8-10 maternal families per population, we
   sampled one flower per week to record the number of ovules, normal
   anthers (the number of which is positively correlated with pollen
   production per flower), abnormal anthers (those that grade
   phenotypically into petals), and petals; and the areas of a single petal
   and the entire corolla. All traits except the number of abnormal anthers
   exhibited strong temporal changes in phenotype, although the direction
   and magnitude of the change differed among traits. To determine whether
   populations appear to be evolving independently, we examined differences
   among them in floral trait means, in the magnitude of-among-family
   variation, and in the degree to which they show temporal change in
   floral trait means. There were significant differences among population
   means for all traits except the number of ovules and petals per flower.
   In addition, populations differ in those traits that exhibit significant
   differences among maternal family means. For most traits, populations
   also differ in the magnitude of week-to-week changes in mean phenotype,
   suggesting the presence of genetic variation among populations in the
   expression of temporal change in floral traits. Finally, for most
   traits, the magnitude and significance of differences among populations
   and among maternal family means changed over time. Consequently,
   broad-sense heritability estimates, predictions of the response to
   selection, and measures of interpopulation divergence for floral traits
   are sensitive to the time of flower sampling in S. marina. The role of
   natural selection in moulding ontogenetic variation in floral traits has
   not been extensively studied in any species, but the presence of genetic
   variation among populations observed here suggests that this character
   is open to evolutionary change.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the distribution and abundance of intertidal organisms over
   large areas presents problems to scientists and resource managers
   limited by time, personnel, and funding. The objective of this study was
   to test for a statistical relationship between species abundance and a
   suite of physical factors so that inferences can be made about species
   distributions over large spatial scales if geomorphology is known. This
   has application to oil spill damage assessments, inventory and
   monitoring programs, global change and biodiversity studies where
   economical or logistical constraints dictate a reliance on data
   collected from relatively localized areas but there is a need to
   extrapolate to broad spatial scales. Complex shorelines can be
   partitioned into relatively distinct segments with generally homogenous
   abiotic characteristics. These segments can be characterized using
   common geomorphological parameters, thus differentiating horizontal
   (among-segment) and vertical (within-segment) characteristics. Shoreline
   segments with similar characteristics can then be statistically
   clustered into groups of like habitats. We applied this technique to 5
   km of rocky shoreline on San Juan Island, Washington and then analyzed
   the relationship between 3 clusters of geomorphologically homogenous
   shoreline segments and local floral and faunal abundances. Using
   standard transect techniques at 3 elevations, we compared the variance
   in abundance of organisms (i) among 3 transects within one homogenous
   shoreline segment selected from a moderate-angle bedrock segment
   cluster; (ii) among 3 shoreline segments from the same moderate-angle
   bedrock cluster; and (iii) among 3 separate clusters representing
   low-angle, moderate-angle and high-angle bedrock segments. We
   hypothesized that variance in organismal abundance would be low among
   transects and among similar segments but high among segments from
   different clusters. Data were analyzed using parametric and
   non-parametric one-way ANOVAs for population level comparisons at each
   elevation. Community level comparisons were made using a quantitative
   similarity index (NESS) and a multivariate analysis of variance
   (MANOVA). From the within-segment ANOVAs, we found the population-level
   abundance was not significantly different among transects for 35 out of
   42 comparisons. The among-segment (within cluster) ANOVAs also showed no
   significant differences in abundance for 43 out of 57 comparisons.
   However, abundances varied significantly among dissimilar clusters.
   Signifcant differences were found in 45 out of 58 comparisons. The NESS
   index indicated a higher similarity for communities within a segment,
   and within a cluster, than among samples from different clusters. The
   multivariate test also showed no significant difference among transects
   and among segments (except for a significant difference at the 1 meter
   sampling station), but a very significant difference was computed al all
   three stations for the among clusters analysis. These results suggest
   that by using a systematic approach based on a geomorphological
   classification of the intertidal zone and a limited series of transects,
   intertidal community composition for a complex rocky shoreline over a
   broad spatial scale can be statistically inferred.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding of Hyla elegans was monitored from August 1991 to July 1992 at
   a temporary pond in Ubatuba, State of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil.
   Males began to call as they entered the chorus, and defended their
   calling sites from other males, at times with physical interactions.
   Females, however, were not aggressive toward either males or other
   females. We found a positive correlation between the numbers of females
   and males in the chorus, but no significant correlation between OSR
   (number of reproducing females/number of reproducing males) and the
   number of males present. OSR was highly male-biased; on average, there
   were 10 males for each female; this low OSR may explain low average
   mating success of males. Females chose males as mates freely, and males
   did not attempt to intercept females approaching other males. Males in
   amplexus were larger and heavier than unmated, calling males. In
   addition, snout-vent lengths of males and females in amplexus were
   positively correlated, and males were, on average, 0.81 the length of
   females. Experimentally paired males and females with smaller or larger
   ratios of SVLs had a lower percent of fertilization than pairs near the
   population average.}},

Abstract = {{An 11-year field study was initiated in 1979 to monitor population
   development of Heterodera glycines. Fifty cysts of a race 5 population
   were introduced into plots in a field with no history of soybean
   production and that had been in sod for 20 years. Soybean cultivars
   either susceptible or resistant to H. glycines were grown either in
   monoculture or rotated with maize in a 2-year rotation. During the first
   5 years, resistant cultivars with the Peking source of resistance were
   planted. After year 5, monoculture of Peking resistance resulted in 18
   cysts/250 cm(3) of soil, whereas populations resulting from the
   continuous cropping of susceptible soybean resulted in 45 cysts/250
   cm(3). Some plots in all treatments, including control plots, were
   contaminated at the end of year 5. Crop rotation delayed population
   development of H. glycines. During years 6 through 11 cv. Fayette
   (PI88.788 source of resistance) was planted. In year 6 numbers of cysts
   declined to 1/250 cm(3) of soil in the treatment consisting of
   monocultured Fayette. At the end of year 10, cysts were below the
   detection level in all treatments in which Fayette was planted. Yield of
   susceptible soybean in monoculture with or without H. glycines
   infestation was lower beginning in year 6 when compared to yield of
   soybean grown in rotation and remained lower throughout the duration of
   the experiment except for 1987 (year 9). Yields of susceptible and
   resistant soybean were different each year except for drought years in
   1980 and 1988. From 1979 to 1982 differences in yield were due to lower
   yield potential of resistant cultivars. Except for the drought year,
   yield of cv. Fayette was greater than susceptible Williams 82 during
   years 6 through 11.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of fish-mediated changes on the structure and grazing of
   zooplankton on phytoplankton and bacterioplankton was studied in Lake
   Sobygaard during the period 1984-92 by means of in vitro grazing
   experiments (C-14-labelled phytoplankton, H-3-labelled bacterioplankton)
   and model predictions. Measured zooplankton clearance rates ranged from
   0-25 ml(-1) h(-1) on phytoplankton to 0-33 ml l(-1) h(-1) on
   bacterioplankton. The highest rates were found during the summer when
   Daphnia spp. were dominant. As the phytoplankton biomass was
   substantially greater than that of bacterioplankton throughout the study
   period, ingestion of phytoplankton was 26-fold greater than that of
   bacterioplankton. Multiple regression analysis of the experimental data
   revealed that Daphnia spp., Bosmina longirostris and Cyclops vicinus,
   which were the dominant zooplankton, all contributed significantly to
   the variation in ingestion of phytoplankton, while only Daphnia spp.
   contributed significantly to that of bacterioplankton. Using estimated
   mean values for clearance and ingestion rates for different
   zooplankters, we calculated zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton and
   bacterioplankton on the basis of monitoring data of lake plankton
   obtained during a 9 year study period. Summer mean grazing ranged from 2
   to 4\% of phytoplankton production and 2\% of bacterioplankton
   production to maxima of 53 and 88\%, respectively. The grazing
   percentage decreased with increasing density of planktivorous fish
   caught in August each year using gill nets and shore-line
   electrofishing. The changes along a gradient of planktivorous fish
   abundance seemed highest for bacterioplankton. Accordingly, the
   percentage contribution of bacterioplankton to the total ingestion of
   the two carbon sources decreased from a summer mean value of 8\% in
   Daphnia-dominated communities at lower fish density to 0.7-1.1\% at high
   fish density, when cyclopoid copepods or Bosmina and rotifers dominated.
   Likewise, the percentage of phytoplankton production channelled through
   the bacteria varied, it being highest (5-8\%) at high fish densities. It
   is argued that the negative impact of zooplankton gazing on
   bacterioplankton in shallow lakes is highest at intermediate phosphorus
   levels, under which conditions Daphnia dominate the zooplankton
   community.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal habitat use by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus
   Zimmerman) was monitored with radio telemetry in 1988-89 to determine
   responses to experimental brush treatments, 5-6 years post-treatment, in
   the cross timbers region of central Oklahoma, The study area was a
   mosaic of brush treatments: tebuthiuron
   (N-{[}5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,3,4-thiazol-2-y-1]-N,N'-dimethylurea)
   herbicide, tebuthiuron with an annual spring burn, triclopyr
   ({[}(3,5,6-trichlor-2-pyridinyl)oxy] acetic acid) herbicide, triclopyr
   with an annual spring burn, and no herbicide with annual spring burning,
   Control areas with no burning or herbicide applications also were
   evaluated, Herbicides were applied in 1983, and fires were initiated in
   1985, Annual home range (95\% harmonic mean) averaged 99.9 ha, and no
   differences in size among seasons or between sexes were observed, Both
   sexes selected and avoided specific brush treatments throughout the
   year, Female deer selected or avoided more human-altered habitats in
   specific contrasts of main treatment groups (e.g., treated vs, control,
   herbicide vs, no herbicide, fire vs, no fire, etc.) than males, Both
   sexes selected fire treatments in summer and were most particular in
   their choice of main treatment groups in summer and fall, Habitat use
   between the sexes was most similar in winter and most disparate in fall,
   The mosaic of habitat types resulting from the variable herbicide and
   burn application pattern probably influenced deer habitat use in the
   cross timbers region through combined effects of increased mid-story
   cover and forage production as they relate to reproductive activities
   and nutritional needs of female deer in particular.}},

Abstract = {{We examined contaminant levels in tissue samples of sharp-shinned hawks
   (Accipiter striatus) collected in the eastern U.S. from 1991-93. We
   report concentrations of aldrin, cis-nonachlor, p,p'-DDE, dieldrin,
   heptachlor epoxide, mirex, oxychlordane, PCB, aluminum, lead, and
   mercury detected in 23 blood, 10 brain, and 31 liver samples. DDE,
   PCB's, and mercury were detected most often and in highest
   concentrations. No contaminants were present at concentrations that
   might cause mortality with the possible excep tion of one individual
   with high oxychlordane residues in the liver. It is not known, however,
   at what levels these contaminants might impair reproduction in
   sharg-shinned hawks. Migration count data (declining sharp-shinned hawk
   numbers in the East, stable in the Midwest) coupled with contaminant
   data (higher DDE levels in blood in eastern sharp-shins than in
   midwestern) do not rule out the possibility that contaminants may be
   impairing reproduction in the eastern population, although our data
   suggest that this is unlikely. Further study of contaminant levels in
   sharp-shinned hawks with concurrent research on their productivity and
   on prey availability is necessary. This species also may be an important
   indicator species for monitoring contaminant levels because of their
   high position in the food chain.}},

Abstract = {{In situ germination rate (cells m(-2) d(-1)) and cyst deposition rate
   (cysts m(-2) d(-1)) were monitored for Scrippsiella spp. dinoflagellates
   (mostly S. trochoidea) in Onagawa Bay on the northeastern Pacific coast
   of Japan, using a `germinating cell trap/sampler' and sediment traps,
   respectively. Seasonal relationships of each rate to the abundance of
   vegetative cells in the water column were investigated. Germination of
   the cysts on the surface sediment occurred throughout the year, but the
   germination rate varied seasonally and was strongly correlated with
   temperatures of the bottom water and the sediment, indicating that
   temperature is a principal factor controlling germination. Blooms
   occurred prior to the increase in germination rate in July, indicating
   that bloom initiation is not necessarily a direct consequence of mass
   cyst germination. Seasonal changes in recruitment ratio (ratio of the
   germination rate to standing crops of the vegetative cell population in
   the water column) revealed that, compared to summer, a large part of the
   winter population of vegetative cells was contributed by cyst
   germination but increased germination during periods of warmer
   temperatures contributed Little to the bloom population - on the
   contrary, spring and summer populations appeared to be largely derived
   from vegetative growth. Sexual reproduction and encystment of
   Scrippsiella spp, in natural populations seemed to be enhanced by
   serial, short-term depletion of nutrients during summer. Large
   encystment events appeared to result in bloom termination. These
   findings elucidate the population dynamics of Scrippsiella spp. in
   Onagawa Bay. An annual budget of seed population was also calculated.}},

   set up to survey 14 populations at 12 key sites throughout the range of
   the mohua, in order to document the pattern of population change and
   provide early warning of likely local extinctions. Between 1983 and
   1993, one mohua population became extinct. Five of the 14 populations
   declined significantly, and three of these were on the verge of
   extinction by 1993. One population increased, and seven did-not change
   significantly, although a declining trend was recorded at five of these.
   Six population crashes coincided with irruptions of stoats (Mustela
   erminea) following heavy beech (Nothofagus) seeding.}},

Abstract = {{In the Chihuahuan Desert of the southwestern United States we monitored
   responses of both winter and summer annual plant communities to natural
   environmental variation and to experimental removal of seed-eating
   rodents and ants for 13 years. Analyses of data on population densities
   of the species by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by
   repeated measures analysis of variance (rmANOVA) on PCA scores showed
   that: (1) composition of both winter and summer annual communities
   varied substantially from year to year, presumably in response to
   interannual climatic variation, and (2) community composition of winter
   annuals was also significantly affected by the experimental
   manipulations of seed-eating animals, but the composition of the summer
   annual community showed no significant response to these experimental
   treatments. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was then applied to
   the data for winter annuals to more clearly identify the responses to
   the different classes of experimental manipulations. This analysis
   showed that removing rodents or ants or both taxa caused distinctive
   changes in species composition. There was a tendency for large-seeded
   species to increase on rodent removal plots and to decrease on ant
   removal plots, and for small-seeded species to change in the opposite
   direction. In the winter annual community there was a significant time x
   treatment interaction: certain combinations of species that responded
   differently to removal of granivores also showed opposite fluctuations
   in response to long-term climatic variation. The large year-to-year
   variation in the summer annual community was closely and positively
   correlated across all experimental treatments. The use of multivariate
   analysis in conjunction with long-term monitoring and experimental
   manipulation shows how biotic interactions interact with variation in
   abiotic conditions to affect community dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{To control apple scab disease caused by Venturia inaequalis, aqueous
   extracts from two sources of spent mushroom substrate (SMS),
   anaerobically fermented for 7 days and amended with spreader-sticker,
   were applied at weekly intervals to apple trees (cv. McIntosh) from
   green-tip to petal-fall and biweekly thereafter. Trials were conducted
   for three seasons at two locations in Wisconsin. Both extracts
   significantly reduced (alpha = 0.05) the leaf area affected by scab
   relative to water and spreader-sticker controls as evaluated by the
   Horsfall-Barratt scale. Disease incidence was similarly decreased but to
   a lesser extent. Extracts were not as effective in inhibiting disease as
   captan sprayed at the same intervals. No difference was detected between
   extracts with and without spreader-sticker. Higher populations of
   bacteria, which persisted for at least 1 month after the final spray,
   were detected on leaves treated with the extracts. No differences were
   found in total numbers of fungi. Inhibitory activity of extracts,
   assessed as in vitro inhibition of Venturia conidia germination, was
   monitored over time for extracts prepared from SMS stored under
   different conditions. For one source of SMS, neither time nor storage
   conditions (outdoors uncovered or indoors in sheds) affected inhibitory
   activity of extracts. Decline in efficacy of the other source was

Abstract = {{Density, age structure, and growth rates of wild brook trout (Salvelinus
   fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Whetstone Brook in
   northcentral Massachusetts were monitored for 4 years before and 3 years
   during limestone treatment to mitigate acidic conditions. The population
   density of brook trout increased significantly during treatment. Liming
   did not have any significant effects on the growth rates of brook trout
   or brown trout. Actual survival rates of brook trout and brown trout
   were not calculated due to the low density of both species, but more
   older individuals of both species were captured during the treatment
   period. Fulton condition factors (an index of fish condition) increased
   significantly for both brook trout and brown trout during treatment.
   Seven-day in situ bioassays of brown trout and rainbow trout
   demonstrated that liming improved the chemical environment for fish in
   Whetstone Brook. During a pretreatment bioassay in 1987, 100\% rainbow
   trout mortality was observed at both the control and treatment stations
   in Whetstone Brook. Brown trout mortality was 67\% in the control
   station and 70\% in the treatment station. The pH during the 1987
   bioassay averaged 4.90 in the control station and 4.99 in the treated
   station. During a bioassay conducted in 1990 after treatment began,
   rainbow trout mortality was 100\% in the control station and 0\% in the
   treatment station. Brown trout mortality was 17\% in the control station
   and 0\% in the treatment station. The pH during the 1990 bioassay
   averaged 5.23 in the control station and 6.60 in the treatment station.
   Analysis of total aluminum in the gills of fish from the 1990 bioassay
   revealed higher levels in fish from the control station than in those
   from the treatment station.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the invertebrate fauna in Whetstone Brook for 3 years
   before and after limestone treatment to mitigate low pH conditions
   caused by acid precipitation. Sampling was conducted during the spring,
   summer, and fall by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The fauna
   in Whetstone Brook in the control and treatment sections was dominated
   by chironomids (Diptera), simuliids (Diptera), Leuctra (Plecoptera) and
   Hydropsyche (Trichoptera) in both pretreatment and treatment periods.
   The acid-sensitive mayfly genera Epeorus increased during liming in the
   treated section of the stream but also declined during the same period
   in the control section. Annelida increased during the treatment period
   in both sections of the stream. The chironomid and black fly populations
   were not affected by liming. The lack of impact to the black fly
   population was surprising because larvae are obligate filter-feeders and
   feed on suspended seston in the same size range as the limestone slurry
   that was used to treat Whetstone Brook. Treatment did not change species
   diversity and taxa richness in the treated section of Whetsone Brook,
   but both indices declined during the treatment period in the control
   section of Whetstone Brook. This decline was attributed to the poorer
   water quality of the untreated section of Whetstone Brook during the
   treatment period, which was due to higher-than-average precipitation.
   Percent community similarity analysis indicated that the community
   composition changed more in the treated section of Whetstone Brook than
   in the control section as a result of treatment. We conclude that the
   invertebrate fauna in the treated section of Whetstone Brook was not
   negatively affected by liming, but that population density and diversity
   did not increase.}},

Abstract = {{Three experiments under laboratory condition were conducted to study the
   effect of temperature and female size, measured as prosome length and
   dry weight, on egg production and egg viability of Calanus chilensis
   Brodsky captured from the Bay of Mejillones, northern Chile. In the
   first experiment egg spawning was monitored every 2 hours in Females
   kept in individual vials at five constant temperatures. namely 9, 12,
   15, 18 and 20 degrees C. In a second experiment, temperature was
   constant, 15 degrees C. Finally, a third experiment was conducted at
   three constant temperatures, 12, 15 and 20 degrees C under excess of
   food to determine temperature effects on egg production for a more
   extended period of rime. As food, a monoculture of Isochrysis galbana
   Parke was used For the first experiment and phytoplankton collected from
   tile same Bay cultured in F2 medium was used for the second and third
   experiments. In the first experiment clutch size (CS), defined as the
   total number of eggs laid at once within a 2 h period, ranged between 5
   and 84 eggs female(-1). In most cases all the eggs were able to hatch
   and those that did not hatch were assumed as nonviable. CS was
   positively correlated to temperature, but only 2 out of 12 females were
   able to lay eggs at the lowest temperature (9 degrees C), whereas at the
   highest temperature (20 degrees C) CS tended to decline. There was a
   lack of synchrony in egg laying and no temperature effect on the number
   of nonviable eggs was detected. However a significant positive
   correlation between CS and the number of nonviable eggs was found
   (F-1,F-25=4.67, P<0.05). In the second experiment CS was highly
   variable, 36+/-degrees 18.67 (mean degrees S.D.) and not associated with
   either female length (F-1,F-26=1.86, P>0.05), or with female dry weight
   (F-1,F-26=0.026, P>0.05). Finally from the third experiment, egg
   production on a daily basis, was drastically reduced at 20 degrees C,
   while differences between 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C were not
   detected. Our results agree with previous studies indicating that egg
   production correlates positively with temperature. However, there
   appears to be an `'optimal temperature range'', within which maximal
   clutch sizes and daily egg production rates are attained. This
   temperature range coincides with that observed at the upper 10 m layer
   in the study area. This suggests that maximal egg production rates of
   this species would only take place at the upper layer. On the other
   hand, sharp population declines, such as that observed during `'El
   Nino'' 1991-92, may have been caused by abrupt changes in water
   temperature giving rise to a poor recruitment, because of depleted egg
   production taking place at temperatures greater than 20 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty about the environmental effects of oil development prompted
   a study of Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma in the nearshore waters of the
   Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska. Abundance of fish less than 400
   mm fork length (FL), as indexed by fyke net catch per unit effort
   (CPUE), was significantly different among years, with the highest daily
   catch rates occurring in 1991, a year of heavy pack ice and relatively
   cold water temperatures. The CPUE for fish 400 mm or greater did not
   differ significantly among years. Within each sampling year, both large
   and small fish appeared to be more abundant in nearshore waters earlier
   in the summer. Lengths ranged from 53 to 734 mm. Growth was greater
   early in the season and in the years 1989 and 1990, and site-specific
   temporal changes in distribution were reflected in analysis of length
   data. Individual fish were aged at 1-13 years. A gonadosomatic index
   indicated that sexually mature fish were greater than 400 mm FL. Wide
   summer dispersal makes Dolly Varden less vulnerable to local coastal
   perturbations during the summer; however, vulnerability may be greater
   for stocks that must migrate seasonally through particular areas (e.g.,
   a river mouth during fall migrations). The significant differences in
   local abundance patterns makes effective monitoring of the overall
   population size difficult. Monitoring spawners or overwintering fish in
   freshwater may be a more accurate means of assessing overall abundance
   trends.}},

Abstract = {{Although the value of long-term studies generally is recognized, we
   found no extensive assessment of the benefits and pitfalls associated
   with such studies. We used our 28-year study of black bears (Ursus
   americanus) in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) to identify
   the elements of long-term research that have advanced our knowledge of
   black bear ecology and the factors that compromised our efforts. We used
   a consistent, annual trapping period combined with an intensive and
   continuous effort to monitor reproduction and mortality. Our long-term
   population estimates indicated that our interpretations of population
   dynamics would have been different had the studies ended after 5 or 10
   years, an illustration of how short-term views can be misleading. Other
   benefits of the long-term study related to hypothesis testing, research
   techniques, long-term observations, use of stored samples and data,
   technology transfer, and practical applications. The main problems we
   encountered in sustaining this research were interpreting results,
   maintaining research funding, finding appropriate study areas,
   maintaining communication with cooperators, dealing with large datasets,
   and maintaining consistency, continuity, and creativity. We recommend
   that The Wildlife Society prepare a position statement on the value of
   long-term studies.}},

   the proportions of kits in the harvest and in the population. I aged
   90\% of lynx correctly from pelt-length data. Incorrect ages could not
   be attributed to specific age or sex classes. I estimated the dividing
   point (D) between kits and adults to be less than or equal to 90.5 cm
   for Yukon lynx pelt lengths. calculated a correction factor (CF) to
   convert pelt-sample age ratios to population age ratios. A CF of 1.19
   was required for a harvest season of 1 November to 10 March, however the
   CF varied due to monthly harvest bias of kits. Harvest restrictions are

Abstract = {{We conducted simulations that estimated power and Type I error rates of
   statistical tests for detecting trends in raptor population count data
   collected from a single monitoring site. Results of the simulations were
   used to help analyze count data of bald eagles (Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus) from 7 national forests in Michigan, Minnesota, and
   Wisconsin during 1980-1989. Seven statistical tests were evaluated,
   including simple linear regression on the log scale and linear
   regression with a permutation test. Using 1,000 replications each, we
   simulated n = 10 and n = 50 years of count data and trends ranging from
   -5 to 5\% change/year. We evaluated the tests at 3 critical levels
   (alpha = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10) for both upper- and lower-tailed tests.
   Exponential count data were simulated by adding sampling error with a
   coefficient of variation of 40\% from either a log-normal or
   autocorrelated log-normal distribution. Not surprisingly, tests
   performed with 50 years of data were much more powerful than tests with
   10 years of data. Positive autocorrelation inflated alpha-levels upward
   from their nominal levels, making the tests less conservative and more
   likely to reject the null hypothesis of no trend. Of the tests studied,
   Cox and Stuart's test and Pollard's test clearly had lower power than
   the others. Surprisingly, the linear regression t-test, Collins' linear
   regression permutation test, and the nonparametric Lehmann's and Mann's
   tests all had similar power in our simulations. Analyses of the count
   data suggested that bald eagles had increasing trends on at]east 2 of
   the 7 national forests during 1980-1989.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the ability, or statistical power, of track
   surveys to detect a change in abundance of cougars (Puma concolor). We
   examined monitoring schemes that would have 80\% power to detect a 30\%
   or 50\% change in track abundance between 2 survey periods. We used data
   from track transects in southeastern Arizona to evaluate survey designs
   for 8-km transects in first- and second-order dry washes. Track density
   (number of 0.5-km segments with tracks along an 8-km transect) followed
   a Poisson distribution, with no serial correlation between consecutive
   surveys of a given transect. We used simulated Poisson data to determine
   how power varied in response to number of 8-km transects, risk of Type I
   error, direction of change (increase or decrease), magnitude of change
   (30\% or 50\%), and whether track density between surveys changed
   uniformly or patchily across transects. Power decreased only slightly
   when change in track density was patchy. Track transects had low power
   to detect increases in track density (e.g., about 190 transects would be
   needed to detect a 30\% increase with 80\% power and alpha = 0.05), but
   somewhat more power to detect decreases (about 140 transects would
   detect a 30\% decrease with 80\% power at alpha = 0.05). Managers san
   increase the power of surveys (or decrease the number of transects) if a
   10-20\% risk of Type I error is acceptable, i.e., about 140 transects
   would be needed to detect a 30\% decrease in track density with 80\%
   power at alpha = 0.05, 110 transects at alpha = 0.10 and 85 transects at
   alpha = 0.20. If surveys need to detect only large decreases (50\%),
   track surveys are more powerful, with only about 50 transects needed for
   80\% power at alpha = 0.05, and 30 transects at alpha = 0.20. Thus,
   track surveys usually will not detect small annual changes, but may
   reveal large changes more efficiently than other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Quebec's EPOQ program compiles birders' `'checklists,'' each of which
   reports numbers of birds seen on one day at one site. We analyzed EPOQ
   data from the migration season alone (1971-92), to see if these
   unstandardized counts might monitor trends in populations that nest
   farther north. Two sets of trends were computed for each of 58 species,
   from annual indices based either on abundance or on frequency of
   detection. Both spring EPOQ trends were significantly correlated with
   Breeding Bird Survey trends for Quebec, while only those based on
   abundance performed well in fall. There was a positive bias in magnitude
   of EPOQ trends, but negative EPOQ trends were reliable indicators of
   negative BBS trends. Analysis of sub-sets of the data showed that sample
   size had little qualitative effect. Checklist data should not be relied
   on for quantitative population monitoring, but they do contain useful
   information for detection or corroboration of negative trends.}},

Title = {{Differential anaerobic decomposition of seagrass (Zostera noltii) and
   macroalgal (Monostroma obscurum) biomass from Arcachon Bay (France)}},
Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},

Abstract = {{Arcachon Bay is characterized by extensive meadows of the seagrass
   Zostera noltii. Moreover, as a consequence of eutrophication, massive
   proliferations of the macroalga (Monostroma obscurum) have occurred
   since the beginning of 1990s.
   This paper describes the anaerobic decomposition of biomass of both
   species under experimental conditions by two methods. Firstly, the
   dynamics of decomposition were studied in situ using litter bags. The
   remaining biomass and the elemental composition of the decomposing
   macrophytes were monitored. Secondly, degradation was studied in
   experimental containers under anoxic conditions in which the release of
   inorganic nutrients and the development of fermentative and
   sulfate-reducing bacterial populations were followed.
   The decomposition rate of total biomass was faster for macroalgae than
   for the vascular plants, thus corroborating previous observations.
   However, both in situ and laboratory experiments showed that the
   anaerobic decomposition of the seagrass Z. noltii resulted in rapid
   release of inorganic N and P, and increasing C/N and C/P ratios of the
   residual biomass. As a result, the recycling of inorganic nitrogen and
   phosphorus compounds was slightly more efficient for Z. noltii than for
   M. obscurum. Recycling of inorganic nutrients appears to be of a great
   importance to the whole ecosystem, because of the extensive spreading of
   Z. noltii in the bay.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous attempts have been made to restore the declining California
   abalone fisheries by outplanting of hatchery-produced seed. Poor
   survival of planted seed has been generally attributed to predation and
   emigration, lessening enthusiasm for reseeding efforts, We present
   genetic evidence that one large-scale outplanting of red abalone
   (Haliotis rufescens) in southern California was effective, and document
   changes in the genetic composition of red abalone populations
   accompanying hatchery propagation. Allozymes appeared to behave as
   neutral and therefore effective markers for tracking population
   bottlenecks in hatchery production and reseeded populations. Careful
   monitoring of hatchery breeding practices is essential for both
   commercial production and artificial reseeding programs.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate potential links between marine pollution and
   fish diseases, an epizootiological study was conducted in The
   Netherlands during 1983-89. This study concentrated on grossly
   identifiable diseases of flounder Platichthys flesus. Flounder were
   found to be affected by the viral skin disease lymphocystis and by skin
   ulcers probably of bacterial origin. Overall prevalences of these 2
   diseases in fish greater than or equal to 2 yr old were 14.3\% end 2.8\%
   respectively. Also notable was the presence of neoplastic nodules in the
   livers of 1.0\% of the population, prevalences rising steeply with age
   and locally attaining values of up to 30\% in 6+ yr old fish. Most of
   the samples were collected in September when flounder are resident in
   inshore feeding areas. Using data from 9 sites, spatial and temporal
   (year-to-year) variation in disease occurrence was analysed
   statistically using log-linear models which incorporated possible
   effects of length, age and sex. Year-to-year variation showed little
   correspondence among the 3 diseases, but their spatial distributions
   showed striking similarities. Lymphocystis and skin ulcers were
   associated in individual fish. The observed variation in disease
   prevalence showed no significant correlation with condition factor of
   the fish or with concentrations of contaminants in sediments or tissues.
   However, disease prevalences at different sites showed a strong positive
   correlation with fishing activity (possibly indicating an effect of
   damage by fishing gear) and appeared also to be positively related to
   salinity. When only strictly marine sites were considered, a
   relationship With pollution could not be ruled out. Additional data
   collected in February-April at offshore sites indicated that disease
   prevalences were generally higher at this time of the year, which
   corresponds to the spawning period of the populations studied. This
   trend was particularly pronounced for liver neoplasms, and might be
   partly related to a low condition factor resulting from spawning
   activities. In view of the different aetiologies of the 3 diseases, the
   similarities in spatial patterns indicate the existence of 1 general
   underlying mechanism of disease causation, perhaps acting through
   immunosuppressive effects. However, age-related migration appeared to
   explain some aspects of the spatial pattern of liver neoplasms, whereas
   it was less important in the case of epidermal diseases, which develop
   more rapidly. On the basis of the findings of this study, the possible
   contribution of pollution to disease prevalence cannot be adequately
   assessed due to the interfering effects of other factors (salinity,
   fishing activity, migration and spawning). Disease causation appears to
   be complex, and it may be that effects of pollution interact with those
   of other factors to produce observed spatial patterns.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the detailed histopathological analysis of livers of
   flounder Platichthys flesus sampled in Dutch coastal and estuarine
   waters during 1985-89. In conjunction with an epizootiological study of
   grossly identifiable diseases st 10 sampling locations, a total of 210
   livers (1 \% of sampled population) showing gross nodular lesions
   (diameter >2 mm) and 315 livers showing no gross pathology were
   collected. Of the 210 livers with grossly observable nodules, 67 \% were
   diagnosed as having neoplasms. The majority of these neoplasms were
   identified as hepatocellular adenoma; 13.1 \% were diagnosed as
   hepatocellular carcinoma. Most of the remaining nodules were diagnosed
   as foci of cellular alteration, which are considered to be preneoplastic
   lesions. Routine histopathological examination of livers showing no
   gross pathology resulted in the identification of a range of lesions
   including hepatocellular adenoma, foci of cellular alteration, hydropic
   vacuolization of biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes, inflammatory
   lesions, focal necrosis, regenerative foci, and fibrillar hepatocytes of
   unknown significance. In addition, indices were used to quantify the
   presence of storage vacuoles (glycogen and lipid) and the relative
   density of melanomacrophage centres. The results indicate that a small
   proportion of neoplasms would be missed if only livers with grossly
   detectable nodules were subjected to histological examination. The
   prevalence of foci of cellular alteration at the different sampling
   sites showed a good correspondence with that of neoplasms, providing
   support for the hypothesis that these conditions represent stages of the
   same process. Of the other lesions and quantitative indices, only
   hydropic vacuolization of biliary epithelial cells had a spatial
   distribution similar to that of neoplasms. It is concluded that liver
   neoplasms and especially their precursor lesions in flounder are
   promising tools for monitoring exposure to potential carcinogens,
   provided that migration patterns are explicitly taken into account.
   Furthermore, experimental studies are needed to investigate the chemical
   agents responsible for the onset of these early lesions and their
   progression into neoplasms, and also to evaluate the contribution of
   other environmental and host-related factors.}},

Abstract = {{A progeny of the native Florida cycad Zamia integrifolia grown from
   seeds planted in 1986 was monitored until 1995 to record mortality and
   the nature and time of expression of primary and secondary sex
   characters. In addition to gender-specific cone morphologies, males and
   females differed in secondary sex characters such as age at first cone
   production, frequency of cone production, mean cone numbers in second
   and later coning episodes, and, in older plants, mean leaf and branch
   numbers. Gender differences expressed themselves at different stages in
   the life history: their nature and extent varied during the years
   following sexual maturation. By 1995, 46\% of the plants in the progeny
   had died, most of them before producing cones. Prior to 1988 the mean
   leaf number of plants that died did not differ from that of survivors,
   but the mean leaf number of plants dying between 1988 and 1989 was 0.4
   times that of the survivors during that period, suggesting reduced vigor
   prior to death. Mean age at first cone production was 5.8 yr for males
   and 6.6 yr for females. Mean dry masses of individual male cones
   increased between the first and second coning episodes, but not between
   the second and third coning episodes. Mean dry masses of the entire cone
   crop of individual males increased through the third coning episode due
   to an increase in mean cone number per episode, but mean cone number was
   unchanged between the third and fourth coning episodes. Mean dry mass of
   unpollinated female cones did not change between the first and second
   coning episodes; mean cone numbers did not change between the first and
   third coning episodes. After the first coning episode, males produced
   higher mean cone numbers than females. By 1995, the mean dry mass of an
   individual male's cone crop was greater than that of a female. Coning
   frequency of males was 1.7 times greater than that of unpollinated
   females, suggesting a gender difference in the genetic control of coning
   frequency. Coning frequency of females pollinated 1 or 2 yr previously
   was reduced compared with that of unpollinated females. Cone production
   did not affect subsequent leaf production by either gender, Mean leaf
   numbers increased in some years and not in others. Mean leaf numbers of
   males and females did not differ prior to cone production. After cone
   production mean leaf numbers of males were greater than of females. Mean
   age of males producing first branches was 6.3 yr, with a mean of 2.5
   first branches per plant. Mean age of females producing first branches
   was 7.7 yr, with a mean of 2.5 first branches per plant. By 1995 the
   mean branch number of males was 5.7 per plant and of females was 2.7 per
   plant. Between 1993 and 1995 the mean branch number of males and females
   increased incrementally, but mean leaf numbers did not change. In early
   years of branching, leaf number increased with branch number; higher
   mean leaf numbers of males of an age class thus reflected their earlier
   branching. Males produced first cones earlier than females. Since branch
   production was associated with cone production, higher branch numbers of
   males in an age class reflected their earlier first cone production. In
   1995 the sex ratio of known males and females in the progeny was 1:1,
   with a few individuals not having produced cones by that year.}},

Abstract = {{Moss monitoring, a common bioindication method, was used to investigate
   temporal changes of atmospheric trace element deposition since the 1960s
   in the Fraser Valley, British Columbia. Vancouver, Canada's third
   largest metropolitan area, is located in the west of the Fraser Valley
   and has a significant effect on the air quality of the region. Changes
   in atmospheric deposition of lead, cadmium, chromium, nickel, zinc, and
   manganese were estimated by analyzing local samples of the common
   woodland moss Isothecium stoloniferum Brid. collected during three
   different time periods: 1960-1966, 1975-1980, and 1993. A significant
   decrease was found for lead, cadmium, chromium, nickel, and zinc, when
   samples from 1960-1966 were compared with those collected in 1993. The
   declining metal levels are associated with a change in industrial
   activity, a reduction in fuel oil combustion for space heating, and
   abandonment of leaded gasoline. Manganese concentration in the moss
   samples increased significantly over the past 30 years. This increase
   might be related to the replacement of the antiknock additive,
   tetraethyl lead, with methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl. The
   present study shows how changes in human activity can affect and
   counterbalance increasing pressure from a fast-growing population in
   respect to trace element pollution.}},

Abstract = {{A resident population of 13 black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) persist
   in Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. The effective population size (N-e) may
   be as few as 5 animals. Projected growth for this population suggests
   that the effective population size will remain small for the near
   future, threatening this local population with extinction due to the
   stochastic factors associated with small population size. A summary of
   historic and recent demographic data for this population reveals a
   population crash during the period of heavy poaching that affected this
   species throughout its range. Although poaching of this species has been
   brought under control, the population remains small. These data and
   models of projected population growth argue for consideration of
   more-intensive management within the framework of the small population
   paradigm. This case is an example of applied conservation resulting from
   this paradigm used in conjunction with rather than competing with the
   declining population paradigm. We identify additional monitoring,
   particularly of density-dependent behaviors, that will be necessary for
   designing a successful management program. Finally, the use of molecular
   markers for developing an accurate pedigree for this population is
   suggested in order to maintain a genetically healthy population. These
   strategies have broad applicability to black rhinoceros conservation
   throughout Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of arctic-alpine plants at the southern periphery of their
   range should respond rapidly to projected global warming. We established
   a study to monitor the density and reproductive effort of six such
   species in tundra of Glacier National Park, Montana to help project the
   fate of these species in the center of their range. For many species,
   detecting long-term population trends is confounded by short-term
   variation. Our study design employs temporal resampling of permanent
   plots on multiple sites and a repeated-measures model that accommodates
   the effects of high frequency variation and allows assessment of the
   significance of long-term trends. Statistical analysis compares
   site-specific estimates of annual mean density between two time periods
   and uses between-plot, within-site, within-year variation to estimate
   error. Power calculations using data from the 3-yr baseline period
   indicate that measurements of fecundity will be less sensitive for
   detecting long-term trends than measurements of plant density.
   Furthermore, our results suggest that perennial species of closed-turf
   communities may be better bioassays of long-term change than annuals or
   species of open, ephemeral microsites.}},

Abstract = {{1. The densities of insect herbivores in fertilized and unfertilized
   field plots of goldenrods, Solidago altissima (Compositae), were
   monitored over a period of 4 years.
   2. A total of seventeen insect taxa occurred on the plots over the
   course of the study, including sap feeders, leaf chewers, leaf miners,
   leaf gallers and stem gallers with multiple representatives in each of
   these feeding guilds.
   3. Nine of the seventeen taxa significantly increased in density on
   fertilized plots in at least one year of the study, two taxa showed
   marginally significant increases on fertilized plots, two significantly
   decreased in density on fertilized plots in at least one year, and the
   remaining taxa were unaffected by the fertilizer treatment.
   4. The effects of fertilization on the insects were not strongly related
   to feeding guild; the group of insects that increased on fertilized
   plots was functionally diverse, and for the most part members of the
   same guild did not respond to the fertilizer treatment in consistent
   ways.
   5. Differences between fertilized and unfertilized plots were greatest
   in the fourth year. The insects that showed delayed responses to
   fertilizer treatment may have been affected by changes in microclimate
   that developed slowly over the course of the study, suggesting that
   long-term studies may be necessary to detect effects of host plant
   stress on insect herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Forest application of diflubenzuron (DFB) is commonly used in
   mid-Atlantic states for control of gypsy moths in hardwood forests. To
   assess effects of the pesticide on nontarget organisms, DFB (Dimilin)
   was applied by helicopter on May 16, 1992, to two watersheds in the
   Fernow Experimental Forest near Parsons, West Virginia. To determine if
   aquatic macroinvertebrates were affected by the aerial spray, we
   monitored streams in two reference and two treatment watersheds before
   and after treatment with DFB using a multilevel artificial substrate
   sampler, The before-after-control-impact-pairs (BACIP) analysis was used
   to test for differences in aquatic macroinvertebrate densities between
   treated and reference watersheds. Densities of some taxa in DFB-treated
   watersheds either showed population depressions or did not increase in
   density after drought conditions as compared with those taxa in streams
   in reference watersheds, whereas other taxa increased in treated
   watersheds. Taxa that had reduced mean densities in treatment watersheds
   (alpha = 0.05) included the stoneflies, Leuctra sp, and Isoperla sp.,
   the mayfly, Paraleptophlebia sp., and the crane fly, Hexatoma sp.
   Shredders, the dominant functional feeding group, also had reduced mean
   densities in treatment watersheds. Densities of Oligochaeta and
   Turbellaria increased in streams in treated watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of aquatic invertebrates to a C-14-15 linear alcohol
   ethoxylate (LAE) nonionic surfactant with an average of seven ethylene
   oxide units per mole of alcohol were evaluated in outdoor stream
   mesocosms. Two experiments were carried out to evaluate responses of
   aquatic invertebrates to 28- and 30-d exposures in eight stream
   mesocosms, Changes in benthic invertebrate densities and in invertebrate
   drift were monitored during pretreatment, treatment, and posttreatment
   periods. In Experiment 1, mean measured concentrations of surfactant
   were 0.08, 0.16, and 0.33 mg LAE/L. In Experiment 2, mean measured
   concentrations were 0.11, 0.28, and 0.55 mg LAE/L. In each experiment,
   there were two treated streams at each surfactant concentration and two
   untreated streams that served as controls. No significant effects (p >
   0.05) on population densities of Copepoda, Cladocera, Chironomidae,
   Nematoda, or Annelida were observed in either experiment. Moreover, no
   effects were detected on the numbers of any of these organisms collected
   in drift nets. However, there was a significant decrease (p less than or
   equal to 0.05) in the densities of Simuliidae at surfactant
   concentrations greater than or equal to 0.16 mg LAE/L. This was
   accompanied by an increase in the numbers of Simuliidae collected in
   drift nets; Based on these results, the no-observed-effect concentration
   for aquatic invertebrates was 0.08 mg LAE/L, and the
   lowest-observed-effect concentration was 0.16 mg LAE/L.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial discs were used to monitor the settlement and development of
   Fucus serratus propagules in five areas cleared of an adult canopy, in
   order to test the assumptions that sizes of recently settled propagules
   are normally distributed but that over time plant sizes become more
   variable and hierarchical. Settlement was spatially (3-20 m) variable
   only at the beginning and end of the settlement period, and at the time
   when most settlement took place (88\% in a fortnight) no differences
   between areas were found. Increases in the skewness coefficient, Gini
   coefficient and coefficient of variation confirmed that there was not a
   size hierarchy in the recently settled population, but 8 months later
   sizes of plants were variable and a positive skew in plant sizes (many
   small and few big) developed. Mortality was high at first (70\% in 1
   month) but fell considerably later. F. serratus behaves like most higher
   plants with respect to changing population structure. The observed
   change in population structure provided evidence of how a `'seed bank''
   develops in an algal population, as 1 year after settlement an estimated
   37 000 plants m(-1) are still <1 mm in length.}},

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{1. Egg masses, oviposition site preferences, and abiotic and biotic
   factors causing mortality during embryonic, larval and adult life stages
   of Apatania fimbriata were studied. Laboratory investigations provided
   information on the temperature dependence of embryonic development,
   measured as an increase in egg volume.
   2. A. fimbriata laid hemispherical egg masses, consisting of a
   transparent matrix containing a mean of 208 eggs. Egg masses were laid
   on stones situated just above the water surface in dark cavities in the
   stream bank.
   3. Two hundred egg masses were mapped and individually monitored during
   embryonic development. There was no significant correlation between
   mortality during embryonic development and any of the abiotic parameters
   measured. First-instar larvae of Osmylus fulvicephalus consumed
   developing eggs, and chironomids preyed on newly hatched larvae.
   4. A mean of seventy-two females emerged per metre of stream. Mortality
   during the 1993/94 life cycle was measured as a percentage of the
   potential number of eggs laid. Female mortality between emergence and
   oviposition was approximate to 80\%. Eight per cent of individuals were
   lost during embryonic development. Larval mortality to emergence in 1994
   was 11.3\%. This indicates that the terrestrial life stage is probably
   decisive in the regulation of A. fimbriata populations.
   5. Duration of embryogenesis at constant temperatures (4-20 degrees C)
   in the laboratory was described best by a negative exponential function.
   This species is cold stenothermal and there was no hatching success at
   20 degrees C.
   6. Egg volumes during embryonic development increased sigmoidally over
   time.}},

Abstract = {{1. Assemblages of epilithic diatoms, macrophytes, benthic
   macroinvertebrates and fish were monitored over a 5-year period
   (1988-92) in ten lakes and nine streams in the U.K., as part of the U.K.
   Acid Waters Monitoring Network. All organisms were categorized according
   to their functional or morphological characteristics and integrated to
   describe the food web at each site. In general, the flora and fauna of
   all sites were typical of oligotrophic, softwater systems subject to
   various degrees of acidification.
   2. Salmonids were the only fish caught at any site and brown trout were
   the dominant species. With only 5 years of data it was not possible to
   test for directional changes in fish populations at each site. Among
   sites, fish density was positively associated with pH, and this did not
   vary between lake outflows and streams or between fish of different age
   class (0 +, greater than or equal to 1 +). Condition factor, reflecting
   fish health, was not associated with pH among sites, but was negatively
   associated with fish density and, on average, was higher for fish in
   streams than those in lake outflows.
   3. Variability in the diatom, macrophyte and invertebrate data sets were
   quantified in three ways using multivariate techniques: species turnover
   or replacement (temporal variation due to directional change),
   persistence (the reciprocal of between-year variability) and within-year
   variability (heterogeneity between sample replicates). For all groups,
   turnover was relatively low and persistence was high. The least
   persistent macrophyte assemblages occurred in stream sites and this may
   reflect high inter-annual variation in the cover of filamentous algae
   which are prone to scouring. Within-year variability was higher than
   turnover or between-year variability for the diatoms and invertebrates,
   and highest values were recorded for lake invertebrates.
   4. Redundancy analysis, RDA was used to test the diatom, macrophyte,
   invertebrate and food web data for evidence of directional changes over
   time and its significance was assessed using Monte Carlo permutation
   tests. These tests appeared robust to temporal and spatial variability
   in the data set. Significant trends could be identified in some data
   sets despite considerable between-replicate and non-linear between-year
   variability.
   5. Significant linear trends in at least one biological group were found
   at eight lake and seven stream sites. Only one lake and one stream had
   significant trends in all four groups. These trends represent changes in
   the flora and/or fauna, but they can be interpreted in several different
   ways. Only six sites showed trends that were consistent with our
   knowledge of species' responses to water chemistry: three indicated
   increased acidity and three indicated decreased acidity. At only one
   site were the biological results consistent with observed chemical
   changes and there was disagreement at the other five. Of the other nine
   sites that showed biological changes, two appeared to reflect known
   physical habitat disturbances; the other seven remain unexplained.}},

Abstract = {{1. Larval density, size of pheromone-trapped adult males, and survival
   and parasitism rates in the laboratory of field-collected larvae of
   Epirrita autumnata were investigated along three pollution gradients:
   the surroundings of smelters at Monchegorsk and Nikel in north-western
   Russia and a factory complex at Harjavalta, south-western Finland.
   2. Along the gradients, the emissions are qualitatively similar,
   consisting mainly of Cu, Ni and SO,, but the amounts emitted vary. Cu
   and Ni concentrations in birch (Betula pubescens) leaves, a common diet
   of E. autumnata larvae, were monitored and used as general indices of
   pollution.
   3. High Cu and/or Ni concentrations in birch foliage, and/or associated
   changes in other pollutants, were associated with detrimental effects on
   E. autumnata performance. They occurred when concentrations of foliage
   Cu and/or Ni exceeded 20-30 mu g g(-1).
   4. In the Harjavalta and Monchegorsk gradients, crossing the above
   threshold values in heavy metal concentrations in the foliage, larval
   density and survival increased significantly with distance from the
   smelters. No pollution-related trends with distance were found either
   for male size or for larval parameters in that section of the Nikel
   gradient where foliage heavy metals were below this threshold value.
   5. Parasitism rates were not associated with pollution, indicating that
   parasitoids were not differently sensitive to pollutants than their
   herbivorous host.
   6. No indication was found of a positive effect of moderate pollution on
   E. autumnata and heavy pollution had detrimental effects. The results do
   not suggest that the species might become a severe pest in polluted
   areas outside its natural outbreak range.}},

Abstract = {{The relative toxicities of bifenthrin and endosulfan to silverleaf
   whiteflies, Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Perring, were compared by 2
   methods-treated glass vials and insecticide-coated yellow sticky
   cards-in tests in 4 field populations from cotton in Imperial Valley,
   California. Both techniques detected relative susceptibilities of B.
   argentifolii adults to bifenthrin and endosulfan. The LC(50)s of
   bifenthrin ranged from 0.007 to 0.07 mu g/vial for the 4 populations
   with the vial technique and from 0.77 to 3.55 mu g(AI)/ml with the
   yellow sticky card technique. Relative tolerance levels to bifenthrin
   ranging from 2.2- to 10.1-fold were observed in the 4 populations with
   the yellow sticky card technique. The vial technique showed lower
   relative response levels (0.2- to 2.3-fold). With endosulfan, the range
   was similar for both techniques, (1.2- to 5.1-fold with vials; 0.5- to
   7.0-fold with the yellow sticky card technique). The frequency of
   resistance to 4 insecticides compared with a greenhouse susceptible
   strain was evaluated with the vial system against 11 populations of
   silverleaf whiteflies collected from various crops in Imperial Valley
   during 1992. Resistance to endosulfan was substantial (maximum,
   48-fold), but relative tolerance was considerably lower to bifenthrin
   (RR = 0.4- to 8-fold). The insecticide-coated yellow sticky card
   technique was used for monitoring in Imperial Pale Verde, and San
   Joaquin Valleys in California in the following year. Considerable
   differences in resistance ratios for the 4 insecticide treatments were
   observed among whitefly populations from the 3 geographic regions.
   Bioassays indicated that methomyl was effective against adults in all
   locations.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of Gyrodactylus salaris, an important pathogen of the
   Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in Norway, to infect anadromous and resident
   stocks of the Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus has been examined in the
   laboratory. Resident charr (Korssjoen stock) exposed to heavily infected
   salmon, were considered innately resistant as they lost their infections
   within 21 days when individually isolated. Isolated anadromous charr
   (Hammerfest stock) remained infected for up to 150 days, although most
   infections disappeared within 30-50 days. In many cases the parasite
   population grew initially, bur growth was limited after 20-30 days and
   infections subsequently disappeared. At the same time, shoals of 50
   anadromous charr, swimming in the tanks containing the individually
   isolated fish in floating cages, remained infected for up to 280 days.
   Charr isolated from these shoals after 115 days and subsequently
   monitored individually lost their infections within 30 days, although
   the parasite persisted within the shoals for a further 75-135 days. This
   suggests that G. salaris persisted on shoaling charr despite an immune
   response which led to the elimination of parasites from isolated hosts.
   The Hammerfest stock of anadromous charr supports G. salaris in the
   laboratory, and the extended period of survival on this host suggests
   that charr may be important in the epidemiology of G. salaris in
   northern Norway. (C) 1996 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles}},

Abstract = {{A major timber-preservative spillage, resulting from a fire at a timber
   yard, released substantial quantities of tributyltin and lindane (g
   hexachlorocyclohexane) into the River Bourne-a tributary of the River
   Thames. This paper describes the chemical and biological effects
   resulting from the incident. Water-column concentrations in the River
   Bourne South ranged from below detection limits to 5200 mu g/l and 3700
   mu g/l for tributyltin and lindane respectively, with contamination
   extending 80 km into the Thames estuary. The high concentration of
   pollutants caused extensive fish mortality and virtually eradicted the
   invertebrate population in the immediate vicinity of the spill. Although
   sediment monitoring revealed initially high surficial sediment
   concentrations of tributyltin (3300 ng/g) and lindane (490 ng/g),
   loadings declined over a period time, but it is perceived that
   contaminated sediments may pose a longer-term threat to benthic
   communities, particularly in the proximity of the spill site.}},

Abstract = {{Common dolphin, Delphinus delphis (bairdi), were monitored acoustically
   across a survey area of 2747 km(2) during a three month period before,
   during and after an oil industry two dimensional (2D) seismic reflection
   survey. Over 900 h of audio survey data were collected and analysed,
   along with GPS positional data, to reveal trends in presence and
   distribution of animals. The presence of dolphins was determined from
   vocalization events on the survey recordings. Dolphin presence was
   assessed by a system of percentage acoustic contact. This was highest
   before and after the seismic survey, with common dolphins showing a
   clear south-westerly skew within the survey area and a probable
   south-westerly migration of animals between September and December.
   Acoustic contact with dolphins during the seismic survey also showed a
   south-westerly skew within the survey area, although percentages were
   lower. Monitoring during the period of seismic activity was restricted
   to the immediate vicinity (1-2 km) of the seismic vessel, so percentage
   contact most likely reflects the response of dolphins to such immediate
   activity. The overall result suggests an avoidance reaction by common
   dolphins to air gun emissions, although certain observations suggest
   tolerance to these sounds outside a 1 km radius of the guns.}},

Abstract = {{Flower pigmentation patterns were scored in 185 sense Chalcone synthase
   (Chs) transgenotes and 85 antisense Chs transgenotes; upon first
   flowering, 139 (75\%) of sense transgenotes were found to be
   phenotypically altered, as were 70 (82\%) of the antisense transgenotes.
   The observed patterns document the range of phenotypic variations that
   occur, as well as confirm and extend the finding that sense Chs
   constructs produce several types of morphology-based flower pigmentation
   patterns that antisense Chs constructs do not. Long-term monitoring for
   epigenetic variations in one population of 44 sense Chs transgenotes
   showed that 43 (98\%) were capable of producing a cosuppression
   phenotype. The primary determinant of sense-specific patterns of
   cosuppression of Chs was found to be the repetitiveness and organization
   pattern of the transgene, not `position effects' by, or `readthrough'
   from, flanking plant DNA sequences. The degree of cosuppression observed
   in progeny of transgenotes carrying multiple, dispersed copies as
   compared to that observed with a single copy of the transgene suggests
   that sense cosuppression of Chs is subject to a transgene dosage effect.}},

Abstract = {{The Temporally Integrated Monitoring of Ecosystems (TIME) project
   utilizes a hybrid sampling approach to achieve its goal of assessing
   whether emissions controls, mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of
   1990, have had their intended effect on lakes and streams. A randomly
   placed triangular grid is used to select, with known probability, lakes
   and streams for sampling on either an annual basis (in the case of
   acid-sensitive sites) or on a 4-year rotation. Data from these sites
   will be used to detect trends in regional characteristics of the target
   populations. The ability of TIME to detect trends in acid-neutralizing
   capacity (ANC) and SO42- is dependent on the amount of variability
   (year-to-year, site-to-site, within-season, and site-by-year
   interaction) exhibited by the sites. In particular, high levels of
   year-to-year variability lead to very low power to detect trends. One
   method to minimize year-to-year variability is to group together sites
   with similar characteristics. By performing trends tests on seven
   separate subpopulations the TIME design for northeastern U.S. lakes is
   predicted to bs able to detect trends of the expected magnitudes in ANC
   (0.5 mu eq L(-1) yr(-1)) and SO42- (1.2 mu eq L(-1) yr(-1)) with power
   at or above the 0.90 level and alpha = 0.10.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the structure of the Ascophyllum nodosum population at
   Pubnico, southwest Nova Scotia, Canada, at an experimental site
   subjected to mechanical harvest and at two control sites never subjected
   to mechanical harvest were monitored from 1991 to 1994. A bimodal
   population structure measured in terms of plant length was
   characteristic of all these sites before the experiment. The population
   structure of the experimental site became unimodal immediately after
   experimental harvest by machine and remained unimodal for the subsequent
   two years. However, a bimodal population structure began to appear in
   the third year. A bimodal population structure remained evident at the
   control site with bedrock as the substratum but was less evident at the
   other control site where the substratum is made up of boulders and
   cobbles. Movement of loose rocks with rockweeds still attached may have
   contributed to the less distinct modal structure of this control site.
   Other sites with different harvesting histories monitored in the summer
   of 1992 showed some interesting patterns. A unimodal population
   structure was evident in Argyle Sound and Pubnico Point South and at
   Charlesville, which had been harvested one and two years before,
   respectively. A bimodal population structure was more evident at
   Frenchman's Point, which had been harvested three years prior. The rate
   of change from a unimodal to a bimodal population structure may depend
   on the intensity of harvest. Extensive canopy removal in intensively
   harvested areas may be conducive to an influx of recruits and to
   regeneration from the holdfast. Hence, plant length modal structure may
   be a useful measure of the relative state of recovery of a harvested
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The Exxon Valdez oil spill in March 1989 and subsequent cleanup caused
   injury to intertidal Fucus gardneri populations especially in the upper
   intertidal. A survey in 1994 in Prince William Sound, Alaska showed that
   the upper boundary of Fucus populations at oiled sites was still an
   average of 0.4 m lower than the upper boundary at unoiled sites.
   Restoration of severely damaged Fucus populations was started on a
   small-scale at a heavily oiled rocky site in Herring Bay, Prince William
   Sound. Experiments employed mats of biodegradable erosion control fabric
   to act as a substratum for Fucus germlings and to protect germlings from
   heat and desiccation stress. A series of plots was covered with mats
   made from a resilient coconut-fiber fabric in June 1993. Half of the
   mats were inoculated with Fucus zygotes. A series of uncovered control
   plots was also monitored. There was no enhancement of Fucus recruitment
   on the rock surfaces under the mats. Dense populations of Fucus
   developed on the surface of all of the mats by the summer of 1994. The
   natural rock surfaces in the control plots, both inoculated and not,
   were barren of macroscopic algal cover. By September 1994, the juvenile
   thalli on the mats were approximately 2 cm in length. Inoculating the
   mats had an effect only in the upper region of the intertidal. It is
   expected that the thalli will become fertile during the 1995 season.
   These thalli may serve as a source of embryos to enhance the recovery of
   new Fucus populations in this high intertidal area.}},

Abstract = {{Gracilaria changii, recorded from Malaysia and Thailand, is one of the
   more abundant agarophytic seaweeds found in Malaysia. A wild population
   of Gracilaria changii growing in mangroves was monitored for seasonal
   variation in agar content and gel strength as well as spore production.
   Agar yield and gel strength ranged from 22 to 25\% dry weight and 294 to
   563 g cm(-2), respectively, over a 15-month period. Gel strength but not
   yield was positively correlated with amount of rainfall. Cystocarps were
   observed throughout the study, but use of sporetraps showed that spore
   release peaked around July-August and January-February after the two
   monsoon periods.
   Mariculture of Gracilaria changii in shallow ponds in the mangroves, in
   an irrrigation canal and in a shrimp farm pond was conducted. Average
   growth rate of cuttings tied to monofilament lines was 3.3 +/- 1.7\%
   d(-1), 8.4 +/- 1.8\% d(-1) and 3.6 +/- 1.6\% d(-1) respectively.
   Cuttings were lost to siltation, wave action, predation and heavy
   epiphytisation.
   These studies show that Gracilaria changii has potential commercial
   application in the agar industry.}},

Abstract = {{Britain's wintering wader populations were estimated for the period
   1987/88-1991/92 from data provided from three sources: the Wetland Bird
   Survey (WeBS), the Winter Shorebird Count and the Winter Atlas. WeBS is
   the annual monitoring scheme for non-breeding water-fowl populations in
   the United Kingdom. It achieves excellent coverage of the important
   concentrations of waders living within estuaries, but the coverage of
   populations using non-estuarine coasts and inland habitats is
   incomplete. The Winter Shorebird Count, conducted in 1984/85, was a
   comprehensive survey of waders wintering on non-estuarine coasts while
   the Winter Atlas provides distributional data for all bird species in
   Britain and ireland for three winters in the early 1980s and is a source
   of information on inland wader populations. The wader populations on
   non-estuarine coasts were estimated from sites counted in both 1984/85
   and in 1987/88-1991/92 as part of WeBS, enabling calibration of the
   Winter Shorebird Count data. The results suggest that Britain's
   coastline supports approximately 1-65 million waders. Values are
   presented from which site evaluations based on 1\% of the national
   population can be derived. Comparison of the new coastal population
   estimates with the previous estimates (for the period 1981-85) suggests
   that numbers of most species of wintering waders have increased on
   estuaries and non-estuarine coasts during the last decade. These
   population changes are compared with trends in British wintering wader
   populations as shown by application of a model-based method of indexing
   populations. The possible causes of between-year fluctuations in wader
   populations are discussed and the importance of long-term monitoring
   schemes emphasised. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Apalachicola rosemary Conradina glabra Shinners is an endangered woody
   mint, endemic to the northwestern portion of Liberty County, Florida,
   USA. Because the few remaining populations of this species ave on
   private silvicultural lands and subject to disturbance, C. glabra was
   reintroduced within its original range onto The Nature Conservancy's
   Apalachicola Bluffs and Ratlines Preserve. Forty-eight plots of nine
   rooted cuttings were planted in each of three sites at the preserve in
   1991. All above-ground herbaceous and small woody vegetation was clipped
   monthly during the growing season around 24 of the plots at each site in
   1991 and 1992. Removal of competition resulted in significantly taller
   plants with move branches and flowers than in control plots across all
   sites. By the end of the second growing season, however, treatment
   effects diminished Survival of planted cuttings was 94\%, but was
   reduced by the prescribed fire management applied to two of the sites.
   Roughly 25\% of the plants which had 50-100\% tissue scorch in the fires
   resprouted. Seedling establishment was highest in the burned sites, and
   almost entirely limited to clipped plots. Evaluation of the success of
   this translocation effort will require long-term monitoring of these C.
   glabra populations and some reduction of fuel around plants prior to
   prescribed burning. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{We estimated the relative importance of the meningeal worm
   (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) as a limiting factor of Moose (Alces alces)
   populations living in sympatry with White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) in southern Quebec, using a questionnaire. We recorded 84
   cases of moose showing typical signs of infection by the meningeal worm,
   61 during the 1983-1992 period. There was close agreement between deer
   distribution and the location of symptomatic Moose. Signs of infection
   with the meningeal worm appeared equally between sexes in animals order
   than 1 year of age, but symptomatic calves were observed less often than
   expected. We found a significant linear relationship (r(2) = 0.80; d.f.
   = 8) between apparent infection rate (observed cases . 10 000 moose(-1).
   yr(-1)) and estimated deer density. At the scale of hunting zones, we
   found no evidence of refugia in which moose would be protected from the
   parasite. Reported cases of symptomatic moose always represented less
   than 1\% of total moose populations; monitoring of 149 radio-collared
   moose in two areas of southern Quebec for other purposes also suggested
   an apparent annual mortality rate from parelaphostrongylosis of <1\%.
   White-tailed Deer densities are probably not high enough to prevent the
   establishment of Moose populations anywhere in Quebec. This limiting
   factor, however, diminishes the demographic vigour of infected
   populations, and the potential hunting harvest.}},

   Little information is available on the biology and ecology of the
   species and the present status in Quebec is uncertain as recent survey
   data are unavailable. The species is apparently secure in Ontario, but
   populations in southwestern Ontario should be monitored as streams in
   this area are subject to disturbances which could alter water quality as
   the species appears to be particularly sensitive to turbidity and
   siltation. Although only recently added to the fauna of Manitoba, the
   species appears to be native to the province and more widespread and

Abstract = {{We captured, weighed, tagged, and monitored polar bear (Ursus maritimus)
   cubs and yearlings in western Hudson Bay to examine survival rates and
   correlates with survival. Cub survival between spring and autumn
   increased with cub mass and maternal mass, but was not related to
   maternal age or maternal condition. Cub survival between spring and
   autumn varied annually between 39.0 and 100.0\% and averaged 53.2\%.
   Whole-litter loss between spring and autumn was 30.8\%, and only 38.0\%
   of the females did not lose any cubs. Survival of spring twins was
   similar regardless of size, but in triplet litters, survival between
   spring and autumn varied according to cub size. Minimum cub survival
   from one autumn to the next was 34.7\% and was related to Cub mass,
   maternal mass, and maternal condition. Cub survival during autumn was
   estimated at 83.0\%. Survival during the first year of life was no more
   than 44.0\% but we could not estimate an annual survival rate because of
   the sampling regime. Possibly because harvesting was the major mortality
   factor for yearlings (19.4\% of the yearlings were removed from the
   population per year), no factors examined correlated with survival of
   yearlings. We found no sex-related differences in survival of cubs or
   yearlings in any period. Relationships between survival in polar bear
   cubs and their condition suggest that lack of food availability,
   sometimes due to low maternal fat stores for lactation, leads to
   starvation and may be the main cause of mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Salmon populations in many Pacific coast rivers are in serious decline
   and in danger of becoming threatened or endangered. A fish population
   model (SALMOD) that tracks fall chinook salmon has been developed for
   the Trinity River, California. The model considers the principal
   environmental factors influencing movement and mortality of
   young-of-the-year salmon from the time of spawning and egg deposition
   until they leave freshwater rivers as juveniles. Numbers of salmon
   produced by alternative managed flow regimes can be estimated using
   SALMOD. This paper explores the consequences of alternative model
   construction and formulation choices on model behavior, and the impact
   of the number of spawners returning from the ocean on development of a
   robust flow management decision. Results show that SALMOD is responsive
   to the user's choice of spawner nesting behavior (superimposition), but
   relatively insensitive to spatial scale describing fish rearing habitat
   quality. The choice of a suitable managed flow regime is sensitive to
   the number of adult fish returning to spawn and even more so to their
   distribution throughout the study area at time of spawning. It would be
   possible to tailor an adaptive annual flow regime based on monitoring of
   spawner numbers and their distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare regional patterns of indoor
   radon concentration with uranium-bearing rock zones and county
   populations in Texas. Zones yielding radon concentrations that are
   relatively high for Texas include shale and sandstone in northwest
   Texas; red beds in north-central Texas; felsic volcanic rocks in west
   Texas; and sandstone, limestone, and igneous rocks in central Texas.
   Located in northwest Texas, only five of the 202 counties evaluated have
   mean indoor radon concentrations above 4.0 pCi I-1. Two of those
   counties have populations above the state median of 20115. The highest
   county mean concentration is 8.8 pCi I-1. Results of this study suggest
   that (1) regional geology influences indoor radon concentrations in
   Texas, (2) statewide, the radon concentrations are relatively low, (3)
   highly populated counties do not coincide with regions of high indoor
   radon concentration, and (4) regions that may warrant further monitoring
   include northwest Texas and, to a lesser degree, west and central Texas.}},

Abstract = {{Lewisia longipetala (Piper) Clay is a high-altitude endemic found in the
   northern Sierra Nevada. The characteristics of 12 sites with L.
   longipetala, which represent all known populations, were studied to
   define habitat requirements of the species. Meso- and microscale
   characteristics of the habitat were examined, including characteristics
   of the associated. plant community average plant size and plant density
   of L. longipetala were also determined for each population. Similar
   measurements were made on 6 populations of Lewisia pygmaea (A. Gray)
   Robinson, a more common Lewisia. Populations of L. longipetala that had
   larger plants and higher plant density were associated with gently
   sloped, north-facing sites that were near large, persistent snowbanks
   and had low vegetative cover. Plant species associated with populations
   of L. longipetala were similar among the 12 sites and were indicative of
   mesic, rocky alpine sites. These types of plant communities found near
   persistent snowbanks are often termed snow-bed vegetation. In contrast,
   L. pygmaea was found to be less site specific. Lewisia pygmaea was found
   adjacent to or interspersed with L. longipetala at 5 sites, but was
   found in areas associated with a higher percentage of herbaceous cover
   and a wider variety of species. This integration of ecological and.
   community information for L. longipetala populations contributes to the
   interim management and long-term monitoring of this species by providing
   needed information concerning its habitat and environmental specificity.}},

Abstract = {{Selective cytogenetic monitoring of the highest priority groups of
   Chernobyl disaster victims has been carried out since 1987. In
   1992-1993, 125 liquidators (irradiated mainly in 1986) and 42 persons
   recovering from acute radiation sickness of the second and third degrees
   of severity were examined. Cytogenetic effects (an elevated level of
   unstable as well as stable markers of radiation exposure) were found in
   all groups, which showed a positive correlation with the initial degree
   of irradiation severity even 6-7 y after the accident. Comparative
   scoring of conventional staining vs. G-banding in 10 liquidators showed
   the identical rate of unstable aberrations. At the same time, the yield
   of stable aberrations for G-banded slides exceeded the frequency for
   conventional staining. In order to study possible mutagenic activity of
   chronic low levels of irradiation, the cytogenetic monitoring of some
   critical groups of the population (especially children and occupational
   groups-tractor drivers and foresters) living in areas of the Ukraine
   contaminated by radionuclides was carried out. In all the examined
   groups, a significant increase in the frequency of aberrant metaphases,
   chromosome aberrations (both unstable and stable), and chromatid
   aberrations was observed. Data gathered from groups of children reflect
   the intensity of mutagenic impact on the studied populations and
   demonstrate a positive correlation with the duration of exposure.
   Results of cytogenetic examination of adults confirmed the importance of
   considering the contribution of occupational radiation exposure to
   genetic effects of Chernobyl accident factors on the population of
   contaminated areas. Results of our investigations demonstrated the
   possibility of evaluating the mutagenic impact of acute and long-term
   irradiation of different intensities on somatic cells of persons
   undergoing radiation exposure due to the Chernobyl accident and
   confirmed the need to introduce new informative genetic methods
   {[}especially fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)] for reliable
   retrospective cytogenetic dosimetry of radiation exposure in Chernobyl
   accident victims.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of radiation monitoring in the zone influenced by the operation
   of the Mayak Production Association is to provide information for
   activities aimed at environmental preservation in that territory. The
   priority tasks of the radioecological monitoring system are measuring
   all parameters of radiation impact on the environment (which contribute
   up to 95\% of the total population exposure dose), and estimating all
   parameters required to support effective decision-making. The basic
   methods for radioecological monitoring are: unification and
   standardization of field and laboratory techniques for radionuclide
   analysis; measurement of gamma-irradiation dose rate; measurement of
   Cs-137, Sr-90, and plutonium concentrations in soils; measurement of
   radionuclide concentration in surface and ground waters and the
   atmosphere; study of the pathways of horizontal and vertical migration
   of radionuclides in natural media; and establishment of data bases
   including ecological mapping. Based on the information obtained,
   assessment of contamination and forecasts of the future radiation
   situation are prepared using models.}},

   Yang, with special reference to diel and dose responses of males to its
   sex-attractant (Z5-10:OH) in the Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr.
   plantations in Shanxi province of China were carried out from 1992 to
   1993. Trap captures increased with a raise in the Z5-10:OH dose up to
   100 mu g, at all the sites tested. They did not significantly differ for
   the 100 mu g, 500 mu g and 1000 mu g doses in sticky traps (1992) and
   decreased obviously when the dose increased from 100 mu g up to 1000 mu
   g in non-sticky Unitraps (1993). Thus, 100 mu g Z5-10:OH was accordingly
   defined as an optimal (standard) lure for C. sinensis. Seasonal flight
   activity, including flight initiation, duration, termination as well as
   the peak, as monitored by pheromone traps varied with altitudes of the
   sites where the field experiments took place. Trapping test using 100 mu
   g and 1000 mu g Z5-10:OH revealed a daytime attraction response pattern
   occurring from 06:00 h to 20:00-21:00 h with response peaks recorded at
   10:00-12:00 h (minor) and 17:00-20:00 h (major). Additionally, the
   significant effects of Z5-10:Ac, and Z5-12:OH, as attraction-inhibitors
   were a ain clearly confirmed in the field using non-sticky Unitraps.}},

Abstract = {{The mutualistic interaction of figs with their species-specific wasp
   pollinators and the role of figs as `keystone' plant resources in
   tropical communities has received substantial attention from both plant
   and animal ecologists. Despite this focus on the reproductive biology of
   figs, the minute size of the wasps has effectively precluded our ability
   to monitor patterns of wasp dispersal and fig mating relationships in
   natural forest habitats. In this paper we use genetic markers and
   genealogy reconstruction techniques to examine the breeding structure of
   populations of four strangler fig species occurring in central Panama.
   The natural history of figs facilitates the genetic analysis of full-sib
   progeny arrays from which the genotypes of successful pollen donors can
   be reconstructed precisely. Paternity reconstruction in the four study
   species reveals that individual flowering trees may routinely receive
   pollen from numerous donors despite characteristically low densities of
   co-flowering individuals. These data indicate not only that breeding
   populations of these figs are larger than the minimum critical sizes
   predicted to be necessary to support populations of their
   species-specific pollinators, but are more extensive in size and area
   than has been described for any plant species yet examined. Further, the
   fig wasps are shown to be efficient agents of long-distance dispersal,
   routinely moving up to 10 km between flowering trees. In accord with the
   potential for substantial long-distance gene flow and large effective
   population sizes, ten of eleven species of Panamanian figs assayed were
   found to maintain exceptionally high levels of genetic variation within
   their populations. Combined with other reports of occasional
   long-distance dispersal, the results of this study suggest that fig
   wasps may be more effective at colonizing isolated fig populations than
   previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Contrary to frequently expressed opinions, the extrapolation from
   high-dose animal experiments to low-dose chronic human exposure may
   underestimate rather than overestimate the true risk of exposure to
   carcinogens. Benzene, vinyl chloride, and butadiene are examples where
   animal risk extrapolation may significantly underestimate the actual
   risk. Since a variety of different enzymes or metabolic systems are
   involved in bioactivation reactions, which include both phase 1 and
   phase 2 reactions, any concentration dependent alteration in either
   activation or detoxification would have a significant effect on mutation
   and cancer Limited evidence would indicate that proportionately less
   active metabolite is formed at high concentration where phase 2 enzymes
   predominate, while at lower concentrations pathways leading to active
   metabolites are favored. The overall effect would lead to an
   underestimate of risk from high-dose animal experiments when
   extrapolating to low-level, chronic human exposure. Data with three
   potent carcinogens, benzene, vinyl chloride, and butadiene indicate the
   possible error in risk estimation from animal cancer bioassay studies.
   This may be a general pattern with chemicals that require enzymatic
   conversion to active metabolites. The public health significance of this
   underestimation could be considerable and underscore the urgency of
   reexamining our present risk procedures. New procedures, including
   biomarkers of effect such as chromosome painting, DNA repair evaluation
   and somatic cell mutation studies can be applied to monitoring
   individuals exposed to toxic substances. Known animal carcinogens as
   delineated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, where
   there is a distinct possibility of underestimation of risk based on
   animal studies; should be evaluated by multiple biomarker studies in
   exposed populations.}},

Abstract = {{Based on residue concentrations in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), we
   mapped the spatial distribution of fluoride across much of the upper
   Snake River Plain in southeastern Idaho. Our results suggest that
   facilities at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL)
   intermittently release this chemical. These emissions affect localized
   areas on the INEL and probably contribute little fluoride to the
   surrounding region. Phosphate ore processing near Pocatello, ID, is a
   recurrent fluoride source and influences a wide area, possibly even the
   INEL. These results are reviewed with respect to anthropogenic and
   natural sources of fluoride. me also compare bee fluoride concentrations
   to those reported for lichens, vegetation, and soils in southern Idaho.}},

Abstract = {{Growing concern about atmospheric exposure of humans to pesticides has
   led to increased air monitoring in California. Air monitoring data
   typically consist of measurements made downwind from point or area
   sources. The utility of monitoring at fixed stations is limited for
   establishing buffer zones to protect neighboring populations from
   pesticide exposure. A modeling approach designed to use these data would
   provide the flexibility needed to establish buffer zones. The Industrial
   Source Complex Short Term (ISCST) model is a gaussian plume dispersion
   model that predicts air concentrations around point or area sources
   using emission rates (flux) and meteorological conditions as model
   inputs. The flux data, however, are typically not collected in the field
   nor available in the literature. In order to use the field data
   currently available, we developed a procedure using methyl bromide
   (MeBr) concentrations around two area sources and the ISCST model, to
   back-calculate flux. In addition, MeBr flux was measured concurrently by
   cooperators conducting an independent study. Air concentrations,
   together with actual meteorological data, were used as inputs to the
   ISCST model. Flux of MeBr was then back-calculated using a two step
   process: (i) an arbitrary flux value of 100 mu g m(-2) s(-1) was used as
   an initial input value. Resultant air concentrations predicted by the
   model were then regressed on air concentrations measured offsite and
   (ii) the resultant regression coefficient was then used to adjust the
   arbitrary flux to a back-calculated flux. Using another regression
   analysis, back-calculated and measured flux rates were found to be
   significantly correlated, indicating this approach may be suitable for
   indirect estimation of Bur. Implications for the use of this method in
   establishing buffer zones designed to protect human health are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Offspring from seven family groups of Arcto-Norwegian cod (AN) and a
   genetically marked Norwegian coastal cod (NC) broodstock, were mixed at
   metamorphosis and raised in the same rearing unit. The fish were
   transferred subsequently to a net-pen and held under standard farming
   conditions. In December 1992, 466 cod juveniles were measured, weighed,
   and tagged individually. Length and weight changes were monitored until
   the fish matured (January 1994). Genotyping of each individual was
   performed using enzyme electrophoresis to identify the fish to strain.
   Prespawning females were examined for organ weights and stage of
   maturity. There were population specific differences in growth
   performance. NC displayed significantly higher specific growth rate
   (SGR) and daily length increment (DLI) during spring/summer season. The
   AN had significantly lower hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices, and
   were thinner than the NC, indicating differences in body form and energy
   allocation pattern between the two strains. All NC (both sexes) became
   sexually mature at the age of 2 years while 2\% of fish in the AN group
   were still immature at the end of the experiment. (C) 1996 The Fisheries

Abstract = {{Microclimate and other abiotic factors may be important in determining
   the survival of arthropod vectors, yet the impact of such variables
   rarely has received careful examination. The impacts of habitat,
   microclimate, and experimental confinement on survival rates of unfed
   adult blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say, were studied in field
   enclosures in southcentral and northwestern Connecticut At both
   locations, 2 enclosures were placed in each of 3 different habitats
   (field, forest canopy, and forest/field edge). Forty wild-caught adult
   ticks (20 males, 20 females) were placed in each enclosure. At one site,
   another 40 ticks were confined to nylon mesh bags placed inside each
   enclosure. Soil temperature, ground-level air temperature and relative
   humidity were measured within each habitat. The number of ticks
   surviving within each enclosure was monitored 1 or 2 times per week.
   Ticks that were confined in nylon bags had a lower survival rate than
   ticks that were able to move freely within the enclosures. Ticks
   survived longer in edge and forest habitats than in open fields, which
   were characterized by greater extremes in air temperature, soil
   temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit than the
   other 2 habitats. The mean daily survival rates of free-ranging I.
   scapularis were negatively related to air temperature, vapor pressure
   deficit, and the coefficient of variation of relative humidity.}},

Abstract = {{The migrations of humpback whales on the African east coast were
   monitored between 1988 and 1991 at Cape Vidal, South Africa. Shore-based
   surveys of the northward migration were undertaken each winter, and a
   survey of the southward migration was undertaken in 1990, from an
   approximately 60-m-high vantage point on a headland.
   Independent-observer surveys were carried out in both 1990 (22 d) and
   1991 (51 d) to determine the proportion of the population within the
   survey area that were being missed by observers using a single
   mark-release model. Results were stratified into three distance
   intervals from the shore and three sighting condition intervals; there
   were constant sighting probabilities from the south tower under
   different sighting conditions, while those from the north tower
   increased slightly as sighting conditions improved. Sighting
   probabilities from both towers were highest in the intermediate distance
   interval and decreased in both the inshore and offshore regions.}},

Abstract = {{A recovery-monitoring program of the African east coast humpback whale
   population was carried out through shore-based visual surveys from Cape
   Vidal, northern Natal. Surveys of the northward migration were
   undertaken each winter from 1988 to 1991, and a survey of the southward
   migration was undertaken in 1990. Independent observer surveys were
   undertaken during June 1990 and during the entire 1991 survey. Hourly
   densities of groups sighted each day were adjusted for groups missed by
   observers with distance from the shore and under different sighting
   conditions. Densities were multiplied by 24 h and the mean group size of
   the survey year to give resulting daily densities of individuals, which
   were summed to provide totals of whales sighted during each year's
   survey. The best estimate of population size was 1,711 (made during the
   northward migration of 1990), although this is likely to be biased
   downwards by a proportion of the population passing outside of
   observers' view. Bootstrapping of the 1991 daily data resulted in CVs
   between 11.4\% and 12.2\%. The numbers sighted show the population to
   have undergone considerable recovery since protection in October 1963.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of introducing permethrin-impregnated bednets on local
   populations of the malaria vector mosquitoes Anopheles funestus and the
   An.gambiae complex was monitored during a randomized controlled trial at
   Kilifi on the Kenyan coast. Pyrethrum spray collections inside 762
   households were conducted between May 1994 and April 1995 after the
   introduction of bednets in half of the study area. All-night human bait
   collections were performed in two zones (one control and one
   intervention) for two nights each month during the same period. PCR
   identifications of An.gambiae sensu lato showed that proportions of
   sibling species were An. gambiae sensu stricto > An.merus >
   An.arabiensis.
   Indoor-resting densities of An.gambiae s.l. and the proportion of
   engorged females decreased significantly in intervention zones as
   compared to control zones. However, the human blood index and Plasmodium
   falciparum sporozoite rate remained unaffected. Also vector parous rates
   were unaltered by the intervention, implying that survival rates of
   malaria vectors were not affected. The human-biting density of
   An.gambiae s.l., the predominant vector, was consistently higher in the
   intervention zone compared to the control zone, but showed 8\% reduction
   compared to pre-intervention biting rates - versus. 94\% increase in the
   control zone.
   Bioassay, susceptibility and high-performance liquid chromatography
   results all indicated that the permethrin content applied to the nets
   was sufficient to maintain high mortality of susceptible vectors
   throughout the trial. Increased rates of early outdoor-biting, as
   opposed to indoor-biting later during the night, were behavioural or
   vector composition changes associated with this intervention, which
   would require further monitoring during control programmes employing
   insecticide-treated bednets.}},

Abstract = {{Fire suppression and habitat fragmentation during the twentieth century
   have generated many long-unburned stands of relatively isolated sand
   pine scrub. Such stands often lose most of their endemic herbs as woody
   species come to dominate. A sand pine scrub stand last burned in 1926 or
   1927 was prescription burned in February 1986 after a 1985 vegetation
   census and then was resampled five times over a 7-year recovery period.
   In spite of a wide variety of recovery strategies to the low-intensity
   burn, there was little change in the floristic makeup of postburn stands
   compared to the preburn stand. Detrended correspondence analyses
   suggested that floristic composition and community structure of postburn
   stands shifted away from those of the preburn stand. However, this shift
   did not restore the populations of narrowly endemic scrub herbs.
   Instead, the change was toward xeric hammock, characterized by the
   persistence of woody understory species, the unsuccessful restoration of
   sand pine (Pinus clausa) as a canopy dominant, and the near absence of
   most herbs. These results suggest that long-unburned sand pine scrub
   will not return to typical scrub through the reintroduction of a single
   low-intensity, winter burn. This study demonstrates the necessity of
   monitoring the consequences of the reintroduction of fire to
   long-unburned vegetation associations and of recognizing variation in
   vegetative responses to different fire regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Natural resource managers can evaluate the effects of management
   procedures only by examining whether the responses of species and
   communities are consistent with conservation objectives. Monitoring
   provides a measurement of these responses through status and trend
   analysis. We present a three-level, hierarchical approach of increasing
   intensity for monitoring rare plant species and suggest appropriate
   sampling and analysis methods for each level. Level 1 focuses on species
   occurrence by mapping distributions of species and identifying the
   presence/absence or spatial extent of each population. Level 2 involves
   a quantitative assessment of abundance or condition, often in terms of
   density, percent cover, or frequency. Level 2 monitoring allows the
   analysis of population trends and hypothesizing about demographic
   mechanisms. Level 3 involves demographic monitoring of marked
   individuals, thereby permitting quantitative assessment of demographic
   parameters, such as survivorship, growth, and fecundity. These data can
   be used for modeling and population viability analysis. Level 3
   monitoring provides the most thorough and rigorous analysis of
   demographic mechanisms underlying population trends. The three levels
   can be efficiently nested, so that, for example, a few populations of a
   species receive intensive Level 3 monitoring while all populations
   receive a lower intensity of monitoring. Monitoring programs involving
   these three levels are being used on 13 rare plant species at Tiger
   Creek Preserve, Florida, owned by The Nature Conservancy. Intensity
   levels for particular species were chosen based on global and local
   rarity, logistical constraints, and prior data availability. Examples
   are given of results for two species with different life histories.
   Monitoring at three levels for Nolina brittoniana is inconclusive (Level
   1), suggests expanding populations (Level 2), and highlights both the
   need for only minor recruitment to maintain population growth and the
   uncertainty regarding actual recruitment (Level 3). Level 2 monitoring
   for Warea carteri clearly shows that fire promotes aboveground
   population appearance and expansion, although the mechanisms causing
   this population behavior can only be hypothesized based on available
   data.}},

Abstract = {{We report the extinction and colonization rates of five sympatric small
   mammal species at a semi-arid locality in north central Chile. We
   provide information based on 6 years of monitoring on how colonization
   and extinction rates change according to landscape features (slope
   aspect) and on their relationship to populations size, population
   variability, and body size. We found that: (1) for all species in the
   assemblage, extinction rates of subpopulations from equatorial-facing
   slopes were significantly lower than those in polar-facing slopes, (2)
   population size was the most important factor determining extinction
   rates, (3) colonization rates did not vary between slopes, and were
   affected by population size only in equatorial-facing slopes, and (4)
   most species had higher extinction than colonization rates. Persistence
   of the metapopulation system for all five small mammal species appears
   to be fueled by repeated colonization events.}},

Abstract = {{Cyprodinil is a representative of the new class of broad-spectrum
   anilinopyrimidine fungicides. The effect of cyprodinil on mycelial
   growth of Botryotinia fuckeliana on solid agar medium depends on the

   the bioassay. An in-vitro method was developed to study the sensitivity
   distribution to cyprodinil in two wild-type populations of B. fuckeliana
   from fruits of strawberry with grey mould To validate the applicability
   of the method, sensitivities to cyprodinil mepanipyrim and pyrimethanil
   were monitored in populations of B. fuckeliana from grapes with grey
   mould from different vineyards, including one trial vineyard where
   reduced performance of cyprodinil had been encountered. The monitoring
   procedure was based on the inhibition of the mycelial growth on a
   synthetic medium containing L-asparagine (asp-agar) amended with the
   active ingredients. The mycelium was grown on asp-agar discs, starting
   from a spore suspension, for 17 h prior to the beginning of the test.
   This procedure proved to be efficient. The two wild-type populations
   from different sampling sites showed similar distributions of the
   sensitivity to cyprodinil. Some isolates from the trial site with
   reduced performance of anilinopyrimidines showed reduced sensitivities
   to cyprodinil mepanipyrim and pyrimethanil demonstrating
   cross-resistance between these anilinopyrimidines.}},

Abstract = {{Kokanees Oncorhynchus nerka (lacustrine sockeye salmon) and Utah chub
   Gila atraria feed extensively on similar sizes and species of
   zooplankton in Flaming Gorge Reservoir. We measured the effects of Utah
   chub on the growth of kokanees in six 80-m(3) enclosures containing
   ambient zooplankton populations. Three kokanees and 0, 3, 6, 12, or 24
   Utah chub were weighed and placed in each enclosure. After 21 d, fish
   were removed and kokanee growth was compared among treatments.
   Zooplankton biomass, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and temperature
   profiles were monitored during each test. In May 1992, no competitive
   interactions were observed; in June 1992, however, zooplankton biomass
   and kokanee growth declined significantly as Utah chub densities
   increased. The best predictor of kokanee growth was Daphnia pulex
   density, which explained 76\% of the variance in kokanee growth.
   Differences in temperature and initial zooplankton biomass affected the
   strength of observed competition. Our results suggest that monitoring
   forage resources rather than nongame fish densities may provide a better
   framework for assessing competition among pelagic fish species.}},

Abstract = {{We used daily air and water temperatures from 14 lakes in Ontario to
   develop and test a simple method for constructing lake-specific
   empirical models for predicting daily littoral water temperatures. Data
   requirements for prediction are modest (average air temperature, day of
   the year) and the method is robust and practical, requiring only a few
   (15-20) well-spaced water temperature observations to construct a
   single-year model that can generate reasonably accurate predictions for
   an entire ice-free season. The ability of a singe-lake model to predict
   several years of temperature data is significantly improved by
   explicitly including information on ice-out date in the model. Our
   multiyear model for Lake Opeongo described most (18 of 22) years well.
   Years that were not well described were usually coincident with El Nino
   Southern Oscillation events. Used with caution, the method can be an
   effective tool for supplementing direct monitoring of littoral water
   temperatures and for generating historical water temperature estimates
   when direct estimates are lacking. These capabilities should be of
   particular use to fisheries biologists studying or managing populations
   of fish species with critical life stages that are affected by littoral
   water temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between time dependent population dynamics of
   nitrifiers and heterotrophs in undefined mixed-population biofilms and
   their nitrification efficiency was experimentally investigated at
   various C:N ratios of feed solutions. Five types of biofilms were
   cultured in partially submerged rotating biological contactors (RBC's)
   at different C:N ratios and were used as test materials. The results
   indicated that initial microbial composition in the biofilms and
   substrate composition (e.g. C:N ratio) strongly influenced the later
   population dynamics and the nitrification efficiency. Higher influent
   C:N ratio retarded accumulation of nitrifying bacteria, especially
   NO2-oxidizers, resulting in a considerably long start-up period for
   complete and stable nitrification due to competition for dissolved
   oxygen and space in the biofilm. Furthermore, a start-up inoculum was
   very important to keep start-up time of nitrification to a minimum.
   Time-dependent population dynamics in the biofilms reflected well the
   bulk water quality and microbial community structure in the bulk liquid.
   These results suggest that the structure of microbial community in the
   biofilm can be predicted from monitoring the water quality and
   microbiology of the bulk liquid. Physiologically inactive cells in the
   biofilm were determined by an INT dehydrogenease assay. These cells
   gradually accumulated up to about 30\% of the total bacterial population
   within the biofilms. The results of this study will provide a rational
   basis for developing and controlling desired biofilm population dynamics
   to maximize nitrification efficiency of wastewater biofilms Copyright

   garden food production; soil ingestion by humans, livestock, and
   wildlife; human exposure through livestock tissues where the livestock
   were exposed through crop contamination or biosolids/soil ingestion;
   wildlife exposure through soil organisms; release to surface and
   groundwater; volatilization into inhaled air, or dust generated by
   tillage, Two Pathways were found to comprise the greatest risk from
   persistent lipophilic organic compounds such as PCBs: (1) adherence of
   biosolids to forage/pasture crops from surface application of fluid
   biosolids, followed by grazing and ingestion of biosolids by livestock
   used as human food; and (2) direct ingestion of biosolids by children,
   Each Pathway considers risk to Highly Exposed Individuals (HEIs) rather
   than to the general population who seldom have appreciable exposure to
   biosolids or foods grown on biosolid-amended soils. Because present
   (1995) biosolids contain very low levels of PCBs in countries which have
   prohibited manufacture and use of these compounds, the estimated
   increase in lifetime cancer risk to HEIs from biosolids-borne PCBs
   applied to cropland or gardens was much less than 10(-4). Low biosolids
   PCBs and low probability of simultaneously meeting all the constraints
   of the HEI indicate that HEIs have less than 10(-7) increase in lifetime
   cancer risk from biosolids-borne PCBs; this provides even higher
   protection to the general population. We conclude that quantitative risk
   assessment for potentially toxic constituents in biosolids can be
   meaningfully conducted because research has provided transfer
   coefficients from biosolids and biosolid-amended soils to plants and
   animals needed to assess risk for many organic compounds.}},

   Peninsula. The total catch was 869 specimens belonging to 21 species.
   The catches peaked in sites representing the earlier stages of forest
   decline, being about two times as large as in the unpolluted area. The
   noctuid moths were heterogeneous in their response to pollution impact:
   (1) Xestia rhaetica, X. speciosa and Eurois occultus showed a clinal
   decline towards the emission source, (2) Diarsia mendica peaked at
   slightly polluted sites, (3) Acronicta auricoma, Hyppa rectilinea,
   Apamea maillardi and Xestia alpicola were most abundant in moderately
   polluted areas, (4) a mountain tundra species, Polia conspicua, was
   collected in heavily polluted sites only. However, neither species
   richness nor diversity of Noctuidae were affected by pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate fresh waters of eastern North America were invaded in the late
   1980s by two bivalve species, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)
   and the quagga mussel (D. bugensis). The point of origin of zebra
   mussels is unknown because they are widespread throughout western and
   eastern Europe, but the quagga mussel is confined to the Dnieper and Bug
   rivers in the Ukraine. Both species are highly variable in shell
   morphology. Zebra mussel color and pattern morphs defy classification,
   but at least one distinct pattern is found only in the Aral-Caspian
   region and North American populations. An extremely pale, laterally
   compressed quagga morph is found in eastern Lake Erie and southern Lake
   Ontario, but has not been noted in the Ukraine. Allozyme electrophoresis
   has revealed extraordinarily high levels of genetic variability in the
   zebra mussel. Average heterozygosities range from 27.0 to 43.5\%,
   compared to 9.7 to 14.5\% in the quagga mussel. Two surveys of North
   American and European populations indicated that little variability was
   lost when zebra mussels were transported to North America. Therefore,
   either the invader population was comprised of a large number of
   individuals, and/or more than one source population contributed to the
   invasion. No genetic differentiation among populations has occurred in
   North America in the nine years since the first invasion. Zebra mussels,
   like many bivalves, demonstrate heterozygote deficiencies at some loci.
   A weak correlation has been found between individual heterozygosity and
   shell length. The need for identification of enzymes, loci, and allelic
   mobilities to allow comparison of genetic data among studies is
   stressed, as is the need for vouchering specimens. Fruitful areas for
   future research include elucidation of dreissenid taxonomy and status of
   putative subspecies, monitoring for the potential invasion of the saline
   tolerant D. rostriformis grimmi into North American estuarine waters,
   and ecological and physiological comparison of extreme morphs such as
   the normal and profundal quagga mussels.}},

Abstract = {{We have begun a long-term ecological research project to address
   questions about the impact of multiple disturbances on the species
   richness of communities and whether multiple disturbances are additive
   or interactive. A protected water catchment area was chosen, which is
   subjected to fires, sand mining and clearing, and for which detailed
   records are available. The study area, at Tomago (32 degrees 52'S, 151
   degrees 45'E), has forest, woodland, shrubland and swamp on a sand
   substrate, with the vegetated dunes forming part of a coastal embayment.
   Forty-four sites were located in forested areas that had undergone
   disturbance by either fire, sand mining or clearing. Sites of each
   disturbance type were grouped into four age classes: less than 1 year
   since disturbance, nominally 1991; 5 years, nominally 1986; 11 years,
   nominally 1980; and 17 years, nominally 1974. A set of burned sites,
   with the time of the last fire matched to the times of the other
   disturbances, was used as the control response. In this paper we
   describe the study area and sites, then examine the effects of each
   single disturbance on vegetation structure. Canopy cover increased with
   time and type of disturbance, with 17 year old cleared or mined sites
   similar to the cover of 11 year old burned sites. In the first two years
   after disturbance, burned sites had significantly more understorey
   vegetation than cleared or mined sites, but by 5 years all three were
   similar. The data presented here show that regeneration of mined sites
   at Tomago is substantially slower than regeneration following
   disturbance by fire, with the regeneration of cleared sites intermediate
   but, closer to mining than fire. After 17 years regeneration, cleared
   and sand mined sites had not returned to the vegetation structure of the
   pre-disturbance state. Understorey height and the amount of vegetation
   on cleared or mined sites have not achieved the levels in the original
   forest, although canopy cover did seem to have reached pre-disturbance
   levels. Current rehabilitation techniques are more sophisticated than
   those used 17 years ago and continued monitoring of sites currently
   being rehabilitated may show a faster return to pre-disturbance states.
   Having established the hierarchy and nature of the response to each
   single disturbance here, we are now in a position to investigate the
   impact of multiple disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Two European gall-producing insects, Urophora affinis Frfld. (Diptera:
   Tephritidae) and Metzneria paucipunctella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera:
   Gelechiidae) were introduced into Virginia in 1986 for biological
   control of spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.). Adults of U.
   affinis (n = 2625) and M. paucipunctella (n = 450) were released at two
   sites in Montgomery County, Virginia, and their populations were
   monitored yearly by dissecting spotted knapweed flower heads. Beginning
   in 1992, knapweed samples collected at various distances from the
   release sites were checked for dispersal. U. affinis is well established
   and is spreading slowly. The number of larvae per flower head and the
   seed numbers are inversely related as plants with the greatest number of
   larvae per spotted knapweed head had the lowest number of seeds.
   Knapweed density has declined at one of the release sites which had the
   highest rate of infestation by U. affinis. Establishment of the moth,
   ICI. paucipunctella, is less certain as it has been recovered at a very
   low level from only one site. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Ormia depleta (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tachinidae), native to Brazil, is a
   parasitoid of some Scapteriscus species (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae). It
   was first cultured in a laboratory in Florida in 1987. Releases of O.
   depleta were made against Scapteriscus mole crickets in all regions of
   Florida beginning in 1988. Establishment of populations was achieved at
   some, but not all, of the release sites. The two earliest-established
   populations were monitored using traps employing synthetic calling song
   of male Scapteriscus mole crickets, to which gravid female flies are
   attracted. Additionally, progeny of the released flies were trapped
   between 1988 and 1993 in 32 peninsular counties, including 15 counties
   in which no releases had been made. The most parsimonious explanation of
   the pathways of spread of the current population was inferred from
   trapping surveys, and this yielded the probable year of colonization for
   peninsular counties. Reports in successive years by golf course
   superintendents of damage by mole crickets showed that counties with O.
   depleta populations had significantly less damage than did
   yet-uncolonized counties. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Growth and development of the foliose macrolichen Xanthoria parietina
   and adjacent lichen and bryophyte spp. was photographically monitored
   over a period of five years. This association developed on a plane
   quadrangle on the top surface of a sandstone block in the botanical
   garden of the University of Zurich. Line tracings of the thalline
   outlines were used for a quantitative estimation of laminal growth by
   means of gravimetric morphometry. Average radial growth of approximately
   6 mm yr(-1) was recorded, with maxima around 7 mm yr(-1). The oldest,
   apothecia-covered central parts of the thalli lost contact with the
   substratum and broke off along stress cracks but the blank substratum
   was rapidly re-colonized by new thallus lobes which regenerated along
   the wound margins, to our present knowledge a peculiarity of X.
   parietina and few related species among the Teloschistales.
   Approximately 50\% of the surface area of the experimental plot was
   covered by X. parietina at the beginning and again at the end of this
   five years period, with significant fluctuations in the time between.
   New growth in the range of 87\% of the total surface area almost
   compensated the losses of approximately 90\% per surface area in five
   years. New growth and losses within these five years accounted for more
   than 170\% of the initial coverage. X. parietina gains a significant
   ecological advantage from its very remarkable regenerative capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of Glossina austeni Newstead populations in the forested
   areas of Unguja island of Zanzibar has since November 1990 routinely
   been carried out with the sticky panel trap because commonly used tsetse
   traps (Biconical, Epsilon, F3) have proved to be unsuccessful in
   catching G. austeni. Initial studies on the catching ability of various
   types of sticky panels for G. austeni indicated that the monopanel was
   as efficient in catching flies as the 3-dimensional version and the
   smaller legpanel. No significant differences in catch rate and sex ratio
   were observed with monopanels in various colours and colour
   combinations. Legpanels coloured white on one panel side and blue on the
   other side caught significantly more flies compared with other colour
   combinations, but female flies were under-sampled (32\%). The type of
   sticky material applied on the panel influenced significantly the catch
   rate and female ratio. During long-term trapping with baby blue and
   white monopanels, females were under-sampled (38-46\%) except when
   poly-isobutyleneLMW was used as sticky material. Analysis of the age
   composition of the sampled G. austeni females revealed that tenerals and
   nulliparous were well represented (11-24\%). More than 20\% of the
   trapped females were older flies, i.e. females with four or more
   ovulations, lour this percentage dropped to 10\% when Tanglefoot was
   used as sticky material.}},

Abstract = {{Most bird species have low survival rates in their first year of life,
   and the highest losses occur when juveniles become independent and
   disperse. Young great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), monitored by
   telemetry in the southwestern Yukon, Canada, survived well during the
   peak of the population cycle of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).
   Subsequently, juvenile survival collapsed parallel to the decline in
   hare densities. The proportion of starving owls did not increase, but
   there was a significant increase in mortalities involving parasitism and
   predation, probably as an interaction with food shortage. The mortality
   rates of juvenile great horned owls peaked before, not during,
   dispersal. We propose that extended parental care makes the postfledging
   stage safe during optimal conditions, but that the relatively slow
   development during this stage incurs the cost of increased
   susceptibility to disease and other mortality factors under
   environmental stress.}},

Abstract = {{A reliable method for monitoring the composting process evolution and
   assessing compost stability is a key factor for successful composting.
   Respirometric methods are commonly used, but they usually measure the
   activity at one specific temperature. In this study the objective was to
   determine simultaneously the respiration activity, in terms of oxygen
   uptake rate, at a number of different temperatures. The `'thermogradient
   respirometer'' developed consists of a solid aluminum cylinder (1.5 m
   long, 155 mm diameter), in which a controlled and stable temperature
   gradient was achieved by attaching an electrically heated plate to one
   end and a cooling system to the other.
   The respiration rate of samples obtained from a 0.6 m(3) pilot scale
   bioreactor, where olive mill wastewater was cocomposted with extracted
   olive press-cake, was determined at eight different temperatures, from
   20 to 66 degrees C. The thermogradient respirometer revealed more
   information about the history and the origin of the samples than
   respirometry at one temperature, and proved to be a very sensitive
   instrument for process monitoring, as it could identify shifts of
   microbial populations in the composting mass.}},

Abstract = {{Experiences with the reintroduction of the takhi, or Przewalski horse
   (Equus ferus przewalskii), in Mongolia can serve as valuable lessons for
   reintroduction of ungulates in general. We discuss the present
   taxonomic, historical, and biological evidence and conclude that takhi
   should be viewed as a typical steppe herbivore. Its last refuge, the
   Dzungarian Gobi, should therefore be seen as a marginal habitat because
   it consists mainly of desert and semidesert. Since 1992 two
   reintroduction projects have been in the acclimatization phase in
   Mongolia. Despite promising developments, problems with cooperation,
   management, habitat choice, insufficient knowledge of the ethology of
   the species, and current land use within the different project areas
   could jeopardize the successful reintroduction of takhi. We review the
   conditions required for a potentially successful ungulate
   reintroduction. The planning of a reintroduction within the framework of
   safe-guarding an entire ecosystem with an integrated management plan
   appears essential. Each potential reintroduction site should be assessed
   thoroughly for its suitability, including size, habitat types, current
   land use, socioeconomics, legislation, and potential problems. Each site
   should be provided with one or more acclimatization facilities to harbor
   genetically and physically healthy, socially adapted animals in
   biologically should groups. An organization structure should be
   established for each reintroduction site. Its objective should be to
   develop an effective management plan and to carefully monitor the
   population and its surrounding ecosystem. Special attention should be
   given to local socioeconomic situations, community participation, and
   training of staff for management, research, and ranger and warden
   activities.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{822-831}},

Abstract = {{With the computer program VORTEX I ran a series of simulations of the
   bearded Vulture (Gypaetus Barbatus) population held in captivity in
   European zoos and of the population released in the Alps. The
   simulations showed that the risk of extinction of the captive population
   with the extraction rates currently in use is low. It seems possible to
   maintain the current release rate of two fledglings per year at each of
   the four release sites in the Alps, but it does not seem possible to
   increase the release rate by expanding the project to other European
   mountains without dangerously depleting the captive population. The
   models showed that the most effective way to increase the release rate
   without increasing the captive population size is by improving hatching
   success in captivity. The information on the demographic parameters of
   the Bearded Vulture population released in the Alps was not good enough
   to predict the ultimate fate of the present population or to allow for
   recommendations on how long the population should continue to be
   supplemented. Although it will be necessary to wait some years to see if
   Bearded Vultures are able to breed in the wild in the Alps and to
   estimate fecundity rates, it should be possible to improve the
   monitoring of the individuals released to obtain more-precise survival
   estimates. The models of the captive and released population also showed
   that it should at least be possible to have an artificially supplemented
   Bearded Vulture population in the Alps, but because this is not the goal
   of the present reintroduction project, the organizations involved should
   decide whether this a politically or economically desirable goal.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{832-839}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring temporal changes in genetic variation has been suggested as a
   means of determining if a population has experienced a demographic
   bottleneck. Simulations have shown that the variance in allele
   frequencies over time (F) can provide reasonable estimated of effective
   population size(N-e). This relationship between F and N-c suggests that
   changes in allele frequencies may provide a way to determine the
   severity of recent demographic bottlenecks experienced by a population.
   We examined allozyme variation in experimental populations of the
   eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to evaluate the relationship
   between the severity of demographic bottlenecks and temporal variation
   in allele frequencies. Estimates of F from both the fish populations and
   computer simulations were compared to expected rates of drift. We found
   that different methods for estimating F had little effect on the
   analysis. The variance in estimates of F was large among both
   experimental and simulated populations experiencing similar demographic
   bottlenecks, but there was no relationship between observed and expected
   values of F. Furthermore, genetic drift was likely to be underestimated
   in populations experiencing the most severe bottlenecks. The weak
   relationship between F and bottleneck severity is probably due to both
   sampling error associated with the number of polymorphic loci examined
   and the loss of alleles during the bottlenecks. For populations that may
   have experienced severe bottlenecks, caution should be used in making
   evolutionary interpretations or management recommendations based on
   temporal changes in allele frequencies.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of landscape patterns is now considered essential
   information in developing programs for biological conservation. We
   examined the adequacy of conventional approaches to landscape-pattern
   characterization by evaluating the spatial patterns in environmental
   conditions and their ecological implications at the landscape level. Six
   factors were varied in a hypothetical, managed, old-growth Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii {[}Mirb.] Franko) landscape of 3000 ha in the
   Pacific Northwest: two variables were associated with biotic processes
   and four with abiotic processes. The two biotic variables represented
   the distribution of habitat for edge and interior forest species. The
   abiotic variables included air temperature at dawn and noon, wind speed,
   and direct solar radiation. The area of edge influence between forest
   patches and the clearcut matrix was simulated as a unique landscape
   element in the spatial analysis. The structurally defined landscape
   pattern (based on vegetation or soil type) differed clearly from the
   patterns associated with the six variables, which also differed among
   themselves. Spatial patterns changed at various temporal scales,
   substantiating the notion that landscape patterns of abiotic variables
   are very dynamic. Area of edge influence played an important role in
   configuring spatial patterns of a landscape, occupied much area in the
   landscape, and significantly influenced ecosystem structure and
   function. Simulation results showed that landscape patterns based solely
   on traditional structural parameters are limited in their usefulness
   because the ecological landscape is the integration of all variables and
   the associated movement of energy, materials, and species. This
   information about landscape patterns delincated by various biotic and
   abiotic variables is critical in reserve design and monitoring and in
   managing habitats for target species across landscapes. Efforts to
   describe the ecological function of an area will have to consider not
   only structurally-defined patches but also patterns in abiotic variables
   that are typically not congruent with structural patches and showing
   daily and seasonal change.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of habitat destruction and fragmentation on survival rate
   and population size were tested in an experimental model system
   consisting of seven enclosed populations of root voles, Microtus
   oeconomus. The study comprised two consecutive parts. First, the effect
   of habitat fragmentation was investigated by comparing survival in three
   populations inhabiting continuous habitat with that in four populations
   inhabiting fragmented habitat. Second, the continuous habitats were
   experimentally fragmented by destroying 50\% of the area inhabited by
   the populations, producing the same configuration as in the fragmented
   habitats. These extensive habitat manipulations were expected to affect
   survival rates due to changes in the spatiosocial structuring of the
   populations. Throughout the study, populations were monitored by an
   intensive live-trapping program. Cormack-Jolly-Seber methodology was
   used for statistical modelling and estimation of survival rates.
   The seven experimental populations differed considerably in population
   dynamics: some grew, while others remained remarkably stable throughout
   the experiment. In contrast to expectations, neither population size nor
   survival rates seemed to be affected by the experimental treatments.
   Survival rate seemed to play a minor role in determining population
   size. Emigration rates, which also seemed to have little direct
   demographic importance, were considerably higher in fragmented than in
   continuous habitats during the first (pre-destruction) part of the
   study. Surprisingly, this difference persisted after habitat
   destruction, when all populations experienced the same habitat
   configuration.
   We conclude that survival rates in these root vole populations were not
   dependent on major alterations of spatiosocial structure, possibly owing
   to adaptation to natural disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding of Roseate Terns Sterna dougallii on the northern Great Barrier
   Reef (11 degrees-15 degrees S) was monitored between 1976 and 1994, and
   they were recorded breeding on the inshore rocky islands in most years,
   usually starting April-May. Between 50-5000 pairs were recorded breeding
   each year and indicate that the northern Great Barrier Reef is an
   important breeding area for Roseate Terns during peak years when large
   colonies of 1000-5000 pairs formed on low sand cays in the far northern
   Great Barrier Reef (11 degrees S). On at least three occasions, breeding
   success was poor in these large colonies, with high mortality of the
   almost-fledged chicks. Growth in weight and wing length of Roseate Tern
   chicks was measured at Eagle Island (14 degrees 42'S) between 1983 and
   1986 in order to assess the influence of food on growth rates and
   survival. Chicks took up to 35 days to fledge, significantly longer than
   the ecologically similar, more numerous Black-naped Tern Sterna
   sumatrana at the same site at the same time and also almost 10 days
   longer than Roseate Tern chicks from temperate North American colonies.
   These data suggest that conditions in northern Australia are rarely
   favourable for the rapid growth and breeding success of Roseate Terns.
   Pelagic fish populations around inshore islands in tropical Australia
   may only be able to support limited numbers of Roseate Terns during the
   breeding season. This makes northeastern Australian populations of this
   globally threatened species extremely vulnerable to changes in the
   availability of their prey during the breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{Three mannose-binding lectins were assayed in artificial diets for their
   toxic and growth-inhibitory effects on nymphal development of the
   peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae. The snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis)
   lectin GNA was the most toxic, with an induced nymphal mortality of 42\%
   at 1500 mu g ml(-1) (30 mu M) and an IC50 (50\% growth inhibition) of
   630 mu g ml(-1) (13 mu M). The daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus)
   lectin NPA and a garlic (Allium sativum) lectin ASA induced no
   significant mortality in the range 10-1500 mu g ml(-1), but did result
   in growth inhibition of 59\% (NPA) and 26\% (ASA) at 1500 mu g ml(-1)
   (40 mu M for NPA, 63 mu M for ASA). All three lectins were responsible
   for a slight but significant growth stimulation when ingested at 10 mu g
   ml(-1), reaching + 26\%, + 18\% and + 11\% over the control values for
   the garlic lectin, the daffodil lectin and the snowdrop lectin,
   respectively. GNA, as well as the glucose/mannose binding lectin
   Concanavalin A, were also provided at sublethal doses throughout the
   life cycle of the aphids, and effects on adult performance were
   monitored. Adult survival was not significantly altered, but both
   lectins adversely affected total fecundity and the dynamics of
   reproduction, resulting in significant reduction in calculated r(m's)
   (population intrinsic rate of natural increase) on lectin-containing
   diets. These effects are discussed in relation to the use of transgenic
   plants expressing these toxic lectins for potential control of aphid
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Multifunnel traps baited with frontalin and turpentine have been used to
   investigate dispersal of southern pine beetles, Dendroctonus frontalis
   Zimmermann, and are routinely used in the southern United States to
   monitor population trends of this serious forest pest. However, there is
   no quantitative data on the effective sampling area of these traps that
   would allow us to convert numbers of beetles caught in a trap to their
   absolute population density (numbers per hectare). We conducted field
   studies to determine the effective sampling area of the multifunnel
   trap. Using field releases of marked beetles, we estimated how the
   probability of capture declines with distance between the trap and the
   release point. The estimated relationship between the capture
   probability and distance is then translated into the effective sampling
   area. The effective sampling area for the multifunnel trap was estimated
   as approximate to 0.1 ha. Our results also indicate that the capture
   efficiency of a trap declines with increased density of host trees
   around the trap. We discuss our findings in the context of previous
   studies that measured attraction to pheromone traps in other species of
   bark beetles and in the gypsy moth.}},

Abstract = {{Cities have a negative impact on the quality of shallow groundwater.
   Many of Lithuania's urban residents drink water from dug wells.
   Moreover, polluted shallow groundwater contaminates deeper aquifers of
   fresh drinking water. Therefore, this situation should be controlled and
   managed, as far as possible. In order to evaluate the quality of shallow
   groundwater in an urban area and to create an optimal monitoring system,
   an original methodology for groundwater mapping has been proposed. It
   resembles the GIS (geographical information system) technologies. The
   set of maps, laid one over another, consists of the following: (1)
   urbanization map, (2) geological-hydrogeological map, (3) groundwater
   chemistry map, (4) resulting groundwater chemistry factorial analysis
   map, and (5) pollution and pollutant transport map. The data obtained
   from studies on dug and geotechnical wells have been used for
   compilation of the maps. The system for shallow groundwater monitoring
   in the city with an area of 70 sq km and a population of 140,000 is
   proposed to consist of about 30 monitoring wells and several dug wells.}},

Abstract = {{Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, were collected monthly from a
   copper-contaminated reservoir over a period of nearly 3 years. Copper
   concentrations in the organisms showed marked fluctuations reflecting
   changes in the water contamination. Bioconcentration patterns were
   influenced by the specific capacity of this sentinel organism to
   biologically integrate the continuously evolving water pollution; the
   sampling pattern, which inevitably introduced a certain subjectivity
   into monitoring results; and weight changes in the animals within the
   yearly cycle. Consequently, the successive monthly indications obtained
   with the zebra mussels provided a current biological assessment of a
   complex dynamic contamination situation. In a second experiment, caged
   mussels from three different populations were transferred for 3 months
   into the reservoir and sampled on six occasions. Mortality rates,
   attachment capacity, and a condition index revealed no substantial
   fitness disturbances in the transplanted organisms. Differences in dry
   weight throughout the experiment were attributable to the initial
   characteristics of each population. The influence of body mass on
   monitoring results was eliminated by replacing copper concentrations (mu
   g/g dry weight) with copper burdens (mu g/specimen). In terms of copper
   burdens, the three transplanted populations exhibited very similar metal
   patterns. Moderate quantitative differences between introduced and
   indigenous populations were interpreted as the result of physiological
   adaptation of the indigenous mussels to their contaminated environment.
   This study showed that the transfer technique with D. polymorpha is a
   useful tool for active biomonitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{A 16.7-ha wetland with a pond at the Experimental Lakes Area,
   northwestern Ontario, was experimentally hooded to causes of elevated
   waterborne methyl mercury (MeHg) associated with impoundment. Unionid
   mussels, Pyganodon grandis (formerly Anodonata grandis grandis) were
   caged in the experimental pond before and after flooding to determine
   their ability to monitor the elevated waterborne MeHg. Mussels were also
   caged in a reference wetland pond and in the lake from which they were
   collected (source lake). Background levels of MeHg in source lake mussel
   body parts were in the order mantle < gill or visceral remains < foot or
   kidney and ranged from 108 to 618 ng/g dry weight. Caging in the source
   lake did not alter MeHg concentration in any body part. Mussels
   transplanted to the ponds for 90 d showed statistically significant
   increases above background MeHg in the mantle and visceral remains in
   the preflood experimental pond (waterborne MeHg 0.09 ng/L) and in the
   mantle, visceral remains, foot, and kidney in the reference pond
   (waterborne MeHg 0.24 ng/L). The visceral remains of mussels in the
   reference pond contained higher levels of MeHg than did those in the
   preflood experimental pond. Flooding increased waterborne MeHg from 0.1
   to 2.3 ng/L and resulted in an increase in MeHg and total Hg (THg) in
   the mantle, foot, and visceral remains of mussels in the experimental
   pond. Inexplicably, mussels caged in a hypoxic environment in the
   experimental pond lost MeHg and THg from all body parts. We concluded
   that not only can P. grandis monitor elevation in waterborne MeHg with
   flooding, but the MeHg levels in mussels also reflect small differences
   in background levels of natural MeHg in ponds.}},

Abstract = {{A synthetic food-based attractant, and a painted cylindrical dry trap
   that protects the synthetic lures from the environment, were developed
   to replace liquid protein-baited traps. This trapping system was tested
   for capture of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata
   (Wiedemann). The dry trap is constructed of acetate Blm with a painted
   band that provides a visual cue; it contains internally-placed toxicant
   panels to kill flies that enter the trap. Field trials conducted in
   Guatemala suggested that a solid-colored material could be substituted
   for the painted trap body. Sire also evaluated a sticky insert made from
   commercially produced adhesive paper as a replacement for the toxicant
   panels. Unlike paintable sticky adhesives, tile sticky material on the
   adhesive paper insert does not adhere to the skin of personnel who
   service the traps. An open-bottom trap made of green opaque plastic with
   a sticky insert captured more C. capitata than the closed-bottom painted
   trap with a toxicant panel. When used in conjunction with sterile insect
   release technology, the open-bottom dry trap baited with food-based
   synthetic attractant often caught wild C. capitata in numbers equal to
   those caught by trimedlure-baited Jackson traps, but the dry trap caught
   many fewer sterile C. capitata.}},

Abstract = {{Palm weevils in the subfamily Rhynchophorinae (Curculionidae)
   (Rhynchophorus spp., Dynamis borassi, Metamasius hemipterus,
   Rhabdoscelus obscurus, and Paramasius distortus) use male-produced
   aggregation pheromones for intraspecific chemical communication.
   Pheromones comprise 8, 9, or 10 carbon, methyl-branched, secondary
   alcohols. (4S,5S)-4-Methyl-5-nonanol (ferrugineol) is the major
   aggregation pheromone for R. ferrugineus, R. vulneratus, R, bilineatus,
   M. hemipterus, and D. borassi and a minor component for R. palmarum.
   (5S,4S)-5-Methyl-4-octanol (cruentol), (3S,4S)-3-methyl-4-octanol
   (phoenicol), and (4S,2E)-6-methyl-2-hepten-4-ol (rhynchophorol) are the
   main aggregation pheromones for R. cruentatus, R. phoenicis, and R.
   palmarum, respectively. Plant kairomones strongly enhance pheromone
   attractiveness but none of the identified volatiles, such as ethyl
   acetate, ethyl propionate, or ethyl butyrate are as synergistic as
   fermenting plant (palm or sugarcane) tissue. Studying orientation
   behavior of foraging weevils to semiochemical devices helped to design
   and test traps for weevil capture. Generally, 3 mg per day of synthetic
   pheromone (with non-natural stereoisomers being benign) plus
   insecticide-treated plant tissue constitute highly attractive trap
   baits. Potential exists for pheromone-based mass-trapping of weevils to
   reduce their populations and the spread of the weevil-vectored red ring
   disease, for monitoring their population dynamics to facilitate pest
   management decisions, and for detection and possible interception of
   non-native weevils at ports of entry.}},

Abstract = {{Adult behaviour and egg development of Agriotes ustulatus Schaller were
   studied under field as well as laboratory conditions in north-eastern
   Italy over a 5-year period. Adults proved to be active in daylight only,
   particularly in the morning. The flight of A. ustulatus could be well
   monitored both by sticky traps and sweep net used on Umbelliferae
   flowers. Light yellow and white sticky traps proved to be significantly
   more attractive than red and green ones, while black ones showed no
   effectiveness at all. Sticky trap efficiency was highest when the trap
   level was lowest and it was not affected by orientation. Adult swarming
   occurred during a period from late June to early September; most of the
   specimens (from 68 to 98\% of the total amount) were captured in July
   when the capture peaks were recorded (more frequently in the second half
   of the month, just after mid-month). The capture level was high only
   when last instar larvae populations were over 10 larvae/m(2). Sex ratio
   was about 1.1. Oviposition started 5-7 days after adults had darkened
   and was completed within 2-4 days. Eggs (0.61 x 0.46 mm) were laid in
   clusters in the upper layers of the soil. The average number of eggs
   laid by single females was 75 (SD = 27.9). Embryonic development took 45
   days at 15 degrees C, 14.1 at 25 degrees C and 12.6 at 29 degrees C. The
   hatching percentage ranged between 95 and 100\% of the oviposited eggs.}},

Abstract = {{The spruce web-spinning sawflies of the genus Cephalcia have been
   surveyed on two host plants (Picea Koraiensis and P. jezoensis) in both
   natural and artificial stands of north-eastern China. Ornamental trees
   were also included in the study. Five sites situated in the Provinces of
   Heilongjiang and Jilin and characterized by various elevations were
   considered in 1992-93. A total of nine species have been found, in the
   following decreasing order of abundance: C. abietis, C. arvensis (with
   two froms), C. fallenii, C. pallidula (new to China), C. alashanica, C.
   erythrogaster, C. fulva, C. klugii, and an unknown species. In most
   cases the adult specimens from China show a darker and more extended
   pigmentation with respect to the European ones. Some biological
   attributes (emergence period of adults, oviposition features, larval
   instars and feeding habits) are given for each species and compared with
   those known from European populations. A key for the practical
   identification of prepupae is presented. All information could be useful
   in monitoring, since these sawflies are considered among the main pests
   of various spruce species in this region.}},

Title = {{Fitness components of grazing-induced population reduction in a dominant

Abstract = {{1 Intensive cattle grazing reduces population density of the dominant
   annual Triticum dicoccoides (wild wheat) in Mediterranean grasslands in
   northern Israel. An experiment was designed to quantify the impact of
   grazing on various components of plant fitness in the growing season
   that may contribute to this reduction. Height, tiller number, survival
   and reproduction of marked plants were monitored throughout two growing
   seasons in paired grazed and protected plots and in recently defoliated
   and undefoliated plants in grazed plots.
   2 Plant survival in the vegetative stage was similarly high in grazed
   and protected plots in 1990-91, but in 1991-92 it was 14\% higher in
   protected plots. Plants in protected plots were 60-172\% taller than
   those in grazed plots, but plants in grazed plots had 44-107\% more live
   tillers at the end of the vegetative stage. Tiller initiation was
   enhanced in undefoliated as well as defoliated plants within grazed
   plots, suggesting that the increase may have been a response to the
   modified radiation environment in the grazed community.
   3 The proportion of plants that produced mature inflorescences was
   51-59\% greater in protected than in grazed plots, and within grazed
   plots it was much lower among plants that had been grazed in the last
   month of the season. The number of mature inflorescences per fertile
   plant was not consistently different between treatments, but the number
   of immature inflorescences was greater in grazed plots. Apparently,
   following removal of inflorescences late in the growing season,
   insufficient resources remained for maturation of secondary
   inflorescences. Spikelet number per inflorescence was 21-42\% greater in
   protected than in grazed plots, which may reflect effects of grazing in
   the vegetative stage on inflorescence development. Seed number and
   weight per spikelet were not significantly affected by grazing.
   4 The number of mature spikelets or seeds produced per seedling (an
   estimate of fitness throughout the growing season) was reduced by about
   50\% in grazed compared to protected plots in both years. The largest
   consistent components of reduction were due to removal of maturing
   inflorescences in the late reproductive stage.
   5 Deferment of grazing during the reproductive stage may be sufficient
   to maintain abundant populations of wild wheat, while grazing during the
   remainder of the year will limit their suppressive effects on other
   annual species.}},

Abstract = {{Responses to insecticides in bollworm, Helicoverpa tea (Boddie), males
   collected from 1988 to 1994 in sex-pheromone baited traps in the Brazos
   Valley near College Station, TX, varied during each season with
   tolerance being highest in midseason. Significant tolerance occurred
   with cypermethrin in 1988 and 1989, and with endosulfan in 1994. Tests
   in 1994 with profenofos or methomyl showed no significant tolerance to
   these insecticides. We found significant variations between trap sites
   in responses of field bollworms to cypermethrin, suggesting that
   increased tolerance may be a localized phenomenon. Tests with
   cypermethrin plus piperonyl butoxide indicated significant synergism in
   bollworms collected from the field, suggesting that enhanced metabolic
   degradation may be a factor in pyrethroid tolerance in this species.
   Diagnostic concentrations for monitoring tolerance in field-collected
   bollworm males were determined for all insecticides tested, The results
   reported here validate use of the adult vial test to monitor for
   tolerance to insecticides in the bollworm, and provide information
   useful for the development of a resistance management strategy intended
   to extend the efficacy of insecticides used to control the bollworm.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Koch), from
   nurseries in California, Florida, the Canary Islands, and Holland that
   have been treated with abamectin for the control of Lyriomiza spp. and
   twospotted spider mites were evaluated for their susceptibility to
   abamectin using a leaf residual bioassay. Mite populations sampled
   during 1990-1992 varied greatly in their susceptibility to abamectin,
   with resistance ratios at the LC(95) ranging from 0.5 to 175 in a 1-d
   leaf residual assay. Resistance was correlated with the numbers of
   applications per year and years of use of abamectin. Based on
   correlation analyses, there may be differences in the development of
   resistance to abamectin in mites from California and mites from Holland.
   The data on number of applications per year show that resistance was not
   detected in California nurseries that had used the product <6 times per
   year or for 4 yr, whereas in Holland, resistance was detected in
   nurseries that had used the product 3 times per year or for 2 yr.
   Although functional resistance was detected in this laboratory bioassay,
   no field failures were observed. Characterization of abamectin
   resistance using residual and contact assays and by the use of the
   synergists piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and S,S,S,-tributyl
   phosphorotrithioate (DEF), indicated that differences may exist in the
   mechanisms used by different T. urticae populations to develop
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Seagrass meadows are one of the most vulnerable habitats of coastal or
   estuarine waters in Australia. Their continued existence near centres of
   human population is in peril, but all levels of government are now under
   pressure to protect these valuable habitats. The first step is to
   measure the health and abundance of the seagrasses. To help managers to
   do this, I describe some of the methods used successfully in Australia
   and overseas. Aerial surveys and remote sensing are discussed as the
   method for gross scale inventory gathering. Permanent transects can
   detect changes at a much smaller scale. Biomass, density and
   productivity measurements all indicate the `'health'' of seagrass
   meadows. These methods are described with emphasis on the need for
   statistical rigour and regard for temporal and spatial variability. If
   managers and researchers use the same or similar methods throughout the
   coastal and estuarine seagrass habitats, they can compare results and
   use baseline studies and findings from other areas, where relevant. (C)

   captive male Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) and used
   sonagraphic analysis to assess individuality in voice. All males were
   recorded several times on at least three different nights. The mean
   frequency of the sustained component of an individual's calls was highly
   distinctive only two owls shared a similar mean call frequency.
   Internote interval and note length were not as individually distinctive;
   although these features varied significantly among males, there was as
   much or more variation among nights for the same male. I suggest that
   male Saw-whet Owls can be accurately identified using sonagraphic

Abstract = {{Regional assessment of nematode communities to monitor the condition or
   ecological health of agricultural soils requires sampling programs with
   measures of known reliability and the ability to detect differences over
   time. Numbers of fields sampled in a region, samples taken per field,
   and subsamples assayed per sample must be balanced with cost to provide
   the best sampling scheme. We used components of variance from statewide
   surveys in North Carolina (1992) and Nebraska (1993) to estimate number
   of (i) fields to be sampled; (ii) 20-core, composite soil samples to be
   obtained for each field; and (iii) subsamples to be assayed for each
   composite sample to detect a specified amount of change in index values
   within a geographic region. Variances for these three components were
   used to estimate the degree of reliability for five ecologically based
   indices (four measures of maturity and one of diversity) of nematode
   communities. Total variance for maturity and diversity indices, based
   upon communities of free-living nematodes, was greater in North Carolina
   than in Nebraska; the opposite was true for indices based strictly upon
   maturity of communities of plant-parasitic nematodes or of all nematodes
   in soil. Variability within samples was greater in North Carolina than
   in Nebraska, especially for maturity indices based only upon free-living
   nematodes. We identified two possible sampling strategies for a regional
   survey: Option 1, with two independent samples per field and a single
   subsample assayed per sample, which would provide a reliability ratio
   value greater than or equal to 0.6 for most indices; and Option 2, with
   three independent samples per field and two subsamples assayed per
   sample, which would provide a reliability ratio value greater than or
   equal to 0.7 for several indices. When cost was considered, Option 1 was
   the better strategy. Number of fields to be sampled within a region or
   state varied with the index chosen; with specific indices, however, a
   10\% change in mean index value could be detected with a sample of 50 to
   100 fields.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance, size distribution and bacterial colonization of
   transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) were monitored in the Kattegat
   (Denmark) at weekly intervals throughout the spring (February-May)
   encompassing the spring diatom bloom. These recently discovered
   particles are believed to be formed from colloidal organic material
   exuded by phytoplankton and bacteria, and may have significant
   implications for pelagic flux processes. During this study, the number
   concentration of TEP (>1 mu m) ranged from 3 x 10(3) to 6 x 10(4) ml(-1)
   and the volume concentration between 0.3 and 9.0 p.p.m.; they were most
   abundant in the surface waters subsequent to the spring phytoplankton
   bloom. The range of TEP (encased) volume concentration was similar to
   that of the phytoplankton, although at times TEP volume concentration
   exceeded that of the phytoplankton by two orders of magnitude. The TEP
   size distribution followed a power law, with the abundance of particles
   scaling with particle diameter((B+1)). The seasonal average estimate of
   beta (2.3) was not significantly different from three, consistent with
   TEP being formed by shear coagulation from smaller particles. However,
   date-specific estimates of beta differed significantly from three,
   probably because TEP are fractal. All TEP were colonized by bacteria,
   and bacteria were both attached to the surface of and embedded in TEP.
   Yet the number of attached bacteria per TEP was related neither to the
   surface area nor the volume, but rather scaled with TEP size raised to
   an exponent of similar to 1.5. We argue that this is consistent with TEP
   being fractal. Between 0.5 and 20\% of the total bacterial population
   were attached to TEP. Crude estimates of TEP carbon concentrations
   combined with considerations of turnover times suggest that TEP and
   their colloidal precursors may represent a hitherto understudied but
   potentially significant pathway for dissolved organic carbon in the
   ocean.}},

Abstract = {{From 1981-90, the osprey population along the Umpqua River between
   Roseburg and Reedsport, Oregon increased by 153\% (17\% annual rate).
   The first observed decrease in the population occurred in 1991 when one
   previously occupied breeding territory became vacant. Management
   activities on USDI Bureau of Land Management administered lands within
   the study area between 1981-88 consisted of the installation of 24
   nesting platforms and 17 accessory perches. During this study, 15 of the
   platforms were occupied by breeding ospreys accounting for over 40\% of
   the total population increase along the Umpqua River. Productivity
   surveys using either ground survey (1981 and 1984) or helicopter survey
   (1982, 1983, 1985-91) techniques estimated an average productivity of
   1.21 (range = 0.87-1.86) fledglings/occupied territory, 1.33 (range =
   0.93-1.93) fledglings/breeding attempt, and 2.04 (range = 1.50-2.47)
   fledglings/successful breeding attempt. Platform sites were more
   productive than natural nest substrates but the difference was not
   significant. The observed rate of increase of the osprey population
   between 1981-1990 was similar to that reported elsewhere where nest
   platforms have been installed to increase osprey numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal dynamics of Zostera noltii was studied during 1984 in Arcachon
   Bay, France. In this Bay, 2. noltii colonizes 70 km(2), i.e.
   approximately 50\% of the total area, while 2. marina occupies only 4
   km(2). Densities and length of vegetative and generative shoots and
   above-ground and below-ground biomasses were monitored in four meadows
   which differed according to their location in the Bay, tidal level and
   sediment composition. Three of these meadows were homogeneous,
   well-established beds whilst the fourth was under colonization and
   patchy. Shoot densities and maximal below-ground biomass were lower in
   the inner silty seagrass bed than in the sandy meadows located in the
   centre of the Bay. Maximal aboveground biomasses were similar in the two
   population types. In the well-established beds, vegetative shoot
   densities, above-ground and below-ground biomasses showed a unimodal
   pattern with minima in winter (4000 to 9000 shoots . m(-2), 40 to 80 g
   DW . m(-2), and 40 to 60 g DW . m(-2), respectively) and maxima in
   summer (11000 to 22000 shoots . m(-2), 110 to 150 g DW . m(-2), and 140
   to 200 g DW . m(-2), respectively). Reproductive shoots were observed
   from the beginning of June until the end of September, except in the
   colonizing bed where they persisted until December. Furthermore, in the
   latter, maximal reproductive shoot density was higher (2600 shoots .
   m(-2)) than in the established beds (650 to 960 shoots . m(-2)). The
   total production of Z. noltii in Arcachon Bay was estimated to
   approximately 35.6 . 10(6) kg DW . y(-1) (19.4 . 10(6) kg DW . y(-1) for
   above-ground parts and 16.2 . 10(6) kg DW . y(-1) for below-ground
   parts).}},

Abstract = {{The broodstock reproductive condition of doughboy scallops, Chlamys
   (Mimachlamys) asperrima Lamarck, in Jervis Bay, Australia, was monitored
   fortnightly for 2 y. Gonosomatic index (GSI), gonad weight, and
   macroscopic gonadal appearance were used to assess changes in the
   reproductive status of the population. In common with C. asperrima in
   Tasmania, a winter-spring peak in reproductive activity was observed,
   although macroscopically ripe (mature, ready-to-spawn) individuals were
   present in most collections. Peaks in reproductive indices occurred in
   June and August 1992 and in September 1993, during which partial
   spawning was evident. Male and female development was synchronous,
   although female scallops maintained higher GSIs and macroscopically
   higher levels of gonadal development and, at their reproductive peak,
   had higher calorific values for gonadal tissue. Female gonads were also
   consistently heavier than those of equivalent-sized males, although
   adductor muscle weight in males was on average 9\% heavier than that of
   females. Observations of reproductive condition indicate that although
   the optimal times for the harvest of C. asperrima in Jervis Bay are
   likely to be similar to that of southern stocks, the presence of
   reproductively capable individuals at most times of the year in Jervis
   Bay could be of advantage in the hatchery production of the species and
   in the provision of embryos for ecotoxilogical studies.}},

Title = {{Enduring social relationships in a population of crab-eating zorros,
   Cerdocyon thous, in Amazonian Brazil (Carnivora, Canidae)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{239}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1) Crab-eating zorros, Cerdocyon thous, in Amazonian Brazil weighed 5.2
   kg (S.D. 0.6, n = 19), exhibited no sexual dimorphism. lived in social
   units of 2-5 adults of >1 year old, and occupied territories (restricted
   polygons) of 532 ha (range 48-1042 ha, n = 21).
   2) The zorros were omnivorous, fruit being the most frequent food
   (occurring in 57\% of 72 faeces in the dry season) comprising 26.4\% by
   volume of undigested faecal remains. Insects were frequently eaten
   (86\%), and vertebrates rarely (15.2\%).
   3) Zorros were territorial. The ranges of neighbours overlapped
   minimally and were very stable in configuration, both from month to
   month and between dry and wet seasons. Members of each social unit
   shared on average 88.3\% of 200 x 200 m grid cells within their
   territory. Members of male-female breeding pairs were within 100 m of
   each other for 63\% of the activity period. their proximity being
   greatest during the mating season (July-August). Parents travelled in
   close company with their adult-sized offspring, and stayed within 100 m
   for up to 93.3\% of the activity period.
   4) Territories differed in habitat composition. Overall, zorros spent
   most time in wooded savanna (33.9\%) and scrub (30.5\%). They did not
   utilize habitats in direct proportion to their availability, using some
   more (e.g. scrub) and some less (e.g. open savanna) than expected.
   Habitat preferences differed between wet and dry seasons. with elevated
   habitats being favoured during the wet season.
   5) Individuals differed in their habitat utilization, and parents had
   different habitat usage to their yearling offspring; this difference was
   exaggerated in the dry season when the yearlings used low-lying habitats
   apparently disfavoured by the parents. Differences in habitat
   utilization between group members were least in the wet season, when
   widespread flooding forced the shared use of higher ground.
   6) Each of two social units larger than two individuals comprised a pair
   and their three adult-sized offspring (totalling five males and one
   female). In three cases, a yearling daughter was present in the breeding
   season, but none of these bred. Non-breeding offspring were seen
   frequently in the whelping area and In close company with the breeding
   pair's cubs. This is the first proof of group-living in South American
   zorros.
   7) Five dispersal events were monitored, and revealed a `good neighbour'
   strategy in which newly formed pairs set up their territories adjoining
   their natal territories. In each case individuals returned
   intermittently to their original territory where they were in close and
   amicable company with their parents. One male, having dispersed,
   returned home frequently without his mate to tend the next generation of
   his parents' cubs. Of four dispersing males, two subsequently returned
   to their natal group following the deaths of their mates at least 3-13
   months after their initial dispersal, in one case after breeding
   elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{The species composition, catch and mortality rates of sea turtles
   captured incidentally by the tiger prawn fishery on Australia's northern
   coast in 1989 and 1990 were estimated by monitoring the fishery's catch.
   In 1990, the delayed rate of mortality from damage was estimated and the
   size composition was measured. Five species of turtles were captured:
   the flatback (Natator depressa, 59\% of the total), loggerhead (Caretta
   caretta, 10\%), olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea, 12\%), green turtle
   (Chelonia mydas, 8\%) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata, 5\%). The
   turtle catches varied with water depth: the highest catch rates (0.068
   +/- 0.006 turtles per trawl) were from trawls in water between 20 and 30
   m deep, relatively few turtles (10\%) were captured in water deeper than
   40 m (25\% of trawls). Catch rates varied with time of year: the highest
   catch rates were 0.098 (+/- 0.013) turtles per trawl in winter. There
   was no significant difference in the overall catch rate (chi(2) = 0.047;
   p = 0.8111, df = 1) but a significant difference in mortality rate
   (chi(2) = 3.99; p < 0.05; df = 1) between the two years. The incidence
   of capture in the commercial fishery was 0.051 (+/- 0.003) turtles per
   trawl towed for about 180 min, with 0.007 ( +/- 0.001) turtles per trawl
   drowning in the nets. There were no significant differences in the catch
   and mortality rates between the two years for any of the turtle species
   except the loggerhead, which had a significantly (chi(2) = 11.029; p =
   0.0013; df = 1) lower catch rate in 1990 (0.002 +/- 0.001 turtles per
   trawl) than in 1989 (0.008 +/- 0.002 turtles per trawl), and a
   significantly higher mortality in 1990 (33\%) than in 1989 (19\%). Catch
   rates and mortality varied between the species: the flatback had the
   highest catch rate (0.030 +/- 0.002 turtles per trawl) but the lowest
   mortality (10.9\%); the loggerhead had a catch rate of 0.005 +/- 0.001
   turtles per trawl, and high mortality (21.9\%); the olive ridley had a
   catch rate of 0.006 +/- 0.001 turtles per trawl and a low mortality
   (12.5\%); the green turtle's catch rate was 0.004 +/- 0.001 per trawl
   and mortality 12.0\%; the hawksbill had the lowest catch rate (0.002 +/-
   0.001 turtles per trawl) but highest mortality (26.4\%). Based on the
   fishing effort (27 049 d for 1989 and 25 746 d for 1990), we estimate
   that 5 503 (+/- 424) turtles were caught and returned to the sea in 1989
   and 5 238 (+/- 404) in 1990, of which 567 +/- 140 drowned in 1989 and
   943 +/- 187 in 1990. In 1990, an estimated 25\% of all captured turtles
   suffered some non-lethal damage; an estimated 21\% of turtles were
   captured comatose and 4\% were injured. We conclude that, considering
   other threats, trawl-induced drowning is not the major impact on turtle
   populations in northern Australia, but that measures to reduce drowning
   and delayed mortality would be desirable.}},

Abstract = {{I monitored the populations of 2 fishes on a coral reef in St. Croix,
   U.S. Virgin Islands, from 1980 to 1995 to determine if they could track
   changes in their habitat. Starting in the mid-1970s, white band disease
   killed all the elkhorn corals Acropora palmate, providing access to a
   variety of boring organisms that create the cavities inhabited by the
   spinyhead blenny Acanthemblemaria spinosa and the roughhead blenny A.
   aspera. As the corals became more heavily bored, they were weakened and
   collapsed, providing more of the low habitat occupied by roughheads and
   less of the high habitat occupied by spinyheads. This structural change
   was generally gradual but Hurricane Hugo destroyed almost all the
   remaining standing dead corals in 1989. Both species increased in
   density until 1989 when the sudden reduction of high habitat caused a
   decrease in spinyhead population density. In contrast, roughheads
   continued their population growth until 1991 after which they also
   declined. Although previous work has shown that spinyheads can displace
   roughheads from preferred habitat, spinyheads did not increase their
   numbers close to the reef surface as the high corals collapsed. I
   hypothesize that their inflexible minimum height is due to their
   previously demonstrated higher metabolic rate which constrains them to
   the higher locations where planktonic food is more abundant.
   Consequently, the species mix shifted from one of spinyheads with
   extremely rare roughheads in 1980 to one dominated by roughheads with
   few spinyheads in 1995. This precise tracking of a changing environment
   suggests resource limitation and is counter to the widespread view that
   coral reef fish assemblages are largely unsaturated systems consisting
   of open, recruitment-limited populations. The fishes studied here may be
   atypical, however, and it is suggested that more studies with a
   mechanistic approach may provide insight into reef fish assemblage
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{There has been considerable debate about both the mechanisms controlling
   primary production, and the interpretation of data from Fe-enrichment
   experiments conducted in high nitrate-low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions.
   This paper presents results of 3 in vitro Fe-enrichment experiments
   performed in May 1993 and May 1994 at Ocean Station Papa (OSP) in the NE
   subarctic Pacific. Expt 1 (May 1993) considered jointly the influence of
   both Fe supply and microzooplankton herbivory on algal stocks, while the
   second (May 1993) investigated the influence of Fe supply on the
   partitioning of C, N and Fe between algal size classes. The third study
   (May 1994) monitored changes in phytoplankton stocks in Fe-enriched
   carboys containing mesozooplankton. Assuming similar environmental
   conditions in May 1993 and 1994, then the combined findings indicate
   that under ambient conditions autotrophic cells <5 mu m compose >70 \%
   of algal biomass, primarily utilized ammonium, showed no Fe-mediated
   enhancement of N-normalized nitrate or ammonium uptake, and were thus
   unlikely to be Fe-limited. Although the coupling between grazer
   mortality and algal growth of these cells (g/mu) was ca 0.71 +/- 0.25,
   they grew at close to maximal rates but exhibited negligible net growth
   rates, suggesting strong grazer control. Dissolved iron (DFe) supply
   promoted a rapid increase in the abundance of large, initially rare,
   diatoms (mainly Nitzschia spp.) over 6 d, elevated diatom growth rates
   to close to their theoretical maximum and increased rates of
   incorporation of N-normalized nitrate and Fe by these cells over time.
   Unlike the small cells, stocks of large autotrophs also increased in the
   controls; DFe measurements indicate that this was probably due to
   inadvertent Fe contamination. The development of a phytoplankton
   population, of a cell size probably too large to be grazed at a
   significant rate by microzooplankton, resulted in a decoupling of
   herbivory and algal growth. In addition, mesozooplankton herbivory
   appeared unable to prevent the accumulation of these large cells; in May
   1994, Fe supply prompted an 8-fold increase in algal stocks over 6 d in
   carboys where grazers equivalent to the maximum annual in situ pelagic
   abundance were present. The findings agree with the theories of others,
   that Fe supply rather than grazing provides the ultimate control over
   the phytoplankton community in the NE subarctic Pacific.}},

Abstract = {{We used sequence variation within 297 bp of control region mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) amplified from 53 lesser long-nosed bats, Leptonycteris
   curasoae (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) captured at 13 locations in
   south-western United States and Mexico and one site in Venezuela to
   infer population structure and possible migration routes of this
   endangered nectar- and fruit-eating species. Phylogenetic analysis using
   maximum parsimony and UPGMA confirmed species and subspecies
   distinctions within Leptonycteris and revealed two clades exhibiting 3\%
   sequence divergence within the Mexican subspecies, L. c. yerbabuenae.
   Even though many roosts contained L. c. yerbabuenae from both clades,
   weak population structure was detected both by a correlation between
   genetic differentiation, F-st, and geographical distance and by a
   cladistic estimate of the number of migration events required to align
   bat sequences with geographical location on maximum parsimony, as
   compared to random, trees. Three results suggest that L. c. yerbabuenae
   are more likely to migrate between sites along the Pacific coast of
   Mexico or along the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental than
   between these regions. (1) Seventeen of 20 bats which shared an
   identical sequence were captured up to 1800 km apart but within the same
   putative migration corridor. (2) Residuals from a regression of F-st on
   distance were greater between than within these regions. (3) Fewer
   migration events were required to align bats with these two groups than
   expected from random assignment. We recommend analysing independent
   genetic data and monitoring bat visitation to roost sites during
   migration to confirm these postulated movements.}},

Abstract = {{Fungicide sensitivity of Sphaerotheca fuliginea was monitored during
   powdery mildew epidemics in research plots and production fields of
   pumpkin. Benomyl-resistant isolates (insensitive to 200 mu g/ml) were
   detected in all populations before benomyl was used. The only
   triadimefon-resistant isolate (insensitive to 100 mu g/ml) detected
   prior to treatment was near triadimefon-treated plants. Populations in
   nontreated fields did not change appreciably. Fungicide application had
   a large impact on fungicide resistance. Proportion of resistant isolates
   in research plots treated four times with triadimefon plus
   chlorothalonil shifted from 0 to 81\% for triadimefon and from 30 to
   69\% for benomyl between 15 August and 19 September 1991; proportion
   shifted from 3 to 100\% for triadimefon and from 10 to 44\% for benomyl
   between 14 August and 17 September 1992. The shift occurred rapidly:
   proportion of resistant isolates shifted within 2 weeks from 0 to 96\%
   for triadimefon and from 10 to 74\% for benomyl following two
   applications of triadimefon in a commercial field in August 1992. Most
   isolates (87\%) from fungicide-treated fields tolerated triadimefon at
   100 or 200 mu g/ml. These were considered triadimefon-resistant because
   fungicide performance declined during September. However, control was
   commercially acceptable. Of 122 isolates collected from
   fungicide-treated pumpkin, one was benomyl-resistant,
   triadimefon-sensitive; 20 were benomyl-sensitive, triadimefon-resistant;
   six were sensitive to both fungicides; and 95 were resistant to both
   with 77 of these insensitive to triadimefon at 200 mu g/ml. In contrast,
   57 of 92 isolates from nontreated populations were sensitive to both
   fungicides, none were resistant to both, and 32 were resistant to
   benomyl.}},

   of changes in plant communities following fires, and monitoring the fate
   of individual plants after burning.
   Fire temperatures were strongly influenced by the physiognomy of the
   vegetation, dominated by tussocks of Calamagrostis spp. Temperatures
   were highest amongst the upper leaves of the tussock (sometimes > 500
   degrees C). The middle levels of the tussock experienced temperatures in
   excess of 400 degrees C, but in the dense leaf bases temperatures were
   often below 65 degrees C. On the ground between tussocks, temperatures
   were variable, whereas 2 cm below ground temperatures failed to reach 65
   degrees C.
   Plant survival depended on the intensity of the fire and the plant's
   position within the tussock structure. Survival was often the result of
   high temperature avoidance (with buds shielded by other plant parts or
   buried beneath the soil surface).
   Post-fire Calamagrostis tiller mortality rates were high and tussock
   regrowth was slow. Some other species appear to maintain their
   populations by exploiting this recovery phase for seedling establishment
   on tussocks.
   Between tussocks, changes of occupancy at the level of the individual
   plants were greater after fire than in control vegetation. Most
   transitions were random. Those which departed from random often involved
   gaps and were related to post-fire mortality, regrowth from below-ground
   parts, colonisation or, in the case of a clonal mat-forming species, to
   spatial rearrangement of rosettes. Recovery was slower at higher
   altitude. Recovery was much slower in burned plots when the upper 2 cm
   of soil was removed (along with buried plant parts) compared with burned
   plots.
   Qualitative observations suggest that recovery may consist of a cyclical
   process, mediated by the serial dominance of several species that are
   physiognomically important.
   The frequency of fires determines the amount of fuel accumulated within
   grass tussocks and some plants may be unable to survive repeated
   burning. Chance survival of species in unburned patches of vegetation
   and random colonisation of gaps may be important determinants of
   subsequent community structure.}},

   predominant native plants flowering at sampling sites during the
   November to March period included Melaleuca uncinata, Melaleuca

   found on native vegetation. No M. rotundata prepupae were found in 12
   microdomiciles placed in a nearby Conservation Park. The results of the

Abstract = {{The routine oxygen consumption of redbreast tilapia, Tilapia rendalli
   exposed to silt from the Phalaborwa Barrage was investigated under
   controlled laboratory conditions. Exposure of adult fish to sublethal
   concentrations of silt did alter routine oxygen consumption by causing
   increased rates (53-77\% from initial) of oxygen consumption. This
   indicates that sublethal levels of suspended silt concentrations results
   in an increase in oxygen consumption by the fish due to an increase in
   metabolic rate associated with increased activity and stress. From the
   laboratory experiments, it can therefore be predicted that sublethal
   releases from the Phalaborwa Barrage will stress the resident fish
   populations. However, the extent of the impact on the fish population
   will depend on factors such as frequency, duration and severity of
   exposure as well as the species in question. Long term monitoring of the
   fish population below the Phalaborwa Barrage is therefore essential.}},

Abstract = {{A red tide due to Gymnodinium mikimoloi (Dinophyceae) occurred at
   Harima-nada, the Seto Inland Sea (Japan), in summer 1995. Throughout the
   development and collapse of the red tide, abundance of G. mikimoloi and
   its potential predators (heterotrophic dinoflagellates and ciliates) was
   monitored daily together with environmental variables. While a nitrate
   and phosphate dine was present at around 15 m, G. mikimotoi
   concentrations increased rapidly for about a week in the subsurface
   layer (5 to 15 m). Then the population suddenly accumulated at the
   surface layer in the daytime and formed a red tide (ca 3 x 10(3)
   ml(-1)). Following the red tide formation, the abundance of naked
   heterotrophic dinoflagellates (h-dinos) started to increase.
   Subsequently, the abundance of the tintinnid ciliate Favella ehrenbergii
   increased (ca 10 ml(-1)) and apparently consumed G. mikimotoi and
   h-dinos completely within a few days. On the basis of these results, the
   ecological differences between G. mikimotoi and Chattonella antiqua
   (Raphidophyceae; another representative red tide forming species in the
   Seto Inland Sea) are discussed, as well as the importance of
   microzooplankton grazing for the collapse of red tides.}},

Abstract = {{Myrmecochores are plants with seeds adapted for ant dispersal. This
   specialized dispersal syndrome may provide Erythronium americanum seeds
   with protection from predators within the eastern deciduous forests. To
   determine the adaptive significance of myrmecochory in E. americanum
   seed removal rates and seed predation in relation to seed release date
   and location along the Potomac River in Langley, Virginia, were
   examined. The number of seeds removed from four exclosure treatments
   were monitored two times in 1992 and three times in 1993 within
   floodplain and hilltop populations of E. americanum. Overall, seed
   removal was greatest from control depots, and E. americanum seeds were
   removed at nearly the same rate from predator-exclusion depots,
   indicating that removal from open depots is largely due to ant removal.
   Ants removed significantly more seeds than predators in the first 48 h
   of seed exposure and could potentially remove all E. americanum seeds
   before nightfall. Aphaenogaster rudis was identified as the primary
   disperser of E. americanum. Seeds placed in depots after the natural
   seed release period were discovered more quickly and removed by ants at
   a significantly higher rate than seeds released at the natural date.
   These results suggest that ant dispersal of E. americanum seeds reduces
   the likelihood of seed predation.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic Cyphon (Coleoptera: Scirtidae) larvae are characteristic
   inhabitants of small seasonal ponds across a wetland at Aberlady Bay,
   Scotland, UK, but not found in adjacent, large permanent ponds. This
   distribution may be an example of the use of spatial refugia to escape
   abundant invertebrate predators found in large ponds. Notonecta glauca
   is a regular component of the permanent waters. but erratic colonist of
   the small seasonal ponds. The surface dwelling habit, activity and lack
   of intrinsic defences of Cyphon larvae make them very vulnerable to N.
   glauca. N. glauca was added to seven of the small, seasonal ponds and
   numbers of Cyphon larvae in these treatment ponds were monitored and
   compared to those in six control ponds. By the end of the experiment
   Cyphon numbers in treatment ponds were reduced by more than 50\%
   compared to control, despite differences in pond hydrology, position,
   vegetation and other fauna present across replicates, suggesting that
   predation is an ecologically important process affecting the
   distribution of Cyphon larvae.}},

Abstract = {{The Episodic Response Project (ERP) was an interdisciplinary study
   designed to address uncertainties about the occurrence, nature, and
   biological effects of episodic acidification of streams in the
   northeastern United States. The ERP research consisted of intensive
   studies of the chemistry and biological effects of episodes in 13
   streams draining forested watersheds in the three study regions: the
   Northern Appalachian region of Pennsylvania and the Catskill and
   Adirondack Mountains of New York. Wet deposition was measured in each of
   the three study regions. Using automated instruments and samplers,
   discharge and chemistry of each stream was monitored intensively from
   fall 1988 through spring 1990. Biological studies focused on brook trout
   and native forage fish. Experimental approaches included in situ
   bioassays, radio transmitter studies of fish movement, and fish
   population studies. This paper provides an overview of the ERP,
   describes the methodology used in hydrologic and water chemistry
   components of the study, and summarizes the characteristics of the study
   sites, including the climatic and deposition conditions during the ERP
   and the general chemical characteristics of the study streams.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the Episodic Response Project (ERP), we studied the effects
   of episodic acidification on fish in 13 small streams in the
   northeastern United States: four streams in the Adirondack region of New
   York, four streams in the Catskills, New York, and five streams in the
   northern Appalachian Plateau, Pennsylvania. In situ bioassays with brook
   trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and a forage fish species (blacknose dace
   (Rhinichthys atratulus), mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi), or slimy
   sculpin (Cottus cognatus), depending on the region) measured direct
   toxicity. Movements of individual brook trout, in relation to stream
   chemistry, were monitored using radiotelemetry. Electrofishing surveys
   assessed fish community status and the density and biomass of brook
   trout in each stream. During low flow, all streams except one had
   chemical conditions considered suitable for the survival and
   reproduction of most fish species (median pH 6.0-7.2 during low flow;
   inorganic Al < 60 mu g/L). ERP streams with suitable conditions during
   low flow, but moderate-to-severe episodic acidification during high
   flow, had higher fish mortality in bioassays, net downstream movement of
   brook trout during events, and lower brook trout density and biomass
   compared to nonacidic streams, and lacked acid-sensitive fish species
   (blacknose dace and sculpin). Movement of trout into refugia (areas with
   higher pH and lower Al) during episodes partially mitigated the adverse
   effects of episodes. Recolonization from alkaline tributaries or
   microhabitats can maintain low densities of fish in streams that
   experience severe acidic episodes, but it is not sufficient to sustain
   fish densities and community composition at levels expected in the
   absence of these episodes. Fish responses to acid-base chemistry were
   fairly consistent across regions. In general, trout abundance was
   reduced and acid-sensitive fish species were absent from ERP streams
   with median pH < 5.0-5.2 during high flow and inorganic Al > 100-200 mu
   g/L. We conclude that episodic acidification can have long-term effects
   on fish communities in small streams.}},

Abstract = {{We define criteria for documenting episodic acidification of amphibian
   breeding habitats and examine whether episodic acidification is
   responsible for observed declines of amphibian populations in the Rocky
   Mountains. Anthropogenic episodic acidification, caused by atmospheric
   deposition of sulfate and nitrate, occurs when the concentration of acid
   anions increases relative to the concentration of base cations,
   resulting in a decrease in acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC). However,
   because several natural processes can also depress ANC, monitoring pH
   and ANC alone cannot provide evidence that episodic acidification of
   amphibian habitats is anthropogenic. We examined published data on water
   chemistry from central Colorado and southern Wyoming for evidence of
   episodic acidification, and we also compared original water chemistry
   data to observations of amphibian breeding phenology at three sites in
   northern Colorado. There is limited evidence that anthropogenic episodic
   acidification may occur in high-elevation habitats in the Rocky
   Mountains, but there is no evidence that episodic acidification has led
   to acidic conditions (ANC < 0) or that amphibian embryos are present
   during the initial phase of snowmelt when episodic acidification might
   occur. The declines of some amphibian species in the Rocky Mountains are
   more likely due either to natural or anthropogenic factors other than
   acidic deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Loew), that are reared,
   sterilized and released for maintenance of a fly free zone in south
   Texas and for population eradication in California are routinely chilled
   for 1 to 2 h to facilitate handling and dispersal. While a number of
   behavioral, physical and physiological characteristics are routinely
   monitored as part of a quality control program, the effect of the
   chilling process on the ability of these males to attract wild females
   has not been evaluated. Tests were performed to compare the mate
   attracting effectiveness of mass reared, sterilized, chilled males with
   sterile males that had not been chilled and with recently colonized
   males. Tests were performed with two recently colonized strains of
   females in a large cage and males of the three types in plastic cups set
   on top of the cage. Controls consisted of empty cups. Results showed no
   significant differences among the three types of males. In tests with
   the most recently collected (least laboratory adapted) wild strain of
   females, the chilled males attracted the most females. Fly age and time
   of day were both significantly related to total attractiveness of males.
   Number of females responding to males per day increased over the
   five-day test period. The time period when female response was greatest
   was variable among the tests.}},

Abstract = {{A cancer epidemiologist recently said that `'adduct measurement has so
   far been of little use to epidemiological research.'' This remark gives
   us a starting point for the discussion of the purposes of measuring
   macromolecule adducts that originate from electrophilic compounds or
   metabolites in humans and animals. Historically methods for adduct
   monitoring were developed as a means of determining target doses that,
   combined with measurements of genotoxic potencies, could be used for
   risk assessment. With mass spectrometric methods, adducts can be
   quantified at levels that are thousands of times lower than those in
   which the cancer incidence associated with this exposure is detectable
   in disease-epidemiological studies. Furthermore, mass spectrometric
   techniques permit identification of the chemical structure of the
   adduct, particularly in the case of hemoglobin adducts. Adduct
   measurement therefore constitutes not only a means of risk estimation
   but it may be used as a complement of disease epidemiology in situations
   in which, for statistical reasons, the risk is too low to be
   delectable-which does not signify that the risk is acceptably low. It
   also gives a possibility of identification of the dangerous components
   in mixed exposures and of the relevant reactive intermediates in cases
   of complex metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies have taken advantage of a number of strategies
   to monitor human populations for mortality, incidence, and exposure to
   hazardous environmental agents. These studies have been compromised by
   the lack of individual exposure assessment data that precisely
   quantifies internal dose. As methods improve in analytical chemistry and
   molecular biology, direct biological monitoring of exposed populations
   is possible. Biomarkers have been developed and validated in exposed
   populations that quantify individual exposure, susceptibility, and early
   markers of health effects and can be used to study relationships between
   exposures and environmentally induced diseases. This paper provides
   background on the state of the art of human populations monitoring and,
   through a series of case studies, provides examples of novel biomarkers
   of exposure, susceptibility, and effect that highlight new opportunities
   for biomonitoring. Prevention of human disease due to environmental
   contaminants can be accomplished by implementing strategies such as
   those discussed to monitor exposures and early health effects in human
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic bomb survivors are a population suitable for studying the
   relationship between somatic mutation and cancer risk because their
   exposure doses are relatively well known and their dose responses in
   terms oi cancer risk have also been thoroughly studied. An analysis has
   been made of erythrocyte glycophorin A (GPA) gene mutations in 1,226
   atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The GPA mutation
   frequency (Mf) increased slightly but significantly with age at the time
   of measurement and with the number of cigarettes smoked. After
   adjustment for the effect of smoking, the Mf was significantly higher in
   males than in females and higher in Hiroshima than in Nagasaki. All of
   these characteristics of the background GPA Mf were in accord with those
   of solid tumor incidence obtained from an earlier epidemiological study
   of A-bomb survivors. Analysis of the dose effect on Mf revealed the
   doubling dose to be about 1.20 Sv and the minimum dose for detection of
   a significant increase to be about 0.24 Sv. No significant dose effect
   for difference in sex, city, or age at the time of bombing was observed.
   Interestingly, the doubling dose for the GPA Mf approximated that for
   solid cancer incidence (1.59 Sv). And the minimum dose for detection was
   not inconsistent with the data for solid cancer incidence. The dose
   effect was significantly higher in those diagnosed with cancer before or
   after measurement than in those without a history of cancer. These
   findings are consistent with the hypothesis that somatic mutations are
   the main cause of excess cancer risk from radiation exposure.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HP) concentration and the
   creatinine-adjusted 1-HP concentration in 644 randomly selected Dutch
   children aged 1-6 years and living in five areas with roughly different
   levels of polycyclic atomatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil and ambient
   air. The presence of other factors that might influence the exposure to
   PAHs was studied using a questionnaire. To evaluate the reliability of a
   single urinary 1-HP determination, measurements were repeated after 3
   weeks for approximately 200 children. The mean urinary 1-HP content of
   the total study population was 2.06 nmol/l. This varied from 1.58 nmol/l
   in the reference area (Flevoland) to 2.71 nmol/l in the valley of the
   Geul were higher (p<0.01) and those of children from a suburb of
   Amsterdam were lower (p<0.01) than those of children from the reference
   area. The possible ambient environment related differences were probably
   too small to be detected in the variations of the intake of PAHs from
   the daily diet. The reliability of a single 1-HP measurement was low.
   Similar results were obtained with the creatinine-adjusted data. In one
   neighbourhood built on coal-mine tailings the urinary 1-HP content in
   the upper soil layer of the garden of their homes. However, this
   association was not found for the children from the other neighbourhood
   built on coal-mine tailings and with similar PAH levels in soil.}},

Abstract = {{We have monitored 30 pesticide-exposed workers and 30 matched controls
   for expression of chromosome aberrations (CA) and sister chromatid
   exchanges (SCE) in their lymphocytes. Peripheral blood cultures were set
   up within 3 hr after the collection of samples, and four cultures were
   set up from each donor. For CA analysis, 100 complete metaphase cells
   from each donor were evaluated. For the SCE assay, 50 complete metaphase
   cells from each donor were analyzed. The CA and SCE data were analyzed
   for differences between the two groups using the chi(2) and the
   Student's t-test, respectively. From the CA analysis it was obvious that
   the overwhelming majority of aberrations were chromatid breaks and
   isochromatid breaks; therefore, only these data are presented and used
   for statistical analysis. Isochromatid breaks were counted as two breaks
   each and chromatid breaks as one in calculating the total chromatid
   break frequencies. Statistical evaluation of the data indicates that:
   there is no significant difference (p > 0.05; chi(2) test) between the
   exposed and the nonexposed groups based on chromatid breaks per 100
   cells (1.2 +/- 0.3 and 1.5 +/- 0.2, respectively) and total chromatid
   breaks per 100 cells (1.7 +/- 0.3 and 2.1 +/- 0.2, respectively). No
   significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05, Student's
   t-test) was observed with SCE frequencies (5.0 +/- 1.1 and 4.8 +/- 0.9,
   respectively). Linear regression analysis indicates that the data were
   not influenced by age, cigarette smoking, or alcohol consumption. It is
   assuring that the exposure conditions among these Indian farmers have
   not caused detectable increases of chromosome damage using standard
   assays; this suggests the lack of serious long-term health problems.
   However, periodic monitoring of such exposed populations should be
   conducted using the same or other more sensitive assays. In addition,
   other populations with exposure to different types of pesticides in
   Colombia should also be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The induction of a mutator phenotype has been hypothesized to cause the
   accumulation of multiple mutations in the development of cancer. Recent
   evidence suggests that the mutator phenotype is associated with DNA
   repair deficiencies. We have been using a challenge assay to study
   exposed populations to test our hypothesis that exposure to
   environmental toxicants can induce DNA repair deficiency in somatic
   cells. In this assay, lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro to challenge
   cells to repair the radiation-induced DNA strand breaks. An increase of
   chromosome aberrations in the challenged cells from toxicant-exposed
   populations compared to nonexposed populations is used to indicate
   abnormal DNA repair response. From studies of cigarette smokers,
   butadiene-exposed workers, and uranium-exposed residents, the assay
   showed that these exposed populations had mutagen-induced abnormal DNA
   repair response. The phenomenon was also demonstrated using experimental
   animals. Mice were exposed in vivo to two different doses of
   N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine (MNNG) and their lymphocytes were
   challenged with one dose of a radiomimetic chemical, bleomycin, in
   vitro. These challenged lymphocytes showed an MNNG dose-dependent
   increase of abnormal DNA repair response. in a population that was
   potentially exposed to teratogens-mothers having children with neural
   tube defects-lymphocytes from these mothers did not have the abnormal
   response in our assay. In studies with patients, we reported that
   lymphocytes from Down's syndrome patients have the abnormal DNA repair
   response. Lymphocytes from skin cancer-prone patients (epidermodysplasia
   verruciformis) have normal response to gamma-ray challenge but abnormal
   response to UV-light challenge. These patient studies also indicate that
   the challenge assay is useful in documenting the radiosensitivity of
   Down's syndrome and the UV sensitivity in EV patients. In most cases,
   the challenge assay is more sensitive in detecting biological effects
   than the standard chromosome aberration assay. Our series of studies
   indicates that the challenge assay can be used to document biological
   effects from exposure to mutagens and that the effect is an abnormal DNA
   repair response. This abnormality can increase the risk for development
   of cancer. The repair deficiency is currently being validated using a
   plasmid transfection (host-reactivaton) assay. The need to integrate
   chromosome aberration and the challenge assays with other relevant
   assays for better documentation of biological effects and for more
   precise prediction of health risk will be presented. Our experience in
   using genetic polymorphism and host-reactivation assays will be
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Health effects from environmental toxicants may be a more serious
   problem in developing countries compared with developed countries
   because the problem is potentiated by other factors: a) the lack of or
   failure to enforce regulations, which allows human exposures to
   genotoxic agents; b) undernourishment of the lower economic and social
   classes that comprise the most exposed populations from industrial and
   agricultural activities; and c) parasitic infections that afflict a wide
   range of populations in both urban and rural areas. Data on the
   genotoxic effects of different types of exposures, including
   environmental exposures (natural and industrial), occupational
   exposures, and infections and medical treatments, are presented and
   discussed with the point of view that all these factors must be taken
   into account with respect to regulation and the protection of human
   health. Occupational exposures in developing countries are higher than
   in developed countries due to lack of stringent regulations, lack of
   knowledge of the risks involved, and the negligence of workers. General
   pollution is another important issue since developed countries have
   established strict regulations and risky industrial processes are being
   exported to developing countries, along with banned substances and
   dangerous industrial wastes. it should be emphasized that stringent
   regulations in developed countries will not prevent exposures in the
   long term because toxic substances that are released into the
   environment will ultimately reach all our future generations.}},

Abstract = {{Population monitoring using methods of molecular epidemiology combined
   with reliable data on exposure is an extremely powerful approach to
   determine the effect of mutagens on human populations. Although human
   blood and urine have traditionally been used for biomonitoring, an
   increase in the use of placental and buccal smear samples should be
   expected. As biomarkers of exposure, DNA strand breaks and hemoglobin
   and albumin adducts seem to be most sensitive. As biomarkers of
   response, cytogenetic analysis determining chromosome aberrations or
   micronuclei has been widely used. Additional information can be obtained
   by using the chromosome painting technique and by determining gene
   mutations at the hprt locus; however, epidemiological studies exhibiting
   a relationship between these biomarkers and environmental pollution are
   still lacking. The use of sperm to analyze the effect of environmental
   mutagens in germ cells (e.g, sperm morphology and sperm aneuploidy)
   should be encouraged. The determination of susceptibility by analyzing
   genetic polymorphism, which is responsible for individual differences in
   the biotransformation of mutagens and carcinogens, will gain importance
   for risk assessment. Future research should include validating molecular
   methods, studying adaptive response to chemical carcinogens, and
   studying the modulatory effect of antioxidants, as well as the effect of
   carcinogens on immunity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some of the results from the Commission of the
   European Communities collaborative research program (contract number
   EV5V-CT92-0221), whose aim is to investigate the relationship between
   exposure to petroleum emissions, benzene, and induction of genetic
   damage in human cells. Twenty-four workers from petroleum plants in
   Poland and 35 unexposed controls were examined for cytogenetic effects
   and ras oncoprotein levels and their relationship to confounding factors
   (e.g., smoking habit, sex, family cancer history, and seasonal
   influence). Preliminary data of chromosome aberrations (CA) and sister
   chromatid exchanges (SCE) showed differences among sampling subgroups.
   In this present study, the levels of ras p21 proteins were determined
   and further analyses of CA, SCE, high frequency cells (HFC), and
   proliferative rate index (PRI) have been undertaken. Results show that
   the exposed group has statistically significant increases in CA, and
   percent of aberrant cells. There were no differences between exposed and
   unexposed groups in SCE, HFC, PRI, or the levels of ras p21 proteins.
   Smoking was found to statistically significantly affect levels of CA,
   percent of aberrant cells, SCE, HFC, and ras proteins. Sister chromatid
   exchanges were also statistically significantly sex dependent (7.5
   breaks/cell for females and 6.8 breaks/cell for males). There were no
   statistically significant differences for CA, percent aberrant cells,
   SCE, HFC, or ras p21 protein levels in subgroups characterized according
   to cancer cases reported in the immediate family. A seasonal variability
   was shown with statistically significant increases in various biomarkers
   in the winter. Unexposed groups also showed increases due to smoking and
   season. The nonsmoking group individuals also showed statistically
   significant increases in cytogenetic damage with exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Plant rhizosphere effects on atrazine degradation were examined in soil
   inoculated with an atrazine-mineralizing bacterial consortium. The
   consortium, consisting of three bacterial species, was isolated from an
   agricultural soil having previous long-term exposure to the herbicide.
   Atrazine mineralization and metabolite formation were monitored by
   measuring (CO2)-C-14 evolution from microcosms amended with radiolabeled
   atrazine and by HPLC of soil extracts. In noninoculated soil, ca. 11\%
   of C-14-chain-labeled atrazine was N-dealkylated, while only 2.4\% of
   the ring-labeled atrazine was mineralized after 5 weeks. Corn plants had
   no effect on atrazine mineralization or ethyl-side-chain N-dealkylation
   in noninoculated soils, but the formation of hydroxyatrazine was
   significantly enhanced in planted soil. Growth of corn in sterilized
   soil suggested that hydroxyatrazine formation was caused by plant
   metabolism of atrazine. introduction of the atrazine-mineralizing
   consortium into the soil significantly increased the rate of atrazine
   mineralization in comparison to noninoculated soil. After 4 weeks, 71\%
   of the atrazine was mineralized in nonplanted soil, whereas 84\% of the
   atrazine was mineralized in soil with corn plants. There was no
   significant difference in the rate of atrazine mineralization by the
   consortium in nonplanted and planted soil. However,
   atrazine-mineralizing populations at the end of the incubation were
   higher in the planted soil, which contained 8.1 x 10(4) degraders g(-1)
   of soil versus 2.7 x 10(3) degraders g(-1) in soil without plants. The
   results demonstrated that bioaugmentation with the atrazine-mineralizing
   consortium greatly enhanced the rate of atrazine mineralization.
   Long-term survival of the consortium and degradation of atrazine to
   hydroxyatrazine were both enhanced in rhizosphere soil, but corn
   seedlings had no significant effect on the rate of atrazine
   mineralization, either by the indigenous microflora or in soil
   inoculated with atrazine-mineralizing bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating toxicant effects on aquatic communities is difficult due to
   the ecological complexity at higher levels of organization. Two methods
   were assessed to improve the understanding of effects on
   macroinvertebrate communities in aquatic model ecosystems. First, in
   situ bioassay population effects were used to interpret effects at a
   higher organization level. Second, canonical discriminant analysis was
   used to investigate effects on community structure. In situ bioassays
   were conducted on six occasions in 17-m(3) microcosms treated with
   copper sulfate. Macroinvertebrates occurring naturally in the microcosms
   were monitored. Epibenthic in situ bioassays were conducted using Caenis
   sp. (Ephemeroptera) and Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda) and a water column
   bioassay was conducted using Notonectidae (Hemiptera). Survival and
   growth were assessed after 3 d. Effects of copper on both Notonectidae
   and Caenis were observed following application. However, the final
   Caenis epibenthic bioassays indicated that potential for recovery and
   survival was greater than or equal to 95\%. Potential for recovery was
   less distinct in the water column bioassays. Copper effects also

   Only four taxa, including Caenis, distinguished community differences
   among copper treatments soon after application. Later, communities
   showed similarities to the pretreatment bioassay. However, actual
   recovery was less apparent than the potential for recovery indicated by
   the bioassays, and community differences due to Caenis persisted.}},

Abstract = {{The nitrogen status of Gelidium latifolium on the north coast of Spain
   was monitored for a 2 year period from 1990 to 1991. Each summer, the
   population showed obvious symptoms of nitrogen (N) limitation, such as
   thallus `bleaching'. Minimum N content (as \% of dry weight), highest
   C/N ratio (above 45) and lowest protein (< 10\% dry weight) and
   phycobilin contents were observed during summer, when nitrate
   availability in seawater was lowest, and temperature and light levels
   were highest. However, tissue N content did not respond to a short local
   upwelling period that increased nitrate levels in seawater more than
   ten-fold. The effect of seawater N concentration and increased light
   levels on pigment content was established experimentally. N-starved
   plants placed in N-enriched seawater during summer 1990 showed increased
   levels of phycobilin and chlorophyll a compared with an unenriched
   control. Screens which transmitted different proportions of natural
   light placed over a Gelidium latifolium population during summer 1991
   resulted in a smaller reduction in both phycobilin and chlorophyll a
   contents. We conclude that N limitation in this population occurs as a
   response to increased irradiance and decreased seawater nitrate, typical
   of summer conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi, pea bacterial blight agent, is
   seed-transmitted. Some aspects of its life cycle and its biology were
   investigated. The colonization of pea plants obtained from naturally
   infected seeds Was studied in natural conditions while high populations
   of bacteria developed on plants showing no symptoms. Two
   streptomycin-resistant mutants were used to study the epiphytic life of
   the pathogen. Populations were monitored in different host-parasite
   compatibilities. When race 2 or race 6 of the pathogen was
   surface-inoculated on susceptible cultivars, a decrease of population
   size was observed during the following one to three days but was
   followed by an increase to levels 1000 times greater than the initial
   number detected, without symptoms for most of the plants. When race 2
   was surface-inoculated on resistant genotypes or race 6 on non-host
   plants, bacteria did not multiply but population levels slightly
   decreased. Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi shows a resident phase and its
   development is race-specific. Weeds collected in naturally contaminated
   pea fields, diseased or not, often harboured the pathogen but with
   levels smaller than those observed on peas. Pea crop debris and
   volunteers kept high levels of bacteria for at least eight months after
   the harvest of a diseased crop. As long as two pea crops are not grown
   one after the other in the same field, it is unlikely that debris and
   volunteers will act as an important inoculum source. The development of
   this pathogen during the growing season is considered as an important
   parameter to take into account for controlling the disease through seed
   health testing.}},

Abstract = {{Larval densities of the Douglas-fir tussock moth (Orgyia pseudotsugata
   {[}McDunnough] {[}Lepidoptera:Lymantriidae]) were monitored annually to
   construct population time series in five different forest ecosystems.
   The time series were generated in parts of five national forests in
   three geographical provinces: the northern Blue Mountains of
   northeastern Oregon, the southern Cascade Range of south-central Oregon,
   and the northern Cascade Range of north-central Washington. The five
   series ranged in length from 12 to 23 yr and represented the broad
   numerical behavior of tussock moth populations in those provinces. Time
   series with the most variable fluctuations were recorded in the Blue
   Mountains, a region with a long history of regular tussock moth
   outbreaks. The least variable series was in the southern Cascades, an
   area with no previously documented outbreaks. Characteristics of series
   in the Blue Mountains and the northern Cascades were significantly
   correlated with one another, but not with those of the series in the
   southern Cascades. The density-dependent structure of each time series
   was examined by autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions,
   which indicated that fluctuations were quasi-periodic, even at low
   densities, and that the most significant autoregressive process was a
   second-order feedback. Each time series was fit with a linear
   second-order autoregressive model and a discrete nonlinear logistic
   model with a single time delay. The models, based on density-dependent
   processes associated with preceding insect generations, accounted for an
   average of 44.6\% of the variation in the time series. The remaining
   55.4\% of variation was due to unknown density-independent factors
   related to different years in the series. The models showed that the
   principal dynamics of tussock moth populations are generated by direct
   and delayed density-dependent processes. In outbreak-prone ecosystems,
   like those in the Blue Mountains and the northern Cascades, the primary
   regulation of insect numbers is by delayed feedback processes that
   result in populations sometimes having extreme fluctuations in density.
   Conversely, in nonoutbreak ecosystems, as in the southern Cascades,
   feedback is more balanced between both direct and delayed processes that
   stabilize populations at lower densities. External factors, like
   weather, also may influence the numerical behavior of populations to
   some extent, but their specific contribution to tussock moth dynamics is
   largely unknown.}},

Abstract = {{With pristine tropical rainforest blanketing 80 percent of its terrain,
   Suriname is among the world's most heavily forested countries. But now
   that the country is on the brink of economic collapse, it is under
   enormous pressure to restructure its economy and heal the wounds of
   twelve years of civil unrest. Poor, bereft of foreign currency reserves,
   suffering 500-percent annual inflation and high unemployment, Suriname
   is desperately resisting foreign advice to implement structural
   adjustment. to attract investment, the government is poised to award
   forest concessions covering one fourth of the nation's territory to
   Asian timber barons whose records in Malaysia and Indonesia do not
   inspire confidence.
   Unless Suriname revises its current plans, it will forego tens of
   millions of dollars in annual revenues -up to 10 percent of gross
   domestic product - through poorly negotiated logging contracts under
   which it essentially gives away its forests while getting shattered
   biodiversity, ruined fisheries, eroded soil, displaced populations, and
   perhaps ethnic strife in return. The draft concession contracts have
   already been submitted to Parliament, but Suriname still has the option
   of revising the contracts and changing various policies to forestall
   economic, social and environmental damages.
   The author recommends pragmatic ways that the Government of Suriname
   could improve concession policy. If it changed the way that forestry
   concessions are awarded, taxed, and enforced, the government could
   prevent the worst environmental damage and reap more revenue to deal
   with its most pressing social and economic problems. Specifically, the
   author proposes that the government auction off concessions after
   establishing minimum bids and making sure that prospective bidders have
   good track record in other countries, in addition to levying value-added
   taxes on timber and processed wood products.
   To curb negative social impacts and create better jobs, the government
   can launch a program to protect communal lands, sharing information with
   forest communities on pending development proposals, and requiring
   social impact assessments for concessions within or bordering on
   communal lands. Establishing a program to continuously monitor forest
   concessionaires' performance would help ensure compliance with contract
   provisions. Requiring that concessionaires and wood-processing
   industries meet minimum employment standards and integrate training and
   apprenticeship programs into their business plans could bolster social
   progress. Government could also help ensure that concession workers have
   the right to join labor unions.
   Finally, everyone with a stake in the forests must be represented in
   decision-making circles if concession agreements are to reflect their
   rights and interests. Suriname has already established a set of councils
   designed to give people in the hinterland a say in decisions that will
   profoundly affect their lives, but the nation has been unable to
   implement them because of budget constraints. Supporting these
   participatory mechanisms should be a key part of any international
   assistance package.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal changes in feeding and growth of immature (1+), maturing male
   (1+), and mature male and female (3+) Arctic charr were studied by
   monitoring feed intake and growth of individually-marked fish for over 1
   year. The fish were held at a constant temperature (4 degrees C) under
   conditions of liberal feed supply. Feed intake and growth remained low
   in the period December-April, with only 20-60\% of the fish having fed
   on each occasion that feed intake was monitored. Feed intake and growth
   increased markedly during the late spring and summer, but the increases
   were delayed by approximately 1-2 months in the immature fish compared
   with their maturing counterparts. Maturing fish decreased feeding during
   the late summer and by September there had been an almost complete
   cessation of feeding. This was reflected in changes in fish body weight
   and condition, both of which declined from August-September onwards. By
   contrast, the immature fish peaked in weight and condition in September,
   and weight loss during the autumn tended to be less rapid than observed
   for the maturing fish. The fish appeared to reduce feeding once a
   `threshold condition' of 1.4-1.5 had been attained. It is suggested that
   the fish may become anorexic once there has been replenishment of the
   energy reserves required for overwintering and, in the case of maturing
   individuals, for the completion of gonadal growth and spawning. (C) 1996

Abstract = {{A series of genomic DNA probes which exhibit specificity for Beauveria
   bassiana demonstrated a level of sensitivity to approximately 152 ng of
   fungal DNA (Hegedus and Khachatourians, 1993a). To improve the
   sensitivity of a DNA-based monitoring system for detection of this
   entomopathogenic fungus we have developed a PCR-based method. Using
   sequence information from a region of the B. bassiana-specific probe
   pBb22, primers P1 (5'AAGCTTCGACATGGTCTG) and P3 (5'GGAGGTGGTGAGGTTCTGTT)
   were generated. This primer set amplified similar-sized products from
   several B. bassiana isolates, Beauveria brongniartii, Beauveria
   caledonica, and B. densa, but not Tolypocladium nivea, Tolypocladium
   cylindrospora, Metarhizium anisopliae, Verticillium lecanii, and
   Paecilomyces farinosus or migratory grasshoppers and locusts.
   Hybridization with the probe indicated the presence of DNA homology
   between the products. Restriction enzyme analysis of the PCR products,
   however, showed that sequence heterogeneity existed which was confirmed
   by partial sequencing of the products. Another primer, P5
   (5'AGGAGAGAGCTCGACGGTCA), was developed to exploit the sequence
   variations. When the P1-P5 primer set was used, a product was amplified
   from most B. bassiana isolates, including two which failed to amplify
   with the P1-P3 set. This amplification was not observed with the other
   Beauveria species tested. The nature of the sequence variations within
   the P1-P3 PCR-amplified region suggests the placement of B. densa and B.
   caledonica outside the species B. bassiana, confirming previous evidence
   with mitochondrial DNA and DNA probes. PCR with the P1-P3 and P1-P5
   primer sets was used to discriminate isolates of B. bassiana found to be
   infecting a population of the migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus
   sanguinipes, collected in Saskatchewan. The PCR products derived from
   the P1-P3 primer set with the various Beauveria spp. could be
   differentiated by single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP). Thus,
   analysis of PCR products using restriction enzymes, sequencing, or SSCPs
   allows positive differentiation of a particular B. bassiana isolate from
   others. The great sensitivity of these techniques should help the
   release and monitoring of entomopathogenic fungi in the environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were monitored
   for 3 years (1986-1988) in late and early successional habitats.
   Late-successional habitats consisted of mature hardwood forests with
   little herbaceous vegetation. Early successional habitats were induced
   by treatment with either triclopyr or tebuthiuron herbicides, used with
   and without annual prescribed burning, and consisted of varying levels
   of shrubs and herbaceous vegetation. Abundance of white-footed mice was
   highest in 1986 and declined through 1987 and 1988, which corresponded
   to declines in biomass of forbs. Abundance was higher on both herbicide
   treatments than controls and higher on triclopyr than tebuthiuron
   treatments. Triclopyr-altered habitats provided a mixture of dense
   shrubs and forbs not found in tebuthiuron-altered sites. Litter size,
   but not reproductive activity, was higher on triclopyr compared to
   tebuthiuron treatments in spring 1986. Body condition of adult mice, but
   not body mass, was higher on herbicide and burned treatments than on
   controls and unburned treatments, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Diet and abundance of San Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis mutica)
   were monitored over 45 months (1989-1992) at a semi-arid site in
   southcentral California. From 1990 to early 1991, the mammalian prey of
   these endangered foxes declined markedly to densities 2-5X lower than at
   peak. During late 1991 and 1992, however, the populations of at least
   three species of mammalian prey irrupted. Regardless of these
   fluctuations, foxes maintained consistent preferences among small
   mammals, and did not shift their diets to other prey when mammalian prey
   was scarce. Although we did not detect a clear functional response,
   foxes did respond numerically because their abundance decreased after
   the decline in mammalian prey. This decline in abundance was due to
   proportionately fewer females successfully rearing young and high
   coyote-induced mortality, rather than foxes abandoning their
   territories. Because kit foxes continue to prey on their staple species
   during times of prey scarcity, declines in rates of consumption could
   exert a strong influence on the population dynamics of this endangered
   fox. We suggest that population dynamics of kit foxes may be similar to
   those of obligate predators due to their apparent unwillingness or
   inability to switch to abundant, alternate prey during declines in
   density of their preferred prey.}},

Abstract = {{Whole-kernel corn was treated with 10 mg ivermectin per 0.45 kg corn and
   fed at a rate of approximate to 0.45 kg/deer per day to white-tailed
   deer confined in the treatment pasture, whereas deer in an adjacent
   control pasture received a similar ration of untreated corn. Treatments
   were dispensed from February through September of 1992, and 1993, and
   free-living populations of lone star ticks, Amblyomma americanum (L.),
   were monitored in both pastures using dry-ice traps to quantify nymphs
   and adults and flip-cloths to assay the relative abundance of larval
   masses Control values that were calculated for all ticks collected in
   both pastures during 1993 showed 83.4\% fewer adults, 92.4\% fewer
   nymphs, and 100.0\% fewer larval masses in the treatment versus control
   pasture. Serum ivermectin concentrations in treated deer averaged 21.7
   and 28.3 ppb during 1992 and 1993, respectively. These values compared
   favorably with the goal concentration of 30.0 ppb which was anticipated
   under ideal conditions. This study demonstrates that a freely consumed,
   systemicaily active acaricidal bait ingested by white-tailed deer under
   nearly wild conditions can significantly reduce the abundance of all
   stages of free-living lone star ticks.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate effects of persistent bot fly (Alouattamyia baeri)
   parasitism on a host population of Panamanian howler monkeys (Alouatta
   palliata), a 68-month study was carried out which included: (i)
   examination of the parasite's life cycle; (ii) monthly estimates of
   prevalence and mean intensity; (iii) monitoring of howler mortality;
   (iv) censuses of howler monkey troops; and (v) analysis of blood samples
   from infected and uninfected monkeys. A complete life cycle of A. baeri
   takes approximately 13 weeks; larvae remain in howlers for approximately
   six weeks, passing through three instars. Overall prevalence of
   infection was 60\%, overall mean intensity 2.8 +/- 0.04. No difference
   in prevalence or mean intensity was found between adult males and
   Females. As a class, juveniles had a significantly higher prevalence and
   a significantly lower mean intensity than adults; the adult and juvenile
   classes both showed a significantly higher prevalence and mean intensity
   than the infant class. Such differences may relate to characteristics of
   younger age classes rather than host selectivity on the part of the
   parasite. Although larvae were observed in the howler population
   throughout the year, relative density fluctuated from month to month,
   showing from one to three significant peaks per year. Larvae were most
   abundant during the mid-to-late rainy Season (Aug.-Nov.). Relative
   density was strongly correlated with howler mortality. Several
   hematological parameters including serum albumin levels and
   albumin/globulin ratio were significantly lower in individuals with
   heavy larval burdens. No endoparasites or diseases were found in blood
   samples. I conclude that the annual pattern of howler mortality results
   from a synergistic effect between the age, physical condition, and fat
   reserves of parasitized individuals, the size of the larval burden, and
   increasing dietary stress as the rainy season progresses. The lack of
   growth in this closed primate population over >20 years apparently
   results, in large part, from primary and secondary effects of bot fly
   parasitism.}},

Abstract = {{Positive correlation between the number of shells or skeletal elements
   of a species preserved in the sedimentary record and the abundance and
   distribution of the once-living population can be an important
   assumption in paleoecological analysis. The assumption was tested for
   the large gastropod Strombus gigas (queen conch) in and around 2 nursery
   grounds in the central Bahamas. Concentrations of shell fragments on the
   surface of the sediment measured in 1990 were closely correlated (r =
   0.998 and 0.928) with mean live conch abundance monitored regularly at
   13 stations during the 2 previous years. Projections from field
   experiments on shell decomposition rates indicated that the shell
   remains of S. gigas last for at least a decade on the sediment surface.
   The direct relationship between shell remains and living populations
   integrated over time permits interpretation of historic changes in
   populations. Furthermore, time-averaging qualities of the death
   assemblages provide an integration of distribution and abundance
   patterns on an ecological time scale useful in learning the
   relationships between the environment, the species and its management.}},

Abstract = {{Many factors have been shown to affect rhizobial populations in soil.
   These include: soil fertility; physical properties such as pH and clay
   content; biotic factors such as distribution of the host plant and the
   prevalence of predators; and climatic effects including temperature and
   rainfall. Extremes of soil pH, temperature and moisture are not
   favourable to rhizobia. In certain circumstances, some rhizobial species
   seem to survive as part of the saprophytic soil microflora, whereas
   others cannot be detected unless their leguminous plant host is present.
   There hale been numerous reports over the past century on factors which
   influence rhizobial survival, reflecting the importance of rhizobial
   inoculants in agriculture. Many of these results appear to be
   contradictory, presumably because of the complexity of the interactions
   between different influences, which this review of the literature
   attempts to clarify. Results from monitoring population dynamics of
   different rhizobial species and biovars under various crops at
   Rothamsted demonstrate that populations of Rhizobium leguminosarum
   biovars survive in the absence of their host plants at c. 10(4)-10(5)
   nodulating cells g(-1) soil, and increase only about threefold following
   cultivation of the host. In contrast, Sinorhizobium meliloti could not
   be detested before its host was grown, but increased to 10(6) nodulating
   cells g(-1) soil when lucerne was cultivated. The behaviour of a
   genetically modified R. leguminosarum bv, viciae strain, RSM2004,
   following held release as an inoculant, was similar to that of the:
   indigenous population, numbers remaining stable in the absence of the
   host following an initial decline, with a small but significant
   numerical advantage bring conferred by the presence of the host in the
   subsequent Sears. A second genetically modified R, leguminosarum by.
   viciae inoculant, CT0370, was found to survive in numbers similar to
   those of the indigenous population.}},

Abstract = {{Ephemeral rain pools contain diverse assemblages of protists and small
   metazoans. Rain pool organisms survive periods of desiccation as dormant
   cysts or resting stages, and become active shortly after the pools fill
   with water. Non-equilibrium mechanisms related to the frequent drying of
   pools could promote the observed coexistence of over 15 species of
   ecologically similar microorganisms. We used dormant organisms from the
   substrate of a well-characterized ephemeral pool to create 20 microcosms
   that experienced two different disturbance regimes. Undisturbed
   microcosms held a constant volume of medium over the entire 30-d study
   period. Disturbed microcosms dried periodically, at approximately five-d
   intervals, and were then refilled with medium to initiate new rounds of
   community development. Daily monitoring of the presence or absence of
   active organisms provided information about the number and identity of
   species in disturbed and undisturbed microcosms. Undisturbed microcosms
   contained a greater number of active species, primarily because some
   predatory species only became active after at least five to ten d of
   uninterrupted community development. Species composition diverged
   rapidly after the first drying episode as communities in undisturbed and
   disturbed microcosms developed along different successional
   trajectories. If non-equilibrium mechanisms contribute to diversity in
   this system, their contribution must occur over more episodes of
   disturbance than we observed.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence and distribution of A1 and A2 mating types of Phytophthora
   infestans in Canada and of metalaxyl-sensitive (MS) and -insensitive
   (MI) strains were monitored during 1993, 1994, and 1995. Diseased leaves
   from about 1,600 plants were collected from 36 cultivars in 168 potato
   fields from five provinces at various times (June to September) during
   the growing season. The most extensive sampling (88\% of total) was
   conducted in British Columbia (B.C.). About 500 isolates of P. infestans
   were characterized from over 1,000 collected. In 1993, the A1 mating
   type was found in all provinces sampled, while western Canada (B.C.) was
   the only region in which the A2 mating type was detected. In 1994, the
   A2 mating type was also found in eastern Canada (New Brunswick
   {[}N.B.]). In B.C., 23 fields sampled in 1993 had both A1 and A2 mating
   types, while in N.B. in 1994, both mating types originated from the same
   plant in seven different fields. When lesions from two of these fields
   were examined by microscope, sporangia of P. infestans and a single
   oospore were seen in leaf tissues, demonstrating the potential for
   oospore production in naturally infected leaves in western and eastern
   Canada if both mating types are present. Metalaxyl sensitivity tests
   measuring relative growth of isolates with metalaxyl at 0 and 50 mu g/ml
   revealed that all isolates collected in 1993 from Alberta, Manitoba,
   N.B., Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec were MS. In
   B.C., isolates showed a range of variation in growth with and without
   metalaxyl, and 76\% of the isolates were MI. There was no correlation
   between recovery of these MI strains and use or nonuse of metalaxyl
   during the same growing season. Both MS and MI strains were present
   together in six fields. A low frequency of MS strains of both mating
   types was always recovered in B.C. When the frequency of occurrence of
   MS and MI strains throughout the growing season was examined, a high
   proportion of isolates collected early (June to July) from B.C. and N.B.
   in 1993 and 1994 was found to be MI. At the end of the season
   (September), MI isolates also occurred at a higher frequency in both
   locations and years. When the frequency of mating types was examined,
   the A2 type occurred at a higher proportion throughout the season in
   B.C. during 1993 acid 1994. However, in 1995, the A2 mating type was
   rarely recovered and the A1 type predominated. In N.B. in 1994, the A1
   mating type was recovered at a higher frequency than the A2 type in
   July, but most collections later were of mixed mating type. When the
   isolates were grouped into A1, A2, MS, and MI categories and growth
   rates were compared, isolates from populations in B.C. and N.B. in 1994
   of A2 mating type grew significantly faster than A1; isolates that were
   MI from populations in B.C. in 1993 grew significantly faster than MS
   isolates. However, no differences could be detected in the extent of
   leaf colonization or sporulation between isolates representing A1, A2,
   MS, or MI. A preliminary survival study showed that P. infestans could
   overwinter under B.C. conditions on artificially inoculated tubers.
   These results illustrate the dynamic nature of populations of P.
   infestans within and between growing seasons in western and eastern
   Canada, and demonstrate higher variation in the population in B.C.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical procedure has been developed to quantify the mortality
   response of caged macroinvertebrates in terms of measured environmental
   parameters. Populations of Gammarus pulex and Asellus aquaticus were
   caged in urban receiving waters downstream of a combined sewer overflow
   (CSO) and a surface water outfall (SWO) for 36 d. During this period of
   exposure, the mortality and heavy metal bioaccumulation responses of
   populations of both species, as well as seventeen different chemical and
   hydrological characteristics of the receiving watercourse were
   monitored. Multivariate statistical techniques, comprising principal
   component analysis (with VARIMAX rotation) and multiple regression
   analysis were used to determine the measured variables that influenced
   mortality. Certain parameters (BOD5, total aqueous copper concentration,
   flow rate and suspended solids) influenced the mortality responses of
   both species. Ammonia, total aqueous lead concentrations and dissolved
   aqueous concentrations of zinc and copper additionally affected the
   response of Gammarus pulex. Body concentrations of zinc, lead, cadmium
   and copper and dissolved aqueous concentrations of cadmium were found to
   be influential upon the mortality response of caged Asellus aquaticus.
   The relationships between the mortality responses of each species and
   the selected independent variables are expressed in the form of stable
   quantitative equations by regressing the dependent variable (ie
   mortality) against the principal components of the independent
   parameters. This statistical approach represents an important tool for
   interpreting large intercorrelated sets of environmental data obtained
   in situ. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to assess the ability of three methods,
   alkaline elution (AE), nick translation (NT), and single-cell gel
   electrophoresis (SCGE), to detect DNA single-strand breaks (ssb) in
   human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HPBL) exposed in vitro to three
   geno-toxic agents: gamma-rays, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and
   benzo{[}a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE). The ultimate objective is to
   select the most feasible, sensitive, and reproducible method for the
   monitoring of populations exposed to genotoxic agents. AE and NT do not
   seem suitable assays. AE is able to detect DNA lesions induced by the
   three compounds, but only at relatively high doses (2 Gy, 5 mM EMS and
   20 mu M BPDE). With NT, DNA alterations induced by gamma-rays are not
   detected and ssb are only evidenced after exposure to EMS (80 mM), which
   already alters the viability of the lymphocytes. Nick translation is
   able to detect ssb induced by 10 mu M BPDE. Compared to the other
   assays, the sensitivity or the SCGE assay is significantly higher since
   statistically significant changes were detected after incubation with
   0.5 mM EMS and 1.25 mu M BDPE. SCGE is a relatively simple method, not
   time-consuming and applicable to a large number of samples per working
   day. In conclusion, on the basis of the results oi this in vitro
   comparison, SCGE seems a promising method for the monitoring of
   populations exposed to genotoxic chemicals.}},

   exhibit biennial fluctuation in berry production but individual plants
   retained the same rank among other plants in the number of viable seeds
   produced per berry from year to year. No significant correlation was
   found between berry production and precipitation or temperature. Two
   plants produced about 27\% of the total seed output of this population
   sample while the ten poorest producers contributed <1\% of the total
   seed output. No recruitment was observed, nevertheless recruitment from
   either direct germination or from a small but persistent seed bank is

Abstract = {{Single artificial nest boxes have frequently been used to monitor
   populations of Peromyscus leucopus. We monitored four boxes at each of
   20 stations to determine patterns of use of multiple boxes at a station
   for a population of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus
   noveboracensis). Some litters were divided between adjacent boxes at a
   station (8\% of observations in the breeding and postbreeding seasons)
   and darns sometimes nested in a box adjacent to their litter (14\% of
   observations in the breeding season; 11\% of observations in the
   postbreeding season). Our results suggest that multiple nest boxes per
   station may aid in the determination of litter maternity and
   composition, and may permit more accurate sampling of the study
   population than single boxes.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive areas of spruce forest were affected by an outbreak of the
   Scolytid beetle Ips typographus all over Southern Bavaria between 1990
   and `95. During this gradation young beetles were collected from bark
   samples and examined with regard to the male to female sex ratio. It
   turned out that there is a significant interaction between gradation
   phase and sex ratio. An increase of population density was accompanied
   by an increasing portion of female beetles, up to 72\%. A decrease of
   the females to an equal index of 50:50 indicated the breakdown of mass
   propagation. This experiences could be used as an indicator of gradation
   phase and thus to create a new method of monitoring gradations of spruce
   bark beetle. The regulation mechanisms responsible for this deviation
   from a genetically plausible index of 1:1 can take influence as at the
   time of fertilisation as at embryonal or postembryonal development of
   the beetles. Parthenogenetic reproduction was not found in I.

Abstract = {{Temporal and spatial changes in the population of Aulacoseira granulata,
   the dominant alga within the Murray River (south-eastern Australia), are
   described utilizing weekly data (1980-1992) from the algal, water
   quality and flow monitoring programs of the Murray-Darling Basin
   Commission. The population dynamics of A. granulata are related to flow
   conditions, turbidity and silica concentrations. Diatoms (A. granulata
   and other centric species) were the most abundant algae during the 12
   years of phytoplankton record for the upper and central reaches of the
   Murray River, with A. granulata occurring at up to 77,700 cells/ml. In
   the slower flowing, lower reaches of the river, centric diatoms other
   than A. granulata occurred most frequently, followed by Scenedesmus
   spp., while A. granulata occurred intermittently at high densities.
   Turbidity values within the river generally ranged from 5-80 NTU
   (maximum value 470 NTU). Silica concentrations were generally 2-6 mg/l
   (maximum value 44.5 mg/l), but values less than 0.1 mg/l were not
   uncommon. The population dynamics of A. granulata were most strongly
   related to flow and silica concentration. In the upper half of the
   river, cell densities were reduced dramatically by floods or silica
   depletion but a substantial population was usually present under median
   discharge conditions, on some occasions when the silica concentration
   was less than 0.1 mg/l. A. granulata was less prevalent in the more
   slowly flowing lower parts of the river (the lower Murray is controlled
   by a lock and weir system), reaching high cell densities for short
   periods only when flow conditions provided sufficient turbulence, and
   never exhausting the supply of silica. The higher turbidities found in
   the lower parts of the river (median values around 60 NTU) appeared to
   impact significantly on cell densities only when above 100 NTU. The
   findings are discussed in relation to the known meroplanktonic lifestyle
   of A. granulata.}},

Abstract = {{We followed the fate of mapped sporophytes of Botrychium paradoxum,
   Botrychium hesperium, and their hybrid Botrychium x watertonense in
   permanent plots for 6 years in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta.
   All three species had half-lives of approximately 3 years or less.
   Botrychium paradoxum had higher rates of recruitment and mortality
   leading to less stable population sizes than B. hesperium, perhaps
   contributing to the former's relative rarity. All species demonstrated
   prolonged dormancy whereby plants remain below ground for 1 or more
   years before reappearing. Surveys and monitoring studies for these and
   probably other species of Botrychium are more difficult owing to
   prolonged dormancy. Short lifespan and association with disturbed
   habitats suggests that these ferns may require natural disturbance
   regimes for long-term persistence.}},

Abstract = {{I tagged and monitored Vancouver Island marmots (Marmota vancouverensis)
   to investigate demographic trends among colonies inhabiting natural
   subalpine meadows and recently logged habitats. Marmota vancouverensis
   exhibits low reproductive rates, with litter sizes of 2-5 ((x) over bar
   = 3.36, SD = 0.83, n = 36). Females are capable of breeding at age 3,
   but most animals did not breed until age 4 ((x) over bar = 4.00 years,
   SD = 0.82 years, n = 13), and displayed a nonreproductive interval of at
   least 1 year between litters ((x) over bar = 1.83 years, SD = 0.76
   years, n = 6). Persistence of marmots was higher at natural sites than
   in logged areas (65 versus 48\%). Maximum female age was 9 years in
   natural habitats and 5 years in clearcuts. No adult female inhabiting a
   clearcut (n = 14) produced more than a single litter, while 5 of 14
   females in natural habitats produced 11 litters. The net reproductive
   value of colonies in clearcut habitats was less than half that of
   natural colonies (0.25 versus 0.72). Recently logged habitats may act as
   a demographic `'sink'' by consuming more dispersers than they produce,
   and therefore impede the recolonization of distant natural habitats.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{328-337}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As the human population grows and natural resources decline, there is
   pressure to apply increasing levels of top-down, command-and-control
   management to natural resources. This is manifested in attempts to
   control ecosystems and in socioeconomic institutions that respond to
   erratic or surprising ecosystem behavior with more control. Command and
   control, however, usually results in unforeseen consequences for both
   natural ecosystems and human welfare in the form of collapsing
   resources, social and economic strife, and losses of biological
   diversity. We describe the `'pathology of natural resource management,''
   defined as a loss of system resilience when the range of natural
   variation in the system is reduced encapsulates the unsustainable
   environmental, social, and economic outcomes of command-and-control
   resource management. If natural levels of variation in system behavior
   are reduced through command-and-control, then the system becomes less
   resilient to external perturbations, resulting in crises and surprises.
   We provide several examples of this pathology in management. An ultimate
   pathology emerges when resource management agencies, through initial
   success with command and control, lose sight of their original purposes,
   eliminate research and monitoring, and focus on efficiency of control.
   They then become isolated from the managed systems and inflexible in
   structure. Simultaneously, through overcapitalization, society becomes
   dependent upon command and control, demands it in greater intensity, and
   ignores the underlying ecological change or collapse that is developing.
   Solutions to this pathology cannot come from further command and control
   (regulations) but must come from innovative approaches involving
   incentives leading to more resilient ecosystems, more flexible agencies,
   more self-reliant industries, and a more knowledgeable citizenry. We
   discuss several aspects of ecosystem pattern and dynamics at large
   scales that provide insight into ecosystem resilience, and we propose a
   `'Golden Rule'' of natural resource management that we believe is
   necessary for sustainability: management should strive to retain
   critical types and ranges of natural variation in resource systems in
   order to maintain their resiliency.}},

Abstract = {{The largest known breeding migration of the flatwoods salamander
   (Ambystoma cingulatum) was monitored over a 22-year period following its
   discovery in 1970 in Liberty County, Florida (U.S.A). Nightly migrations
   of 200-300 adults across a 4.3-km stretch of paved highway in 1970-1972
   had dwindled to less than one individual per night in 1990-1992; the
   decline apparently was already underway in the 1980s. We discuss
   possible natural and anthropogenic causes of the decline. The
   silvicultural practice of converting native longleaf pine savanna to
   bedded slash pine plantation, implemented on our study site about 1968,
   may have interfered with migration, successful hatching, larval life,
   feeding, and finding suitable cover post-metamorphosis. Longleaf
   pine-wiregrass flatwoods inhabited by adults have been drastically
   reduced and severely degraded throughout the coastal plain and may
   explain why the species is rare and deserving of threatened status.}},

Title = {{Interspecific competition controls abundance and habitat use of
   territorial Caribbean damselfishes}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{885-899}},

Abstract = {{The prevailing notion that interspecific competition has little impact
   on the abundances of tropica!reef fishes has been tested by few
   experiments, all of which examined its effects on recruitment and
   juvenile demography rather than on adult abundances. This study, in
   Caribbean Panama, examined whether a common territorial damselfish,
   Stegastes planifrons, limits the abundances of adults of four
   ecologically similar congeners in S. planifrons' primary habitat: S.
   partitus and S. variabilis, which commonly occur in that habitat, and S.
   diencaeus and S. leucostictus, which rarely do.
   When S. planifrons was nearly eliminated from 16 natural patch reefs for
   4-6 yr, adult populations of S. partitus, which is less aggressive and
   half the size of S. planifrons, doubled and expanded their range into a
   microhabitat previously used almost exclusively by adults of S.
   planifrons. Population increases by S. partitus occurred within 1 yr of
   the removal of S. planifrons, were persistent, but only reached their
   maximum approximate to 4 yr (and about four generations) after the
   initial removal. Adult populations of S. variabilis, which is less
   aggressive and 20\% smaller than S. planifrons, also doubled following
   the removal of S. planifrons. Combined populations of S. partitus plus
   S. variabilis increased most on reefs where S. planifrons previously had
   been most dense. However, increases by those two species reached only
   approximate to 70\% of the population density and approximate to 40\% of
   the biomass density that S. planifrons had before the removals. Removal
   of S. planifrons had no effect on the abundances of S. diencaeus and S.
   leucostictus. Removal of S. partitus from eight reefs for 3 yr did not
   affect the abundances of S. planifrons or S. variabilis.
   Eleven years monitoring of adult populations and juvenile recruitment by
   S. partitus before and during the experiment show that its population
   increase after the removal of S. planifrons occurred while its overall
   abundance was gradually increasing, but was not associated with a period
   of unusually high juvenile recruitment.
   Thus asymmetric competition among closely related, ecologically similar,
   territorial coral reef fishes does sometimes control both abundances and
   microhabitat use in shared habitat. Interspecific territoriality and
   differences in body size and aggressiveness that lead to asymmetric
   competitive ability occur commonly among reef fishes in various trophic
   groups. Interspecific interactions within such groups of species often
   affect their patterns of habitat use. Hence the role that interspecific
   competition plays in limiting abundances of coral reef fishes requires
   reevaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of lindane on natural planktonic communities were investigated
   in aquatic indoor microcosms. Lindane was dosed to eight 300-liter
   microcosms for 2 weeks, and effects and recovery processes were
   monitored over 12 weeks. Mean measured water concentrations of lindane
   during the exposure period were 3, 6, 13, 27, 55, 102, 230, and 455 mu
   g/liter. Zooplankton was severely affected by lindane. The most
   sensitive organisms were nauplii of copepodes which were affected at all
   treatment levels greater than or equal to 6 mu g/liter during exposure
   (Days 2-14). Recovery of nauplii abundance was concentration-dependent
   at concentrations less than or equal to 55 mu g/liter lindane, whereas
   at concentrations greater than or equal to 102 mu g/liter recovery was
   negligible, Cladocera abundance decreased during exposure to greater
   than or equal to 102 mu g/liter lindane and did not recover to original
   levels until the end of the study, For phytoplankton, decreased
   population densities of Chlorophyceae and microalgae(<5 mu m) were
   observed at lindane concentrations less than or equal to 55 mu g/liter,
   where zooplankton was only temporarily affected, At higher lindane
   concentrations (greater than or equal to 102 mu g/liter) effects on
   phytoplankton were not clear, as also increases in abundances were
   observed, probably as a consequence of minimized grazing pressure, due
   to high zooplankton mortality. Comparison of these results with data
   obtained in complex outdoor systems demonstrates the practicability and
   sensitivity of indoor microcosms and emphasizes the importance of
   long-term testing and assessment of recovery processes for prediction of
   environmental effects. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the effects of handling and confinement stress and
   a 3-day recovery period on a number of biochemical parameters used to
   monitor exposure of fish to bleached kraft mill effluent (BKME), Plasma
   was collected at four times of the day from male and female white sucker
   subjected to four levels of handling stress during their spawning
   migration at a BKME and a reference site. Indicators of a general
   response to stress (plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, and total
   protein) and of reproductive fitness (plasma testosterone,
   11-ketotestosterone, and 17 beta-estradiol) were measured. With the
   exception of 17 beta-estradiol in females, all of the parameters
   measured varied with time of day and stress level, The general stress
   indicators ranged from being highly to marginally responsive to handling
   and confinement stress and were inconsistent in terms of indicating a
   site difference. The reproductive steroids were moderately responsive to
   stress and gave the most consistent site difference with testosterone
   and 11-ketotestosterone levels reduced in BKME-exposed fish under low
   levels of stress. There was limited evidence for recovery from capture,
   handling, and transport in the spring for plasma cortisol, lactate, and
   17 beta-estradiol at the BKME site, plasma glucose at the reference
   site, and plasma testosterone at both sites, Fish were also more
   responsive to an additional acute stress on Day 1 and Day 3 of recovery
   compared to that on Day 0, This study emphasizes the need for
   standardized methods in field collections and sampling with the least
   amount of stress possible, and suggests that holding white sucker for 1
   or 3 days does not allow them to recover from the stress of capture. (C)

Abstract = {{Pupal mortality in the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), caused by
   invertebrate natural enemies and other factors was monitored at
   Belleplain State Forest in southern New Jersey from 1983 to 1991. Two
   methods were used, laboratory rearings of intact pupae field collected
   during metamorphosis and postseason examination of pupal remains. The
   introduced chalcidid Brachymeria intermedia (Nees) consistently
   destroyed higher percentages of male gypsy moth pupae than female pupae.
   Ichneumonid parasitism was sometimes higher in male pupae than female
   pupae. Diptera, mostly Tachinidae and Sarcophagidae, were more likely to
   emerge from female than male intact pupae, but in the case of pupal
   remains, emergence from each sex was variable, being significantly
   higher in male pupae than female pupae for 2 yr, but the reverse in
   another year. Sex-based bias in predation of gypsy moth pupae by
   invertebrates, primarily larvae of Calosoma sycophanta (L.), was
   observed only in 2 yr, when it was slightly higher in male pupae.
   Incidence of disease was higher in female pupae than male pupae, but
   desiccation was more likely to occur in male pupae than female pupae.
   Based on examination of pupal remains, survival of female and male pupae
   averaged 53.0 and 45.5\%, respectively, with marked differences observed
   in 5 of 9 yr of the study. Because of the sex-based bias in mortality by
   some invertebrate natural enemies, sex ratios (expressed as percentage
   of females) of gypsy moth adults were sometimes much higher than pupae.
   This bias was most noticeable during the outbreak aid decline phases of
   the gypsy moth population cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The Agricultural Health Study, a large prospective cohort study, has
   been initiated in North Carolina and Iowa. The objectives of this study
   are to: 1) identify and quantify cancer risks among men, women, whites,
   and minorities associated with direct exposure to pesticides and other
   agricultural agents; 2) evaluate noncancer heath risks including
   neurotoxicity, reproductive effects, immunologic effects, nonmalignant
   respiratory disease, kidney disease, and growth and development among
   children; 3) evaluate disease risks among spouses and children of
   farmers that may arise from direct contact with pesticides and
   agricultural chemicals used in the home, lawns and gardens, and from
   indirect contact, such as spray drift, laundering work clothes, or
   contaminated food or water; 4) assess current and past occupational and
   nonoccupational agricultural exposures using periodic interviews and
   environmental and biologic monitoring, 5) study the relationship between
   agricultural exposures, biomarkers of exposure, biologic effect, and
   genetic susceptibility factors relevant to carcinogenesis; and 6)
   identify and quantify cancer and other disease risks associated with
   lifestyle factors such as diet, cooking practices, physical activity,
   smoking and alcohol consumption, and hair dye use. In the first year of
   a 3-year enrollment period, 26,235 people have been enrolled in the
   study including 19,776 registered pesticide applicators and 6,459
   spouses of registered farmer applicators. It is estimated that when the
   total cohort is assembled in 1997 it will include approximately 75,000
   adult study subjects. Farmers, the largest group of registered pesticide
   applicators, comprise 77\% of the target population enrolled in the
   study. This experience compares favorably with enrollment rates of
   previous prospective studies.}},

Abstract = {{The California Air Resources Board conducted ambient air monitoring of
   pesticides in support of the California Department of Pesticide
   Regulation toxic air contaminant program. Monitoring was done in several
   communities in a county of high use during the month of expected peak
   use of a particular pesticide in order to assess general population
   exposure. Additional sampling was conducted adjacent to snecific
   agricultural applications to assess maximum short-term concentrations to
   which the public might be exposed. Medium and low volume samplers were
   used with appropriate collection media (e.g., Teflon filters, XAD-2
   adsorbent resin), followed by laboratory analysis, Concentrations
   measured around specific applications would be expected to be
   representative of other areas, especially in California, with comparable
   application rates, crops, and weather conditions. Since the program
   began in 1986, monitoring has been conducted for 22 pesticides. Results
   for three soil fumigants were of potential public health concern and led
   to the suspension of permits for the use of one pesticide and were used
   in the development of use modifications and buffer zones for two others.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical registrations under FIFRA (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
   Rodenticide Act) and TSCA (Toxic Substance Control Act) in the United
   States, and equivalent regulations in Canada and Europe, are driven
   extensively by risk assessments. Chemicals intended for use as
   pesticides are evaluated by considering fate and transport, toxicity,
   and assumed exposure scenarios. For nonpesticide chemicals, very limited
   testing information is generated to support the risk management
   decisions. Despite the restricted quantity of information, risk-based
   predictions are intended to provide analyses that are adequate to
   evaluate ecological safety margins. Persistent questions regarding
   adequacy of protection have dogged risk assessors, regulators, and
   registrants. From a scientific perspective, risk assessments are
   essentially complex hypotheses, not conclusive or factual statements.
   Given the great reliance on extrapolations from individual-based
   toxicity (and generally poor exposure characterizations) to statements
   of community, ecosystem, landscape, regional, and even global levels of
   organization, it is perhaps remarkable that the system has worked at
   all. But do we really know if the system works? If we wish to retain a
   scientific basis in registration, follow-up work that tests the
   risk-prediction hypotheses needs to be done. Properly structured around
   testable parameters, focused monitoring programs could reduce much of
   the mystery embodied in current practice. Greater reliance on monitoring
   data to test risk predictions could reduce the tendency to concatenate
   uncertainty factors that unnecessarily expand Type II errors. We propose
   changes in the registration process to address these concerns.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of separate sexes as a means of avoiding
   self-fertilization requires the controversial coexistence of large
   inbreeding depression and high selfing rate in the ancestral
   hermaphrodite population. Fitness components of adult females and
   hermaphrodites in nature, of their open-pollinated progeny, and of
   experimental selfs and outcrosses onto hermaphrodites were compared in
   endemic Hawaiian Bidens sandvicensis, all of whose known populations are
   gynodioecious, consisting of a mixture of females and hermaphrodites.
   Multilocus selfing rates of hermaphrodites were also estimated, and sex
   morph ratio monitored over four seasons in three populations of B.
   sandvicensis and one population of gynodioecious B. cervicata. Total
   mean inbreeding depression in seed set (in the glasshouse), germination
   rate (in an open-air nursery on Kauai), and first year survivorship and
   fecundity in the field were estimated as 0.94 (SE 0.04), and occurred
   primarily in drought months. Lower survivorship and fecundity of selfs
   were partially explained by their consistently smaller size.
   Open-pollinated seed of females had significantly lower germination
   rate, proportion flowering, and fecundity than outcrossed progeny of
   hermaphrodites, suggesting moderate biparental inbreeding in females and
   a lack of any non-outcrossing advantage to progeny of females. In all
   fitness components, open-pollinated progeny of hermaphrodites were
   inferior to those of females and to outcrosses, and in most components
   were superior to selfs. Total performance of open-pollinated progeny of
   females relative to those of hermaphrodites was calculated as 2.3 (SE =
   0.4), but since inflorescences of females also set 20\% to 50\% more
   seed than those of hermaphrodites, their total relative ovule success
   was estimated as 3.2 (SE = 0.5). If inheritance of male sterility is
   nuclear, this superiority is sufficient to maintain females in
   frequencies over 20\% in populations, whose actual frequencies ranged
   from 14\% to 33\%. In four populations, selfing rates of hermaphrodites,
   assayed in seedlings, were 0.50, 0.45, 0.25, and 0.30, but since
   substantial inbreeding depression occurred prior to germination, the
   mean selfing rate of hermaphrodite ovules exceeded 0.57. female
   frequencies were significantly higher in the two populations with higher
   hermaphrodite selfing rate. These results suggest that inbreeding
   depression can exert a profound influence on the mating system of
   self-compatible plants on Hawaii and perhaps other oceanic islands, and
   can be sufficiently strong to electively favor the elimination of the
   male function.}},

Abstract = {{Present management of the north-east Arctic cod and haddock stocks is
   based on scientific assessments of stock abundance. The assessment
   procedures apply acoustic and bottom-trawl survey indices of abundance
   for tuning of the VPG (virtual population analysis). The reliability of
   the survey indices is strongly dependent on the precision and accuracy
   of the fish sampling conducted with trawls. Variation in bottom trawl
   catches and vertical distribution of cod and haddock from a small area
   were studied with the aim of finding environmental factors of
   explanatory importance for the observed variation. Data were obtained
   over a period of three days from two vessels trawling in parallel, one
   of which simultaneously collected acoustic information on vertical
   distribution. Variation in catch size and length composition was
   analysed and related to the observed vertical distribution. The results
   show that tidal currents affect the vertical distribution of cod and
   haddock and, hence, the availability to the bottom trawl. On the other
   hand, light intensity apparently affects the catch efficiency of the
   sampling trawl. Consequently, the abundance estimates from acoustic and
   bottom-trawl surveys are affected by the interaction of diel rhythms in
   tidal current and light intensity. This illustrates the importance of
   monitoring the environmental factors that influence fish behaviour in
   order to increase the reliability of the abundance estimates. (C) 1996

Abstract = {{On potted nonfruiting host trees in outdoor field cages, we evaluated
   attraction of released mature laboratory-cultured or wild-origin
   Mediterranean fruit flies (medflies) to odor of freshly picked fruit of
   host and nonhost plants. Odor of ripe intact or crushed coffee fruit
   (the presumed ancestral host of medflies) was significantly more
   attractive than odor of ripe intact or crushed fruit of five
   lower-ranking hosts and three nonhosts. Odor of crushed coffee fruit was
   significantly more attractive than odor of intact coffee fruit. Odor of
   ripe or near-ripe coffee fruit was significantly more attractive than
   odor of unripe coffee fruit. Immature females (without eggs) were
   significantly more attracted to odor of a proteinaceous food lure than
   to odor of ripe coffee fruit, whereas the reverse was true for mature
   females carrying a high egg load. In some trials, males proved as
   discriminating as females in favor of coffee fruit odor, but in several
   other trials males were less discriminating than females. Response
   patterns of mature laboratory-cultured females were similar to those of
   mature wild-origin females. In a field of coffee plants, attraction of
   natural-population females was significantly greater to odor of ripe
   coffee fruit than to water but was not greater than attraction to odor
   of proteinaceous food. Findings are discussed in relation to potential
   use of synthetic volatiles of coffee or other host fruit in traps for
   monitoring or controlling medflies.}},

Title = {{Size-dependent resource allocation and costs of reproduction in

Abstract = {{1 Sexual reproduction, vegetative propagation and growth of Pinguicula
   vulgaris were monitored at two sites in Alberta, Canada during a single
   growing season. Seed number, biomass invested in growth, and vegetative
   propagation (gemmae production) were used as indices of resource
   allocation. Allocations to sexual reproduction, vegetative propagation
   and growth were analysed relative to allocation to the other two
   functions, plant size (winter bud mass), and site.
   2 The effects of plant size on patterns of resource investment were not
   consistent. Allocation to growth varied negatively with plant size,
   particularly in large fruiting plants. In contrast, sexual reproduction
   and gemmae production varied positively with plant size: seed and fruit
   production increased allometrically, whereas allocation to gemmae was
   isometric.
   3 In isolation from the effects of plant size, trade-offs occurred
   between sexual reproduction and vegetative functions (growth and gemmae
   production), whereas vegetative propagation and growth varied
   positively. Decreased gemmae production by fruiting plants, even after
   the effects of reproduction on growth had been accounted for, implied
   that: (1) reproduction affected vegetative propagation and growth
   independently; (2) growth was favoured over vegetative propagation; and
   (3) reproduction was more costly than indicated by simple trade-offs.
   Positive relations between growth and vegetative propagation probably
   arise because gemmae are in effect axillary buds on the over-wintering
   structure.
   4 These allocation patterns, combined with threshold sizes for
   reproduction, suggest an emphasis on growth until a minimum size is
   reached. Beyond this threshold, resources not required to maintain size
   seem to be allocated to current reproduction. We suggest that resource
   allocation by P. vulgaris may reflect growth form and phenology as well
   as the relative probabilities of adult, gemmae and seedling survival.
   Plants of similar growth form and/or phenology, such as bulb- or
   corm-forming species, probably employ similar strategies of resource
   allocation.}},

Abstract = {{We initiated a program to reduce the level of resistance to 3 pyrethroid
   insecticides-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, and esfenvalerate-in a field
   population (RHA) of German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.), in
   urban apartments buildings. Applications of all py rethroids to
   RHA-infested apartments stopped in July 1990, and control was provided
   primarily by chlorpyrifos. By using resistance ratios (RR) at LC(50), we
   used the level of cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, and esfenvalerate resistance
   in the RHA population periodically to monitor field responses of
   collected cockroaches for 13 generations (F-1-F-13). The resistance
   ratio for cypermethrin declined from 180 in July 1990 to 123 in March
   1991 (F-2) to 66 in October 1991 (F-5), to 41 in October 1992 (F-9), and
   to 2.5 in October 1993 (F-13) For cyfluthrin resistance, the 27 RR
   (1990) declined to 3.3 in 1993. For esfenvalerate resistance, the 17 RR
   in 1991 declined to 4.6 in 1993. The percentage reduction of apartment
   infestations of RHA 2 wk after application of 0.2\% (AI) cypermethrin
   increased from 20\% in 1990 to 76\% in 1993 after 3 yr without exposure.
   Percent reduction of RHA infestation provided by cyfluthrin increased
   from 49\% in 1991 (F-1) to 74\% in 1993 (F-13). The resistance ratio
   based on LD(50) and percentage reduction data appear to be reliable
   indications of the return of limited pyrethroid susceptibility to the
   RHA population.}},

Abstract = {{Core samples and cylindrical pupal traps were used to monitor immature
   stages of the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), and house fly, Musca
   domestica L., from 5 sample areas In beef feedlot pens: the feed
   apron-soil interface, the back fence, the side (pen dividing) fence, the
   mound, and the general lot. One feedlot was sampled during 1986, two
   feedlots were sampled in 1987, and three samples were taken at random
   from each sample area on each sample date. Core samples showed that both
   populations were highest from the feed apron sample area. Pupal traps
   tended to show the same result but differences between sample areas were
   not significant for immature stable flies. Both sampling methods
   generally indicated similar population trends of the 2 fly species over
   the season; correlation coefficients between the 2 sampling methods were
   generally significant but few correlations were strong and large
   divergences between population trends were present. Only approximate to
   69\% of the total number of pupal traps placed were recovered; the loss
   of traps could have contributed to differences between the 2 sampling
   methods. Core sampling would be preferred if lower variance of samples
   is important; if collecting pupae of known age is important, then pupal
   traps may be useful if they are protected from trampling by cattle.}},

Abstract = {{Citricola scale, Coccus pseudomagnoliarum (Kuwana), infesting Chinese
   hackberry, Celtis sinensis Persoon, was studied during 1991-1994 in
   Davis, CA. Female scale and crawler densities on untreated trees
   increased each year in comparison with previous years; populations of
   this introduced subtropical species were recovering from a population
   decline possibly induced by cold temperatures in northern California
   during the winter of 1990-1991. In California, European fruit lecanium,
   Parthenolecanium corni (Bouche). P. pruinosum (Coquillett), and Calico
   scale, Eulecanium cerasorum (Cockerell), also infest Chinese hackberry.
   However, citricola scale was 5-25 times more abundant than the
   Parthenolecanium species combined, and no calico scale were found on
   sample branches. Citricola scale was more abundant in the east and north
   tree canopy in comparison with tile sunnier south canopy; abiotic
   mortality from hot, dry conditions may help to reduce scale populations.
   Transparent sticky tape traps helped monitor scale crawler populations
   and were used to time foliar-season control actions. The number of
   crawlers trapped depended on scale density, not sticky trap size.
   Crawler density peaked at 353 DD (SD = 43) above 11 degrees C
   accumulated from 1 March, but laboratory development rate and threshold
   temperature data and sampling from other locations are needed to
   validate this empirical model. Thr ee control methods were equally
   effective: a single foliar spray of 2\% superior oil, acephate implants
   during the foliar season, or a single application of 3\% supreme oil to
   bark during the dormant season. Each method reduced scale populations by
   approximate to 50\% during the season of treatment, but there was no
   difference among treatments 1 yr after control actions. Apparent
   parasitism of female citricola scale in Davis, CA, was only approximate
   to 1\%. Parasitism was significantly lower on treated trees.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies were conducted in 12 locations in southeastern Virginia to

   catch to peanut pod damage as it occurred throughout the season.
   Pheromone traps caught more beetles than TIC or cinnamaldehyde on most
   sample dates and at most locations. Pheromone traps detected 2 distinct
   beetle peaks, the Ist between 1 and 23 June, and the 2nd between 21 and.
   28 July, and consistently caught more males than females. TIC and
   cinnamaldehyde traps caught more females in 14 out of 180 observations
   (15 sample dates, 12 locations) and failed to detect the 2nd beetle
   peak. Peanut pod damage began to increase in all locations at the end of
   July. Total pod damage (immature plus mature pods) exceeded 40\% in all
   but one location. Peak damage occurred at all but 1 location on
   approximate to 11 August. Peak pod damage by southern corn rootworm
   larvae consistently lagged behind the 2nd peak in the beetle population
   by 2.1 +/- 0.5 (+/-SEM) wk. Number of beetles trapped accounted for only
   10\% of the variance observed in peak pod damage. Use of pheromone traps
   by growers could allow fbr a more precise timing of insecticide
   applications and improve management of southern corn rootworm in peanut.}},

Abstract = {{Six subterranean termite colonies, representing two species,
   Reticulitermes flavipes and R. uirginicus were characterized and baited
   during the spring and summer of 1993 at three locations in the Piedmont
   Soil Zone in west-central Georgia. Characterizations included population
   and foraging territory estimates, indices of activity, wood consumption
   rates, and number of termites collected per site per visit. The four
   characterized colonies that were baited averaged 43,000 termites per
   colony and occupied foraging territories averaging 16 m(2). An
   additional 12 colonies were baited in 1994 simulating a commercial bait
   application where only indices of termite activity were recorded. Each
   termite colony was baited using a prototype baiting system which
   included the active ingredient hexaflumuron. Activity of each colony was
   monitored before, during, and after baiting. Three of the characterized
   colonies were baited during June and July 1993, and activity was
   undetectable within 3 months. One colony, baited in September, continued
   to show activity for 8 months. Six of the colonies baited in 1994 showed
   no activity at least 5 months after bait acceptance, two colonies
   removed bait starting in September and were still showing activity in
   May, two colonies did not revisit monitors following bait stake attack,
   and one colony did not accept bait and remained active in the nearby
   monitor. Colony characterizations, baiting procedures, measures of
   termite activity, and the difficulties of determining termite baiting

Abstract = {{An aerobic fluidized bed reactor process with internal media cleaning to
   control attached biomass thickness was developed. Biomass-control was
   achieved by the periodic creation of a turbulent zone within a specially
   designed cylindrical screened region surrounding the effluent port. A
   screen washer aided in keeping the cylindrical screen clean. A bed
   lifter produced turbulence throughout the bed to allow individual media
   particles to enter the cleaning zone for the removal of excess biofilm.
   The reactor system operated continuously without excessive biomass
   buildup on the support media and without the need for external media
   cleaning or recovery. Four analytical methods-systematic scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) analyses, granular activated carbon drained
   density, phospholipid analyses, and fluorescein diacetate activity (FDA)
   measurements-were modified/developed for use in characterizing the
   microbial population attached to the media of the fluidized bed. The SEM
   analyses was valuable for monitoring changes the cleaning cycle caused
   to the biofilm. Phospholipid and FDA analyses were found to have
   potential for use as design and monitoring tools of the process.}},

Abstract = {{Although occupational epidemiological studies and animal experimentation
   provide strong evidence that radon-222 (Rn-222) progeny exposure causes
   lung cancer, residential epidemiological studies have not confirmed this
   association. Past residential epidemiological studies have yielded
   contradictory findings. Exposure misclassification has seriously
   compromised the ability of these studies to detect whether an
   association exists between Rn-222, exposure and lung cancer.
   Misclassification of Rn-222 exposure has arisen primarily from. I)
   detector measurement error; 2) failure to consider temporal and spatial
   (222)R, variations within a home; 3) missing data from previously
   occupied homes that currently are inaccessible; 4) failure to link
   Rn-222 concentrations with subject mobility; and 5) measuring Rn-222 gas
   concentration as a surrogate for Rn-222 progeny exposure. This paper
   examines these methodological dosimetry problems and addresses how we
   are accounting for them in an ongoing, population-based, case-control
   study of Rn-222 and lung cancer in Iowa.}},

Abstract = {{Many lake trout Salvelinus namaycush spawn in shallow areas along
   windswept shores. However, precise determination of time and location of
   spawning is limited by its nocturnal occurrence, and possibly by some
   postulated, but unproven, spawning in deep water by certain populations.
   In White Pine Lake, Ontario, a well-studied experimental lake, lake
   trout spawn in two shallow locations where some direct observation is
   possible. Radiotelemetry apparatus was used in 1991 to obtain records of
   the electromyograms (EMGs) produced by muscle activity in one adult male
   and one adult female lake trout, captured from the lake before their
   reproductive period and returned to the lake at the beginning of the
   spawning period. Both fish survived, though only the male was detected
   as active over the main spawning site, where it showed evening EMG
   activity patterns indicating considerable activity. At other rimes of
   day, when not located over the spawning site, but present elsewhere in
   the lake, the male's EMG (i.e. muscle) values were considerably reduced.
   At the cessation of the spawning period, the transmitter-equipped male's
   EMG record showed no further pattern indicative of high activity during
   what had formerly been the daily spawning period. The female was tracked
   as she moved around the lake, but based on both her location and level
   of EMG activity, is thought not to have spawned. In 1992, a second male
   was captured, equipped with a transmitter and released again. This fish
   failed to show spawning activity but, as with the 1991 female, moved
   fairly considerable distances in the lake. In one instance, in a swim of
   short duration (6 min), well away from the spawning: grounds, this fish
   displayed EMG activity levels resembling those of the high activity of
   spawning. The results obtained appear to demonstrate that EMG telemetry
   could be used to assess the level of muscular activity occurring in lake
   trout, especially in relation to reproductive behaviour, and when they
   cannot be directly observed. (C) 1996 The Fisheries Society of the

Abstract = {{Cross-reactivity between several commercially available mouse antihuman
   monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) and
   fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) fluorochromes, and peripheral blood
   leukocyte surface antigens, has been established in infant cynomolgus
   (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys using whole blood lysis, and two-color, PE
   and FITC flow cytometric analysis. With the exception of the CD8 marker,
   the bivariate dot-plot patterns for all other markers were similar in
   infant monkeys and in humans. For the CD8 marker, however, a
   CD8(+)CD2(-) population of cells was observed in the majority of monkeys
   tested (10 out of 12). The number of CD8(+)CD2(-) cells was higher
   (13\%) in infant monkeys compared to the 3\% reported for adult human
   blood. The mean percentage and absolute numbers for the cell surface
   markers identified with the human mAbs CD2 (FITC, Ortho, Paritan, NJ),
   CD4 (PE, B-D, Mountain View, CA), and CD8 (PE, B-D) when these were
   combined with a series of PE- or FITC-labelled human mAbs were similar
   across all combinations tested, Statistically significant differences
   were observed between male and female monkeys for the mean percentage
   levels of CD4 (females > males) and for the CD4/CD8 ratio (females >
   males). Such gender differences need to be taken into consideration when
   infant cynomolgus monkeys are used as models for chemical-induced
   immunotoxicity studies. Measurement of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) and
   transferrin proved to be useful in monitoring in vitro cellular
   activation in infant cynomolgus and possibly in rhesus (M. mulatta)
   monkeys.}},

   of hazelnut, cultivars Tonda Gentile Romana and Nocchione, were
   inoculated with a Pseudomonas syringae pv. avellanae strain through leaf
   scars located midway from the tip of the twig. In adult trees, the
   systemic migration and the population level of the pathogen were
   monitored during autumn and winter by means of weekly to monthly
   isolation and countings. In young plants, the possible displacement of
   the bacterium was checked in May by sampling different sites of the
   plant. At each sampling, the presence of internal and external symptoms
   was carefully assessed. During the 2-year study, the results on
   migration and symptom development were consistent between the cultivars.
   Until the end of February, P.s. pv. avellanae colonized for
   approximately 45 mm, only the trait of the twig below the site of
   inoculation. At that time the population level ranged, in the farthest
   point reached by the pathogen, from 4.1 to 5.6 = 10(4) cfu/3 mm of
   twig-portion. During March the pathogen was recovered from the tip of
   the twig. The first sign of disease was noticed in November as brown
   discolouration of the epidermis near the site of inoculation as well as
   internal necrosis of the vascular tissue. In young trees, P.s. pv.
   avellanae from the twig reached the branches, collar and roots from
   where it also colonized the branch which did not carry an inoculated
   leaf scar. Extensive twig dieback was noticed during April, whereas in
   June, most of the adult trees inoculated in autumn with approximately 25
   000 cells of the pathogen, randomly distributed in 25 sites of the
   crown, wilted completely. The role of leaf scars as a favourite site of
   penetration exploited by the pathogen as well as phytosanitary measures
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We review management of oyster stocks infected by Perkinsus marinus,
   comparing previously published recommendations with current practices,
   with emphasis on the public fishery in the Maryland portion of
   Chesapeake Bay. The epizootiology of perkinsiasis is described,
   particularly the spread of the disease into low salinity areas. We also
   describe recent attempts to develop a policy and management framework
   for restoration of oyster populations that have been depleted by P.
   marinus and Haplosporidium nelsoni. It is apparent from experiences in
   Gulf of Mexico estuaries, Long Island Sound, and Maryland that strong
   recruitment can, to some extent, offset the impacts of P. marinus on
   oyster fisheries. Although improved management practices so far have had
   very limited success in maintaining harvestable stocks in the
   Chesapeake, it is clear that the recruitment potential of oyster
   populations has not been diminished to a critical point. Strategies
   designed to enhance and supplement natural recruitment, along with
   maintaining growing areas as free from P. marinus infections as
   possible, currently offer the most promise for maintaining harvestable
   stocks. In combination, new developments in research, management,
   monitoring, and policy are cause for guarded optimism, both for larger,
   sustainable harvests and for restoration of some of the ecological
   functions of healthy oyster populations.}},

Abstract = {{A pheromone trapping system was established in a confectionery factory
   to monitor Ephestia cautella activity, E. cautella was found to be
   distributed throughout the factory in an aggregated pattern, which
   persisted for most of the study. The highly restricted nature of the
   population indicated that the blanket application of synergised
   pyrethrins was unnecessary in most areas, Analysis also indicated that
   the application of pyrethrins had Little influence on the distribution
   of E. cautella or male moth capture rate, Hygiene, and the distance from
   an area regarded as a population source, were found to most influence E.
   cautella distribution, It was concluded that an integrated management
   strategy relying on pheromone trapping to monitor adult E. cautella plus
   improved sanitation practices to remove existing larval rearing sites
   and minimise potential development sites, was likely to provide superior
   control of E. cautella than the blanket application of synergised

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Adaptive management of waterfowl harvests accounts for uncertainties
   about population responses to harvest, with a focus on the reduction of
   uncertainties pursuant to harvest objectives and other management goals.
   Important sources of uncertainty include limited knowledge about
   underlying biological relationships (structural uncertainty), sampling
   variation in population monitoring (partial observability), and
   uncontrolled variation in the setting of harvest rates (partial
   controllability). We used a model for adaptive harvest management to
   investigate the use of harvests in reducing structural uncertainties.
   The model allows for both compensatory and additive relationships
   between harvest and survival, and also includes predictors incorporating
   the compensatory and additive hypotheses, along with a procedure for
   updating predictor probabilities. The model was used to (i) characterize
   population changes through time, and predict population changes based on
   simulated data; (ii) compare predicted and observed population sizes in
   an effort to identify the appropriate predictor for the population; and
   (iii) examine the effect of harvest rate, monitoring variation, and
   partial controllability on the rate of reduction in structural
   uncertainty. Results indicate that harvest can be used to learn about
   additive and compensatory relationships, whichever is operative for a
   population. Within limits, learning can occur even with imprecise data
   about population status, and with substantial imprecision in the setting
   of harvest rates. However, learning rates are depressed by high levels
   of monitoring and/or harvest imprecision.}},

Abstract = {{We estimated litter size, birthrate (proportion of F with young in
   mid-Jun), and survival of young to winter for lynx (Lynx lynx) in
   southwest Yukon between 1990 and 1992. Radiocollared females were
   located shortly after parturition to count young, and relocated in
   winter to count the number of surviving young from tracks. Hare (Lepus
   americanus) density, as estimated by pellet transects, peaked at 7.4
   hares/ha in 1990 and began to decline in winter 1990-91. Reproducing
   lynx faced a declining food supply in spring 1991. Litter size averaged
   5.3 (n = 12) for adults (>2 yr) and 4.2 (n = 5) for yearlings in 1990,
   and all females monitored had litters in mid-June. Adult litter size was
   4.9 in 1991 (n = 15) and 16 of 19 adult females (84\%) had litters in
   mid-June. None of 7 yearlings retained litters in 1991. In 1992 none of
   7 adult or 3 yearling females retained litters. Minimum survival
   estimated from track counts was 0.63 in 1990 and 0.75 in 1991 for
   kittens of adult mothers. Survival was 0.26 in 1990 for kittens of
   yearlings. Recruitment to 1 year of age was 2.8 kittens per adult
   female, and 0.55 kittens per yearling female in 1990. In 1991
   recruitment was 3.2 from adults and 0.08 from yearlings. Lynx
   recruitment went from a peak in 1990 to zero reproductive output in
   1992. Adult females managed to recruit young the year after the hare
   peak, but recruitment from yearlings virtually ceased in the first year
   of the hare decline. Recruitment from yearlings was surprisingly low,
   even in the peak hare year. If this observation describes other lynx
   populations, it has serious ramifications for trapped populations, which
   are often composed largely of yearlings. Population models which have
   based yearling recruitment on in utero data probably have overestimated
   recruitment and sustainable harvest.}},

Abstract = {{A population of frillneck lizards, Chlamydosaurus kingii, was monitored
   by mark-recapture and telemetry over a 2 year period in Kakadu National
   Park. The aims of the study were to document changes in diet, growth,
   condition and habitat use between the wet and dry seasons of northern
   Australia, in light of recent research examining seasonal variation in
   the physiology of this species. Frillneck lizards feed on a diverse
   range of invertebrates in both seasons, even though there is a
   substantial reduction in food availability in the dry season. Harvester
   termites from the genus Drepanotermes constitute a major component of
   the diet, and the prevalence of termites in the diet of sedentary
   foragers in a tropical environment is unusual. Adult male body condition
   remained relatively stable throughout the year, but females experienced
   considerable variation. These differences are attributed to different
   reproductive roles of the sexes. Growth in C. kingii was restricted to
   the wet season, when food availability was high, and growth was minimal
   in the dry season when food availability was low The method used in
   catching lizards was an important factor in determining seasonal habitat
   use. Telemetered lizards selected a significantly different distribution
   of tree species than was randomly available, and they selected
   significantly larger tree species during the dry season. Lizards spotted
   along roadsides showed little seasonal variation in the selection of
   tree species or tree sizes. The results suggest a comprehensive change
   in the ecology of this species, in response to an annual cycle of low
   food and moisture availability, followed by a period with few resource
   restrictions.}},

Abstract = {{Will increased fruit and seed production in a severely
   pollination-limited orchid stimulate population growth? We tested
   whether safe sites for germination and seedling establishment are
   Limiting for the twig epiphyte, Tolumnia variegata, by manipulating
   fruit set and monitoring subsequent seedling establishment for two
   seasons (1991-1992, 1992-1993). in the Cambalache Forest Reserve of
   Puerto Rico, we established 36 plots along a transect. Each plot
   consisted of nine trees. A center tree was designated as the site for
   attaching TolIumnia and manipulating fruit set. The other eight
   potential host trees were 1-3 and 3-5 m from the center tree in each of
   the cardinal directions. A l-m length of stem Im from the ground was
   monitored for recruits on each of the nine frees of 24 fruit-enhanced
   plots and 12 controls (23 and 13, respectively for the 1992-1993
   season). Fruit enhancement plots were divided among two treatments:
   one-fruit and five-fruit additions for the Ist year and one to five and
   more than five fruits for the 2nd year. Availability of suitable host
   species was not limiting. T. variegata showed little specificity for
   host tree species, good host trees and shrubs were common, and there was
   no evidence that the orchid had a preference for small branches, despite
   possessing the entire suite of characteristics thought to represent
   `'obligate'' twig epiphytes. Fruit enhancement increased seed rain and
   seedling establishment consistently in only the high-fruit treatment
   plots. Most recruitment occurred near fruiting plants. Over the 2-year
   period, mortality was 18\% for adults and 85.5\% for the 1991-1992
   cohort of recruits. Net recruitment was positive for both the treatment
   (average = 1.74) and control plots (average = 0.67). Seedling
   establishment at our study site was not microsite-limited, If selection
   for increased pollinator attraction occurs, then an increase in seed
   output should result in population growth.}},

Abstract = {{A guild of six species of intestinal protozoan (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae)
   was monitored in 496 live-trapped Wyoming ground squirrels (Spermophilus
   elegans) in two populations in 1989 and 1990. Three species were present
   at high levels (>40\% of all squirrels infected at any time) and three
   at low levels (<20\% infected) in both populations within and across
   years. Results of logistic regression indicated that age of individual
   was a key parameter in predicting infection within each of the species.
   For the common species, adults had a higher probability of infection
   than juveniles and the observed number of reinfections in recaptured
   squirrels was slightly greater than predicted. For the three rare
   species, juveniles had a higher probability of infection than adults and
   there was a slight decrease in probability of reinfection. Over the two
   years, time of sampling had no effect on probability of infection. There
   was no evidence for negative interactions (competition) between guild
   members but several positive interactions were noted. This eimerian
   guild appears stable within these populations and we hypothesize that
   the three prevalent species are commensals (little or no effect on host
   fitness) and the three low prevalence species have a greater effect on
   host fitness (''parasite''). Further, some species of this assemblage
   also infect two other species of sciurids sympatric with the Wyoming
   ground squirrel. The processes important in structuring this assemblage
   may include the differential immune response of the host animals to the
   different eimerian species, the non-limiting resource base (the
   intestinal epithelia), the high reproductive capacities of the eimerian
   species, the varying ability of infective oocysts for each species to
   persist under ambient environmental conditions, the high colonization
   rates of host populations, and the ability of the symbionts to infect
   sympatric host species.}},

Abstract = {{Light-harvesting capacities of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II
   (PSII) in a wild-type and three chlorophyll b-deficient mutant strains
   of rice were determined by measuring the initial slope of light-response
   curve of PSI and PSII electron transport and kinetics of light-induced
   redox changes of P-700 and Q(A), respectively, The light-harvesting
   capacity of PSI determined by the two methods was only moderately
   reduced by chlorophyll b-deficiency. Analysis of the fluorescence
   induction that monitors time course of Q(A) photoreduction showed that
   both relative abundance and antenna size of PSIIalpha decrease with
   increasing deficiency of chlorophyll I, and there is only PSIIbeta in
   chlorina 2 which totally lacks chlorophyll b. The numbers of antenna
   chlorophyll molecules associated with the mutant PSII centers were,
   therefore, three to five times smaller than that of PSIIalpha in the
   wild type rice. Rates of PSII electron transport determined on the basis
   of PSII centers in the three mutants were 60-70\% of that in the normal
   plant at all photon flux densities examined, indicating that substantial
   portions of the mutant PSTI centers are inactive in electron transport,
   The initial slopes of light-response curves of PSII electron transport
   revealed that the functional antenna sizes of the active populations of
   PSII. centers in the mutants correspond to about half that of PSIIalpha
   in the wild type rice. Thus, the numbers of chlorophyll molecules that
   serve as antenna of the oxygen-evolving PSII centers in the mutants are
   significantly larger than those that are actually associated with each
   PSII center, It is proposed that the inactive PSII serves as an antenna
   of the active PSII in the three chlorophyll b-deficient mutants of rice,
   In spite of the reduced antenna size of PSII, therefore, the total
   light-harvesting capacity of PSII approximately matches that of PSI in
   the mutants.}},

Abstract = {{Urban air pollution is a major environmental problem in the developing
   countries of the world. WHO and UNEP created an air pollution monitoring
   network as part of the Global Environment Monitoring System. This
   network now covers over 50 cities in 35 developing and developed
   countries throughout the world. The analyses of the data reported by the
   network over the past 15-20 yr indicate that the lessons of the prior
   experiences in the developed countries (U.S.A., U.K.) have not been
   learned. A study of air pollution in 20 of the 24 megacities of the
   world (over 10 million people by year 2000) shows that ambient air
   pollution concentrations are at levels where serious health effects are
   reported. The expected rise of population in the next century, mainly in
   the developing countries with a lack of capital for air pollution
   control, means that there is a great potential that conditions will
   worsen in many more cities that will reach megacity status. This paper
   maps the potential for air pollution that cities will experience in the
   future unless control strategies are developed and implemented during
   the next several decades.}},

Abstract = {{Due to limited land and great emphasis on economic growth in the past,
   Taiwan has an extremely heavy environmental burden. Population density,
   factory density, as well as densities of motor vehicles are several
   times higher than those in the United States and Japan. According to the
   statistics of 1991, the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) fell mostly in
   the `'moderate'' category, i.e., in the range of 50-100. There were
   16.25\% of the monitored days with PSI above 100, and 0.51\% with PSI
   beyond 200. Suspended particulates were the major pollutant responsible
   for PSI above 100, followed by carbon monoxide, ozone, and sulfur
   dioxide.
   The measures adopted to control air pollution can be divided into four
   categories, namely law and regulations, control measures on stationary
   sources, mobile sources and construction projects. The latest amended
   Air Pollution Control Act was promulgated on 1 February 1992. Several
   major revisions were introduced to make the amended Act much more
   stringent than the 1982 amendment, especially on the offenses likely to
   endanger public health and welfare. In regard to stationary sources, a
   permit system was enacted to regulate the establishment and alteration
   of stationary sources. Designated stationary sources are required to be
   equipped with automatic monitoring facilities. An inspection and
   enforcement program have expanded to cover more than 10,000 factories.
   Major control measures for motor vehicles include introducing stringent
   emission standards for gasoline-fueled vehicles and diesel cars, setting
   up ratification and approval program for new vehicle model, promoting
   the inspection/maintenance program on in-used motorcycles and
   encouraging the use of unleaded and low sulfur fuels. In order to
   control the pollution caused by construction work, constructors are
   required to use low-pollution machinery and engineering methods and
   incorporate pollution prevention into the construction budget.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to elevated concentrations of ambient air pollutants causes
   adverse human health effects. Two modes or methods of study are
   generally relied on to quantify the relationships between pollutants and
   specific effects. These are: human clinical experiments and
   epidemiological (or community exposure) studies. (Animal toxicological
   studies can be used to indicate the existence of an effect, but not the
   rate of the effect in humans.) Each method has limitations as a basis
   for quantifying the level of adverse effects anticipated in a given
   human population as a result of exposure. Consequently, care must be
   taken in deciding which studies are appropriate for assessment of health
   impacts in a population. Some limitations are inherent in the method.
   Epidemiological studies, for example, depend on adequate community
   monitoring and the ability to associate a cohort with ambient data.
   Clinical studies often do not represent the complex mix of pollutants in
   the atmosphere. Consequently, construction of dose/exposure-response
   functions is challenging. Another common complication in quantifying
   expected health impacts of a pollutant mix is lack of adequate ambient
   monitoring data coupled with little or no knowledge of a population's
   time and activity profiles. This paper summarizes the difficulties
   inherent in constructing estimates of health effects in populations
   living in densely populated and polluted areas and suggests approaches
   to making initial limited estimates. An example of the level of effort
   required to conduct a sophisticated study, using relatively rich
   databases, is given based on work done in the Southern California
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Birds make up a trivial proportion of species on earth. Yet they are
   extremely important, simply because there are so few species of birds
   and we know so much about so many of them. This rich source of
   information can be used to develop and test general theories about the
   distribution and abundance of organisms, important both for ecologists
   and conservationists. This paper examines the relationship between local
   population abundance and the size of species' geographic ranges,
   textures of population abundance within ranges, and what happens at the
   edges of species' geographic distributions. Implications for
   conservation are emphasized. Within the highly modified landscape of
   Britain, birds are apparently not good indicators of species-rich sites
   of high conservation importance for other taxa, but in many other ways
   are perfect `model organisms' for monitoring and understanding human
   impacts on ecological systems. The biggest threat to all species over
   the next century is human-induced global environmental change; bird
   populations are, and will increasingly be, of crucial importance both

Abstract = {{The chaetognath population at Resolute in the Canadian high Arctic (75
   degrees N) was monitored biweekly during 1993. Parasagitta elegans
   composed 98.9\% of the population, and Eukrohnia hamata made up the
   remaining 1.1\%. The proportion of E. hamata increased east toward
   Baffin Bay. Parasagitta elegans had a 700-d Life-span at a mean annual
   temperature of about -1.5 degrees C. The population of P. elegans at
   Resolute had a mean annual density of 191 . m(-2), weighed 0.409 g dry
   weight . m(-2), respired 1.259 g O-2 . m(-2). y(-1), and grew 0.566 g
   dry weight . m(-2). yr(-1), with a 0.40 net growth efficiency and a P:B
   (production : biomass) ratio of 1.38. It made up 5.7\% of the
   macroplankon biomass by weight, respired 1.5\% of its total oxygen
   consumption, and consumed 1.78 g dry weight prey . m(-2). yr(-1), a
   minimum of 0.1\%. d(-1) or 36\% of the mean annual copepod biomass.}},
