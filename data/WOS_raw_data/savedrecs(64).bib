Abstract = {{Seasonal patterns of reproduction in a newly established population of
   Dreissena polymorpha are described for a site in the western basin of
   Lake Erie. Reproduction was monitored by histological examination of
   gonads, analysis of shell length-dry weight relationships, and following
   abundance of planktonic and settling larvae. Patterns of planktonic
   larval abundance and settling showed a distinct bimodal pattern in July
   and August, but conflicted with histological and length-dry weight data
   that showed spawning was a brief, highly synchronous event occurring in
   late August. Differences between histological data and abundance of
   larvae in the plankton can be explained as resulting from drift of
   larvae from disjunct populations of D. polymorpha which spawned earlier,
   into the study area. Veliger larvae were present in the plankton at low
   densities throughout the warm months before and after periods of peak
   abundances. The presence of these larvae can be explained by a
   combination of asynchronous spawning among local populations and
   postponed settlement by planktonic larvae.}},

Abstract = {{Predatory carabids, staphylinids and spiders were monitored from 1981 to
   1987 in a Dutch project concerning the development of arable farming
   systems. During this period epigeic predators in the conventional,
   integrated and organic systems were sampled using pitfall traps. The
   effects of crop type and farming system on species diversity, abundance
   and guild structure was analysed using trap data from wheat, pea, sugar
   beet, potato, onion and carrot fields. Predator abundance and species
   composition were found to be clearly affected by the farming system.
   However, in most cases the type of crop appeared to be of greater
   importance. Crops with a greater cover early in the season, like winter
   wheat and peas appeared to be more favourable than late and open crops
   like onions or carrots. Both system and crop effects were more apparent
   in carabids than in spiders or staphylinids. Only minor effects of farm
   management were found on species richness. Again, the crop itself seemed
   to be the main structuring factor. It is concluded that the presence and
   quality of predator populations is mainly determined by crop structure
   and crop-related factors. The role of favourable crops and field size in
   predator enhancement is discussed in relation to the agroecological
   infrastructure of the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The rain forests of Tanzania occupy small areas, mostly confined to
   isolated mountains. Except for some isolated volcanic mountains (Mt.
   Kilimanjaro, Mt. Meru, the Ngorongoro Crater), most of the rain forests
   are confined to the so-called Eastern Arc mountains with old crystalline
   bedrocks. The Eastern Arc rain forests are characterized by high
   biodiversity, and have large numbers of endemic and rare taxa of plants
   and animals. The submontane and montane rain forests are extremely
   important water catchments, providing water for major cities and densely
   populated rural areas. Most of the rain forest catchments are forest
   reserves, but still the human impact around and inside the reserves is
   considerable. Intensive cultivation due to heavy population pressure
   affects the reserves from all sides, leaving the forests isolated,
   fragmented `islands' surrounded by the cultural landscape. Former timber
   production and logging programs initiated by the State and some foreign
   development organizations have depleted large areas of rain forests,
   e.g. in the Usambara Mountains. Extensive, destructive, legal and
   illegal activities such as, e.g. logging, pit-sawing and grazing have
   taken place inside most of the forest reserves. Some research programs
   on rain forest catchments are now being carried out in Tanzania, forming
   a basis for future management and monitoring of the forest reserves. The
   forest authorities are currently much concerned about the problems,
   giving catchment forest management highest priority in the Tropical
   Forestry Action Plan.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was made on the effects of inorganic mercury
   (HgCl2) and methylmercury (CH3HgCl) on freshwater aerobic heterotrophic
   bacterial population. The experimental system was based on
   two-compartment biotopes: natural sediment, from the Garonne River, and
   dechlorinated tap water. The response of bacterial communities to
   mercury additions (to the water column) was monitored by determining
   total Hg in water and enumerating the total number of bacteria and the
   evolution of the mercury resistant community. Isolation was carried out
   by plate count method. Enumeration of mercury resistant strains was made
   with a general medium (Iron-Tryp-tone agar) amended with 10-mu-g Hg/ml
   of HgCl2. The response to 2-mu-g Hg/L (HgCl2) was fast approximately
   50\% of the maximum percentage of mercury resistant bacteria being
   reached after one hour (21.7\% after 17 h exposure). Spikes of CH3HgCl
   (2-mu-g Hg/L) in the water column caused an initial inhibition of growth
   of Hg-resistant and sensitive bacteria followed by a complete recovery
   of the background microbial population after 84 h. Seven mercury
   resistant bacterial strains were isolated from the experimental systems
   and each of them was checked for HgCl2 and CH3HgCl transformation. All
   were able to volatilize HgCl2 by producing elemental mercury, but none
   was able to degrade methylmercury. Additions of different concentrations
   of HgCl2 (0.02-mu-g Hg/L to 2-mu-g Hg/L) to the water column caused a
   proportional increase in the percentage of mercury-resistant bacteria.
   Low concentrations (< 0.6-mu-g Hg/L) of CH3HgCl also induced the
   Hg-resistant community, whereas 2-mu-g Hg/L of CH3HgCl inhibited the
   growth of both Hg-sensitive and Hg-resistant heterotrophic bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Social behavior is one hypothesized cause for dispersal. We tested this
   hypothesis on spruce grouse (Dendragapus canadensis) in two years by
   removing adults in summer and monitoring emigration of juveniles in
   autumn. Despite the absence of adults, juveniles emigrated from the
   natal range at rates comparable to juveniles on control areas. Data on
   density and dispersal from earlier spruce grouse studies are reviewed,
   which show that emigration is constant despite substantial differences
   in density, and that a clear female sex bias occurs across a wide range
   of densities. Results do not support the hypothesis that social behavior
   influences dispersal nor do they support a prediction of the ``Oedipus
   hypothesis{''} that no sex bias occurs in polygynous birds.}},

Abstract = {{The phenology and reproductive status of adults of the redbacked
   cutworm, Euxoa ochrogaster (Guenee), were determined from blacklight
   (BLT) and sex-attractant (SAT) trap catches at four locations in
   southern Manitoba in 1987 through 1989- The flight period was of 9-12
   weeks duration, extending from late June to early October. The first
   male and female moths were captured at about the same time in the BLT
   and SAT. The peak catches of the BLT occurred during the first 3 weeks
   of August (weeks 5 and 6 of the flight period) and those of the SAT
   about 1 week later. The SAT continued to capture male moths for 2-3
   weeks after the last moths appeared in the BLT. Most females captured
   during the first 2-3 weeks of the flight period were virgins who had not
   yet initiated egg development. Most mating, egg development, and
   oviposition took place during a 3- to 4-week period that included the 2
   weeks before, the same week as, and the week after the peak BLT catches
   (weeks 3-7 of the flight period); these activities occurred in the 3-4
   weeks before the peak SAT catches. The data suggested that there was
   competition between SAT and females in attracting males and,
   consequently, the SAT catch data may not be providing accurate
   measurements of the sizes of breeding populations of males in the field.
   The BLT catches underestimated the length of the flight period by about
   1.5-3 weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Bufo periglenes, the golden toad, is an endangered species endemic to
   Costa Rica. Every year from the early 1970s through 1987 golden toads
   have emerged from retreats to breed during April-June. The most recent
   known breeding episode occurred during April-May 1987; more than 1500
   adults were observed at five breeding pools, but a maximum of 29
   tadpoles metamorphosed from these sites. During April-June 1988-90, we
   found only 11 toads during surveys of the breeding habitat. To examine
   the species' apparent decline, we analyzed data on rainfall, water
   temperature, and pH of the breeding pools.
   Our baseline data on weather patterns and characteristics of the
   breeding habitat suggest that warmer water temperatures and less
   advective precipitation during dry season post-1987 may have produced
   adverse breeding conditions. The toads may be alive and hiding in
   retreats awaiting appropriate weather conditions. The apparent scarcity
   of toads may reflect a normal population response to an unpredictable
   environment. On the other hand, because other anurans with different
   breeding specializations seem to be declining from the area as well, one
   wonders whether warmer temperatures and dry conditions could be
   responsible for real population declines. Because the habitat is
   protected and pristine, potential causes of anuran declines such as
   habitat destruction, introduced predators, and collecting seem unlikely.
   Measurements of pH of the breeding pools, cloud water, and precipitation
   do not suggest acid precipitation effects, although we cannot rule out
   the possibility of environmental degradation some time prior to our
   measurements. Long-term monitoring programs combined with carefully
   controlled field experiments are needed to address factors responsible
   for declining amphibians.}},

Abstract = {{A planning workshop was called by IUBS (the International Union of
   Biological Sciences) at the Harvard Forest to develop an international
   research program in biodiversity, including the inventorying and
   monitoring of the world's biological diversity. Workshop participants
   were asked to develop research hypotheses that answer aspects of the
   question `What is the importance of biodiversity for the proper
   functioning of biological systems, from populations to ecosystems?' The
   hypotheses developed dealt with the changes that might be expected in
   biodiversity as a result of anthropogenic activity and also the
   complementary issue of how changes in biodiversity will affect the
   functioning of biological systems. Habitat fragmentation, loss and
   addition of species, changes in the functional and structural attributes
   of ecosystems, and the ability of depauperate ecosystems to respond to
   climatic and other changes, were addressed.
   Two issues emerged from the workshop as needing serious investigation.
   The first is the degree to which each species of plants and animals is
   unique. Many species are similar in appearance; many more perform
   similar ecological functions (primary producers, herbivores,
   decomposers, etc.). However, no two species are alike in their genetic
   structure or in all functional features. A very fundamental question for
   managers and decision-makers is the degree to which a species can
   substitute for another in an ecosystem, that is, how much is ecosystem
   function impaired when a species is lost or gained? Since human
   activities are resulting in both losses and introductions, a careful and
   precise answer to this question is essential.
   The second issue concerns habitat fragmentation. Human activity is
   creating an unprecedented fragmentation of natural habitats and
   ecosystems all over the world. Habitat fragmentation disrupts gene flow
   and propagule dispersal, but can result in increased speciation and
   differentiation of populations. Much more information is needed before
   it will be possible to predict the effects of habitat fragmentation.
   Without this information precise management of natural and artificial
   ecosystems is not possible. It is one of the issues tagged by the
   workshop as of crucial importance for future research.
   The workshop pointed out once more the serious problem that the decline
   in taxonomic activity is creating. There is a serious shortage of
   trained systematists all over the world, but particularly in tropical
   countries where most of the world's diversity is located. A strong
   recommendation from the workshop is that support for training and
   research in systematics be increased, that systematic collections be
   upgraded and supported, and that more employment opportunities for
   systematists be created.}},

Abstract = {{The US Army Land Condition-Trend Analysis (LCTA) program is a
   standardized method of data collection, analysis, and reporting designed
   to meet multiple goals and objectives. The method utilizes vascular
   plant inventories, permanent field plot data, and wildlife inventories.
   Vascular plant inventories are used for environmental documentation,
   training of personnel, species identification during LCTA
   implementation, and as a survey for state and federal endangered or
   threatened species. The permanent field plot data documents the
   vegetational, edaphic, topographic, and disturbance characteristics of
   the installation. Inventory plots are allocated in a stratified random
   fashion across the installation utilizing a geographic information
   system that integrates satellite imagery and soil survey information.
   Ground cover, canopy cover. woody plant density, slope length, slope
   gradient, soil information, and disturbance data are collected at each
   plot. Plot data are used to: (1) describe plant communities, (2)
   characterize wildlife and threatened and endangered species habitat, (3)
   document amount and kind of military and nonmilitary disturbance, (4)
   determine the impact of military training on vegetation and soil
   resources, (5) estimate soil erosion potential, (6) classify land as to
   the kind and amount of use it can support, (7) determine allowable use
   estimates for tracked vehicle training, (8) document concealment
   resources, (9) identify lands that require restoration and evaluate the
   effectiveness of restorative techniques, and (10) evaluate potential
   acquisition Property. Wildlife inventories survey small and midsize
   mammals, birds, bats, amphibians, and reptiles. Data from these surveys
   can be used for environmental documentation, to identify state and
   federal endangered and threatened species, and to evaluate the impact Of
   military activities on wildlife populations. Short- and long-term
   monitoring of permanent field plots is used to evaluate and adjust land
   management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Western blot (WB) and electroimmunotransfer blot (EITB) methods were
   used to monitor bacterial soluble antigens and seroconversion profiles,
   respectively, in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., experimentally
   challenged with Renibacterium salmoninarum. The two challenged
   populations exhibited differences in susceptibility to R. salmoninarum
   permitting an evaluation of the methods in fish populations harbouring
   different levels of the pathogen. WB detection of R. salmoninarum
   soluble antigens in serum provided a sensitive method for detecting
   pathogen presence during the active infection stages. For comparison,
   results for drop-plate culture and direct fluorescent antibody
   techniques were obtained. During the recovery phase, surviving fish were
   negative for the pathogen by these methods. However, >90\% of challenged
   fish sampled from early infection stages to the end of the experimental
   period (141 days post-infection) were seropositive by the EITB assay for
   Atlantic salmon immunoglobulin reactive with R. salmoninarum soluble
   antigens. The results suggest that these methods for detecting R.
   salmoninarum or its soluble antigens may be useful during active
   infections. However, asymptomatic fish populations exposed to the
   pathogen, perhaps having recovered from all active infection and
   representing potential discase carrier sources. may be more readily
   identified by antigen-specific antibodies using methods such as the EITB
   assay.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored range-use patterns of 15 male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) orphaned as fawns (<12 months) and 19 males maturing with
   their mothers. Survivors were radiotracked until they were
   greater-than-or-equal-to 30-months old. Some males did not change their
   natal range, whereas others extended it, dispersed from it, or made
   occasional excursions. Dispersals could be classified as gradual
   short-distance or abrupt long-distance movements. Orphaned males
   maintained greater affinity for their natal ranges than did non-orphans,
   but had seasonal ranges that were larger on average until 18 months of
   age. Common use of range between non-orphans and their mothers ceased as
   males matured and all but one dispersed. The multiple-response
   permutation procedure successfully was used for the analysis of range
   fidelity over time or between individuals as an alternative to
   range-overlap estimates. The results support the hypothesis that
   dispersal evolved as a means to reduce the chance of inbreeding; the
   inclusive fitness of mothers may benefit most from dispersal of their
   male offspring, leading to a situation in which mothers force their male
   offspring to leave.}},

Abstract = {{During the austral winter of 1987 (June-August) at a semi-arid site in
   northcentral Chile, an outbreak of small mammals apparently was
   triggered by one episode of unusually high rainfall. From October 1987
   to November 1990, we monitored the outbreak on a monthly basis on two
   equatorial- and two polar-facing slopes. Overall density on
   equatorial-facing slopes was 239 individuals/ha in spring 1987,
   increasing to a peak of 404/ha by summer 1988, and then steadily
   declining to a crash of 20/ha (5\% of peak density) by spring 1990, with
   no signs of recovery. On polar-facing slopes, mammalian abundances were
   about one-half those of equatorial-facing slopes. There were 112
   individuals/ha in spring 1987, increasing to a peak of 199/ha by summer
   1988, and then steadily declining to a crash of 8/ha (4\% of peak
   density) by spring 1989. Since then, mammal populations on polar-facing
   slopes have been slowly recovering, reaching 11\% of their peak density
   by November 1990. Of the eight species monitored, only three irrupted:
   the granivorous cricetid Phyllotis darwini, the omnivorous cricetid
   Akodon olivaceus, and the insectivorous didelphid Marmosa elegans. These
   three irrupted and declined in phase, simultaneously on the two
   opposite-facing slopes, such that their relative frequencies did not
   shift markedly. Two of the three folivores (Abrocoma bennettii, Octodon
   degus, but not Chinchilla lanigera), one granivore (Oryzomys
   longicaudatus), and one insectivore (Akodon longipilis) disappeared from
   the site, persisting longer on equatorial-facing slopes.}},

Abstract = {{A review of mesozooplankton population densities and biomasses in the
   Gulf of Finland and northernmost Baltic Proper is presented based on
   monitoring data collected over the period 1968-1990 from four coastal
   and six open sea stations. Acartia bifilosa, Eurytemora affinis
   (Copepoda), Bosmina longispina maritima (Cladocera) and Synchaeta
   baltica (Rotifera) were found to be the most important species in the
   area. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analyses revealed several
   distinct biogeographical areas separated by their mesozooplankton
   community structures in most of the seasons. Salinity gradients and
   coastal-open-sea-gradient explained most of the differences between the
   communities. However, these factors did not explain the distribution of
   individual species in all cases. The possible role of other factors
   affecting the mesozooplankton distribution and abundance, such as
   eutrophication, is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons of the metabolic rates of species, populations, and
   treatment groups of animals are common. However, the data used in these
   comparisons may not be truly equivalent. We report the effects of
   varying (1) total time from which minimum metabolism is selected and (2)
   time over which metabolic rate is calculated (calculation interval) on
   estimates of oxygen consumption for Microtus agrestis and Apodemus
   sylvaticus. Oxygen consumption was measured at 10-degrees-C,
   20-degrees-C, and 30-degrees-C, using open-circuit respirometry. The
   lowest 15 min of metabolism were 13\% and 65\% higher for Microtus and
   Apodemus, respectively, when selected from a total monitoring period of
   30 min that when selected from a period of 6 h. This demonstrates the
   importance of standardizing the duration of time from which minimal
   estimates of metabolism are selected (i.e., the amount of time for which
   metabolism is measured). For Microtus, minimum oxygen consumption was
   12\% higher when calculated over 60 min than when calculated over 15
   min. We suggest that analyses relying on minimal (e.g.,basal) metabolic
   rates include calculation interval as a potential covariate.}},

Abstract = {{Sperm cells have been isolated from pollen of maize (Zea mays L.) and
   purified with Percoll density centrifugation. Their flow cytometric
   characteristics were determined on a FACScan flow cytometer with the
   fluorescent dyes, fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Freshly
   isolated sperm cells appeared as a dot cluster on the forward scatter
   and side scatter dot plot. This dot cluster contained 85 to 95\% of the
   10 thousand counts collected. More than 98\% of cells from the cluster
   were fluorescein diacetate positive, with no propidium iodide
   positivity, indicating high cell viability. After 5 hours in 15\% (w/v)

   number, and percentage of fluorescein diacetate-positive cells remained
   the same. In contrast, Brewbaker and Kwack salts in 15\% sucrose
   resulted in the emergence of a new cell population, as well as a
   decrease in cell number at 5 hours. Further investigations with
   individual components of the Brewbaker and Kwack salts showed that
   calcium was mainly responsible for the deleterious effects. These
   results demonstrate the utility of flow cytometry as a tool to determine
   viability and to monitor morphological changes of plant sperm cells and
   to challenge current views on the ability of Brewbaker and Kwack salts
   to maintain viability of isolated sperm cells.}},

Abstract = {{Serological surveys of common and grey seals were performed to monitor
   the spread of the phocid distemper outbreak in 1988 and its effects on
   the host immune response. The disease affected mainly common seals; grey
   seals were largely unaffected but did have anti-CDV antibodies which
   developed during 1988. Canadian seals, both common and grey, showed
   evidence of a morbillivirus infection but without the apparent mortality
   observed in British common seals. Common seal circulating immunoglobulin
   levels were not greatly affected during the outbreak, although there was
   some reduction in the most severely affected pups. Vaccination of common
   seals with CDV antigens elicited high titres of antibodies and produced
   clinical protection. Vertical transmission of host immunity was shown in
   grey seals although the longevity of protection has not been determined.
   The large population of common seals which are not immune emphasises
   that such an epizootic could have serious consequences again in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{In laboratory studies using albino house mice, a female's prior
   intrauterine position can affect many postnatal physiological,
   morphological and behavioral characteristics. Females flanked by males
   in utero (2 M females) exhibit more aggressive dominance than females
   flanked by females (0 M females). Thus, wild 2 M females may be most
   successful during peak population densities when their aggressive nature
   would allow them to displace other females from limited resources. 2 M
   and 0 M females and males delivered by cesarean section were
   individually marked and released as young adults on two occasions onto a
   ``highway island{''} (the area enclosed by exit and entrance ramps at an
   interchange) to determine whether 2 M females have a competitive
   advantage over 0 M females in the field. Males were included to create
   realistic population structure; their intrauterine position was not a
   treatment. Feeding stations afforded individuals an opportunity to
   exhibit their dominance by maintaining home-ranges at or near the
   stations. The populations were monitored by periodic live-trapping and
   reproductive success was determined using field body weights and by
   post-mortem examination for uterine implantation scars. Survival and
   capture rates were estimated, using a modified Jolly-Seber
   mark-recapture program, for each of four intervals between trapping
   occasions over the course of 7 weeks. There were no overall differences
   in survivorship between 2 M and 0 M females, neither type of female was
   caught more frequently at feeding stations and they did not differ in
   measures of reproductive success. However, 2 M females had significantly
   larger home-range sizes than 0 M females and thus space use may be a
   trait ``masculinized{''} by prior intrauterine position. Although there
   are a number of life-history characteristics that differ between 0 M and
   2 M females in the laboratory that we did not test specifically in the
   field, our findings and other features of wild house mouse biology
   suggest that prior intrauterine position does not have a strong effect
   on survival and reproduction in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{The larval release activity of the semi-terrestrial crab Sesarma pictum
   was monitored for three-week periods under laboratory conditions of
   constant and cyclic light. Under conditions of constant dim light, the
   rhythm for the first ten days was unimodal (larval release just after
   the nocturnal high tide) and then became bimodal (no apparent synchrony
   with the tides or with other members of the population) for the
   remainder of the experimental period. On the other hand, in photoperiods
   similar to those in the field, the rhythm was maintained; the phase was
   bimodal and the timing of larval release was delayed 1-2 h from the
   predicted times of high water in the habitat. When the photoperiod was
   advanced or delayed, the tidal rhythm was phase-shifted accordingly. The
   photoperiod does entrain the release rhythm to bimodal tidal cycle. So
   the phase-shift of a tidal rhythm by 24-h LD cycles is a very difficult
   phenomenon to explain.}},

Abstract = {{Mycelial fungi associated with leaves, flowers, and fruits of strawberry
   (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne) were monitored in a field plot from
   August 1986 to July 1987.  The principal fungi found on leaves of
   various developmental stages were Alternaria alternata, Botrytis
   cinerea, Cladosporium spp., Colletotrichum dematium, Coniella fragariae,
   Epicoccum purpurascens, Gliocladium roseum, Gloeosporium sp., Gnomonia
   comari, Penicillium spp., Trichothecium roseum, and Verticillium spp.  A
   majority of the fungi were observed more frequently on leaves that were
   washed and then plated on agar media than on leaves that were plated
   without washing.  Trichothecium roseum, however, was found mainly on the
   unwashed leaves.  Principal fungi on calyces, petals, and fruits were A.
   alternata, B. cinerea, Gloeosporium sp., Pencillium spp., T. roseum, and
   Verticillium spp.  Other fungi variously found on the flowers and fruits
   included Rhizopus stolonifer, Paecilomyces spp., C. dematium, and
   Fusarium spp.  Many of the fungi found frequently on the strawberry
   plants were present at most or all stages of development and decline of
   the various plant organs.  The mycofloral observations are discussed in
   relation to the biocontrol of strawberry diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The onset of sexual maturity and changes in weight and serum
   testosterone and cortisol concentrations were studied in male Weddell
   seals during October - December, 1986, at a breeding colony in McMurdo
   Sound, Antarctica. Ages were estimated from length or known from tagging
   history. Underwater copulatory and territorial activities were monitored
   by colored grease transfer and radiotelemetry, respectively. Hormone
   concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Of 37 male seals
   visiting the colony, 22 were resident for approximately 5 weeks. About
   one-third of the male residents defended territories into estrus and
   were called territorial (T). Another one-third appeared unsuccessful at
   defending a territory and were called transitional (TN). The remaining
   one-third were nonterritorial (N). Males were closely matched in size
   (coefficient of variation less-than-or-equal-to 15 \% for length, girth,
   and weight). Most N males were 5 - 7 years old. T males
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 7 years old), being older (P < 0.05) than N
   males, attained 19 of 20 observed copulations. T males were heavier
   initially (P < 0.10) than TN or N males, and they lost more weight
   during the breeding season (P = 0.08, 3.2 vs. 2.1 kg/day) than N males.
   In all males, serum testosterone and cortisol concentrations declined,
   approaching nadir as estrus and the breeding season ended. Mean (+/-SE)
   daily concentrations ranged from 6.8 +/- 2.4 ng/mL to nondetectable
   concentrations for testosterone and from 104.8 +/- 13.2 to 54.7 +/-
   4.5-mu-g/dL for cortisol. Concentrations of both hormones were higher in
   T males than in N males. Hormone profiles of TN males initially
   resembled those of T males, but at estrus resembled those of N males.
   Coincident with a change in competitive behavior was a transient rise in
   cortisol accompanied by a drop in testosterone.}},

   condition of 19 radio-collared arctic hares Lepus arcticus introduced to
   two predominantly (80\%) forested islands, Merchant (66.1 ha) and Burke
   (82.6 ha), in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. By late April, bone-marrow
   fat (42.7\%) and kidney fat indices were lower than found in populations
   on the mountain barrens of western Newfoundland. However, most island
   hares gained weight overwinter, and litter sizes (mean, 4.2 in utero)
   and testis weights (mean, 8.3 g) were as large or larger than recorded
   from other introduced and natural populations in Newfoundland. The
   distribution of telemetry locations, tracks and feeding sites indicated
   that hares frequented the scattered barrens (totalling c. 30 ha) on both
   islands in greater proportion than available. These results suggest
   that, in the absence of snowshoe hares and mammalian predators, forested
   regions interspersed with small patches of barrens can sustain arctic
   hares.}},

Abstract = {{Transects were run within Port Phillip Bay and off southern Phillip
   Island, Victoria, between February 1986 and November 1988 and Little
   Penguins Eudyptula minor counted. Details are given for group sizes and
   activities, and totals are considered in relation to the breeding cycle
   at Phillip Island. Numbers within Port Phillip Bay peaked between June
   and September, and in May and August off Phillip Island. Little Penguin
   totals within Port Phillip were negatively and significantly correlated
   with the number of birds coming ashore at Phillip Island, and with
   breeding indices there. Counts off the Island did not show such
   relationships. It is concluded that Little Penguins from Phillip Island
   complete their breeding, then moult, before moving into Port Phillip
   Bay. Most Little Penguins in Port Phillip Bay were seen in the eastern
   and northern areas sampled. This distribution, which complements that
   shown by banding and radio-tracking, may be related to availability of
   potential food species. Little Penguins may move into Port Phillip Bay
   when fish, particularly post-larval fish, are most abundant. Although
   food shortages have not caused major mortalities, increased commercial
   fishing has the potential to create problems. There is a need to monitor
   such harvests and to obtain better information on the populations of
   prey species.}},

   houses.  Mosquito relative density, species composition and the
   proportion of blood-fed females before and during the use of the Mbu
   cloth were monitored by hand catch, exit trap and CDC light trap
   catches.  The common mosquito species were Culex quinquefasciatus,
   Mansonia uniformis, Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and An. funestus.  A
   statistically significant decline in the mosquito population was
   observed following the introduction of the cloth.  The decline was
   particularly high during the first and second six month impregnation
   cycles when it ranged between 43 and 94\% indoors.  C. quinquefasciatus
   was less affected by the cloth than other species, while M. uniformis
   apparently avoided treated houses.  An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus
   were collected in extremely low numbers during the post-treatment
   period.  The Mbu cloth and other permethrin impregnated wall-hanging
   fabrics constitute a novel way of controlling mosquitoes and malaria in

Abstract = {{Light and pheromone trap networks were used to monitor and compare moth
   catches of Helicoverpa (= Heliothis) armigera (Hubner) in both types of

   light and pheromone trap catches were higher as compared to southern
   locations.  The traps located in the central part of India showed
   correlations, intermediate between those of northern and southern
   locations.  Pheromone traps were thus found suitable for monitoring at
   northern and central locations.  At southern locations, where light and
   pheromone trap catches differ considerably at different times of the
   year, both types of traps should be operated simultaneously for better
   monitoring of this insect.  Good correlations were found between larval

Abstract = {{The seasonal fruit-feeding behaviour of adults of Phlyctinus callosus in
   Granny Smith apple orchards, and the extent of the resultant crop loss
   was monitored on two farms during a number of successive seasons. Fruit
   feeding started at fruit set and reached maximum levels within 6 weeks.
   Thereafter, it abruptly decreased, even though there were still some 10
   weeks to harvest. Evidence indicates that the sudden decrease in
   fruit-feeding is due to a reduction in the functional value of adult
   mandibles caused by feeding. Renewed periods of fruit feeding on a
   smaller scale sometimes occurred in mid-season and shortly before
   harvest. These periods were closely related to periods of increased
   adult emergence. The dispersion pattern in the trees of fruit damaged by
   P. callosus was contagious, indicating aggregation behaviour during
   feeding by this species. The crop loss in apple orchards due to
   uncontrolled populations of P. callosus was very variable. Fruit damage
   between trees varied from less than 1 \% to 66 \%, and mean crop loss
   between seasons from 5 \% to 29 \%. Between 70 \% and 99 \% of fruit
   damage was caused during the first 3 months after fruit set. The
   implications of fruit feeding behaviour for the economic management of
   P. callosus are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Three types of experiments were conducted to assess the potential for
   enhancing the in situ biodegradation of nine aromatic hydrocarbons in
   anaerobic, leachate-impacted aquifers at North Bay, Ontario, and at
   Canada Forces Base Borden.
   Laboratory microcosms containing authentic aquifer material and
   groundwater from the North Bay site were amended with nitrate and
   glucose.  No significant losses of aromatic hydrocarbons were observed
   compared to unamended controls, over a period of 187 days.
   A total of eight in situ biodegradation columns were installed in the
   North Bay and Borden aquifers.  Remedial additions included electron
   acceptors (nitrate and sulphate) and primary substrates (acetate,
   lactate and yeast extract).  Six aromatic hydrocarbons {[}toluene,
   ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, cumene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene
   (1,2,4-TMB)] were completely degraded in at least one in situ column at
   the North Bay site.  Only toluene was degraded in the Borden aquifer. 
   In all cases, aromatic hydrocarbon attenuation was attributed to
   biodegradation by methanogenic and fermentative bacteria.  No evidence
   of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation was observed in columns remediated
   with nitrate or primary substrates.
   A continuous forced gradient injection experiment with sulphate addition
   was conducted at the North Bay site over a period of 51 days.  The
   concentration of six aromatic hydrocarbons was monitored over time in
   the injection wells and at piezometer fences located 2, 5 and 10 m
   downgradient.  All compounds except toluene reached injection
   concentration between 14 and 26 days after pumping began, and showed
   some evidence of selective retardation.  Toluene broke through at a
   subdued concentration (approximately 50\% of injection levels), and
   eventually declined to undetectable levels on day 43.  This attenuation
   was attributed to adaptation and biodegradation by anaerobic bacteria.
   The results from these experiments indicate that considerable anaerobic
   biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in landfill leachate plumes does
   occur.  The acclimatized population rapidly biodegraded toluene, much
   more rapidly than reported in other laboratory studies.  This
   biodegradation is selective, at least in the time frame of our
   experiments, with benzene and chlorobenzene remaining recalcitrant.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the potential use of salivary cadmium measurements for
   the biological monitoring of occupational cadmium exposure, paying
   particular attention to the contamination risks associated with such
   measurements. We have developed a method for the direct determination of
   cadmium in saliva by graphite furnace atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry, which minimizes the risk of contamination during
   sample preparation and analysis. The limit of detection is 0.6 nmoll-1,
   which is sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between unexposed and
   occupationally exposed individuals. The method has been employed to
   measure cadmium levels in saliva samples collected by two different
   methods from an unexposed population, a group of ex-workers previously
   exposed to cadmium (Group 1), and two groups of currently exposed
   workers (Groups 2 and 3). Salivary cadmium levels were significantly
   raised in both of the groups of currently exposed individuals (group 2
   median (Md)=17 nmoll-1, group 3 Md=70 nmoll-1. p>0.0001), and in past
   workers with previous long-term exposure (Group 1 Md=2.5 nmoll-1,
   p>0.001) when compared with an unexposed population. The results suggest
   that the measurement of salivary cadmium may reflect recent exposure to
   the metal. However, considerable care must be taken in collecting
   samples because a risk of contamination during sampling is apparent with
   procedures commonly used for saliva collection, and for this reason the
   applicability of such measurements for biological monitoring is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation models are used to solve various problems in stored-grain
   management. Temperature and moisture content of stored grain are
   simulated to evaluate the efficacy of ambient air ventilation and to
   estimate the maximum safe storage period of grain. Population dynamics
   and bioenergetics of stored-grain insects and mites are simulated to
   estimate the risk of pest outbreaks. Degradation of pesticide is
   simulated to evaluate its efficacy. These individual simulation models
   will be organized into a granary-ecosystem model to simulate the
   dynamics of the ecosystem. Simulation models can be used as parts of an
   expert system to optimize granary management.
   A regional model is being developed to predict pest infestations in farm
   granaries on the Canadian prairies to help local extension personnel
   warn farmers of potential infestations, and recommend intensive
   monitoring of their grain and proper management actions. The regional
   model would use the granary-ecosystem model along with regional
   estimations of initial storage conditions based on meteorological and
   other databases. A method to estimate the temperature and moisture
   content of freshly harvested grain from a meteorological database is
   being developed.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the migratory patterns of mule deer (Odocoileus
   hemionus hemionus) is essential when defining populations and helps
   wildlife managers select appropriate management strategies.  During
   1985-89, I used radio telemetry to study movements and migration
   patterns of mule deer in southeastern Idaho.  Migration between summer
   and winter ranges averaged 19.7 km and did not differ (P > 0.05) between
   sexes.  Twenty-six percent of the marked deer were not migratory.  Deer
   from 1 summer range migrated to 6 discrete winter ranges, and the
   overall migration pattern formed a complex web among the winter and
   summer ranges.  Deer showed high fidelity to summer ranges; 100\% of the
   females (n = 27) and 92\% of the males (n = 12) used the same summer
   range during each year they were monitored.  Fidelity to winter ranges
   was lower than for summer ranges.  Distances traveled between centers of
   activity during successive winters averaged 1.4 km (n = 38 deer) and did
   not differ (P > 0.05) between males (n = 12) and females (n = 26). 
   During 2 relatively mild winters, 48\% and 19\% of marked migratory deer
   did not use winter range habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of band recoveries for hunted populations of birds provide
   information on the hunting pressure to which the population is subject;
   yet little is known about these patterns in lesser snow geese (Chen
   caerulescens caerulescens).  Consequently, we compared recovery patterns
   for lesser snow geese nesting at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba (LPB) and Cape
   Henrietta Maria, Ontario (CHM) between 1970 and 1979 to test whether
   geese from both colonies followed the same migration routes and
   experienced the same hunting pressure.  Relatively few geese from LPB
   were recovered along Hudson Bay, but large numbers were recovered in
   southern Manitoba and North Dakota.  In contrast, geese from CHM were
   recovered in large numbers around James Bay, but then most appeared to
   migrate directly to stopover sites along the Missouri River.  Further
   south, recovery distributions from both colonies were similar, but geese
   from CHM tended to be recovered further east than those from LPB,
   particularly on the Gulf Coast.  Within each colony, blue phase geese
   migrated further east than white geese, but differences were small
   compared with intercolony differences.  Overall, direct recovery rates
   for adults banded at CHM were about 40\% lower (P < 0.0001) than those
   from LPB, but survival rates were similar (LPB = 82\%, CHM = 83\%, P =
   0.6).  The lower reported harvest of geese from CHM may be partly
   balanced by a larger unreported harvest by Cree Indians around James
   Bay.  Both survival and recovery rates for individual breeding colonies
   need to be carefully monitored for optimal management in view of recent
   population changes.}},

Abstract = {{Beach surveys of persistent litter were carried out on Sable Island,
   Canada, between 31 May 1984 and 10 September 1986, with supplementary
   observations to early 1991. Persistent litter found on Sable beaches
   comes from the ocean, and does not originate on the island itself.
   Deposition rates were fairly consistent from year to year, site to site,
   with some seasonal variation. A total of 11 183 persistent litter items
   were collected and sorted, representing 219 items/km/month. Ninety-two
   per cent of this total was plastic material. Types of litter found
   include tampon dispensers, polystyrene cups and packing materials.
   plastic containers for food, oil and cleansers, polyethylene bags and
   sheet, liquor and soft drink bottles, fluorescent tubes and incandescent
   bulbs, plastic strapping, polypropylene rope, and large amounts of
   fishing equipment. These items are generated by various marine
   activities, particularly the fishing industry. Entanglement of two
   species of seal and three species of seabird, and ingestion of plastic
   and latex by leatherback turtles, was observed. While litter in Scotian
   Shelf waters presents hazards to all marine animals, it does not appear
   to have a serious impact on seal populations at this time.}},

Abstract = {{The responses of unmated female New World screwworm flies, Cochliomyia
   hominivorax Coquerel, to visual targets were studied in a wind-tunnel.
   Both activity and frequency of contacts with targets increased greatly
   when the screwworm attractant mixture swormlure-4 was added to the
   airstream. Target-orientated responses depended on target colour, with
   red and black targets being preferred over blue, white and yellow ones;
   this preference was much greater in the presence of odour than in its
   absence. No preference was detected for different shapes and
   orientations of red targets, all of equivalent surface area. Omitting
   different components from swormlure-4 generally resulted in a large
   reduction in activation and target contacts. Attempts to substitute
   1-octen-3-ol for the butanol fraction were unsuccessful, but skatole may
   substitute to some extent for indole; the two isomers of butanol
   normally present in swormlure-4 may substitute partly or completely for
   each other. This type of measurement forms a suitable bioassay in the
   development of attractive targets for monitoring and control of wild
   adult screwworm populations.}},

Abstract = {{Swards of 10 pasture species (six grasses and four legumes) were
   established and planted with seeds of either of the thistle species
   Carduus nutans L. or Cirsium vulgare L., and emergence and growth of the
   thistle seedlings were subsequently monitored.  Emergence of C. nutans
   seedlings was inhibited by ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Yorkshire
   fog (Holcus lanatus L.) swards, while C. vulgare emergence was inhibited
   by Yorkshire fog relative to some of the other treatments.  Speed of
   emergence of C. nutans and absolute emergence of C. vulgare seedlings
   were significantly negatively correlated with pasture cover density,
   presumably as a consequence of alteration of light quality by the
   pasture swards.  All pasture species inhibited seedling shoot and root
   growth of both thistle species, although the grasses were the most
   effective inhibitors.  The seedling emergence and growth data for C.
   nutans in the swards of the 10 species were significantly correlated
   with the results of a previous study on residual allelopathic effects of
   the same 10 species on nodding thistle root growth.  It is concluded
   that inhibitory (including allelopathic) influences of pasture species
   on thistle seedlings have considerable potential as a mechanism for
   managing problematic thistle populations.}},

Title = {{BIOGEOCHEMISTRY AND EFFECTS OF COPPER, MANGANESE AND ZINC ADDED TO
   ENCLOSURES IN ISLAND BILLABONG, MAGELA CREEK, NORTHERN AUSTRALIA}},
Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{230}},

Abstract = {{Three large plastic enclosures (5 m diam, volume 40 m3) were used to
   study the effects of copper, manganese and zinc. on the phytoplankton
   community in Island billabong, a floodplain billabong (waterhole)
   situated in the Magela Creek in tropical northern Australia. Copper was
   added to one enclosure, and manganese and zinc to another, to give
   initial concentrations around ten times the normal wet season Values.
   The enclosures and the billabong were monitored over a ten week period
   towards the end of the dry season, with the enclosures allowed to
   stabilise for four weeks before the metals were added.
   The control enclosure adequately simulated the temperature and pH
   changes in the billabong. The trends in conductivity, dissolved oxygen
   and major ion concentrations were similar in the enclosure and the
   billabong, with the minor differences observed attributed to either
   epiphytic growth on the enclosure walls (influenced dissolved oxygen, pH
   and bicarbonate concentration) or ingress of sulphate-rich groundwater
   into the billabong (influenced sulphate concentration and conductivity).
   Major differences in both the composition of species and the size of the
   phytoplankton populations were observed between the three enclosures and
   between the control enclosure and the billabong. This variability
   reflects the great natural variability in the phytoplankton communities
   in tropical lentic systems, and means that enclosures are unlikely to
   adequately simulate the biological communities in the billabongs.
   The control enclosure appeared to simulate quite well the longer term
   changes in total concentration and speciation of the three metals
   (copper, manganese \& zinc) in the billabong. The mean concentrations of
   copper and zinc were similar in the two systems, although the mean
   concentration of manganese in the billabong was almost double that in
   the enclosure, possibly due to ingress of manganese-enriched
   groundwater. Particulate forms dominated the speciation of copper and
   manganese. There was considerable short term variation in both total
   metal concentration and speciation in both the enclosure and the
   billabong. This variability appears to be a feature of these small
   tropical waterbodies.
   The added heavy metals were found to have minimal detrimental effect on
   the phytoplankton community in each metal-loaded enclosure. The high
   natural variability in the phytoplankton community in these tropical
   systems will make it difficult to separate natural changes from those
   caused by low level contamination from mining operations should this
   occur.
   All three metals were rapidly removed from the water column, so that by
   the end of the six week period, only ca. 5\% of each added metal
   remained in the water column. Association with the particulate matter
   (phytoplankton. abiotic particulate matter and MnO(x) in enclosure 2)
   followed by sedimentation was the major removal pathway. Epiphytes
   growing on the enclosure walls appeared to have a minor influence (<
   10\% of the total amount of metal added) on the removal of the added
   metals. For copper, uptake by phytoplankton followed by sedimentation
   was the major (65 \%) removal process. Manganese and zinc, added
   together, were found to influence each other. The major manganese
   removal process (60\%) was rapid (ca. 3 days) involving bacterial
   oxidation and sedimentation of the MnO(x) formed. This material appeared
   to have little influence on the behaviour of zinc, possibly because
   other particulate matter competed more effectively for the zinc. A
   further 30\% of the added manganese was removed via initial adsorption
   to other particulate matter, possibly phytoplankton. Approximately one
   third of this adsorbed manganese (10\% of the total added) appeared to
   undergo delayed oxidation some 8 days after the initial additions, and
   the heavier particles settled out more rapidly. This path was
   responsible for removing the major amount (ca. 60\%) of the added zinc.
   We hypothesis that the sorbed zinc inhibited the bacterial oxidation of
   the manganese. A further 25\% of the zinc was removed in association
   with a `burst' of phytoplankton activity. The occurrence of bursts in
   the phytoplankton activity, when populations can increase verv
   substantially and then decrease again, all within the space of a day,
   appears to be an important mechanism for removing copper and zinc from
   the water column in these tropical water bodies.}},

Abstract = {{We used DNA fingerprinting to determine paternity of 80 calves born into
   the individually monitored population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) on
   the Isle of Rum, Scotland. Using the paternity information, we
   investigated the assumptions and predictions of behavioral estimates of
   male mating success, on which previous studies in this population have
   relied. Over an 11-day interval in the rut centered on a female's
   estimated date of conception, the probability that a male fathers a calf
   is closely related to the number of days he holds the female in his
   harem, increasing from 0.12 for 1 day to 1.0 for 6 days or more. We
   compared three methods for estimating the reproductive success of
   individual males from field observations of harem membership with true
   success revealed by DNA fingerprinting. All three methods accurately
   identified the relative success of individual males but were poor
   predictors of absolute success: the behavioral methods underestimate the
   true success of successful males and overestimate the success of many
   males who, in fact, fail to father any calves. In consequence, variance
   in male mating success is greater than previous behavioral estimates for
   this population suggested. Both harem membership data and observations
   of mating and other estrous behavior can be used to identify males most
   likely to father a specific calf.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effect of acute exposure to the organophosphate
   pesticide, chlorpyrifos, on genetic structure of freshwater shrimps.
   Genotype frequencies at two enzyme loci, Pgi and Pgm, were examined.
   There were significant differences in genotype frequencies between
   tolerant and susceptible animals in some experiments and not in others.
   This suggests that the differential tolerance occurs only at some
   concentrations or in some populations due to different linkage
   relationships between populations. The potential for using this method
   for monitoring pollution impacts is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Larval parasitism of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), was monitored in
   11 study plots in northern New Jersey from 1978 to 1988. Five parasitoid
   species were commonly found. Parasitism by Cotesia melanoscelus
   (Ratzeburg) was highest at the peak of egg mass density during a gypsy
   moth outbreak. Phobocampe unicincta (Gravenhorst) had low and relatively
   constant parasitism levels through the outbreak, but parasitism fell
   near zero after the host population crashed. Parasitism by Compsilura
   concinnata Meigen peaked during the decline of gypsy moth populations
   and probably was related primarily to the presence of alternate hosts.
   Parasetigena silvestris (Robineau-Desvoidy) had the highest levels of
   parasitism overall. Levels remained high throughout the outbreak and
   declined with the host populations. Parasitism by Blepharipa pratensis
   (Meigen) was highest in the first year of the study, when egg mass
   density was increasing, and declined steadily thereafter, following the
   trend of host larval density. Parasitism by all species except C.
   concinnata was correlated significantly and positively with the density
   of host larvae. Three species showed delayed density dependence. Direct
   density dependence, density independence, or indeterminate density
   relationships were observed for all species across study plots within
   seasons. The relationship of parasitism to ecological factors was
   investigated through stepwise multiple regression analysis. Parasitism
   by C. melanoscelus was correlated primarily with winter and spring
   temperatures and gypsy moth egg mass density. For P. unicincta
   parasitism, most variation was explained by parasitism by C.
   melanoscelus and stand density. Parasitism by C. concinnata was
   correlated most strongly with stand composition and percentage infection
   by gypsy moth nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Percentage defoliation of oaks
   explained most variation in parasitism by P. silvestris and R pratensis.

Abstract = {{A classification system for coding the habitats of British and Irish
   birds has been designed for use in `extensive' ecological studies, i.e.
   where data are contributed by many observers.  The system is based
   mainly on the vegetation structure of habitats and requires no expert
   botanical knowledge.  It has advantages over several existing habitat
   classifications because it embraces agricultural and man-made sites as
   well as semi-natural ones, and it also includes aspects of
   land-management and human activity.  The system described in this paper
   has, however, been designed to be as fully compatible as possible with
   other widely-used classifications.  It has been implemented within the
   BTO Nest Record Scheme and its use will be extended throughout the BTO's
   Integrated Population Monitoring Programme.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1961 the Northumbria Ringing Group has monitored a population of
   Merlins breeding in Kielder Forest, Northumberland.  Prior to 1979
   Merlins bred at traditionally used sites mostly on the ground in
   Heather.  In 1979 the first nest was located in a crows' nest along the
   moorland edge of a young Sitka Spruce plantation.  This nesting habit
   has increased, and by 1990 over 50\% of the population were breeding in
   crows' nests in conifers.  This switch in the type of nest sites has
   coincided with large areas of forests reaching an age suitable for crows
   to nest in.  Merlins breeding in conifer forests had similar clutch
   sizes to those using traditional ground nests, but in conifer sites,
   brood sizes were 70\% larger.  Throughout the course of this study
   (1978-90) the Merlin population increased by 71\% to 24 pairs in 1990. 
   A low point was reached in 1982/83 when only 10-11 pairs bred, after
   this tree-nesting increased and so did the population.}},

Abstract = {{Two strains of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), resistant to synthetic
   pyrethroids, were isolated from field populations collected in the
   irrigated cotton growing areas of northern New South Wales: an isofemale
   strain, Mfo, and a composite field strain, Field. A series of crosses
   were undertaken between the Mfo and susceptible strains to determine the
   genetic basis of the resistance. Dose-responses were obtained by
   bioassay using topical application of fenvalerate in acetone.
   Considerable variation in tolerance was observed in both resistant and
   susceptible strains. In the Mfo strain, the major shift in resistance
   phenotype (33-fold resistance) was due to a single major gene with
   incomplete dominance. The resistance phenotype was not diluted by 23
   generations of backcrossing. The major resistance phenotype could be
   eliminated almost completely by the addition of piperonyl butoxide which
   affects oxidative breakdown of the pyrethroids by mixed function oxidase
   (mfo) enzymes. Similar results were observed in the Field strain.
   Monitoring for resistance in field populations will be imprecise because
   a true discriminating dose does not exist for susceptible and
   heterozygous resistant individuals.}},

   shelters are recommended as they are both inexpensive and durable. 
   Shelters were compared with three-crown-level larval sampling and with
   pheromone trapping.  Cocoon counts from shelters were significantly
   correlated with same-year larval density, reflecting larval sample
   differences between ridges and the general trend in plots along ridges. 
   Egg masses from shelters in 1978 were significantly correlated with the
   next year's larval counts, and are of potential value as an early
   predictor of larval population.  The shelter method also provides
   information on adult sex ratio and pupal and egg emergence, parasitism,
   and predation.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of basic smoltification characteristics, measured by means
   of seasonal changes in rheotactic behaviour and seawater adaptability,
   was studied from February to November in 1- and 2-yr-old landlocked
   Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus).  Up- and downstream directed movements
   were monitored in an annular stream tank at a water velocity of 0.2 m/s.
   A 48-h seawater challenge test using 25\% seawater was performed at
   monthly intervals throughout the year to assess seawater adaptability. 
   The 1-yr-old char displayed mainly nondirectional behaviour during
   spring, but from August onwards the movements were predominantly against
   the current.  Seawater performance improved slightly in this group in
   May and June.  The 2-yr-old char progressively developed a downstream
   behaviour and exhibited an increased seawater adaptability during spring
   and early summer.  In late August, a marked reversal in rheotactic
   behaviour occurred, followed by a rapid decrease in seawater tolerance. 
   The results demonstrate that seasonal changes in seawater adaptability
   and changes in migratory behaviour which were directionally consistent
   with smolting still exist in a population of Arctic char that has been
   landlocked for about 6000 yr.}},

Abstract = {{Annual organic matter inputs and production of stocked coho salmon
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch), coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarki clarki), and
   shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus) from spring through early autumn
   were monitored for 2 yr in two headwater tributaries of the Deschutes
   River, Washington.  One site was bordered by old-growth coniferous
   forest; the other was an area clear-cut without buffer strips 7 yr
   before the study.  Allochthonous organic matter (terrestrial origin)
   dominated inputs to the old-growth site and contributed approximately
   300 g.m-2.yr-1, while autochthonous organic matter totaled approximately
   100 g.m-2.yr-1.  In the clear-cut site, autochthonous inputs contributed
   approximately 175 g.m-2.yr-1, but allochthonous inputs contributed only
   approximately 60 g.m-2.yr-1 owing to loss of riparian vegetation. 
   Although combined allochthonous and autochthonous inputs were almost
   twofold greater in the old-growth site, fish production was greater in
   the clear-cut site.  Production of coho salmon and shorthead sculpin
   during early summer was largely responsible for differences between
   sites.  Fish populations appeared to depend upon food derived from
   autotrophic pathways during spring and summer in the presence or absence
   of forest canopy, a hypothesis supported by analysis of coho stomach
   contents and the similar ratios of autochthonous inputs and fish
   production between the two streams.}},

Abstract = {{Export of aquarium-fish from the Maldives began in 1980 and in 1989
   almost 54,000 marine fishes, worth approximately US\$ 130,000, were
   exported. The collection of aquarium species is confined to a relatively
   small area around the capital island, Male. Estimates of annual exports
   of 95 species were obtained by examining packing-lists held by Maldivian
   Customs. In parallel, the population densities of about 70 aquarium-fish
   species were estimated by visual assessment. Using a number of
   assumptions, potential (maximum sustainable) yields for 65 of these
   species - those for which export data were available - were estimated
   for the area (530 km2) within a 13-km radius (one hour's journey by
   local boat) of Male.
   For 27 species there were some reasons for concern about the levels of
   exploitation, although only 12 of these species appeared to be `at risk'
   in 1986 (the year of highest exploitation). If the assumptions made in
   estimating potential sustainable yields were valid, these 12
   aquarium-fish species were being overexploited or exploited at levels
   close to maximum sustainable yields. Should the trade expand threefold,
   a further 12 species are considered to be potentially at risk of
   overexploitation. Two species of butterflyfish, Chaetodon meyeri and C.
   triangulum, which feed exclusively on coral polyps and generally die in
   captivity after a short time, were being exported in significant
   numbers. Both clownfishes (Amphiprion spp.) and their host sea-anemones
   were being heavily exploited. Because of the symbiotic relationship
   between these fishes and their anemone homes, this group may be
   particularly susceptible to overexploitation.
   Damage to branching corals may result from the collection of specimens
   of Dascyllus aruanus, which shelter within them. With many thousands of
   individuals of this species being exported each year, this could
   represent considerable collateral coral damage. Although levels of
   exploitation of `cleaner wrasses' (Labroides bicolor and L. dimidiatus)
   appear well below potentially sustainable ones, it is unclear whether
   the health of reef fishes might locally be adversely affected in heavily
   exploited areas.
   Monitoring and regulation of the aquarium-fish trade is discussed,
   together with the need for collection of catch statistics by those
   involved in the trade. The importance of regulation of collection
   techniques, of standards of facilities, and of satisfactory packaging of
   fish for export, is stressed. If more accurate estimates of sustainable
   yields are to be obtained, there needs to be monitoring of populations
   of key aquarium-fish species in designated collecting areas where
   exploitation levels are known. Until such estimates become available,
   the cautious approach adopted in the Maldives to estimate yields and set
   species-based quotas will, it is hoped, prevent local overexploitation.}},

Abstract = {{The Russian River-Cooper Lake-Resurrection River trail system, on the
   Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, traverses essential brown bear habitat.  To set
   management guidelines for this area, the trail system was monitored
   using questionnaire cards and electronic trail counters from 1984
   through 1987.  This helped to determine the extent and type of human use
   and human-bear encounters in the area.  Management recommendations were
   intended to reduce the potential displacement of brown bears by hikers
   and to inform wilderness users of the proper camping techniques to avoid
   attracting bears to the campsite.  An average of 5800 visitors hiked or
   camped along the trail system each year.  Encounters between hikers and
   brown bears averaged 7/yr while encounters with black bears averaged
   35/yr.  Minor problems occurred with both the electronic trail counters
   and the questionnaire.  Modifications to these methods are discussed.  A
   Limits of Acceptable Change format should be considered for the trail
   system to determine the character and future direction of recreational
   activities and monitoring of the trail system should continue in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Projected decreases in rates of population growth, an aging population,
   and an increase in minority residents will affect the demand for sport
   fishing with implications for management.  Age and
   race/ethnicity-specific projections of the U.S. population and of
   participation in fishing are used to examine the impacts of future
   demographic trends on the number and characteristics of anglers. 
   Results suggest that the rate of increase in the angler population will
   decline, the population will become older, and the population will have
   larger minority components.  These changes may require increased
   services for elderly and minority residents at a time when they are
   exempt from license fees or require lower access costs, respectively. 
   As their numbers increase, older age and minority groups are likely to
   enjoy greater political power.  Managers are likely to find themselves
   forced to address the needs of these groups in more direct and visible
   ways than had previously been required.  This will require managers to
   investigate new sources of program funding and rethink the exemption to
   licensing requirements for individuals aged 65 and older.  The
   monitoring of future demographic trends is essential to effective
   management.}},

   adult sand flies were collected in light traps supplemented with dry
   ice; less-than-or-equal-to 1\% were aspirated from diurnal resting
   sites. Adult sand flies first appeared in April and were followed by
   peaks of abundance during May 1986, and May and July 1987. Numbers of
   adults captured fell rapidly in October and November 1986 and in
   September and October 1987. No specimens were collected in December 1986
   or in March, November, and December 1987. Light trap catch was affected
   positively by mean nightly air temperature and negatively by rainfall 14
   d before collection, but not by wind speed or moon phase. Vesicular
   stomatitis viral activity, as measured by antibodies in feral and
   domestic swine, roughly corresponded to the seasonal appearance of adult
   L. shannoni during 1986 and 1987. Significantly more adults (72\%) were
   collected in light traps at ground level (0.5 m) than at heights of 4
   and 8 m. Most resting adults were collected from dark, moist tree holes

Abstract = {{Aedes albopictus has been found in 53 of the 67 Florida counties.  The
   initial discoveries in 11 of these counties were made in cemetries.  At
   several locations, Ae. albopictus became well-established in cemeteries
   before appearing in nearby accumulations of waste tires.  The recycling
   of plastic floral baskets may be aiding the spread of Ae. albopictus. 
   Mosquitoes were commonly found in all types of flower-holding containers
   in cemeteries, except bronze vases.  In the laboratory, most Aedes
   aegypti eggs laid in bronze vases hatched, but larvae subsequently died.
   The spread of Ae. albopictus in cemeteries seems to occur at the expense
   of Ae. aegypti populations.  At one cemetery immature Ae. albopictus and
   Ae. aegypti were found in about 70\% of the Aedes-positive containers at
   the start of a monitoring program.  In subsequent collections from this
   site, Ae. albopictus was found in nearly all Aedes-positive containers,
   whereas there was a progressive decrease in containers with Ae. aegypti.
   This trend did not appear to be the result of any seasonal pattern
   because in a nearby cemetery where Ae. albopictus was absent, Ae.
   aegypti did not show a similar decline.  Limiting flower-holding
   containers to those with drain holes or to bronze vases would greatly
   limit mosquito production.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity, resolution, and sample rate of optical particle
   monitors, counters and spectrometers are described.  Important
   differences in conceptual design of each instrument class are detailed. 
   Optical particle counters and spectrometers require uniform sample
   volume illumination and have been used in monitoring aerosol
   microcontamination for many years.  Spectrometers have the highest
   resolution and the greatest number of size channels.  Counters may have
   high intrinsic resolution but it is lost because of the fewer number of
   size channels provided.
   Monitors are a relatively new class of instrument which do not provide
   uniform sample volume illumination.  They are becoming widely used in
   liquid monitoring.  Monitors are simpler, less expensive devices and are
   characterized as having poor resolution but providing the highest sample
   flow rates and delivering the largest database.  When used on fluids
   with normal populations having an exponential size distribution,
   monitors show little size distribution distortion.  When modal
   populations or deviations from exponential size distributions are
   encountered, counters or spectrometers are required.  Filter penetration
   tests generally demand the highest resolution offered only by
   spectrometers.
   Data are presented from field visits to 17 semiconductor plants having
   deionized (D.I.) water processing facilities where monitors and
   spectrometers were used simultaneously to characterize water quality. 
   The data set provides an interesting comparison within the industry as
   well as an opportunity to compare the low-resolution monitors with
   high-resolution spectrometers under field conditions.}},

   After collection, the tadpoles were placed in 25-degrees-C tanks with
   long (16L:8D), short (8L:16D), and natural photoperiods. Developmental
   stages (Taylor-Kollros) were assessed at approximately 3-d intervals,
   and temperature selection at approximately 1-wk intervals. For the first
   2 wk in the 25-degrees-C tanks, development was rapid (0. 4 stages. d-1)
   in early and midsummer but very slow (0.02 stages. d-1) in early winter.
   During this initial 2-wk period, the temperatures selected in early and
   midsummer (28.4-degrees-C) were higher than those selected in early
   winter (24.0-degrees-C). After 2 wk in the 25-degrees-C tanks, the
   long-photoperiod group (relative to the short-photoperiod group) showed
   a slight decrease in development in early summer, no difference in
   midsummer, and a definite increase in early winter. Temperature
   selection was not altered by photoperiod length. These results suggest
   that endogenous annual rhythms for development and temperature selection
   are present in Rana catesbeiana tadpoles.}},

Abstract = {{The adult sizes and reproductive capabilities of populations of the
   cladoceran Daphniopsis studeri Ruhe from freshwater and slightly saline
   lakes in the Vestfold Hills, Princess Elizabeth Land were monitored
   during December, 1990.  The population of Crooked Lake was studied in
   detail from July 1990 - March 1991.  Limited samples were also obtained
   from Heard Island (sub-Antarctic).  Obligate parthenogenesis involving
   the production of subitaneous eggs appears to be the case.  No males
   occurred.  The overwintering populations of continental Antarctica
   consist mainly of adult females containing extensive fat reserves.  The
   main reproductive effort occurs in spring, some females produce a
   smaller second brood during the summer.  Reproductive output increases
   with adult size which is related to the nutrient status of the lake and
   its productivity.  The Heard Island populations have a higher weight to
   length ratio than the Vestfold populations and have a much greater
   reproductive output.}},

Abstract = {{Soil samples in which cellulose sheets were inserted were incubated at
   30-degrees-C under flooded conditions.  The fungicide trichlamide,
   (RS)-N-(1-butoxy-2,2,2-trichloroethyl) salicylamide, was applied to the
   soils as a representative pesticide with an inhibitory effect on the
   microflora related to cellulose decomposition.  The cellulose
   decomposition, the changes in the populations of aerobic microorganisms
   in soil and the redox potential were monitored during the incubation. 
   The microorganisms which colonized the cellulose sheets were observed
   microscopically.
   When the microflora was affected by the pesticide, cellulose
   decomposition was inhibited, colonization of the cellulose sheets by
   some microorganisms was not observed, and the development of the
   reductive conditions in the flooded soil was retarded.  When the
   microflora on the cellulose sheets was not affected by the pesticide, no
   inhibitory effect on the cellulose decomposition was observed, and the
   reduction process was not appreciably retarded.
   These results suggested that the insertion of cellulose sheets in
   flooded soil samples combined with the microscopic observation of the
   cellulose sheets may afford a suitable model of the soil ecosystem to
   evaluate the effect of pesticides on the interaction among the
   cellulolytic activity, the microflora and the soil conditions
   represented by the redox potential.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored spatial distribution of nests of green turtles, Chelonia
   mydas, for three years at Tortuguero, Costa Rica.  The beach was divided
   into three zones from water's edge to supralittoral vegetation depending
   on the extent of vegetation cover.  The extent of shade affects the
   temperature of the nest and, ultimately, the sex of the offspring in
   that nest through environmental sex determination.  Patterns of nest
   distribution among beach zones within and among years were evaluated
   both for the population and for individual turtles.  Distribution of
   nests among the three zones varied among years.  Individual turtles that
   nested three or more times within a season more often deposited clutches
   in more than one zone than in just one zone.  Individual green turtles
   are more likely to conform to the population's pattern of nest
   distribution each year than to maintain their own individual pattern
   between years.  Thus, annual factors apparently have a greater effect on
   nest placement than do individual nesting patterns.  The lack of any
   consistent pattern of nest distribution may result from environmental
   uncertainty and low predictability of nest success.  Because patterns of
   nest placement are not consistent either for the population or for
   individuals, we predict that primary sex ratios will vary from year to
   year for both the Tortuguero population and for the offspring of
   individual turtles.  The distribution of nests of hawkbills,
   Eretmochelys imbricata, at Tortuguero within each year is not different
   from that of the green turtle.}},

   25 mites per leaflet whereas 91\% of the fields that received more than
   two sprays had that number of mites. There was evidence that pyrethroid
   insecticides caused sharp increases in mite numbers. Numbers of
   fungicide applications also tended to correlate with mite numbers but
   this was probably because growers who used insecticides liberally
   usually also used fungicides liberally.}},

Abstract = {{Heteropsyllus nunni is a marine copepod that builds a cyst and dwells
   within it during a period of extended diapause. The field abundance of
   this copepod has been monitored for 10 years, but nothing is known about
   the cues that induce and terminate encystment. In the laboratory,
   different photoperiods and temperatures were tested for their effects on
   encystment and excystment.
   The photoperiod and temperature cues tested neither induced nor
   inhibited encystment in H. nunni. Encystment occurred in all treatments,
   regardless of temperature or photoperiod, suggesting that internal
   genetic cues, tied to a specific ontogenetic stage, must be the central
   causal factor. Copepods in the hot treatments encysted and excysted more
   rapidly than in the cold. Many copepods in the cold treatment encysted
   (though later than copepods in the hotter treatments), and most were
   still within the cyst at the end of the 23-week experiment. There were
   significantly more males within the full cysts than females. A
   concurrent field study confirmed the known seasonal patterns in the
   number of encystments relative to the number of free-living forms; i.e.,
   encystment took place in the summer.}},

Abstract = {{Movement patterns of fifth-instar Hydropsyche slossonae larvae were
   investigated in artificial streams.  In the first choice experiment,
   larvae were released into a central area and their upstream or
   downstream crawling or drifting was monitored.  A second experiment used
   the same design; however, fifth instars collected during spring and fall
   were divided into two, nonoverlapping, relative size-classes (large and
   small) to determine how these factors influenced movement parameters. 
   In both experiments, larvae always drifted more frequently than they
   crawled, but in experiment 2, drifting tendency declined with increasing
   weight in spring.  In both experiments, there was no statistically
   detectable directional bias to crawling nor change in relative crawling
   direction with season or size-class.  In experiment 2, drifting larvae
   were lighter than nondrifting larvae in the large size-class, but equal
   in weight in the small size-class.  This result was unrelated to
   absolute weight, as large size-class larvae in fall were similar in
   weight to small size-class larvae in spring.  It is possible that the
   relative weight differential of drifting and nondrifting larvae in one
   size-class but not the other may be related to sexual rather than body
   size differences.}},

Abstract = {{Colony attendance by Least Auklets (Aethia pusilla) was monitored during
   three breeding seasons at St. Paul Island, Alaska. Maximum counts of
   birds attending one 150-m2 study plot varied significantly from year to
   year, with a nearly two-fold difference between highest and lowest
   years. Maximum numbers on the surface at any one time amounted to about
   half of the local breeding population. Attendance was high in the year
   with greatest proportion of adults breeding, low in the year with lowest
   proportion of adults breeding, and the proportion of adults breeding
   differed significantly among years. Adult attendance both early and late
   in breeding season differed significantly among years, but there was no
   evidence that varying attendance related to changes in the overall adult
   population. Counts during incubation and chick-rearing stages were
   affected by sub-adults (two-year-olds), which differed significantly in
   attendance from year to year and sometimes represented up to half the
   birds on the colony surface. Year-to-year changes in surface counts
   probably related to strength of this sub-adult cohort and to varying
   attendance behavior of adults and sub-adults that correlated with food
   availability. These data suggest that. taken alone, surface counts at
   Least Auklet colonies must be interpreted cautiously in assessing
   population changes. Suggestions for improvement of counting techniques
   and an alternative approach to population monitoring are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation genetics utilizes the tools and concepts of genetics and
   applies them to problems in conservation biology. For example, molecular
   genetic techniques, such as protein electrophoresis, and analysis of
   mitochondrial DNA and highly variable nuclear genes (including DNA
   fingerprinting), have been important in documenting the extent and
   pattern of genetic variation in endangered species. We review these
   techniques and their advantages and disadvantages, and give examples of
   their application to endangered species.
   For captive animal populations, pedigree analysis has become the basic
   approach to evaluate breeding priority of particular individuals.
   Several pedigree analysis techniques are commonly used, but peeling and
   gene dropping give the most information. We compare these techniques and
   illustrate their value with applications to the Guam Rail, Przewalski's
   horse, and other endangered captive animals.
   The rationale for much conservation genetic interpretation is based in
   evolutionary genetics. We discuss the avoidance of inbreeding depression
   and the maintenance of genetic variation-both primary conservation
   genetic goals-from this perspective. In addition, we suggest aspects of
   these factors that deserve greater attention in their overall
   application to conservation planning.
   Finally, we briefly mention three evolutionary topics-the relationship
   of heterozygosity and fitness, population bottlenecks, and outbreeding
   depression-that have implications for conservation genetics. Although
   simple interpretation in these areas is appealing, we feel that because
   they are only generally understood and often quite controversial, their
   application to endangered-species management should be carefully
   evaluated and monitored.}},

   INVERTEBRATE ABUNDANCE IN A HONG-KONG STREAM}},

Abstract = {{1.  Small cages (294 cm2) containing unglazed clay quarry tiles we're
   used to investigate the influence of periphytic algae on
   macroinvertebrate abundance in a Hong Kong stream. Algal biomass was
   manipulated by shading cages with plastic sheets. Individual cages were
   assigned to one of three treatment groups: unshaded, shaded and deeply
   shaded. Invertebrate densities and algal biomass within cages were
   monitored after 23, 37 and 65 days.
   2. Multiple-regression analysis revealed that algal biomass,
   invertebrate morphospecies richness and total abundance declined with
   greater shading intensity. The responses of individual invertebrate taxa
   varied: some (especially Trichoptera) were unaffected by shading,
   whereas grazers (Baetidae, Psephenidae and Elmidae) declined as shading
   increased.
   3. Significant regressions of the densities of individual taxa upon
   algal and detrital standing stocks in cages had positive slopes, but
   algal biomass increased during the study while detrital standing stocks
   declined. Abundance of invertebrates declined or remained rather stable
   over time. Density increases resulting from a positive association with
   algae were apparently offset by declines in abundance correlated with
   reductions in detritus.
   4. Declines in algal biomass were associated with greater shading to
   which animals may respond directly. To uncouple the link between
   scarcity of algae and reduction of light intensity, the plastic covers
   on two groups of cages (deeply shaded and unshaded) which had been
   placed in the stream for 28 days were reversed so that cages which had
   been shaded became unshaded and vice versa. The cages were recovered on
   day 33. Only Coleoptera demonstrated a positive association with algae
   inside cages; no relationship between population densities and algal
   biomass or light intensity was apparent for other taxa. However, the
   design may have been confounded by deposition of sediment in the cages
   (due to declining stream discharge) which reduced population densities
   of colonizers.
   5. This study documents changes in invertebrate abundance and
   morphospecies richness in response periphyton and detritus standing
   stocks within patches. Summation of such responses may account for
   observed variations in benthic communities among Hong Kong streams which
   differ in the extent of shading by riparian vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Grasshopper densities were estimated in natural and agricultural
   grasslands on sandy soils. As compared to other arthropod groups
   grasshoppers react strongly to increasing fertilization level, first by
   decreasing species number next by decreasing density. This makes the
   combination of grasshopper species number and density to a sensitive
   tool for the monitoring of nitrogen load in grasslands. Effects of
   management type were insignificant. High percentages of grasshopper
   variation explained by maximum temperature, vegetation biomass, light
   extinction and intensity of the management suggest that these factors
   affect grasshoppers more than the fertilizer load does. This is
   supported by several field observations from literature. It is
   hypothesized that the distributions of grasshopper species with
   relatively slow development rates are shrinking by the effects of
   enhanced eutrophication on grasshopper environment, viz. increasing
   height and structural density of the vegetation, and consequently
   decreasing maximum temperature near the soil surface; slowly developing
   species may not be able to complete their annual cycle in such a cool
   environment. The positions of species on gradients are interpreted and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Migdolus fryanus is a sugarcane pest restricted to South America that is
   becoming more important due to the inefficacy of control methods against
   it.  The larvae bore into the plant root system and the available
   insecticides can not give adequate protection.  So, the search for
   alternate control strategies is mandatory.  However, the literature on
   bioethological studies of the species is scarce.  This work investigates
   the attraction of adult males in the field by females that is mediated
   by a sex pheromone that remains to be identified.  Dissected female
   thoraces were more attractive than other body parts.  A trap design for
   monitoring field populations of this species also is presented.}},

Abstract = {{We compared age-class distribution and sex ratios of captured and
   hunter-killed samples of black bears (Ursus americanus) to examine the
   relative agreement between methods used to monitor regional populations
   of this species. Mean ages of captured bears were greater than
   hunter-killed bears, and females were less abundant in the captured
   sample. Temporal differences between sampling methods (live capture =
   diurnal + nocturnal versus hunters = diurnal) may explain age-class
   differences. Variation in mobility (live capture = mainly stationary
   versus hunters = stationary + mobile) may explain sex ratio differences.
   Although we could not determine which sample was more representative of
   the population, our results suggest that biologists apply several
   indices as a more reliable approach to monitor the response of a
   population of bears to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Eight months after the 1988 bloom of Chrysochromulina polylepis Manton
   et Parke in Skagerrak and Kattegat, off the coasts of Norway, Sweden,
   and Denmark, an alternate cell type carrying a scale complement
   different from that of authentic C. polylepis appeared in some clones
   isolated from the bloom.  The cultures were recloned, and the
   development of the new clones was monitored.  In clones with 100\% cells
   of the alternate type, authentic cells reappeared, suggesting that the
   alternate cell type is a stage in the life cycle of C. polylepis and
   that transition between cell types occurs in both directions.  Growth
   rates of clone cultures (termed alpha-cultures) producing exclusively
   authentic cells, and of clone cultures (termed beta-cultures), capable
   of producing the alternate cell type, were compared at various
   combinations of temperature and photon fluence rate.  The beta-cultures
   were less tolerant of high temperatures and photon fluence rates
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 20-degrees-C, 570-mu-mol photons.m-2.s-1) than
   were the alpha-cultures.  At lower temperatures and photon fluence rates
   (less-than-or-equal-to 16-degrees-C, less-than-or-equal-to 90-mu-mol
   photons.m-2.s-1), beta-cultures grew better than alpha-cultures. 
   Relative abundance of the two cell types in beta-cultures changed in an
   apparently random manner during these experiments.  Preliminary results
   from flow cytometric analyses indicated that cells of the alternate type
   were about twice the size and contained an equal or smaller amount of
   DNA per cell compared to the authentic cells.  The beta-cultures were
   less toxic to Artemia nauplii than were the alpha-cultures.  Three other
   Chrysochromulina species tested were apparently nontoxic.}},

Abstract = {{Radiotelemetry was used from June 1986 through February 1987 to observe
   the movements of four Nile crocodiles, Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti,
   introduced into a resident population at Lake Ngezi, Zimbabwe.  The use
   of surgically-implanted transmitters was the first application of this
   technique on wild Nile crocodiles.  A subadult female (194 cm TL, 35 kg)
   and two males (256 cm, 81 kg; 348 cm, 260 kg) wandered throughout the
   area.  A large female (297 cm, 149 kg) moved > 12 km from her point of
   release to Ngezi River and nested; she guarded the nest site through 21
   January 1987 when she moved the hatchlings to a nearby creche.  A
   juvenile crocodile (120 cm TL, 8 kg) captured in Lake Ngezi was also
   monitored from June 1986 to February 1987.  It traversed some 15 km of
   the shoreline of Lake Ngezi and moved as much as 1.0 km overnight. 
   Evidence is presented that the translocated crocodiles, excluding the
   nesting female, exhibited exploratory behaviour throughout the
   nine-month observation period, and did not establish home ranges per se.}},

Abstract = {{Population of Sidalcea malvaeflora step, elegans, a plant on the Oregon
   Natural Heritage Data Base's 1987 Review List, were investigated to
   determine factors that limit its seed production.
   Viable, undeveloped and weevil damaged seeds from 100 racemes were
   monitored throughout the reproductive cycles of 1987 and 188.
   Experiments were conducted to examine potential limitation to seed
   production: hand cross-pollinations tested pollen limitation and
   water/nutrient treatments tested resource limitation.
   Production of viable was low (3.3\% of total ovules in 1987 and 7.1\% in
   1988), although 16.9 percent and 15.1 percent of ovules (in 1987 and
   1988 respectively) had dispersed before collection and could have
   contributed to viable seed set. The high incidence of undeveloped
   (aborted or unfertilized) ovules (41.1\% in 1987 and 51.5\% in 1988)
   suggested seed set was limited. Seed production was reduced by weevil
   predation (by 38.7\% of all ovules in 1987 and 26.5\% in 1988). Viable
   seed production in hand pollinated fruit was higher than in insect
   pollinated fruit. Racemes receiving extra water produced more viable
   seeds than controls.  Resource availability and insufficient pollination
   appear to affect seed production in S. malvaeflora ssp. elegans.}},

Abstract = {{The respiration rates of two silt loam soils, both under grazed pasture
   but of widely different fertility status were compared both in the field
   over 21 months and in a 56 day laboratory experiment.  The temporal
   variation in soil respiration {[}basal and glucose amended (1 h and
   overnight) rates] was measured on samples from the field.  Although the
   basal respiration rates measured in the low fertility soil were as high,
   and often exceeded the rate measured at the high fertility sites, the
   glucose-amended respiration rates (1 h and overnight) revealed further
   differences between the two soils.  This may be explained in terms of
   qualitative and quantitative differences in the microbial populations,
   using the authochthonous - zymogenous concept of microbial ecology.  The
   low fertility soil is rich in filamentous organisms and may support a
   predominantly autochthonous flora.  The high fertility soil, in
   contrast, seems to support a flora with a substantial zymogenous
   component.
   A laboratory experiment simulated soil dry during summer months and
   changes in soil respiration rates were monitored in soils during slow
   drying conditions from three initially different water contents.  Linear
   relationships were found for both soils between soil respiration and
   gravimetric water content.  Log-linear relationships were found between
   water potential and soil respiration rate.  The laboratory experiment
   also quantified the rate of substrate depletion during the experiment,
   at a particular water content (-0.05 MPa).  The results demonstrated a
   clear difference between the two soils.  Soil microorganisms from the
   low fertility site appeared not to run out of nutrients, despite there
   being no fresh inputs apart from mineralisation within the closed
   system, whereas the respiration rate of the fertile soil did decline.
   The significance of the laboratory and field observations on these two
   soils is discussed in terms of nutrient cycling in soils from under
   pasture and the organisms involved in these processes.}},

   (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) in a boreal forest to monitor the effects of
   simulated herbivory on the capability of these plants to recover.
   Above-ground growth of the damaged ramets was monitored for two or three
   growing seasons depending on the treatment. The differences in
   compensation ability between the species varied depending on the level
   investigated (ramets vs. branches). At the ramet level the lingonberry
   survived slightly better and grew more than bilberry. The reasons for
   this unexpected result are discussed. The growth of bilberry branches
   was more abundant, however. The effets on fecundity and on growth
   depended on the extent of damage. Fertile ramets survived and
   compensated better than did the sterile ones after slight damage, but
   their survival and growth was poor after severe damage. Defoliation had
   more damaging effects on the ramets than current-year branch clipping,
   in which more biomass was removed Defoliation did not break the apical
   dominance, and the ramets could not develop new branches from the
   dormant buds.}},

Abstract = {{The pest status of quince orchards is not thoroughly known; therefore
   pest control is based on the somewhat similar problems of other pome
   fruits and peach. In order to learn more on quince problems in Northern
   Italy, the flight of some Lepidoptera bas been monitored. Pheromone
   traps for Cydia pomonella (L.), Cydia molesta (Busck), Pandemis cerasana
   (Hb.), Archips podana (Sc.),Archips rosana (L.), Cossus cossus (L.),
   Anarsia lineatella Zeller were placed in two quince orchards.
   C. molesta and C.pomonella have been shown to be major pests.  The
   number of flights and higher population density of C molesta make it
   more dangerous. It was not possible to outline the flight pattern of
   Zeuzera pyrina (L.), causing serious damages to branches, as the
   synthetic female pheromone has only recently become available.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive parameters and sexual behavior of free-ranging Hanuman
   langurs (Presbytis entellus) were studied over a 13-year period at
   Jodhpur, India in a population that breeds throughout the year.
   Long-term monitoring of individually identified females living in
   one-male-multi-female troops revealed a mean cycle length of 24.1 days
   (n = 113), a mean gestation of 200.3 days (n = 31), menarche at 29.0
   months (n = 10), first conception at 35.0 months (n = 12), and a mean
   birth interval of 16.7 months (n = 114). The loss of unweaned infants
   accelerated the resumption of menstruation, receptivity, and
   attractivity; shortened the period between estrus and next conception;
   and reduced the median birth interval by 20.5\%, thus supporting the
   sexual selection hypothesis of male infanticide. The decline of
   fertility with age (as measured by the rates of conception per estrus
   period), a regular postreproductive survival for up to 9 years (which
   can account for about 25\% of a female's life span) and indications for
   the existence of a ``true menopause{''} support the view that a
   postreproductive period in langurs is the result of natural selection.
   There is very limited evidence for situation-dependent receptivity,
   because only 7.5\% of all estrous days (n = 1,037) fell outside of the
   mid-cycle period with at the same time strongly reduced proceptivity and
   attractivity. Moreover, postconception estrus behavior showed a
   stereotypical pattern during 31 pregnancies and did not reflect a
   situation-dependent response to the immigration of new and potentially
   infanticidal males. It is likely that females competed for sperm of the
   harem holder, because the probability of conception increased
   significantly with an increase in the number of copulations, and when
   the number of females copulating on the same day decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Six coral reef locations between Miami and Key West were marked with
   stainless steel stakes and rephotographed periodically between 1984 and
   1991. The monitored areas included two photostations in the Looe Key
   National Marine Sanctuary, two photostations in the Key Largo National
   Marine Sanctuary, and two photostations in the Biscayne National Park.
   Stations were monitored for species number, percent cover, and species
   diversity of the scleractinian and hydrozoan stony corals. Monitoring
   began in 1984 for photostations in the National Marine Sanctuaries and
   in 1989 for stations in the National Park.
   All six areas lost coral species between the initial survey year and
   1991. Survey areas lost between one and four species; these losses
   constituted between 13\% and 29\% of their species richness. Five of the
   six areas lost live coral cover. Based upon photographs taken repeatedly
   at these locations, net losses ranged between 7.3\% and 43.9\%. In the
   one station showing an increase in coral cover, the increase was only
   for the canopy branches of Acropora palmata; understory branches of this
   same species lost surface area at the same rate as canopy branches
   gained area. For most of the common species, there was a reduction in
   the total number of living colonies in the community, and a diminution
   in the number of large, mature colonies. Throughout the study period,
   there was no recruitment to any of the photostations by any of the
   massive frame building coral species.
   Mortality of this magnitude is often associated with hurricane damage,
   but in this survey the losses occurred during a period without
   catastrophic storms. Sources of mortality identifiable in the
   photographs include (1) black band disease and (2) `'bleaching''; other
   potential sources of mortality are also considered. We conclude, for our
   survey areas, that loss rates of this magnitude cannot be sustained for
   protracted periods if the coral community is to persist in a
   configuration resembling historical coral reef community structure in
   the Florida Keys.}},

Abstract = {{Major physical disturbances impacted fringing reefs at 4 to 12 m depth
   off the south coast of St. John, at intervals of 28, 14 and 12 months
   over a 6 year period (1985-1991). The most wave exposed habitats were
   dominated by the hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis and the encrusting
   gorgonian Erythropodium caribaeorum. Both of these species displayed
   high resistance stability in response to the 1987 bleaching event and to
   Hurricanes Gilbert (1988) and Hugo (1989). Although Hurricane Hugo was
   ranked as the most severe hurricane of the past century, it caused
   comparatively little damage to the shallow exposed reef, illustrating
   that the effects of physical disturbance may not a ways conform to a
   priori predictions based on wave exposure. This counter-intuitive result
   is explicable when the chronology of disturbance is considered. For
   example, the shallow exposed community was more heavily damaged than the
   protected reef by Hurricane Gilbert occurring one year prior to
   Hurricane Hugo. Sponges and thick mats of E. caribaeorum had accumulated
   on the protected reef during a 54 month period of little disturbance and
   were vulnerable to disturbance by virtue of their elevation above the
   substratum. These organisms were dislodged by extreme water motion
   generated by Hurricane Hugo. In contrast, the shallow exposed community
   was still recovering from Hurricane Gilbert when Hurricane Hugo struck.
   Monitored populations of two coral species, Agaricia agaricites and
   Tubastrea coccinea, declined over the six year period, but recruitment
   in 1990 partially compensated for high mortality caused by Hurricane
   Hugo. There were significant increases in the abundance of algal turf on
   three out of the four study reefs (4 m exposed and protected, 12 m
   protected) in response to the creation of patch space by the multiple
   physical disturbances. This study demonstrates the need to interpret
   recent disturbances in light of the history of past disturbance on the
   reef.}},

Abstract = {{The recruitment of juvenile corals and post-settlement mortality are
   important processes for coral population dynamics and reef community
   ecology. I monitored juvenile coral recruitment and survival on a
   severely disturbed reef in Bermuda from 1981 to 1989 and on adjacent
   healthy reefs from 1986 to 1990. Porites astreoides was the dominant
   recruiting species at all sites, due to the release of brooded planulae
   that may settle rapidly. The dominant corals on Bermuda's reef, Diploria
   spp., were poor recruiters, perhaps due to the broadcast mode of
   reproduction of these species. However, Diploria spp. have lower
   juvenile mortality rates compared to P. astreoides, which may explain
   their abundance on Bermuda's reefs.
   Brooding corals, primarily agariciids, were the dominant recruits on
   Atlantic reefs compared to high recruitment rates by spawning acroporids
   in the Pacific, which may be the result of different environmental
   conditions and/or evolutionary trends in the two oceans. The latter
   group also suffered high post-settlement mortality compared to brooding
   corals in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Massive corals in both
   oceans had generally low recruitment rates, related to their spawning
   mode of reproduction, and low rates of post-settlement mortality. The
   dominant role of long-lived massive corals on the Atlantic and Pacific
   reefs can be understood in terms of their life-history strategy in
   comparison to the relatively short-lived Pacific acroporids and Atlantic
   agariciids that rely on different strategies to maintain their
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of home environment characteristics were evaluated in a
   multistage, stratified, cluster sample (N = 3 866) of the general
   population who lived in the district of Pisa (middle Italy).  Each
   subject completed a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire
   that contained questions about respiratory symptoms/diseases and risk
   factors (e.g., type of heating, fuels used for cooking and heating). 
   Cough and asthma were significantly more frequent in men who did not
   smoke and who did not use natural gas for cooking and heating.  Attacks
   of shortness of breath accompanied by wheeze, wheeze, dyspnea, and
   cardiovascular conditions in female nonsmokers were associated with use
   of a stove or forced-air circulation for heating; the type of fuel used
   did not affect this result.  Multiple logistic models, which accounted
   for independent effects of age, smoking status, pack-years, childhood
   respiratory illness, education, zone of residence, and work exposure to
   dusts, chemicals, or fumes, showed significantly increased odds ratios
   for (a) cough and phlegm in males (associated with bottled gas for
   cooking), (b) wheeze and shortness of breath with wheeze in females
   (associated with the use of a stove or forced-air circulation).  These
   results, which confirm our previous observations in an unpolluted rural
   area of north Italy, indicate that characteristics of the home
   environment, as assessed by questionnaire, may be linked to mild adverse
   health effects, i.e., respiratory symptoms, in the general population. 
   The results also identify the need to better characterize the
   dose-response relationship in indoor air pollution monitoring studies
   that include subsamples of this population.}},

Abstract = {{We constructed age-structured models of the population dynamics of the
   highly endangered Mediterranean monk seal Monachus monachus which took
   account of demographic stochasticity and environmental stochasticity
   caused by episodic catastrophic events. These models were used to
   identify demographic characteristics which we knew could be measured in
   monk seal populations and whose occurrence could be used to predict when
   small seal populations were most at risk of extinction.
   High-risk predictors had high predictive power (there was a 75-85\%
   probability that a population went extinct within 60 years), but they
   were not observed at all in 5-15\% of computer simulations, and when
   they did occur there was little time to act (25-35\% of populations went
   extinct within 10 years). Populations which show such indicators have a
   poor probability of persistence, even if immediate management action is
   taken. Lower risk predictors were observed in 95-100\% of all computer
   simulations and provided at least 10 years' warning in 75-95\% of cases.
   However, their predictive power was relatively low (55-70\% of
   simulations went extinct within 60 years). If juvenile or adult survival
   was increased immediately after a low-risk predictor was observed (for
   example, by establishing rescue centres for abandoned pups and animals
   entangled in fishing gear) the probability of extinction could be
   reduced to one-tenth of its value without intervention.}},

Abstract = {{We estimated the minimum size of the roan antelope Hippotragus equinus
   population in the Parc National de l'Akagera in Rwanda to be at least
   144 animals, based on a two and a half year study of individually
   recognized stable social groups. Data from the same study were used to
   estimate the annual birth rate, and the survival rate of male calves,
   female calves, adult females and juvenile females; and to identify
   factors which would result in year-to-year variations in survival. The
   results of this analysis were incorporated into an age-structured model
   of the population's dynamics which took account of demographic and
   environmental stochasticity. This model was then used to determine the
   viability of the roan population in the park and to identify demographic
   characteristics whose occurrence could be used to predict when the
   population was most at risk of extinction.
   The risk of extinction could be predicted if the number of stable groups
   within the park was monitored in September of each year. This risk could
   be greatly reduced if a reciprocal arrangement was established with
   other protected areas such that the population in the park could be
   reinforced with new stable groups when the number of stable groups fell
   below three. However, the risks-particularly of disease
   transfer-associated with such reinforcement programmes should be clearly
   recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Recent fieldwork and a literature review suggest that Lesotho has 285

   1940 probably no longer occur. Population changes this century are
   suspected for 68 species - 36 have declined and 32 have increased. One
   hundred and eighty-two species have populations below 1000 birds or are
   of international importance. Of these, 82 species probably breed in
   Lesotho and 12 more are visitors of conservation importance in southern
   Africa. It is suggested that these 94 species should be the basis for
   the country's bird conservation policies. Changes to wildlife
   legislation, improved conservation education and encouragement of
   amateur birdwatchers are suggested as initial conservation measures.
   Beyond this, much research and monitoring will be needed to save
   Lesotho's wildlife.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding biology of a free living population of fat dormouse (Glis
   glis) was studied for three years (1982-1984) in a deciduous forest on
   Colli Berici (Vicenza, Italy), where 57 nest boxes were set, to assess
   whether communal nesting and communal nursing occurred.  Nest box
   occupation was monitored and animals were individually tagged. 
   Copulation occurred mostly in the first part of July; births in the
   first part of August.  By counting the number of suckling young, the
   average litter size was found to be 4.7 (range = 2-7).  Only one litter
   per season was produced.  Females matured after their first hibernation,
   or, at latest, after the second one.  The growth rate of young from
   small litters was significantly greater than that of young from large
   litters.  Of the nests found in the nest boxes, 27.5\% were communal
   nests with two (in one case three) breeding females and their litters. 
   Therefore, about 44\% of the females nested in communal nests.  Whenever
   a difference in age allowed litters to be told apart, females in
   communal nests were observed to nurse each other's pups.  Communal
   nesting was not correlated with the availability of nest boxes or
   natural holes, and the number of communal nests was significantly higher
   than expected by chance.  The only case of proved relatedness between
   conesting females, was one of mother and daughter.}},

Abstract = {{The caddisfly, Nectopsyche albida, was exposed to 0.6 mg mercury
   nitrate/L for 72 h and individual times to death recorded. All
   individuals were analyzed electrophoretically at six polymorphic loci.
   Time to death differed significantly among genotypes at the
   phosphoglucomutase and two alcohol dehydrogenase loci and among levels
   of heterozygosity. There is substantial evidence suggesting that many
   taxa possess allozyme genotypes exhibiting differential sensitivity to
   anthropogenic contaminants and natural stressors. Elimination of
   sensitive genotypes may reduce the ability of impacted populations to
   recover from additional impacts and may lessen the likelihood that they
   will adapt to slowly changing environmental conditions. Accordingly, we
   emphasize that (1) genetic standardization of bioassay organisms is
   necessary to assure consistency of results among testing facilities, (2)
   genetic monitoring may be a more sensitive method than numerical
   censusing to detect low levels of anthropogenic pollution, and (3) loss
   of genetic variation may hinder population persistence.}},

Abstract = {{While a number of papers document that sensitivity to pollution is
   correlated with single-locus genotype, only one has addressed
   associations with multilocus complexes. We exposed larval caddisflies,
   Nectopsyche albida to inorganic mercury and recorded individual times to
   death, genetically characterized each individual at six polymorphic loci
   by starch gel electrophoresis, and tested the effects of multilocus
   genotype on time to death. Two two-locus complexes and two three-locus
   complexes were significantly correlated with survival time. This
   supports earlier studies that monitoring multilocus and single-locus
   genotype frequencies may be useful in detecting and measuring
   environmental impacts; however, we disagree that variation in survival
   time among genotypes per se supports selectionist theory, because no
   heritability of resistance has been demonstrated. We also disagree that
   enzyme systems not exhibiting such variation are nonadaptive and discuss
   how the elimination of sensitive multilocus genotypes may hinder
   population persistence.}},

Abstract = {{During the four years 1986-1989 we monitored an adult male population of
   the almond seed wasp, Eurytoma amygdali Enderlein, in the region of
   Thessaloniki, using sex pheromone traps, each containing 25 living
   virgin females.  The emergence of adults from infested almonds of the
   previous year was also monitored in cages in the field, as well as the
   progress of fruit infestation and egg hatching in the almonds of the
   Retsou variety.  Finally, two chemical control experiments were done
   against the newly hatched larvae to determine the optimal time for
   chemical control.
   During the 4-year study the start of adult captures occurred between
   April 13 and April 24, and the maximum between April 17 and May 11.  In
   most cases, adult emergence from infested almonds in field cages began
   with a delay of 2 to 14 days in relation to the start of trap captures,
   and was affected by factors such as the date of cage installation.  In
   all years most eggs hatched within 12-18 days of ovi-position.
   A treatment with phosphamidon at a concentration of 0.06\%, applied to
   tree branches of the Retsou variety with a hand-sprayer on May 23, 1987,
   when 54.1\% of the eggs had hatched, was very effective (final
   infestation in July was 4.7\% as compared to 89.1\% of the untreated
   control).  Three treatments with phosphamidon 0.06\%, applied each on
   different tree branches, on May 14, 20, and 25, 1988, when the
   percentage of egg hatching was 7.8\%, 65.3\%, and 93.5\%, respectively,
   were all very effective (final infestation in July was 1.6\%, 3.6\%, and
   4.2\% respectively, as compared to 93.6\% of the untreated control). 
   However, the presence of mines in the perisperm and outer endosperm,
   caused by the feeding larvae before they were killed, was more
   conspicuous in the almonds treated when the percentage of egg hatching
   was high.
   Our data suggest that the almond seed wasp can be effectively controlled
   with a single treatment of a systemic insecticide against the newly
   hatched larvae, preferably applied when the percentage of egg hatching
   is low to medium (between 10\% and 50\%).  In the area of Thessaloniki,
   during 1986-89, 10\% and 50\% of egg hatching occurred about 21 and 27
   days respectively after the beginning of male adult captures in
   pheromone traps.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews investigations on the ecophysiology of a population
   of roach, Rutilus rutilus, from a subalpine oligotrophic lake in the
   Austrian Tirol. Metabolic responses to season and temperature were
   studied in whole animals, tissues and selected enzymes. The exponent of
   the relationship between body mass and three levels of the metabolic
   rate of acclimated fish was 0.82 +/- 0.02, 0.60 +/- 0.15, and 0.75 +/-
   0.01 at 4, 12, and 20-degrees-C respectively. Various combinations of
   long-term acclimation to constant or seasonally fluctuating temperatures
   and long-term (up to 14 days) monitoring of VO2 at the acclimation
   temperature led to the conclusion that the aerobic power of fish
   swimming in the routine mode does not show any sign of being temperature
   compensated. On the other hand, there are several indications that the
   energy expenditure of spontaneously swimming fish is adjusted to the
   seasonal pattern of environmental change and that these responses of
   metabolism and behaviour are controlled by both endogenous and exogenous
   factors. The rate of oxygen consumption of gill and muscle tissue `brei'
   from fish caught during a seasonal cycle and measured at 15-degrees-C
   appears to follow closely the reproductive and gonadal cycle of the
   living fish. The same holds for the activities of phosphofructokinase,
   acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, and cytochrome oxidase. On the other hand, the
   Na+, K+-ATPase of the kidney shows near perfect temperature compensation
   when fish acclimated to 5 and 25-degrees-C are compared, whereas an
   equally pronounced case of inverse temperature acclimation has been
   reported for the activity of digestive enzymes in the gut. Summarizing
   these data it is pointed out that the temperature relationship of a
   poikilothermic organism is the sum of often very diverse temperature
   relationships of specific metabolic and behavioural functions. In the
   case of the roach, strong effects of acclimation temperature on the
   molecular level, sometimes in the opposite direction, combine with
   seasonal effects on enzyme activities and tissue respiration. However,
   on the whole animal level the fish behave as strictly non-compensating
   poikilotherms, the reproductive cycle being the only detectable
   influence capable of modulating the basic temperature relationship of
   energy expenditure.}},

Abstract = {{This project has been successful in meeting its objectives in terms of
   demonstrating that catchment liming techniques can restore acidified
   waters to conditions suitable for fish populations for relatively long
   periods. This improvement in conditions has extended to the inlet
   stream, which provides vital fish spawning and nursery areas, which are
   difficult to treat effectively be other means in remote locations. The
   project has also provided an assessment of the effectiveness of
   differing rates and modes of lime application. which suggest that only
   quite restricted parts of a catchment require treatment. This not only
   maximizes the cost-effectiveness of the treatments, but also helps to
   minimize any side-effects on, for example. moorland vegetation. The
   biological monitoring programme at Loch Fleet has also provided an
   assessment of the overall ecological consequences of adding limestone to
   naturally acidic and calcium-deficient ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{From 1988 to 1989, the effects of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides
   Lacepede) stocking rate on bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque) and
   bass populations were studied in twelve 0.1-ha mesocosms in Alabama.
   About 240 mature bluegill were stocked in each pond in May, and their
   reproduction was monitored biweekly from June through September. Bass
   fingerlings were stocked at rates of 15, 28, and 55 fish per pond (four
   replicates) in June, and all fish were harvested in February. Mean
   length, weight, and relative condition of bass and number of young
   bluegill decreased with increasing stocking rate. Mean weight, growth,
   and relative condition of adult bluegill were directly related to
   stocking rate. A bimodal spawning pattern of bluegill was observed in
   all treatments, but the second peak was three-fold greater in the high
   bass rate than in the low. A combination of bass and bluegill in
   mesocosms offers several advantages over bluegill alone. The medium bass
   stocking rate is recommended to maintain both fishes in good condition.
   Alternatively, bass may be crowded to keep bluegill in peak reproductive
   condition and optimal growth, prevent overcrowding of young bluegill,
   and reduce predation pressure on invertebrate populations.}},

Abstract = {{Population-, community-, and ecosystem-level responses to pulsed dosing
   of a pyrethroid insecticide were studied in experimental aquatic
   mesocosms. Twelve mesocosms (0.1 ha, 700 m3 volume) were dosed with
   technical-grade esfenvalerate dissolved in acetone (subsurface injection
   of 0-, 0.25-, 0.67-, or 1.71-mu-g/L nominal concentrations in
   triplicated mesocosms) on six dates at two-week intervals. We monitored
   dissipation rate of esfenvalerate; survival, growth, and reproduction of
   bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus); dynamics of benthos and zooplankton;
   biomass and productivity of phytoplankton; macrophyte biomass; diurnal
   oxygen pulse; and water quality over a five-month interval.
   Esfenvalerate dissipated rapidly from the water column (half-life, 10
   h). Zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates decreased at 0.25-mu-g/L.
   Changes in invertebrate fauna due to esfenvalerate were partly obscured
   by indirect effects and seasonal dynamics. Bluegill survival, biomass,
   adult male survival, and reproductive success were negatively correlated
   with measured esfenvalerate concentrations. Although direct mortality of
   fish and invertebrates may be predictable from laboratory single-species
   tests, indirect responses of fish, zooplankton, and phytoplankton are
   predictable only with prior knowledge of factors controlling ecosystem
   structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{A recirculating aquatic microecosystem consisting of three subsystems
   and with a total volume of 7.5 L was used to study effects of the
   insecticide chlorpyrifos. The three subsystems represent the trophic
   levels of primary producers (algae), herbivores (Daphnia magna), and
   decomposers (bacteria on a sand filter). Two of four microecosystems
   were perturbed with chlorpyrifos 429 d after they were started. All
   subsystems were monitored weekly for several chemical and biological
   variables. The response of the systems was followed for 130 d after
   chlorpyrifos application. An immediate decrease of the Daphnia
   population could be explained from the mortality observed in single
   species tests. The population recovered within two weeks. Two weeks
   after the introduction of chlorpyrifos, the pH in all subsystems dropped
   by about two units. Concurrent with the pH changes, there were changes
   in the algal biomass, the Daphnia numbers, and the oxygen
   concentrations. The pH in the treated systems was comparable to the
   controls about 90 d after the treatment, but the other variables did not
   recover. These effects were not predicted by any single-species test
   and, therefore, represented ecosystem effects.}},

Abstract = {{Flufenamic acid (FA) is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
   drug. It is also known to be an uncoupling agent of oxidative
   phosphorylation in mitochondria. The interaction of FA and ethanol has
   been of concern in the occupational health field, since alcohol
   consumption is a common habit among members of the working population.
   Thus, we investigated the effects of FA on ethanol metabolism in the
   rat. In the first experiment, FA and ethanol were administered
   intragastrically to male Wistar rats. Ethanol and acetaldehyde were
   measured in blood samples collected from the tail vein by head-space gas
   chromatography. In the second experiment, the interaction of FA and
   ethanol was observed in the perfused rat liver. The following items were
   monitored in perfused livers from both fed and fastd rats: uptake rate
   of ethanol, production rate of acetaldehyde, level of reduced pyridine
   nucleotides, and oxygen consumption rate. In the first experiment, the
   rats with FA showed significantly higher concentrations of both ethanol
   and acetaldehyde in blood after ethanol intake than the rats without FA.
   In the perfused liver, FA suppressed ethanol uptake, and increased
   acetaldehyde concentration in the effluent. FA decreased the level of
   intracellular reduced pyridine nucleotides which had been elevated by
   ethanol. FA caused an increase in the oxygen consumption rate, which was
   not altered by the coexistence of ethanol. It was concluded that FA
   suppressed ethanol metabolism due to suppression of acetaldehyde
   oxidation in the liver, despite its uncoupling effect on oxidative
   phosphorylation in mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of colony growth and development,
   food storage, foraging activity and weather on the migration behavior of
   African honey bees in the Okavango River Delta, Botswana. Four
   observation colonies were studied during the honey bee migration season
   (November-May), at which time the availability of blooming species was
   reduced. Two of the colonies (colonies 1 \& 2) migrated during the study
   period, while the remaining two (colonies 3 \& 4) did not. During the
   4-6 weeks preceding the onset of migration preparations. colonies 1 \& 2
   exhibited increasing population sizes, high levels of brood production
   with low brood mortality, relatively large stores of food, and
   increasing mass. In contrast, the populations of colonies 3 \& 4 did not
   increase. brood-rearing activity was erratic and lower, brood mortality
   was higher, food stores became depleted and colony mass declined. Both
   colonies 3 \& 4 ceased rearing brood, and colony 3 died of starvation.
   Colony foraging activity was examined by monitoring waggle-dance
   activity 2-3 days each week. For 4-6 weeks before the onset of migration
   in colonies 1 \& 2, daily foraging areas and mean daily foraging
   distances became increasingly large and variable. Colonies 3 \& 4
   exhibited foraging patterns similar to those observed for colonies 1 \&
   2 preceding migration. There was no clear association between 7 weather
   parameters examined and migration behavior. These data suggest that
   migration is influenced by an interaction of intra-colony demographics,
   food reserves and foraging patterns. Migration may be feasible only for
   those colonies that possess (1) a population of appropriate size and age
   structure to compensate for the natural attrition of older workers
   during the emigration process, and (2) sufficient food reserves for
   long-distance travel and the establishment of a new nest. Changing
   foraging patterns may reflect a deteriorating foraging environment,
   which may trigger the onset of migration preparations, provided that
   colony demographics and food reserves are conducive. Colonies that show
   decreased brood production, higher brood mortality and reduced food
   stores may be incapable of migrating, even when experiencing
   deteriorating foraging conditions. Rather, such colonies may have a
   greater chance of survival if they attempt to persist in a given area.}},

Abstract = {{The use of fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   population in suspension and in young developing biofilms on a glass
   surface is described. The fluorescence emission at 460 nm for
   NADH/NAD(P)H when excited at 327 nm was used to monitor quantitative
   increase in cell numbers in suspension and during biofilm development
   over a 36-h period NADH/NAD(P)H fluorescence ratio, allowed for the
   discrimination of living cells from dead cells both in suspension and in
   biofilms. Living cells, yielded ratios of 0.38 +/- 0.4 and dead cells
   yielded ratios of 0.23 +/- 0.05. The overlap between the two population
   baseline studies was less than 5\% (p < 0.05). The fluorescence spectra
   of living P. aeruginosa and dead cells at identical concentrations when
   excited at 334 nm has a fluorescence maxima at 450 nm which is mainly
   due to NADH/NAD(P)H and partly due to riboflavin. Viability of living
   and dead cells was confirmed by plating 0.1 alquots from suspensions
   onto agar and incubation at 37-degrees-C for 24 h. The living suspension
   yielded 10(5) CFU and no growth from the suspension of dead cells.
   A comparison of the determination of P. aeruginosa cell concentration by
   optical density, quantitative cell counts and fluorescence intensity (at
   327 nm, 334 nm and 404 nm) are presented and show a linear relationship.
   These findings will allow the real time determination of the number of
   viable cells within a biofilm and in suspension and the determination of
   the ratio of living versus dead cells following exposure to antibiotic.
   This will lead to further understanding of the basic mechanisms of
   action of antibiotics on adherent biofilms.}},

Abstract = {{Adult Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) black light trap and pheromone trap
   catches were related to oviposition on com and tomatoes in an attempt to
   assess the utility of the pheromone trap for making pest management
   decisions on tomato in western North Carolina. Pheromone trap catches
   increased during early stages of H. zea flight periods, while increases
   in black light trap catches did not occur until later in the season when
   populations were at their highest levels as indicated by egg densities.
   Oviposition on tomato was low until surrounding com fields became
   unattractive (i.e., dried silk) to ovipositing females, but once
   oviposition was initiated on tomato it continued throughout the
   remainder of the season. Lycopersicon hirsutum Humb. PI 126445, a wild
   tomato species that is more attractive to ovipositing females than L.
   esculentum Miller cv. Walter, enabled us to detect the switch from corn
   to tomato more readily. Correlations between pheromone trap catches and
   oviposition on tomato were significant only in 1988; but in 1987 and
   1989, trap catches were significantly correlated with oviposition on
   tomato occurring 1 and 2 wk, respectively, prior to pheromone trap
   catches. Pheromone traps may be most useful for the early detection of
   H. zea oviposition on tomatoes by providing a means to time egg

Abstract = {{Populations of the trefoil seed chalcid, Bruchophagus platypterus
   (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae), were monitored in plots of
   birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) that were treated with
   malathion. Blossom and pod stage applications of insecticide did not
   provide adequate suppression of B. platypterus adults. Bud stage
   malathion applications were often associated with increased B.
   platyterus sweep counts. Aprostocetus (= Tetrastichus) bruchophagi
   (Gahan), a parasitoid of the seed chalcid, was also sometimes found in
   higher numbers in treated plots. The loss of plant bugs (Hemiptera:
   Miridae) in the treated trefoil resulted in earlier blossoming than in
   the untreated trefoil. The seed chalcids were presumably attracted to
   this more mature trefoil. In one trial, parasitism rates were decreased
   in the bud stage and the multiple spray treatments. We recommend that
   when an insecticide treatment is required in trefoil seed production,
   that it be applied during the early bud stage to minimize loss of

Abstract = {{1. Reciprocal-removal experiments were conducted to test for the
   occurrence and consequences of interspecific competition between the
   rodents Mus musculus and Peromyscus leucopus on a large Virginia barrier
   island (USA). Habitat use and population density of each species were
   monitored during pre- and post-removal periods.
   2. The species exhibited conspicuous differences in pre-removal habitat
   use, with Mus occupying grassland and Peromyscus occupying adjacent
   shrub thickets.
   3. Neither species exhibited a significant habitat shift or numerical
   increase following the removal of its putative competitor. Several
   possible explanations for the apparent absence of competitive release
   are discussed.
   4. Either competition did not occur during the experimental period, or
   it occurred but not on a level detectable with our experimental design.
   The absence of habitat shifts, which should be detectable even on the
   level of the individual, argue for the former.
   5. The fact that Mus and Peromyscus could have coexisted at this
   location for only 300 years or so argues against the reduction of
   competition by `competitive coevolution.' These results thus suggest
   that habitat selection and intraspecific interactions are much more
   important determinants of habitat use by these species than are
   interspecific interactions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Intensive population studies were conducted for 10 years on red
   grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) and the parasitic nematode,
   Trichostrongylus tenuis, in northern England. Winter loss was the key
   factor determining changes in grouse numbers, although breeding losses
   were also important.
   2. T. tenuis had an aggregated distribution within the adult grouse
   population, even though the degree of aggregation was relatively low
   compared with other parasite systems. Recruitment of parasites into the
   adult worm population was dependent on grouse density.
   3. Both winter loss and breeding losses were correlated with the
   intensity of parasite infection.
   4. Experimental reduction in parasite burdens consistently increased
   breeding production and winter survival of grouse thus demonstrating
   that parasites cause increased winter and breeding losses.
   5. The red grouse-T. tenuis system exhibits three conditions that will
   generate population cycles: (i) parasite-induced reduction in grouse
   breeding production, (ii) a low degree of parasite aggregation within
   the grouse population, and (iii) time delays in parasite recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{The development of Varroa jacobsoni infestations was monitored in two
   groups of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies kept in SE Finland under
   conditions where no infestation pressure from outside apiaries was
   possible and in a climate with a brood rearing period of less than five
   months. One group of 36 colonies was infested with 5-8 mites/colony and
   another group of 20 colonies with c. 100 mites/colony. Mite population
   levels in the colonies were followed by using debris samples. Yearly
   mite population growth factors were calculated based on values of
   maximum numbers of mites in the debris per day during the brood season.
   The averages varied from 8.2 to 24.6 despite the short brood rearing
   period and an average calculated 39.8\% loss of the mite population in
   winter. The results of chemical treatment of five colonies/group, 38
   months (group 1) and 26 months (group 2) after the infestation,
   supported the population growth results. Equal numbers of mites were
   killed by the second treatment in the following autumn, both in
   previously treated colonies and in untreated colonies, a result
   stressing the need to treat all colonies in an apiary simultaneously.
   Close correlations were found between mite downfall levels in autumn and
   the number of mites on wintering bees. It is concluded that under the
   conditions described, untreated colonies can survive for 4-5 years from
   an initial infestation by a few mites.}},

Abstract = {{1. Sample size estimates for monitoring phytophagous mite population
   densities in apple orchards were derived from dispersion statistics in a
   two-stage sampling system.
   2. Taylor's power law proved to be a more suitable model than the
   regression method of Iwao \& Kuno (1971).
   3. Using dummy variables in Taylor's power law it was found that in some
   cases spray applications affected the dispersion statistics and,
   therefore, sample size estimates.
   4. The background variances were unstable from farm to farm and season
   to season, contributing to unstable sample size estimates.
   5. As the unstable background variances were thought to be partly due to
   differences in the size of the orchards on the different farms, it was
   suggested that in future orchards be sub-divided into blocks not
   exceeding 2 ha for monitoring mite population densities.
   6. There was a trend suggesting that the sampling error decreased more
   rapidly when the number of trees sampled was increased than when the
   number of leaves per tree was increased.}},

Title = {{CUTTING HEIGHT AND THE BIOMASS AND TILLER DENSITY OF LOLIUM-PERENNE
   AMENITY TURFS}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{611-618}},
Abstract = {{1. Amenity turfs of five accessions of Lolium perenne L. were
   established and subsequently maintained at nine mowing heights ranging
   from 9 to 66 mm. The turfs' development over 1-5 years was monitored by
   measuring turf biomass and tiller density in order to determine (i)
   whether such measurements provide useful information about turf
   behaviour, and (ii) whether turfs conform to patterns observed in other
   types of vegetation.
   2. Measurements of turf height, biomass and tiller density were
   sensitive enough to quantify differences between management regimes and
   between genotypes. Biomass was directly related to turf height, whereas
   tiller density was inversely related to height. Accessions selected
   specifically for use in amenity turfs had higher biomasses and tiller
   densities at each mowing height than did pasture accessions.
   3. The practical implications of these findings are that a height
   selected to maximize the resistance of a turf to the damage caused by
   wear will necessarily be associated with a coarse textured appearance,
   but that there is sufficient genetic variation within L. perenne for
   this inverse association between turf function and appearance to be
   circumvented, within limits, by plant selection.
   4. The turfs had much in common with other crowded populations of
   plants. Biomass was inversely related to density, but the slope of
   equations fitted to the data did not conform strictly to the
   self-thinning rule. The slopes of biomass-density relationships may have
   been the same in all accessions, but the biomass-density relationship
   was not a species constant because of variation in the intercept. Turfs
   differed from other populations in that the shortest turfs had heavier
   tillers than expected from an interspecific trend line, and the biomass
   densities (biomass/ volume) of the shortest turfs were high by
   comparison with other vegetation types.
   5. It is concluded that the basic measurements and principles of
   population biology have an application in turf science.}},

Abstract = {{To test the effect of prey abundance on the orb spider Zygiella x-notata
   I conducted two field experiments at the same site. In the first
   experiment, from 20 June to 9 September 1978, I augmented prey abundance
   in two plots interspersed within four control plots; at the end of the
   experiment the mean number of spiders was 2.7 times higher in
   prey-augmented plots than in control plots, and the difference was
   highly significant (P = 0.005). In the second experiment, from 25 June
   to 16 September 1979, I augmented prey abundance in one plot located in
   between two control plots; at the end of the experiment the number of
   spiders was > 3.0 times higher in the prey-augmented plot than in each
   control plot. Although numbers of spiders in the 1979 experiment could
   not be analyzed statistically because the treatment was not replicated,
   they support the results of the 1978 experiment. I monitored the
   phenology of the population at the experimental site and an
   unmanipulated population at a different site throughout 1978 and 1979.
   In both years reproduction began earlier in the experimental population
   than in the unmanipulated population. In 1979 I collected eggs sacs in
   both populations. The experimental population contained more eggs and
   heavier eggs than those than in the unmanipulated population. Within the
   experimental population, egg sacs in the prey-augmented plot contained
   heavier eggs than those in control plots.}},

Abstract = {{1. Ocotea tenera (Lauraceae) is a dioecious understorey tree which
   occurs in the lower montane forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica. In a
   natural population of O. tenera trees whose ages were estimated to range
   from 14 to 30 years old, staminate trees slightly outnumbered pistillate
   trees but the sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1.
   Staminate and pistillate trees were non-randomly distributed with
   respect to each other. The probability that a tree's nearest neighbour
   was of the opposite sex was much higher than expected by chance.
   2. Males were also more common in two experimental plots, one
   established in 1981 and the other in 1984, although only one of the
   plots showed a significantly male-biased sex ratio. Spatial
   distributions of staminate and pistillate trees in both experimental
   plots were indistinguishable from random.
   3. Individual trees in both the natural population and experimental
   plots monitored over a 10-year period occasionally switched in different
   years from producing almost exclusively staminate to almost exclusively
   pistillate flowers, and vice versa. Sex ratios within plots changed over
   time because of variable sexual expression between years rather than
   differential mortality. Once trees were established, mortality was low.
   4. It is suggested that non-random spatial distributions in older 0.
   tenera trees in the natural population may be caused by labile sexual
   expression modified by the presence of neighbouring trees.}},

   in the canopy. Leaf population dynamics were examined for variability
   within and between several spatial scales: canopy heights, individual
   trees, species, and rain-forest formations.
   2. Representative species were selected within each of the three major
   rain-forest formations of New South Wales: Nothofagus moorei and
   Doryphora sassafras in cool-temperate or montane or mossy microphyll
   forest, D. sassafras and Ceratopetalum apetalum in warm-temperate or
   simple notophyll vine forest, and Dendrocnide excelsa, D. sassafras and
   Toona australis in subtropical or complex notophyll vine forest.
   Technical climbing apparatus was used to gain access to the canopy,
   where leaves were permanently marked and monitored on a monthly basis
   for up to 12 years.
   3. Three main leafing patterns were observed: seasonal growth - leaves
   flushed synchronously (e.g. N. moorei, T. australis); intermittent
   growth - leaves flushed over several months (e.g. D. sassafras, C.
   apetalum); and continuous growth - leaves flushed throughout the year
   (e.g. D. excelsa).
   4. Leaf lifespans were variable, ranging from short-lived leaves (D.
   excelsa, approximately 6 months), to annual leaves (T. australis), and
   longer-lived leaves (e.g. D. sassafras, ranging from 2 to 12 or more
   years). Shaded leaves lived longer than sun-exposed leaves, and those on
   trees at montane sites generally lived longer than leaves on individuals
   of the same species at lower altitudes.
   5. Significantly different proportions of leaf area were lost throughout
   the lifespan of a leaf in various species: T. australis (4.5\%); D.
   sassafras (16.6\%); C. apetalum (22\%); N. moorei (31\%); and D. excelsa
   (32.5\%). Shade leaves and young leaves were more extensively grazed
   than sun leaves and old leaves, respectively. Leaves located nearer to
   ground level suffered greater herbivory, although this may be in part an
   interaction with light regime.
   6. The measurements on herbivory, senescence, and longevity were used to
   calculated annual turnover of canopy material to either primary
   decomposers (through leaf fall), or primary consumers (through
   herbivory) in the three rain-forest formations. In a hectare of the
   subtropical forest, approximately 1.76t (14\%) and 5.59 t (46\%) were
   allocated each year to herbivores and decomposers, respectively, from a
   total canopy of 12.26 t. In the warm-temperate forest, 2.5 t (22\%) and
   4.05 t (35\%) were allocated annually to herbivores and decomposers,
   respectively, from a canopy of 11.41 t. In the cool-temperate forest, an
   estimated 2.63 t (27\%) and 3.53 t (37\%) went to herbivores and
   decomposers, respectively, from a total canopy of 9.69t.}},

   parasitization varied significantly over time and among locations.
   Diadegma insulare (Cresson) was the most abundant parasitoid of P.
   xylostella. It parasitized up to 100\% (range 0-100) and accounted for
   74-100\% of the total parasitization. Cotesia rubecula Marshall was the

Abstract = {{Lime stabilized septage was applied to an Evesboro loamy sand soil at
   rates of 66,300 and 747,000 L/ha. Corn was grown on half of the plots
   and the other half of the plots were left fallow. Corn yields varied
   from 2030 to 3550 kg/ha. Ground-water monitoring data indicates the
   septage did not cause nitrate or bacteria contamination. Lead
   concentrations increased slightly in the soil profile after the septage
   was applied.  There was no change in phosphorus, calcium, magnesium,
   potassium, manganese, zinc or copper concentrations. Nitrate was leached
   out of the top 150 cm of the soil profile during the winter months.
   Regulations recently adopted by the Delaware Department of Natural
   Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) for land application of
   sludges requires that all sludges be stabilized. Septage is classified
   as a sludge. In Sussex County, Delaware, many of the coastal
   developments are on individual septic tanks that are pumped every three
   to five years.  There is also a large rural population in the County
   that have on-site wastewater systems. Most of the septage generated in
   Sussex County is applied to agricultural land. One method to stabilize
   septage is to add lime and increase the pH to above 12.0 for several
   hours.
   A lime stabilization project was initiated at the University of Delaware
   in cooperation with DNREC to characterize septage in Sussex County and
   to determine the impact of various septage loading rates and lime
   loading rates and field conditions on soil properties and ground-water
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Ornate rock lobsters Panulirus omatus, which emigrate from Torres Strait
   (north-east Australia) to breed each year, support a seasonal artisanal
   lobster fishery at Yule Island (eastern Gulf of Papua). The catches are
   highest in mid-January through mid-February, but then decline rapidly,
   so by late-March virtually no lobsters remain. It has been hypothesised
   that most of the decline in catch is due to natural mortality caused by
   the stress of migrating and breeding. However, there are alternative
   explanations: fishing mortality may be extremely high, or lobsters may
   move to deeper habitat, not accessible to divers. These hypotheses were
   examined through a combination of (i) deploying tangle nets in deep
   water near the main fishing area, (ii) daily monitoring of the catch and
   effort of the artisanal fishery, (iii) a tag-recapture study and (iv)
   daily assessment of physiological condition, using the water content of
   the hepatopancreas as an index. The tangle net catches showed that
   female lobsters temporarily moved into deeper water just off the reef to
   hatch their eggs at the January and February full moons, but then moved
   back onto the reef. Their emigration did not coincide with the decline
   in artisanal catch. The annual instantaneous total mortality rates
   (Z(ann)), estimated from catch per unit effort (CPUE) curves, were
   extremely high: Z(ann) = 11.6 for females and Z(ann) = 12.0 for males.
   About one-third of the tags were returned. Analysis of the tag-return
   rate and total catch suggested the initial population was 19000-30000
   lobsters. The total mortality rate, estimated from the tag-recapture
   data (Z(ann) = 10.2), was consistent with the very high estimate from
   CPUE data. The annual instantaneous fishing mortality rate indicated
   that the fishery was responsible for about one-third of the mortality
   (Z(ann) = 4.4), which corresponded well with the proportion of tags
   returned. The remainder of the decline in catch was attributed to
   natural mortality. The hepatopancreas water content indicated that most
   lobsters were in poor condition. These results support the original
   hypothesis that there is extremely high mortality in this breeding
   population, a phenomenon not reported in any other species of lobster.}},

   were quick, included audio descriptions and identifications, and gave
   results that could be reviewed in the field. Individual video frames of
   quadrats were selected, digitized, and analysed using digital image
   processing. A color montage of the processed quadrat files demonstrate
   how digital image segmentation can be used to obtain direct area
   estimates of cover and help visualize results. Although faster, less
   direct point estimates undersample, resulting in significantly higher
   total cover values (alpha = 0.05). Images can be compactly stored on

   Black-backed Gull Larus marinus (Linnaeus) on adult Jonah crabs Cancer
   borealis (Stimpson) was examined using exclusion cages at two
   rocky-shore sites on the coast of New Hampshire, USA. During the summer
   of 1990, crabs were tethered in exclusion and control replicates, and
   survival monitored over two daytime low tides. Exclusion of gulls
   significantly enhanced crab survival, especially in lower tidal zones,
   and survival was higher overall during spring tides. The use of algal
   and crevice refuges significantly enhanced survival of crabs, especially
   at one site. Gulls may significantly depress densities of crabs in tidal
   zones accessible to them, limit the upper distribution of subtidal
   invertebrate species and influence the organization of intertidal
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding and movement rates of Acanthaster planci (L.) were measured
   by monitoring tagged individuals on Davies and Little Broadhurst Reefs
   in the central Great Barrier Reef. Measurements were made on four
   occasions between October 1987 and October 1988. New samples (n = 20) of
   starfish were monitored each time. Feeding rates in summer (October
   samples) were about twice that in winter (June sample) but were
   significantly depressed following the summer spawning season (January
   sample). Large adult A. planci (greater-than-or-equal-to 40 cm) killed a
   mean of 161 cm2 of coral.d-1 in winter and 357-478 cm2.d-1 in summer.
   Smaller starfish (20-39 cm) killed 66 cm2.d-1 and 155-234 cm2.d-1 in
   winter and summer, respectively. Movement rates of A. planci averaged
   2.8 m.d-1 at Davies Reef (low density starfish/high coral cover) and
   10.3 m.d-1 at Little Broadhurst Reef (high density/low coral). Within
   the Davies Reef population movement rates were highest in areas of low
   coral cover and large starfish were more mobile than smaller ones. These
   accurate measurements of feeding rate of A. planci on the Great Barrier
   Reef for the first time have important implications for management of
   coral reefs. Thus, modelling starfish density, coral cover and feeding
   rate indicates that A. planci populations can fluctuate by several
   orders of magnitude without causing noticeable coral damage. A threshold
   level of 1000 A. planci.km-2 (10.ha-1) is proposed as the limit above
   which depletion of live coral cover on reefs will occur. Control of
   starfish to much below this level would be of little benefit.}},

   positively related to both shell length and heterozygosity at seven
   putative enzyme loci. Heterozygosity at locus Pgm-l was significantly
   higher in the sample of survivors than in the control; this was also
   observed in a sample of individuals monitored over a malaigue induced in

   mechanism of resistance to anoxic stress, but a genetic explanation

Abstract = {{Caged populations of the almond moth, Cadra cautella (Walker), that were
   resistant to malathion were subjected to the release of susceptible
   males at various ratios. The effects of introducing malathion
   susceptible males into the population were monitored by determining the
   LD50s for 21 day old larvae from each population. F1 hybrid larvae were
   found to be intermediate in resistance between larvae from the parental
   strains, and resistance appeared to be inherited in a codominant
   fashion. Populations which received only a single release of males were,
   in general, more malathion susceptible the greater the introduction
   ratio (except at a ratio of 20:1). Larger populations subjected to
   repeated introductions of susceptible males showed a clear trend of
   decreasing larval survival after malathion treatment with increasing
   release ratio (including the 20:1 ratio). These results indicated that
   desirable alleles, such as those for insecticide susceptibility, can be
   introduced into established populations, and that this line of research
   should be given more emphasis in preventing development of resistance or
   in ameliorating established resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The wide acceptance of predation as the major limiting and/or regulatory
   factor on moose (Alces alces) populations is premature because
   assumptions have not been addressed, alternative hypotheses have not
   been given similar consideration, and adequate experiments have not been
   conducted.  I evaluated the empirical information available to assess
   the role of predation in the population dynamics of North American
   moose.  Studies that estimated losses of adult moose to wolves (Canis
   lupus), or monitored losses by radio telemetry, indicate that wolf
   predation is a limiting factor with a magnitude equal to or less than
   other sources of mortality (particularly hunting).  Three studies found
   that brown (Ursus arctos) and black (Ursus americanus) bears can take
   50\% of calves and that these losses represent the most significant
   mortality factor.  Predation rates by wolves or bears generally do not
   seem to be density dependent.  Experimental reduction of wolves produced
   increases in calf survival in 2 of 5 cases, but significant increases in
   density in only 1 instance.  Bears have been removed in 3 instances and
   calf survival has been improved in each case.  I reviewed 4
   predator-moose hypotheses and outlined their specific predictions. 
   Presently, empirical data are inadequate to test among them, and 2
   experiments are required to do so.  Moose densities should be reduced in
   one and bears and wolves should be removed in another; both should be
   followed by monitoring of changes in moose population.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of the planktonic, phototrophic ciliate
   Mesodinium rubrum was monitored during a red-water event in daylight
   hours, over a complete tidal cycle. Theoretical considerations based
   upon the hydrodynamics of the estuary, and upon the behaviour of the
   ciliate described to date, suggest that the population should not be
   able to resist flushing losses from the estuary. However, field
   observations reveal a pattern consisting of aggregation close to the
   surface during flood tide and high water, but dispersion away from the
   surface on the ebb tide, thus minimizing flushing losses due to the
   strong superficial currents. Evidence is presented suggesting that the
   major cue for such migration may be the turbulence generated by shearing
   of surface currents, or gravitational (static) instability of surface
   water.}},

   organochlorines showed. P4501A induction, others with similar body
   burdens did not. Differential denaturation of hepatic P450 to P420
   occurred in both MTWT and longnose suckers (LNSK), which presumably also
   caused differential inactivation of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase
   activity. Thus, immunoblotting was employed to determine P4501A specific
   content. LNSK, which showed lower levels of organochlorines, exhibited
   modest P4501A increases. These results emphasize the migratory nature of
   MTWT and indicate that caution is required in interpreting chemical or
   biomarker data in isolation: chemical burdens did not always correlate
   with P450]A induction.}},

Abstract = {{Within the past 6 yr biological and ecological techniques for monitoring
   effects of pollutants have developed rapidly. Techniques are now
   available which approach chemical techniques in their sensitivity and
   which show pollution effects at sites hitherto not suspected of being
   polluted. Future developments of such techniques, it is suggested, are
   likely to involve development of better water and sediment bioassay
   techniques. Molecular biological techniques already show promise of
   revolutionizing approaches to effects monitoring. Finally, it is
   suggested that it is not necessary to demand that a given biological
   technique must show an effect at a higher level of organization than
   that at which it is tested (i.e. if induction of an enzyme in response
   to stress can be demonstrated, one does not need to show effects at
   population levels before regulatory action is taken).}},

Abstract = {{Snow tussock (Chionochloa macra and C flavescens ssp. brevis) population
   structures and seedling regeneration were investigated in 10
   montane-subalpine stands on formerly forested sites in the Harper-Avoca
   catchment, Canterbury, subjected to different histories of sheep grazing
   and browsing by European hares. Population structures were assessed by
   assigning individuals to four `'age-states'' based on basal diameter,
   number of tillers, height, and percent crown death: `'seedlings'',
   `'juvenile tussocks'', `'mature tussocks'', and `'senescent tussocks''.
   On areas subjected to c. 80 years of grazing by sheep, most snow
   tussocks had been destroyed. Remaining tussocks were predominantly
   senescent and seedlings were infrequent, suggesting a continuing decline
   in abundance. In contrast, stands retired from sheep-grazing for 34 or
   21 years were characterised by low proportions of senescent tussocks and
   high proportions (>60\%) of seedlings and juveniles, suggesting the
   onset of increases in tussock abundance. Population structures inside
   and outside a 10 year old exclosure showed that browsing by European
   hares alone was capable of inhibiting C macra recovery. In retired
   stands, snow tussock seedlings were most frequent within 70 cm of mature
   tussocks, on microsites protected from frost-heave by short ground-tier
   vegetation (e.g., bryophyte mats). A lack of seedling regeneration on
   heavily grazed/browsed sites reflected the low basal area and poor
   vigour of the tussocks remaining as seed sources. Balanced management of
   tussock grasslands for conservation and production urgently requires
   further knowledge of successional processes and how these are altered by
   different levels of grazing and burning under different environmental
   conditions. Age-state analysis appears useful for assessing tussock
   population responses to management. Comparison of sites subjected to
   historically different management offers an approach that complements
   experimental or monitoring studies.}},

   to determine whether the 1080 poison used to eradicate possums and

   There was no significant decline in bird numbers recorded immediately
   after poisoning, with four species increasing in abundance (P<0.001).
   Twelve months after the operation the abundance of four species had
   increased significantly (P<0.001). The poisoning does not appear to have
   had any negative effect on the bird populations of Rangitoto, while the
   removal of browsing mammals may in future prove to have beneficial
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Close monitoring of the lepidopteran leafroller Cnephasia jactatana
   under laboratory colonisation revealed few distinct effects of
   successive rearing on artificial diet on the life cycle. The second
   laboratory generation had a prolonged development time and altered sex
   synchronism in pupation and eclosion patterns. Some deleterious changes
   were observed in later generations, including decreases in fertility,
   egg hatch and sperm motility, failure of mating adults to separate, and
   pupal and adult malformations. These changes were not adaptive, but were
   due to incompatibility with the general purpose dict (GPD) used; they
   were absent under sub-colonisation on a sheepnut-bean based diet (SBD).
   Success in the laboratory colonisation of C. jactatana is attributed to
   a random mating protocol, choice of environmental conditions
   representing the wild habitat, and a rapid rate of population growth.}},

Abstract = {{Occurrence and diet of ten carnivorous predators (four falconiforms,
   four owls, and two foxes), and population levels of their mammalian
   prey, were monitored over 45 months at a semi-arid site in north-central
   Chile.  Early in this period, small mammals irrupted and then declined
   markedly to a density 7\% of that at peak.  All four falconiforms (Buteo
   polyosoma, Falco sparverius, Geranoaetus melanoleucus, Parabuteo
   unicinctus) and one owl (Tyto alba) responded numerically to the decline
   in mammalian prey by virtually abandoning the study site.  The three
   other owls (Athene cunicularia, Bubo virginianus, Glaucidium nanum) and
   the two foxes (Pseudalopex culpaeus and P. griseus) remained.  With few
   exceptions, throughout the study predators maintained species-specific
   preferences among small mammal species regardless of the absolute and
   proportional abundance of these prey.  At no time did the two prey
   species most responsible for the irruption (the rodents Phyllotis
   darwini and Akodon olivaceus) occur in predators' diets out of
   proportion to their estimated relative abundance in the field. 
   Predators were clearly unable to prevent the irruption from occurring. 
   Given the absence of a clear functional response to the most irruptive
   species, predators seemed unlikely to have been responsible for the
   observed crash.  At present, however, predators may be prolonging the
   crash and delaying the return of small-mammal populations to typical
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates breeding success of 78 (25 yearling and 53 adult)
   Black Grouse females in central Sweden.  Black Grouse females were
   captured and radiomarked in late winter or early spring.  Females were
   monitored from egglaying until late July/early August when broods were
   flushed.  Yearlings were significantly smaller (body weight and wing
   length) than adult females captured at leks.  All yearlings made
   breeding attempts.  Yearlings laid significantly smaller first clutches
   and eggs than adult females.  Nest predation was similar for both age
   classes but yearlings had a lower tendency to renest.  More yearlings
   than adult females lost their entire brood during the 5 weeks after
   hatching, 82\% vs 35\%, respectively.  Only 2 of 25 (8\%) yearlings
   raised chicks to 5 weeks of age compared with 20 of 50 adult females
   (40\%).  Adult birds raised on average 1.72 chicks per female compared
   with 0.16 for yearlings.  Mechanisms that can explain the age-specific
   breeding success, such as maternal condition and territorial behaviour
   are discussed.  It is suggested that the large difference in
   age-specific breeding success observed in this study was a result of the
   overall habitat structure in the area.}},

Abstract = {{A residual bioassay was used to determine insecticide susceptibility in
   populations of Colarado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say),
   in eastern North Carolina. Mean bioassay mortalities were subjected to
   correlation analysis to assess patterns of resistance among tested
   insecticides. Within insecticide classes, cross-resistance patterns were
   observed between carbaryl and carbofuran (carbamates), fenvalerate and
   permethrin (pyrethroids), and among azinphosmethyl, methamidophos, and
   phosmet (organophosphates). Significant associations between
   insecticides from different insecticide classes were concluded to be due
   to multiple resistance. Knowledge of multiple and cross-resistance
   patterns are discussed in relation to the bioassay as a tool for
   monitoring insecticide resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory selection with diflubenzuron (DFB) and cyromazine (CYR) was
   carried out with strains of houseflies collected on Danish farms. The
   adult flies were multiresistant to organophosphorus. carbamate and
   pyrethroid insecticides. Susceptibility to the larvicidal effect of DFB
   or CYR was monitored on Danish farms where fly control with DFB or CYR
   had been carried out for one to nine years. On these farms the fly
   population continued during the winter, but at a low level.
   Four strains were selected with DFB in seven out of 13-18 laboratory
   generations. The selections varied from 56\% to 94\% mortality. The
   strains showed 1-5 times increase of LC50 and LC95 to DFB. The
   larvicidal effect of DFB was monitored on five farms where treatment of
   fly breeding sources in manure (1 g DFB m-2) was carried out regularly
   for one to nine fly seasons. On none of the farms was any general
   increase of tolerance to DFB found. Resistance ratios (R/S) compared to
   the WHO Standard Reference Strain ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 at LC50 and
   from 1.0 to 2.9 at LC95.
   Two strains were selected with CYR in five or six out of 13 laboratory
   generations. The selections varied from 62 to 97\% mortality. The
   strains showed no increase of LC50 or LC95. The larvicidal effect of CYR
   was monitored on three farms where housefly breeding places in the
   animal houses were treated with CYR (0.5 g m-2) for two fly seasons. No
   reduction of susceptibility to CYR was found and the R/S was 0.7 to 0.9.
   The effect of DFB or CYR selection pressure is compared with other
   investigations and discussed. Moderate to high resistance to DFB or CYR
   can develop in housefly populations if the selection pressure is strong,
   especially when used as feed-through applications on poultry farms where
   all feed contains DFB or CYR. If the treatment of fly breeding sources
   is less complete, resistance problems may not develop.}},

Journal = {{PESTICIDE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{147-152}},
Abstract = {{Toxicity measurements were made with three closely-related Bollworm
   species, Heliothis virescens F., Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and
   Helicoverpa armigera (Huebner) using insecticides of 3 different
   chemical classes. Tests were carried out by a leaf-dip method using
   neonate larval stages, a topical application test on 3rd larvae, and a
   topical test with imagines. H. armigera populations from Ivory Coast,
   Turkey, Thailand, and India were obtained and investigated. H. virescens
   originated from the USA and Colombia, and H. zea from Guatemala and
   Nicaragua. Resistance was expressed in all species, the sensitive
   reference strains having similar LC50s in tests with monocrotophos,
   profenofos, thiodicarb, and methomyl. Since resistance appeared not to
   be a quality related to species but rather a feature common to all of
   the samples investigated, its origin must be connected with the type of
   cotton culture and the selection pressure they were subjected to in
   their respective agro-ecosystem. Resistance was highest for
   monocrotophos and cypermethrin in Central American countries,
   differences in the treatment regime being reflected by the resistance
   levels attained. In all stages tested, resistance was sufficiently well
   expressed to make a monitoring system based on neonate larvae, the 3rd
   larval stage, or imagines of the species possible. The final decision as
   to which should be used for a general, comparative monitoring system,
   therefore, should be governed by the technical parameters of the testing
   process.}},

   were detected, one in May-June and the other during September-October

Abstract = {{Changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of the mRNAs for the
   chlorophyll-a/b-binding-protein gene (Cab) in cotyledons from developing
   soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) seedlings were studied. Cab mRNAs could
   be detected in the polysomal polyadenylated poly(A)+ mRNA population of
   cotyledons within 3 d after start of imbibition, prior to their
   emergence from soil, and declined prior to the onset of cotyledonary
   senescence. The Cab mRNA levels were compared to the levels of rbcS
   (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit) mRNAs in
   cotyledons and distinct differences in their expression programs were
   noted. Quantitative analyses with S1 nuclease were used to monitor the
   accumulation of the mRNAs of individual members of the Cab gene family.
   Cab 3, Cab 4, and Cab 5 mRNAs were differentially regulated in the
   cotyledons during post-germinative development. Cab 4 was the most
   abundant Cab gene mRNA representing approx. 4.3\% of the cotyledonary
   polysomal poly(A)+ mRNA population. In-situ hybridizations using
   methacrylate-imbedded tissue and H-3-antisense- and -sense-strand RNA
   probes were used to determine the qualitative and quantitative
   distribution of Cab RNAs in cotyledonary cells. Cab RNAs were most
   abundant in the palisade cells. These results indicate an interaction of
   both developmental and environmental cues in modulating the expression
   of the Cab gene family in soybean cotyledons.}},

Abstract = {{A survey based on a statistically representative sample of 5000
   dwellings distributed in 200 administrative districts has been planned
   in Italy to evaluate the average exposure indoors. Knowledge of the
   distribution of radon concentration and gamma absorbed doses in air
   allows a determination of the average risk to which the population is
   subjected and of the number of dwellings exceeding a given action level.
   Radon concentration is monitored for two 6 month periods, while the y
   exposure is measured for only one semester. Duplicate radon measurements
   are performed by using etched track detectors (typically LR-115 II type
   and CR-39). The survey is carried out at district level by local
   laboratories, under the coordination of the two central institutions
   ENEA/DISP and ISS. The overall structure of the survey is described
   together with the first results obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of culture
   medium and incubation temperature on bovine uterine and oviduct
   epithelial cell growth, so that the most efficient combination could
   then be used to develop a co-culture system for bovine embryos. In the
   first experiment, uterine and oviduct epithelial cells at either the
   second or third subpassage were incubated for 8 days at 37-degrees-C
   with 5\% CO2 in Tissue Culture Medium-199, CMRL-1066, Minimal Essential
   Medium, Menezo's B2 or Ham's F-12 medium. In addition to plotting growth
   curves of cell populations, the cell cycle was monitored for 8 days by
   flow cytometry. Uterine and oviduct epithelial cells incubated in
   CMRL-1066 exhibited the highest growth rates during the 8-day culture
   period. However, there were no differences in cell cycle analysis among
   treatment groups during the incubation period. In the second experiment,
   CMRL-1066 medium was used to evaluate growth and proliferation of
   uterine and oviduct epithelial cells incubated at 37-degrees-C or
   39-degrees-C; temperature had no significant effect on growth rates or
   proliferation rates for either uterine or oviduct cells during the 8-day
   incubation. In the third experiment, the more promising culture media
   for epithelial cell culture studies were chosen for in vitro maturation
   and subsequent in vitro fertilization (IVF) of bovine oocytes. Early
   cleavage-stage embryos produced by IVF procedures were subsequently
   cultured in vitro for 7 days in medium alone or with oviduct epithelial
   cells. In this study, the culture medium did not influence fertilization
   or cleavage rates. However, more embryos co-cultured with oviduct
   epithelial cells were considered viable after 7 days of incubation
   compared with embryos incubated in medium alone. These results indicate
   that various incubation conditions can influence the growth of bovine
   uterine and oviduct epithelial cells in vitro. However, in spite of
   changes in cell growth patterns, there does not appear to be a change in
   their embryotropic capabilities in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution patterns of 21 species of euphausiids collected during
   eight research cruises extending from 17-degrees 30' to 32-degrees 30'S
   and offshore to 135 miles were studied by means of Principal Component
   Analysis. The existence of possible environmental borders for
   zooplankton populations was explored and discussed in relation to the
   main hydrographic features of the Benguela upwelling system. Three main
   boundaries were identified: the shelf-break zone; the area between 19
   and 20-degrees-S; and the northernmost extension of the Luderitz
   upwelling cell (24-degrees 30'S). The first boundary separates inshore
   and shelf species from shelf-break and oceanic species, revealing the
   boundary between shelf and oceanic circulation. It is reinforced by the
   strong equatorward and poleward flows that occur over the shelf-break at
   different depths. The boundary at 19-20-degrees-S was related to the
   general surface, wind-driven flow of the Benguela and its interaction
   with the Angola Current. Knowledge of the temporal variability
   associated with this boundary may well be enhanced by monitoring the
   extension of the proposed indicator species, Euphausia americana and E.
   gibboides. The turbulent regime associated with the perennial activity
   of the Luderitz upwelling cell defines the third main boundary zone. It
   partially separates inshore species of the northern and southern
   Benguela and reflects the relative dominance of cross-shelf or
   alongshore currents.}},

Abstract = {{There are two types of interactions between seals and commercial
   fisheries in South Africa: biological (potential competition for shared
   resources between the two `'predators'') and operational (conflicts
   during fishing operations). Using data for the 1980s. a comparison is
   made of relative consumption by different predators in South African
   waters. Seals and fisheries are not the major consumers in the system,
   but they do take comparable amounts. This has resulted in calls for a
   reduction in the seal population, but to date, no studies have shown
   that reducing seal predation of commercial species will make more fish
   available for the fisheries. Most fisheries are subject to some form of
   operational interaction with seals. These interactions include
   consumption of catches (operational consumption), disturbance of fishing
   operations (operational disturbance) and damage to fishing gear
   (operational gear damage); they vary in degree of severity, both
   seasonally and regionally. Estimates of the consumption by seals from
   fishing operations in South Africa show it to be a minimal percentage of
   fishery catches and a small proportion of the total predation by seals.
   Preliminary calculations of overall economic losses resulting from seal
   interference show this to be small in comparison with the wholesale
   value of the catches- Seals die as a result of fishing operations, and
   estimates of the potential mortality through entanglement, drowning and
   deliberate killing indicate this mortality to be of a magnitude that
   should be monitored.}},

Abstract = {{Historical and contemporary data on Benguela seabirds assumed to be
   responsive to changes in food availability are reviewed as potential
   indicators and predictors of change in the ecosystem. Cyclic variations
   in the annual yields of seabird products evident at decadal long
   time-scales may reflect fluctuations in prey populations at similar
   periods. However, no such relationship has been demonstrated and
   consequently the value of such annual yields as indicators is not
   proved. More recently. interannual variation in diets, foraging effort,
   breeding success and chick growth of two of the three most abundant
   species of seabird in the ecosystem have been examined in relation to
   changes in prey abundance. Although the relative abundance of important
   forage species ii the diets of both species of seabird have reflected
   regional changes in the absolute abundance of these prey, changes in the
   values of other parameters thought to reflect food availability were not
   consistently correlated between and within species. This indicates poor
   potential for their use as indicators of change at least over the range
   of abundances experienced in this study. Under present management
   protocol, data from seabirds do not nor are likely to provide abundance
   indices that may be used directly in stock assessment of commercially
   important species. To date. insights into distribution and migration of
   pelagic fish provided by seabird-derived data probably represent the
   most valuable contribution of birds to fisheries scientists studying the
   Benguela system.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic analysis of enzymes and proteins enables aquaculturists
   to distinguish among stocks of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and
   blue catfish I. furcatus, and to monitor gene flow, hybridization, and
   inbreeding. Sixteen previously unreported genetic markers allow much
   more precise resolution of stock differences. Analysis of low-risk
   tissue samples (caudal fin, adipose fin, and barbels) enables
   investigators to obtain genetic data with little stress on individual
   fish. We have identified at least 69 enzyme locus products in
   populations of channel catfish (Kansas, Marion, ``Auburn,{''}
   Mississippi, and Red River strains) and blue catfish by use of autopsied
   tissues. Polymorphic loci account for at least 36\% of the loci
   examined. Allelic polymorphisms fixed between blue and channel catfish
   were observed at 13 loci. Genetic variation was observed at 17 loci
   among channel catfish populations and at 5 loci in the single blue
   catfish population. Analysis of species-specific genetic markers among
   approximately 400 sampled individuals resulted in detection of two blue
   catfish that had been misidentified in channel catfish populations as
   well as four interspecific hybrids. Low-risk tissue samples allowed
   adequate resolution of 54 (77\%) of the gene products examined. The
   ability to resolve at least 50 enzyme locus products from barbel samples
   alone will facilitate future genetic studies of populations for which
   sacrifice of individual brood fish is undesirable.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic plants have been controlled in a series of relatively small
   public-use areas in Guntersville Reservoir on the Tennessee River in
   northern Alabama. We investigated the effects of herbicide use
   (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, diquat dibromide,
   copper-ethylenediamine complex) and vegetation reduction on movements
   and population characteristics of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides
   at six sites (5-10 hectares) in this 27,479-hectare impoundment. Fish
   were sampled by electrofishing, and relative vegetation density was
   monitored periodically through a 100-d period in late summer and fall of
   1989. The locations and movements of 29 largemouth bass were monitored
   at four study sites with radiotelemetry. Three sites were treated with
   herbicides applied from airboats, and three control sites were traversed
   by airboats to simulate herbicide application. Largemouth bass catch
   rates (catch/1,000 s of electrofishing) did not change in response to
   herbicide treatment; mean total length of largemouth bass did not differ
   by site or time relative to herbicide treatment. Largemouth bass
   condition declined during the study period, and the rate of decline did
   not differ among sites. Movements of radio-marked largemouth bass were
   limited (< 300 m) and largely confined to the study sites. Differences
   among sites, herbicide treatments, and vegetation density had no
   measurable effect on the movements of largemouth bass. Overall, the
   results of this study provide no evidence that localized herbicide
   applications changed the abundance, size structure, condition, or
   movement of largemouth bass.}},

Abstract = {{The Quebec Lake Survey (QLS) was conducted as part of the Quebec Spatial
   Lake Acidity monitoring network (RESSALQ).  A total of 1253 lakes were
   visited at winter-time between 1986 and 1990, to quantify and to
   extrapolate the water quality status of a statistically representative
   set of lakes to the target lake population of five subregions.  Water
   quality is strongly influenced by terrain characteristics.  The airborne
   anthropogenic pollution also influences greatly the water chemistry of
   lakes in areas receiving high SO4 depositions.  Within the QLS study
   area, the Cote-Nord subregion is the most sensitive and the most
   affected by acidity.  Yet, these acidic conditions can be mostly
   explained by the combination of an important organic acid contribution
   and the extreme sensitivity of the area.  The Outaouais and Abitibi
   areas also present great proportions of acidic lakes.  The acidity of
   these lakes originates mostly from anthropogenic sources.}},

Abstract = {{Ethylene glycol is regularly used as an industrial solvent and in
   vehicular anti-freeze and de-icing compounds. Significant quantities of
   it are released into treatment streams and onto land. The aim of this
   study was to establish rates of biodegradation of ethylene glycol in
   simulated subsurface environments. The utilization of ethylene glycol as
   substrate by microorganisms naturally occurring in soil and groundwater
   was monitored over time while substrate concentration, soil type,
   temperature and nutrient level were varied. Batch studies at 100 and
   1000-ppm ethylene glycol demonstrated that increasing substrate
   concentration decreased the rate of its biotransformation as the
   first-order kinetic rate constant decreased from 1.01 to 0.95 days-1.
   Further increase in initial concentration to 10,000-ppm resulted in
   minimal substrate disappearance from solution which was likely due to
   oxygen limitation. Studies with two different soils under identical
   environmental conditions and substrate concentrations indicated soil
   type had a clear effect on biodegradation rate . Lowering the
   temperature from 25-degrees to 10-degrees-C for a given soil retarded
   the degradation rate by a factor of 2.44, but at each temperature
   greater than 99\% removal was achieved in less than 7 days. Removal of
   nutritional amendments from the microbial population had only a slight
   impact on biotransformation rate. Unamended microcosms still exhibited
   nearly complete ethylene glycol transformation in 3 days as compared to
   2 days for amended microcosms. Groundwater served as a satisfactory
   bacterial inoculum and generated a rate constant only slightly lower
   (0.76 days-1) than that found for the soils. All results were comparable
   to those found by others for the biotransformation of linear
   alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) or of ethylene glycol by activated sludge.}},

Abstract = {{The Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO) is an
   interstate agency created in 1948 to administer a state compact which
   calls for the abatement of water pollution in the Ohio Valley. Since
   1975, ORSANCO has conducted routine monitoring programs to detect the
   presence of toxic chemicals in the Ohio River and in fish taken from the
   river. Such information is particularly important as the Ohio River, a
   major river in the United States, serves as a water supply to over three
   million people and is used extensively for recreational purposes. The
   monitoring results have shown several problems: contamination of fish
   tissue by PCBs and chlordane, concentrations of certain metals which
   exceed chronic aquatic life criteria in 10 to 25 percent of the samples
   analyzed, and levels of certain volatile organic compounds which
   exceeded criteria established to prevent one additional cancer per one
   million population in almost half the samples analyzed.
   In 1986, the Commission initiated a Toxic Substances Control Program
   which was designed to identify sources of the toxics problems and
   prescribe corrective actions. Because of the multitude of potential
   sources of toxics along the Ohio, the river was divided into seven
   segments for intensive study. To date, studies have been initiated on
   four segments. In addition, special topic studies have been conducted on
   the river as a whole to address the suitability of the river as a source
   of drinking water, trends in parameter levels, and the relationship
   between surface and ground water quality. Findings to date: Point source
   discharges to the river do not cause widespread toxics problems.
   Nonpoint sources, including urban runoff and contaminated ground water,
   are significant sources of toxics to the river. Levels of certain toxics
   in tributaries are also an important source. Under ``normal{''}
   situations (i.e., excluding spills), the Ohio River provides a suitable
   source water for public supply after appropriate treatment. Levels of
   many metals and volatile organic compounds have decreased over the past
   10 years.}},

Abstract = {{This study is being conducted to investigate the biodegradation of
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in contaminated soil
   using composting technology. Pyrene, a four-ring aromatic hydrocarbon,
   was chosen as a model PAH compound for the study. Preliminary
   investigations were carried out to assess the feasibility of soil
   composting by monitoring (a) carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio, (b)
   microbial consortia diversity, (c) coefficient of permeability and (d)
   moisture content. The soil was augmented with composted sludge, which
   was used as a bulking agent and nutrient supplement, in quantities
   ranging from 0-50\% dry weight basis. Tests were conducted in both batch
   and continuous composters. In the batch composter, forty grams of
   soil/sludge mixtures in different proportions were spiked with 13.5
   mg/kg (dry weight basis) of unlabeled pyrene. The batch composters were
   aerated and placed in a constant temperature water bath for a period of
   21 days. Samples were soxhelet extracted and analyzed on the High
   Performance Liquid Chromatograph to determine the reduction in pyrene
   concentration. Analysis of these samples is in progress. In the
   continuous composter, the soil/sludge mixtures are spiked with both
   labeled and un-labeled pyrene to obtain a total radio-activity of 13.5
   muci. This process is being monitored for temperature, moisture content,
   volatile solids and microbial population. Mineralization of pyrene is
   assessed by quantifying (CO2)-C-14 produced.}},

Abstract = {{The Chesapeake Bay, while a significant habitat for fisheries resources,
   is in actuality an aquatic `'bedroom community'', as many of the
   economically important species are seasonally transient. The pressure on
   these resources due to their demand for human consumption and
   recreation, proximity to extensive industrial activity along the shores,
   and climate scale environmental fluctuations has resulted in stock
   declines by most important species.  Our inability to separate natural
   population fluctuations from those of anthropogenic origin complicates
   management efforts. The only way to make these separations, and
   subsequent informed management decisions is by supporting long-term
   stock assessment programs (monitoring) in the Bay which allow us to
   examine trends, cycles and stochastic processes between resource and
   environment. These programs need to monitor both recruitment and fishing
   mortality rates of the economically important species, and to identify
   and monitor the environmentally sensitive `'canary'' species.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with fast procedures adopted for starting-up anaerobic
   digesters treating biological wastes. In particular, results related to
   the behaviour of a digester treating sewage sludge with a fast start-up

   compared with those related to a passage from mesophilic to thermophilic
   temperatures (from 37 to 55-degrees-C, in 31 days) and to a direct
   re-start-up under thermophilic conditions (27 days). In the latter
   cases, the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes was digested. Main
   findings concern: the identification of two retention times as the
   necessary period for reaching the first steady-state condition; the
   usefulness of performing a real time process monitoring the observation
   that thermophilic inoculum allows better digester performances in the
   first start-up period, a finding however, that requires more

Abstract = {{Since 1987 operators of municipal wastewater treatment plants, having

   annually. Generally, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn are monitored: since 1989
   Hg is becoming the centre of systematic attention. Occasional data are
   available on concentrated Ag, Co, As and Mo. These data were collected
   and ordered by the authors of the paper. On their basis lines of
   exceedance were plotted and sets were prepared, characterizing both
   localities with the common level of the sludge contamination, and with
   the extremely low contamination. level reflecting the condition that
   could be achieved if measures limiting the heavy metal input into public
   sewerage systems were adopted.
   The results achieved were compared with heavy metal concentration
   limits, as determined in the Industrial composts standard,both for raw
   materials used for the compost production, and for composts of Ist and
   IInd grades. With a view to the general environmental contamination, and

Title = {{COMPENSATORY MORTALITY IN A COLORADO MULE DEER POPULATION}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},

Abstract = {{A thorough test of the hypothesis of compensatory mortality is a
   fundamental requirement for a better understanding of the population
   dynamics of wildlife species.  This knowledge is vital, whether
   populations are managed for recreational hunting or other purposes.  Our
   research on a pinyon pine (Pinus edulis)-Utah juniper (Juniperus
   osteosperma) winter range in Piceance Basin, northwest Colorado, from
   1981 to 1988 tested for compensatory mortality in the fawn portion of a
   mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) population.
   Three experimental manipulations were used employing radio-collared
   deer.  In a field study, removing 16-22\% of the population from the
   treatment unit each winter for 2 years had no measurable effect on fawn
   survival rates as compared to rates on the control unit (P = 0.566).  We
   attributed this mostly to not removing enough deer to immediately affect
   fawn survival under existing range conditions.  In a controlled study,
   deer removed from the treatment unit were used to stock 3 large pastures
   at densities of 44, 89, and 133 deer/km2 to simulate hunting removals of
   67, 33, and 0\%, respectively.  Fawn survival rates varied inversely
   with density (P < 0.001).  Starvation was the leading cause of fawn
   mortality in all pastures indicating a nutritional limitation at all
   densities.  We believe the density-dependent survival response in the
   pastures demonstrated that a strong compensatory mortality process
   operated in this mule deer population.  In another field study, 49-77\%
   of fawns were killed by predators during 4 winters.  We then reduced the
   coyote (Canis latrans) population for 3 winters while we continued to
   monitor fawn mortality.  Predation rates decreased (P = 0.004) and
   starvation rates increased (P = 0.042) between pre- and posttreatment
   periods, but no change in fawn survival was detected (P = 0.842).  These
   results support those from the pastures even though the primary
   mortality causes differed.
   Mean fawn weights varied among years, study areas, and trap sites (P <
   0.001).  Male fawns averaged 2.4 and 3.0 kg heavier than females (P <
   0.001) on the 2 field-study areas.  Larger fawns had higher survival (P
   < 0.001), but size was not a significant predictor of whether or not a
   fawn starved (P = 0.237).  In both field-study areas, female fawns had
   higher survival than males (P < 0.001) when weight was a covariate, but
   not when weight was excluded (P = 0.697).  Adult females had higher
   survival rates than fawns (P < 0.001) even though adult rates were
   calculated over 5.5 more months.
   Vegetation biomass differed among pastures (P < 0.001), but differences
   were unrelated to fawn survival rates.  Biomass estimates indicated
   adequate forage was available in all pastures.  Tame deer in the low
   density pasture took more bites per 15-minute trial (P < 0.001), had
   shorter mean times between consecutive bites of Utah serviceberry
   (Amelanchier utahensis) and true mountainmahogany (Cercocarpus montanus)
   (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.002), and traveled less distance during
   afternoon trials (P = 0.015) than tame deer in the high density pasture.
   These differences were assumed to reflect lower forage quality in the
   high density pasture.
   For the Piceance Basin mule deer population, mortality rather than
   reproduction seemed the major process driving the density-dependent
   mechanism because the former fluctuated over a much broader range.  High
   survival of adult females, even during severe winters, tended to temper
   population fluctuations that can occur in harsher environments and
   allowed density-dependent processes in the fawn segment to continue
   operating.  With density-dependent population regulation, the common
   management strategy of decreasing harvest when fawn survival is low and
   increasing harvest when survival is high is counterproductive.}},

Abstract = {{The Australian sea-lion, Neophoca cinerea, has a 17-18-month breeding
   cycle on islands off the west coast of Western Australia. Buller, North
   Fisherman and Beagle Is are the main pupping sites, with several very
   small colonies (n greater-than-or-equal-to 3) at the Abrolhos Is. The
   4-5-month pupping seasons are synchronised at North Fisherman and Beagle
   Is, but the sea-lions from Buller 1. breed one month later and those
   from the Abrolhos Is two months earlier. Pup production and pup
   mortality were highly variable between seasons over which observations
   were recorded: 129 pups were born at the main breeding sites in early
   1988, the mortality in the first five months was 7.1 \%, whereas 181
   pups were born in late 1989 of which 24.3 \% died. Pups remain in the
   vicinity of their natal islands for the first 4-5 months of life before
   leaving, perhaps on foraging trips, with their mothers. Most return to
   their natal island, although others haulout on islands up to 27 km away.
   Some male N. cinerea congregate in bachelor colonies on islands adjacent
   to the Perth metropolitan region during the non-breeding season and
   migrate up to 280 km north each breeding season.
   The status of the isolated, west-coast N. cinerea population is unknown.
   The current high level of human pressure on sea-lion terrestrial
   habitats and their food resources indicate a need for further monitoring
   of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1975 and 1984, 105 radio-collared dingoes, Canis familiaris
   dingo, were tracked and observed from aircraft on the Fortescue River in
   Western Australia. The majority of dingoes were members of 18
   territorial packs, including four pairs. Five packs were monitored for
   more than three years. Most bitches became pregnant, including those
   9-10 months old, although not all litters were raised. Packs raised an
   average of 1 . 1 litters per year. Instances of packs raising the
   litters of two bitches in a year were recorded. The area (up to 400 km2)
   was covered initially (1975-78) by a mosaic of stable pack territories.
   Little emigration occurred and population density rose to a peak of 22 .
   2 dingoes per 100 km2 in 1978 due to an increase in pack size.
   Perturbations to the social system, including disintegration of some
   packs, an increase in emigration, shifts of pack territories and
   contraction of territories into the most favoured areas, coincided with
   high population density and a reduced food supply. After aerial baiting
   in 1980 killed all the dingoes from the study site, immigrants from
   surrounding areas established a new population. The increase in density
   was moderated by the formation of new pairs or packs that occupied
   surrounding vacant areas. The dispersal strategy of pack members was a
   major factor affecting the population density of dingoes in the study
   area.}},

Abstract = {{Autoradiography, immunocytochemistry, and microscopy were employed to
   study stem cells and their fates in experimentally decapitated and in
   asexually reproducing specimens of Microstomum lineare (O. F. Muller).
   Differentiation of the nervous system in developing zooids was monitored
   by the appearance of immunoreactivity to the neuropeptide FMRF/RF-amide
   and to the biogenic amine 5-HT. Labelling with {[}H-3]T (tritiated
   thymidine) provided a means to follow the proliferation of stem cells
   and their differentiation into nerve and other cell types both in the
   regenerating head end and in more posterior zooids produced by asexual
   reproduction. Initiation of development of a new zooid was characterized
   by immunoreactivity for 5-HT in the postpharyngeal commissure and in a
   cell group at its branching point with the parental lateral nerve cords;
   initiation of regeneration, on the other hand, was characterized by
   increased immunoreactivity for FMRF/RF-amide in the cut nerve ends.
   Antigenicity to FMRF/RF-amide antibody appeared before that to 5-HT in
   the developing brain as well as in the pharyngeal plexus.
   FMRF/RF-amide-positive neurons were not, however, found among
   differentiating nerve cells until dense-core vesicles appeared in their
   cytoplasm. The only cells incorporating tritiated thymidine ({[}H-3]T)
   were neoblasts in the mesenchyme and gastrodermis, which proliferate
   continuously, replenishing the population of stem cells available for
   growth, asexual reproduction, and regeneration. Two forms of the
   proliferative cells arose, one with and one without ciliary basal bodies
   in the cytoplasm. Even in completely regenerated specimens there were
   many labelled undifferentiated cells (i.e., 20-45 h after exposure to
   {[}H-3]T). I propose that neoblasts function both as stem cells for all
   differentiated cell types and as reserve cells with a determined life
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Feeding habits of free-ranging wildebeest and zebra were monitored in a
   semi-arid nature reserve, bordering the southwestern part of Kruger
   National Park, South Africa.  The purpose of study was to distinguish
   and define the feeding niches of two roughage grazers that occur in
   similar habitat types.  The monthly compositions of diets were evaluated
   by direct observations of feeding bouts over a period of two years when
   rainfall patterns were average and animal populations were stable. 
   Other analyses evaluated the standing biomass of grass species in the
   reserve during the wet summer and dry winter seasons.
   A considerable overlap of grass species composition was found in the
   diets of wildebeest and zebra.  Ordination of bi-monthly records of the
   diet composition showed greater variations in scores of grasses in zebra
   diet in comparison to wildebeest.  Seasonal patterns were more apparent
   in the wildebeest diet.  Preference ranking of grass species indicated
   that zebra diet remained constant in winter and summer.  Wildebeest diet
   however, alternated with seasons, showing high preferences during the
   winter months for grass species which were rejected during summer.
   The combined assessment of results from three separate statistical
   methods analysing temporal patterns and preferences in diet composition
   revealed contradictory trends.  The solution, however, relied on the
   initial assumptions posed.  Hence, wildebeest and zebra are essentially
   generalist feeders which show a limited amount of preference in their
   choice of diet.}},

Abstract = {{Climate and weather can substantially influence the development and
   distribution of insects. Anthropogenically induced climatic change
   arising from increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases would,
   therefore, be likely to have a significant effect on agricultural insect
   pests. Current best estimates of changes in climate indicate an increase
   in global mean annual temperatures of 1-degrees-C by 2025 and
   3-degrees-C by the end of the next century. Such increases in
   temperature have a number of implications for temperature-dependent
   insect pests in mid-latitude regions. Changes in climate may result in
   changes in geographical distribution, increased overwintering, changes
   in population growth rates, increases in the number of generations,
   extension of the development season, changes in crop-pest synchrony,
   changes in interspecific interactions and increased risk of invasion by
   migrant pests. To illustrate some of these effects, results of a study
   investigating the impact of climatic change on the European corn borer
   (Ostrinia nubilalis) in Europe are shown. Under the climatic changes
   projected by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies general circulation
   model, northward shifts in the potential distribution of the European
   corn borer of up to 1220 km are estimated to occur, with an additional
   generation found in nearly all regions where it is currently known to
   occur. A number of priorities for future research into the effects of
   climatic changes on agricultural insect pests can be identified. These
   include: examination of the influence of climatic variables on insect
   pests, long-term monitoring of pest population levels and insect
   behaviour, consideration of possible climatic changes in research into
   pest management systems and identification of potential migrants.}},

Abstract = {{1.  The distribution of native and alien crayfish in the British Isles,
   based on records from 1970-1991, is figured at the 10 km square level
   and that for Britain is tabulated regionally.
   2.  Since 1981 crayfish plague has been recorded from six catchments in
   Britain and one in Ireland, and suspected from an additional four
   catchments in Britain; 56.2\% of native crayfish sites in Britain occur
   in catchments from which plague has been confirmed.
   3.  Since the mid-1970s approximately 300 signal crayfish implants have
   been made in Britain.  Only 117 `successful' implants of signals are
   known to the authors; 39 crayfish farmers were registered in 1986 and 68
   by 1990.  In 1989 declared production was approximately 7 tonnes.
   4.  Some mixed populations of natives and disease-free signals exist. 
   Evidence for exclusion of natives is being monitored.
   5.  Signal crayfish are found in the flowing waters of seven catchments;
   58.1\% of native crayfish sites are located in catchments which support
   farmed and wild populations of signals.  Some rapidly-expanding Turkish
   crayfish populations are known, particularly in the Thames catchment.
   6.  At least 87\% of native crayfish records are from good quality
   waters.
   7.  Native populations from 88.6\% of sites recorded in Britain since
   1970 have either been eliminated, or are directly threatened, by
   crayfish plague infection, and/or habitat invasion by signals, and/or
   pollution.
   8.  The native crayfish was added to the list of species protected under
   the Wildlife and Countryside Act in 1986.
   9.  Recommendations to assist in the conservation of the native crayfish
   include a ban on future imports of alien crayfish, a reassessment of
   records, the setting up of `no-go' areas, the protection of isolated
   sites, and a restocking programme.
   10.  There are many restricted, healthy populations of native crayfish
   in areas which could be protected by designating them as Sites of
   Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).}},

Abstract = {{1.  A static life table for Loch Lomond powan, Coregonus lavaretus (L.)
   has been constructed from data obtained during 1980-1988, as a basis for
   monitoring any changes in the population which may ensue from
   exploitation of the Loch.
   2.  Mortality was 99.95\% during the first year of life, and adult
   mortality highest at 5-6 years.
   3.  Average fecundity was 20.7 ova mm-1 fork length.
   4.  Mortality and fecundity have not changed in 25 years.
   5.  It is not yet possible to assess the effect of the recent
   introduction of ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus (L.) into Loch Lomond, but
   their effect on recruitment into the vulnerable 0-1 year-class may be
   critical.}},

Abstract = {{The short-term impacts on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) of low-level jet
   fighter training activity at Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay (Labrador)
   were investigated during the 1986-88 training seasons (April-October). 
   Visual observations of low-level (30 m agl) jet overpasses indicated an
   initial startle response but otherwise brief overt reaction by woodland
   caribou on late-winter alpine tundra habitat.  Between 1986 and 1988,
   daily effects of jet overflights were monitored on 10 caribou equipped
   with satellite-tracked radiocollars, which provided daily indices of
   activity and movement.  Half the animals were exposed to jet
   overflights; the other 5 caribou were avoided during training exercises
   and therefore served as control animals.  In 1988, the control caribou
   were from a population that had never been overflown.  Level of exposure
   to low-level flying within the exposed population did not significantly
   affect daily activity levels or distance travelled, although comparison
   with the unexposed population did suggest potential effects.  The
   results indicate that significant impacts of low-level overflights can
   be minimized through a program of avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{Mean sizes of duck hunters' bags on the opening days of annual waterfowl
   seasons at selected wetlands in southeastern Australia, between 1972 and
   1990, are correlated with an index of the Southern Oscillation (SOI). 
   Simple correlations exist between bag sizes at the various sites, and
   the mean bag size in Victoria shows a positive relationship with that
   obtained at Barrenbox Swamp, New South Wales.  Bag sizes are most
   significantly correlated with monthly SOI some 25-28 months before the
   eventual start of an open season.  Interannual variations in rainfall in
   eastern Australia are generated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation,
   which is monitored by the SOI, and the waterfowl populations respond to
   changing water and wetland availability.  Accepting that annual bag
   sizes represent an index of waterfowl abundance, the regional population
   size may be related to climatic events associated with changes in SOI
   values.  Further consideration of the SOI and indices of waterfowl
   abundance may allow variations in legislative or management options well
   in advance of individual open seasons.}},

Abstract = {{The natural history and reproductive ecology of a presently undescribed
   marsh crab endemic to the Gulf of Mexico were studied in both the
   laboratory and the field. Weekly sampling of populations in coastal
   Louisiana allowed us to determine the periodicity of molting and ovarian
   development, as well as the seasonal variation in egg laying and size of
   individual egg masses. Timing of molt, egg laying, and egg hatching were
   monitored in individual females under simulated tidal cycles in
   laboratory mesocosms. Peak periods of reproductive activity in Louisiana
   coincide with favorable temperatures and elevated primary productivity
   in coastal waters. Size cohort and fecundity differ between these
   periods. Egg-laying, larval release, and molting observed in individual
   females in the laboratory and extrapolated dates of egg-laying and
   larval release for those in field samples exhibit a semilunar influence
   throughout the season. Female receptivity to mating is tied to
   egg-laying. Rate of embryonic development was associated with decreases
   and increases in egg size. Behavior related to larval release is
   described. Adaptive significance in relation to the intertidal marsh
   habitat is discussed.}},

   1990.  Survivorship estimates of adults for the period including the
   storm were within the normal range from previous years.  Juveniles

   By October 1990 adult population density had increased fourfold over
   prehurricane levels, although adults were smaller.  Juvenile numbers
   also appeared to be increasing, but had not yet reached prehurricane
   densities.  The rapid increase in density may have resulted from an
   increase in retreat sites and a decrease in invertebrate predators. 
   Auditory censuses suggested that density changes for other species
   ranged from a 14 percent increase for the relatively common E. hedricki
   to an 83 percent decrease for the relatively rare E. richmondi.}},

Abstract = {{For 8 years beginning in 1983, we monitored breeding activity by spotted
   salamanders, Ambystoma maculatum, in temporary ponds in eastern
   Virginia.  In the spring of 1988, 1989, and 1990, a majority of the
   ponds examined (67.4\%; N = 218) never contained egg masses or
   spermatophores.  During the 8 years the number of egg masses declined
   severely in many ponds that were used as breeding sites.  Ponds with
   breeding salamanders had significantly higher pH values than those that
   lacked breeding activity for all years, but were similar in pH to those
   with failed reproduction.  Analysis of the 20 major cations indicated
   that successful ponds with large numbers of spotted salamander egg
   masses had lower aluminum, copper, and lead levels than ponds with
   declining populations of salamanders.  Silicon levels were significantly
   higher in successful ponds.  Stepwise discriminant function analyses
   indicate that high aluminum, copper, silicon, and zinc concentrations in
   breeding ponds are associated significantly with the decline in
   reproductive activity of spotted salamanders.  The combination of
   elements in ponds maintaining stable or increasing populations of
   breeding spotted salamanders was distinctive; 91.8\% were classified
   correctly as successful or failed ponds by canonical correlation
   analyses.  Proximity of roads was not correlated with the concentration
   of any cation.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal of apterae from their natal plant was monitored for three
   aphid species (Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Brevicoryne brassicac (Linnaeus)
   and Megoura viciae Buckton), each on a different host plant. Some
   movement off the plant occurred even in the initial parental and second
   generations, when the plant appeared to be growing normally and when
   crowding was unlikely to be the cause. However, in most experiments the
   most marked increase in apterous dispersal coincided with a reduction or
   even cessation of plant growth. In nearly all the experiments this
   dispersal occurred when the population on the natal plant exceeded about
   20 adults and their offspring per plant. The main emigrants were fourth
   instar apterae and prelarviposition adult apterae. The implications of
   this behaviour are discussed, and it is argued that apterous dispersal
   might be common in aphids, allowing a fuller utilization of the
   environment than would be likely by alate dispersal alone.}},

Abstract = {{We studied tiger (Panthera tigris) reproduction in Royal Chitwan
   National Park to examine variance in lifetime reproduction and its
   contribution to estimates of inbreeding-effective population size in
   this species.  A total of 36 breeding animals (14 males, 22 females) and
   144 young were monitored between 1973 and 1989.  Mean litter size was
   2.98 and young were born throughout the year.  Mortality during the
   first year was 34\%.  Loss of entire litters accounted for 73\% of
   first-year mortality, suggesting that chance events were more important
   in determining first-year survival than the quality of a female's
   territory.  Second-year mortality was 17\%, and most (71\%) was
   within-litter mortality.  The number of young that survived to dispersal
   or 2 years was used as a measure of lifetime reproduction.  To calculate
   the effect of variance in lifetime reproduction on inbreeding-effective
   population size, we estimated the distribution of number of offspring
   that reach breeding age.  High variance in lifetime reproduction
   resulted in an N(e)-to-N ratio of 0.41 and an N(e) of 26.  Because the
   rate of inbreeding in the Chitwan population is approximately 2\% per
   generation and Chitwan is one of the largest tiger populations on the
   Indian subcontinent, it is possible that inbreeding depression occurs in
   many tiger populations.  Inbreeding depression may be reflected in many
   measures of fitness:  litter size, birth weight, infant and early
   survival, and sperm viability.  The field data presented here
   demonstrate the length of time and effort needed to obtain even a single
   moderate-sized data set.  Were it possible to obtain two such data sets,
   comparisons between populations or time periods would be problematic. 
   Because of these difficulties, conservation decision-makers will need to
   rely on population viability analysis modeling.  Long-term field data on
   individual populations and information on the dynamics of
   metapopulations are needed to build and validate these models.}},

   fell to 25\% of their prerelease levels. Parasitization rates ranged
   from 20 to 99\%. Euplectrus sp. was the most abundant parasitoid. It
   parasitized all instars, but was more common on second and third
   instars. More eggs were laid on older instars of the caterpillar.
   Euplectrus sp. was more abundant in the dry season whereas B. lateralis
   was more common in the wet season. Fruit production on monitored trees
   increased significantly after the parasitoids became effective.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic mutation plays a critical role in carcinogenesis. Numerous
   environmental agents can increase the probability that somatic mutation
   will occur. The use of genotoxicity testing is essential for assessing
   potential human toxicity so that hazards can be prevented. Cytogenetic
   monitoring of human populations exposed to chemicals has proved to be a
   useful tool for detecting the chemical mutagenic effects Cytogenetic
   analysis of human chromosomes in peripheral lymphocytes allows direct
   detection of mutation in somatic cells. Different methods can be used
   for chromosomal analysis (conventional chromosomal analysis, sister
   chromatid exchange, micronucleus frequency detection). Micronucleus
   frequency can be detected either in peripheral blood lymphocytes or in
   exfoliated cells. Different examples of human population studies are
   presented. Several problems that are found in biomonitoring studies are
   discussed. These studies should help us learn about individual exposure
   assessment and biologically relevant doses, leading to quantitative
   assessment of human cancer risks.}},

Abstract = {{The debate over nonhuman primate precursors to human handedness is
   unsettled mainly due to lack of data, particularly on apes.  Handedness
   in wild chimpanzees at the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, has been
   monitored in four tasks.  For the simple unimanual ones, reaching and
   grooming, adults use both hands equally (ambidextrous), while for the
   more complex unimanual wadge-dipping and the complex bimanual
   nut-cracking, adults are highly lateralized.  These results support the
   hypothesis that lateralization increases with the complexity of the
   task.  The lateralization is constant for years for each task but may
   vary in an individual with respect to different tasks.  For
   nut-cracking, females are more lateralized than males.  The ontogeny of
   handedness for nut-cracking shows many variations in the tendency to use
   one hand and in the side preferred, until at about 10 years of age, the
   individual achieves her adult handedness.  No population bias toward one
   side exists in Tai chimpanzees.  No heritability of handedness between
   mother and offspring was observed.  Human and chimpanzees handedness are
   compared.}},

   water per day during most of the 1987 and 1988 growing seasons.  Burning
   bush plants obtained from a nursery arrived in May 1987 infested with
   small populations of twospotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch. 
   All plants were treated with carbaryl to suppress predators.  Spider
   mite populations and leaf abscission were monitored weekly in July and
   August.  Plants tested in 1987 were held over the winter and given the
   same irrigation treatments again in 1988.  Water stress to plants held
   at low irrigation rates in 1987 was manifested as reduced stem diameter
   of new growth in spring 1988.  Burning bush leaf abscission was
   correlated with T. urticae populations in 1987 (r2 = 0.50-0.73) and 1988
   (r2 = 0.15-0.75) but not with irrigation rates (r2 = 0.03-0.09).  In
   1987, mite population growth was similar on plants at all irrigation
   rates.  However, mite populations in 1988 developed more rapidly on
   plants receiving 500 and 800 ml of water per day than on plants
   receiving 1,100 and 1,400 ml of water per day.}},

Abstract = {{Installation of hydroelectric power at Brighton Dam on the Patuxent
   River (near Olney, Maryland) in December 1985 was accompanied by a
   revised (versus pre-operational) flow release schedule intended to
   reduce the amount of time downstream macroinvertebrates were exposed to
   extreme high and low flows and to eliminate rapid changes in flow
   between these extremes. To assess whether the flow regime was effective
   at protecting downstream biota, benthic macroinvertebrate populations
   were monitored for 20 months before and 23 months after the revised flow
   regime was implemented. Changes in invertebrate abundance below the dam
   were tested using an analysis of covariance, employing abundance above
   the dam as a covariate to account for seasonal and among-year variation.
   The revised flow regime resulted in a 35\% reduction in low flows
   (defined as flows less than half the average annual flow) and a 25\%
   reduction in high flows (defined as greater than twice the average
   annual flow). Benthic macroinvertebrates responded to this improvement
   in the flow pattern with a doubling in total density at the downstream
   sites. The altered flow regime also resulted in increased abundance at
   below dam stations for six of the 11 taxa that were analyzed
   individually as well as a higher quality invertebrate community at the
   downstream station nearest the dam (measured by the Hilsenhoff index).
   Careful planning of flow modification associated with hydroelectric
   operations was effective not only at protecting, but also enhancing the
   downstream biota.}},

Abstract = {{In five study areas in the Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, 129 nests of
   alligators were located during 13 nesting seasons. The total predation
   rate on these nests was 69\%; the predation rate of 93\% in one study
   area is the highest ever reported for an alligator population. Predation
   on nests was significantly higher during nesting periods with low water
   levels. The nest defense strategies of alligators were investigated
   using log-linear analysis; nests guarded from humans had a significantly
   lower predation rate than either attended or unattended nests.
   Surveillance cameras monitored turtles, Pseudemys nelsoni, using
   alligator nests as oviposition sites. These cameras also identified
   bears, Ursus americanus, as the primary predator of alligator eggs.}},

Abstract = {{The polluting effects of fish farming have been well-documented, but the
   scale of the problem and the difficulty in effectively controlling the
   industry are less well known.  In approximately twenty years, production
   by this industry in Scotland has increased by two orders of magnitude
   and it has been estimated that the population equivalent of fish farming
   effluents is as high as 1.5 million.
   The development of a pollution control policy for both land-based and
   floating-cage farms is described.  The role of other controlling
   agencies is discussed and legislative weaknesses are identified.  In
   addition, the industry's reaction to pollution control is highlighted.
   Polluting discharges are not controlled only through the issuing of
   consents, but effective monitoring is also required.  Resource
   constraints resulted in a policy which includes the requirement of
   certain fish farmers to self-monitor their activities.}},

Abstract = {{The dasyurid marsupial Antechinus stuartii (20-40 g) has a brief, highly
   synchronized mating period in spring followed by complete male
   mortality. Analysis of breeding times in nature suggests that the rate
   of change of photoperiod is the main Zeitgeber for reproductive timing
   in this species. To test this hypothesis the natural photoperiod was
   phase delayed by two months, one experiment beginning in late summer,
   and the other in the autumn, before the spring breeding period.
   The reproductive cycle of males and females exposed to the delay in
   summer was synchronously delayed by two months, coincident with the
   exact duration of the delay. Animals exposed to the two month phase
   delay in autumn also exhibited a delay in reproductive timing, but it
   was less synchronized than either the control or the other experimental
   group. Reproduction in control animals exposed to natural photoperiod
   was synchronous with that of a wild population monitored simultaneously.
   It is therefore likely that the rate of change of photoperiod is the
   dominant Zeitgeber for the reproductive cycle in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Natural plankton populations from subarctic Pacific surface waters were
   incubated in 7-d experiments with added concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu,
   and Zn. Small additions of metals (0.89 nM Fe, 1.8 nM Mn, 3.9 nM Cu, and
   0.75 nM Zn) were used to simulate natural perturbations in metal
   concentrations potentially experienced by marine plankton. Trace metal
   concentrations, phytoplankton productivity, Chl a, and the species
   composition of phytoplankton and microzooplankton were measured over the
   course of the experiment. Although the controls indicated little growth,
   increases in phytoplankton productivity, Chl a, and cell densities were
   dramatic after the addition of 0.89 nM Fe, indicating that it may limit
   the rates of algal production in these waters. Similar increases were
   observed in experiments with 3.9 nM Cu added. The Cu effect is
   attributed to a decrease in the grazing activities of the
   microzooplankton (ciliates) and increases in the rates of production. Mn
   enrichment had its greatest effect on diatom biomass, whereas Zn
   enrichment had its greatest effect on other autofluorescent organisms.
   The extent of trace metal adsorption onto carboy walls was also
   evaluated. These results imply that natural systems may be affected as
   follows: natural levels of Fe and Cu may influence phytoplankton
   productivity and trophic structure in open-ocean, high-nutrient,
   low-biomass systems; rates of net production are not limited by one
   micronutrient alone. Because of the effects of adsorption and
   complexation, experiments must be carefully monitored for free vs. total
   metal concentrations, and short-term incubations (1 d) may not be
   affected dramatically by small perturbations in trace metal
   micronutrients.}},

Abstract = {{Various phenomena related to reproduction and recruitment in a
   population of Fucus distichus L. emend. Powell in Vancouver, British
   Columbia, Canada were evaluated. Using log linear analysis and tests for
   simple, multiple and partial associations, age and size were both found
   to be significant, but size slightly more so than age, as descriptors of
   reproductive events. Reproductive plants were found throughout the
   sampling period, from September 1985 to November 1987, but peaked in
   fall and winter of each year. Potential egg production, based on number
   of eggs produced per conceptacle and number of conceptacles per unit
   area of receptacle, is size-dependent. However, estimated monthly egg
   production, calculated by observed number of eggs in clusters extruded
   from the receptacle, is independent Of plant size. Two types of recruits
   were monitored. Microrecruits (< 1 mo-old of microscopic size) are
   germlings developed from fertilized eggs. Their numbers were assessed
   using settling blocks, Macrorecruits are detectable by the unaided eve
   and are plants appearing in the permanent quadrats for the first time,
   They can first be detected when about 3 to 4 mo old. The recruitment
   pattern of microrecruits is significantly correlated with reproductive
   phenology and patterns of potential and estimated monthly egg
   production. The pattern of recruitment of macrorecruits is negatively
   correlated with reproductive phenology and that of the estimated monthly
   egg production. Peaks in microrecruitment are not always followed by
   peaks in macro-recruitment. This apparent discrepancy is probably due to
   a differential survivorship of microrecruits over time or to the
   possible existence of a `germling bank'. Patterns of survival and
   emergence of macrorecruits may be independent of those of microrecruits
   or may be unrelated to the prevailing reproductive phenology.}},

Abstract = {{Hurricane Hugo (1989) severely damaged the framebuilding coral
   Montastrea annularis on the shallow reefs in Greater Lameshur Bay, St.
   John. Before the storm these reefs were dominated by M. annularis and a
   permanent study area was established at 10 m depth to monitor changes in
   abundance of this species. The storm destroyed, on average, > 33\% of
   the live cover of M. annularis in the study area. Post-hurricane reefs
   contained numerous detached colonies in piles or packed into cavities
   within the reef framework, large areas of vacant hard substratum and
   extensive growths of the red algae Liagora spp. Video transects (80 m2)
   at the same depth and on either side of the study area showed that this
   damage was patchy. Although these reefs may remain dominated by M.
   annularis it is possible that the scleractinian fauna will change as a
   result of colonization by other coral species and delayed mortality of
   detached M. annularis colonies.}},

Abstract = {{In order to clarify the encystment conditions for the red tide
   flagellate. Chattonella antiqua, cyst yield in batch cultures under a
   variety of environmental treatments and cyst flux in natural populations
   were monitored. In laboratory culture experiments, attempts were made to
   form `small cells' (gametes) and cysts under nutrient-replete
   conditions, but they could not be formed without N- or P-depletion. Once
   small cells were formed by nutrient depletion, encystment was affected
   by environmental conditions. Cyst production was highest under
   continuous darkness and decreased with increasing light intensity. The
   optimum temperature range for encystment was 21.6 to
   greater-than-or-equal-to 26.6-degrees-C, broader than that for maximum
   growth rate. Cyst production increased linearly with increase in motile
   cell concentration, indicating that the efficiency of encystment was
   independent of motile cell concentration. Re-addition of nutrients to N-
   or P-depleted cultures did not affect cyst production. In the field,
   cyst flux of Chattonella spp. together with environmental variables were
   monitored throughout the blooming period of C. antiqua in the Scto
   Inland Sea, Japan. Cysts were formed mainly below a depth of 15 m when
   nutrients were exhausted in the C. antiqua habitat (0 to 10 m) and the
   population was decreasing. Based on laboratory culture experiments and
   field observations, a simple model for encystment in the field was
   proposed. Following the development of the bloom, nutrients in the
   habitat of C. antiqua were exhausted and small cells were formed due to
   N- or P-depletion. Since small cells have a tendency to sink, they
   descended to the lower layer (> 15 m) where environmental conditions
   were more favorable for encystment than in the upper layer (i.e. lower
   irradiance, optimal temperature, and replete nutrients do not affect
   encystment), and cysts were formed through the fusion of small cells
   below 15 m. However, the possibility that small cells are formed without
   nutrient depletion cannot be completely ruled out, so the above model is
   not conclusive.}},

Abstract = {{Many methods have been used to survey red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and gray
   fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) populations. However, none has proven
   entirely satisfactory, and wild foxes remain one of the most difficult
   economically important wildlife species to monitor. In this study we
   evaluated the reliability of a snow track survey method for foxes by
   investigating whether the average number of road crossings per fox is
   influenced by changes in roadside habitat or changes in fox density.
   Several snow track surveys were conducted in two Ohio counties during
   January and February, 1984. Data on roadside habitat, relative fox
   densities, and fox crossings were collected. Results suggested that
   changes in roadside habitat could influence the average number of
   crossings per fox and, therefore, changes in the index could occur
   independent of actual population changes. We found no evidence that
   crossings per fox varied with fox density, but further research is
   needed to substantiate this finding.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of breeding territoriality on the stability of grey
   red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus bedfordiae) populations were
   investigated on a control grid and a grid on which the voles were fed,
   in an outdoor enclosure in Hokkaido, Japan. Vole populations were
   monitored by live trapping from 1984 to 1986: (1) Population density was
   2-7 times greater on the experimental grid to which food was added than
   on the control grid. Reproductive output was more closely associated
   with the difference in density between grids than survival or dispersal
   (immigration and emigration) rates. (2) The number of adult females and
   pregnancy rate of the experimental population were significantly greater
   than those of the control one. The difference in the number of adult
   females between the populations was greater than that in pregnancy rate.
   (3) The proportion of successful litters and the number of weanlings per
   litter were not significantly different between the control and
   experimental population. (4) Adult females held territories on both the
   control and experimental grid; they were spaced out more than would be
   expected from random occupation. The territories overlapped more on the
   experimental grid than on the control grid. (5) Mean territory size of
   adult females on the experimental grid was about half of that on the
   control grid. The territory size was correlated negatively with
   population density. (6) The proportion of trap sites that were used by
   adult females was significantly greater on the experimental grid than on
   the control grid. This suggests that adult females on the experimental
   grid used the area more extensively. This factor, in association with
   territory size and overlapping of territory, was also important in
   causing the difference in the number of adult females between the grids.
   (7) These results call into question the hypothesis that territoriality
   stabilizes the density in populations of Clethrionomys.}},

Abstract = {{Following a wildfire which caused patchy damage to a Stylosanthes spp.
   pasture in north Queensland, anthracnose development was monitored in
   the subsequent plant generation in unburned, partially burned and
   completely burned areas. The disease, caused by Colletotrichum
   gloeosporioides, appeared within four days after seedling emergence in
   unburned areas but not until after 14 days in both burned treatments,
   indicating that seedborne inocula did not establish an anthracnose
   epidemic. Although disease incidence increased rapidly in the unburned
   areas and had affected 70\% of the plant population in the first 14
   days, at the conclusion of the experiment (52 days after commencement)
   only 6.6\% of the population in the completely burned area showed
   symptoms. There was no difference in anthracnose development between the
   two burning treatments. Laboratory isolations indicated that the fungus
   was unable to survive in sub-epidermal lesions remaining in plant debris
   exposed to the fire, and trap plants exposed daily during rainfall
   indicated very little inoculum was present in these areas. The bulk of
   the inoculum appeared to be that of a single, simple race of C.
   gloeosporioides. Provided other effects are considered, managing
   anthracnose in Stylosanthes spp. pastures and seed crops by fire is
   worthy of consideration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, three perspectives for indoor air issues are considered: 
   a) air inside of our homes and offices is a major component of our
   overall living environment and has potentially great impact on public
   health; b) there are important scientific questions raised specifically
   to indoor air that will require skills and expertise to develop and
   interpret research and data collection efforts; and c) from a risk
   assessor's point of view, the types and quality of scientific
   information is critical to the process of health risk assessment to risk
   managers to make the best decisions regarding environmental risks from
   indoor air.  The primary focus of this presentation is to highlight
   suggested future directions and needs of the U.S.  Environmental
   Protection Agency that formed the core of a report to Congress on
   assessment and control of indoor air pollution.  The five major areas
   that constitute the current EPA indoor air research strategy are
   monitoring/building studies; health effects; source
   characterization/mitigation; health impact/risk assessment; and program
   management/technology transfer.  Additionally, major trends and research
   needs are discussed, including greater emphasis on noncancer effects and
   multiple pollutants at low levels and the need for more sensitive
   measures for detecting adverse health effects to more effectively
   characterize chemically sensitive individuals and population subgroups.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored male natal dispersal and space use in three experimental
   populations of Clethrionomys rufocanus with known kinship. Only 10\% of
   the males that were recruited to these populations settled close to
   their natal site as reproductive adults. The presence of close relatives
   (mothers and siblings) had no influence on the propensity for dispersal
   in young males. Home range overlap with mothers and other males
   decreased with dispersal distance. However, in general, the degree of
   space sharing with other reproductive animals was not affected by
   kinship. We conclude from our analysis of space use and natal dispersal
   that kin-recognition mechanisms do not seem to play any role in
   structuring free-ranging populations of C. rufocanus. We suggest that
   heavily male-biased dispersal, predominant female territoriality and a
   promiscuous mating system are sufficient factors to prevent inbreeding
   and kin-selection.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data describing microbially mediated transport and
   transformation processes for two pesticides are presented.  A mixed
   culture of microorganisms maintained in a minimal basal salts media
   supplemented with a single, low energy carbon source provided inoculum
   for a series of small, aerobic batch reactors containing varying
   concentrations of either lindane or 2,4-D.  Controls were simultaneously
   established to monitor microbial performance without pesticides as well
   as any non-biological pesticide removals.  Data were collected daily
   enumerating pesticide and primary substrate removal, bacterial numbers,
   pH and dissolved oxygen.  Rate constants, assumed to be first order in
   form were calculated for pertinent substrate and microbial population
   properties.  Lindane removal initially consisted of
   adsorption-desorption from the microbial biomass followed by
   decomposition, which began as the primary substrate concentration
   decreased to detection levels.  2,4-D removal did not include
   significant adsorption and proceeded with the removal of the primary
   substrate.  Complex interactions exist between low energy, non-toxic
   primary substrates, high energy-increasingly toxic secondary materials,
   and the microbial populations involved in transport and transformation
   of the pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae), plots were established in
   1988 and 1989 with an alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. (Fabaceae), strip at
   one edge to determine whether alfalfa could serve as a source of the
   western predatory mite, Metaseiulus (= Typhlodromus = Galandromus)
   occidentalis Nesbitt (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Western predatory mites were
   released into the alfalfa early in the season. Spider mite (Acari:
   Tetranychidae) and western predatory mite density was monitored in
   alfalfa and in cotton at varying distances from alfalfa. Western
   predatory mite successfully established populations in alfalfa in both
   1988 and 1989. Western predatory mite density was significantly higher
   close to alfalfa early in the season, indicating that alfalfa was the
   source. Average seasonal spider mite density was significantly lower
   close to the alfalfa. Spider mites were effectively controlled and
   cotton yield was higher adjacent to alfalfa in 1989 but not in 1988. Our
   results indicate that there is potential in the use of alfalfa as a
   nursery crop for enhancing western predatory mites in agricultural
   systems. (C) 1991 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A computer simulation model was developed to investigate spatial and
   population dynamics of apterous Russian wheat aphids (Diuraphis noxia)
   on preferred (wheat) and non-preferred (oat) hosts. The location,
   development, reproduction, movement, and mortality of individual aphids
   within a population were predicted at simulated one-day time steps.
   Reproductive rate and mortality were modeled as stochastic processes,
   which were functions of both aphid chronological age and host
   favorability. An index of host favorability was established for each
   plant in a 25 x 25-plant grid containing wheat or oats. Host
   favorability was dependent on host species and aphid density on that
   plant. Aphid movement was modeled as a stochastic process, with
   probability of movement dependent on insect age and host plant
   favorability. The distance moved was proportional to the density of
   aphids on the plant the aphid was leaving, with random direction of
   movement. The model was calibrated with data from experiments in which
   Stephens wheat or Border oat plants in growth chambers were infested
   with adult female aphids, and populations monitored after 0, 3, and 7
   days. Ability of the model to predict observed populations and plant
   infestation after 14 and 21 days was then tested. Use of the model to
   generate predicted spatial patterns of aphids on differential hosts is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We studied population responses to variation in larval density in a
   salamander (Ambystoma laterale) that breeds in splash pools on exposed
   rocky shorelines at Isle Royale, Michigan. Population densities and size
   distributions were sampled in the field with little error because the
   water is clear and the pools are kept free of sediment and vegetation by
   waves from winter storms on Lake Superior. We experimentally manipulated
   salamander densities in 12 natural pools (three replicates each of four
   densities) and simultaneously monitored salamander populations in 27
   control pools on two islands. The experiment demonstrated that
   increasing density significantly reduced survival and growth, and
   increased the skew in the size distributions of individuals. Each of
   these responses was also observed in the undisturbed natural
   populations. Density effects were probably due to interference because
   (1) natural variation in the densities of prey taxa did not influence
   salamander performance in the experiment, (2) salamander density had no
   effect on prey availability, and (3) tail damage from attacks by
   conspecifics was widespread and positively correlated with density. We
   conclude that density dependence is commonplace in salamander larvae,
   and probably makes an important contribution to regulating the
   population size of Ambystoma laterale at Isle Royale.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the relative importance of asexual and sexual
   reproduction to the fitness of a clonal organism, matrix projection
   models were used to quantify the contributions of each of these
   reproductive modes to population growth of the soft coral, Alcyonium
   sp., a species that undergoes frequent colony fission. The demographic
   and fitness consequences of eliminating either asexual or sexual
   reproduction from the life cycle of this species were examined by
   sensitivity analysis and by altering selected entries in the transition
   matrices to simulate changes in reproductive allocation.
   Four populations of Alcyonium sp. were monitored photographically for
   two years to record colony growth, mortality, fission, sexual
   reproduction, and larval recruitment. Despite high turnover, population
   densities remained reasonably constant. The 24-52\% mortality was
   matched approximately by recruitment of daughter colonies produced by
   fission. Sexual reproduction was infrequent, and no larval recruitment
   was observed. The frequency of both fission and sexual reproduction
   increased with increasing colony size, while mortality decreased with
   increasing size.
   Size-class transition matrices constructed from the demographic data
   were analyzed by the methods of Caswell (1986, 1989). In both years of
   the study the size distributions of colonies observed in the field did
   not differ from the stable size distributions predicted from the
   projection models. Eliminating sexual reproduction from the life cycle
   did not alter the predicted stable size distributions; eliminating
   fission shifted the size distributions of all four populations towards
   the larger size classes. Reproductive value increased with increasing
   colony size. Damping ratio, rho, a measure of the rate of convergence to
   the stable size distribution, increased with increases in both fission
   and sexual reproduction, suggesting that rapidly growing populations are
   more stable than slowly growing populations.
   Projected growth rates (= relative fitness, lambda) of the four
   populations ranged from 0.66 to 1.15. Sensitivity analyses indicated
   that sexual reproduction contributes < 1\% of the value of lambda, while
   > 40\% of lambda is accounted for by transitions between the upper size
   classes in the population, either by fission or growth. Eliminating
   sexual reproduction from the life cycle had a negligible effect on
   fitness (lambda); eliminating fission greatly reduced-lambda and
   suggested rapid extinction for all populations. This result held even
   when sexual reproductive output was increased by an order of magnitude.
   The results of these simulations suggest that selection for
   increased-lambda will increase fission at the expense of sexual
   reproduction in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and distribution of settlers, recruits, and adults of the
   barnacle Semibalanus balanoides were monitored in the high, mid, and low
   intertidal zones at two adjacent, but physically and biologically
   different sites (A and B) on a rocky intertidal shore in Nova Scotia
   following a rare occurrence of ice scouring. Availability of planktonic
   cyprid larvae also was measured at site A. There was a strong
   concordance between cyprid availability and settler density over the
   main settlement period among intertidal heights, where each was
   inversely related to intertidal height. Differences in cyprid
   availability with intertidal height were related to immersion time as
   the larvae, in general, were uniformly distributed at the
   water-substratum interface. Settlement rate was strongly correlated with
   cyprid availability in the low intertidal zone al site A, where most
   settlement occurred. In all zones at both sites, recruit density at the
   end of the main settlement period was a positive function of settler
   density over this period: on average, 79\% of the variation in recruit
   density was explained by settler density over the main settlement
   period. Adult density and total settler density also tended to be
   strongly related: 86\% (mid zone at site A) and 73\% (high zone at site
   B) of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler
   density, except where postrecruitment mortality (i.e., predation) was
   high (e.g., only 1\% of the variation in adult density was explained by
   total settler density in the low zone at site A). Local hydrodynamics,
   which influences supply and distribution of planktonic larvae, may
   dictate the distribution of settlers and, ultimately, adults on this
   shore.}},

Abstract = {{A field cage was used to study sex pheromone mediated behavior and
   evaluate female-baited pheromone traps for capture of males of the
   pickleworm, Diaphania nitidalis (Stoll).  Males were attracted to
   females throughout scotophase with peak attraction occurring during the
   third (2200-2259 hours), fourth (2300-2359 hours), and fifth (0000-0059
   hours) hours.  Four traps were evaluated:  (1) the box, currently used
   for monitoring pickleworm moth populations; (2) the Heliothis; (3) the
   Pherocon 1C (sticky); and (4) the unitrap (bucket).  The bucket trap
   consistently captured and retained more male pickleworm moths than the
   other traps tested.  The bucket trap was evaluated at 30, 80, 150, and
   180 cm above ground level.  Significantly more males were caught at 80
   and 150 cm than at either extreme.  Trap efficiency was determined for
   the bucket trap and a modified (Fluon-coated outer cone) bucket trap. 
   Efficiencies for the bucket and modified bucket traps were not
   significantly different.  The bucket trap caught 20.3 +/- 1.2\% (xBAR
   +/- SEM) of males orienting toward the trap, 29.3 +/- 1.7\% of males
   touching the trap, and 41.0 +/- 3.3\% of males landing on the caged
   females used as the pheromone source.}},

Abstract = {{The fishery for Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters) in Victoria reservoir
   was studied by monitoring the monthly catch for 18 months. The reservoir
   is situated 483 m above m.s.l. and has a surface area and a mean depth
   of 2370 ha and 31 m, respectively. The annual fish production of the
   reservoir was 70.13 kg ha-1. The main fishing gear was 9-15 cm
   stretched-mesh gillnets. Oreochromis mossambicus constituted 42.5\% of
   the catch.
   Growth parameters of O. mossambicus, as estimated from the monthly
   size-frequency data, were L infinity = 39.3 cm total length and K =
   0.48. It takes about 8 years to reach the asymptotic length, but the
   observed minimum and maximum lengths of 15.1 cm and 37.8 cm,
   respectively, would be reached in about 12 and 67 months. Ninety percent
   of the O. mossambicus catch were in the size range of 19.0-28.5 cm
   (131-439 g) and were second or third year fish.
   The mean growth rate, asymptotic length, and the growth performance
   index-phi of 2.60, of the population, as well as the exploitation rate
   of the fishery of 0.645, compare favourably with those of other
   populations and fisheries of O. mossambicus in the lowland irrigation
   reservoirs of Sri Lanka.
   The spawning of O. mossambicus in Victoria reservoir takes place
   throughout the year but appears to be enhanced during periods in which
   the water level fluctuations are relatively small.}},

Abstract = {{Porapak Q-captured voltiles of male Polygraphus rufipennis (Kirby)
   boring in black spruce and white spruce from Newfoundland and British
   Columbia, respectively, contained 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol.  Volatiles from
   logs in which the males had been joined by females contained the
   compound in reduced quantities.  Hindgut extracts from male and female
   P. rufipennis disclosed no male-specific volatiles, but
   3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol was detected in extracts of male-produced frass. 
   The compound was not present in extracts from fresh pholoem tissue.  P.
   rufipennis of both sexes responded strongly in the field to traps baited
   with 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol released at 4390-mu-g/day.  There was little
   response to unbaited traps, fresh uninfested black spruce logs, or to
   3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol released at lower rates.  Combination of
   3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol with either one of five terpenes prevalent in
   black spruce did not enhance beetle catch.  Approximately half of 20
   black spruce trees baited with 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol were attacked,
   compared to 20.0\% of 10 unbaited control trees.  This new aggregation
   pheromone could be used to monitor or manage P. rufipennis populations.}},

Abstract = {{Oriental fruit fly, Dacus dorsalis Hendel, captures were higher on
   yellow and white than on orange, red, light green, dark green, blue, and
   black spheres hung in guava (Psidium guajava L.) trees.  Captures were
   greater on 4-cm than on 2-cm yellow spheres.  During a series of four
   1-wk study periods, mean numbers of D. dorsalis captured on yellow and
   white spheres were 4.4 and 6.3 flies per sphere, respectively.  Four
   species of D. dorsalis parasitoids were also captured on 4-cm yellow and
   white spheres:  Biosteres arisanus (Sonan), Psyttalia incisi
   (Silvestri), Biosteres vandenboschi (Fullaway), and Diachasmimorpha
   longicaudata (Ashmead).  These species constituted 84.1, 5.3, 5.3, and
   5.3\%, respectively, of the total braconid parasitoids captured on
   yellow spheres and 83.3, 10.5, 3.1, and 3.1\%, respectively, of the
   total parasitoids captured on white spheres.  Mean numbers of B.
   arisanus, the most abundant opiine parasitoid, were 1.6 wasps per yellow
   sphere and 0.8 wasp per white sphere.  This research indicates yellow or
   white spheres would be useful devices for monitoring D. dorsalis and

Abstract = {{When populations of adult sheep ked, Melophagus ovinus (L.), infesting
   unshorn lambs were monitored at the University of Wyoming Paradise Farm
   during 1986, we determined the body regions on which keds would be found
   at various times of the year and their seasonal population trends for
   optimal sampling.  Results suggested that ked populations were
   consistently greater on the ribs than on any other area of the lamb.  No
   significant differences were detected for ked populations between sides
   of a lamb.  Distinct and similar ked population trends over time
   occurred only in the rib, thigh, shoulder, hind leg, belly, and hind
   flank areas of the lambs, suggesting that a significant seasonal
   migration did not occur.  Analyses for seasonal population fluctuations
   indicated indicated that ked populations increased in the winter and
   spring, decreased in summer and then increased again in the fall.  Thus,
   sampling for keds in the rib area at shearing, which begins in March in
   Wyoming and runs through mid-April, would be an opportune time to detect
   keds.  At other times of the year, the rib area should be inspected for
   presence of sheep ked.}},

Abstract = {{An automated acoustical detection system for monitoring Tribolium
   castaneum (Herbst) populations in stored wheat was evaluated using 16
   microphones per 5 bu (176.2 liters) wheat.  A regression equation
   explained 93.9\% of the variation in the number of insect sounds over a
   range of 5-640 adult insects per 5 bu.  For one microphone during a 10-s
   interval, the probability of detection increased rapidly from
   almost-equal-to 0.12 with 10 insects per 5 bu to 0.44 with 80 insects
   per 5 bu, and then more slowly to 0.66 with 640 insects per 5 bu.  The
   probability of detection was almost-equal-to 0.90 with 40 insects per 5
   bu and 3 microphones, 20 insects per 5 bu and 4 microphones, 10 insects
   per 5 bu and 5 microphones, or 5 insects per 5 bu and 12 microphones. 
   More frequently monitoring a single microphone improved the probability
   of detection 60-80\% as much as adding the same number of microphones. 
   The number of insect sounds was unaffected by the sex or mating status
   of the insects and decreased logarithmically with increasing distance
   between insect and microphone.  Adults produced 80 times more sounds
   than larvae.  Automation of insect monitoring should increase
   reliability and reduce labor costs.}},

   characterized.  Regions contained one to four sampling sites and yielded
   186 isolates.  Additionally, 19 isolates from an ongoing
   metalaxyl-resistance monitoring project were characterized.  In total,
   205 isolates were characterized in terms of allozymes (glucose phosphate
   isomerase {[}Gpi-1] and peptidase {[}Pep-1]), mating type, and metalaxyl
   resistance.  The analysis revealed 17 different genotypes.  Samples from
   some sites were highly heterogeneous, whereas samples from other sites
   appeared homogeneous.  Three genotypes each were detected in five of the
   six regions and together accounted for 61\% of all isolates. 
   Metalaxyl-resistant isolates accounted for 35\% of the total sample and
   45\% of the samples from commercial fields.  Chi-square contingency
   analysis indicated significant differences in genotype frequencies among
   subpopulations from different regions of the country, between A1 and A2
   individuals, and between potato and tomato isolates.  In most locations
   the frequency of allozyme alleles differed significantly from
   frequencies expected according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  The
   results were consistent with asexual reproduction, although the
   occurrence of a low level of sexual reproduction cannot be excluded.}},

Abstract = {{A western blot method was evaluated and compared to the commonly used
   direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT) for rapid detection of
   Renibacterium salmoninarum in tissues from field samples of Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar L.).  The drop-plate culture technique (DPCT) was
   used to confirm the presence of cultivatable R. salmoninarum cells in
   tissues examined by western blot and DFAT.  Tissue homogenates were from
   kidney, spleen, liver and intestine, removed from a random fish sample
   obtained in the spring from a cultured population experiencing a
   bacterial kidney disease (BKD) infection.  Kidney tissue provided the
   highest probability of detecting R. salmoninarum by all three methods. 
   Detection of the major 57 kDa R. salmoninarum soluble antigen (SA) by
   western blot was significantly more sensitive and reliable than
   detection of R. salmoninarum cell-like fluorescent-positive objects (fpo
   s) by the DFAT in tissue homogenates from actively infected fish.  The
   western blot results correlated well with those of the DPCT.  However,
   DPCT results demonstrated that a significant number of false negative
   reactions were generated by the DFAT (approximately 40 to 50\%) which
   were not consistently correlated with low numbers of colony-forming
   units (cfu's) g-1 of kidney tissue.  The status of surviving fish was
   examined the following winter and indicated that the fish had recovered
   from the infection.  All tissues from sampled fish were negative for R.
   salmoninarum by western blot and the DPCT.  However, kidney tissue from
   2 of 20 fish sampled contained fpo's by the DFAT indicating a potential
   presence of dead (or at least inactive) bacteria remaining in the
   tissues of some of the fish.  In the absence of any apparent active
   infection, a modified western blot procedure was used to detect
   seropositive fish which indicated that at least one third of the serum
   samples from surviving fish contained immunoglobulin reacting moderately
   to strongly with R. salmoninarum SA's.  These results are discussed in
   terms of the potential use of rapid western blot methods as alternatives
   to the equivocal FAT methods for monitoring the BKD status of cultured
   fish populations from the field.}},

Abstract = {{The fitness of white-footed mice living in nest boxes was monitored in
   patches of forest, edge, and fence-row habitat to test theories of
   habitat selection. Reproductive success was significantly greater in the
   forest than in the other two habitats, a result that supports theories
   based on exclusive access to resources. The frequency distributions of
   litter production and recruitment success within habitats were not
   significantly different from random expectation. All litters produced in
   a particular habitat had equal chances of success, regardless of which
   box they were born in. Small-scale patches within habitats appear not to
   differ in the fitness achieved by individual colonists. The pattern of
   habitat use was inconsistent with the selection of individual breeding
   sites that maximize reproductive success. Site selection appears to be
   modified by processes acting at larger spatial scales. This
   interpretation is in agreement with census data that demonstrate the
   role of spatial scale as a predictor of density in these and other small
   mammals.}},

Abstract = {{1. This paper reviews the status of the freshwater pearl mussel
   (Margaritifera margaritifera L.) in the British Isles and Continental
   Europe.
   2. The mussel has continued to decline in recent decades throughout the
   European range, apparently caused mainly by pollution (especially by
   organic enrichment) and, in the British Isles, by a combination of this
   and overfishing for pearls.
   3. Of particular concern is the almost complete absence of juveniles in
   most populations, with these occurring in numbers only in a very few
   rivers in remote locations.
   4. M. margaritifera is now completely protected in most European
   countries and in Britain the government has recently made it an offence
   to kill or harm the mussel. However, it will still be permitted to take
   the mussel, examine it carefully for pearls, and then to return it
   unharmed to the river. This may prove difficult to enforce and it is
   concluded that it will be ineffective and that complete protection may
   still be needed.
   5. There is no current monitoring programme for M. margaritifera
   anywhere in its range and without continuing evidence on its status and
   further research on the habitat requirements of the juveniles, it is
   difficult to be optimistic about its survival.}},

   concurrently with exceedance frequencies for all TSP cutoffs, except the
   lowest, and these increased risks were highly statistically significant.
   An increased risk of respiratory cancers was associated with only one

Abstract = {{Historical and archaeological records suggest that muskoxen (Ovibos
   moschatus) were once abundant on Banks Island. They declined around the
   turn of the 20th century and remained at very low population levels
   until the 1970s. The causes of the scarcity of muskoxen are unknown, but
   severe freezing rains and subsequent forage unavailability likely played
   a role. Aerial surveys documented an increase in the estimated
   population size from 3800 in 1972 to 34 225 in 1989. The rapid increase
   in muskox numbers has been a source of concern to the local users, who
   view the muskoxen as detrimental to the caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   pearyi), which have declined in number. Since the mid-1980s,
   productivity of 3-year-old muskox cows and calf survival have decreased
   and the prevalence of parasites has increased. Our data do not allow us
   to distinguish between whether those changes are density-dependent
   population responses or the effects of the severity of winter weather.
   Current management focuses on monitoring the trend of population size,
   the condition and reproduction of the muskoxen.}},

Abstract = {{Intra- and inter-plant spatial patterns were determined for adult and
   immature western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande),
   on greenhouse sweet pepper at two commercial greenhouses using five
   sampling methods. The population density of the thrips was monitored
   biweekly for 4 months from May to August using blue sticky-traps, plant
   tappings, blossoms, plant leaves, and whole plants. The intra-plant
   spatial patterns of adult and immature populations of F. occidentalis
   were aggregated with the majority of the thrips collected from the top
   one-third of the plant. The inter-plant spatial patterns also were
   aggregated. The aggregation cluster for the adult thrips was at least
   three plants in size, although it was surmised to be at the individual
   plant level for immature F. occidentalis. The accuracy of the blue
   sticky-trap, plant tapping, blossom, and leaf samples was determined for
   monitoring the population densities of adult and immature thrips
   throughout the growing season. It was shown that leaves should be
   sampled from the middle section of the sweet pepper plant when using
   this sampling method. A precision-level sampling program was proposed
   for monitoring adult F. occidentalis on greenhouse sweet pepper.
   Sampling blossoms was the most cost-effective sampling method based upon
   time and number of samples for a specific precision level.}},

Abstract = {{Ebenus armitagei Schweiuf. et Taub(Leguminosae) is a perennial woody
   species endemic to the western Mediterranean coast of Egypt and Libya. 
   The species is very rare and restricted to a narrow range of
   distribution.  Growth, phenology, seed output, and predation by the
   bruchid beetle Callosobruchus maculatus F. (Bruchidae-Coleoptera) of a
   naturally growing population were monitored.  Growth and phenology are
   highly seasonal and correlated with precipitation and temperature.  Up
   to 48.4\% of the population is in the juvenile stages, which experience
   high mortality.  Seed predation is extraordinarily heavy.  An average of
   94.4\% of seeds in different stages of maturity are consumed or damaged
   by C. maculatus.  Habitat change and biotic factors within populations
   including seed predation are threatening the species' existence in the
   wild.
   The following are some possible measures for conservation of E.
   armitagei:  (1) small-scale habitat conservation (sanctuary), (2)
   establishment of new populations by artificial means, (3) establishment
   of a gene (seed) bank, (4) encouraging botanical gardens to conserve the
   species, and (5) field application of selective insecticides to control
   the seed predators but not to destroy beneficial insects.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot successfully controlled
   Tetranychus urticae Koch on rose hedges in an integrated mite control
   programme in two unheated plastic-covered tunnels at Cleveland in
   southern Queensland.  Mite populations were monitored fortnightly for
   nearly three years in one tunnel and for two years in a second.  Once
   established, P. persimilis quickly suppressed T. urticae and then
   persisted.  A relatively stable, long-term, low-level interaction
   developed between the two species under normal commercial conditions. 
   In one tunnel, the production (upper) level of the four rose hedges
   contained fewer mites of both species per compound leaf (1.71 of all
   stages of T. urticae, 0.38 motiles; 0.25 of all stages of P. persimilis,
   0.12 motiles) than the maintenance (lower) layer (2.02 of all stages of
   T. urticae, 0.75 motiles; 0.35 of all stages of P. persimilis, 0.21
   motiles).  On 68\% of sampling occasions, 10\% or less of compound
   leaves in the production layer were infested with T. urticae (all stages
   including eggs) and control was excellent throughout the 30-month period
   after P. persimilis was established, there being no economic losses.  In
   the second tunnel, there was no significant difference between mite
   numbers in the production and maintenance layers of the two hedges
   examined.  The overall mean number of all stages of T. urticae per
   compound leaf was 3.2 (1.45 motiles), and of P. persimilis 0.46 (0.25
   motiles).  Control here was slightly less effective than in the first
   tunnel, but was still satisfactory, with 10\% or less of leaves being
   infested on 45.5\% of sampling occasions (20\% or less on 66\% of
   sampling occasions) with T. urticae (all stages including eggs). 
   Phytoseiulus persimilis was not reintroduced or redistributed during the
   course of the observations.  An auxiliary miticide (clofentezine) was
   applied on only one occasion to selected areas in the second tunnel. 
   The influence of high temperatures on control by P. persimilis is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in mean individual growth rate between populations of
   Chlamys tehuelcha (d'Orb.) from San Jose Gulf (Argentina) have been
   reported. These differences may reflect an environmental gradient in
   food availability. The objectives of this study were (a) to document
   statistically differences in scallop growth between several grounds of
   San Jose Gulf and (b) to discuss the consistency of the pattern with two
   alternative hypotheses: (H1) a gradient in food availability and (H2)
   density dependence. Two types of data were used to estimate growth rate:
   growth rings (five grounds) and the monthly average size (during 3
   years) of closely monitored strong cohorts (three grounds). The biomass
   and density of all scallop year classes, temperature and chlorophyll a
   were recorded monthly in the three grounds monitored. Carrying capacity
   (calculated annual production of bivalve meat, given net annual
   phytoplankton production) and annual production of scallop meat were
   estimated in the three grounds where cohorts were monitored.
   Statistically significant differences in individual growth rate were
   detected between populations. Growth was greater in the N and SW, and
   less in the SE of the Gulf. Environmental data were consistent with the
   food availability hypothesis. Growth rate was not correlated with mean
   scallop biomass (annual or 3 year averages). Estimated carrying capacity
   was lower in the SE than in the SW and N of the Gulf. Measured annual
   production of scallop meat and calculated carrying capacity were similar
   at each locality, independent of biomass. Intrapopulational variation in
   growth due to density dependence is very small compared to
   interpopulational differences due to food availability.}},

Abstract = {{(1) The fruiting of 307 Ficus trees in 74 ha of lowland forest at Kuala
   Lompat, Malaysia, was monitored monthly for 3 years.
   (2) The guild of twenty-nine species of bird-dispersed Ficus exhibited
   asynchronous fruiting phenology, with no recurrent annual pattern.  Fig
   crops were available in all 36 months of the study, but whilst
   medium-sized and small-sized figs were always available, crops of
   large-fruited (mean fig diameter of > 20 mm) bird-dispersed Ficus were
   scarce, with only around sixteen fruiting events year-1 km-2 of forest.
   (3) Seven Ficus species exhibited fruiting patterns which suggested some
   seasonality, with significantly more fruitings than expected in the
   period February-April.  This period is before the usual major annual
   community peak in fruiting, at a time when other fruit resources are
   relatively scarce.
   (4) Ficus forms a uniquely important group within the subset of plants
   with bird-eaten fruit because of their numerical abundance, intra-crown
   synchrony of fruit ripening, relatively short intervals between
   fruiting, large crop sizes and intra-population fruiting asynchrony. 
   These characteristics, combined with their availability at times when
   other fruits are scarce, makes Ficus a most important keystone plant
   resource.
   (5) For frugivores to be dependent on figs in South-east Asia they need
   to be wide-ranging.  Frugivorous birds with small home ranges may have
   to rely on keystone plants other than Ficus during some periods of fruit
   scarcity.}},

   appendiculatus Neumann, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi Neumann, Amblyomma
   variegatum (F.)., and Boophilus decoloratus (Koch) were monitored on
   East African shortorn Zebu cattle at monthly intervals for 2 yr.  These
   cattle were of unimproved stock under traditional husbandry without any
   tick control practices.  Most ticks were on cattle between September and
   March, with a peak in December-February.  Following the onset of the
   rainy season in April, tick numbers on the cattle declined markedly;
   this decline continued until July or August, when numbers started to
   increase again.  No significant correlation could be made between these
   population changes and any of the four climatic factors recorded. 
   Instead, there was a notable relationship between tick population
   changes and local farming practice.  The area and duration of cattle
   grazing activity were severely curtailed during the cropping season from
   April to September, which reduced tick-host contact and thus the tick
   burdens of the cattle at that time.}},

   RELATION TO SOCIAL-STATUS IN THE COOPERATIVELY BREEDING WHITE-BROWED
   SPARROW WEAVER, PLOCEPASSER-MAHALI}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{We have begun an intensive series of investigations into the
   environmental and endocrine mechanisms regulating cooperative breeding
   in a semi-arid tropical environment.  A colour-marked population of
   white-browed sparrow weavers (Plocepasser mahali) was studied at a field
   site near Nyamaluma Camp, Luangwa Valley, Zambia (13-degrees-S).  This
   species breeds from October to April, although some clutches may be
   found as early as August and young may be fed until May.
   Non-disruptive techniques were employed to monitor annual cycles of
   gonadal development, body mass and fat reserves, and small blood samples
   were collected to measure circulating levels of reproductive hormones
   and corticosterone.  All individuals were released after sampling and
   the social and reproductive activities recorded by systematic
   behavioural observations.  Each individual could thus be identified as: 
   (1) a breeding adult; (2) a related helper (i.e. offspring of the
   breeding male and female within the group); or (3) a non-related (=
   invader) helper (these birds helped defend territory but did not help
   feed young; they were not related to the breeding pair and usually
   originated from outside the group).
   Breeding males had larger testes and higher levels of testosterone than
   either related helpers or invader helpers.  In females, all status
   groups had follicles up to 2 mm in diameter, but only breeding females
   ovulated.  There were no differences in plasma levels of reproductive
   hormones among different status females, except for higher circulating
   luteinizing hormone (LH) in invader female helpers during the first part
   of the breeding season.  Although plasma levels of testosterone were
   highest in breeding males, the maximum titres were two orders of
   magnitude less than in males of passerine species from temperate
   regions.  Furthermore, injections of a peptide hormone GnRH
   (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) increased plasma LH levels in both
   males and females, and were followed by rises in testosterone levels
   only in males, but not over the normal maximum seen in February. 
   GnRH-induced high levels of LH did not affect testosterone
   concentrations in the blood of females.
   Results obtained thus far indicate that the hormonal control of
   aggression in white-browed sparrow weavers is different from that
   predicted by investigations on north temperate species.  Whether these
   phenomena are typical of tropical species, particularly coopertive
   breeders, remains to be determined.  Since most of the world's species
   of birds live in the tropics, and a substantial fraction of them breed
   cooperatively, more investigations are needed to establish the hormonal
   basis of reproductive behaviour and cooperative breeding.  Given the
   baseline data already collected, the white-browed sparrow weaver will be
   a useful model.}},

Abstract = {{The retention mechanism of a population of the estuarine copepod
   Eurytemora affinis (Poppe) was determined within a strongly tidal, mixed
   estuary. Sampling in the water column at sites along the estuary was
   carried out to assess any tidal, diel and semilunar patterns of change.
   The species showed distinct tidal differences in abundance with
   horizontal position, being maximally abundant on the flood tide at the
   most seaward site and on the ebb tide at the landward site, suggesting
   differential tidal swimming, leading to accumulation at an intermediate
   point. Monitoring over a springs-neaps-springs cycle suggested that the
   position of this point changed over the semi-lunar cycle, with greatest
   numbers on flood tides over springs and on ebb tides over neaps. This
   was confirmed by repeated sampling along the length of the estuary; a
   specific region was identified where very high numbers of E. affinis
   occurred. This horizontal position changed between springs and neaps,
   apparently maintaining the bulk of the population within a specific
   salinity zone. Sampling throughout the water column showed these
   horizontal movements to be facilitated by tidal vertical migrations.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to establish whether populations of fish species
   important in the catches of rock and surf anglers increased following
   the proclamation of the De Hoop Marine Reserve on the southern coast of
   South Africa. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) and size frequency
   distributions of angling species were monitored approximately monthly by
   angling from the shore at 2 sites in the reserve. At one site sampling
   commenced 2 yr before the reserve was established and continued 4.5 yr
   thereafter, allowing comparisons of periods of exploitation and
   protection. The other site had a long history of minimal exploitation
   and data collected there 2.5 to 4.5 yr after complete protection was
   considered to represent an unexploited condition. Ten species accounted
   for 99\% of the catch. Following establishment of the reserve, CPUE
   increased for 6 of these (galjoen Coracinus capensis, dassie Diplodus
   sargus, wildeperd D. cervinus, white steenbras Lithognathus
   lithognathus, Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi and musselcracker
   Sparodon durbanensis). The catch rates of 2 species (C. capensis and D.
   sargus) improved 4 to 5 fold within 2 yr of protection and remained at
   these high levels, which were similar to the unexploited catch rates.
   Recoveries were slower amongst the other 4 species, their catch rates
   reaching 30 to 60\% of the unexploited level after 2.5 to 4.5 yr of
   protection. This study provides evidence of general stock recoveries of
   exploited fish species in a shallow marine habitat following protection
   within a marine reserve.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for sampling turfgrass tissue were compared for their
   effectiveness in monitoring Pythium blight epidemics with enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Sample areas consisted of marked strips on
   golf course fairways and tees with bentgrass and annual bluegrass
   naturally infested by Pythium aphanidermatum.  Samples consisted of 1)
   whole plants picked by hand and assayed as whole plants; 2) whole plants
   sectioned into lower, middle, and upper strata components; and 3) leaf
   clippings collected with a reel mower set at a 1.2-cm cutting height. 
   ELISA readings for mowed samples generally matched those for
   whole-plucked samples (r2 values ranging from 0.457 to 0.601). 
   Fluctuations in detectable Pythium antigens were most pronounced on the
   uppermost stratum compared with moderate to very little change in ELISA
   readings for the two lower strata.  Several episodes of Pythium antigen
   increase were detected by ELISA assays of mowed samples, although signs
   and symptoms of Pythium blight were not evident.  However, increases in
   ELISA readings for Pythium coincided with, but did not generally
   precede, the onset of blight symptoms with a 2- to 3-day sampling
   interval.  Antibody-aided detection is useful for verification of
   diagnosis and determination of general Pythium population fluctuations,
   but current methodology is not satisfactory for advanced detection of
   blight epidemics.}},

Year = {{1991}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{5-26}},

Abstract = {{Annual measurements of pyrethroid resistance levels in field populations
   of Heliothis virescens (F.) in Mississippi indicated that resistance has
   been present since 1986. Direct measurements of resistance levels were
   made by topical, adult vial, and sprayed plant assays with insects
   collected from field populations. Indirect measurements included annual
   small plot efficacy studies conducted throughout cotton growing areas of
   the United States.
   Results of topical assays indicated that variation existed in
   dosage-mortality responses prior to 1986. Since 1986, some field
   colonies collected each year exhibited higher LD-50's and LD-90's than
   those for known susceptible strains. Sprayed plant assays indicated that
   pyrethroid resistance was high enough to significantly reduce mortality
   of third instar larvae on treated cotton. Adult assays indicated that
   pyrethroid resistance tends to increase in Mississippi as the growing
   season progresses and that resistance is spreading geographically.
   Trends for reduced larval control were identified in small plot data
   summarized for Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, mississippi, and Texas.
   In general, all four monitoring techniques were effective in documenting
   the presence of insecticide resistance. Limitations and advantages of
   the different techniques are examined.}},

Abstract = {{Adult male tobacco budworms, Heliothis virescens (F.), were field
   collected in Arizona, California and Texas during the years 1980 to
   1989. Larvae from these population samples were subjected to topical
   evaluations with cypermethrin. Data from these tests were compared to
   similarly generated data with larvae from susceptible laboratory and
   field strains collected in Georgia. Tobacco budworm larvae from the
   southwestern states were found to be considerably less susceptible to
   cypermethrin than the reference strains. Susceptibility levels, as shown
   by the topical tests, remained stable from 1980 to 1986 although some of
   the least susceptible larvae were identified from population samples
   collected in Arizona and Texas in 1980 and 1982. The least susceptible
   population identified was collected from Brazos Co., Texas in 1988 and
   was from a field which had experienced a tobacco budworm control
   problem. In 1987, field monitoring was begun using the adult vial test.
   Results of these tests show there is considerable geographical and
   seasonal variation in the susceptibility data. Data from the adult vial
   test also indicated low pyrethroid susceptibility in Brazos Co., Texas.
   The 10 ug per vial rate was an indicator of changing susceptibility but
   levels less than 20\% survival between tests were usually not
   statistically different. Both tests indicated variable pyrethroid
   susceptibility with location and season.}},

Abstract = {{Field populations of tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), have
   been monitored annually since 1977 with topical applications of
   synthetic pyrethroid insecticides (primarily permethrin) and methyl
   parathion to detect changes in insecticide susceptibility. These data
   showed that LD50's fluctuated somewhat from year to year with
   permethrin, but the fluctuations were not sufficient to change levels of
   expected control in the field. Field populations continue to show
   susceptibility to permethrin even though one Maricopa County population
   showed an increase in the LD50 to 12.4 in 1988. Field populations
   continue to show resistance to methyl parathion and susceptibility to
   permethrin. Little difference in susceptibility between permethrin and
   fenvalerate was found.}},

Abstract = {{An uncomplicated method is described for obtaining highly intact
   plastids from storage roots of sugar beet Beta vulgaris L.  The method
   is based on differential precipitation of organelles with subsequent
   purification in a stepped gradient of Percoll.  Mature freshly harvested
   roots yield two populations of plastids with different buoyant density,
   heavy and light, whereas only a light population is isolated from roots
   stored for a long time.  Some characteristics of the light population of
   organelles are cited.  The degree of plastid intactness was judged from
   the ratio of the rates of oxidation of exogenous 6-phosphogluconate by
   specific intraplastid dehydrogenase before and after treatment of the
   organelles with 0.05\% Triton X-100.  It was about 90\%.  Purity of the
   obtained fraction was monitored with the aid of marker enzymes, as well
   as electron microscopy.  The isolated organelles contained endogenous
   sucrose and utilized UDP {[}C-14]-glucose at a very high rate in
   comparison with C-14-sucrose and C-14-glucose-1-phosphate.  More than
   90\% of radioactivity here was detected in the fraction of carbohydrate
   polymers.  It is hypothesized that a vector mechanism of UDPG transport
   coupled with synthesis of carbohydrate polymers exists in the plastid
   envelope.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring, 1973 to 1987, of reactions to liming and
   reacidification of a forest lake ecosystem near the Swedish west coast
   is reported in this study.  Treatment of Lake Lysevatten with a slag
   product of limestone in 1974 resulted in neutralization and a positive
   alkalinity.  Prolonged dissolution proceeded for about 7 yr whereby 86\%
   dissolved.  During 1984-86 Lake Lysevatten approached maximum
   reacidification with high Al concentrations and an affected biota. 
   Asellus aquaticus L. decreased and dominance within chironomid groups
   approached preliming conditions.  However, the most obvious biological
   change was the development of the filamentous algal genus Mougeotia and
   increased growth of Sphagnum.  Populations of both plants increased
   notably when pH declined to about 5.  Our study suggests that extensive
   reacidification (pH < 6.0) of limed lakes should be avoided by
   successive treatments to prevent development of destabilized lake
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Hickey color banded and monitored 2373 Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata)
   from 1953 until 1976 at her bird-feeder in Madison, Wisconsin.  The mean
   annual survival rate of Blue Jays calculated from reobservation and
   recapture data by the Jolly-Seber method was 0.54.  The annual survival
   rates of juvenile and adult jays calculated from band returns by the
   life table approach were 0.45 and 0.53, respectively.  Forty-three Blue
   Jays lived to be at least seven years old, and the oldest Blue Jay
   reported was a 14-year-old mated male.
   The abundance of Blue Jays fluctuated seasonally and annually.  Peak
   numbers occurred during the breeding season (xBAR = 99.0 individuals)
   after young fledged, and low numbers occurred during the non-breeding
   season (xBAR = 21.3 individuals). The annual abundance of Blue Jays was
   not correlated with abundance of acorn mast.
   Blue Jay populations increased between 1953 and 1976, but changes in
   numbers were not correlated with local changes in survival rates, rates
   of reproduction, or changes in migratory behavior. The data are most
   consistent with the hypothesis that regional changes in survival rates
   occurred during this time period, and these changes were then reflected
   in a local increase in the abundance of Blue Jays.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about how climatic events (i.e., drought) inhibit or
   enhance movement of petroleum hydrocarbon laden sediments in estuarine
   systems and how this in turn effects the macrobenthic populations
   exposed to these sediments. Seventeen collection stations were
   established and monitored at New Bayou, Texas, a small gradient estuary
   which receives petroleum products via oil/gas field produced water
   discharge. Hydrographic, geologic and biotic samples were taken monthly
   from each station during a period of reduced rainfall.
   Both temperature and dissolved oxygen data taken during the study
   followed patterns typical for the area. Salinity values increased into
   the polyhaline range at near-bay stations during the reduced rain
   period, while upper bayou stations remained within the oligohaline
   range.
   Sediment grain sizes along the bayou were generally in the silty-clay
   range. Sediment hydrocarbon concentrations were highest (11.4 mg g-1 dry
   sediment) around the produced water discharge site and lowest at
   near-bay stations (0.2 mg g-1 dry sediment). Ninety-six macrobenthic
   species were collected during the study. General effects from produced
   water discharge on macrobenthic populations followed the classical
   pattern outlined by other research in shallow bay systems. A sediment
   hydrocarbon concentration of 2.5 mg g-1 dry sediment was found to
   reflect the average value needed to depress population abundances. Both
   abundance and diversity values were lowest at central stations near the
   discharge site. This zone of depressed macrobenthic populations extended
   from the discharge site at least 107 m downstream and 46 m upstream. The
   zone of stimulated macrobenthic populations occurred 1486 m downstream
   and 381 m upstream from the discharge site.}},

Abstract = {{A canonical approach to predicting phytoplankton communities with the
   desired taxonomic resolution is presented, with a description of the
   statistical outline and a case study.  Canonical correlation analysis
   defines new uncorrelated variates as linear combinations of the original
   variables, maximizing the correlation between phytoplankton taxa and
   environmental variables.  These canonical variates have been used to
   construct an easily estimable multivariate linear model.  The
   performance of the approach was studied using monitoring data on a
   eutrophic lake covering 20 years.  Water temperature, three N and two P
   fractions, the N/P ratio and pH were correlated with phytoplankton,
   using a number of different taxonomic resolutions.  The focus was on the
   species level, at which the algal associations tended to follow the
   taxonomic hierarchy, especially with cyanobacteria and chromophytes. 
   The adequacy of the predictions generally improved when the resolution
   and consequently the diagnostic potential was decreased.  A model of the
   proposed type, once set up using applicable case-specific data, can be
   used for predictions of phytoplankton, bacteria or any multispecies
   biotic community, in cases where the growth factors can be measured or
   predicted with substantially higher accuracy or speed or with much lower
   expenses.}},

Abstract = {{Polydnaviruses appear to be essential for the establishment of
   compatible interactions between lepidopteran hosts and a select group of
   ichneumonid or braconid parasitoids. The symbiotic association of the
   wasps and viruses is efficiently maintained between wasp generations.
   Molecular analyses of the polydnavirus Campoletis sonorensis virus (CsV)
   and its parasitoid wasp host indicate that the CsV genome is integrated
   in the wasp's chromosomal DNA, suggesting that polydnaviruses like CsV
   probably are transmitted through the wasp germline and can be expected
   to follow Mendelian patterns of inheritance. Restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms have been detected in the genomes of polydnaviruses from
   many wasp species, including C. sonorensis, and are potentially useful
   as genetic markers that can be used to monitor inheritance patterns or
   populations within a wasp species. The implications of integrated
   polydnaviral DNAs for biocontrol are discussed with reference to the
   species specificity of the viruses and their potential for genetic
   mapping. (C) 1991 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Journal = {{CONDOR}},

Abstract = {{Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) staminate flower buds are an
   important winter food for Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus); however, use
   of these buds can vary among years.  One explanation for this
   differential use of aspen flower buds is that the buds' nutritional
   value or palatability changes.  It has been proposed that fluctuations
   in the chemical content of aspen buds may affect their utilization by
   Ruffed Grouse, and that the utilization of aspen may be positively
   related to the population density these birds can maintain.  This paper
   focuses on three key links of the above hypothesis:  whether there are
   significant annual changes in the chemistry of aspen buds, whether aspen
   utilization by Ruffed Grouse is mediated by the chemistry of the buds,
   and whether there is a correlation between aspen use and changes in
   grouse densities.  We monitored chemical changes in aspen flower buds
   periodically over 11 years and related chemical changes to aspen use and
   Ruffed Grouse densities.  Additionally, previous studies were
   re-examined to determine the relationship between aspen consumption and
   changes in grouse densities.  Significant differences were observed in
   coniferyl benzoate and protein levels among years.  Data suggest that
   there may be inherent differences among aspen clones in their ability to
   chemically defend themselves.  Use of aspen buds by grouse appears to be
   mediated by coniferyl benzoate and protein levels.  Quaking aspen use
   was highly correlated to Ruffed Grouse densities.  Lack of suitable or
   available aspen in the winter may increase predation risks and energetic
   costs for Ruffed Grouse.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of defoliation on gypsy moth fecundity and male moth wing
   length and the relationship between male moth wing length and egg mass
   density were investigated.  Male pupae and egg masses were collected
   from plots located in the leading edge area of the gypsy moth
   infestation in Virginia and Maryland.  Defoliation and egg mass density
   estimates were made in each plot.  Male pupae were allowed to emerge,
   and the left forewings of 2,636 moths were measured to determine wing
   length.  Fecundity was determined volumetrically for 767 egg masses. 
   Gypsy moth fecundity and male wing length decreased substantially only
   when defoliation exceeded a threshold level of almost-equal-to 40\%. 
   There was a minimal change in fecundity and male wing length due to
   increasing levels of defoliation above or below this threshold.  Thus,
   the effect of defoliation on male wing length and fecundity is
   essentially binomial (i.e., male wing lengthy is either large or small
   and fecundity is either high or low).  Wing length of male moths
   explained only almost-equal-to 10\% of the variation in egg mass density
   in the area where pupae were collected.  The wing length of moths
   captured in pheromone traps used in conjunction with the number of moths
   captured may be useful for monitoring gypsy moth populations.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of 6000 nonsmoking California
   Seventh-Day Adventists were monitored for a 6-year period, and
   relationships with long-term cumulative ambient air pollution were
   observed.  Total suspended particulates (TSP) and ozone were measured in
   terms of numbers of hours in excess of several threshold levels
   corresponding to national standards as well as mean concentration.  For
   all malignant neoplasms among females, risk increased with increasing
   exceedance frequencies of all thresholds of TSP except the lowest one,
   and those increased risks were highly statistically significant.  For
   respiratory cancers, increased risk was associated with only one
   threshold of ozone, and this result was of borderline significance.
   Respiratory disease symptoms were assessed in 1977 and again in 1987
   using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute respiratory symptoms
   questionnaire on a subcohort of 3914 individuals.  Multivariate analyses
   which adjusted for past and passive smoking and occupational exposures
   indicated statistically significantly (p < 0.05) elevated relative risks
   ranging up to 1.7 for incidence of asthma, definite symptoms of airway
   obstructive disease, and chronic bronchitis with TSP in excess of all
   thresholds except the lowest one but not for any thresholds of ozone.  A
   trend association (p = 0.056) was noted between the threshold of 10 pphm
   ozone and incidence of asthma.  These results are presented within the
   context of standards setting for these constituents of air pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Under a cooperative agreement between New York University and the
   Environmental Protection Agency, and in collaboration with the
   University of Sao Paulo (USP), a study is ongoing in Cubatao, Brazil, to
   try to establish exposure-response relationships on the impact of
   specific industrial effluents on respiratory function in school-age
   children.  Cubatao, located on the coast about 44 km from the city of
   Sao Paulo, is surrounded by U-shaped mountains (approximately 800 m)
   covered with subtropical forests.  Its area is approximately 160 km2,
   and it has a population of approximately 90,000.  The geography is such
   that it causes a consistent diurnal land-sea breeze pattern and the
   opposite during the night, with low dispersion of the air pollutants. 
   In a small area (approximately 40 km2) against the mountains there is a
   concentration of over 20 large plants:  oil refinery; iron and steel
   mill; fertilizer, cement, and gypsum production; coke kilns; and
   chemical, paint, and many other ancillary plants.  During the 1988
   school year, March through June, August through November, 600
   six-year-old children, attending six different kindergarten schools,
   underwent monthly spirometry tests.  Because the children live within a
   500 m radius of their school, pollution monitors were located on each of
   the six schools.  Particles were collected using dichotomous stacked
   filter units placed on 20 m towers to reduce the influence of dust from
   unpaved roads.  The units use different pore size filters for coarse, 2
   to 10-mu-m, and fine particles, (dp) < 2-mu-m, and took separate samples
   for day and nighttime.  Three sites are in the densely populated
   downtown area, one is on a newly developed outskirt area, and the last
   two are residential areas, far from industries, up on the side of the
   surrounding hills (elevations, 95 and 200 m).  The yearly average
   thoracic aerosol mass concentration (PM10) is very high on all sites,
   ranging from 59 +/- 39-mu-m/m3 to 240 +/- 122-mu-m/m3, the number of
   days with mean PM10 > 100-mu-m/m3 range from 27 to 98\% depending on
   neighborhood.  There has not been a significant reduction of ambient
   PM10 concentrations since 1985, when previous studies by USP showed
   grossly abnormal lung function in kindergarten children.  The initial
   analyses on the current study show that respiratory airflow rates are
   significantly associated with PM10 concentrations during the previous
   month.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate contamination of drinking water implies a genotoxic risk to man
   due to the endogenous formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds from
   nitrate-derived nitrite.  Thus far, epidemiological studies have
   presented conflicting results on the relation of drinking water nitrate
   levels with gastric cancer incidence.  This uncertainty becomes of
   relevance in view of the steadily increasing nitrate levels in regular
   drinking water supplies.  In an attempt to apply genetic biomarker
   analysis to improve the basis for risk assessment with respect to
   drinking water nitrate contamination, this study evaluates peripheral
   lymphocyte chromosomal damage in human populations exposed to low,
   medium, and high drinking water nitrate levels, the latter being present
   in private water wells.  It is shown that nitrate contamination of
   drinking water causes dose-dependent increases in nitrate body load as
   monitored by 24-hr urinary nitrate excretion in female volunteers, but
   this appears not to be associated with peripheral lymphocyte sister
   chromatid exchange frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Field trials to evaluate bait uptake by urban foxes were performed
   in three areas in Bristol, U.K.  Seasonal uptake was investigated by
   laying and monitoring uptake of bait at 2-month intervals throughout the
   year in the principal experimental area.  A biomarker (iophenoxic acid)
   was incorporated in one of the summer and one of the winter trials, and
   subsequently foxes were captured in that area to examine for elevated
   levels of protein-bound iodine in the blood.  Bait uptake at different
   bait densities per fox was investigated in the other two areas.
   (2) There was a steady increase in the proportion of baits investigated
   and taken from January/February to September/October, with a slight
   decrease at the end of the year.  There was considerable variation in
   the proportion of baits taken in different habitat types.  Of the foxes
   sampled, in the summer 35\% of adults and 17\% of cubs, and in the
   winter 29\% of adults and 23\% of sub-adults, were positive for the
   biomarker.  When the number of baits avialable per fox was doubled, the
   rate of bait uptake per fox increased in the same proportion.
   (3) The results obtained were compared with bait uptake from rural foxes
   in Europe and North America.  Bait uptake in Bristol was generally lower
   than in other studies, as was the proportion of biomarked individuals. 
   The differences in bait uptake in Bristol, throughout the season and at
   different bait densities per fox, are discussed in relation to fox
   foraging behaviour and ecology.  Mathematical models predict that at
   least 75\% control levels are necessary to prevent rabies outbreaks from
   spreading, with even higher levels of control needed in some urban
   areas, and the results presented here show that a control strategy based
   on a baiting campaign using the protocol currently favoured in Britain
   is unlikely to reach a large enough proportion of the fox population to
   control a rabies outbreak.}},

   bollworm, E. insulana (Boisd.) (Lep., Noctuidae) by synthetic sex
   pheromone traps and relationship between moth catches and larval
   infestation in bolls of cotton. The traps were baited with 1 mg of sex
   pheromone (10E,12E)-10,12-hexadecadienal; and 10:2 mixture of
   (10E,12E)-10,12-hexadecadienal and (Z)-11-hexadecenal for spiny and
   spotted bollworms respectively. The daily catches of spotted and spiny
   bollworm moths were variable, however, average catches per night were
   positively correlated with the larval infestation in cotton bolls.
   Average nightly number of moths captured in pheromone baited traps were
   also positively correlated with the number of larvae per plant. The
   larval population in the fruiting bodies of cotton and the moth counts
   in pheromone traps increased with the developmental stages of the crop.
   The peak moth population and larval infestation of spotted and spiny
   bollworms was observed in the months of August and October respectively.
   Results indicated that a mean trap catches of 9-12 moths per night of
   spotted bollworm was associated with economic injury level of
   infestation. Although, a maximum of 12 moths per trap per night in the
   month of October were captured in case of spiny bollworm but the
   infestation remained below economic threshold i.e. 10 \% damage.}},

Abstract = {{Discriminating bioassays are increasingly being used to detect
   resistance and estimate the frequency (F) of resistant (R) phenotypes in
   field populations.  The proportion of survivors in discriminating
   bioassays is thought to measure the frequency of R phenotypes in the
   population.  External factors that cause physiological stress in a field
   population may alter response to a discriminating concentration and
   affect estimates of F.  Because susceptible (S) phenotypes already die
   at the discriminating concentration, only the response of R phenotypes
   changes.  Thus, estimates of F will be biased and populations under
   stress will appear to be more susceptible than they really are. 
   Repeated discriminating bioassays of the European red mite, Panonychus
   ulmi (Koch), showed variability in estimates of F.  Repeated bioassays
   of P. ulmi from commercial apple orchards were used to construct a
   cumulative distribution function that describes the probability that R
   phenotypes die in the discriminating bioassay.  This distribution
   function was then used in simulations to explore the effect of
   day-to-day variability in tolerance of R phenotypes on resistance
   monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in hexythiazox (Savey) toxicity to the eggs of spider mites
   (Tetranychus spp.) from six laboratory colonies and 26 field collections
   (5-6 each from cotton, almonds, pears, roses, and strawberries) was
   determined using a leaf disk bioassay method.  The difference in the
   response of T. urticae Koch and T. pacificus McGregor to hexythiazox was
   10-fold when contact and residual methods were compared.  Intraspecies
   differences in susceptibility were found with laboratory colonies of
   both T. urticae and T. pacificus, indicating that a low level of
   cross-resistance to other compounds may exist.  Variation in
   susceptibility of field-collected spider mites to hexythiazox within and
   between crops was also found for both species.  Field collected T.
   urticae were significantly more susceptible to hexythiazox than were
   field-collected T. pacificus.  Few significant differences were found
   when responses of field-collected spider mites tested on their original
   host plant leaves were compared with responses on cotton cotyledons in
   the laboratory.  The use of laboratory-reared cotton had far more
   advantages than the use of host leaves.  These results suggest that
   continued monitoring of hexythiazox susceptibility, determination of
   cross-resistance patterns, and the implementation of resistance
   management tactics are warranted before and after this compound is

Abstract = {{Aerial water pan pheromone traps were used to monitor flights of the
   European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), in two locations in
   South Dakota during 1987 and at three sites in Illinois in 1988.  Our
   objective was to evaluate the effect of different pheromone septa
   replacement intervals on European corn borer moth captures in aerial
   water pan pheromone traps.  At each location, four treatments were
   arranged in a randomized complete-block design.  The treatments
   consisted of differing the length of time pheromone septa were allowed
   to remain in the water pan traps and were as follows:  (1) septa
   replaced weekly, (2) septa replaced biweekly (once every 2 wk), (3)
   septa replaced every 3 wk or monthly, and (4) traps used without septa. 
   Results indicate that even when pheromone septa are changed very
   infrequently (3 wk to monthly), distinct flights of male European corn
   borer moths can be detected.  Moth captures were generally greater in
   water pan traps in which septa were changed weekly; however, in many
   instances, no significant differences in trap catches occurred among the
   three pheromone replacement treatments.  When European corn borer
   populations are very low, the length of time between pheromone septa
   replacement may not significantly affect the capture of male moths. 
   Replacement of pheromone septa on a biweekly basis should work
   satisfactorily for a large-scale monitoring program where expense is a
   concern.}},

Abstract = {{Pitfall traps and grain samples taken with a vacuum probe provided data
   on insect infestation in farm-stored wheat in 26 Kansas counties. 
   Insects were monitored at 65-d intervals from July 1986 through March
   1987.  Early detection when populations were low in July and March was
   accomplished best by pitfall traps.  The traps detected insects in
   61.5\% of the bins of wheat within 1 mo of harvest.  In September and
   November, > 95\% of the bins were infested.  More than half the bins
   contained Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), an especially damaging pest of
   Kansas farm-stored grain.  Absence of insects in either traps or grain
   samples could not be interpreted as proof that grain was insect-free. 
   Each method was a more efficient detector of infestations than the other
   in certain seasons and for certain insects.  The center of the grain
   mass contained a significantly greater percentage of the total number of
   insects in grain samples from September to January and a significantly
   greater percentage of the trapped insects from July to March than other
   positions.  Correlation coefficients relating the number of all insects
   in traps to the number in grain samples taken directly below the traps
   did not exceed 0.65 until March.  In September and November, when insect
   populations were greatest, 25 insects were captured in traps for each
   insect in grain samples.  In January, the ratio decreased to 9:1.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance of the common intertidal barnacles, Chthamalus montagui,
   Chthamalus stellatus, Semibalanus balanoides and Elminius modestus has
   been monitored since 1951 at a site near Cellar Beach, River Yealm,
   south Devon. Counts are made at 12 levels on a transect between high
   tide and low tide. The two chthamalids are of warm-water distribution
   while S. balanoides is a boreo-arctic species; changes in the abundance
   of these species are linked to environmental temperature. Maximum
   fluctuations occur in the lowermost third of the intertidal zone. The
   proportion of Chthamalus adults is correlated with annual mean inshore
   sea temperature two years earlier, while the proportion of S. balanoides
   adults is negatively so correlated. This relationship accounts for over
   40\% of the variance. A smaller part of the variance (< 20\%) is
   explained by intensity of larval settlement, also related to climate.
   The fourth barnacle, E. modestus, is an Australasian immigrant that
   arrived in England during World War 11 and reached south Devon in 1948.
   It increased during the 1950s on the transect but has since stabilized
   at a low level of abundance that shows large interannual variations not
   directly related to temperature. Between 1951 and 1975, coinciding with
   a secular decline in sea temperature, there was a long-term trend
   towards reduction of Chthamalus and increase in S. balanoides; this
   trend has reversed since. Removal of the long-term trend reveals a
   short-term fluctuation of approximately 10-y frequency that correlates
   with a cycle in sea temperature two years earlier. These cycles are
   close to the 10-11 y solar (sunspot) cycle between 1951 and 1975. The
   biological data have since diverged from the solar cycle and now show
   less fit with annual mean sea temperature. Changing weather patterns and
   other effects of global climate shift may be involved.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial distribution of juvenile and adult sea scallops Placopecten
   magellanicus (Gmelin) was studied from video-monitored sled-dredge
   samples in commercial scallop beds of eastern Georges Bank (Northwest
   Atlantic). Maximum densities of 1 and 2 yr old individuals, as well as
   of adults, were recorded in the northern area of the study. Abundance of
   scallops was significantly higher on gravel than on the other sediment
   types. Scallops appeared to exhibit a Poisson distribution within
   sediment type. Distribution of juveniles only partly matched that of
   adults; age 1 individuals were less dispersed than 2 yr olds and adults,
   and were mainly located on a gravel-pebble deposit in the northern half
   of the Bank. It is inferred that movements associated with tidal
   currents occur as the individuals grow older. The relative abundances of
   pre-recruits and recruits emphasize the impact of fishing activity on
   size structure. Growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy function would
   indicate that Lee's phenomenon acts on the population. Age 2 juveniles
   showed a strong depth-related decrease in shell growth, linked to
   temperature and probably to food availability. The sampling technique
   employed has the potential for establishing pre-recruitment indices for
   use in management of this fishery.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 139 and 206 rice fields in 12 Burmese states and divisions
   were monitored during the wet seasons of 1986 and 1987, respectively. 
   Pest populations were generally low.  No species exceeded the relatively
   conservative Burmese pest threshold levels in more than 10 \% of the
   fields each year.  Even though insecticides were not applied when
   infestations exceeded thresholds, rice yields were not significantly
   reduced.  As a consequence, higher action levels for selected Burmese
   rice pests are proposed.  The originally used decision system was based
   on enumerative sampling.  High correlations were found between this
   approach and the proposed binomial strategy which only counts absence or
   presence of pests or pest damage.  This method stands a good chance of
   being adopted by Burmese rice farmers.  Unfortunately, further studies
   had to be discontinued as a consequence of the political disturbances in
   Burma in August 1988.}},

Abstract = {{As a shallow, productive lake in the drainage system between Lake Huron
   and Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair provides habitat for a diverse biota
   including significant populations of fish and wildlife that are of use
   to man.  Of the more than 70 species of native and migrant fishes, 43
   use the lake for spawning.  Peak numbers of waterfowl utilizing the lake
   and adjoining wetlands have been estimated at 60 000 in spring and 150
   000 in autumn.  In addition to recreational fishing and hunting, the
   lake is also used for swimming, boating and as a source of municipal
   water.  It is located downstream from an industrial centre and adjacent
   to a population estimated at about four million.  Mercury contamination
   closed the fisheries in 1970 and concentrations of the metal persist
   above consumption guidelines in some species.  Almost all of the
   Michigan shoreline is urbanized and much of it altered through dyking
   and bulkheading.  Coastal wetlands of the lake have declined 41 percent
   in the past century and only about one-half of the remaining area is
   open to the lake.
   Despite impacts from the large urban population and users, ecosystem
   quality remains reasonably good.  The flushing action of relatively
   clean water from Lake Huron has slowed the eutrophication process. 
   Major habitat problems are toxic substances from industries located on
   the St. Clair River and the continued loss of shoreline and wetlands to
   urbanization and agriculture.  Further research and monitoring of
   sources, fates and impacts of toxic substances in sediments and biota
   are required.  In addition, there is a need for environmental and
   economic evaluations of shorelines and wetlands to prevent further
   losses of these important habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Yolk-sac larvae of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were exposed to
   four sequential low pH and calcium (Ca) pulses, nominally ranging from
   pH 6.5 to 4.0 in 0.5 pH unit increments, with and without 300-mu-g/l
   aluminium (Al) in 28-day toxicity tests.  Calcium concentrations during
   the pulses varied from 0.5 to 1.3 mg/l.  Swim-up larvae that had begun
   to feed were exposed to a single pulse of the same pH and Ca
   concentrations with 300-mu-g/l Al.  The larvae were allowed to recover
   for 120-h at circumneutral pH and Ca concentration that varied from 2.1
   to 3.3 mg/l after each pulse exposure.  Effects of the pulse exposures
   on survival, growth, whole-body ion concentrations, and behavioral
   development were monitored.  Mortality of larvae was significant in all
   low pH and Ca treatments with Al after the first pulse and after the
   first low pH and Ca pulse at pH 4.0.  Growth was significantly reduced
   among larvae exposed to the low pH and Ca pulses at pH 4.0.  In general,
   growth was most severely affected among larvae exposed to the low pH and
   Ca pulses with Al at pH 6.1 and lower.  Relative to controls, the low pH
   and Ca pulse exposures with and without Al reduced whole-body Na+, Ca2+,
   K+, Mg2+, P, and Cl-.  Whole-body Ca2+ was most severely reduced
   followed by Na+, K+, Cl-, P, and Mg2+.  The pulse exposures also caused
   delayed development and significant reductions in swimming activity and
   feeding of the larvae.  These results support field observations that
   cyclic pH and Ca depressions, and concurrent increases in Al
   concentrations may cause mortality and have other adverse effects on
   natural fish populations.}},

Abstract = {{Attendance by male Black Grouse was studied at 4 leks in north Wales in
   spring 1987 and 1988.  The number of males at individual leks varied
   depending on time of day and season.  The highest counts were obtained
   in April and early May, 1 hr either side of sunrise.  Counts were also
   made on 45 of the 91 recorded display sites in north Wales, mainly
   between 04.00-05.00 hours in May 1988 and the results compared with data
   collected in 1986.  Twenty-nine per cent of sites had more males in
   1988, 47\% had fewer males and 24\% were unchanged.  Overall, numbers
   had apparently increased by 4\% but this did not necessarily reflect
   changes in the population.  Leks in forests had declined more than those
   on moorland.  Recommendations are made for standardizing survey
   methodology and for monitoring Black Grouse populations in Wales.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding bird populations were monitored for three years after an
   October prescribed burn in a fescue grassland near Saskatoon,
   Saskatchewan.  Breeding populations of 12 species were recorded on a
   12.9 ha burned plot and an adjacent 5.6 ha unburned plot, each with
   similar vegetation.  The two most common species, Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) and Clay-coloured Sparrow (Spizella pallida)
   were both adversely affected by the burn.  By the third post-burn year,
   density of Savannah Sparrows was 68\% of the value (1.70 pairs/ha)
   observed in the unburned area, while Clay-coloured Sparrows were only
   33\% of the density (1.07 pairs/ha) noted in the unburned area.  Other
   important species, Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii) and Western
   Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) were adversely affected initially by the
   burn but by the third year, population densities in the burned and
   unburned areas were comparable.  Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii)
   did not use the burned area in the first year, but as the grassy canopy
   became reestablished, the burned area was utilized at moderate densities
   in the second year, and in the third post-burn year densities were
   identical in burned and unburned ares (0.27 pairs/ha).  Only the Vesper
   Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) showed a preference for the burned area in
   the first year after the burn.}},

Abstract = {{The colonization potential of the northwardly migrating weed Solanum
   ptycanthum was evaluated by comparing germination profiles of southern
   agrestal populations with northern marginal populations sampled from
   both ruderal and agrestal habitats. Under laboratory conditions, the
   seed from five maternal families from each population was subjected to
   six light:dark temperature regimes from 18:8 to 40:30-degrees-C and
   germination rate (time to 50\% germination) and final percent
   germination were monitored. The base temperature and thermal time
   (degree-days) required for 50\% germination were calculated. Seeds from
   southern agrestal populations germinated over a broader temperature
   range than northern agrestal populations but had similar rates of
   germination, base temperatures, and thermal times. At the northern range
   limit, ruderal populations germinated faster and had smaller thermal
   times than agrestal populations but had similar base temperatures.
   Delayed emergence in agrestal habitats may be a response to cultural
   practices. Seeds from northern populations were heavier than southern
   populations. Plasticity of germination response to temperature did not
   differ between populations. The observed levels of genetic variability
   in all germination parameters suggest that future range expansion would
   be possible.}},

   observed within 7 days of cyanophage inoculation.  When inoculated
   during the early growth stages, population expansion of cyanobacteria
   was reduced by 80 to 95\% in all three species.  Inoculation of

Abstract = {{We used a register of photographed individuals to census greater
   one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis, hereafter rhinoceros) in
   Royal Chitwan National Park (NP), Nepal, between 1984 and 1988. By April
   1988, the population was estimated to be 358-376 individuals as
   determined by regression analysis. The observed rate of increase for the
   Sauraha population, an intensively monitored subpopulation in the
   central and eastern part of Royal Chitwan NP, was 4.8\% between 1984 and
   1988 and 2.5\% between 1975 and 1988. The Sauraha population included 87
   adult females and 58 breeding-age males, of which only 28 males were
   judged to have bred during the study period. Annual calf production
   averaged 7.6 +/- 0.8\% (xBAR +/- SE) between 1984 and 1988. No distinct
   season of parturition was detected. Predation by tigers (Panthera
   tigris) accounted for 4 of 7 calf mortalities, and all 7 calves that
   died during the study period were < 8 months old. Mean annual mortality
   within the calf, subadult, and adult age categories was estimated to be
   2.8, 2.2, and 2.9\%, respectively.
   Rhinoceros populations reached maximum densities of 13.3/km2 in riverine
   forest-Saccharum spontaneum grassland mosaics along the Rapti River.
   Local densities in areas dominated by Narenga porphyracorma and Themeda
   arundinacea grasslands were 1.7-3.2/km2. Annual monsoon floods were
   responsible for maintaining prime grazing habitat and high population
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored 381 radio-marked ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) on public
   and private woodlands in central Wisconsin during 1982-88 to determine
   seasonal mortality rates due to predation and hunting. A total of 222
   known mortalities were recorded:  159 from predation and 63 from
   hunting. Adult survival rates gradually decreased from 0.85 in summer to
   0.57 in winter, then increased in spring to 0.73. juvenile survival was
   also highest in summer (0.61), but remained relatively low through all
   seasons. Hunting mortality rates on public hunting areas were
   significantly (P < 0.005) higher than on private lands for both adults
   (0.73 vs. 0.13) and juveniles (0.56 vs. 0.09). In contrast, mortality
   (viz., predation) was similar during the nonhunting season on public and
   private lands for both adults (0.44 vs. 0.44) and juveniles (0.80 vs.
   0.77, respectively), suggesting that hunting mortality was at least
   partially, if not completely, additive to natural mortality. Immigration
   from private lands sustained grouse numbers on public lands because
   overall population densities gradually increased from 5.8 to 7.8
   drumming males per 100 ha during the 6-year study. We conclude that
   ruffed grouse numbers will be substantially reduced in areas with high
   hunting mortality and reduced immigration due to fragmented habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of representative biotopes, single species populations or
   biodiversity usually embraces two or more biotopes, and is often
   affected by surrounding croplands. The conclusions from landscape
   ecological studies can, therefore, offer important contributions to
   conservation, especially at early levels of landscape change or habitat
   fragmentation. Indicator and keystone species are useful for monitoring
   and managing fragmented biotopes, respectively. Communities as well as
   single species are affected by the juxtaposition of successional and
   climax biotopes, which influence climatic equability, seasonality,
   productivity and dispersal. Low levels of fragmentation may result in
   ill-functioning communities, and greater fragmentation may result in
   species losses and ultimately in the loss of whole communities.
   Fragmented habitats retain species with high reproductive and dispersal
   rates and generalized habitat selection. New combinations of interacting
   species will lead to trivialization of earlier habitat-specific
   interactions. Validation of these concepts was made with data from a
   Swedish research program on fragmented biotopes in production
   landscapes. General reserve selection and methods of management for
   preserving climax communities, single specialized species and high
   biodiversity are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas fluorescens strain Hv37aR2 and its isogenic Afu- mutants
   deficient in biosynthesis of an antifungal compound were used to examine
   the role of an antibiotic in the suppression in vivo of Pythium ultimum
   infection on cotton.  The results demonstrated that suppression of
   disease development is dominated by the biosynthesis of an
   antibiotic(s).  An average of 70\% of the reduction in root infection
   and an average of 50\% of the increase in emergence caused strain by
   Hv37aR2 was attributed to the biosynthesis of the antibiotic, oomycin A.
   Afu- strains colonized the spermosphere and rhizosphere of cotton as
   well as their parental strain, indicating that the Afu- phenotype did
   not compromise their colonization ability.  Seed treatment with strain
   Hv37aR2 resulted in the formation of significantly fewer Pythium
   propagules in the soil after root infection as compared to Afu- mutant
   strain WH103 and the nontreated control.  A population level of strain
   Hv37aR2 of 10(6) cfu per seed at planting was necessary to ensure
   protection from disease development caused by Pythium.  Expression in
   vivo of an operon required for antibiotic biosynthesis was determined
   using a lacZ gene (Tn3HoHo-1) transcriptional fusion.  Gene expression
   was monitored by measuring beta-galactosidase activity in strains
   growing on cotton seeds.  Enzyme activity was readily detectable in the
   parental strain at 24 h, yet barely detectable in the Afu- mutant
   strain.  These data demonstrate that the production of an antibiotic(s)
   in vitro was indirectly correlated with biosynthesis of the compound and
   biological control in vivo.}},

   and Wadden Sea sampling was conducted on board commercial shrimp vessels
   equipped with beam trawls. The Elbe river system was sampled on board a
   research boat equipped with a similar 3-m beam trawl. Density indices
   were calculated for the various areas. To estimate the importance of
   rivers as nursery areas for flounder, river surface area was compared to
   the area of tidal flats in the Wadden Sea.
   In all surveys, there was no relationship between fish densities and tow
   directions with respect to tide. In the Elbe river system flounder
   densities were not correlated to substrate types but increased
   significantly with decreasing salinity. Abundances were always lowest in
   polyhaline habitats and increased up to 10-fold in mesohaline estuarine
   areas. In the limnetic tidal sections of the Elbe river and its
   tributaries densities increased again by factors of 3 to 10. The
   succession of 1-group modal lengths from limnetic to polyhaline habitats
   demonstrated that smaller fish preferred less saline waters. 0-group
   specimens lagging behind in growth did not leave the limnetic river
   section in winter. The onset of the spawning migration in November was
   determined by monitoring the length-frequency distributions throughout
   the year.
   The possible sources of bias are discussed and gear efficiency is
   estimated from literature sources. The contribution of rivers to the 0-
   and 1-group flounder population on the tidal flats of the Wadden Sea is
   estimated at about 35.1\%.}},

Abstract = {{Moss tissue from two distinct populations of Sphagnum cuspidatum from N.
   Wales ('unpolluted') and the S. Pennines ('polluted') was exposed to 0.2
   mM HSO3- over a 24-26 h period.  The rates of HSO4- disapperance in the
   bathing solution were monitored in conjunction with tissue dark
   respiration, net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll a fluorescence
   induction kinetics.  Slow disappearance of HSO3- in the presence of moss
   tissue from N. Wales (40 \% of initial concentration remaining after 24
   h) resulted in a rapid (< 2 h) loss of photosynthetic oxygen evolution,
   and a gradual marked decline in tissue dark respiration and chlorophyll
   fluorescence quenching.  In the S. Pennine tissue, rapid HSO3-
   disappearance in the growth medium (complete after < 4 h) resulted in a
   marked recovery of photosynthetic and respiratory pathways after the
   initial inhibitory effects of HSO3- on these processes.  Pretreating S.
   Pennine moss tissue with EDTA prior to exposure increased HSO3-
   residence time with consequent rapid decline in net photosynthetic rate,
   rendering the response of the moss similar to that from N. Wales
   ('unpolluted' site).
   In a second experiment, identical moss samples from the two study sites
   were exposed to 0.2 mM HSO3- for a period of 24 d.  One set of plants
   from each population was prewashed in 5 mM EDTA to remove
   extracellularly-bound cations prior to HSO3- exposure.  Growth decrease
   was greater in the unpretreated moss from N. Wales (74 \% with respect
   to tissue not exposed to HSO3-) than that from the S. Pennines (45.5
   \%).  After 10 days the pigments of the former were visibly bleached. 
   No bleaching was observed in the latter.
   In the moss from N. Wales, removal of the extracellular cations with
   EDTA only slightly enhanced the effect of HSO3- on growth, whilst in the
   S. Pennine plants EDTA pretreatment resulted in a further growth
   reduction of 13 \%.
   The differential response of the moss from the two sites is discussed as
   a function of the extracellular transition metal concentration (notably
   Fe) associated with the plants.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of copper-resistant (Cu(r)) strains of Xanthomonas
   campestris pv. vesicatoria were monitored in the field on nonsymptomatic
   tomato leaflets treated with copper or with a copper and mancozeb
   mixture over three and four seasons, respectively.  Copper and a
   combination of copper and mancozeb reduced epiphytic populations of X.
   c. vesicatoria, compared to those in the untreated control.  Populations
   of X. c. vesicatoria on leaflets receiving copper and the
   copper-mancozeb combination differed significantly in only one of three
   seasons.  A positive correlation was observed between epiphytic
   populations and disease severity.  In a greenhouse study, where a Cu(r)
   strain of X. c. vesicatoria was applied to tomato foliage, bacterial
   populations were significantly less on plants treated with copper or
   with a copper and mancozeb mixture than on untreated plants.  However,
   leaflets treated with the copper and mancozeb combination had
   significantly lower Cu(r) populations than leaflets treated with copper
   alone.  In another study, where a Cu(r) and copper-sensitive (Cu(s))
   strain were separately inoculated on treated plants, disease severity
   was significantly reduced by both copper treatments compared to that of
   the control.  However, there were no significant differences in disease
   severity between the two copper treatments when plants were inoculated
   with either a Cu(r) or Cu(s) strain.  Ionic and total soluble copper in
   dew collected from bactericide-treated leaves were not significantly
   different between the two copper treatments.  Although ionic and soluble
   copper may be factors in toxicity to Cu(r) strains, they do not appear
   to be the primary components involved in the toxicity of the copper and
   mancozeb mixture to Cu(r) strains of X. c. vesicatoria.}},

Abstract = {{An ability to detect maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) infections will
   help explain how MDM epidemics develop.  Trap plant plots with and
   without diseased source plants, successive maize plantings, and grass
   weeds in tile plots were used to monitor MDM onset in northern Ohio. 
   This area is outside the natural distribution of johnsongrass (Sorghum
   halepense), the overwintering host of MDMV-A.  The average incidence of
   MDM in trap plants increased from 44 to 52\% as the number of source
   plants placed at a 0.6-m distance from the trap plants increased from 25
   to 100 plants.  At a constant level of 100 source plants, the average
   incidence of MDM decreased from 52 to 33\% as the distance between
   source plants and trap plants increased from 0.6 to 4.9 m.  The decrease
   in MDM incidence averaged -4.8\%/m of the distance from source plants
   and averaged + 0.5\% MDM for each unit increase in source plants. 
   Successive plantings at location 2 detected MDM onset 42 and 12 days
   earlier in 1986 and 1987, respectively, than did the trap plant plots
   without source plants.  MDMV was not detected in 832 weed samples
   collected from the field or in the six grass weed hosts grown in tile
   plots.  Aphid populations were monitored with yellow-pan water traps. 
   Rhopalosiphum maidis was significantly related to MDM onset.  Aphid
   migration, seed transmission, and infected weed host hypotheses were
   evaluated as initial sources of MDMV.  The weed host hypothesis best
   explained MDM onsets in northern Ohio.}},

Abstract = {{Development of anthracnose, incited by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides,
   was examined over three summer seasons in pure and mixed stands of the
   tropical pasture legume Stylosanthes scabra.  Three accessions and two
   cultivars with different levels of resistance to four races of the
   pathogen were used.  The susceptible cultivar Fitzroy was either
   excluded or included in increasing proportions in four different
   mixtures.  Significant reduction in the area under the disease progress
   curve (AUDPC) in mixtures over the pure stand of the components occurred
   only in certain mixtures in some years.  In the absence of Fitzroy,
   AUDPC in mixture was lower than the arithmetic mean of AUDPC of the
   components in pure stands in only one of the three growing seasons.  In
   the mixture containing equal proportions of all components including
   Fitzroy, AUDPC was similar to the mean of pure stands in all 3 yr.  In
   mixtures with more than 50\% Fitzroy, AUDPC was significantly less in 2
   of the 3 yr.  There was no improvement in the survival of plants of
   individual accessions in mixtures compared with that in pure stands.  In
   general, Fitzroy had consistently less AUDPC in mixtures with more than
   50\% Fitzroy than in its pure stand, by contrast, AUDPC of the more
   resistant accessions did not differ significantly from their respective
   pure stands in any year.  Severity of individual accessions did not
   increase significantly with increasing Fitzroy content of a mixture
   except for Seca and Fitzroy in 1988 and 1989, respectively.  The study
   emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring of host and pathogen
   populations in perennial pastures to ascertain the role of genotype
   mixtures in restricting anthracnose.}},

Abstract = {{Carex polymorpha is a rare sedge of eastern North America, currently a
   candidate for Federal listing.  Populations in Maine and Massachusetts
   were studied to establish a scientific basis for population monitoring,
   management, and protection.  We examined potential and actual fecundity,
   and used pollination experiments to test hypotheses regarding breeding
   systems.  Sexual reproductive characters were compared with the common
   species, C. vestita.  Studies of vegetative reproduction of C.
   polymorphia included determination of rhizome growth patterns, above-
   and below-ground biomass, organ dimensions and dynamics of shoots in
   permanent plots.
   Both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction appear to be correlated
   with canopy closure.  Numbers of flowering shoots, flowers and seeds
   appear to be limited by light availability.  Both the number of achenes
   and the percent seed set per flowering shoot are similar in Carex
   polymorpha and C. vestita.  Density of vegetative shoots and of leaf and
   rhizome sizes are also correlated with canopy cover:  biomass production
   appears to be limited by light levels.  Shoot dynamics are correlated
   with light and microhabitat type.  The least stable shoot populations
   are in disturbed, open sand sites, while shoot populations in
   undisturbed, open canopy sites have high turnover rates but stable
   sizes.  These results suggest that canopy management may be critical to
   maintenance of vegetative and sexual reproduction in established
   populations of Carex polymorpha.}},

Abstract = {{Harvest data constitute an important source of information on many
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations in North America.
   Many techniques and variations thereof have been developed for the
   analysis of such data, and preferred methods differ widely among
   management agencies and researchers.  In this monograph, we catalog,
   evaluate, and compare a number of these techniques including
   Index-Removal, Catch Per Unit Effort, Population Reconstruction,
   Change-in-ratio, Life Table, Harvest Age Structure, Harvest Sex Ratio,
   Lang and Wood's ``Pennsylvania{''} method, and Fraser's method.  We
   critically examined characteristics such as input requirements, output
   produced, assumptions, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and robustness.
   Comparative evaluations were based primarily on ability to identify and
   monitor trends in the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge deer herd
   during the period 1973-88.  Over that timespan, the herd was apparently
   harvest-regulated and experienced several alternating periods of decline
   and stability.
   Index-Removal, Change-in-ratio, and Life Table Analysis proved least
   satisfactory in providing information about the reference herd,
   primarily because critical assumptions were not met.  Harvest Age
   Structure and Harvest Sex Ratio analyses were more useful, but neither
   provided information sufficient for precise herd management.  The
   importance of interpreting harvest age structure separately for males
   and females was emphasized.  Reconstruction offered a logical and direct
   tool for population analysis although it was sensitive to varying
   harvest intensity and did not address current status unless combined
   with other techniques.  Certain variations of the Catch Per Unit Effort
   approach were able to closely monitor trends in abundance with a minimum
   of data.  The Lang-Wood and Fraser methods appeared to be less
   sensitive, precise, and robust than Reconstruction or Catch Per Unit
   Effort, but could serve as supplemental methods of analysis.
   We conclude by describing how trends in abundance, harvest, and effort
   might be indicative of a population's probable position on the growth
   curve.  The relevance of such knowledge to ``practical{''} deer
   management also is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Information on condition, growth and reproduction was collected from a
   sample of 155 female lechwe in the Linyanti Swamp, northern Botswana. 
   Condition varied significantly with age, reproductive state and season
   and indications were found of relationships between body mass and the
   attainment of puberty in young females and body mass and the fertility
   of adult females.  There were also indications that the population was
   under nutritional stress because of high water levels and that this had
   caused reductions in the growth rate and fertility of young females.
   It is suggested that the sensitivity of young females to adverse
   environmental conditions could be exploited to optimize population
   monitoring for conservation purposes by using them as an indicator
   class, rather than monitoring the entire population.  Because of
   relationships between condition, growth and reproduction, it is also
   suggested that long-term monitoring of condition should form part of any
   effort to understand population dynamics.}},

   (E,Z)-2,13-ODDA] or (Z,Z)-3,13-octadecadien-1 ol acetate {[}called
   (Z,Z)-3,13-ODDA; the main component of the peachtree borer, Synanthedon
   exitiosa (Say), sex pheromone and mating disruption dispenser] was
   released into the air from Shin-Etsu ropes (254 per hectare {[}100 per
   acre]) in whole bunch grape vineyards and compared with untreated
   vineyards using a randomized block design (four replicates). Pherocon IC
   traps baited with a 99:1 blend of (E,Z)-2,13-ODDA:(Z,Z)-3,13-ODDA were
   used to monitor the seasonal number of grape root borer males, Vitacea
   polistiformis (Harris). These trap captures were significantly reduced
   by 99.1 and 87.5\% in the vineyards treated with (E,Z)-2,13-ODDA and
   (Z,Z)-3,13-ODDA, respectively, compared with the untreated vineyard mean
   capture of 134.0 males. The (Z,Z)-3,13-ODDA-treated vineyards realized a
   mean grape root borer pupal skin reduction of 92.7\% over a 2-yr period
   (life cycle), which was significantly different than the mean count from
   the untreated vineyards (17.2\% increase). The mean pupal skin count
   reduction of 65.7\% from the (E,Z)-3,13-ODDA-treated vineyards was not
   significantly different from either the (Z,Z)-3,13-ODDA-treated or
   untreated vineyards. This lower mean reduction was attributed to only
   one (E,Z)-2,13-ODDA-treated vineyard that probably experienced
   immigration of mated feral females from an untreated vineyard 200 m to
   the southwest. It appears that placement of 254 ties per hectare per
   season of either compound alone in isolated vineyards with a low to
   moderate population of grape root borers may be an effective and
   environmentally safe alternative to insecticide treatments for control
   of the grape root borer.}},

Abstract = {{Trap captures and species-specific responses (trap specificity) with
   four different blends composed of four components of synthetic western
   obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) (Lepidoptera:
   Tortricidae) sex phermone were assessed in British Columbia, using
   seasonal trap catchers of obliquebanded leafroller and the ratio of
   obliquebanded leafroller to Archips rosanus (L.) (Lepidoptera: 
   Torticidae).  A four-component blend containing Z11-14:0Ac, E11-14:0Ac,
   Z11-14:ALD, and Z11-14:OH in a 100:2:1:0.75 ratio captured the greatest
   number of obliquebanded leafrollers and had a degree of trap
   specificity.  In addition, differences in trap captures and the degree
   of trap specificity also were assessed for eastern (Quebec) and western
   (British Columbia) populations of obliquebanded leafroller.  Comparisons
   were made using three different blends composed of either three or four
   components of the obliquebanded leafroller sex pheromone with the ratios
   100:2:1:1.5, 100:5:0:5, and 100:2.5:0:2.5 of Z11-14:0Ac, E11-14:0Ac,
   Z11-14:ALD, and Z11-14:OH.  In British Columbia, the four-component
   blend (100:2:1:1.5) captured the greatest number of obliquebanded
   leafrollers and had a high degree of trap specificity.  In Quebec, no
   differences in trap captures among the blends were observed.  These
   results suggest that qualitative differences may exist between the sex
   pheromone of eastern and western populations of obliquebanded leafroller
   and indicate the need for considering regional differences when
   monitoring obliquebanded leafroller with commercial synthetic pheromone
   blends.}},

Abstract = {{Bench-scale biotreatability studies were performed to evaluate the
   potential for using a solid-phase bioremediation process to ameliorate
   pentachlorophenol- (PCP-) and creosote-contaminated sediment and surface
   soil present at the American Creosote Works Superfund site, Pensacola,
   FL.  The effects of tilling and fertilization on the rate and extent of
   biodegradation of PCP and 42 targeted creosote constituents by
   indigenous microflora were monitored by gas chromatographic analysis of
   organic extracts of soil and sediment; changes in microbial populations
   were also recorded.  Specially designed ``landfarming chambers{''}
   allowed for the quantitative analysis of targeted pollutants lost
   through abiotic processes.  In general, solid-phase bioremediation
   resulted in slow and predictable losses of targeted pollutants (i.e.,
   low molecular weight creosote constitutents were more readily
   biodegraded than higher molecular weight contaminants), and the more
   recalcitrant pollutants (e.g., PCP) tended to persist.  Performance data
   from these studies suggest that full-scale site remediation employing
   solid-phase bioremediation strategies may not effectively meet
   acceptable treatment standards in the time defining these studies (90
   days).}},

   colonies was monitored for 16 months with no outside source of

   based on collection of debris, samples of bees and brood, and estimates
   of number of bees and broodcells during the summer.  In the winter, only
   dead bees and debris were collected.  Samples were taken at 3-week
   intervals.  Data indicated that the mite population probably could
   increase more than 100 times within one summer, and more than ten times
   between years, in a climate with a brood-rearing period of less than
   five months.  A large variation in mite population increase existed
   between colonies.  The winter mortality of mites that die with the host
   or drop from the winter cluster has a large influence on the population
   dynamics of the mite.  Data also indicated that the simple method of
   counting mites in hive debris is a useful parameter for monitoring the
   population development of Varroa in colonies with hatching brood.}},

   4.  The drift of parasitized G. pulex was significantly greater than
   unparasitized animals.  Gammarids harbouring only one parasite were
   found in significantly higher proportions in the drift than those with
   two or more parasites.
   5.  At both sites (margin and mid-river) the proportion of unparasitized

Abstract = {{At the National Committee for Research and Development of Nuclear Energy
   and Alternate Energy Sources (ENEA) Center of Frascati, there are
   several radiation-producing machines: two tokamaks and three electron
   accelerators; moreover, a neutron generator will begin to operate in a
   short time. A completely automatic monitoring system has been developed.
   Radiation control is performed by means of classical active and passive
   detectors. An automatic acquisition system has been developed: Measured
   quantities are acquired and stored in a specific data base; information
   regarding radioactivity levels, machines status, personnel dosimetry and
   meteorological parameters are available in real time. If any of the
   radiometric quantities exceeds appropriate reference levels, the
   following operations automatically activate: An automatic switch turns
   off the machines and an alarm signal is broadcast to the Health Physics
   group. In addition, the ``Nuclear Emergency{''} software module starts
   if a radionuclide emission is detected. This module has been implemented
   to provide response to radiological emergencies in the ENEA nuclear
   research centers. The modularity of the computer-based system allows its
   utilization also in other nuclear centers, such as at nuclear power
   plants. When activated, the ``Nuclear Emergency{''} displays an alarm
   signal and informs the Health Physics group about the monitor's location
   and characteristics and the measured data exceeding the reference level.
   If emission of radionuclides occurs, a preliminary evaluation of their
   diffusion in the atmosphere and an estimation of the population dose are
   performed. Statistical analysis of the event is also possible.}},

   months, monitoring survival, fecundity, seedling appearance and the seed

   strongly affected seed output but had no effect on the survival of
   juveniles and vegetative adults. Vegetative plants provide an important
   population reserve of dormant buds. (3) Grazing diminished fecundity by
   reducing plant resources; this effect was greater when grazing was
   unrestricted. Under controlled grazing, the reduction in fecundity was
   correlated with an increase in the survival of individuals, relative to
   free grazing and no grazing. (4) The population dynamics of A.

Abstract = {{(1) Rumex acetosella is a dioecious perennial species which reproduces
   both by seeds and by adventitious shoots. The progression of the floral
   sex ratio was monitored for four years in experimental populations grown
   from seeds collected from five abandoned fields located south of Paris,
   France. At each census, all ramets in flower were scored for sex type.
   (2) In the first year, sex ratios were balanced, or slightly female
   biased. In the second year, sex ratios were seen to vary quite widely,
   depending on census date, population and also on the replicate sample
   within the population. In the third and fourth years male ramets greatly
   outnumbered females. Thus in the long term, male ramets showed greater
   clonal growth, i.e. recovered better than females following the repeated
   energetic cost of sexual reproduction. (3) The results of the present
   study suggest the importance of examining the age and past history of a
   population, as the relative contributions of sexual vs. vegetative
   reproduction may lead to different sex ratios depending on the time of
   establishment of the population.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Two contrasting morphs of Brachypodium sylvaticum which can be
   distinguished by the presence or absence of spreading macro-hairs at the
   leaf margins, termed hairy-edge (HE) and non-hairy-edge (NHE), are
   described. The two morphs differ in their field distribution in respect
   of vegetational shade; the NHE morph is confined to shaded sites,
   whereas the HE morph is found in both open and shaded habitats but is
   generally the less-frequent morph in shaded conditions. (2) Plants of
   the two morphs were transplanted into a deciduous woodland and into an
   adjacent unshaded grassland and their survival and growth monitored over
   a 27-month period. (3) At the woodland site 77\% of the NHE transplants
   survived to 27 months compared with 45\% of the HE plants. In contrast,
   at the unshaded site, 90\% of the HE plants survived to 27 months
   compared with 60\% of the NHE plants. (4) There were large differences
   in a number of measures of growth between the two morphs at each site.
   The NHE morph grew better at the shaded site whilst the HE morph grew
   better at the unshaded site. The NHE morph allocated a greater
   proportion of the above-ground dry matter to reproductive tillers than
   the HE morph at both sites. (5) The fitness of the `alien morph' at each
   site (HE in the shaded site; NHE in the open site) was calculated
   relative to that of the `native morph'. The relative fitness of the
   alien morph declined with time for survival and tiller number and was
   also low for characters measured at the final harvest. The values
   indicate that strong selection pressures operate against the HE morph in
   shaded habitats and against the NHE morph in unshaded habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Nocturnal activity of adult Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Heliothis
   virescens (F.) was monitored in cotton, from the pinhead square to open
   boll stage, in the Delta region of Mississippi. Samples were taken at
   hourly intervals by hand capture and pheromone traps and through the
   night by ultraviolet blacklight traps and compared with egg counts
   obtained from whole-plant inspection made the following day. H.
   virescens was the dominant species in all sampling (> 80\% of all
   trapped males, > 98\% of all hand captured adults, and > 98\% of all egg
   counts), with the exception of blacklight traps (33\% of all adults
   trapped). Low average adult fat body ratings (< 2) and low average
   number of spermatophores in females, together with low oviposition
   rates, indicate that H. zea was not a predominant resident during the
   sampling period (generations F2-F4). For H. virescens, hand captures of
   both males and females were highly correlated with egg counts (r =
   0.8888; P < 0.0001). Correlation between H. virescens moths caught in
   pheromone traps and those caught by hand (and egg counts) were highest
   when the number caught in traps was compared with the number caught by
   hand 4 d previously (r = 0.5800, P < 0.0001). No association was found
   between captures in blacklight traps and captures by hand (or egg
   counts) for either species. Over 70\% of all H. virescens caught by
   pheromone traps occurred after midnight, 64\% of all H. virescens
   females caught by hand occurred before midnight, and hand-captured males
   were nearly equally divided before and after midnight. Over the season,
   during each generation, trapped and hand-captured males showed a
   tendency to reach peak numbers in later intervals. For both sexes,
   movement was most frequently observed during early intervals (2000-2300
   hours CDST), with a lull in activity around midnight, followed by a high
   frequency of mating during later intervals (0100-0300 hours). The
   highest frequency of mating females was found during the sixth interval
   (0145-0245 hours), coincident with a dip in trap capture frequency. Trap
   capture frequency rose to a second peak during interval 7 (0300-0400
   hours), coincident with the highest frequency of mating males. The
   consistency of the observed nocturnal patterns (in-field and trap),
   together with other studies showing similar results, lead to the
   conclusion that knowledge of nightly temporal frequency of trap captures
   may provide critical information for more accurate prediction of field
   population development than is currently possible with daily summary
   trap data alone.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of feral American mink Mustela vison were investigated in
   several study areas in Ireland, principally by capture-recapture
   techniques.  The populations were found to be essentially
   self-regulating, with stress, weight loss and mortality evident during
   the winter and spring.  The highest mean density recorded, in terms of
   animals per unit length of river or lake shore, was 1.4 individuals km-1
   with a peak density of 2.3 individuals km-1, but population densities
   were considerbly lower in most areas.  Trappability and population
   structure, in age, sex and residency classes, varied between habitats,
   but population turnover was high, leading to complete replacement of
   individuals in two populations monitored for two years.  The
   availability of the preferred prey, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes
   appeared to be a major factor determining population size and preferred
   breeding areas.  Control methods are either unnecessary or are likely to
   fail in most situations, and may be counterproductive.}},

Abstract = {{Epiphytic populations of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria were
   monitored weekly on tomato plants supplied through drip irrigation with
   combinations of two rates of NH4NO3 and three rates of KCl.  Bacterial
   populations and the percentage of defoliation were then related, through
   a repeated measures analysis of variance, to fertilization and soil
   salinity and also were correlated with the mineral content of leaves. 
   Lower epiphytic populations of the pathogen developed on plants
   receiving combinations of the higher rates of nitrogen and potassium; an
   interaction between the two fertilizers was significant (P = 0.01) in
   each of three seasons.  Defoliation was more severe at the low rate of
   nitrogen application, but the rate of potassium application had little
   influence.  Epiphytic populations of X. c. vesicatoria, but not the
   severity of defoliation, also were associated with increases in soil
   salinity that resulted from high rates of fertilization.  Applications
   of NH4NO3 increased the concentration of nitrogen in leaves throughout
   the season, and applications of KCl similarly increased foliar
   concentrations of potassium.  Through fruit set, however, increased
   application of NH4NO3 reduced potassium concentrations while greater
   applications of KCl reduced nitrogen concentrations in leaves.  Although
   a higher rate of NH4NO3 also reduced the foliar concentrations of
   calcium and magnesium, magnesium but not calcium was affected by the
   rate of KCl.  Early in the season, epiphytic populations of X. c.
   vesicartoria were inversely correlated with the foliar concentration of
   potassium; at harvest, however, populations were inversely related to
   magnesium content.  Defoliation increased significantly with increasing
   concentrations of both magnesium and calcium.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria were monitored
   over four seasons on leaves of two tomato cultivars and five genotypes
   selected for various levels of resistance to the pathogen.  Populations
   on all five genotypes were consistently below those on the very
   susceptible Lyconorma, but only those on Hawaii 7998 were significantly
   below numbers of the susceptible cultivar Walter in every test. 
   Rankings of cultigens based on support of epiphytic populations of X. c.
   pv. vesicatoria mirrored those based on defoliation over two seasons. 
   Significant interactions in repeated measures analyses of variance
   between cultigen and sampling day indicated differences in population
   and disease development over time.  By analyzing the slopes of
   regression equations, which compared epiphytic populations or
   defoliation with time, population and disease development were confirmed
   to be slowest on leaves of the genotypes Campbell 28, Ohio 4013, and

Abstract = {{We analyzed population trends of 26 species of North American migratory
   landbirds using 53 years of spring migration count data collected in
   eastern Massachusetts from 1937 to 1989, inclusive.  These data span
   twice the time period of most landbird monitoring data sets, allowing us
   to examine how accurately trends based on shorter-term investigations of
   population trends represent longer ones.  We found that 18 species
   (64\%) have declined significantly, three species (12\%) have increased
   significantly, and five species (19\%) have shown no trend over this
   time period.  Using the most recent ten years of our data, the trend
   matched that of the full 53-year data set for 10 species (38\%).  Using
   the most recent 20 years of data, the number of matching trends
   increased to 18 (69\%).  Using a 30-year subset of data did not improve
   the percentage of matching trends and showed a greater number of
   non-significant trends than did analysis of the most recent 20-year
   subset of data.  This pattern resulted because many species appeared to
   be at low population levels in the 1950s and early 1960s, before the
   time when most current avian censuses and surveys began.  Our results
   indicate that many species are in fact declining, but that declines in
   the past 20 years might be partly a result of normal, short-term
   population fluctuations.}},

   clay and sand at temperature 5, 10, 15, 30 and 35-degrees-C, moisture
   levels 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100\% of water holding capacity (WHC) of
   the soils and aerobic and anaerobic conditions was monitored at 7-day
   intervals on GRANADA and SEQUEIRA'S (1981) medium.  The maximum decline
   was at 35-degrees-C and 5-degrees-C, anaerobic conditions and dry soil. 
   Among the soil moistures, the decline was lowest at 60\% WHC followed by
   20-40\% WHC and 80-100\% WHC.  Clay soil harboured the pathogen longer
   than sand.  At 30-degrees-C, both the races reached nondetectable levels
   in 3 weeks in dry sand and 4-6 weeks in dry clay.  In wet soil (60\%
   WHC), the pathogen perished in 8-10 weeks at 35-degrees-C and 12 weeks
   at 5-degrees-C.  The rate of population decline was the same for both
   the isolates at temperatures below 15-degrees-C but at higher
   temperatures it was lower for race 1 than race 3.  Under anaerobic
   conditions in wet sandy soil (60\% WHC), the pathogen was not detected
   after 6 weeks.  The decline rate of race 1 isolate under the most
   congenial conditions, i.e., clay soil at 60\% (WHC) moisture and
   15-degrees-C was log No. 0.33.  The rate of decline would bring down the
   population of 5.0 x 10(9)CFU/g soil to nil in 29 weeks.  Therefore, the
   long term survival of the pathogen in soil devoid of host debris may not
   be feasible.
   The rate of shift from virulent to avirulent population in vitro was
   greater at high (35-degrees-C and above) and low (5-degrees-C)
   temperatures, low pH (4.5) and anaerobic conditions.  Race 3 isolate
   lost virulence rapidly at high pH (8.6) also.  The pathogen maintained
   its virulence best in soil at 10-degrees-C and 20-40\% of water holding
   capacity moisture.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring established field populations of an introduced French strain
   of Longitarsus flavicornis in Tasmania in 1985/86 showed that
   newly-emerged adults were first recorded in early December, with peak
   emergences occurring in January.  Oviposition commenced in January,
   first instar larvae were recorded from mid-February and the first pupae
   were collected in early November.  Laboratory studies suggested that
   eggs laid in the field in late autumn may not hatch until the following
   spring.  Evidence is presented that prevailing weather conditions may
   have initially restricted establishment and spread of L. flavicornis in
   some areas.  Ragwort density was reduced at 2 monitored sites where L.
   flavicornis was established.  Ragwort populations, which initially
   consisted of plants with both single and multi-crowns, and shoots from a
   range of size and development classes, were replaced by populations
   dominated by plants with single crowns and small rosettes.  These
   observations indicate that L. flavicornis can be effective in
   controlling ragwort.}},

Abstract = {{Adult citrus psylla populations were monitored in commercial citrus
   orchards.  Most psylla were trapped in the northern and southern edge
   rows.  It is recommended that populations are monitored with one yellow
   sticky trap placed in the most northern, one in the most southern and
   one in the central row of citrus orchards.  This will provide for
   standardised and reliable monitoring.  There was continuous movement of
   citrus psylla between unsprayed citrus orchard and adjacent indigenous
   vegetation, indicating that numbers of citrus psylla may be higher in
   areas where indigenous host plants grow near citrus.  Parasitism of
   psylla nymphs on indigenous host plants was low during the months June
   to November when psylla breeding on citrus is at its highest. 
   Therefore, movement of psylla parasitoids from indigenous host plants to
   citrus seem to be of little value and the removal of indigenous host
   plants is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of benthic invertebrates in subarctic Southern Indian Lake,
   Manitoba, before and after manipulation of the lake for hydroelectric
   development, revealed that Hexagenia (Insecta:  Ephemeroptera)
   populations collapsed following the diversion phase.  Initial
   conclusions attributed the collapse to lake manipulation, but intensive
   life-history studies indicated that the cause was a series of cold years
   immediately following diversion.  A simple model relating air
   temperature during the open-water season to Hexagenia abundance was
   successful in predicting burrowing mayfly abundance in the lake.  This
   indicated the significance of temperature in regulating these
   populations, which are near their northern limits of distribution in
   Manitoba.  The difficulty in discriminating between natural ecosystem
   variability and anthropogenic effects during the course of an
   environmental monitoring program is illustrated by this study.}},

   consists of (Z)-11-hexadecenal, (Z)-13-octadecenal and (Z)-9-hexadecenal
   (48:6:5; total 0.6 mg per rubber septum) was used as lure.  Trap types
   (water-trap and sticky-trap), trap heights (0.5 m and 1 m above the
   ground) and trap locations (inside and at the boundary of paddy fields)
   were analysed and trap catches of males were counted over two flight
   seasons for two years in the southern part of Okayama Prefecture,
   western Honshu triple-over-dot, Japan.  In the first flight season, the
   trap catches were significantly greater at trap heights of 0.5 m than at
   1.0 m, at field boundaries than in field centers and in water-traps than
   in sticky-traps, respectively.  In contrast, the second flight season's
   trap catches were not significantly different between trap heights,
   locations and types.  Peak times of trap catch in each season were not
   affected by these trapping variables.  Seasonal patterns in trap catches
   inside paddy fields and at field boundaries were remarkably different. 
   In the latter, numbers of males trapped in the first flight season were
   much greater than those in the former.  Sticky traps set at 0.5 m above
   the ground of the boundary are adequate for population monitoring

   antipredator behavior following repeated contact with the flicking
   tongue of a predatory snake.  In a given trial, a salamander was
   contacted ten times by the snake and within-trial escalation or
   reduction in response was monitored.  For each salamander, trials were
   repeated 6 times at 21-day intervals to test for long-term changes in
   response threshold and extent of escalation, and to identify consistent
   differences in behavior among individuals.  The salamanders were found
   to escalate their antipredator responses over the ten stimuli within
   trials.  They were significantly more responsive to tongue contacts late
   in a given trial than to the initial stimuli.  They also showed
   long-term, among-trial decreases in the threshold to initial response
   and increases in the mean responses to the first tongue contacts. 
   However, there was no significant long-term change in maximum response
   threshold or in the mean responses to the final tongue contacts. 
   Variation among individuals in thresholds and responses was considerable

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the genetic consequences of aquaculture on natural
   fish populations. The study is motivated by rapidly increasing numbers
   of intentionally and accidentally released fish and is based on
   empirical observations reported in the literature. A wide variety of
   outcomes, ranging from no detectable effect to complete introgression or
   displacement, has been observed following releases of cultured fish into
   natural settings. Where genetic effects on performance traits have been
   documented, they always appear to be negative in comparison with the
   unaffected native populations. These findings are consistent with
   theoretical considerations of the implications of elevated levels of
   gene flow between cultured and locally adapted natural populations; they
   raise concerns over the genetic future of many natural populations in
   the light of increasing numbers of released fish. Strategies for the
   genetic protection of native populations from the effects of aquaculture
   are outlined including more secure containment, the use of sterilized
   fish, and modifying the points of rearing and release. We recommend
   strong restrictions on gene flow from cultured to wild populations and
   effective monitoring of such gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{1.  Males and females of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.), a serious pest of
   coconut palms, congregate in decaying coconut trunks to mate, oviposit
   and prepare the wood for the young larvae.  A baculovirus disease is
   often transmitted from beetle to beetle in this environment and
   transmission to and from larvae probably also occurs.
   2.  Young beetles are mainly found feeding on palms, where they also
   frequently contract the virus disease, presumably through mating with
   diseased partners.
   3.  Monitoring beetle populations in the Philippines with attractant
   traps and by collections from palms showed seasonal fluctuations which
   were often inversely correlated with the incidence of the virus disease.
   Disease prevalence matched closely the proportion of females in the
   population.  Possible explanations for this correlation and for the
   seasonality of the disease prevalence are outlined.}},

   overall effectiveness was studied in brassica crops by painting black
   different parts of fluorescent-yellow water-traps.  Three pest species,
   Delia radicum (L.), D. platura (Meig.), and Meligethes aeneus
   (Fab.)/Meligethes viridescens (Fab.), together with blowflies and
   syrphids, were caught in large numbers.  Each insect responded
   differently to the yellow/black traps.  The numbers of insect caught
   indicated that the area of trap involved in capturing D. radicum was
   effectively twice the surface area of the water.  Yellow traps for
   monitoring D. radicum populations could be made more selective by
   painting the inner wall black, as such traps caught similar numbers of
   D. radicum to all-yellow traps but 50\% fewer D. platura, Meligethes sp.
   and blowflies, and 95\% fewer syrphids.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly collections of clown goby, Microgobius gulosus, were made from
   March 1984 through February 1985 at two stations located at the head of
   the Banana River, Brevard County, Florida, as part of the long-term
   environmental monitoring program at the John F. Kennedy Space Center.  A
   total of 18921 fishes comprising eight families and 12 genera was
   collected.  M. gulosus represented 6.4\% of the total catch. 
   Populations of M. gulosus exhibited aggregation behavior, which varied
   in intensity depending on densities of individuals m-2 and habitat
   characteristics.  Capture data were best described by the negative
   binomial distribution.  Mean estimates of individuals m-2 ranged from
   0.0 to a high of 22.1 during periods of peak recruitment.  The total
   length-weight regression for all individuals measured was log10 weight =
   -4.65 + 2.72 log10 length.  M. gulosus obtained a size of 35-40 mm TL
   the first year and 50-60 mm TL the second year.  Total lengths of all
   specimens ranged from 11 to 71 mm.  Young of the year first appeared in
   May with smallest individuals collected in June and July.  A protracted
   spawning period was observed.  Stomach and gut analyses revealed that
   crustaceans and annelids combined represented 65\% and 66\% of the total
   diet for M. gulosus from stations 1 (open) and 2 (impounded),
   respectively.  However, differences in proportions of the two groups
   were present between the two stations.  Crustaceans represented 47.1\%
   of the diet for gobies collected at station 1 and annelids 40.8\% for
   specimens collected from station 2.  Fecundity was low with the mean
   number of ova being 305 +/- 77.5 for females between 35 and 49 mm TL. 
   Estimated mortality rate was approximately 95\% annually.}},

Abstract = {{The Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans conducts annual bottom
   trawl surveys to monitor changes in the abundance of the major
   commercially important groundfish populations. Some of these survey have
   been in operation for almost 20 yr. The estimates from these surveys
   often indicate rapid changes in abundance over time beyond that expected
   from the population dynamics of the fish. Much of this interannual
   change has been interpreted as variation, the magnitude of which has
   often made it difficult to measure anything but the most severe effects
   of fishing, pollution or any other intervention on the population.
   Recent studies have shown that some of this variation may be attributed
   to changes in catchability of fish due to the effects of environmental
   variables on fish distribution. Annual changes in abundance as estimated
   from such field surveys may be confounded by changes in catchability due
   to annual changes in environmental conditions. In this study, trawl
   catches of age 4 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) from surveys conducted
   during March 1979-1988 were compared with concurrent measurements of
   bottom salinity, temperature and depth. Large catches of age 4 cod are
   more likely to occur in water characterized as the intermediate cold
   layer defined by salinities of 32-33.5 and temperatures < 5-degrees-C.
   This relationship also appears to be modified by depth. We further show
   that interannual changes in the estimated abundance from the surveys
   were, in a number of cases, coincident with changes in the proportion of
   the bottom water composed of the intermediate cold water layer. The
   implications that these patterns may have on interpreting trends in the
   estimates of abundance from trawl surveys are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient O3 exposures have reduced growth rates of tree genotypes in some
   areas of the United States.  For characterizing O3 exposures in forested
   areas, data from primarily population-oriented sites have been used.  It
   has been speculated that exposures calculated from population-oriented
   sites provide estimates greater than those that would actually be
   experienced in the majority of forested areas.  Accordingly, we compared
   1988 O3 data from three remote forested sites with data from several
   population-oriented monitoring sites in and around the mid- and southern
   Appalachian Mountains.  The number of hours greater-than-or-equal-to
   0.08 ppm was lower at the remote forested sites than at the nearby
   population-oriented locations.  In addition, we characterized the
   temporal variability of O3 exposures in forested regions of the United
   States and Canada for the period 1978-1988.  We found that the years of
   highest O3 exposure in the eastern United States during 1978-1988 were
   1978, 1980, 1983, and 1988, with 1988 being the worst year in four of
   seven eastern forest regions.  In 1988, the Whiteface Mountain summit
   site (1483 m) experienced approximately 10 percent more hourly average
   concentrations greater-than-or-equal-to 0.08 ppm than in the second
   highest O3 exposure year (i.e., 1979).  Consistently throughout the
   11-year period, the highest O3 exposures at the Whiteface Mountain site
   occurred during the late evening and early morning hours, with the
   result that the long-term 7-h (0900-1559h) exposure index could not
   distinguish those years in which the highest exposures occurred from
   those in which the lowest occurred.  Similar to the Whiteface Mountain
   site, two high-elevation Shenandoah National Park sites experienced
   their highest O3 exposures in 1988.  With the exception of 1986, the
   lower elevation site (Dickey Ridge) consistently experienced more
   frequent occurrences of hourly average concentrations
   greater-than-or-equal-to 0.08 ppm than the higher elevation site (Big
   Meadows).}},

Abstract = {{Spawning and recruitment periodicity and post-recruitment mortality were
   investigated in the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum on fringing
   reefs on the west coast of Barbados by direct census and by otolith
   dating techniques. Spawning was seasonal, occurring primarily between
   January and August. Recruitment was seasonal, and was significantly
   correlated with spawning with time lags of 1 and 2 mo. This is
   consistent with the 45 d (range 33 to 64 d) larval life of T.
   bifasciatum, and suggests that seasonal variation in spawning is the
   principal factor driving seasonal variation in recruitment. Spawning
   frequency was higher around new and full moons (spring tides) than
   around first and last quarters (neap tides), but recruitment did not
   differ significantly with lunar phase. Daily spawning was more frequent
   during ebb tides than flood tides, with peak spawning occurring near the
   beginning of ebb tide. Surface currents on the study reefs were offshore
   on 96 \% of the 94 occasions monitored, regardless of tidal phase.
   Surface currents at ebb tide were faster than at flood tide, and ebb
   tide currents were faster during spring tides than neap tides. The data
   suggest that both daily and lunar spawning cycles are influenced by
   daily and lunar variation in the speed of offshore currents. Population
   densities on all reefs had returned to pre-recruitment levels within 3
   mo of the end of seasonal recruitment. Monthly mortality (\% dying per
   month) on each study reef during the post-recruitment period was
   correlated with population density on that reef at the start of the
   month. This may suggest that post-recruitment mortality is
   density-dependent, but it could result from the covariance of density
   with age. However, the mean monthly mortality rate over the
   post-recruitment period on each reef was significantly correlated with
   recruitment strength to that reef. This suggests that post-recruitment
   mortality is density-dependent, and hence that post-recruitment
   processes influence the population dynamics of bluehead wrasse in
   Barbados.}},

Abstract = {{Topdressings prepared from cornmeal-sand mixtures infested with strains
   of Enterobacter cloacae were used to introduce bacterial antagonists
   into bentgrass putting greens naturally infested with Sclerotinia
   homoeocarpa.  Topdressings fortified with E. cloacae strains EcCT-501
   and E1 significantly reduced dollar spot disease development when
   compared with untreated plots.  In some experiments, monthly
   applications of strain EcCT-501 provided up to 63\% disease control and
   was as effective as iprodione or propiconazole in reducing dollar spot
   severity.  Disease suppression induced by strains EcCT-501 and E1 was
   evident up to 2 mo after application.  Dollar spot suppression was more
   effective when E. cloacae was applied as a preventive treatment rather
   than a curative treatment.  However, strain EcCT-501 significantly
   reduced dollar spot severity when applied to severely diseased turf. 
   Introduced populations of selected strains of E. cloacae in putting
   greens were monitored in both 1988 and 1989.  Recoverable populations of
   selected E. cloacae strains immediately after application were
   approximately 10(7)-10(9) colony-forming units (cfu) per gram dry weight
   of thatch in both 1988 and 1989.  Although populations in both years
   declined, they remained at levels greater than 10(4) cells per gram for
   up to 13 wk and were detectable in the spring of 1989 after 1988 summer
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Phyllopod populations were monitored in three temporary pools differing
   in the amount of submerged, peripheral vegetation present, surface area
   and duration. The effects of these factors on the life history
   strategies employed by phyllopods were investigated.  Triops granarius,
   various conchostracan species and the anostracan Branchipodopsis sp.
   inhabited the periphery of two pools where rooted, submerged vegetation
   was abundant while three Streptocephalus species dominated the central,
   unvegetated regions of the pools and the unvegetated pool. This
   distribution pattern appeared to be related to the animals' morphology
   and feeding habits. The peripheral regions of the pools were stressful
   habitats since they were colonized by large numbers of predators and
   competitors 30-40 days after inundation and they dried out sooner than
   the centre. The `peripheral' species exhibited typical r-selected life
   history strategies; they grew rapidly, reproduced early and had short
   lifespans and in this way they overcame the threats presented by their
   habitat. The `central' species took advantage of their predator-free,
   more stable habitat and exhibited life history patterns which tended
   towards the K-end of the r-K continuum. A degree of intraspecific
   variation in growth and reproduction was obvious and appeared to be
   related to differences in habitat duration of the three pools.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of peat, mineral fertilizer and sewage sludge on tree growth
   and mycorrhizal status were monitored after planting replicate
   enclosures containing oil sands tailings with container-grown jack pine
   (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and subalpine coal mine spoil with white spruce
   (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss).  Growth was generally better on coal spoil
   than oil sands tailings.  Adding sewage sludge greatly increased growth
   of jack pine and both sewage sludge and peat improved the growth of
   white spruce.
   Populations of sheathing mycorrhizas on ``egressed{''} roots were
   monitored for 10 years by direct observation and isolation techniques. 
   The proportions of short roots of jack pine that were mycorrhizal ranged
   from 5 to 25\% in Year 1, from 24 to 74\% in Year 2 and from 29 to 91\%
   in Year 4; their development was highest in the peat treatment and
   lowest in the fertilizer and unamended ``control{''} treatments. 
   Mycorrhizas of white spruce developed much more rapidly in coal mine
   spoil than those of jack pine in oil sands tailings:  approximately 90\%
   of short roots were mycorrhizal in coal spoil after 2 years irrespective
   of treatment.
   Thelephora terrestris was the dominant fungus on pine for the first 4
   years except when growing with peat amendments when E-strain
   (Complexipes) dominated.  Later Suillus spp. became more important,
   until after 10 years 32\% of mycorrhizas were formed by Suillus.  The
   early stage fungi, E-strain and T. terrestris, persisted and formed 23
   and 17\% of mycorrhizas after 10 years, respectively.
   In contrast to events on pines in oil sands tailings, E-strain fungi
   formed nearly all spruce mycorrhizas for the first 2 years; it was not
   until seedlings were 4 years old that E-strain began to be replaced by
   Amphinema byssoides (Fr.) J. Erikss.  By Year 7 A. byssoides dominated
   all treatments (62-90\%), but thereafter its abundance decreased.  In
   Year 10, the dominant fungi on spruce were A. byssoides (19\%), Hebeloma
   (19\%), E-strain (25\%) and Tomentella spp. (14\%).  These temporal
   changes suggest that the fungi forming mycorrhizas with jack pine and
   white spruce are subject to replacement in an ordered sequence that was
   not significantly affected by soil amendments or vigor of the host.

Abstract = {{Dimilin(R) WP-25 (diflubenzuron) was applied at a rate of 70 g active
   ingredient (AI) in 10, 5, and 2.5 L/ha to three spray blocks in a mixed
   boreal forest near Kaladar, Ontario, Canada.  Water, sediment, and
   aquatic plants were collected from two pounds and a stream at intervals
   up to 30 days post-treatment for analysis of diflubenzuron (DFB)
   residues.  The duration of detectable residues was different for each
   substrate, but in all cases was less than two weeks.  Zooplankton and
   benthic invertebrate populations were monitored for up to 110 days
   post-spray in two ponds in the high volume rate block and in control
   ponds.  Significant mortality occured in two groups of caged
   macroinvertebrates (amphipoda and immature corixidae) 1 to 6 days after
   the ponds were treated with Dimilin.  Three taxa of litoral insects
   (Caenis, Celithemis and Coenagrion) were significantly reduced in
   abundance in the treated ponds 21 to 34 d post-treatment, but recovered
   to pre-treatment levels by the end of the season.  Of the six remaining
   groups studied, only one (immature corixidae), may have been slightly
   affected by treatment.  Zooplankton (cladocera and copepoda) populations
   were reduced 3 days after treatment and remained suppressed for 2-3
   months.}},

Abstract = {{Data on survival in and emergence from soil seed banks are scarce for
   natural plant populations.  In this paper I present a new experimental
   method for quantifying soil seed bank dynamics in the field and data
   derived from this method describing the age structure of the seed bank
   for the winter annual Collinsia verna.  The roles of spatial and
   temporal variation in seed bank formation were investigated using a
   replicated design arrayed along three transects in the study site. 
   Emergence from and persistence in the seed bank were monitored for 3 yr
   using experimental seed banks containing seeds of the same age arrayed
   along each of the three transects.  In addition, replicate estimates of
   survivorship and fecundity of naturally emerging plants were monitored
   in quadrats arrayed along each of the three transects.  The conditional
   probability of persisting in the seed bank for 1 yr ranged from 14 to
   45\% and differed significantly among the transects.  Significant
   differences in the probabilities of emerging (or persisting) produced
   seed banks of varying age structure among the transects and years.  A
   life table analysis of the vegetative plants indicated significant
   differences between years in their survivorship curves.  In addition,
   seedlings derived from seeds 1 yr old or older germinated significantly
   later than the general seed population.  Age-structured seed banks are
   expected to alter the population dynamics and demographic projections of
   plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{The population growth and spatial distribution of three Dalbulus
   leafhopper species were monitored on maize (Zea mays L.) from the
   seedling stage through maturation and senescence under greenhouse
   conditions.  D. maidis, a maize specialist, completed two generations
   before maize senescence, with a significant population increase between
   the first and second generation.  F1 nymphs and adults moved upward on
   leaves (vertically) and from outer leaves into whorls (horizontally)
   soon after eclosion.  D. gelbus, a gamagrass (wild maize relative)
   specialist also found on maize in the field, completed two generations
   on maize, but with a significant decrease in population size between
   generations.  D. gelbus moved upward on leaves as F1 nymphs and adults,
   but not into whorls as frequently as D. maidis.  D. quinquenotatus, a
   gamagrass specialist, produced one generation on maize, with population
   extinction occurring soon after adult eclosion on post-anthesis maize. 
   Nymphs and adults remained within protective leaf sheaths of lower
   leaves, and did not move upward on leaves or into whorls.  Some
   individuals moved onto tillers developing at the base of maize stalks. 
   Utilization of the whorl is suggested to be critical in establishing a
   large second generation before maize senescence.  Differences in the
   behavioral responses of Dalbulus species to maize phenology may explain,
   in part, the observed field host associations, and influence pest
   potential of Dalbulus species.}},

Abstract = {{Dose-mortality bioassays were begun in 1984 to determine the
   susceptibility of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), to
   commonly used pyrethroids.  Responses of different populations from the
   northwestern region of Mexico were compared with responses of two
   susceptible strains.  The LD50's indicated that the populations have
   been and are being selected for resistance to varying degrees.  A
   population from Valle de Mexicali had the highest LD50 and resistance
   ratio for deltamethrin.  The highest LD50's for permethrin were obtained
   from 1987 populations from Valle del Yaqui and Valle de Mexicali
   (resistance ratios of 55.4 and 48.7, respectively).  Resistance ratios
   from Valle del Yaqui for cypermethrin indicated that the 1987 tobacco
   budworm population was 32 times more resistant that the susceptible
   colony.  Although control failures have not been reported from these
   areas, the dose-mortality data suggest that control failures may occur. 
   Permethrin resistance appears to be increasing in Valle del Yaqui, Costa
   de Hermosillo, and Valle de Mexicali.  Resistance to cypermethrin and
   cyfluthrin seems to be increasing in Valle del Yaqui and Valle de
   Mexicali.  On the basis of LD50's, deltamethrin resistance remains low
   except for Valle de Mexicali but should be carefully monitored.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting insecticide resistance before it increase above a critical
   level has been a driving force in developing tests to estimate
   resistance severity in field populations.  Here, estimates of resistance
   severity (r) are classified into one of three categories.  The
   classification is based on comparing r with two preselected levels of
   resistance severity (theta) to obtain a three decision sampling plan. 
   Using the example of fenvalerate resistance in beet armyworm, Spodoptera
   exigua (Hubner), each theta was selected by comparing resistance test
   responses of populations that differed in resistance and exposure to
   insecticides.  Test response was corrected for survival of moths after
   exposure to a 1,00-mu-g/g concentration of fenvalerate.  This
   concentration was selected by comparing probit lines of susceptible and
   fenvalerate-selected strains.  The determination that r was greater or
   less than each theta was made using sampling inspection plans based on
   the binomial distribution.  A sequential sampling plan using the
   sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) required less sampling effort
   than single sampling plans of equal strength and was suited to our
   operational needs.  Using the same susceptibility test, sequential
   analysis of survival proportions from the 1,000-mu-g/g concentration was
   also compared with probit analysis of survival proportions from multiple
   concentrations.  Sampling effort required for the SPRT was substantially
   lower than that required for probit analysis.  Despite differences in
   probit analysis and SPRT assumptions, probit estimates of resistance
   severity at 1,000-mu-g/g agreed with sequential classification of r
   using a 1,000-mu-g/g concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality from nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) among gypsy moth,
   Lymantria dispar (L.), neonates hatched from field-collected egg masses
   and larvae collected from the field was monitored at study sites in
   Massachusetts during 1983 through 1987.  Mortality and prevalence of NPV
   were related to six potential predictor variables that could be obtained
   before egg hatch occurred in the field.  These variables were calculated
   from egg mass density (EM Density), the number of larvae hatching from
   egg masses (Hatch) and the proportion of infection among hatching larvae
   (EM NPV).  Logistic regression analyses suggest that transovum
   transmission is density-independent after an epizootic, whereas
   larva-to-larva transmission remains density-dependent.  Differences may
   be due to the persistence of NPV on surfaces through which transmission
   is mediated.  NPV prevalence and mortality were related to density
   estimates but not EM NPV or Hatch.  An estimate of first instar density
   (L1 Density = EM Density x Hatch) provided the highest coefficient of
   determination, although an estimate of cadavers produced during the
   first wave of mortality (EM NPV x L1 Density) provided the best
   separation of epizootic from non-ezizootic sites.  Because egg mass
   weight was strongly correlated with Hatch, a sampling protocol that
   measures egg mass density, egg mass weight, and mortality among larvae
   reared from field-collected egg masses may provide a reasonable
   predictor of subsequent NPV effect.}},

Abstract = {{A bioassay was used to determine how addition of sorbic acid (0.63 and
   1.26\% dry mass) to an artificial diet affected survival of
   Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman through all life stages of three
   generations.  Development time of larvae and pupal weight were
   monitored.  Development on diets with 0 or 1.26\% sorbic acid was
   evaluated for insects that were held at 22 and 25-degrees-C. 
   Experimental data were used to estimate population growth on the various
   diets tested.  Addition of sorbic acid to the diet resulted in more
   rapid larval development and larger pupae, but survival through the
   pupal stage and viability of eggs were reduced.  Decreasing the sorbic
   acid concentration from 1.26 to 0.63\% greatly reduced the negative
   effects on survival, particularly in the F1 and F2 generations.  Many of
   the pupae from the diet containing 1.26\% sorbic acid exhibited
   morphological abnormalities characterized by deformed or missing wing
   pads.  For diets with no sorbic acid, the 25-degrees-C temperature was
   clearly better than 22-degrees-C for C. occidentalis survival,
   development time, and pupal weights.  However, population growth at
   22-degrees-C was better on the 1.26\% sorbic acid diet.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance of larvae and adults of the lesser cornstalk borer was
   monitored in conventionally tilled and planted Florunner peanuts at the
   Wiregrass Experiment Substation in Headland, Ala. from 1984 to 1986. 
   Larval abundance was monitored by soil sieving ca. weekly throughout the
   growing season.  The abundance of adults was monitored weekly by
   flushing male and female moths from rows by beating plants with a stick.
   Regression was used to determine if adults in week `i' can explain the
   variation in larval abundance in week `i + 1,' over the three years of
   observation.  The mean number of larvae from week `i + 1' increased
   linearly with an increase in adult flush counts from week `i' (P <
   0.0001, r2 = 0.91), indicating that larval density could be predicted by
   adult abundance.  The resulting equation had an intercept that was not
   significantly different from zero (P = 0.29) and a slope of 12.66 +/-
   0.88 (P < 0.0001), indicating that about 13 larvae/meter can be expected
   to be found one week later for each adult/meter flushed.
   Observations from five separate peanut fields were taken in 1990 to
   determine if adult counts do reflect larval abundance as predicted by
   the regression equation.  Means from four of five model validation
   fields fell within the 95\% confidence limits for the regression
   equation, indicating excellent agreement with the field data.  This
   equation could be a significant addition to management of the lesser
   cornstalk borer, because the use of adult flush counts allows for the
   prediction of damaging and difficult to sample larval populations before
   they occur.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly beleived that runoff from heavy rainfall is not
   detrimental to the O content of rural streams free from industrial and
   municipal discharges.  However, evidence is presented of low dissolved O
   (DO) concentrations during high flows (caused by agricultural runoff
   during summer rainstorms) in southern Wisconsin streams.  Continuous
   monitoring of streams with in situ oxygen meters indicated a rapid
   decrease in dissolved oxygen with a rise in the hydrograph.  The cause
   of the oxygen reduction may be due to one or more factors such as (i)
   inflow of large volumes of runoff with low DO concentrations, (ii) the
   influx or resuspension of O demanding materials as a result of the storm
   water input, (iii) decreased O solubility caused by increased water
   temperature, and (iv) possible reduced photosynthetic productivity. 
   Loss of DO is important because it appears to be associated with fish
   kills and declining sport fish populations in streams in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Although a substantial proportion of the health-care expenditure of
   developing countries is spent on the acquisition of drugs, this is only
   sufficient to serve about a quarter of their population.  Therefore it
   is inconceivable that WHO's goal of HEALTH FOR ALL by the year 2000
   could even be approached without consideration being given to the role
   in health care systems of herbal medicines.  In this endeavour,
   traditional herbal medicines must perforce be granted the benefits of
   modern science and technology to serve future global needs.  Here we are
   addressing both a contigency situation as well as a long term one.  In
   developing nations there is a dire need for an improved supply of
   therapeutic agents for a variety of diseases that are characteristic of
   deprivation and poverty.  In addition herbal medicines promise to
   provide both concepts of therapy, as well as therapeutic agents in areas
   where modern medicine has few answers.  UNIDO's programmes for technical
   assistance to developing nations aim at the fullest utilisation of
   traditional herbal-based pharmacopoeias in addressing both these
   situations.  They have employed a multi-disciplinary approach to the
   industrial production of herbal medicines.  The projects endeavour to
   utilise the natural flora, judiciously, for selection, domestication and
   crop-wise cultivation of medicinal plant species for industrial
   processing.  National R \& D efforts have been strengthened to include
   the development of expertise in several areas such as instrumental
   analyses, biological assessment of raw materials as well as products. 
   Process technology development has received special attention.  A
   versatile poly-functional pilot plant has been developed to enable the
   production of herbal preparations as well as extracts and
   phytochemicals.  It is possible to simulate the traditional process
   rationally yet preserved modern scientific parameters of process
   monitoring and good manufacturing practice.  The production of
   phyto-pharmaceutical preparations on an industrial scale represents to
   many developing countries an important avenue of sustaining their
   programmes of health-care so vital to social and economic growth.  This
   aspect as well as the prospect of novel drugs for modern medicine cry
   out for the global effort towards the traditional pharmacopoeias which
   is still awaited.}},

   The distribution of grubs in calves' backs was compared with the

   distribution parameters, suggesting that the negative bionomial is an
   inappropriate choice for the basis of a sampling model.  The
   relationship between the mean number of grubs per animal (xBAR),

   was determined and used as the basis for the sampling model.  The
   relationship between p0 and p0e {[}determined using serology (ELISA)]
   was evaluated.  The variance of estimates of mean grubs per animal based
   on the regression model and uncertainty due to using p0e as an estimate
   of p0 was examined.  A test of the model indicated that p0e could be
   used to obtain a reliable estimate of mean grubs per animal and that the
   method would be applicable for monitoring grub populations, assessing

Abstract = {{Sensitivities (ED50 values) of 300 monoconidial isolates of Venturia
   inaequalis to the sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) flusilazole were
   determined, based on the inhibitory effect on mycelial growth.  Isolates
   were collected from three different orchards:  in orchards 1 and 2, DMIs
   had never been used, whereas various DMIs had been tested for 12 yr in
   orchard 3.  ED50 values for individual isolates were lognormally
   distributed, ranging from 0.0006 to 0.17, 0.0016 to 0.14, and 0.0007 to
   0.065-mu-g ml-1 in orchards 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Population means
   of the log transformed ED50 values were 0.0068, 0.01, and 0.076-mu-g
   ml-1 for orchards 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Although the mean
   sensitivities were similar for all three sites, the mean ED50 value of
   orchard 2, in which DMI fungicides had never been used, was
   significantly higher than the mean of the two other orchards. 
   Furthermore, the population of orchard 3, which was exposed to DMI
   fungicides for 12 yr, had not become more resistant to flusilazole
   compared to unexposed populations.  Thus, differences in mean
   sensitivities of V. inaequalis populations are not necessarily related
   to the history of use of DMIs.  Regardless of small differences among
   orchards, the variance of sensitivities determined for the three
   populations was homogenous, and all ED50 values could be combined in one
   distribution.  Sample sizes necessary to detect differences in mean
   population sensitivities were determined based on the variation among
   all 300 isolates.  A sample size of 50 was sufficient to detect a
   difference of 1.6 times the mean ED50 value.  Sample sizes of > 50 did
   not greatly improve the precision of the test, whereas with sample sizes
   of < 15, the detectability of sensitivity differences among populations
   was decreased.  The magnitude of growth inhibition at a single fungicide
   concentration close to the mean ED50 value of the baseline population
   was found to include a precise measure of flusilazole sensitivities and,

Abstract = {{The population of Great White pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus breeding in
   the Palaearctic (from Greece to the USSR) is estimated at more than 10
   000 pairs. This species has, however, been very little studied and the
   restricted amount of ringing carried out on this bird has not greatly
   improved our knowledge of its migration routes and wintering areas.
   Counts have been carried out during the autumn migration period over
   several years at three different sites (Greece, Bulgaria and Israel) and
   the migration routes, the stopover sites and the numbers of birds can
   now be described with precision. By using a motorized glider, migrating
   pelicans could be followed from the north to the south of Israel in a
   single day, the average speed could be estimated and further information
   on the flight capabilities could be obtained. After the discovery of
   very high numbers during the migration period, the hypothesis has been
   advanced that non-breeding Great White pelicans do not remain on their
   wintering grounds, but return each spring to oversummer in the
   Palaearctic. The majority of the population of Great White pelicans
   breeding in the Palaearctic used to winter in the Nile delta (Egypt) at
   the start of this century. Because of the numerous developments carried
   out in the delta, however, they no longer winter there and they have
   been forced to find another wintering area further south. Unfortunately,
   this new site is still unknown and several hypotheses are proposed.
   Finally we recommend that movements be monitored by satellite in the
   future in order to discover the new wintering site(s) of this species
   and to confirm the correctness of the migration routes described in this
   study.}},

   the rate of Hg accumulation is significantly faster in females than in
   males and mean Hg levels were higher in females.  Relationships
   describing Hg vs size and age dependence were determined for both
   species and sexes and patterns and rates of Hg accumulation were
   discussed in relation to a number of biological and ecological factors

Abstract = {{Studies were made of seedling emergence of three phenotypes of Avena
   fatua L. with different coloured lemmas (fA, fB, fC) originally
   collected from one site. Each phenotype was grown under the same
   conditions in 1975 and the resulting seed buried 25 mm deep in soil
   immediately after collection. The soil was either left uncultivated (all
   phenotypes) or cultivated monthly (phenotype fA only). Seedling
   emergence was assessed weekly and the number of remaining viable seeds
   was determined at the end of three years. Seeds of different lines of A.
   fatua (fA phenotypes) obtained from separate locations were grown under
   the same conditions in 1983, buried and seedling emergence monitored for
   8.5 months.
   Without cultivation, overall emergence (mean of three phenotypes) in
   successive autumns and springs was 9 \%, 18 \%, 9 \%, 33 \%, < 1 \%, 14
   \% and < 1 \%. A further 3 \% of viable seeds were recovered at the end
   of the experiment. Periodicity of emergence was the same for all
   phenotypes. Actual numbers of seedlings emerging in each of the periods
   varied between phenotypes. Total emergence of seed from the inner zone
   of panicles was significantly less than that from the outer zone,
   although there was little difference between the two zones in each of
   the natural emergence periods. Cultivation increased emergence,
   particularly from secondary seed in the first spring after burial, but
   did not changes its periodicity. By the second spring seed numbers had
   declined, and seedling counts were similar from cultivated and
   non-cultivated soil. No viable seed remained in the cultivated soil
   after three years. Emergence from the two lines of fA was very
   different. Seedling emergence occurred after hot dry conditions, or in
   warm periods immediately after periods of chilling, particularly those
   below 4-degrees-C.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities have had profound effects on bald eagle (Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus) populations.  Few experimental studies exist that address
   the effects of human activities on foraging eagles during the breeding
   season.  Information from these types of studies is needed so that
   resource managers can allow humans and eagles to coexist.  We
   investigated the response of breeding bald eagles to human activities in
   foraging areas on the Columbia River estuary, Washington-Oregon, during
   spring and summer, 1985 and 1986.
   We distinguished between 2 forms of interaction.  In the first, a moving
   human approached a stationary eagle and induced a disturbance.  This
   type of interaction was rare on the Columbia River estuary and accounted
   for a minor proportion of an eagle's time-energy budget.  Only 20\% of
   all moving human activities observed during this study resulted in
   human-eagle encounters within 500 m, and < 6\% of all encounters
   resulted in a visible disturbance to an eagle.  In the second form of
   interaction, an eagle had a choice of alternative foraging sites, some
   of which may have had human activities occurring nearby.  In this
   situation, the eagle had the freedom to choose a destination, given the
   pattern of human activities.  This type of interaction represented the
   major form of human-eagle interaction on the Columbia River estuary.  To
   investigate this, we studied 6 pairs of eagles in each of 2 years; each
   pair was sampled 3 times during the breeding season, corresponding to
   incubation, nestling, and postfledging stages of the nesting cycle. 
   Each sample consisted of a 3-day control period, during which we
   monitored ``normal{''} eagle activity patterns, and a 3-day influence
   period, during which we ``disturbed{''} (i.e., stationary boat with
   observer) a high-use foraging area.  We compared eagle activity patterns
   within 1,200 m of the experimental disturbance between sampling periods.
   Eagles typically avoided an area within 400 m of the experimental
   stationary boat, although avoidance areas ranged between 200-900 m among
   pairs.  In most cases, eagles spent less time and made fewer foraging
   attempts in the sample area during the influence period.  Responses were
   consistent among nesting stages, although foraging activity increased
   dramatically and was more concentrated in the high-use areas during the
   later nesting stages.  Although we cannot decisively conclude that human
   activities were directly responsible for current eagle spatial use
   patterns, the results of the experimental disturbances confirmed that
   boating activities have the potential to significantly affect eagle
   spatial use patterns.  Based on these results, we developed a model of
   human-eagle interactions in foraging areas.  We used this model and the
   results of this study to develop several alternative management
   strategies involving temporal and spatial restrictions of human
   activity.  We recommend buffer zones 400-800 m wide around high-use
   foraging areas of bald eagles as the most appropriate management
   strategy for the Columbia River estuary.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess degradation and utilization of
   the mucus produced by 3 coral reef Anthozoa (Sarcophyton, Fungia and
   Acropora) by microorganisms.  This was achieved by carrying out long
   term in situ incubations at Noumea lagoon (New Caledonia).
   The microbial population including bacterial and eukaryotic cells was
   monitored by cell counts, cultures of mucus degraders, and by estimation
   of microbial activity from the pool of adenylates and enzymatic
   activity.  In addition the chemical composition (C and N) of the mucus
   was monitored and its morphological features were observed by scanning
   electron microscope (SEM).
   Only slight differences were found between the 3 types of mucus studied.
   On the whole, they follow the same pattern of change.  After a short
   bacterial growth phase (4 days), a bloom of eukaryotes (Flagellates,
   Ciliates and Diatoms) was observed.  This eukaryote population remained
   constant for at least 10 days.  A similar pattern has been described in
   the breakdown of detritus of plant origin.
   Several observations suggest that bacteria utilize only certain
   components of mucus, the most widely used being proteins, triglycerides
   and wax esters; these latter two compounds are known to be the dissolved
   photosynthetic products released by zooxanthellae during mucus
   secretion.  Neither bacteria nor eukaryotes completely degrade the mucus
   web even after 21 days of incubation.  The likelihood that mucus
   excretion is a defensive reaction against physical and chemical stresses
   might explain why mucus is a poor, or even inhibiting medium for the
   bacterial degraders isolated from the mucus itself.}},

   rendering the conventional sex attractant for male G. molesta Busck more
   species specific.  The greatest inhibitory effect was observed with
   (Z)-6-dodecenyl acetate, which significantly decreased G. funebrana
   captures when added at 0.1\% or more to the known attractant blend. 
   This compound also inhibited G. molesta captures, but to a much lesser
   extent.  At sites with high population density, 92\% of all Grapholitha
   spp. caught were G. molesta with baits containing (Z)-6-dodecenyl
   acetate, and 67\% with baits without this compound.  Although G. molesta
   captures in traps with (Z)-6-dodecenyl acetate were about half of those
   in traps without, captures were still high enough to permit reliable
   monitoring of the occurrence of G. molesta.  However, in commercial

Abstract = {{The study investigated the relationship between home range and food
   abundance in a population of the southern brown bandicoot, Isoodon
   obesulus, in Western Australia.  Home range areas were estimated seven
   times between 1986 and 1988 by live-trapping, spool-and-line devices and
   fluorescent pigment tracking.  The abundance of invertebrate food was
   measured simultaneously by placing pitfall traps within the home ranges
   of individual animals, and by sampling invertebrates in topsoil and
   litter.  Home range areas tended to be negatively correlated with food
   abundance, especially in the autumn and winter of 1986 and 1987.
   The influence of food on home range was investigated further in
   September 1988 by providing eight individual I. obesulus with a
   supplementary food mixture.  Contrary to expectation, the added food
   caused an increase in home range area, home range overlap and
   displacement, as well as an influx of new individuals to food stations. 
   In contrast, home range parameters in control (non-fed) individuals
   changed little during the experiment.
   The shuffling of home ranges due to feeding suggests that the home range
   system of I. obesulus is relatively flexible, with individuals
   monitoring and exploiting resources in an opportunistic manner.  In
   contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence that I. obesulus was
   territorial.  We speculate that individuals may be territorial at low
   population density if resources are defendable and intruder pressure is
   low, but occupy overlapping ranges if population density is high.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquitoes were caught in bedrooms in Tanzanian villages by human-biting
   catches and in light-traps set close to occupied untreated bed nets. 
   Catches by each method were carried out on pairs of nights in the same
   week at different seasons and in different villages.  The pairs of
   adjacent catches by the different methods showed a strong correlation. 
   Analysis of the ratio between the catches by the two methods on pairs of
   nights in the same week indicated that on average three light-traps
   caught about the same number of mosquitoes as a team of two human
   catchers.  The ratio did not differ significantly between Anopheles
   gambiae Giles (sensu lato), A. funestus Giles, and Culex
   quinquefasciatus Say, nor between the villages, or between times when
   mosquito populations were high or low.  The distribution of numbers of
   ovarian dilatations differed significantly between catches in different
   villages and seasons but not between pairs of catches by the two
   methods.  Similarly, the parity and sporozoite rates agreed between
   pairs of light-trap and house-resting catches, but differed markedly
   between villages and seasons.  Thus it is concluded that light-traps
   used in conjunction with bed nets catch a representative sample of the
   vectors which would have bitten humans in bedrooms in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Results of experimental crosses between individuals from geographically
   separated populations indicate that Tampa Bay Polydora ligni are
   reproductively isolated from their North Carolina and Los Angeles
   morphological counterparts. The North Carolina and Los Angeles
   populations of P. ligni are interfertile. The Tampa Bay population of
   Streblospio benedicti is likewise reproductively isolated from the
   planktotrophic North Carolina population. In both genera, experimental
   crosses were conducted in the laboratory using individual worms that had
   been raised in isolation prior to the experimental cross. Female worms
   from unsuccessful interpopulation crosses were back-crossed to
   intrapopulation males to ensure female fertility. Inter- and
   intrapopulation crosses in P. ligni were accomplished via artificial
   transfer of spermatophores from an isolated male to an isolated female.
   In Streblospio crosses, males and females from appropriate populations
   were placed together and monitored daily for reproductive activity. The
   presence of spermatophores with active sperm in Streblospio cultures was
   taken to indicate male fertility. In the P. ligni complex, reproductive
   breakdown appears to occur at the sperm transfer stage. In
   interpopulation crosses, females accept spermatophores from exotic males
   but the sperm fail to accumulate in the sperm storage organs of the
   female. In the S. benedicti complex, the breakdown is also at the sperm
   transfer stage. Males produce spermatophores in the presence (or
   absence) of exotic females but no viable larvae are produced from these
   crosses. Intrapopulational crosses in both genera are routinely
   successful. Morphological differences between the reproductively
   isolated P. ligni populations are inconsistent and variable making
   description of distinct species difficult. Morphological differences are
   present, at least in females, from the divergent S. benedicti
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of Paecilomyces farinosus and other microfungi on litter
   was monitored in two balsam fir forests infested with spruce budworm to
   determine the possible role of this fungus as a saprophyte in these
   forests.  The microfungi on the fir litter were similar to those found
   on other conifers.  Paecilomyces farinosus, however, was very abundant,
   and its abundance increased on the litter after it fell to the ground. 
   An apparent correlation between the abundance of the fungus and the
   population of spruce budworm suggests that opportunistic parasitism may
   positively affect the abundance of P. farinosus.}},

Abstract = {{Along cliff edges of the Niagara Escarpment in Ontario, Canada, Acer
   saccharum Marsh. is rarely found, but within 5 m of the cliff edge it
   becomes the dominant species of a rich deciduous forest on the plateau. 
   To discover how age-dependent and microsite-dependent processes combine
   to control the spatial distribution of this species along the
   environmental gradient, age structures of natural seedlings and saplings
   between 1 and 25 years old were investigated over a three-year period. 
   Mortality rates over the monitoring period were highest in 1-year-old
   seedlings and decreased gradually as age approached 10 years.  Both
   spatial and seasonal variation in environmental conditions affected
   1-year-old seedlings most, and these effects declined as seedling age
   increased.  The distribution of types of visible injury preceding death
   in the 1-year-old seedlings suggested that both drought and herbivory
   influenced survivorship in this species, but to different degrees at
   different positions on the gradient.  Lower seedling heights closer to
   the cliff edge in 1- to 10-year-old seedlings suggested that
   environmental conditions constrained productivity and survival.  These
   results clearly demonstrate that variation in age structures along the
   gradient was determined by both age- and microsite-dependent processes
   and that these both contribute to the spatial distribution pattern of A.

Abstract = {{The number of Protostrongylus spp. first-stage larvae in the feces of
   marked bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) was monitored from 1981 to 1988
   in southwestern Alberta.  Prevalence of infection was 100\%.  Counts
   were not correlated with spring precipitation, winter temperature, or
   number of female sheep in the study population.  Percent lamb survival
   and average counts were correlated only when years affected by the
   occurrence of a pneumonia epizootic were excluded.  In the years before
   the epizootic, but not afterwards, lambs born to females with high
   larval counts were less likely to survive to weaning or to 1 year of age
   than lambs born to females with low counts.  Fecal larval counts from
   the same female in successive years were weakly correlated, and tended
   to change towards the mean for all females.  Counts were affected by
   host reproduction but not by seasonal migration, and did not affect host
   survival.  Among lambs and yearlings, males had higher counts than
   females.  Lambs had higher counts than adult females.  There were no
   age-specific differences among adult females.  The larval count from
   female lambs was correlated with that from their mother but not that
   from male lambs.  Heart girth of female lambs was correlated with their
   larval count and that of their mother.  I suggest that larval counts are
   affected by infection intensity and body condition, do not predict
   pneumonia epizootics, and have limited reliability as an index of herd
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Correlates of the initiation of breeding by female Peromyscus
   maniculatus borealis (Mearns) were examined to test the hypotheses that
   asynchronous breeding was related to age, weight, matriline, and
   nest-site habitat.  Life-history data were collected by mark-recapture
   techniques and by monitoring natal nests over breeding seasons in 1985
   and 1986.  Timing of initiation of breeding was related significantly to
   nest-site habitat and age, but not to matriline or weight.  At
   approximately the same altitude, females nesting in dry rocky stream
   beds bred first, followed by those in open rock fields, then shrub
   areas, and last in subalpine forest.  Youngest animals bred first in all
   habitats, although the relationship between age and initiation date was
   weak.  Habitat effects appeared to be primarily related to microclimatic
   effects.  The influence of habitat on the timing of initiation of
   breeding also had consequences for reproductive success, total
   reproductive output, and survival.  Reproductive success of first
   litters was greatest for females nesting in rocky stream beds in the
   spring and least for females nesting in shrub and forest habitats.  The
   apparent advantages of early breeding in rocky stream beds were offset
   by greater overwinter mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Attempts to monitor the genetic variation of endangered populations by
   the use of blood protein electrophoresis often suffer from three
   drawbacks:  a small sample of loci, lack of control populations with
   ``normal{''} variation, and, sometimes, difficulty in confirming
   inheritance of electromorphs.
   An endangered isolate (Hamilton, Victoria) of the eastern barred
   bandicoot, Perameles gunnii, was compared with a widespread, dense,
   conspecific population in Tasmania.  A previous study of the effective
   size of the isolate suggested that the loss of variation should be
   detectable by protein electrophoresis if average heterozygosity (HBAR)
   was approximately 0.057 in widespread, dense populations and 20 to 50
   individuals from each population were analysed for 25 or more loci. 
   However, no genetic variation was detected within or between samples.
   Similar studies proposed as a baseline for monitoring genetic variation
   could be equally powerless to detect changes in variation, even with
   quite high HBAR values.  The analysis of variation in DNA is expected to
   avoid many of the problems associated with blood protein studies.
   This study highlights the importance of a control population.  Analysis
   of the Hamilton population alone might have led us to conclude that the
   recent population crash has been responsible for the low variation;
   however, this conclusion is not warranted, because HBAR = 0 in the much
   larger Tasmanian population.}},

Abstract = {{A four-stage method of providing conditions for improving the stability
   of a landscape sector is presented. In the first stage, structure and
   function of the landscape system is examined, predominantly based on the
   results of monitoring. In the second stage, a method is suggested for
   applying monitoring data to a dynamic structure with complex functions
   of the territory under examination. In the third stage, the territory is
   optimized as to the function of particular components within it. The
   optimization consists in controlling the dynamics of the flows of
   material, energy, and population within the sector. In the fourth stage,
   the holistic function of the landscape strip should be monitored with
   respect to representative key factors. The entire concept is based on
   assuming the existence of destabilizing processes leading to ecocritical
   situations and determining mitigating factors using heuristic methods of
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of integrated pest management has been accepted by forest
   pest managers for many years, but its implementation has been hindered
   by the lack of monitoring systems and decisionmaking tools.  Within the
   last seven years, monitoring systems have been developed which show
   promise as early-warning systems and for making control decisions. 
   Computer-aided decision-support tools such as models, database
   management systems, geographic information systems, and expert systems
   also show promise, but research in the areas of user interfaces and the
   incorporation of system intelligence is needed.  This paper reviews the
   advances made with monitoring systems and decision-support tools with
   reference to the major defoliators of North American forests.  Research
   accomplished by the Douglas-fir tussock moth, spruce budworm, and gypsy

Abstract = {{The Douglas-fir tussock moth is one of the most destructive forest
   defoliators in western North America.  Densities of most tussock-moth
   populations fluctuate over time with considerable regularity. 
   Fluctuations in density on warm, dry sites where populations have a high
   intrinsic rate of increase are more likely to periodically reach
   outbreak numbers than where rates of increase are relatively small. 
   Such cycles of abundance are inherent properties of the tussock-moth
   system that are not likely to change in susceptible host types.  Modern
   pest-management programs emphasize the annual monitoring of insects in
   forests with outbreak histories to determine early changes in population
   numbers and to predict trends.  When outbreaks develop, several
   environmentally safe chemical and microbial insecticides are effective
   in reducing larval numbers and preventing serious defoliation.  Computer
   models predicting growth loss, tree mortality, and top-kill during
   outbreaks are available as aids to making management decisions. 
   Silvicultural practices favoring seral nonhost species on high-risk
   sites may be the best prescription for reducing the impact of tussock
   moth outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{A naturally occurring virus often leads to the development of an
   epizootic late in the outbreak cycle of the Douglas-fir tussock moth,
   but not before significant damage occurs to the trees.  This virulent
   virus can be mass-produced in the laboratory and, when applied early in
   the outbreak cycle, can prevent severe defoliation.  This, however,
   requires that an early-warning system be integrated with a virus
   treatment.  The development and integration of a pheromone monitoring
   system with a virus treatment is described.  Stands susceptible to
   Douglas-fir tussock-moth outbreaks are defined by overlying maps of past
   outbreaks, forest and habitat types, and climatic zones. 
   Pheromone-baited traps are placed and monitored annually at permanent
   locations in the susceptible areas.  Measuring annual trends of moth
   density indicates the time and location of the next outbreak. 
   Trap-catch data provide an early warning of impending outbreaks.  This
   is confirmed by ground reconnaissance.  Insect density and defoliation
   is predicted from egg-mass and larval sampling.  The virus then can be
   applied from the air or from the ground into threatened stands to
   initiate an epizootic to prevent the development of an outbreak and to
   minimize tree damage.  The virus appears to spread, and field tests with
   reduced dosages indicate that that small amount of virus applied can
   still decimate larval populations and prevent tree mortality, at
   considerably reduced cost.}},

   trap design and lure potency that are effective over a wide range of
   population densities without trap saturation, and establishment of
   criteria for interpreting trap catches.  Examples of recently developed

Abstract = {{In Scotland, outbreaks of the pine beauty moth (Panolis flammea Denis
   and Schiffermuller (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae)), do not occur on its native
   host, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), but are associated with
   lodgepole pine (P. contorta Douglas) growing in deep unflushed peat.  A
   number of different approaches have been adopted to test the hypothesis
   that pine-beauty-moth outbreaks are caused by an increase in the
   nutritive quality of the foliage of the host plant due in some way to
   the `stress' imposed by being grown in deep peat relative to the quality
   of trees growing more vigorously in better soils.  These approaches
   were:  the monitoring of natural and manipulated populations; studies of
   the growth and survival of larval cohorts from which predators were
   excluded; analysis of the chemical content of pine foliage; the
   manipulation of plant quality by thinning and fertilizer application;
   and subsequent observations of foliar chemistry and population
   development.  No evidence was found to support the `stress' hypothesis;
   neither was any evidence found to support the view that Scots pine is a
   poorer host plant than lodgepole pine.  Alternative hypotheses are
   discussed, and it is concluded that predation and parasitism may be
   responsible for the observed outbreak behaviour of pine-beauty-moth
   populations in Scotland.}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal vertical profile sampling of the water column, during a fish
   killing bloom of the raphidophycean alga Heterosigma akashiwo, revealed
   a phytoplankton population otherwise composed almost entirely of a
   variety of dinoflagellates.  Of these Glenodinium danicum, Dinophysis
   acuta, Polykrikos schwartzii, Ceratium furca and Gyrodinium spirale were
   predominant.  The distribution of the major species within the
   phytoplankton were documented and evidence of synchronous vertical
   migration of H. akashiwo, G. danicum and P. schwartzii was observed. 
   Extracts of shellfish obtained during the bloom and tested by mouse
   bioassay showed no PSP toxicity but a marginal degree of DSP toxicity. 
   During a subsequent one year phytoplankton monitoring programme another
   potentially noxious species (Chaetoceros convolutus) appeared and the
   seasonal reoccurrence of species present during the bloom (e.g. H.
   akashiwo) was observed.  Important year to year differences in the
   summer phytoplankton (diatom versus flagellate dominated populations)
   were apparent and analysis of climate data showed that these differences
   related to different weather conditions prevailing during the two summer
   periods sampled.  The data suggest the fish killing bloom was giving a
   chance to develop by a prolonged period of warm, calm weather (during
   which several heavy rainfall events occurred) leading to stable
   hydrographic conditions (i.e. stratification) and an increase in the
   retention time of water within the bay.}},

Abstract = {{Population density determines the effluent load per unit land area and
   the concentration of contaminants in groundwater.  Numerous studies
   employing groundwater monitoring and modeling have demonstrated a
   correlation between water contamination and on-site sewage disposal
   density.  A survey of literature on density of systems indicates that in
   general a minimum lot size of one-half to one acre is needed to ensure
   against groundwater contamination.  However, some studies have found
   groundwater contamination from nitrate with lot sizes in this range due
   to site specific soil, hydrogeologic and climatic conditions.  Most
   studies relating density of on-site sewage disposal systems to
   groundwater contamination have focused on nitrate loading.  Additional
   research focusing on other effluent constituents is needed to improve
   our understanding of system density and water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Combined grazing by black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and
   bison (Bison bison) produces and maintains a series of changes in the
   vegetation of prairie dog colonies.  However, because their grazing
   patterns differ in frequency and intensity through time, their
   individual impacts may be different.  The objective of this study was to
   determine the individual and combined influences of these 2 herbivores
   in maintaining selected vegetation characteristics of a prairie dog
   colony in a mixed-grass prairie at Wind Cave National Park, S.D.  This
   was assessed by monitoring plant responses during 2 years following
   exclusion from grazing by 1 or both species.  In spite of their
   different grazing patterns, prairie dogs and bison had similar and
   independent (i.e., additive) effects in maintaining plant community
   structure.  For example, total above-ground biomass increased 32-36\%
   within 2 years of removal of each species, primarily as a result of
   increases in accumulation of graminoid biomass.  Plant species
   diversity, equitability, and dominance concentration were similar in all
   treatments both years, although there were slight decreases in relative
   abundance of forbs and increases in relative abundance of graminoids in
   the second year after removal of grazers.  Mean graminoid leaf nitrogen
   concentration (May to September) declined slightly but significantly
   after removal of prairie dogs (1.49 to 1.38\%) in 1985, and after bison
   exclusion (1.64 to 1.50\%) in 1986.  We suggest that rate of vegetation
   change following removal of grazers depends upon weather conditions,
   plant species composition, and prior intensity and duration of grazing.}},

Abstract = {{The autotrophic and heterotrophic nature of attached algal and bacterial
   populations in streams was investigated in July and August 1986.  Glass
   slides were colonized in two rivers in Algonquin Park, Ontario, that
   differed in their concentration of bioavailable phosphorus (P).  The
   importance of three abundant algal species was demonstrated by
   considering their activities on a cellular level using nuclear track
   autoradiography (NTA).  Community biomass accrual, carbon fixation, and
   phosphate uptake were monitored at bi-weekly intervals and were
   generally reflective of that of the dominant algal species in each
   river.  It has been proposed that, in running waters, nutrients do not
   cycle in place but are continually translocated downstream before being
   re-used by attached organisms.  This mode of recycling was demonstrated
   by monitoring biotic incorporation, release, and subsequent downstream
   re-incorporation of radiolabelled P and carbon (C) metabolites at the
   community and cellular levels.  The river with less bioavailable P
   re-assimilated the P metabolites more quickly, but C re-assimilation was
   similar in the two rivers.  This may account for observations that
   biomass development in running waters may exceed that predicted from
   empirical P-biomass relationships.
   Data presented also provide evidence that the species succession, and
   consequently the tiered development of a biofilm, was the result of the
   differing abilities of species to sequester and recycle organic and
   inorganic nutrients from overlying waters.}},

Abstract = {{Between July 1980 and February 1984, six jaguars (two males, four
   females) were fitted with radio-collars and monitored for a cumulative
   total of 105 months, in the Pantanal region of southwestern Brazil. Mean
   home range size (minimum convex polygon) for five of them (one male,
   four females) was 142.1 km2. Mean home range size during the dry season
   was 54.3 km2, whereas in the wet season it was significantly smaller,
   12.8 km2. Mean home range overlap of the four females was 42\%. Use of
   gallery forest and forest patches exceeded the availability of these
   habitat types in the animals' home ranges, whereas open forest and
   grassland were used less than expected on the basis of their
   availability. Mean distance moved between locations on consecutive days
   was 2.4 km (0.2-10.4 km). The mean one-day movement of the male jaguar
   was significantly (P < 0.01) larger than that of the females. Mean
   distance travelled by all animals during one-day intervals in the dry
   season was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than that travelled in
   other months. Jaguars were more active during daytime than night-time (P
   < 0.001). Overall level of activity for the wet season did not differ
   from that of the dry season. With their larger body size, jaguars in the
   Pantanal may require more food than jaguars in other areas of the
   species' range. This, in addition to differences in prey availability
   and the annual availability of dry land, appear to influence the
   difference in home range size between jaguar populations.}},

Abstract = {{A projection matrix model was constructed using vital rates for a
   vegetatively reproducing tiller population of Carex bigelowii monitored
   for four years.  Tillers were divided according to their age, size and
   type, as different morphological forms of tiller exist.  Two matrices
   were used:  one based on 1985 to 1986 transition probabilities when a
   massive flowering event occurred, resulting in a large decrease in
   population numbers, and one for the combined probabilities of the 1984
   to 1985, and 1986 to 1987 transitions with very low flowering rates. 
   When used separately, the two matrices led to rapid population growth,
   or extinction, respectively.  When used in combination, fluctuations in
   population size occurred, similar to those found in the field.  A
   long-term population growth rate close to stability (lambda = 1.001) was
   obtained when the cyclicity of flowering was set to every three years on
   average.  An elasticity analysis revealed the large dependence of
   population growth on the two youngest age classes of the foraging
   (long-rhizome) tiller type.  The ratio between tiller types is sensitive
   to environmental conditions such as soil fertility, and population
   growth rate will, therefore, respond markedly to changes in environment.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) are two trace gases related to
   metabolic activity that can be monitored in anerobic systems.  The
   responses of these two gases during organic and hydraulic overloads of
   anerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge were compared to
   conventional process indicators.  Results indicate that both gases
   supply additional information beyond that which current monitoring
   strategies provide.  Hydrogen provides information as to the level of
   stress being exerted on the CO2-reducing methanogenic population, and CO
   gives insight to the status of the acetate-catabolizing population. 
   These trace gases can be conveniently monitored on-line using a
   real-time data acquisition system.  They provide information that
   relates to the metabolic status of some of the key bacterial groups and
   augment information obtained via conventional process indicators
   studies, including volatile fatty acid to alkalinity ratio, gas
   production, and major components (CH4 and CO2) concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Macroinvertebrate populations including Gammarus pulex and Asellus
   aquaticus were surveyed at riffle sites on four lowland rivers, i.e. the
   Rivers Adur and Ouse and the Chess Stream, Sussex, and the Eridge
   Stream, Kent.  Sites were situated both upstream and downstream of
   sewage treatment works.  Macroinvertebrates were collected using a
   Surber sampler and at some sites the water analysed for the main
   chemical constituents.
   Poor water quality is characteristically associated with low biotic
   scores and in this respect the Gammarus:Asellus ratio applied to riffle
   data corresponded with the Chandler Biotic Score Index and the Extended
   Trent Biotic Index.  The Gammarus:Asellus ratio showed the closest
   correlations with concentrations of BOD, ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N),
   nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N) and phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) being
   sensitive to changes in water quality brought about by organic
   enrichment in the four rivers investigated.
   It is proposed that the Gammarus:Asellus ratio may provide a simple
   biological tool which could be used by anglers and other
   non-professional river users to routinely monitor water quality.}},

Abstract = {{An RNA derivative (pSPT 18.15) of Jeffreys' 33.15 human minisatellite
   core sequence was used to probe DNA from individuals of the peach-potato
   (Myzus persicae) and grain (Sitobion avenae) aphid. Sufficient and
   reproducible quantities of DNA (M. persicae = 0.90 +/- 0.19-mu-g DNA
   individual-1; S. avenae = 1.50 +/- 0.30-mu-g DNA individual-1) were
   extracted from individuals by whole-body homogenization to produce
   complex multi-locus DNA fingerprints. Profiles contained 19.5 +/- 2.4
   (M. persicae) and 14.8 +/- 1.2 (S. avenae) fragments per individual,
   mainly within the 0.6-6.6 kb range, and exhibited marked
   endonuclease-specific variations in complexity. Individuals from six
   clones of S. avenae found to be monomorphic at 11 putative allozymic
   loci could be distinguished using their DNA fingerprint profiles.
   Fingerprints from a clone of M. persicae were stable over nine
   parthenogenetic generations showing the absence of major genetic
   rearrangements ('endomeiosis') during apomictic parthenogenesis. The
   demonstration that sequences homologous to human minisatellite regions
   are both present and polymorphic in an invertebrate, coupled with the
   ability to characterize clones from individuals yielding small
   quantities of DNA show that genetic fingerprinting should be especially
   valuable for monitoring the diversity and dynamics of clonal animals in

Abstract = {{We face an increasing demand from administrative, technical and
   environmental authorities for bioindicators.  Animals, plants and
   community patterns, which register quantitative and qualitative
   environmental changes need to be monitored.  This can range from simple
   chemical and physical sampling to quantifying the patterns of animal and
   plant communities.  These techniques for analysing soil communities were
   first developed for aquatic systems.  Protozoans, earthworms, woodlice,
   myriapods, Acari, springtails and other groups of invertebrates seem to
   respond to chemical residues and other environmental stresses in many
   different ways.  Although a rich literature on interactions is
   available, only limited information exists at the community level and
   little is known of the food chain level in the soil.  Research is needed
   to find appropriate patterns which could model different situations.}},

Abstract = {{Activity levels within ant colonies are monitored by using a solid-state
   automatically digitizing camera.  The movement-activity levels of whole
   colonies and of isolated groups of workers are studied.  Whole colonies
   of Leptothorax allardycei show rhythmic changes in movement-activity
   level.  Fourier and autocorrelation analyses indicate that the activity
   levels of colonies are periodic, with an average period of 26 min. 
   Single, isolated workers do not show the pattern of periodic changes in
   activity level.  Single workers become active spontaneously, but at no
   particular interval.  Pairs of workers, confined together, also do not
   show periodicity in activity level.  One worker can stimulate another
   worker to become active, thus coupling their movement-activity patterns.
   As ants are placed in larger groups, the variation in the interval
   between activity peaks declines in a manner predicted by
   coupled-oscillator theory.  It is argued that the colony can be regarded
   as a population of excitable subunits, and it is shown that the results
   of this paper can be explained in this light.  The formal similarity
   between movement-activity patterns in ant colonies and the dynamics of
   epidemics is noted.  It is further argued that periodicity in the
   movement-activity levels of the colony is probably an epiphenomenon
   rather than an adaptation.  Selection at the colonial level probably
   acts on the spontaneity of activity and coupling strength to produce
   changes in the overall activity level of the colony.  One of the
   patterns that can result is periodicity in the colony's activity level,
   but it is not the only possible outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The Norwegian lemming, Lemmus lemmus (L.), the only endemic vertebrate
   species in Fennoscandia, normally lives in alpine tundra habitats. 
   During population peaks wandering lemmings may settle in forests, but
   they do not persist there.  Lemmings are adapted to winter conditions,
   so for them summer conditions appear more critical than winter.  At
   Kilpisjarvi, Finnish Lapland, fluctuations of five microtines have been
   monitored since 1946.  In the 1980s, lemmings have been less abundant
   than previously.  Results of annual trapping in June/July since 1960 are
   presented.  Lemmings may reproduce at any season and commonly do so
   under snow.  Mosses form the principal food item most of the time in all
   habitats and seasons.  The proportion of mosses in diet diminishes
   toward the end of the breeding season; when their amount increases,
   reproduction begins.  Since mosses grow in arctic areas during winter,
   lemmings have fresh food available all the year.  In Fennoscandia the
   coldest environments are not in the northernmost parts owing to the warm
   Gulf Stream.  Hence, as climate gets warmer, arctic species cannot
   retreat north and may become endangered.  If changes are too rapid, the
   extinction of the Norwegian lemming seems inevitable.}},

Abstract = {{We studied recovery processes for 3 yr in Quartz Creek (Cascade
   Mountains, Oregon), a third-order stream catastrophically impacted by a
   February 1986 debris flow for which both predisturbance data and an
   upstream control reach were available.  The debris flow altered channel
   geomorphology and destroyed riparian vegetation for 500 m, resulting in
   a reach with short, disordered channel units, low hydraulic retention,
   and an open canopy.  High irradiance levels and reduced grazing by
   macroinvertebrates contributed to rapid accrual of benthic algae in the
   disturbed reach, which formed the bioenergetic basis for ecosystem
   recovery.  Macroinvertebrates (mostly herbivores) recovered to upstream
   densities and taxonomic richness within 1 yr, although effects on
   community structure persisted into the second year.  Cutthroat trout
   (Oncorhynchus clarki) populations were locally decimated by the
   disturbance, but by the following year, recruitment of young-of-the-year
   trout into the reach exceeded that of the upstream reach and populations
   had recovered to predisturbance densities.  Despite the general rapid
   recovery of the biota within the disturbed reaches, most populations
   showed broad temporal fluctuations in abundance, suggesting that
   ecosystem stability was diminished by the debris flow.  Long-term
   monitoring of Quartz Creek may yield additional insight into the role of
   episodic disturbance in stream ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Wolf (Canis lupus) activity and interactions with white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) were monitored in north central Minnesota
   during six winters in which mean January-February snow depth alternated
   between shallow (19-26 cm) and relatively deep (40-47 cm) and winters
   (winter severity index; L.J. Verme. 1968. J. Wildl.  Manage. 32: 
   566-574) alternated between mild (71-98) and moderately severe
   (126-137).  Wolves traveled farther and more often and spent less time
   with other pack members in mild than in severe winters.  Radio-marked
   wolves and deer used conifer cover less, and fewer deer were killed
   there, when snow was shallow.  Similarly, fewer wolf-killed deer were
   found in and near deer concentration areas during mild winters.  Of the
   74 deer killed by wolves, the proportion that were fawns (54\%) differed
   from the proportion of fawns in the winter population (27\%), but
   neither varied with winter severity.  Few deer killed by wolves appeared
   debilitated.  Carcass consumption was high in all winters, regardless of
   their severity, but wolves scavenged less in mild than in severe winters
   (10 vs. 29\% of deer carcasses observed).  Thus, wolves changed winter
   activity, movement patterns, sociality, and feeding behavior in response
   to snow-induced changes in deer distribution and mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Presence of one or both members of a pair at the nest site during the
   incubation and early chick stage reduces reproductive losses due to
   predation and weather stresses. We monitored the presence of pair
   members by the temporary removal of one member of several pairs of
   Roseate (Sterna dougallii) and Common (Sterna hirundo) Terns at nests at
   Cedar Beach, New York, to determine if vulnerability varies by
   reproductive stage, to compare species differences that might partially
   account for declines in Roseate Tern populations, and to examine their
   response to trapping. There were significant differences between species
   in the time to return to the nest following an initial disturbance, and
   Roseate Terns that were trapped and released took longer to return to
   the nest and resume incubating than did Common Terns. The nests of
   Roseate Terns were vulnerable (neither adult in attendance) for longer
   time than were the nests of Common Terns.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated population trends of Black-capped (Parus atricapillus),
   Chestnut-backed (P. rufescens) and Mountain (P. gambeli) chickadees in
   the Pacific Northwest of North America using 41 years (1944-1985) of
   data from Christmas Bird Counts.  Most (7683\%) locations showed no
   significant trends (long-term increases or decreases in numbers of
   chickadees detected per observer hours) for any of the three species. 
   Five to 14\% of the locations had significant declines and 10 to 13\%
   had significant increases.  The recent range expansion by
   Chestnut-backed Chickadees in the Sierra Nevada of California was not
   accompanied by declines in Mountain Chickadee numbers.  Chestnut-backed
   Chickadee populations no longer appear to be increasing in the Sierra
   Nevada; however, some populations in the San Francisco Bay region of
   California are apparently still increasing.}},

Abstract = {{Water of sufficient quality and quantity is critical to all life. 
   Increasing human population and growth of technology require human
   society to devote more and more attention to protection of adequate
   supplies of water. Although perception of biological degradation
   stimulated current state and federal legislation on the quality of water
   resources, that biological focus was lost in the search for easily
   measured physical and chemical surrogates.  The ``fishable and
   swimmable{''} goal of the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (PL
   92-500) and its charge to ``restore and maintain{''} biotic integrity
   illustrate that law's biological underpinning.  Further, the need for
   operational definitions of terms like ``biological integrity{''} and
   ``unreasonable degradation{''} and for ecologically sound tools to
   measure divergence from societal goals have increased interest in
   biological monitoring.  Assessment of water resource quality by sampling
   biological communities in the field (ambient biological monitoring) is a
   promising approach that requires expanded use of ecological expertise. 
   One such approach, the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), provides a
   broadly based, multiparameter tool for the assessment of biotic
   integrity in running waters.  IBI based on fish community attributes has
   now been applied widely in North America.  The success of IBI has
   stimulated the development of similar approaches using other aquatic
   taxa.  Expanded use of ecological expertise in ambient biological
   monitoring is essential to the protection of water resources. 
   Ecologists have the expertise to contribute significantly to those
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{We studied temporal fluctuations in fruit production by plants and in
   populations of understory fruit-eating birds at three elevations (50,
   500, and 1000 m) in Costa Rican wet forests over a 12-16 mo period to
   investigate effects of resource variation on bird movements and
   community structure.  We used mist nets to monitor changes in frugivore
   abundance, migration patterns, and breeding and molting cycles.  We
   sampled understory fruits of each forest concurrent with studies of
   frugivores.  Both frugivores and fruit exhibited considerable seasonal
   variation in abundance.  Peak frugivore capture rates occurred during
   peak periods of ripe fruit abundance.  Altitudinal migrants left lower
   montane (1000 m) forest during periods of fruit scarcity and were
   present in lowland (50 m) and foothill (500 m) forest when ripe fruit
   was abundant.  Migrants, both altitudinal and temperate, accumulated fat
   before migration, and perhaps (for altitudinal migrants) in anticipation
   of breeding.  Some residents also put on fat before breeding.  Breeding
   was seasonal at all forests and occurred when ripe fruit abundance was
   low.  Results of this study indicate that birds may track changes in
   resource abundance.  Thus, variation in resource abundance influences
   dynamics of bird communities, both in terms of species composition and
   abundance.  Further, results illustrate the importance of viewing
   communities from different scales; dynamics at a local scale (e.g., one
   elevation) can be influenced by changes in conditions (e.g., fruit
   abundance) elsewhere.  That some species regularly move along
   elevational gradients implies that preservation of many species and of
   the biotic integrity of entire systems may require conservation of
   large, connected blocks of suitable habitat.}},

   Pachylobius picivorus (Germar), are part of a weevil complex causing
   extensive damage to plantation pines throughout the Lake States.  A
   means of monitoring weevil populations has been developed using pitfall
   traps baited with ethanol and turpentine.  The relative attractiveness
   of six combinations of ethanol and turpentine were compared.  Traps were
   monitored throughout the 1988 and 1989 growing seasons in a Scots pine
   Christmas tree farm.  Both species were more strongly attracted to
   ethanol/turpentine ratios above 1:1.  Pales weevils preferred slightly
   higher ethanol/turpentine ratios than did pitch-eating weevils.  Within
   species, both sexes responded equivalently among treatments.  The
   implications of these behavioral responses to weevils' locating stressed
   trees, the role of chemical ecology in niche partitioning, and IPM of
   pine root weevils are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In individually monitored red deer (Cervus elaphus) living in the North
   Block of the Isle of Rhum, Scotland, juvenile survival is related to the
   genotype at the enzyme loci Mpi and Idh-2 (each with two alleles, f and
   s). To establish whether other fitness components also are related to
   genetic differences, we examined whether age at first breeding,
   fecundity, and adult survival of females were related to genotype at the
   same loci. Fertility in females shot outside the study area was also
   analyzed in relation to Mpi and Idh-2 genotype. The analyses controlled
   for phenotypic and environmental factors affecting female reproductive
   performance. At Mpi, f-carrying females in the study area bred earlier
   than ss individuals and tended to be more fecund. However, no
   association was found between Mpi genotype and adult survival. In culled
   females, Mpi f-carriers were more likely to be pregnant than ss females.
   At Idh-2, homozygous females in the study area started breeding earlier
   than heterozygous females. Idh-2 fs and ss females were more fecund than
   ff females though this relationship was complicated by an interaction
   with spring temperature in the year of birth. When the population was at
   high density, adult survival of Idh-2 ss females was better than
   survival of ff females, which was, in turn, better than survival of fs
   females. No association was found between Idh-2 genotype and fertility
   in culled females. Overall, the associations found in female
   reproductive measures favor those genotypes that survive particularly
   badly over the first two years of life. This result supports the idea
   that countervailing selection in different fitness components
   (antagonistic pleiotropy) is a common and powerful force maintaining
   polymorphism in natural populations. It may also explain how fitness
   components can have large heritabilities while overall fitness may have

Abstract = {{1.  Body growth, reproduction and survivorship of Bosmina longirostris
   were monitored at four food concentrations (0.05, 0.10, 0.25 and 2.50 mg
   C l-1) to examine the extent to which food concentration affects these
   life-history parameters.
   2.  Food concentration had a significant effect on growth, and most of
   the reproductive parameters (size and age at maturation, brood size,
   instar duration and egg development time).  More than 60\% of animals
   died before maturation at the lowest food concentration, although most
   animals survived until maturation at other food concentrations.
   3.  Change in life-history parameters resulted in a decrease in rate of
   population growth (r) from 0.310 to 0.020 day-1 with decreasing food
   concentration, showing that this cladoceran is highly food-limited in
   many lakes.
   4.  Importance of the effect of food concentration on egg development
   time was emphasized in relation to analysis of natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Mark-resight data were analysed for thirteen cohorts from a
   declining population of southern elephant seals branded at Macquarie
   Island between 1951 and 1965.
   (2) First year survival was essentially stable during the 1950s at about
   46\% for females and 42\% for males.  There was a dramatic fall in first
   year survival during the 1960s, declining to less than 2\% for both
   sexes in 1965.  Post-year-1 survival did not change between the 1950s
   and the 1960s.
   (3) Comparisons with a stable population of southern elephant seals at
   South Georgia indicated that both first year and adult survival were
   lower in the Macquarie Island population.  There were no changes in the
   age at first breeding of the Macquarie Island seals during the study,
   but this was on average 1 year later than at South Georgia.
   (4) It is hypothesized that the current decline in elephant seal numbers
   at several of their major breeding islands is due to the populations
   returning to pre-sealing levels after they had risen to abnormally high
   levels with the end of commercial exploitation early this century.
   (5) Possible tests of the hypothesis include studying the diet and
   foraging behaviour of southern elephant seals to gain an understanding
   of the predator-prey relationships, continuing to census the Macquarie
   Island population to determine if the population levels out at around
   the estimated pre-sealing levels, and monitoring northern elephant seal
   populations which were also severly exploited but are currently
   increasing rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{Catch rates of black army cutworm moths, Actebia fennica (Lepidoptera: 
   Noctuidae), were determined for different types of traps and different
   dispenser loads of sex attractant.  Of the five traps tested, highest
   catch (approximately 35 males/per night) was obtained with Uni-Traps,
   whereas Pherocon 1CP, Delta and Hara traps rapidly became saturated at
   approximately 9, 6, and 11 males/per night, respectively.  Multi-Pher
   traps, like the Uni-Traps, have a covered vertical cone with a large
   collecting bucket but only catch about 1/3 of the number of moths
   (approximately 9 males/per night) as the Uni-Traps, thus reducing
   potential saturation.  Red rubber septa loaded with 500-mu-g of
   attractant blend gave a consistent catch for at least 60 days; 1000 and
   2000-mu-g loadings lasted for a minimum of 90 days.  Polyvinylchloride
   and red rubber septa dispensers containing 100-mu-g of attractant had
   similar catch rates, which decreased rapidly with age.  Based on these
   trap and lure-loading experiments, Multi-Pher traps baited with
   1000-mu-g of attractant in a red rubber septum were selected for future
   calibration studies between catch density and population fluctuations on
   susceptible sites.  Two years of monitoring results also are reported.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of the pump and filter system were studied in the
   occasionally suspension-feeding polychaete Nereis diversicolor. Feeding
   behaviour was observed on worms in glass tubes immersed in seawater.
   When algal cells were added to the surrounding water the worm made a
   funnel-shaped net-bag through which water was pumped by means of
   vigorously undulating movements of the body. Particles suspended in the
   inhalant water were retained by the net and later swallowed by the worm.
   The times spent on net-spinning, water-pumping through the complete net
   bag, and net-eating were: 97 +/- 35, 191 +/- 58, and 16 +/- 4 s,
   respectively. Stereotyped suspension-feeding behaviour was continuously
   recorded for 10 h by means of a computer-aided monitoring system. The
   volume of water cleared of algal cells (Rhodomonas baltica, diameter =
   6.3-mu-m) per unit time (clearance) was measured in worms of different
   size. Clearance (C, mu-l s-1) as a function of body dry wt (W, mg) was:
   C = 3.52 + 2.46 W (17-degrees-C). The clearance of 6.3-mu-m algal cells
   was 86\% of directly measured pumping rate, while the clearance rates of
   7.5 and 13.1-mu-m particles were identical with the directly measured
   pumping rate, thus indicating 100\% retention efficiency of particles >
   7.5-mu-m. For smaller particles the retention efficiency rapidly
   decreased to about 30\% for 3-mu-m particles. In order to characterize
   the Nereis pump the relation between imposed hydrostatic back pressure
   and pumping rate was measured in a number of worms. In several cases the
   pumping rate was not influenced by the imposed back pressure up to 3 mm
   H2O; but at higher back pressures the pumping rate was reduced
   simultaneously with a reduction in the undulation frequency. The maximum
   pressure head was around 8 mm H2O. It was found that N. diversicolor
   pumps about 401 of water per ml oxygen consumed, and the worm thus
   fulfills conditions for subsisting exclusively as a suspension feeder.
   The population pumping rate at the collecting site (2400 ind. m-2) was
   estimated to 9.8 m3 d-1 or 10 times the whole water column daily. This
   indicates that N. diversicolor is a hitherto undervalued key organism in
   the control of phytoplankton production in shallow brackish water areas.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of metals in the environment have greatly increased in
   the past decade since large quantities of pollutants are released
   annually in to the atmosphere.  Exposure of the population to
   atmospheric pollutants is believed to be responsible for the development
   of a number of illnesses and there is an increasing need for
   bio-indicators which may serve as monitors of pollutants such as heavy
   metals.  Many animal and plant species are used as bio-indicators. 
   Certain species of trees are used as bio-indicators because they add an
   additional temporal dimension.  By their growth rings, trees may reflect
   annual variations in metal concentrations in the environment.  In
   general, conifers are preferred because of the primitive nature of their
   wood which decreases the lateral transfer of contaminants between rings
   and, thus, gives them a better potential for the evaluation of
   environmental contamination.  The aim of this work is to evaluate black
   spruce (Picea mariana) as an historical indicator of Al deposition from
   the atmosphere.  The territory studied extends to a radius of 10 km
   around the Alcan aluminum refinery at Jonquiere, Quebec, Canada.  The
   sampling strategy was designed to determine the variability within an
   individual tree and to determine local and regional differences.  Using
   an incremental corer, xylem samples were taken from trees at six sites
   at 5 and 10 km from the refinery.  At each site, three samples were
   taken from each of five trees separated by 100 m.  The wood samples,
   containing from 30 to 50 rings, were sliced into two-year sections which
   were dried and analysed for Al by neutron activation.  This involved
   irradiation of each section in the neutron flux of a nuclear reactor
   followed by gamma-ray spectroscopy with a germanium detector.  The Al
   concentrations were thus determined in over two thousand xylem sections
   with a precision of 5\% at levels as low as 0.2-mu-g g-1.  The
   calculation of Kendall's tau for the Al concentrations in the three
   samples from each tree revealed correlations in 85\% of the trees from
   the four sites situated along the line of the prevailing winds from the
   refinery.  For the other two sites correlations were found in 40\% of
   the trees.  Higher Al levels were found in the growth rings of more
   recent years at all the sites.  At each site the inter-tree variations
   in the Al concentrations in wood of a given age were about 50\%.  Among
   the six sites, the lowest concentrations were found by an SNK test, at
   the two which were away fromn the line of prevailing winds from the
   refinery.  The highest concentrations were found at the site 10 km west
   of the refinery.  This site is also 5 km from a paper mill.  These
   results suggest that the trees most exposed to atmospheric contamination
   will contain high concentrations of Al.  However, the temporal
   fluctuations of Al concentrations have not yet been related to
   fluctuations in industrial contamination.  Moreover, the Al
   concentrations accumulated in the growth rings of black spruce could be
   related to the quantity of Al available in the soil, to the atmospheric
   release of NO(x) and SO(x) and to the natural pH of the soil which can
   induce chemical transformations, more particularly those related to the
   speciation and bio-availability of this metal.
   Although other variables must be taken into account, it appears that
   black spruce may be a useful historical monitor of environmental Al
   contamination once the relation between xylem concentration and
   atmospheric deposition is determined.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibians breed in a variety of aquatic habitats in the United States. 
   While the tolerance of low pH has been examined for many species of
   amphibians, those that breed in temporary ponds have been the most
   studied in terms of acidic precipitation.  Some of the latter have been
   shown to have lethal limits for low pH that are close to or above the
   pH's found in many breeding ponds.  Temporary ponds occur in large
   numbers in the areas of the country most affected by acidic
   precipitation.  Many of these ponds are susceptible to acidification and
   reduced reproductive success of sensitive species of salamanders has
   been observed in acidic ponds.  Additional practical and logistical
   considerations clearly make temporary ponds, and certain salamanders
   that breed in them, the best candidates for monitoring the long term
   effects of acidic precipitation on amphibian populations.  We recommend
   a cost efficient monitoring scheme across three categories of acidic
   temporary ponds (low, medium, and high) that incorporates (a) chemical
   analyses of pond samples, (b) a census of the annual deposition of egg
   masses, as well as assessment of embryonic mortality in enclosed and
   unenclosed egg masses in the ponds, and (c) sampling of larval success. 
   This plan offers the best opportunity for detecting changes in amphibian
   populations that are correlated with the acidity of precipitation, and
   would provide desperately needed long term data on the abundance of
   these amphibians.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1981-1983, yellow water-traps were used to study occurrence of
   some vegetable pests.  Determination was made of temperature thresholds
   for the flight of Ceutorhynchus quadridens (9.6-degrees-C), C. assimilis
   (14.6-degrees-C), Meligethes aeneus (10.2-degrees-C), Phyllotreta spp.
   (10.2-degrees-C), Athalia rosae (17.6-degrees-C), and Delia radicum
   (8.4-degrees-C).  A flight course of overwintering generations of adults
   of C. quadridens, C. assimilis and M. aeneus was expressed by a derived
   model based upon the sum of active temperatures for the flight.  A
   day-degree model proved the existence of three generations of A. rosae
   and D. radicum, the latter being characterised by regular aestivation in
   part of a population of the first summer generation.  Day-degrees are
   given to assess dates of adult occurrence and period of development of
   the respective generation.  The role of flight activity is discussed for
   the life cycles of the insect species under study as is the possibility
   of using yellow water-traps in practical pest control.}},

   males caught with funnel sex-pheromone traps in two stands of Abies alba
   and one of Cedrus atlantica growing in southern France was found to vary
   considerably within each of the three populations, as well as varying
   fairly considerably from one population to another.  The mean size of
   the males decreased quite steadily throughout the flight period, but the
   rate of this decrease varied from one population to another.  The
   representativeness of the males captured with sex-pheromone traps, the
   relationship between the respective variations in size in the males and
   females, and that between the size of the females and their fecundity
   are discussed.  It is concluded that the variations in the size of the
   trapped males in all probability reflected similar, sometimes
   considerable, variations in the fecundity of the females both within and
   among the three populations under investigation.  Measuring the size of
   male C. murinana caught in sex-pheromone traps seems to be a
   particularly useful indirect method for assessing populations'
   reproductive potential and the nutritional quality of the host plant. 
   The numerical trends of the three populations investigated were not in
   agreement with their respective reproductive potentials.  The
   nutritional quality of Cedrus atlantica seems to be lower than that of
   Abies alba.}},

   quantify the abundance of natural enemies in southern Europe; (ii) to
   assess the impact of natural enemies on C. pycnocephalus demography and
   (iii) to evaluate their potential efficacy for biological control.
   The three slender thistle populations monitored over a three year period
   remained stable.  Rosette mortality was low and density dependent above
   80 plants m-2.  ANCOVA of relationships between plant performance traits
   showed high plasticity within and among sites and years.  Only 1-12\%
   seed loss to insects and 0-2\% loss to pathogens was recorded.  The
   importance of arthropods versus pathogens in the population dynamics of
   C. pycnocephalus and in classical biological control is discussed.
   While more than 20 species of insect natural enemies were consistently
   recorded on slender thistles, none of these appeared to be a limiting
   factor on the host plant populations.  By contrast, a rust fungus,
   Puccinia cardui-pycnocephali, was observed to severely reduce plant
   vigour at 13\% of the sites surveyed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study reported in this paper was to investigate the
   dispersal of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles
   (Clethrionomys glareolus) between small woodlands in an agricultural
   landscape. By using live trapping and capture-mark-recapture methods,
   1017 wood mice and bank voles were trapped and 78 movements between
   habitats were monitored. The results demonstrate that hedgerows are
   important both for settlement and for corridors for dispersing small
   mammals. The study also tends to indicate that increasing distance and
   lack of hedgerows reduces the number of wood mice moving between
   woodlands, and that the degree of isolation may vary in time depending
   on the nature of the ground cover provided by the arable crop.}},

Abstract = {{During a long term study (10 years) of an increasing forest roe deer
   Capreolus capreolus (Linnaeus, 1758) population, the reliability of a
   kilometric index for monitoring population size was tested. Kilometric
   index was defined by the ratio ``number of observed animals/number of
   kilometers{''} of standardized transect. Three indexes were constructed:
   one for each transect, one for a transect set and one for all transects
   performed during a year. Actual population size was estimated each year
   by capture - mark - recapture. A modification of Petersen - Lincoln
   Index allowing long-term use was applied as the reference method. The
   relationship between annual kilometric index and population size
   estimation was assessed by calibrating index using linear and logistic
   regression. Moreover, we looked for different population levels using
   analyses of variance applied on the different indexes. Although high
   correlation was obtained between annual kilometric index and reference
   method, calibration equation led to unreliable population schedule. This
   demonstrated differential sensitivity of kilometric index according to
   population levels. Three population levels were discriminated by
   analyses of variance: a low population level during the four first
   years, a transition level corresponding to the fifth year and a high
   population level during the five last years. Indexes defined on a
   transect set (called ``photo{''}) appeared as the more informative. Such
   a study showed that to look for differential population levels from
   abundance indexes (bioindicator conception) is more pertinent than to
   establish conversion equations (calibration conception) in order to
   monitor forest roe deer population.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.), was monitored
   over three seasons in the field in an open-air fumigation experiment
   exposing cereal crops to elevated SO2 (mean levels 0.021-0.057-mu-l
   l-1).  In the first season winter wheat Triticum aestivum L. (cv.
   `Rapier') was grown, whereas in the following two seasons winter barley,
   Hordeum vulgare L. (cv. `Igri') was cultivated.  The results suggest
   that:  (1) the aphid population levels were enhanced by SO2 exposure;
   (2) natural enemy populations are not affected significantly by these
   SO2 levels, nor do they increase with enhanced prey levels.  Analysis of
   plant material suggests that changes in the food quality of the plants
   with respect to the aphids may be a factor causing enhanced aphid
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal dynamics of small mammal populations was studied in an
   isolated 2.6-ha woodlot surrounded by agricultural ``desert{''} in
   central Germany in 1984-88.  The CMR method with monthly live trapping
   was used in 1984-86.  In the autumn of 1986 all captured animals were
   removed and the recolonization of the woodlot was monitored until the
   spring of 1988.  The bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) and wood mouse
   (Apodemus sylvaticus) were dominant species in the woodlot.  Wood mice
   exhibited a seasonal habitat change between woodlot and field, together
   with the less abundant yellow-necked mouse (A. flavicollis).  The
   striped field mouse (A. agrarius) normally occurred in the forest in low
   numbers.  During high densities of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) on
   the surrounding fields it also penetrated the inner parts of the
   woodlot.  Contrary to expectation Clethrionomys was the most effective
   colonizer of the woodlot after the removal of rodents.  The sex ratio of
   Clethrionomys was 1:1 at all seasons, that of Apodemus-species
   male-biased during the autumn immigration.  The total densities of the
   rodent community were much higher during the autumn and winter than
   during the breeding season.  The number of shrews was very low during
   the entire study and these seem to have a poor ability to colonize
   isolated areas.  The study supports the idea of the importance of
   isolated woodlots in the agricultural mosaic, especially as
   overwintering refugies for rodents.}},

Abstract = {{A demographic monitoring study was initiated in the sole known
   population of Tetramolopium arenarium, a taxon that was considered
   extinct until recently rediscovered on the Pohakuloa Training Area,
   Island of Hawaii, Hawaii. Spatial distribution, size structures, fife
   history stage structure and reproductive output were determined for the
   population. This sole population is restricted to a 100 m by 300 m area
   along a mesic ridge system and is comprised of 134 individuals. Size
   class frequency distributions are bell-shaped with the population
   dominated by large individuals. In spite of large flower and seed
   production, interpretation of these distributions reveals that this
   species is either on the verge of extinction or that episodic
   establishment is necessary to ensure the long-term persistence of this
   rare taxon. In order to safeguard this species, we recommend that
   military operations and hunting activity be restricted and that the area
   be fenced to exclude feral animals.}},

   statistically significant differences were observed among sites for mean
   mass and numbers of bees (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.01), honey yield (P
   less-than-or-equal-to 0.07), and arsenic and cadmium content of forager
   bees (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.001). These findings are discussed in
   terms of exposure to heavy metals and observed changes in colony

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to observe the effects of polyacrylamide
   (PAM) additions on seed germination, nematode populations, and some soil
   physical properties.  A month-long greenhouse study was undertaken using
   0.2\% PAM in a coarse-silty, carbonatic, mesic Typic Heploxeroll seeded
   with Bromus tectorum.  Seedling emergence and plant biomass were
   monitored directly.  Nematode densities, bulk density, and penetrometer
   resistance were measured in conventional ways.  Soil water loss was
   measured gravimetrically.  Soil cracking was described by photographic
   means.  No significance was detected between treatments and controls in
   respect to seedling emergence, biomass, and water loss.  However,
   significantly greater penetrometer resistance was observed following the
   PAM treatments.  Greater nematode densities occurred in the controls, as
   did soil cracking.  PAM may, because of soil binding characteristics,
   restrict nematode activity directly or indirectly through other
   microflora and fauna they would feed upon.  Much more investigation of
   the effects of PAM on soil biotic components is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Growth, recruitment and mortality rates of a population of giant clams
   (Tridacna gigas and T. derasa) were monitored between 1978 and 1985 in a
   2.7 ha study area on Michaelmas Reef, Great Barrier Reef.  The initial
   1978 census revealed the presence of 1166 T. gigas and 44 T. derasa.
   For T. gigas, the Fabens method provided growth-parameter estimates of L
   infinity = 85.7 cm, K = 0.07 and t0 = 0.732 year.  The generated von
   Bertalanffy growth curve was a relatively poor fit to an empirical
   growth curve.  A better description of growth was obtained for younger
   clams by using a forced value of L-infinity = 80 cm, yielding K = 0.105
   and t0 = 0.145 year.  There was marked variability in the growth rate of
   individual clams, which has implications for the aquaculture industry. 
   Average annual mortality rates in two census intervals (1978 to 1980-81
   and 1980-81 to 1985) were 3.4 and 10.7\% respectively.  A comparison of
   the calculated size structure (assuming constant recruitment) with the
   observed size structure clearly suggested that recruitment was not
   constant and had declined drastically from a peak in the 1950s.
   For the much smaller population of T. derasa, the Fabens routine yielded
   estimates of L-infinity = 46.91 cm, K = 0.108 and t0 = 0.188 year.  The
   average annual mortality rate was 4.4\%.  Trends in recruitment could
   not be determined because of the small sample size.
   This study has highlighted the need for follow-up studies of this and
   other populations of giant clams if we are to understand more fully the
   processes of growth, recruitment and mortality in wild stocks and the
   implications for stock management and aquaculture.}},

   human impacts on the environment is a critical one. The usual
   community-level measures (species richness, diversity) generally have
   questionable theoretical justification, have no demonstrable causal

   available. Results from trampling experiments on an intertidal rocky
   shore demonstrate that these measures are also insensitive in detecting
   impacts that clearly affected populations of individual species. The
   need for experimental work that identifies which indicator variables are

Abstract = {{Biological effects of environmental impacts are usually defined
   simplistically in terms of changes in the mean of some biological
   variable. Many types of impact do not necessarily change long-run mean
   abundances. Here, designs for detection of environmental impact are
   reviewed and some of their shortcomings noted. New sampling designs to
   detect impacts that cause changes in temporal variance in abundance of
   populations, rather than their means, are described. These designs are
   effective at distinguishing pulse and press episodes of disturbance and
   could be used for other variables of interest (size, reproductive state,
   rate of growth, number of species, etc.) for monitoring. The designs
   require sampling different time-scales before and after a proposed
   development that might cause impact. Cases are discussed in which there
   is a single control location. Inadequacies of this approach for
   detection of environmental impact are mentioned, with some discussion of
   the consequences for management of impacts that cause temporal change
   rather than alterations of the mean abundance of a population.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological characteristics of island populations of the sleepy
   lizard, Trachydosaurus rugosus, were compared with those of three
   adjacent mainland populations in South Australia.  An analysis of 21
   morphological characters revealed greater divergence among the island
   populations than among those on the mainland.  However, in contrast with
   the findings of an earlier study using allozyme electrophoresis,
   morphological relationships among populations showed little congruence
   with the relationships expected from their geographic proximity.  Two
   measures of developmental stability (fluctuating asymmetry and
   percentage gross abnormalities) varied significantly among the
   populations.  High levels of developmental instability were observed in
   three of the island populations.  It is not possible to rule out
   environmental causes of the increased developmental instability but it
   appears more likely that it is caused by genetic drift and inbreeding
   resulting from small population size.  These results suggest that
   developmental stability may be more useful in monitoring genetic changes
   in wildlife populations than the conventional method of allozyme
   electrophoresis.}},

   of one year about 20\% of the N-15 remained as organic nitrogen in this
   layer. The percentage N-15 enrichment in ammonium and nitrate were in
   the same range in all the forest floor percolates, indicating that even

Abstract = {{Rates of reproduction and mortality undoubtedly vary across the ranges
   of most species.  Local demographic `sources', where reproduction
   exceeds mortality, may subsidize non-sustaining `sink' subpopulations,
   where local reproduction fails to compensate for mortality.  We examine
   model metapopulations of sources and sinks, connected by intrinsic
   dispersal of juveniles and density-dependent dispersal of adults or
   juveniles.  Results show that a large but finite proportion of the
   metapopulation might reside in non-sustaining subpopulations.  Although
   these demographic sinks are unable to persist independently, they may
   contribute significantly to metapopulation size and longevity.  Our
   analysis leads to several recommendations for the conservation of
   natural populations:  (1) demographically productive subpopulations need
   to be identified and protected; (2) conservation of buffer habitats and
   marginal subpopulations should be a part of comprehensive conservation
   plans; and (3) the long-term status of even seemingly secure
   metapopulations should be carefully monitored.}},

Abstract = {{The world's largest colony of the black-browed albatross Diomedea
   melanophrys on Steeple Jason Island, Falkland Islands was systematically
   censused for the first time in December 1987.  Colony area was estimated
   as 31.8 ha from high-altitude aerial photographs.  Densities of both
   occupied and empty nests were estimated from counts in 31 quadrats
   covering 2.2\% of the total colony area.  Combining the colony area and
   nest density estimates indicated a total of between 196 600 and 232 700
   nests, of which between 153 200 and 178 400 were occupied by breeding
   pairs over the hatching period.  These results confirm the importance of
   this colony, and of the Falklands as a whole, to the world population of
   this species and provide a baseline against which to assess future
   population changes.  Population monitoring is now essential as the
   foraging ecology of the albatrosses has been affected by the growth of
   commercial fisheries in Falklands' waters over the past decade.}},

Abstract = {{A conservative calculation of the number of albatrosses killed annually

   serious declines in albatross populations are due to this fishing
   activity.  Albatrosses have an economic impact on longline fisheries
   with annual losses to the southern bluefin tuna fishery alone exceeding
   \$A7 million.  If all fish species and the total longlining effort were
   considered, it would be many millions of dollars greater.  Apart from a
   concern for albatrosses, Japan's longline fishermen would also benefit
   by using the solutions offered.  It is suggested that a 70\% reduction
   in the problem is possible and that an overall reduction in excess of
   90\% could be achieved.  Further monitoring is essential.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for genetic interactions between hatchery and wild
   populations of salmonids in northwestern North America has increased
   considerably in recent decades.  Efforts to mitigate severe losses to
   many wild stocks caused by overfishing, destruction of habitat, and
   blockage of migratory routes have focussed on boosting artificial
   production in public hatcheries.  Opportunities for genetic interactions
   between hatchery and wild fish will increase if efforts to supplement
   wild production with hatchery-reared fish continue.  Concerns center on
   three issues:  (1) direct genetic effects (caused by hybridization and
   introgression); (2) indirect genetic effects (principally due to altered
   selection regimes or reductions in population size caused by
   competition, predation, disease, or other factors); and (3) genetic
   changes to hatchery stocks (through selection, drift, or stock
   transfers), which magnify the consequences of hybridization with wild
   fish.  Strategies for minimizing these genetic risks and monitoring the
   consequences of various management options are discussed, and some
   important areas for future research are identified.}},

Abstract = {{A white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) population living in a
   suboptimal habitat was monitored weekly throughout the year over a
   4-year period.  Data obtained were used to examine the hypothesis that
   populations living in suboptimal habitats are not self-regulating.  A
   total of 880 different mice were handled on 3023 occasions.  Population
   density fluctuated on both a seasonal and an annual basis, and
   differences in demographic structure among years included shifts in
   predominance of subadults versus adults, proportion of the population
   composed of juveniles, survivorship of males, and reproductive effort. 
   In general, the 2nd year was distinctive in that it was lower in
   density, dominated by subadults, had few juveniles, poor overwinter
   survival, and low reproductive effort.  A phase space plot of density
   against proportion of females breeding indicated that reproductive
   effort was being regulated in response to density, suggesting that this
   suboptimal habitat population was self-regulating.}},

Abstract = {{1.  Soil water potentials in natural nests of the Cuban iguana Cyclura
   nubila were monitored throughout incubation, and the energy stores of
   young iguanas from the nest were examined after hatching.  There was a
   strong negative correlation between \% yolk and \% fat (percentage of
   whole hatchling mass) in hatchlings demonstrating the conversion of yolk
   to fat during development.
   2.  The sizes of the carcasses (excluding yolk and fat) of hatchlings
   were not related to soil water potential of the nest.
   3.  However, hatchlings from drier nests had more yolk and less fat than
   hatchlings from wetter nests.
   4.  Inter-nest variability in soil water potential has previously been
   shown to influence the survival of hatchling Galapagos iguanas.  This
   study suggests that the mechanism by which soil water potential
   influences subsequent survival is through its effect on the amount of
   yolk that is converted into fat before hatching.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of lightly and heavily exploited Pacific ocean
   perch, Sebastes alutus, stocks are evaluated relative to the predictions
   of life history theory. These long-lived species (50-100 year lifespan)
   show limited phenotypic plasticity and have little buffering against the
   effects of reduced lifespan. Reduced stock abundance has generated some
   compensatory increase in growth rate. Length at first maturity varies
   only slightly with increased growth rate, although age at maturity may
   decrease by 1-4 years. Growth increases yield larger (15-20\%) size at
   age and increased reproductive effort at younger ages, but lower
   size-specific fecundity for these faster-growing fish. This suggests an
   energy allocation protocol favouring growth over reproduction in these
   long-lived animals. Rockfishes have late recruitment to fisheries (ages
   10-15), and the detection time for results of management actions is
   equally long. Their vulnerability to overfishing means that indices of
   population changes, more representative of fishing effects than the
   catch rate index presently used, are required. Reproductive value
   indices are shown to be extremely sensitive and continuous with
   population abundance changes. Their incorporation into monitoring
   programs would permit more timely evaluation of management actions.
   Management policies developed for shorter-lived species are shown to be
   inappropriate for rockfishes. The need for an improved match in the time
   frame of the species' life history, and that of management strategies,
   is stressed.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of early fetal losses (EFLs) in relationship to
   environmental agents offers unique advantages compared to other end
   points for hazard assessment.  There is a high incidence (> 20\% of all
   pregnancies end in an EFL), and the interval between exposure and end
   point is the short duration between conception and event, i.e.,
   approximately 12 weeks.  In contrast, cancer, which is the primary end
   point evaluated in risk assessment models, occurs with much lower
   frequency, and the latency period is measured in years or decades.  EFLs
   have not been used effectively for risk assessment because most of the
   events are not detected.  Prospective studies provide the only approach
   whereby it is possible to link exposure to EFLs.  Recent methodologic
   advancements have demonstrated that it is now possible to conduct
   population-based studies of EFLs.  It is likely that EFLs could serve as
   sentinels to monitor adverse health effects of many potential
   environmental hazards.  The methodology will be demonstrated using lead
   exposure in utero as an example.}},

   from one aspect of a continuing, multi-disciplinary, programme which
   monitors the disposal of acid waste to a liquid waste disposal area.
   The benthic infaunal populations of both the disposal and a control area
   have been studied over a five-year period.  The resulting data are
   analysed, using multi-variate techniques, and it is concluded that there
   is no evidence that disposal operations have altered the diversity or

Abstract = {{The microbial ecology of pristine and contaminated ground water at a
   chemical waste disposal site was investigated. Recently, it was
   determined that ground water downslope from the disposal site contained
   elevated levels of toxic pollutants, including benzene, toluene, xylene
   and methylene chloride, as well as iron and manganese. Microbial
   mineralization and uptake of radio-labeled glucose and amino acids
   indicated a metabolically active microflora in both pristine (upslope
   from the contamination) and contaminated groundwater samples collected
   from monitoring wells at the site. However, microbial uptake and
   mineralization of glucose and amino acids were up to fourfold slower in
   the contaminated well water than in the control well. Rates of
   mineralization and uptake of toluene were easily measurable in water
   from the contaminated well but were negligible in water from the
   pristine well, suggesting that the subsurface microflora in the
   contaminated region had adapted to degrade toluene. Additions of the
   inorganic nutrients N, K and P enhanced toluene mineralization in water
   from the contaminated well, with the addition of K and P enhancing
   mineralization twofold. The addition of these inorganic nutrients,
   therefore, presents an opportunity for biorestoration of the site. An
   increase in the incubation temperature also enhanced toluene
   mineralization; however, manipulations of pH and dissolved oxygen
   concentration had no measurable effects.}},

Abstract = {{Axenic batch cultures of freshwater algae were used to study the
   molecular, cellular and population effects of the organophosphorus
   insecticide fenitrothion on freshwater phytoplankton. The unicellular
   chlorophytes Chlamydomonas segnis, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Scenedesmus
   obliquus, Ankistrodemus falcatus and Selenastrum capricornutum were
   exposed to three treatment levels (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg/L) of
   fenitrothion. The monitored response parameters represent three levels
   of biological organization and included total cellular protein,
   carbohydrate, RNA and DNA levels, cell dry weight, cell volume, growth
   estimates and cell size distribution. Growth curves revealed
   differential algistasis among the species following 24 h exposure to
   fenitrothion, with induction of an extended lag phase in all cases.
   Levels of 10.0 mg/L elicited reductions in the maximum growth rate and
   standing crop of up to 62 and 96\%, respectively. Biomolecular
   indicators of phytotoxicity were manifested in the significant
   augmentation of macromolecular fractions. This biochemical accrual
   together with elevated dry weight and reduction in cell density was a
   common response pattern. It was postulated that fenitrothion prevented
   normal mitotic divisional processes from occurring. Uninhibited
   biomolecular synthesis resulted in an accumulation of macromolecules and
   subsequent cell weight augmentation. Modal cell volumes increased and
   normalized cell distribution spectra displayed a shift toward larger
   cells in treated algal populations.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of scent-marking by male and female aardwolves during the
   non-mating season in the northern Cape Province are described.  The
   distribution of scent marks conforms to predictions for marks being used
   as territorial advertisements.  Scent marks were concentrated around
   territory borders and were deposited at increasingly higher densities in
   smaller territories.  The data are used to re-examine existing
   hypotheses as to how scent marks function in territory maintenance. 
   Scent marks provide an olfactory association between the resident and
   the defended area, but I suggest that the message provided by this
   association may depend heavily on territory size, the frequency of
   territorial encounters and the defensive behaviour of the resident.  The
   greater the territory size and hence the difficulty in monitoring
   intrusions, the greater the threat transmitted by scent marks needs to
   be.  In most territorial carnivores, scent marks may be interpreted by
   intruders as a threat of immediate physical attack if encountered by the
   resident.  Thus scent marks help to maintain, but cannot ensure,
   territorial integrity in the temporary absence of the resident.}},

Abstract = {{In a population of about 1,300 Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus)
   living in one-male breeding structures at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India,
   census data resulted in male:female sex ratios of 1.1 in infants, 1.5 in
   juveniles and 0.2 in adults.  Long-term demographic monitoring of 144
   known individuals up to the age of 30 months confirmed a higher juvenile
   female mortality.  It is hypothesized that heavier maternal investment
   in males helps them to compete more successful.  Once males emigrate
   from their natal troop, their mortality begins to exceed that of
   females.  The strongly female-biased adult sex ratio seems to result
   from male-male competition:   maturing males join male bands and are
   exposed to greater risks while traversing unfamiliar areas, occupying
   home ranges of harem troops and fighting with other males for possession
   of a female harem.  A sample of 60 definitely known causes of deaths
   recorded over 21 years revealed that males died significantly more often
   than females in instantaneous `spectacular' deaths from external causes,
   such as accidents, infanticide and predation, thus reflecting a
   high-risk, high-gain strategy.  The sex difference in infanticide (18
   males:9 females for 13 directly observed and 14 presumed cases) is not
   well understood because the commonly accepted hypothesis is that new
   harem residents try to shorten a mother's lactational amenorrhea by
   killing her unweaned infant regardless of its sex.  However, it might be
   that harem residents select against future competitors of their sons and
   at the same time spare female infants with which they can reproduce if
   their tenure (mean:26.4 months) is long enough.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty years ago aerobiology concentrated on seasonal diffusion of
   phytopathic fungus spores and aeroallergens.  Subsequently, more divers
   approaches have been applied to problems with widely different organisms
   involved in the aerobiological pathway, including bacteria, algae,
   protozoans, and minute arthropods.  Aerobiology is used increasingly to
   gather biogeographic and ecological information, much of which is
   essential for conservation and environmental protection programs. 
   Biogeography compiles distribution records of indigenous and invading
   species initially, but aerosol monitoring is more efficient in detecting
   changes in range margins, which can be useful proxy indicators of
   environmental change and spread of species of special concern. 
   Aerobiology's contributions to ecology are numerous and diverse.  For
   example, adaptations of anemophilous flowers for entraining pollen
   grains within millimeters of stigmas, electrostatic charges given to
   spores released ballistically, and responses of charged particles to
   electric fields and charged surfaces in seasonally dry and truly arid
   environments are studied by aerobiologists.  At larger scales,
   monitoring of spores, pollen, and certain microbiota in aerosols can
   measure changes in phenology of source populations.  Evidence of
   environmental change is best measured when the sampling time intervals
   and the data points in a geographic information system net are adjusted
   to fit the questions being asked.  Identifying and tabulating aerosol
   particles are made more efficient by automated morphometric
   classification, counting, and size grading.  Fluorescent and
   multispectral microscopy will permit more precise identifications.}},

Journal = {{HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An outbreak of heather beetle Lochmaea suturalis on a wet heath in
   north-east Scotland was monitored.  In many respects, the outbreak was
   similar to those described in lowland heaths; it started at a particular
   locus and when the Calluna vulgaris was depleted, spread throughout the
   health.  Population size then decreased annually due to some
   undertermined exogenous factor.  A contributory factor may be the high
   incidence (35\%) of parasitoid infestation which is density independent
   and, thus, not controlling.
   There is no evidence that the hairiness of the var. hirsuta of Calluna
   has an effect on herbivory by Lochmaea.  The distribution of larvae
   through the canopy is neither influenced by the morphology of Calluna,
   nor by the associated species, and appears to be a random.  This
   probably represents the distribution of eggs since little lateral
   migration of the larvae takes place.
   The response of the vegetation to herbivory is not simple.  Associated
   with decreased cover of Calluna is an increase in Sphagnum plumulosum
   and Hypnum jutlandicum and reduction in S. compactum and Pleurozium
   schreberi.  Changes seem to depend on initial vegetation and other
   parameters not measured (e.g. proximity of propagules, microlimate). 
   Regeneration of Calluna does occur, largely by layering; although
   seedling occurrence increases in some areas, especially in Sphagnum, it
   seems unlikely that this will make a major contribution to the recovery
   of Calluna.}},

Journal = {{IBIS}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-8}},
Abstract = {{Most ecologist recognize the value of long-term studies to population
   and community ecology, and many also subscribe to the experimental
   approach as the most effective way of obtaining ecological knowledge.
   But if we are experimentalists, do we need long-term studies? I argue
   that the answer to this question is yes, that we must combine these two
   approaches to solve the major ecological questions of the next century.
   Most of the challenging questions facing ecologists involve systems
   subject to long-term time trends or high environmental variability.
   Because of the statistical power of many ecological methods, long-term
   studies are essential to measure time trends in ecosystems. Ignoring
   statistical power has been a major problem with short-term studies,
   which have predominated in the ecological literature.
   Some examples of long-term studies on larch bud-moth Zeiraphera diniana,
   winter moth Operophthera brumata and snowshoe hares are discussed
   briefly to illustrate the four major desiderata of long-term projects:
   spatial scale, sampling design, hypothesis testing and time-frame.
   Two reasons for not doing long-term studies are to assess
   density-dependence and to monitor ecosystem health. The
   density-dependent paradigm is bankrupt and has produced much argument
   and little understanding of population processes. Monitoring of
   populations is politically attractive but ecologically banal unless it
   is coupled with experimental work to understand the mechanisms behind
   system changes.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term population studies of birds in the United States have been
   less species-oriented and more concept-oriented than in Britain.  The
   demographics of North American species do not differ grossly from those
   of species elsewhere in the world, but polygamy has been relatively more
   frequently studied in U.S. species than elsewhere.  Subjects that have
   been particularly explored in long-term studies in the United States
   include the determinants of cooperative breeding in birds, the effects
   of the spatial scale on what is learned, and correlates of regional and
   national declines in bird populations.  Other areas of developing
   interest include the potential uses of monitoring data, the relative
   value of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies in analysing slow
   processes, and the significance of episodic events in shaping population
   patterns.}},

   CONSERVATION IN BRITAIN}},
Journal = {{IBIS}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-75}},
Abstract = {{Long-term studies are necessary in conservation work for two main
   purposes:  monitoring of population parameters, and defining habitat
   requirements to set targets for conservation action.  Apart from their
   intrinsic interest, birds may be of value also as a means of monitoring
   the wider environment.  Current developments include the integration of
   measures of breeding performance and survival with those of population
   size.  This will also aid early warning of changes.  The range of normal
   variation in these measures needs assessment to identify limits beyond
   which action is needed.  Monitoring studies need to be reported in
   appropriate habitat or geographical units, but cover as wide a
   geographical area as possible in a coordinated manner, to provide
   context.  Long-term studies are required for defining requirements, as
   needs may vary with overall population size, weather conditions, and
   other features which differ between years.  Population studies based on
   age-structures at a moment in time may not be a good approximation of
   the real performance as assessed by following age-cohorts through time. 
   This may be especially so in rare species.  For these, sample sizes also
   present problems in short studies.  Long-term studies may be required
   also to identify the needs of less obvious components of populations,
   such as immature individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Several long-running and geographically extensive survey programmes
   provide information used to make annual management decisions for North
   American waterfowl populations.  Data from these programmes can also be
   viewed as resulting from long-term population studies and have formed
   the basis for a number of retrospective analyses.  Short-term studies
   have been used to investigate mechanisms underlying results of the
   retrospective analyses.  Results of the long-term and short-term studies
   complement each other nicely and have led to many useful inferences
   about North American waterfowl population dynamics.  However, important
   questions remain unanswered, and it is suggested that many of these

Abstract = {{The Common Birds Census documents changes in the populations of the more
   abundant British land birds.  Here we analyse the CBC data for various
   English passerines to discover the separate effects of weather and of
   density-dependent feedback on their annual population changes.  Density
   dependence is generally apparent in the data from woodland plots, less
   so in those from farmland.  There are clear effects of weather,
   particularly in farmland.  Prolonged snowfall in winter reduces
   populations of most species; frost and low temperatures appear much less
   important.  Rainfall in March and April increases numbers censused in
   the spring but this may be an artefact.  We discuss ways in which
   analyses such as these should be taken forward.
   We consider whether this work is respectable science, arguing that
   monitoring through the CBC goes much further than mere surveillance of
   numbers, that such monitoring is important in wildlife management, and
   that density dependence is not a bankrupt paradigm.  Long-term data
   gathering is an essential part of ecological science, even in programmes
   not designed at the outset to test specific hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{A short review of effects of eutrophication on the phytobenthic
   communities in the Baltic Sea is given. Future monitoring aspects are
   briefly discussed. Local changes in phytobenthic communities outside
   point sources (e.g. industry outlets, enclosed bays receiving effluents
   from land runoff etc.) are easily detected and can be due to nutrient
   enrichment and/or toxic substances. In recent decades, changes have been
   reported from apparently unaffected areas. The disappearance of Fucus
   vesiculosus is the most conspicuous. The cause of events is similar in
   those areas: increases in epiphytes give increases in grazer
   populations. The thallus of algae is heavily grazed upon. The epiphytes
   shade their host and filamentous algae compete for space, disturbing
   recruitment and leading to a decrease in diversity. The rapid response
   of opportunistic filamentous algae on nutrient enrichment and changing
   herbivore pressure can easily be observed. Therefore, repeated
   surveillance in defined areas, which integrates the environmental
   response in both animal and plant communities, may be a fruitful
   approach for detecting large scale eutrophication of the Baltic Sea.}},

Abstract = {{A site for intensive population-genetic, ecological pathology and other
   studies of the wild tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum var.
   dicoccoides) was set up at Ammiad, Eastern Galilee, Israel. The
   objective of the study was to gain basic scientific information on a
   variable and representative population of this annual selfing wild
   cereal, the progenitor of durum and bread wheats, in the centre of its
   local distribution. The information gathered was to aid the
   rationalization of in-situ conservation and sampling practices. An area
   of grassland on terra-rossa soil overlying Eocene hard limestone was
   chosen because of its heterogeneous topography, rock micro-relief and
   plant species composition, which promised a diversity of habitats. Based
   on an in-depth ecological survey, the site could be divided into four
   major habitats and eleven subhabitats. Environmental variation was also
   caused by wide differences in annual totals and distribution of the
   Mediterranean winter rainfall. In the years 1984 to 1989, plants were
   monitored at closely spaced permanent sampling points along four
   topographically diverse transects. Single-spike seed collections were
   made at each point annually, and progenies from these collections were
   distributed for parallel ex-situ studies of different traits of the
   phenotype and genotype.}},

   evaluation of the inhalation risk to workers and to the general

   workers, into respirable and extrathoracic subfractions (Soderholm,

   These data have been taken as specifications for the design of a

Abstract = {{In South Africa, red scale (Aonidiella aurantii {[}Maskell]) males and
   several of its Aphytis Howard parasitoid species, were monitored using
   sticky yellow card traps, each with a rubber septum impregnated with
   synthetic female red scale sex pheromone.  Traps were exposed in 72
   different orange (Citrus sinenis {[}L.] Osbeck) orchards in 3 different
   areas and were changed weekly during two seven-week periods in winter
   and early summer.  Correlations between the maximum weekly numbers of
   trapped red scale recorded during each period were significant at P =
   0.10 only in the coldest area where A. melinus DeBach was not recovered
   and where winter oil treatments were applied.  Summer trap catches of
   Aphytis spp. were depressed by all spray programmes for citrus thrips
   (Scirtothrip aurantii Faure) including tartar emetic plus sugar.  Trap
   counts of Aphytis were significantly (P < 0.05) lower after a single
   triazophos (0.024 \% AI) treatment than after a single fenpropathrin
   (0.006 \% AI) treatment.  No correlation between the maximum number of
   trapped red scale in summer and fruit infestation at harvest was
   significant at P = 0.10, presumably due to variable impact from Aphytis
   spp.  Prediction of expected red scale fruit infestation at harvest and
   the development of a treatment threshold based on numbers of trapped red
   scale were therefore not possible.}},

Abstract = {{A population of the burrowing wolf spider Geolycosa turricola in
   Mississippi was monitored over a period of 4 years.  Weekly censuses of
   the number of burrows that were active, open but not active, or inactive
   were taken.  The timing of the dispersal of spiderlings was examined by
   use of caging experiments.  A habitat manipulation experiment was used
   to assess burrow site preferences.  This population reproduced on a
   2-year cycle; no young were produced in even years.  The results suggest
   that some dispersing spiderlings construct burrows immediately after
   leaving their mother's burrow while others overwinter and build their
   first burrow during the spring.  Two dispersing groups are identified
   and are shown to have different survivorship properties.  The importance
   of this dispersal strategy in terms of subsocial behavior is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Sex pheromone traps were used to monitor the seasonal periodicity of the

   Results indicated a seasonal progression of movement by fall armyworm
   from the southern most locations in the United States into Canada. 
   Although the fall armyworm survives throughout the year in the Caribbean
   Basin, analysis of moth capture and meteorological data for the region
   provided no direct evidence that this reservoir of continuous
   populations contributed contributed significantly to the influx of this
   pest into the temperate regions of North America where it normally does
   not survive the winter.  Weather disturbances along the Atlantic
   seaboard of the northeastern U.S. and Canada in October 1984 and an
   associated precipitous decline in moth captures in pheromone traps
   supports a previous hypothesis of a return (southward) migration by fall

Abstract = {{The patterns of abundance of molluscs in sediments at One Tree Reef,
   southern Great Barrier Reef were determined for three adjacent habitats
   in October 1985:  a shallow subtidal sandflat, a deep channel, and the
   sloping, unstable edge separating the two.  Deposit-feeding cerithiid
   gastropods, especially Rhinoclavis aspera (Linnaeus, 1758), R. fasciata
   (Bruguiere, 1792) and R. vertagus (Linnaeus, 1758), were the most
   abundant molluscs present but these species were predominantly found in
   the coarse sandy sediments of the sandflat.  The abundances and sizes of
   these three species were monitored seasonally from October 1985 to
   January 1988 on the sandflat.  Densities fluctuated during the three
   years of the study and varied at a number of spatial scales.  The
   density of R. aspera was generally greater at the beginning of the year,
   after recruitment, then gradually declined until the next period of
   recruitment.  This pattern was not as evident for R. fasciata or R.
   vertagus.  Changes in size-frequency distributions through time suggest
   that movement of animals, either by migration and/or passive transport
   in the shifting sediments may contribute to the observed patterns. 
   Comparisons are made between temperate and tropical soft-sediments
   habitats, especially in relation to the distribution of deposit-feeding
   organisms.}},

   composition also differed among habitats, with complex sites supporting
   a greater proportion of older fish (> 1 + yr). The relative importance
   of recruitment and postrecruitment processes in determining these
   patterns was evaluated by monitoring the abundance, survival, growth and
   movement of two separate cohorts of juveniles in habitats of different
   complexity. The demographic data were based on records of individually
   recognised fish monitored from time of recruitment in permanent
   quadrats. Despite high temporal and spatial variability in the intensity
   and distribution of recruitment between years, adult F. varium were
   highly dependent on early postrecruitment mortality. Greater rates of
   early juvenile mortality were experienced within habitats of low
   complexity. The greatest impact of mortality in structuring spatial
   patterns occurred within the first week after settlement. Seasonal peaks
   in movement may have partially contributed to changes in patterns of
   distribution between habitats. The effects of habitat on growth were
   less clear, although there was a trend for growth to be better within
   habitats of high topographic complexity. The effect of topographic
   complexity on survivorship of juveniles was examined using a
   manipulative experiment which increased the complexity of simple
   habitats and reduced the complexity of heterogeneous habitats.
   Recruitment occurred roughly evenly across all treatments. Low
   complexity treatments suffered 100\% mortality compared to only 13\% in
   high complexity treatments. The demography of natural populations and
   the subsequent experiment suggest that differences in the abundance of
   adult F. varium between habitats can be attributed essentially to the
   early failure of juveniles to survive in large numbers in low complexity
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{We test two hypotheses to explain the success of a biological invader in
   marshes on the Pacific coast of North America. The first hypothesis
   focuses on the competitive superiority of an invading species over
   native species; the second hypothesis focuses on the absence of
   ecological equivalents in the aboriginal biota, such that no competitive
   interactions are necessary to facilitate successful invasion. As a model
   system we experimentally manipulated the introduced pulmonate snail
   Ovatella myosotis and the native prosobranch snails Assiminea
   californica and Littorina subrotundata. Manipulations included pair-wise
   enclosures to determine if Ovatella depressed the growth of the native
   species; pair-wise associations to determine whether or not snails
   demonstrated negative or positive clustering; removal experiments to see
   if native snails invaded regions occupied by Ovatella, and reciprocal
   transplants on a vertical gradient to determine the physiological
   breadth of the target species. In addition to monitoring population
   abundances of all three species seasonally, dietary overlap of these
   three gastropods was also examined. No evidence of competitive
   superiority by Ovatella was found. Ovatella possesses the physiological
   capacities to exist in a semiterrestrial environment and is therefore
   able to take advantage of resources unavailable to native gastropods. We
   conclude that the successful establishment of this Atlantic snail in the
   Pacific Northwest did not arise at the expense of native species.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling frequency and methods can potentially affect estimates of
   demographic rates in population studies. To determine the effects of
   various sampling protocols on estimating recruitment rate, the rate of
   larval settlement by the coral reef damselfish Dascyllus albisella Gill
   to an experimental grid of coral heads was monitored over several
   intervals by either removing newly settled larvae (recruits) at each
   census, or not. By sampling every 5 h during two 24-h periods, it was
   found that most recruits (75\% on Day 1 and 81\% on Day 2) settled
   between dusk and dawn. Coral heads that already supported conspecific
   juvenile groups attracted more recruits than empty coral heads during
   both 24-h periods, although this was statistically significant on Day 2
   only. Subsequent tagging of recruits from 1 to 19 days after settlement
   revealed that movement between coral heads was negligible after the 1st
   day postsettlement, but apparent mortality was high over the same
   period. The settlement rate of larvae to the coral grid during a 19-day
   period was estimated by employing three protocols of census frequency
   and recruit removal. This suggested that frequent sampling with recruit
   removal would most closely estimate true settlement rate for D.
   albisella and probably other species, while less frequent censuses
   without recruit removal may provide closer estimates of the size of the
   recruit cohort that will enter the juvenile population. Considerable
   variation exists in the sampling protocols used by researchers studying
   settlement rate in damselfishes and I caution against directly comparing
   results among these studies.}},

Abstract = {{A regression model was used to determine the trend in time and the
   effects of sampling site, age, and weight on DDE, PCB, mirex, dieldrin,
   chlordane, and mercury concentrations in lake trout from Lake Ontario
   from 1977 to 1988.  The model allows the use of the entire data set
   collected by the Canadian Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans
   monitoring program for lake trout in this lake up to 1988, and provides
   estimates of logarithmic mean concentrations in each age group
   independent of the overall (across all ages) contaminant:body size
   relationship.  Mercury concentrations decreased steadily during the
   study period with a half life of 11 years.  DDE concentrations decreased
   rapidly from 1977 to 1980 but then remained relatively constant.  Mirex
   concentrations generally decreased, but with much year-to-year
   variation.  Dieldrin concentrations decreased from 1978 to 1988, but
   chlordane concentrations remained relatively constant.  PCB
   concentrations decreased from 1977 to 1981, increased in 1982 until
   1984, and decreased again in 1985.  The overall trend in PCB
   concentrations was a gradual decline with a half life of roughly 10
   years.  Deviations about this trend were closely related to the rate of
   growth of the alewife population, a principal food of lake trout,
   suggesting that food web interactions play an important role in
   regulating PCB concentrations in lake trout.  Lipid concentrations in
   lake trout also decreased from 1977 to 1988, complicating interpretation
   of the time trends in the lipid soluble organic contaminants.  PCB, DDE,
   and mirex concentrations in trout increased from east to west in Lake
   Ontario.  All contaminant concentrations increased with increasing age
   and body size, but the body size effect was less within an age class
   than across age classes.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed function oxidases (MFO) are a family of inducible enzymes which
   oxygenate natural and synthetic chemicals alike, making them amenable to
   conjugation and excretion.  The utility of MFO induction in white
   suckers as an indicator of chemical contamination was examined in three
   ``areas of concern,{''} Jackfish Bay, St. Marys River, and the
   Kaministiquia River.  MFO determinations in spawning suckers suggested
   no induction, although white suckers captured in the summer from
   Jackfish Bay had MFO levels up to 6 (2,5-diphenyloxazole metabolism) and
   7 (Benzo-a-pyrene hydroxylase) fold higher than did reference suckers. 
   Similar induction was found in suckers collected in the summer from the
   Kaministiquia River and from the St. Marys River, hepatic MFO activities
   3 (PPO) and 5 (BaP) times those of the reference populations suggesting
   exposure to chemicals with MFO inducing potential.  The relative
   induction of hepatic MFO at all three polluted locations is a sensitive
   measure of industrially discharged xenobiotics, which might be useful in
   monitoring the efficiency of remedial action plans.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of Pratylenchus scribneri populations was
   monitored under irrigated corn and potato grown in loamy sand soil. 
   Population estimates were based on the number of nematodes recovered
   from 100-cm3 soil samples and the roots contained therein.  Reproduction
   was assessed by counting the number of second-stage juveniles.  An index
   of population maturity was computed to evaluate the age structure of
   populations.  At no time were nematodes distributed uniformly among five
   soil depths from 0 to 37.5 cm deep.  During the summer (June-September),
   changes in the total number of P. scribneri and the number of
   second-stage juveniles recovered were not consistent among the depths
   sampled.  Early (April-June) and late (September-November) in the
   season, changes in the abundance, reproduction, and maturity of
   populations were similar among depths.  The timing and pattern of
   increases in numbers of nematodes suggests that variation in the
   abundance of P. scribneri in the soil profile beneath potato and corn
   was caused primarily by reproduction rather than the movement of
   nematodes.}},

Abstract = {{During a normal growing season, sweetpotatoes shed a substantial number
   of leaves (Somda and Kays, 1990b).  To ascertain the potential cost of
   leaf loss to the plant, the sequential loss of leaves over the entire
   growing season was monitored and related to losses of dry matter and
   individual elements when leaf shedding was induced via leaf shading. 
   The number of leaves produced increased as the season progressed, but
   missing leaves outnumbered by 21\% those remaining on the plant by the
   end of the growing season.  Average dry weights of individual leaves
   increased progressively to a maximum 14 weeks after planting, and then
   declined until harvest.  After the 6th week, leaf area decreased
   relative to plant dry weight for the remainder of the growing season. 
   Mature leaves remobilized nearly 37\% of their total dry matter prior to
   abscission; the remaining 63\% was lost from the plant, representing an
   estimated dry matter loss of approximately 2.8 MT/ha during the growing
   season.  A significant portion of P, K, and Mg that had accumulated in
   mature leaves was recycled into the plant prior to abscission.  However,
   remobilization of Ca, Fe, Zn, Mn, B, Na, and Al was not significant. 
   Leaf shedding in field populations of `Jewel' sweetpotatoes was
   extensive, and while significant dry matter was recycled out of the
   leaves prior to abscission, leaf drop represented a substantial loss of
   P, K, and Mg and dry matter from the crop.}},

   lures in traps for monitoring beetle populations.  A second component of
   the pheromone (T2:  1-methylethyl(E,E)-2,4-dimethyl-2,4-heptadienoate)
   has recently been identified.  Experiments were carried out to compare
   mixtures of T1 and T2 with T1 alone and to determine the effective lives
   of the pheromone lures under local storage conditions.  More beetles
   were caught in traps containing pheromone mixtures than those containing
   T1 alone although significant differences could not be shown between any
   of the mixtures tested.  It was concluded that the current monitoring
   system could possibly be improved by using a mixture of T1 and T2 as the
   pheromone lure.  T1 was released faster from the vials than T2, but at
   least 19\% of each component remained after 2 weeks exposure.  It is
   however recommended that lures are renewed every two weeks when used
   with the P. truncatus trap.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial patterns of activity of free ranging Indian crested porcupines
   (Hystrix indica) in the coastal plain of Israel (Mediterranean region)
   were monitored for 21 months, by radio telemetry and by direct
   observation.  The mean weight of captured porcupines was 13.9 kg and a
   density was found of 4 porcupines per km2.  Home ranges of three pairs
   and four solitary males were defined, in an area of dense human
   population, including transportation lines, agricultural and natural
   areas.  A difference in size of home range of the pairs was found
   according to their habitat:  Two pairs in agricultural areas had a
   home-range of about half the size of that belonging to a pair that
   inhabited a natural area (0.375 km2, 0.487 km2, vs. 1.215 km2).  During
   the daytime the pairs remained in their dens, emerging at sunset. 
   Throughout their nocturnal activity both partners remained close to each
   other.  The porcupines dug for geophytes or foraged on agricultural
   crops at a certain spot in their home range, returning towards dawn to
   the same den that they had left in the evening.
   The movement pattern of a solitary male differed from that of pairs.  It
   was active for a limited period in a sub home range and then wandered
   around (up to 8 km), defining an additional sub home range.  When a
   solitary male found a female partner, they established a pairbond and
   demonstrated the same spatial pattern described for pairs.
   Other differences between pairs and solitary males were found in the
   choice of shelter sites and in walking distances.  Couples remained only
   in underground shelters during the day, while solitary males also used
   surface shelters (dense shrub, etc.).  Average distance travelled per
   night was shorter for a pair than for solitary males (1 684 m vs. 2 310
   m).  A paired porcupine did not invade another pair's home range, but
   the activity of solitary males in a pair's home range might indicate
   that these males are not territorial.  Temperature, humidity, rainfall
   and moonlight did not influence the movement pattern of the porcupines
   in the Tel Aviv area.
   The present findings concerning the porcupines in the coastal plain of
   Israel are discussed and compared to porcupines in the desert area of
   Israel, and to populations elsewhere in Asia and to other species of
   porcupines.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction and development of the ophiuroid Ophionereis olivacea H. L.
   Clark, a species that broods its young, were investigated in Florida
   from January through December 1985 and in Belize in June 1985 and April
   1986. O. olivacea has a maximum disc diameter of 5.2 mm and is a
   protandric hermaphrodite. Sex reversal occurs at disc diameters ranging
   between 2.2 and 4.0 mm; it has 400-mu-m diameter oocytes and is
   ovoviviparous. As expected from an obligate out-crosser, this ophiuroid
   has a similar allocation to male and female reproduction, in terms of
   gonad volume. Reproduction of the Florida population was monitored for
   one year. O. olivacea is a sequential brooder and incubates its young
   during the coldest months of the year. The females produce a single
   clutch of juveniles each year. Spawning starts in November and peaks in
   January and February. The ova are spawned synchronously from all the
   ovaries of each female into the bursae and are retained there.
   Fertilization is accomplished by intake of sperm into the female bursae.
   O. olivacea develops through a ciliated embryonic stage that appears to
   be a modified vitellaria larva lacking ciliary bands. These modified
   larvae swim in seawater in the bursae. Direct development in this
   species has resulted from heterochrony in the loss of ophiopluteus
   features. The number of brooding females in the population increases in
   November and reaches a maximum in March. Juvenile O. olivacea emerge
   from the bursae at a disc diameter of 480-mu-m and each arm has three
   segments. Recruitment was first detected in April, and juveniles were
   particularly abundant in June. Small size in O. olivacea is associated
   with paedomorphic heterochrony with precocious maturation of the males
   at a disc diameter of 1.5 mm, approximately 2 mo after taking up their
   free existence. Brooding as a life history mode in O. olivacea is
   examined and the adaptations of this species to its warm-water habitats
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In 1983/1984, Diadema antillarum suffered mass mortalities throughout
   its West Atlantic range. Its populations were reduced by 95\% and
   subsequently have failed to recover. These die-offs led to sustained
   increases in the abundance of soft algae, including types eaten by
   herbivorous reef fishes. I monitored adult populations of three
   herbivorous surgeonfishes (Acanthurus coeruleus, A. chirurugus and A.
   bahianus) between 1978 and 1990, and the recruitment of their pelagic
   juveniles between 1979 and 1989, on six patch reefs in Panama. Adult
   populations of A. coeruleus and A. chirurgus, which largely restrict
   their feeding to reef substrata, increased by averages of 250 and 160\%,
   respectively, after the die-off of D. antillarum in 1983. No increases
   occurred in the adult populations of A. bahianus, which often feeds in
   off-reef habitats unaffected by D. antillarum. Average annual levels of
   juvenile recruitment of all three surgeonfishes did not differ before
   and after the die-off. These results support the hypothesis that adult
   populations of two herbivorous fishes that are strongly reliant on reef
   algae for food previously were limited by competition with D.
   antillarum.}},

Abstract = {{Damselfish neurofibromatosis (DNF) is a cancer affecting bicolor
   damselfish (Pomacentrus partitus) on reefs in South Florida, USA.
   Bicolor damselfish exhibiting DNF were observed on 18 of 19 reefs
   surveyed, with prevalence rates varying from 0.4 to 23.8\% of the adult
   fish in these populations. These rates were very stable over 5 to 9 yr
   periods (1981 to 1989) on the two reefs monitored. High disease
   prevalence was associated with a high population density of large
   size-class fish and a population structure dominated by large fish.
   These patterns were observed both between and within reef populations.
   The distribution of cases within reefs was clustered rather than uniform
   or random. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that DNF is
   distributed primarily via fish to fish (horizontal) transmission of an
   infectious agent. Disease patterns are not consistent with what would be
   expected to result from inherited (or vertically transmitted) or
   water-borne agents.}},

   all these stations temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen,

   coliforms and E-coli have been measured in the water column with
   seasonal frequency. There is a general trend in water pollution
   increasing from south to north and from the open sea to the rivers
   estuaries. This reflects the pollutant loads from human population in
   the northern region and from rivers flow. Mathematical modelling of the
   transport and fate of pollutants in the bay is reviewed. The use of the
   models in analysing various combinations between the choice of the
   disposal site and the degree of sewage treatment is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In Helsinki, on 22 March 1974, the governments of the countries in the
   Baltic region signed an agreement on cooperation in the protection of
   the marine environment - ``Convention on the Protection of the Marine

   Convention. This gives rise to international cooperation comprising
   scientific research, changes in national legal and organizational

   In Poland, inhabited by almost half of the population in the Baltic Sea
   drainage area and which uses almost 40\% of the arable land of the
   region, the effects of the activities undertaken are of considerable
   importance for the ecological situation of that sea.
   The paper presents, on the example of one of coastal provinces - the
   Gdansk province and the Gulf of Gdansk - the problems of the land - sea
   interaction, the activities undertaken in monitoring the coastal marine
   waters, the pollution loads discharged from land sources, implementation
   of international commitments as well as the results of these activities

Title = {{COLONIZATION OF BIOFILMS BY BACTERIA CAPABLE OF BIODEGRADING SODIUM
   DODECYL-SULFATE (SDS) AT CLEAN AND POLLUTED RIVERINE SITES}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm formation on presterile slate-discs placed at a pristine source
   site and at three polluted sites located upstream from, at, and
   downstream from a sewage-works outfall in a South Wales river, was
   monitored over 14 days.  Viable bacterial cell densities in biofilms
   increased with time at all sites but more rapidly at the polluted sites,
   and stabilized after 1-4 days at levels equal to those of stones
   indigenous to the corresponding sites, and similar to those seen in
   other comparable pristine and polluted rivers.  Biofilm cell densities
   were elevated about 1,000-fold at the sewage works outfall compared with
   the site immediately upstream.  Downstream from the outfall, the cell
   densities were intermediate between the upstream and outfall values. 
   Epilithon resuspended from the slates during colonization was tested for
   its capacity to biodegrade the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)
   in die-away tests.  No biodegradation of this common pollutant was
   observed for the samples from the pristine source.  In contrast, even
   after only 1 day, all polluted sites produced samples capable of
   biodegrading SDS.  Longer exposure in the river led to more rapid onset
   of biodegradation in the die-away tests, indicating an adaptation
   mechanism(s).  Die-away kinetics were fitted by computerized non-linear
   regression analysis to one of several models.  The model of best fit
   involved biodegradation of SDS by a bacterial population growing at the
   expense of endogenous carbon.  The regression parameter reflecting
   SDS-degrading activity of the epilithic samples increased markedly
   during Days 0-4 for all three polluted sites.  The stabilized values
   (Days 4-14) increased from the upstream site to the outfall, then
   decreased to intermediate values downstream.  Although this pattern
   corresponded to the changes in viable cell numbers, the effect of the
   sewage input was less marked for the SDS-degrading activities than for
   bacterial cell densities.  In addition, there was little variation in
   growth characteristics throughout colonization at all three polluted
   sites.  Collectively the results indicate that the observed adaptation
   during exposure in the river is attributable to colonization of the
   epilithon by an existing SDS-degrading population, rather than the
   acquisition or adaptation of this biodegradative capability.}},

Abstract = {{Aphid honeydew on wheat leaves can affect host physiology directly and
   can stimulate infection by necrotrophic pathogens.  The role of
   naturally occurring saprophytes on wheat flag leaves in removing aphid
   honeydew was examined in five field experiments at different locations
   in the Netherlands in 1987 and 1988.  Aphid populations, saprophyte
   populations and aphid honeydew were measured weekly.  Diseases were
   monitored at 1-4 week intervals.
   In the control treatment, sprayed with water, the naturally occurring
   saprophytes consumed the honeydew almost completely, except in one
   experiment in which the aphid population increased very rapidly.  In the
   treatments in which the saprophytes were reduced by the broad-spectrum
   fungicide maneb in 1987 and with maneb alternated with anilazin in 1988,
   honeydew accumulated.  The observed honeydew consumption by the
   naturally occurring saprophytic population is ascribed mainly to pink
   and white yeasts (Sporobolomyces spp. and Cryptococcus spp.,
   respectively).
   Additional treatments showed, that in the presence of the naturally
   occurring saprophytes the yield loss per aphid-infestation-day was lower
   than when the saprophytes were inhibited by fungicides, showing that
   yeasts can reduce the detrimental effect of aphid honeydew in wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive activities of Vespula pensylvanica (Saussure) were studied
   on the recently invaded (1978) islands of Maui and Hawaii.  Aspects of
   reproductive behaviour were inferred from the use of attractant traps to
   monitor foraging worker and queen populations, observations of
   architecture and traffic rates of nests, and dissections of queens
   occupying active nests or captured while foraging.  Most wasp colonies
   adhered to the basic annual cycle dominant throughout V. pensylvanica's
   native temperate range.  Atypical overwintering colonies, indicated by
   at least one episode of large cell construction and a subsequent
   reversion to small cell construction, occurred on both islands, but were
   detected in only some years.  Overwintered colonies had peak traffic
   rates in excess of 300 worker sorties per minute, but some large annual
   colonies also had traffic rates greater than 300 per minute.  Flying
   queens were most abundant during the spring (March-June), but were
   captured in every month except January.  Among autumn queens taken from
   nests on Hawaii, oviposition-ready queens were more common than
   hibernation-ready queens, suggesting that winter hibernation is not
   obligatory.  Polygyny, achieved by adding queens to an established
   colony, is a likely prerequisite for successful colony overwintering. 
   Two gyne-addition mechanisms are proposed for this:  retention of
   daughter queens, and joining by outside queens.  Expression of V.
   pensylvanica reproductive plasticity is correlated with relaxation of
   climate-related constraints.  Relaxation of genetic constraints is also
   hypothesised to contribute to the emergence of polygyny in Hawaiian
   Island populations.}},

Abstract = {{The parasitoid Sphecophaga vesparum (Hymenoptera:  Ichneumonidae), has
   been released throughout New Zealand in an attempt to control introduced
   common (Vespula vulgaris) and German wasps (V. germanica) (Hymenoptera: 
   Vespidae).
   The parasitoid overwintered and has probably become established at
   Pelorus Bridge, 25 km east of Nelson.  In 1990, an infested nest was
   recovered 7.1 km from this release site, indicating that the parasitoid
   can disperse at least 2.37 km per year.  However, the proportion of
   nests parasitised at Pelorus Bridge has increased only slightly in the
   first 3 years after release.
   No Sphecophaga were recovered from 1190 nests at 38 other sites where
   they were released and monitored.  This may reflect the small number of
   parasitoids that emerged at some sites, the small number of nests
   inspected at others, or a low parasitoid population density.  However,
   combined data from this and other studies suggests that the parasitoid
   is having difficulty in becoming established in many areas.  It is still
   too early to assess whether the parasitoid will disperse widely, or
   reduce wasp numbers significantly where it does become established.}},

Journal = {{OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{409-486}},
Abstract = {{The methodology for analysis of marine mammal diets may be thought of as
   a series of choices; about the sampling regime, the type of sample, the
   processing of samples, the identification of prey remains, the
   quantification of prey importances, and the estimation of population
   food consumption. In addition to directed sampling, samples may be
   obtained indirectly or opportunistically and the most frequently used
   types of sample are gut contents of dead animals, and faeces. Direct
   observation of feeding may be possible for species living close inshore,
   and humane approaches to sampling (e.g. lavaging) have been successfully
   applied to seals, but all methods are subject to bias. Identification of
   fish prey usually relies on recognition of otoliths, but additional
   information may be obtained from other hard remains or serological
   analysis of proteins. Remains of invertebrate prey may also be
   identified from hard parts. A variety of methods exist for quantifying
   the importance of prey in marine mammal diets. The most useful currency
   is probably prey biomass but, for fish, natural variation in otolith
   size-fish weight relationships makes it difficult to estimate fish
   weights from otolith size. Also, otoliths are reduced in size or lost
   during digestion. Notwithstanding these problems, otoliths are widely
   used. If the diet of a population has been adequately characterised, the
   amounts of each prey type consumed may be derived from direct or
   indirect estimates of energy requirements. Ideally the measurements
   should be taken in the field. Possible improvements in methodology
   include improved calibrations for otolith measurements, the development
   of keys and guides to fish bones, and of serological methods for
   identifying fish proteins. Feeding is normally inferred rather than
   directly monitored and a means for remote detection of prey ingestion
   and defaecation would greatly enhance the interpretation of foraging
   activity. To predict diet choice it is necessary to understand the
   underlying behavioural mechanisms. Measurement of the energetic costs of
   prey capture would be an important step in this direction.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater snails and anuran tadpoles have been suggested to have their
   highest population densities in ponds of intermediate size where abiotic
   disturbance (e.g. desiccation) is low and large predators absent.  Both
   snails and tadpoles feed on periphytic algae and, thus, there should be
   a large potential for competitive interactions to occur between these
   two distantly related taxa.  In a field experiment we examined the
   relative strength of competition between two closely related snail
   species, Lymnaea stagnalis and L. peregra, and between L. stagnalis and
   tadpoles of the common frog, Rana temporaria.  Snail growth and egg
   production and tadpole size at and time to metamorphosis were
   determined.  Effects on the common food source, periphyton, were
   monitored with the aid of artificial substrates.  Periphyton dry weight
   was dramatically reduced in the presence of snails and/or tadpoles. 
   There were no competitive effects on growth or egg production of the two
   snail species when they were coexisting. Mortality of L. peregra was
   high (95\%) after reproduction, but independent of treatment.  Growth of
   L. stagnalis was reduced only at the highest tadpole densities, whereas
   egg production was reduced both by intraspecific competition and by
   competition with tadpoles.  Differences in egg production were retained
   after tadpole metamorphosis.  Tadpole larval period increased, weight of
   metamorphosing frogs decreased and growth rate was reduced as a function
   of increasing tadpole density.  However, contrary to expectation, snails
   had a positive effect on tadpole larval period, weight and growth rate. 
   Further, in experimental containers without snails there was a dense
   growth of the filamentous green alga Cladophora sp.  We suggest that the
   facilitative effects of snails on tadpoles are due to an ``indirect
   mutualistic{''} mechanism, involving competition between food sources of
   different quality (microalgae and Cladophora sp.) and tadpoles being
   competitively dominant over snails for the preferred food source
   (microalgae).  In the presence of tadpoles snails will be forced to feed
   on low-quality Cladophora, increasing nutrient turnover rates, which
   results in enhanced productivity of microalgae, increasing tadpole food
   resources.  Thus, tadpoles have a negative effect on snails through
   resource depression, while snails facilitate tadpole growth through an
   indirect enhancement of food availability.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-dispersal seed predation of the leguminous Acacia farnesiana by
   Mimosestes nubigens and M. mimosae (Coleoptera:  Bruchidae) was
   investigated in Santa Rosa National Park, northwestern Costa Rica.  The
   purpose of the study was to determine the patterns of resource
   utilization by the seed predators and the mechanisms causing such
   patterns.  Immature, mature, and fallen fruits were monitored during the
   dry seasons of 1987 and 1988 from different shrubs and areas. 
   Parameters describing plant size, fecundity, and relative plant
   isolation were measured on each shrub.  No evidence of spatial or
   temporal segregation was found between the two species and the intensity
   of seed predation was independent of the variables measured from each
   plant.  M. mimosae was scarcer and always occurred with M. nubigens. 
   Both were present in areas with low and high densities of the host
   plant, and the frequency distributions of their emergences from the
   fruits overlapped through the fruiting season.  Urosigalphus sp., a
   hymenopteran parasitoid, represented ca. 40\% of all insect emergences
   in 1987 and ca. 30\% in 1988.  This wasp attacked a greater proportion
   of bruchid eggs on pods on the shrub than on pods beneath it, and more
   on green than on mature fruits.  Parasitism thus appears to select
   against bruchid females that oviposit at an early stage of pod
   maturation.  The harsh conditions of the dry season, namely heat and
   desiccation, also accounted for a high level of bruchid pre-emergence
   mortality, especially in fallen fruits, where survival from egg to adult
   was only about 18\%.  Beneath the shrubs, bruchid females exhibited
   selectivity, ovipositing more on pods in the shade than on those exposed
   to direct sunlight.  In contrast to parasitoids, abiotic factors
   probably impose a selective force against those bruchid females that
   oviposit at a late stage of maturation or on pods already dropped.  Both
   bruchid species can have more than one generation during the fruiting
   period.  The intensity of seed predation did not, however, change during
   the season.  The data obtained in this study suggest that factors like
   natural enemies and severe weather are more likely to limit the bruchid
   population densities than intra- or inter-specific competition.}},

Abstract = {{Development of spruce shoot aphid (Cinara pilicornis Hartig) populations
   was monitored in natural and artificial infestations of Norway spruce
   (Picea abies Karst.) seedlings, exposed to air pollutants in an
   experimental field.  The pollutants, applied both singly and in
   mixtures, were gaseous sulphur dioxide, NaF (30 mg l-1 F) and Ca(NO3)2
   or (NH4)2SO4 in aqueous solutions (200 mg l-1 N).  Aphid numbers on 10
   seedlings in each treatment and two control plots were counted at
   2-weeks intervals.  At the beginning of the experiment aphid numbers did
   not differe between treatments.  Aphid populations peaked in late June
   and early July.  All the pollutants and their combinations significnatly
   increased the numbers of aphids per seedling.  Four apterous females
   were transferred to spruce seedlings which were growing in containers in
   the same plots.  After 4-5 weeks aphid numbers were significantly higher
   in the fluoride treatment and in the combined treatment of fluoride,
   nitrogen and SO2.  The pollution treatments did not have a significant
   effect on shoot growth.  Concentrations of F and S in needles were
   higher in treatments involving these pollutants.  There were no
   significant differences in the concentrations of free amino acids in
   shoot stems between control and fluoride treatment.  However, the
   relatively low concentration of arginine in the F treatment at the end
   of the growing season might indicate disturbances in the nitrogen
   metabolism of spruce seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{The earthworm Lumbricus rubellus was studied in the laboratory to
   determine its effect on decomposition and nutrient mineralization in
   simulated coniferous forest floor. The control systems had a diverse
   soil fauna including the earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra. Special
   attention was paid to the effects of the mineral soil horizon on soil
   processes. CO2-evolution was monitored; and nutrients in the leaching
   water were measured. The systems were destructively sampled twice;
   numbers of animals, pH, contents of organic matter and KCl-extractable
   nutrients were analysed separately from organic and mineral soil
   horizons.
   L. rubellus affected the mineralization of nitrogen positively and also
   enhanced nitrification. The presence of L. rubellus led to decreased pH
   in the leaching water (even more than 0.5 pH-units). Owing to earthworm
   mortality, the influence of worms on the soil processes studied
   diminished over time. Leaching of PO4 - P through mineral soil was
   extremely low.
   Animals other than earthworms increased their numbers until the first
   destructive sampling, after which they decreased. The enchytraeid
   Cognettia sphagnetorum was especially abundant at the first sampling,
   when its biomass was even larger than that of the earthworms
   (enchytraeid biomass was smaller when L. rubellus was present than when
   it was absent). Enchytraeids influenced soil processes, especially
   CO2-evolution. The other earthworm D. octaedra grew and reproduced well
   in both the absence and in the presence of L. rubellus.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies carried out over two years in Meaford and Trenton, Ontario
   showed that synthetic volatile lures increased apple maggot (AM),
   Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh), catches on traps consisting of a yellow
   panel plus two red spheres by two to four times, compared to traps
   without lures. Traps baited with Consep(R) or Ladd(R) lures usually
   caught AM flies earlier in the season and when AM populations were low
   compared to unbaited traps. Ninety percent of the AM flies caught were
   on the red sphere part of the trap. More sensitive traps and improved
   treatment thresholds should increase the confidence in the AM monitoring
   system.}},

Abstract = {{A survey is being carried out in Cambridge with the aim of measuring the
   total-body burden of a number of gamma emitting radionuclides. 
   Cambridgeshire was chosen for the survey for its low natural and
   artificial background radioactivity in order to provide a baseline for
   other, similar surveys around the country.  Cs-137, Cs-134 and K-40,
   radon daughters, thorium daughters and certain nuclides used in nuclear
   medicine and radiobiology have been observed.  The site has a very low
   radon level and hence we are in a position to measure the body burden of
   radon daughters in or on volunteers.  Over 1050 volunteers have already
   been measured and with large numbers from the same population; accuracy
   can be achieved by combining the results from a large sample, giving
   much improved statistics.  The statistical validity of deductions based
   on this large population sample will be discussed together with the
   relevance of the work to attempts to establish baseline data on the body
   levels of radioactivity from the population.}},

Journal = {{REVIEWS IN AQUATIC SCIENCES}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{339-373}},
Abstract = {{Responding to a national ``Americanization{''} policy, the groundfish
   fishery off Alaska developed rapidly after the 200-mi EEZ was
   established in 1976.  This transformation was characterized by (1) rapid
   expansion in the domestic groundfish fishing fleet, permitting the U.S.
   to supplant a major foreign fisher; (2) creation and rapid growth of a
   foreign high seas fishery in the Bering Sea ``doughnut hole{''}; (3)
   extensive shifts in domestic fishing patterns, especially from longline
   and small-scale trawling to large-scale groundfish trawling, and from
   shore-based fisheries to at-sea processing; (4) new requirements for
   domestic, at-sea fishery monitoring and surveillance capability; (5)
   growing evidence of overcapitalization in the fishing fleet; and (6)
   growing concern that commercial fishing may be implicated in the rapid
   decline of marine mammal populations.
   The two fishery management plans prepared in accordance with the
   Magnuson Act address the need for biological conservation of groundfish
   resources and provide the structure for achieving Americanization.  Now,
   other Federal resource management objectives need to be addressed. 
   These include economic efficiency, equity in distributing the economic
   benefits from the fishery, conservation of marine mammals and other
   wildlife affected by commercial fishing, and formation of an
   international conservation regime for fish stocks straddling the EEZ and
   high seas ``doughtnut hole{''}.  The North Pacific Fishery Management
   Council continues to explore and evaluate limited access systems which
   address the economic issues, but has yet to implement an effective
   program.  With seriously declining populations of northern sea lions,
   fur seals, and harbor seals, fishery managers need to reconcile the
   production-oriented concerns of fishery management with the conservation
   of noncommercial resources.  Finally, effective management of the
   largest single groundfish resource, walleye pollock in the Bering Sea,
   will require extensive international cooperation and management.}},

Abstract = {{Population levels of Ips typographus in 8 Danish forest districts were
   monitored by pheromone traps and baited trees in 1988 and 1989. The
   number of trees with spontaneous colonization was also registered. All
   monitoring results were below earlier defined ``risk thresholds{''}, and
   accordingly no serious damage was found. Mean catch ranged from 3406 to
   12043 beetles per trap group, and induced colonization averaged 1.08
   trees per tree-baiting site. Trie number of colonized trees (total
   infestation) ranged from 3.5 to 63.2 trees per 100 ha forest.
   Correlation was found between mean catch and induced colonization
   (r=0.56), and between induced colonization and total infestation
   (r=0.65). Accumulated data from 1988-89 and 1984-86 showed good
   correlation between catch size and number of infested standing trees
   (r=0.91). From 1988 to 1989 no significant changes occurred, apart from
   a shift in host material from standing trees to windfalls and timber. I.
   typographus monitoring on regional levels is possible also under
   non-epidemic conditions. With a limited number of monitoring units,
   trapping, tree-baiting and registrations of infestation in exposed edges
   can give estimates sufficiently accurate to be of practical use to local
   foresters.}},

Abstract = {{Frequencies of mice with the rat growth hormone (rGH) transgene were
   examined in lines derived from two genetic bases (P/W and P/C). The
   genetic bases were developed from males (P) with the rGH transgene,
   mated with non-transgenic females of different origin: a line previously
   selected for large body size (W) and a corresponding unselected control
   line (C). They were maintained for six generations under random mating
   with or without selection for increased 42-day body weight. The
   frequencies of P/W and P/C males with the rGH transgene wer 0.075 and
   0.300, respectively at generation 0 of the genetic bases. They were
   significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the expected frequency (about 0.5).
   At generation 6, the frequencies had decreased further both in selected
   and unselected lines (ranging from 0.025 to 0.125). Decreased
   frequencies of mice with the transgene were confirmed in a separate
   experiment testing segregation of the transgene. The reasons for these
   decreases are not clear. The results suggest that transgenes need to be
   monitored when transgenic animals are mated with animals of different

   plant {[}ACP] populations) and F2 plants generated from six F1 hybrids
   of rice, including five japonica upland/improved indica tropical
   hybrids.  The alleles in excess at some loci displaying skewed
   segregations in the F2s were consistently overrepresented in the NMC
   populations.  These alleles were also generally found to be overabundant
   in the two ACP populations except for certain loci that contrastingly
   segregated in a 1:1 ratio.  Additional distortions were found to be
   specific to AC derivatives indicating the existence of in vitro gametic
   selection.  Overall, however, the gametic selection in the ACP materials
   was neutral with regard to the indica and japonica differentiation. 
   Estimates of linkages between markers borne by chromosome 6 using
   AC-derivative data were consistent with those noted in the F2s and with
   current knowledge of the isozyme locus linkage map.  Given the average

Abstract = {{In February 1989 an outbreak of waterborne cryptosporidiosis associated
   with contaminated surface water in the upper Thames catchment was
   identified.  Less than 0.01\% of the population suffered symptoms
   sufficient for them to seek medical advice.  Nevertheless, the impact of
   the outbreak on the community and the water undertakers was
   considerable, and an expert committee was appointed by the Secretary of
   State for Health to advise on research and measures to control the
   disease and prevent future waterborne outbreaks.  One of the committee's
   interim recommendations was for the gathering of information on the
   occurrence of cryptosporidium oocysts in the aquatic environment
   particularly source used for abstraction and production of drinking
   water.  The results of monitoring in the River Thames catchment will be
   discussed particularly in light of observations that peak contamination
   events occur in rivers which pass through agricultural land but do not
   receive discharges from sewage treatment works.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the population and authorities in West Germany have
   become very concerned with water pollution.  In this respect, combined
   sewage discharges have been pointed out as a major source.  Various
   measures can be considered, which can be ordered into three categories: 
   a redefinition of the objectives of the Urban Drainage System (UDS), the
   reshaping of the UDS (e.g. extension of the storage capacity) or the
   modification of its operation.  Among the latter measures, Real-Time
   Control (RTC) constitutes the main option.  It aims at a better
   exploitation of the existing storage potential.  As the city of Bremen
   (Germany) decided, several years ago, to renew the on-line survey and
   monitoring system of its UDS, the determination of on-line strategies to
   operate the pumps came to the fore.  Methods and tools to investigate
   the possibility to reduce the pollution loads through improved control
   strategies have been developed.  Some results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial isoprenoid quinones were used as tools for studying the
   bacterial community structure and population dynamics in photosynthetic
   sludge in a full-scale plant and a laboratory batch reactor.  Both
   ubiquinones and menaquinones were detected from all sludge samples, at
   concentrations of 428 to 886 and 170 to 456 nmol/g (dry weight) of
   sludge, respectively.  Smaller amounts of rhodoquinones were also found
   in all sludges.  Either ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) or Q-8 was the predominant
   ubiquinone in the main treatment zones of the plant, while Q-10
   predominated in the laboratory sludge.  The meanquinone composition of
   the sludges was more complicated than the ubiquinone profiles recorded.
   The plant and laboratory sludges contained menaquinone-9 (MK-9) and
   MK-10, respectively, as the major menaquinone.  Bacteriological
   examination revealed the occurrence of high numbers of the purple
   nonsulfur bacteria in the photosynthetic sludge reactors.  All strains
   of the phototrophic bacteria isolated from the sludges contained Q-10 as
   the sole quinone.  These results suggest that Q-10 may be used as a
   biomarker of the phototrophic bacterial population, while other
   ubiquinones, menaquinones, and rhodoquinones may be useful for
   monitoring the population dynamics of co-existent chemoheterotrophic
   bacteria in the photosynthetic sludge process.}},

Abstract = {{The eastern barred bandicoot, Perameles gunnii, formely occurred widely
   in Victoria and Tasmania.  Because it is endangered in Victoria,
   clarification of its conservation and taxonomic status in Tasmania is
   important.  We observed the distribution and relative abundance of
   Perameles gunnii in nine localities in Tasmania.  Comparisons of
   trappability in three localities sampled in March 1985 and
   October-November 1989 showed no decline in relative abundance.  P.
   gunnii were more abundant in November 1989 than on two previous
   occasions at one location.  However, six other localities where P.
   gunnii were abundant in 1985 showed little evidence of P. gunnii
   activity in 1989.  Spotlighting and trapping efforts, together with
   anecdotal information, suggest a decline in the status of P. gunnii in
   the Tasmanian Midland region.  The reduction of these populations could
   be a feature of normal demographic fluctuation or could be indicative of
   a real decline in the status of P. gunnii.  Long-term studies to monitor
   seasonal and annual abundance changes in Tasmania would be useful for
   the management of the dwindling Victorian population, and are needed to
   fully determine the status of Tasmanian populations for conservation and
   management purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal movements of 22 Pteropus poliocephalus, from two maternity
   camps in north-eastern New South Wales, were monitored from January to
   June 1989 using radiotelemetry. The animals moved independently in time
   and space among various communal roosts located 8-610 km from the
   maternity camp sites. Generally, P. poliocephalus from a camp near
   rainforest (Currie Park, Lismore) remained within 50 km of the maternity
   site. These localised movements were attributed to the continued
   availability of fruits in the rainforest throughout the study. Animals
   from a maternity camp surrounded by sclerophyll forest (Susan I.,
   Grafton) undertook long migrations south (median distance 342.5 km, n =
   11) to camps containing up to 200 000 P. poliocephalus of both sexes.
   These large aggregations formed during the mating season and comprised
   individuals drawn from various previous sites. Thus, P. poliocephalus in
   northern and central N.S.W. appear to function as a single breeding
   population and should be managed as such. After mid-May, animals from
   Susan I. returned to north-eastern N.S.W. There was high correlation
   between movements of P. poliocephalus from the camp at Susan I. and the
   flowering patterns of certain species of Myrtaceae and Proteaceae. It is
   hypothesised that flowering attractive to apiarists is also attractive
   to P. poliocephalus and that information from apiarists could be used by
   wildlife managers to predict large aggregations of the animals.}},

Abstract = {{Mouse populations were monitored at 15 sites between 1980 and 1990,
   during which time one severe mouse plague, in 1980, and one minor
   outbreak, in 1984, were recorded. Smaller annual peaks in autumn to
   early winter were followed by winter population declines. Crops were
   colonised each year in late winter or early spring by mice from winter
   refuge habitats with dense, low vegetation, including roadsides and
   grassland along a railway line. In most years mouse numbers in crops
   declined during summer, but in 1983-84 they rose continuously during
   summer and autumn, and reached very high levels. Crops planted in 1984
   were invaded by large numbers of mice which had survived through winter
   in the paddocks, but population levels again crashed in late spring and
   summer. Recorded population changes were generally consistent with
   plague probabilities predicted from environmental variables, except in
   1985 when numbers failed to reach the predicted high levels at most
   sites. Population changes in crops during late spring appear to be
   critical in the development of mouse plagues. Large litter sizes and
   pregnancy rates, and variable survival rates and size of the breeding
   population, appear to be important factors at that time.}},

Pages = {{741-760}},
Abstract = {{The movements of a population of feral cats (Felis catus) were monitored
   on New Zealand farmland over three years by means of radiotelemetry. The
   number of resident males on the 5.2-km2 study area varied from 5 to 9,
   averaging 1.34 per km2, compared with 10-13 females, averaging 2.19 per
   km2. The average density over three years was 3.47 cats per km2.
   The nocturnal home range was significantly larger than the diurnal home
   range in both sexes. Adult female's home ranges overlapped considerably;
   adult males tended to occupy exclusive home ranges or territories with
   little overlap, but including those of several females. Adult males and
   females that used barns as den sites were mainly nocturnal and had
   larger home ranges than females denning in vegetation.
   Females showed no consistent change in home-range size with season,
   although those breeding in barns had larger home ranges in summer. Adult
   males had larger territories in summer and winter. Dispersing subadult
   males had a similar home range to adult males. Death or disappearance of
   a dominant male allowed new males to occupy the vacated territory. Two
   subadults were tracked by day until they became adult and acquired
   territories within the study area.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of large herbivores on the structure and composition of the
   woodlands in the Seronera Valley, Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, was
   reassessed in 1982 by updating an earlier survey by Croze (1974). 
   Species composition, stand structure and the type and extent of browse
   damage were recorded in 22 open woodland stands dominated by Acacia
   tortilis, in association with Commiphora trothae, A. clavigera, A.
   senegal, or Albizia harveyi, and in eight riverine forest stands
   dominated by A. xanthophloea.  Tree density ranged from 32 +/- 2 to 363
   +/- 25 trees ha-1, and from 17 +/- 1 to 118 +/- 7 trees ha-1 among open
   woodland stands and riverine forest stands, respectively.  Interstand
   differences in the frequency of damaged trees were a function of both
   species composition and population structure, but were independent of
   stand density.  The relative frequency of occurrence correlated closely
   with the relative frequency of damage for each species, and a chi-2
   distribution showed that only A. senegal was significantly preferred,
   while only C. trothae and A. clavigera were significantly avoided.
   The destruction of mature trees by elephants, and the intense browsing
   pressure on recruitment-sized trees by giraffes have significantly
   decreased the proportion of mature trees in the Seronera Valley over the
   past two decades.  During the 10-year period prior to 1982, the
   frequency of mature A. tortilis and A.  senegal trees greater than 5 m
   in height decreased by 70\% and 89\%, respectively, with an average
   annual mortality rate of 5\% for mature A. tortilis trees.  A comparison
   with Herlocker (1973) suggests that the density of A. tortilis in the
   valley in 1982 was approximately 41\% less than that of similar
   communities in the region 10 years earlier.  The density of A.
   xanthophloea in the Valley, and the frequency of large A. xanthophloea
   trees along the Seronera River declined by approximately 30\% over this
   same period.
   Elephants within the Serengeti National Park have been poached to their
   lowest numbers in thirty years.  Although the rate and direction of
   future woodland change in the Seronera Valley will be affected by
   unpredictable, recurrent elephant use, the frequency and intensity of
   fire, and the browsing pressure of giraffes are likely to be the most
   important factors.  Accurate assessment of the impacts of these, and
   other factors on woodland regeneration has been hindered by the lack of
   comparable data describing these woodland communities.  We believe that
   this data set used in conjunction with diligent monitoring of existing
   fire-management programmes will be essential to the understanding of
   long-term changes in vegetation structure in this ecosystem.}},

   a species assemblage (D.  galeata, D. hyalina, and galeata x hyalina

   Scenedesmus.  Responses are monitored using genotypes at the Pgm and Got

   exhibited relative increases in enclosures receiving algae while hybrids
   underwent steady increases in enclosures both with and without algae
   added.  These results are in part consistent with the argument that
   slight differences in resource utilization exist among the Daphnia
   species considered here and that these differences are swamped by

Abstract = {{Under good growing conditions, juvenile Atlantic salmon metamorphose
   into the migratory smolt stage at 1+ or 2+ years of age.  The
   life-history decision on whether or not to migrate at 1+ years is made
   in July-August of the previous year.  After this time, populations
   develop a bimodal size distribution, the larger fish (upper modal group)
   being the 1+ smolts and the lower modal group being fish that will smolt
   at 2+.  Fish of high social status are more likely to become 1+ smolts. 
   We examined the causal nature of this relationship by manipulating
   status within a laboratory population of sibling fish.  The absolute
   status of individual fish was estimated within 2 weeks of first feeding.
   Relative status was then manipulated by dividing the population into
   two, half containing the fish with the highest absolute status (high
   ranking) and the remaining half of fish of lowest absolute status (low
   ranking).  The status of individually marked fish was then determined
   within each of the two groups.  Individual growth rates were monitored
   until smolting strategies were apparent.  There was a complete overlap
   in the sizes of subsequent upper and lower modal group parr in early
   June, but from late June onwards fish in the upper modal group grew
   faster.  The high- and low-ranking groups did not differ either in mean
   growth rates or in the proportions of fish adopting the alternative
   smolting strategies.  However, they differed in the factors that
   influenced an individual's developmental strategy:  within the
   high-ranking group, relative social status in June was a significant
   predictor of whether a fish would smolt aged 1+, whereas length at that
   time was not.  In contrast, no relationship between status and smolting
   strategy was found in the low-ranking group, where differences in status
   were less clear-cut and had less influence on growth.  Instead, age of
   smolting could be predicted from early growth rate.  These results
   demonstrate that the influence of status on smolting depends on the
   extent to which fish of high status suppress the growth of those lower
   in the hierarchy.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity is presently a minor consideration in environmental policy.
   It has been regarded as too broad and vague a concept to be applied to
   real-world regulatory and management problems.  This problem can be
   corrected if biodiversity is recognized as an end in itself, and if
   measurable indicators can be selected to assess the status of
   biodiversity over time.  Biodiversity, as presently understood,
   encompasses multiple levels of biological organization.  In this paper,
   I expand the three primary attributes of biodiversity recognized by
   Jerry Franklin - composition, structure, and function - into a nested
   hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of
   organization:  regional landscape, community-ecosystem,
   population-species, and genetic. Indicators of each attribute in
   terrestrial ecosystems, at the four levels of organization, are
   identified for environmental monitoring purposes.  Projects to monitor
   biodiversity will benefit from a direct linkage to long-term ecological
   research and a commitment to test hypotheses relevant to biodiversity
   conservation.  A general guideline is to proceed from the top down,
   beginning with a coarse-scale inventory of landscape pattern,
   vegetation, habitat structure, and species distributions, then
   overlaying data on stress levels to identify biologically significant
   areas at high risk of impoverishment. Intensive research and monitoring
   can be directed to high-risk ecosystems and elements of biodiversity,
   while less intensive monitoring is directed to the total landscape (or
   samples thereof).  In any monitoring program, particular attention
   should be paid to specifying the questions that monitoring is intended
   to answer and validating the relationships between indicators and the
   components of biodiversity they represent.}},

Abstract = {{During the last 30 years, changes in the size of Hawaiian monk seal
   populations at several locations have been associated with the amount
   and type of human disturbance.  Recreational beach activities caused
   monk seals to alter their pupping and hauling patterns.  Survival of
   pups in suboptimal habitats was low, leading to gradual population
   declines.  During the last decade at Kure Atoll, the process has been
   reversed:  human disturbance on beaches has decreased, and traditional
   pupping and hauling sites have been reestablished.  Subsequently, high
   survival rates of young seals, coupled with two successful enhancement
   programs for female pups, have led to dramatic changes in the age and
   sex composition of the population.  Based on these changes, the monk
   seal population at Kure Atoll soon should begin to increase. Apparently
   small behavioral changes in such vital activities as feeding and
   reproduction can have large demographic consequences.  Therefore,
   monitoring of endangered species should include data on habitat use and
   age and sex composition, as well as estimates of abundance.}},

Abstract = {{A population of Ambystoma talpoideum was monitored from 1977-1982 using
   mark-recapture techniques to document changes in population parameters. 
   Body size differed significantly between the sexes; males had longer
   body lengths than females, females and greater masses than males, and
   males had longer cloacae than females.  Sex ratios varied significantly
   from 1:1 during two of the 5 yr studied, and a shift toward more males
   was noted.  Annual fecundity was 57-504 eggs/female based on oviducal
   and ovarian counts.  Population natality was estimated to be 2555
   eggs/year.  Mature females were larger (snout-vent length) but
   oviposited fewer eggs than females from South Carolina.  Clusters of
   3-50 eggs were deposited within thin, clear jelly envelopes; single eggs
   were not found.  Annual, biennial, and other reproductive cycles
   occurred, but most individuals (68\%) were annual breeders.  Growth
   rates declined logarithmically after hatching.  Sexual maturity occurred
   at 2 yr of age, and the onset of reproductive senility occurred in the
   fifth year of age in females and in the seventh year of age in males. 
   Breeding population size ranges, for three of the years studied, were
   131-214 females and 177-220 males/year, and declines were indicated. 
   Adult mortality rate was estimated to be 25.8\% per breeding season, and
   longevity of more than 8 yr was documented.}},

   pronounced shift from phenotypes of C. t. tigris to C. t. gracilis
   across a distance of only 16 km.  A sample from the center of this
   transition area contained two discrete classes of specimens, (1) a group
   phenotypically intermediate to the two putative parental forms and (2)
   representatives of C. t. tigris.  The presence of an intact parental
   phenotype from the center of the zone suggested the presence of an
   impediment to introgression.  Nevertheless, individuals with
   recombinations of the dorsal and ventral color patterns of the two
   parental forms provided evidence of hybridization throughout the 41 km
   sampling transect.  Free range expansion of the relatively small
   population of C. t. tigris is effectively blocked to the west, north,
   and east by physiographic features, and impeded to the south by
   suboptimal habitat and the population of C. t. gracilis.  This provides
   an unusual opportunity to monitor the vulnerability of the phenotype of
   C. t. tigris to assimilation into a hybrid group.}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal and seasonal variations in numbers of nonbreeding Great Skuas
   Catharacta skua on Foula, Shetland, were monitored during the 1975,
   1976, 1988 and 1989 breeding seasons.  The accuracy and use of daytime
   and night-time counts are compared.  All nonbreeders spend the night at
   clubs and most go to sea to feed in early morning.  Hence, night-time
   counts represent total numbers of nonbreeders attending the colony,
   whilst daytime counts are more variable, although consistently timed
   afternoon counts can provide useful diurnal and seasonal comparisons. 
   The mean number of nonbreeders attending the colony between May and
   August was significantly less in 1988 (732 individuals) and 1989 (662
   individuals) than in 1975 (approximately 1949 individuals).  This
   decline in numbers of nonbreeders since the mid-1970's coincided with a
   decline in the breeding population over the same period, although
   nonbreeding numbers decreased much more (breeders by 8\% from 1975 to
   1989, nonbreeders by 57\%).  Numbers of nonbreeders at the colony
   correlated with seasonal changes in diet that appeared to indicate
   changes in food availability.  A reduced afternoon attendance by
   nonbreeders in 1989 (40\%), compared with 1976 (67\%), reflected
   unusually poor Great Skua breeding seasons on Foula in 1988 and 1989. 
   Numbers of nonbreeders attending a colony appear to be good indicators
   of environmental changes that could usefully be added to current seabird
   monitoring programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Ten of the 11 extant Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres colonies in the
   Transvaal were censused using aerial and/or ground census techniques in
   the 1980-1985 breeding seasons. Minimum counts were obtained and best
   estimates of total numbers of ``active nests{''} were determined using
   correction factors to compensate for incomplete photocoverage in the
   aerial technique and nest failures prior to the census dates. In 1985,
   the year when the most complete data were available, a minimum of 2741
   and a best estimate of 2987 active nests were determined to be present
   in the Transvaal. At the large colonies, which were intensively
   monitored, breeding numbers did not fluctuate greatly from year to year,
   and it is thus estimated that about 3 000 pairs of birds bred yearly in
   the Transvaal during the study period. Although the data indicate that
   the total numbers are greater than previously thought this is due to
   improved census techniques, rather than an increase in the population.
   Ninety-eight percent of breeding occurred at six colonies and 82\% at
   three (Kransberg, Blouberg and Manutsa). The large colonies are
   associated with communal grazing (homelands), private cattle and game
   farming and nature conservation areas, where the use of poison for
   predator control is minimal. The vulnerable status afforded the Cape
   Vulture in the South African Red Data Book - Birds (Brooke 1984) is
   justified because of the bird's disappearance from some breeding
   colonies, reduction in numbers at others and its vulnerability to
   poisoning.}},

Abstract = {{Although there has been an extensive literature on phenotypic plasticity
   in Scenedesmus (Chlorophyta) for over a century-a data base that has
   expanded greatly in the last decade-it has had little impact on
   systmatics within the genus.  The typical organism can produce several
   different ecomorphs, which have often been given varietal status, or
   have even been placed in several species.  The unicellular ecomorph is a
   developmental stage found in the early log phase of growth.  Unicells,
   and even other ecomorphs, are often not reported in certain spiny taxa,
   mainly because investigators carry out only a limited series of
   observations.  Recent studies have shown that unicells do not readily
   form in some taxa, but all spiny species investigated exhibit this
   developmental stage.  In some taxa the inoculum must be carefully
   prepared and cultures should be initiated with a low cell density in
   order to ensure unicell formation.  The unicell is one of the more
   important morphs produced, as it is not only ideal for dispersal but
   also critical in the determination of species limits.  The original
   description of S. armatus included only late log-phase colonies.  Its
   broad series of ecomorphs can be divided into six categories, all of
   which can be observed as developmental stages as a population is
   monitored through its growth curve.  The reason for many of the
   disparate findings in the last two decades now becomes clear. 
   Standardized procedures, at least to ensure a presentation of all
   developmental stages, are urgently needed.}},

Abstract = {{The genetics of tissue culture response in potato has been examined by
   analysing a sample of dihaploids 2n = 2x = 24) extracted from tetraploid
   parents (4n = 4x = 48).  The genotypes were screened for rate of nodal
   multiplication, in vitro tuberisation, regeneration from leaf discs and
   protoplast plating efficiency.  Significant differences were detected
   between dihaploids for the traits measured and this indicates that
   tissue culture response in the tetraploid parents must be in the
   heterozygous condition.  Estimates of the broad sense heritabilities
   were calculated together with the number of genes or effective factors
   involved in the control of the traits.  These estimates indicate that
   tissue culture response in potatio is under relatively simple genetic
   control and ``blocks of genes{''} may be located on specific
   chromosomes.  The inheritance of RFLP markers in the segregating
   dihaploid population was also monitored and the potential of using
   molecular markers linked to gene(s) controlling tissue culture response
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In order to quantify bioturbation processes in a coastal Mediterranean
   ecosystem, experiments were performed to determine sediment mixing rates
   resulting from macrobenthos activity.  Particle flux was measured in
   situ for 22 days using luminophores, which are colored sediment
   particles with sizes ranging from 10 to 200-mu-m.
   In sediment depths from 0-5 cm, particle mixing was intensive due to
   high macrobenthos abundance.  A small quantity of luminophores was
   transported down to a depth of 14 +/- 2 cm, where the macrofauna was
   represented principally by Polychetes.  In a control experimental
   structure - without benthic fauna - no transfer of luminophores into the
   sediment was recorded.
   Sediment particle mixing measured in the ecosystem studied is intensive,
   and is the result of high macrobenthos activity.  Different mixing modes
   occur with scales and rates depending on the organisms present.  The
   luminophore profile resulting from bioturbation processes is explained
   by an intensive bioadvection sediment mixing added to a biodiffusive
   mixing with an order of magnitude of 10(-6) cm2 s-1.  Tracer
   accumulations between 1 and 2 +/- 1 cm and between 4 and 5 +/- 1 cm are
   attributed to bioadvection activity of two or more distinct populations.
   Studies over a larger time scale have been undertaken to monitor
   developments in the observed subsurface maxima.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of daily fecal pellet production and intertidal bioerosion by the
   chiton, Acanthopleura granulata Gmelin, 1791 were measured along the
   shore of Pigeon Creek, an interior marine tidal creek on San Salvador
   Island.  Chitons grazed upon pitted, biokarstic Pleistocene limestones
   which form outcrops within the intertidal zone.  The low-energy,
   tide-dominated character of the waterway fosters excellent preservation
   of delicate chiton fecal pellets, and allowed a more accurate, in situ
   measurement of bioerosion by directly counting their daily accumulation.
   Chitons were abundant (5.5 chitons.m-2), with adults and juveniles
   present in a 2.8:1 ratio along the exposed rocky shoreline.  An average
   daily production rate of 67.2 pellets.chiton-1 was calculated from 43
   individuals monitored for 4 days.  Pellet counts were highly variable
   among days and among individuals.  Organically bound, 3-4 mm long fecal
   pellets were 94.3\% CaCO3 by weight, and composed of a variety of
   constituent grain types and textures.  Individual pellets from adults
   and juveniles contained about 2.1 and 0.7 mg CaCO3, respectively. 
   Assuming that the mass of carbonate deposited as fecal pellets is equal
   to that eroded from the coast, an annual carbonate erosion rate of 41.5
   g.yr-1.chiton-1 results.  Combined with the 1.82 g.cm-3 average density
   of the pelletal grainstone/packstone which they graze, a volumetric
   erosion rate of 22.8 cm3. yr-1.chiton-1 results.  Using local population
   density, an overall bioplanation rate of 0.12 mm.yr-1 exists across the
   rocky intertidal zone due to the activities of A. granulata alone. 
   Intertidal exposure hardens otherwise easily disaggregated chiton
   pellets, and may enhance their geologic preservation potential.  If
   recognized in the fossil record, preserved chiton pellets may indicate
   proximity to low-energy, tide-dominated rocky shores, along which this
   process is most common.}},

   maintenance on the catch of western spruce budworm moths, Choristoneura

   reduced the trapping efficiency of both the sticky traps and the
   non-sticky Uni-traps relative to traps from which the moths were removed
   every 2 days. Correlations between the total season's catch and larval
   density per plot in the same and following generations were not
   significant (P > 0.05) for any of the eight combinations of trap design,
   lure concentration, and maintenance regimen tested. However, by dividing
   the mean moth catch in Uni-traps by either the basal area or foliage
   biomass per hectare in each plot, correlations with the following year's

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted from 1985 to 1988 in commercial corn fields
   distributed throughout the main corn growing areas of Manitoba to
   determine the distribution, phenology, and the level of infestation of
   the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner).  Pheromone and
   blacklight traps were used to monitor the flight activity of European
   corn borer throughout the flight period.  The level of European corn
   borer infestation was determined by sampling for egg masses, hatched egg
   masses, plants with egg masses, plants with shot holes, larvae, and
   stalk breakage.  Results indicated that the European corn borer
   infestation occurred throughout the corn growing areas of Manitoba and
   that the population has declined from 1985 through 1988.  Significant
   positive correlations existed among the number of egg masses, plants
   with egg masses, plants with shot holes, larvae per plant, and plants
   with broken stalks.  Peak capture of moths in pheromone traps occurred
   well after peak oviposition, and 10-14 days after the peak blacklight
   trap capture.  Blacklight trap catch, but not the pheromone trap catch,
   was positively correlated with egg mass density.  Both blacklight and
   pheromone traps were equally efficient in determining the onset and the
   duration of European corn borer flight, although for initiating surveys
   of egg masses and shot hole damage, pheromone traps are recommended.  In
   Manitoba, corn growers apply pesticides well before the recommended
   damage threshold is reached.}},

Abstract = {{We sketch an iterative assessment process for the effects of climate
   change on freshwater fisheries that uses water temperature, water
   quantity, and water quality variables to link the atmosphere to fishery
   resources.  Iterative interaction among atmospheric, ecological, and
   fisheries scientists clarifies the information needs of each discipline
   and progressively improves the assessments of effects.  The process
   incorporates information at different scales, i.e., organism/laboratory,
   species/habitat, and population/ecosystem.  We illustrate the operation
   of the iterative assessment process with recent work done on the water
   temperature linkage, and sketch some linkages through water quantity and
   water quality variables.  A Wild Salmonid Watch (WSW) could provide a
   framework for monitoring climate change and its effect on salmonid
   stocks on a hemispheric scale.  We discuss the initial steps required to
   mobilize a WSW for climate change and its role as climate change
   develops in the decades ahead.}},

Abstract = {{During the past two decades scientific research has demonstrated the
   wideranging environmental effects of large dams.  In developing
   countries, continued population growth and increased per capita
   resources demand are inevitable.  In many countries, large dams will
   continue to be the focus of development to achieve food and energy
   security.  Throughout Latin America large dams and reservoirs have
   become widespread since 1970 and continue to be built at a rate of two
   every three years.  The main driving force is hydro-electric power
   production.  South America has 20\% of the world's hydro-electric power
   potential but in 1988 only 10\% of this potential was exploited.  The
   main focus of development is the upper Parana in south-east Brazil,
   although most large rivers are being developed to varying degrees.
   Large alluvial rivers are dominated by lateral gradients that greatly
   modify the longitudinal pattern of ecosystem processes predicted by the
   River Continuum Concept.  Indeed, the main channel itself is primarily a
   zone of downstream transport, migration and refuge.  Maximum ecological
   diversity and productivity occurs in reaches having maximum aquatic edge
   or ecotone.  The floodplain ecotone is characterized by a mosaic of
   patches determined by hydrological and geomorphological processes.  Many
   species are adapted to the hydrological regime, and the associated
   biogeochemical dynamics, which are particularly pronounced in tropical
   rivers.  Along South American rivers the ecotone is particularly
   important for fisheries.  However, the hydrological and geomorphological
   processes' are influenced by the human activities in the upstream
   catchment, including reservoir developments.  The ecotone is
   particularly sensitive to river regulation, and in many cases impacts
   are exaccerbated by deforestation and pollution associated with urban
   development, industrialization and mining.  Pollution can be
   particularly problematic in impounded and regulated reaches.
   All dams change riverine ecosystems downstream.  Impacts on fisheries
   will result from creating barriers to migrations; from hydrological
   changes and water-quality changes; from changes of channel morphology,
   aquatic plants and invertebrate communities; and from reduced linkages
   between main river and floodplain.  The fisheries of the once forested
   alluvial floodplain rivers of the temperate zone were drastically
   altered as a result of river regulation, and historical studies from
   Europe, for example, illustrate the vulnerability of floodplain rivers
   to hydrological changes.  However, in Europe one focus of current
   scientific endeavour is to restore the forested, seasonally-inundated
   floodplain environments along some large rivers, including the Rhine and
   Danube.  This has stimulated concern in developing countries for
   improved management strategies for rivers to ensure the sustainability
   of environmental resources.
   Environmentally-sound regulation of large rivers in South America
   requires maintenance of the ecotones.  Developments are required in two
   areas:  catchment planning and secondary regulation.  Catchment
   management involves two components.  First, the focussing of development
   on a few rivers so that others can be conserved in a wild state is a
   philosophy that is rapidly gaining support, not least by sponsoring
   agencies such as the World Bank.  Secondly, as there is a more or less
   definable limit to the downstream effect of dams, consideration of the
   location and operational policy of proposed dams in a basin-wide context
   offers opportunities to minimize impacts and to protect vulnerable
   areas.  Protection must be given, in particular, to locations of centers
   of organization.
   Once a plan has been proposed, secondary regulation measures must be
   developed to mitigate the anticipated adverse impacts.  At a large
   scale, these should include measures to sustain the hydrological and
   geomorphological dynamics.  At a smaller scale, management actions will
   be needed to maintain patches within the ecotone.  These objectives will
   be met by a combination of three groups of tools.  First, flow
   management requires the allocation of water to conserve ecosystem
   dynamics.  Secondly, channel management involves engineering works to
   maintain the geomorphological structure of the system.  Thirdly,
   controls on biota and human activities may be introduced, including
   stocking and culling, access and fishing restrictions.
   It would be naive to believe that secondary regulation measures alone
   can protect all ecosystems and all species.  However, given appropriate
   administration and coordination during both the planning and project
   monitoring phases, the combination of catchment management and secondary
   regulation could facilitate environmentally-sound river development.}},

Abstract = {{Attractive compounds affecting the mass aggregation of bark beetle
   populations on host trees suitable for colonization usually consist of
   two obligatory components that act synergistically and
   species-specifically. Semiochemicals inhibiting response act on their
   own and seem less specific.  From nearly 100 species investigated so
   far, mass aggregation can be simulated with commercial synthetics in
   about nine species of economic importance.  Aspects leading to the
   application of attractants in monitoring and mass trapping pest
   populations affecting European spruce forests result from intensive
   coordinated research at the university, industry, and forestry level.
   Technology transfer was facilitated by, and adapted to, the
   infrastructure of European forestry; traps economically replace the trap
   tree methods conventionally used for centuries.  Expected applications
   in the near future are refined monitoring methods to measure population
   levels and predict damages.  Also, mass trapping should remain a
   worthwhile tool in preventing beetle damage in forests under management
   intensive enough to remove excessive breeding material.  In the long
   run, response-inhibiting semiochemicals resulting in the dispersal of
   pest populations (Ablenkstoffe) may gain wider application.  The spruce
   engraver Ips typographus L. and its associate Pityogenes chalcographus
   L. are used as examples to describe the feasibility of developing and
   applying inhibitors as new tools in the management of bark beetle pests:
   Applying a slow-release verbenone formulation (verbenone strip) wrapped
   around the trunk of spruce trees at breast height appears to protect
   spruces from destructive attack by Ips typographus, while small
   polyethylene ampullae containing terpinene-4-ol counteract aggregation
   of P. chalcographus.  Inhibitors appear applicable in both strategies,
   damage prevention as well as damage restriction, and consequently may
   accommodate also pest control in less intensively managed forests.
   Future application of semiochemicals in the management of bark beetle
   pests will rest with the availability of effective means an methods and
   their acceptance by the forestry interest.  This acceptance is presently
   somewhat hampered by misconceptions about mass trapping, and by (1)
   ``missing links{''} in the knowledge of the beetles' dispersal and
   aggregation behavior, (2) the chemosynthesis of chiral pheromone
   components at the industrial level, and (3) legal barriers.}},

Abstract = {{Allelochemicals are known to serve important roles at all steps in the
   host-searching sequence of parasitoids. We discuss the various roles of
   these allelochemics and the type of information needed to develop their
   use in pest control, which to date has been very limited. Rapid
   advancements are being made with respect to airborne chemicals and
   longer-range foraging behavior. Moreover, recent discoveries have shown
   that genetic diversity in parasitoid populations and phenotypic
   plasticity of individuals, together with their physiological state,
   often result in substantial variations in the response to chemical cues.
   Successful application of semiochemical-parasitoid systems will require
   management of these intrinsic parasitoid variables as well as management
   of the foraging environment. We illustrate emerging technology for such
   an application. For the immediate future, the development of this
   technology will allow us to: (1) define the genetic and phenotypic
   foraging profiles important to consistent and efficient parasitoid
   foraging and (2) establish the proper propagation and release procedures
   and monitoring bioassays necessary to ensure appropriate behavioral and
   physiological qualities of released organisms. For the long term, we
   envision technology for comprehensively manipulating the pest/crop
   environment in ways that would provide foraging stimuli and other needs
   important to retention and efficiency of parasitoids.}},

Abstract = {{The numbers of all species of seabirds regularly occurring in the North
   Sea are presented and a brief account is given of the main processes
   affecting their population dynamics.  Monitoring of breeding numbers and
   known trends, distribution at sea, and the patterns of movement of both
   breeding and non-breeding birds are described.
   Feeding methods and foraging behaviour are discussed and methods for
   determining the diet of seabirds are critically examined.  Quantitative
   methods for determining the amount of food taken, and the ecological
   energetics of seabirds are dealt with in some detail, including the
   problem of the availability of food to birds.  Physical factors such as
   tide, weather and sea-state affect several aspects of seabird biology.
   The relationship between seabird population and fish stocks and
   fisheries is of increasing importance and the major aspects of these are
   described and discussed in detail.  Other impacts of man such as
   pollution by oil, chemicals and rubbish are also important.  Predation
   by introduced mammals and also by the native larger gulls, and
   unintentional disturbance resulting from human recreation, can have
   serious effects on breeding colonies.  In the south-eastern North Sea
   low-lying coasts are vulnerable to flooding and affected by land
   reclamation and coastal management.}},

Abstract = {{Zamia pumila L. (Cycadales) is a long-lived dioecious plant with a
   herb-like habit common in the fire-climax pine forests of southeast
   Florida. To evaluate sex-related differences in its reproductive
   strategy, frequency and size of reproductive effort were monitored for
   males and females in a population over an 8-year period after fire.
   Eighty-seven percent of the non-seedling plants in the population coned
   during the study period, revealing a sex ratio of 1.8 male/female.
   Coning sex ratios for each season varied from 2.7-12 male/female. On
   average males coned once every 1.6 years and produced a mean of 1.45
   cones/yr while females coned once every 3.7 yr with a mean of 0.35
   cones/yr. Energy investment in reproduction over the entire study
   period, however, was on average 3.4 times greater for females. Leaf and
   cone production declined by the 8th and 9th year after fire, as shrubs
   recovering from fire damage shaded the habitat. Reproduction in Z.
   pumila is compared with that in other iteroparous dioecious plants and
   animals in which there is divergent selection between the sexes for
   reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{The direction of recent research into the use of pheromones and food
   attractants for detection, monitoring and control of stored-product
   insects is considered.  The value of the moth pheromones has been
   clearly demonstrated both within premises and outdoors.  Further work on
   the composition of pheromones produced by moths and on trap design may
   be desirable.  Recent progress with the beetle sex pheromones includes
   the design of a new Khapra beetle trap and further studies on the
   stereochemical complexity and inhibitory isomers of anobiid pheromones. 
   Promising advances are also being reported with the beetle aggregation
   pheromones with new trap designs, newly identified components and
   synthetic material free from inhibitory isomers.  Further study is
   needed to elucidate how species specificity is maintained between
   species whose pheromones are closely related chemically, and to
   investigate the synergistic interaction with food attractants.  The
   potential of food attractants alone as non-specific lures is exemplified
   by work with extracts of crushed carob pods.  There is a growing number
   of examples of the successful use of these attractants but many aspects
   of their effects on insects are not yet fully understood.  Full
   exploitation of the potential of attractants for stored-product insects
   still needs further research in virtually every area of the subject from
   initial characterisation to the development of a suitably simple
   combination of trap and lure for practical use.}},

Abstract = {{Sticky traps are highly useful for the detection of low-level insect
   populations which are otherwise difficult to detect in processed
   commodity storages.  Even where insect populations may be moderately
   high, as in the storage of unprocessed agricultural commodities, they
   are useful for making management decisions on insecticidal treatments
   and safe storage periods.  These traps enable warehousemen to locate
   infestations and take corrective action while the infestations are still
   small and before they spread to other commodities.  Recently, these
   traps have been used to demonstrate monitoring of feral populations of
   stored-product insects in some climatic areas of the world.  Feral
   populations likely serve as reservoirs of insects for infestation of
   stored commodities, a possibility of much significance for storage
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Pheromone traps for stored-product insects have been generally used by
   industry for 10 years, particularly by food stores, food processors,
   pest control companies, seed companies, and the grain industry.  The
   cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius)) pheromone was the
   most frequently purchased (48.8\%) in 1987 and 1988 from Insects
   Limited, Inc., followed by the Indianmeal moth (Plodia interpuntella
   (Hubner)) (20.3\%), Trogoderma complex (Trogoderma spp.) (14.3\%), and
   red and confused flour beetles (Tribolium spp.) (5.3\%).  A long-term
   study on cigarette beetles in an Hawaiian food storage facility and a
   laboratory experiment indicated that continuous and extensive use of
   cigarette beetle-pheromone-baited traps may be effective for both
   monitoring and long-term suppression of cigarette beetle populations. 
   Pheromone trapping is especially useful in warehouses containing tobacco
   treated with methoprene and in tobacco factories to detect insects. 
   Cigarette beetle pheromone traps did not reduce populations of cigarette
   beetles in a laboratory experiment.  The Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA) has recently clarified its position on the use of insect traps in
   storage facilities.  Insects found in traps will not be used toward the
   tolerance for insects in the facility.  Recognition by the Federal
   Government of the benefits of insect traps for monitoring populations
   will spur the development of Intergrated Pest Management (IPM) programs.
   Action levels can be decided and the judicious use of control methods
   can be prescribed when population growth is observed in one or more
   areas of a facility.  The data collected from each trap can be very
   important for planning a control strategy.  The practical application of
   pheromones to disrupt insect behavior, e.g., preventing reproduction of
   a pest provides another option in a total pest management strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Van Campens Brook is a circumneutral stream in northwestern New Jersey
   that supports reproducing populations of brook trout (Salvelinus

   snowmelt in the spring of 1984.  A stream pH of 4.5 was recorded shortly
   after the onset of the snowmelt and the pH remained depressed (5.2) a
   week later.  Stream pH did not fall below 6.2 following other rain and
   snowmelt events monitored during 1985-1987.  An electrofishing survey
   conducted in 1985 revealed a near-total absence of 1984 year-class
   rainbow trout, spring spawners that are highly sensitive to acidity. 
   Brook and brown trout spawning appeared to be unaffected.  Rainbow trout
   reproductive success was good during 1985-87.}},

Abstract = {{Meristematic activity in shoot apices of NCTG-22, a short-day (SD)
   sensitive cultivar of Nicotiana tabacum, was monitored throughout the
   17-d period of transition from vegetative to reproductive growth.  The
   analysis included changes in (1) size of the apical meristem, (2) rate
   of leaf initiation, (3) amount of nuclear DNA, and (4) percentage of
   cells in division.  Plants grown in controlled environment chambers set
   at 26/22 C day/night temperatures were exposed either to an inductive
   short-day photoperiod or a noninductive long-day (LD) photoperiod after
   a 6-wk juvenile period.  The first morphological change associated with
   floral onset was an acceleration in the rate of leaf initiation
   following three inductive cycles, which continued and resulted in the
   eventual production of three more leaves by SD plants than by vegetative
   LD plants.  Apices were identical in size until seven inductive cycles
   were completed, after which SD apices began to enlarge, finally becoming
   more than twice as wide as LD apices and assuming a domed shape.  At the
   cellular level the percentage of cells in division increased in SD
   apices after one inductive cycle and generally remained significantly
   higher (1\%-2.5\%) than in LD apices during the entire transition
   period.  A majority of the population of cells in LD apices favored the
   G1 condition.  After exposure to one and three SD cycles, however,
   12\%-14\% more cells were in the G1 phase in SD apices than in LD. 
   During SDs 8-15, concurrent with dome enlargement, 10\%-26\% more cells
   again were in G1 than in apices.  These results and previous
   observations on the floral transition in Nicotiana suggest that there
   may be two different processes controlling meristematic activity during
   two different phases of the transition period.}},

Abstract = {{Population dynamics of unexploited stocks of the West Indian topshell,
   Cittarium pica, were studied from October, 1983, to December, 1985, in
   the Exuma Cays, Bahamas.  Snails were tagged at two sites of high
   population density to examine temporal aspects of natural mortality,
   growth, and recruitment, while reproduction and activity pattern were
   monitored at separate sites.  At the site of highest density (8.42 +/-
   0.97 snails.m-2, 95\% confidence interval), mortality was highest for
   small snails and showed significant temporal variation (total releases =
   561).  At the site of lowest density (4.35 +/- 0.47 snails.m-2) no size
   or temporal effects on mortality were demonstrated (total releases =
   386).  For both sites combined, the median annual instantaneous rate of
   natural mortality (M) for small snails (10-50 mm shell width) was 1.05
   (95\% confidence limits = 0.43-2.07), while for large snails (> 50 mm)
   it was 0.59 (0.00-1.23).  At the site of highest population density,
   growth rates appeared to vary seasonally with lowest rates occurring
   during winter.  At this site L- infinity was estimated at 91.15 cm and K
   at 0.3028.  Growth rates were highest at the site of lowest population
   density where a decrease in growth rate coincided with a bloom of
   filamentous benthic intertidal algae.  The annual average von
   Bertalanffy growth parameters L-infinity and K at the Patter site were
   96.60 cm and 0.3648, respectively.  Gonadal development peaked during
   summer.  For three consecutive years, annual peaks in recruitment
   occurred during summer at both sites, demonstrating that the population
   size-frequency modes identified represent year classes.  The species
   tends to be nocturnal and moves only small distances.  After 255 days
   the median displacement along the shore by snails at a sheltered site
   was 7.5 m and the largest displacement was 33.5 m (N = 33).  The snails
   showed size-specific zonation with small individuals higher on the shore
   than large ones.  While snails 10-70 mm in shell width migrated strongly
   with the semi-diurnal tides, animals either smaller or larger than this
   size range did not.}},
