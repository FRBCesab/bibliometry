Abstract = {{Lead poisoning prevention requires knowledge of lead sources and of
   appropriate residential lead standards. Data are severely lacking on
   lead sources for Native American children, many of whom live in rural
   areas. Further, the relation of mining waste to blood lead
   concentrations (BPbs) of rural children is controversial. In
   collaboration with the eight tribes of northeastern Oklahoma, we
   assessed lead sources and their effects on BPbs for rural Native
   American and White children living in a former mining region. Venous
   blood lead, residential environmental (soil, dust, paint, water), and
   caregiver interview (e.g., hand-to-mouth behaviors, socioeconomic
   conditions) data were obtained from a representative sample of 245
   children 1-6 years of age. BPbs ranged from 1 to 24 mug/dL. There were
   no ethnic differences in BPbs (p = 0.48) nor any patterns of excess lead
   sources for Native American or White children. Multiple linear
   regression analyses indicated that mean soil lead, mean floor lead
   loading, mouthing behaviors, caregivers' education, and residence in
   former mining towns were all strongly associated with BPbs. Logistic
   regression results showed mean floor dust lead loading >10.1 pg/ft(2)
   (odds ratio {[}OR], 11.4; 95\% confidence interval {[}0], 3.5-37.3), and
   yard soil lead >165.3 mg/kg (OR, 4.1; CI, 1.3-12.4) were independently
   associated with BPbs greater than or equal to10 mug/dL. We also found
   strong interactions between soil lead and poverty (p = 0.005), and dust
   and soil sources (p = 0.02). Our findings indicate that soil and dust
   lead derived largely from mining waste pose a health hazard to Native
   American and White children, and that current residential dust lead
   standards are insufficient to adequately protect children. Moreover, our
   finding that poor children are especially vulnerable to lead exposures
   suggests that residential standards should consider interactions among
   socioeconomic conditions and lead sources if environmental justice is to
   be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Ten-day acute mortality of the benthic amphipod Ampelisca abdita is used
   in a number of regulatory, research, and monitoring programs to evaluate
   chemical contamination of marine sediments. Although this endpoint has
   proven to be valuable for characterizing the relative toxicities of
   sediments, the significance of acute mortality with respect to
   population viability has not yet been established. In this study,
   population modeling along with empirical extrapolation were used to
   describe a relationship between acute mortality and population-level
   response of A. abdita. The research involved the performance of a
   standard 10-d sediment toxicity bioassay and a 70-d full life-cycle
   chronic population (including reproduction) bioassay exposing A. abdita
   to sediments spiked with concentrations of the divalent metal cadmium
   (normalized to acid volatile sulfide) expected to produce a range of
   biological effects. These data provided age-specific schedules of
   survival and fecundity that were used to parameterize an age-classified
   projection matrix model for A. abdita. Measured exposure data and
   population growth rate estimates, obtained using the demographic
   information collected during the 70-d assay, were used to develop
   exposure-response models. These data were also used to develop an
   empirical relationship between population growth rate (X) and acute
   mortality. This relationship describes how acute data may be used to
   predict concentrations that produce population-level effects. Model
   manipulations permit extrapolation of early life-stage mortality (the
   acute endpoint) to changes in population growth rate. These
   relationships were used to evaluate a range of ecologically acceptable
   acute mortality for A. abdita.}},

Abstract = {{The downstream movements of wild Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., from
   their established feeding territories in the River Itchen, Hampshire,
   UK, were logged continuously over an 11-month period using a passive
   integrated transponder (PIT) antenna system. The time of these movements
   was then related to a number of monitored and calculated environmental
   parameters. Initial downstream movement of smolts in April was
   correlated with the onset of darkness, at which time salmon moved from
   their established feeding territories alone. No relationship was found
   between the number of smolts migrating and river flow or maximum daily
   water temperature. The timing of downstream movement of parr between
   October and March was random with regard to sunset and time of maximum
   daily water temperature, suggesting the environmental cue that initiates
   movement may be different outside the spring smolt period.}},

Abstract = {{Long primer PCR (LP-PCR) markers specifically targeted to sequences
   involved in the response to abiotic stress were utilised to analyse
   genetic variation within and among wild barley populations from Israel.
   Populations were sampled in locations reflecting a wide range of
   habitats and the potential correlation between genetic variation and
   ecogeographic parameters was examined. A high level of polymorphism was
   observed. Most of the variability was due to differences within
   populations, however a substantial portion of genetic variation (36\%)
   could be attributed to differences among populations, indicating local
   adaptation of genotypes to microclimatic conditions. Moreover,
   clustering and ordination techniques showed that genotypes grouped
   together according to their area of origin and were separated on the
   basis of ecogeography, chiefly by a combination of temperature, altitude
   and rainfall variables. Finally, 28\% of the polymorphic PCR fragments
   were significantly correlated with ecogeographic parameters. Our results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of PCR-based molecular markers targeted to
   environmentally regulated genes in detecting `useful' variation and thus
   in monitoring the impact exerted by adaptation to the environment on
   genetic differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The Eared Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis Brehm) is the North American bird
   species most closely associated with highly saline habitats, and in
   winter and early spring it is the most abundant waterbird at the Salton
   Sea. During the fall, the great majority of the North American
   population stages at hypersaline lakes in the Great Basin, departing in
   early winter for wintering areas in southern California and Mexico,
   principally in the central Gulf of California. On the northward return
   flight, nearly all the population passes through the Salton Sea, where
   concentrations of >1 million have been reported in February-March. After
   staging for several weeks, grebes leave in March-April and migrate
   toward breeding grounds in the northern United States and southern
   Canada. The Sea's development as the species' major spring staging area
   may be as recent as the 1960s, and presumably awaited the establishment
   of appropriate prey populations of marine worms. In the past decades,
   two major dieoffs at the Sea each resulted in the undiagnosed death of
   tens of thousands of birds. Whether the cause(s) are endemic to the Sea
   or involve the grebes' migration routes and stopover locations is
   unknown. Because of problems in estimating numbers, the significance of
   these mortality events is hard to evaluate. Population trends are better
   studied at fall staging areas, especially Mono Lake, where population
   turnover is inconsequential, grebes are virtually the only species
   present, and numbers can be ascertained by aerial photography.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting success and chick survival of a migratory population of Houbara
   Bustard Chlamydotis{[}undulata] macqueenii were studied during three
   consecutive years (1998-2000) in the Xinjiang province of north-west
   China. A total of 45 nests was monitored and 85 broods comprising 227
   chicks were captured, of which 82 chicks were radio-tracked. Start of
   laying varied between 6 and 17 April between years but the laying mode
   fell consistently between 26 and 30 April. Mean clutch size was 4.0 (sd
   = 0.8) (range 2-6) for early clutches and 3.3 (sd = 1.1) for late
   clutches (range 2-5). The average nesting success was 0.588 (sd = 0.270)
   but great variations were observed between years -0.882 in 1998, 0.530
   in 1999 and 0.351 in 2000. This was related to increased predation in
   1999 and 2000, which is reflected by increased predator density (chiefly
   Corsac Fox Vulpes corsac and Long-legged Buzzards Buteo rufinus). The
   overall hatchability, defined as the proportion of eggs hatched in
   successful nests was 0.839 sd = 0.238). The average brood size at
   hatching varied from 2.9 (sd = 0.8) to 3.3 (sd = 0.9) according to
   years, and no significant decrease in brood size was observed in the
   first 5 days post-hatching. In 1999 and 2000 the brood size diminished
   sharply (14\% and 27\%, respectively) in prefledging chicks. A further
   severe decrease (37\%) was observed in fledglings in 2000, probably due
   to predation by raptors. For the 3 years of the study, a successful
   female Houbara would bring on average 2.3 (sd = 0.9) chicks to fledging
   and would have lost 30.2\% (sd = 14.9\%) of its brood to adversity
   during the rearing process. The proportion of females that lost their
   entire brood was 0.181 in 1998, 0,708 in 1999 and 0,453 in 2000. For the
   3 years of the study, only 55.3\% (sd = 26.3\%) of the females hatching
   eggs brought chicks to fledging. The overall chick production was 0.827
   per breeding female per year and the probability of an egg laid
   producing a fledgling of 8 weeks old was 0.190.}},

Abstract = {{To help banana growers to decide when to apply nematicide, economic
   thresholds were determined for tropical north Queensland, subtropical
   south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales, Australia. This was
   done by monitoring nematode populations, root damage and growth
   parameters of bunching pseudostems in several commercial crops for
   several years. There was no significant consistent change in the disease
   index in consecutive years in any of the regions, although there was
   great variation between crops. However, on two crops in the tropics, the
   disease index of roots increased. To reduce the risk of not applying
   nematicide when required, the economic threshold was adjusted down to
   allow for this increase on some crops. In the tropics with a crop value
   of \$25 000 ha(-1) year(-1), the economic threshold occurred at a root
   disease index = 9.2-15.6. In the subtropics with a crop value of \$10
   000-15 000, the economic threshold occurred at a root disease index =
   20.5-35.5. In the subtropics, Radopholus similis (burrowing nematode)
   was as pathogenic as Pratylenchus goodeyi (lesion nematode) as measured
   by root necrosis. However, both nematodes were less pathogenic in the
   subtropics than was R. similis in the tropics. In the subtropics, R.
   similis tended to be more numerous in warmer months and P. goodeyi in
   cooler months.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that common carp can be used for the control of apple
   snails in rice fields was tested experimentally. In a rice field, 12
   plots of 465 m were set and enclosed by plastic walls to prevent snail
   emigration and immigration. The experiment continued from June to
   September. Three replicated treatments were used for the plots: zero,
   four and 12 carp were released, giving carp densities of 0.0, 0.2 and
   0.6 m(-2), respectively. Snail densities were estimated by the Jolly -
   Seber mark - recapture method. Newly laid egg masses were counted and
   measured for size, and hatching was monitored. The numbers of eggs per
   egg mass (y) were estimated using a regression equation obtained from
   the product of the maximum length and width of the egg mass (x): y=
   0.10x(1.24). Using these measures and the monthly mean hatching rate
   obtained from eggs laid in two outdoor aquaria from April to September,
   the number of hatched eggs was used to estimate the birth rate over a
   given time. A logistic model incorporating these estimates revealed that
   the snail population proliferated only in the zero-carp plot throughout
   the experiment. The study, together with other reports on snail
   longevity, predicts that a snail population would be eliminated in 2
   years at a stocking density of 2000 carp hectare(-1), if no immigration
   of the snail occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Development of late blight of potatoes caused by Phytophthora infestans
   (US 8 fungal genotype, A2 mating type) was monitored in two Russet
   Norkotah commercial fields at Fort Fairfield in 1996 and Duncan Farm in
   1997. Experimental plots representing various disease treatments (low,
   moderate, high and random late blight severity levels) were established
   in two fields in 1996. In 1997, only low and high disease treatments
   were established. The application of fungicides for late blight control
   was conducted in both years. Late blight incidence and severity were
   assessed in each plot of each treatment. Components of late blight
   disease development, tuber blight incidence and tuber yields were
   determined from each plot. Progress of late blight disease was rapid in
   1996 but not in 1997. During the 1996 cropping season, mean disease
   incidence and severity in the random disease treatment plots were 84 and
   21\% respectively within 10 days of disease detection. In 1997, low
   levels of late blight severity were detected in the field plots. Average
   numbers of late blight leaf and stem lesions on infected plant and
   fungal sporangia on the diseased leaf were not significantly affected by
   disease treatment. Late blight foliar severity significantly affected
   potato tuber yields. Lowest tuber yield was obtained in plots with high
   disease levels and highest yields were recorded in plots with low late
   blight severity in 1996. Late blight severity was significantly
   correlated with tuber yield but not with per cent tuber blight.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting lynx predation on sheep in the French Jura}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{204-216}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. In regions where sheep are kept in fenced pastures and do not graze
   unattended in carnivore habitats, sheep losses vary greatly between
   sites and livestock farms. To assess the factors that may predispose
   farms to lynx predation in the French Jura, we compared sheep
   availability and environmental characteristics between pastures with and
   without attacks in a 1800-km(2) study area. Nine lynx were radio-tracked
   in the same area for a total of 21 lynx years to estimate individual
   killing rates on sheep and to identify possible habitual livestock
   killers.
   2. Depending on individual and year, lynx predation rate on sheep within
   lynx home ranges varied between 0 and 12.4 attacks 100 days(-1).
   Predation rate on sheep was not related to sheep abundance nor sheep
   dispersion in lynx home ranges. Two individuals became habitual sheep
   killers during, respectively, their third and fourth year of monitoring.
   Other lynx that had access to the same flocks were only occasional sheep
   killers. No obvious causal factor (e.g. sex, reproductive status,
   physical debilitation) explained the differential individual propensity
   for lynx to kill livestock.
   3. We found no difference in sheep availability between pastures with
   and without attacks, but strong differences in their environmental
   characteristics. In only 5.1\% of 98 pastures > 250 m from a forest were
   sheep attacked by lynx. In 228 pastures adjacent or connected to forests
   by cover, 39.1\% sustained attacks on sheep by lynx (P < 0.01). For
   these latter pastures, logistic regression showed a positive effect of
   their proximity to major forested areas (P < 0.01), absence of human
   dwellings (P < 0.01), local abundance of roe deer (P = 0.01) and the
   presence of attacked pastures in their vicinity (P = 0.03).
   4. These results suggests that lynx damage locally can be explained by a
   predictable set of habitat features that expose sheep on some pastures
   to risk, and by an unpredictable event, i.e. an individual developing
   regular predation on sheep.
   5. In grazing systems like the Jura, where unattended sheep are
   distributed patchily and individual problem lynx may appear, removing
   lynx or lowering density without differentiating individuals will be
   insufficient to limit conflicts. Selective removals could temporarily
   reduce predation but the site effect implies that durable management can
   arise only through improved shepherding. This might include guard dogs
   in the few local sites at risk and providing shelter for sheep at night
   when attacks are on the increase.}},

   methoxyfenozide as first and third instars, respectively, when compared
   with the laboratory reference strain. Among the U.S. field populations
   evaluated, ones from Belle Glade, FL, and Florence, SC, were generally
   the most susceptible and ones from Maricopa and Parker, AZ, were the
   least susceptible. Selection of the Thailand field strain with
   tebufenozide reduced susceptibility to both compounds, and selection of
   Thailand strains previously pressured with either compound further
   reduced susceptibility to both, suggesting at least some commonality of
   resistance mechanism. Characterization of this resistance will provide
   information that will be helpful for pro-active management of resistance
   for this valuable group of insecticides.}},

Abstract = {{Fourteen populations of the diamondback Moth, Plutellaxylostella (L.),
   were collected from fields of crucifer vegetables in the United States,
   Mexico, and Thailand in 1999 and 2000 for susceptibility tests with
   spinosad. Most populations were susceptible to spinosad and similar. to
   earlier baseline values, but populations from Thailand and Hawaii showed
   high levels of tolerance. A statewide survey in Hawaii in 2000 and 2001
   indicated resistance problems on several islands. One colony collected
   in October 2000 from Pearl City, HI, was subjected to further selection
   pressure, using spinosad in the laboratory, and then was used as the
   resistant strain (Pearl-Sel) for other tests. Spray tests using the
   recommended field rates of spinosad on potted broccoli plants in the
   greenhouse confirmed that field control failures due to resistance were
   possible in the areas of these collections. Analysis of probit lines
   from F, reciprocal crosses between the Pearl-Sel and S strain indicated
   that resistance to spinosad was inherited autosomally and was
   incompletely recessive. A direct test of monogenic inheritance based on
   the F, X Pearl-Sel backcrosses suggested that resistance to spinosad was
   probably controlled by one locus. The synergists S,S,S-tributyl
   phosphorotrithioate and piperonyl butoxide did not enhance the toxicity
   of spinosad to the resistant colony, indicating metabolic Mediated
   detoxification was probably not responsible for the spinosad resistance.
   Two field colonies in Hawaii that were resistant to spinosad were not
   cross-resistant to emamectin benzoate or indoxacarb. Resistance
   developed in Hawaii due to the continuous cultivation of crucifers in
   which as many as 50 applications of spinosad per year may have been made
   to a common population of P. xylostella in sequential plantings,
   although each grower might have used the labeled restrictions for
   resistance management. Resistance management strategies will need to
   address such cropping and pest management practices.}},

Abstract = {{The Dumber of plants that sampling requires in aphid population studies

   propose a visual method for estimating the density of the aphid
   Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) on tomato plants reared in greenhouses.
   After approximately 1 min of visual observation plants can be assigned
   to abundance classes, the boundaries of which are roughly the powers. of
   root10 Precise counts were collected simultaneously on sets ofreference
   plants from the same greenhouse. Projection pursuit nonparametric
   regression was then used to provide unbiased estimates of aphid
   densities from the abundance classes and several easily gathered
   explanatory variables. The robustness of the method was evaluated by
   testing the models on the complementary data sets from plants in which
   the aphid densities were precisely counted. In both single and twin-row
   cultural conditions, for the reference and complementary data sets, the
   order of magnitude of the error was less than one class rank per plant.
   The investigation time was reduced by approximately 10-fold compared
   with, the exact counting method. This easy-to-teach field method could
   be useful in large-scale population surveys and for optimizing

Abstract = {{Field trials were conducted in Western Australia to compare captures of
   the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), in a
   standard male-targeted trap (Lynfield trap baited with Capilure) with a
   synthetic, female-targeted attractant marketed as BioLure. BioLure was
   also compared with other female attractants (orange ammonia, liquid
   protein bait) and tested in plastic McPhail, Tephri, and Lynfield traps.
   The possibility of using one trap to monitor female and male C capitata
   populations was also tested by combining BioLure in a trap with the male
   attractant, Capilure. The results of these experiments show that BioLure
   outperformed the female-targeted system currently used for monitoring
   female C. capitata (liquid protein in McPhail trap). More male C.
   capitata were caught in the standard male-targeted trap, but more
   females were caught in traps baited with BioLure irrespective of trap
   type, climate, host tree, or population level. Combined lure traps
   caught equivalent total numbers of C. capitata to the standard
   male-targeted trap, but fewer females were captured. Tephri traps caught
   more flies than McPhail traps, but McPhail traps caught equivalent
   proportions of females. We compared the performance in commercial
   orchards of the standard male-targeted trap with a female-targeted trap
   (McPhail with BioLure.). We found that the male trap detected C.
   capitata more often, caught more flies, triggered the economic threshold
   more often (66\% of the time) and was more cost effective. The
   male-targeted trap is recommended for use on commercial orchards if cost
   is limiting. However, using both male and female-targeted traps
   increases the chance of detecting flies and triggering the economic
   threshold level. The synthetic female attractant is recommended for
   replacement of protein hydrolysate lures and may be used in either
   Tephri or McPhail traps.}},

   samples by the addition of 60\% sulfuric acid at 10 degreesC,
   liquid/liquid partitioning by using hexane and acetone mixture (9: 1)
   and quantification by using GC-ECD. Residues of endosulfan in blood
   samples were quantified as the sum of alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan,
   endosulfan sulfate and endosulfandiol. The influence of temperature
   during the extraction has been studied. Recovery experiments were
   conducted over the concentration range 1.0-50 ng ml(-1) and the relative
   standard deviation calculated. The method was found to be sufficiently
   sensitive to quantify the residue of total endosulfan up to the 1.0 ng
   ml(-1) level. The recovery was 92\% with a calculated relative standard
   deviation of 1.96\%. Conversion of endosulfan to endosulfandiol is found
   to be less than 0.5\% under the defined conditions. The method was
   applied to the analysis of residue contents of endosulfan and its
   metabolites in blood samples collected from the exposed population. The
   data obtained has been confirmed by GC-MS-EI in selective ion monitoring
   (SIM) mode.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect evidence from observations in the field suggested that a common
   and often abundant cyclopoid copepod, Tropocyclops extensus, despite its
   small size (0.5 mm) and largely algal diet, is an important predator of
   the rotifer Polyarthra remata. Laboratory experiments showed that
   copepodids and adults, but not nauplii, markedly suppressed the
   population growth of this rotifer. The suppression could be attributed
   entirely to predation, rather than to exploitative competition for
   shared food resources or to interference. Mortality rates predicted from
   a separate feeding-rate experiment were sufficient to account for the
   decline in population size observed in the Tropocyclops treatment of
   culture experiments. Also, monitoring the availability of cryptomonad
   food in treatments with and without Tropocyclops throughout these
   experiments showed that cryptomonad densities always remained high and
   were just as high or significantly higher in the copepod treatments.
   Furthermore, direct videographic observations of P. remata from cultures
   with and without Tropocyclops demonstrated no significant differences in
   swimming velocity, tendency to deviate from a straight-line path, or
   frequency and length of spontaneous escape responses. Per capita
   ingestion rates of T. extensus on P. remata variedfrom 2 to 8 day(-1),
   were significantly higher for adult females than adult males or
   copepodids V, and increased significantly with rotifer density. A
   tendency of copepods to hat,e higher ingestion rates on young than adult
   rotifers was not significant. Copepods cultured since birth with
   cryptomonads and P. remata ate significantly fewer rotifers than those
   cultured only with cryptomonads; this may be explained by a more sated
   condition of the former and provided no evidence for the idea that
   previous experience with this rotifer might increase predation
   efficiency. The results show that T. extensus in natural communities has
   the potential to deplete natural populations of susceptible rotifer
   prey. Accordingly, shift the species structure of rotifer assemblages in
   favour of resistant species, and provide selection pressure for
   avoidance responses.}},

Abstract = {{Settlement of concholepas concholepas (Gastropoda: Muricidae) on natural
   and artificial substrata was studied between April 1999 and March 2001
   at two sites in central Chile; the Las Cruces Marine Reserve and El
   Quisco Management and Exploited Area. Four different artificial
   materials were tested in the low intertidal zone during 1999 settlement
   season to determine their properties as settlement and microhabitat
   substrata for competent Concholepas larvae. Globular pads made of
   plastic filaments were identified as the best artificial collectors,
   exhibiting overall higher settlement rates than rock plots and lower
   variability among replicates within a given site. Thus, subsequent
   monitoring of settlement used only these globular pads that were
   replaced twice monthly, The temporal pattern of settlement was
   remarkably similar from year to year, starting at the end of austral
   winter (August-September) and ending in summer (December-January),
   defining a temporally restricted settlement season. Settlement at two
   sites within the Marine Reserve of Las Cruces was significantly higher
   than at sites in El Quisco. However, during the second settlement
   season, an additional site at El Quisco exhibited settlement rates
   comparable to those observed at Las Cruces. The results show that
   Concholepas settlement varies significantly over scales of several
   hundreds of metres as well as tens of kilometres, probably due to
   differences in coastal oceanographic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana seedling dynamics were studied in a
   relict forest inside the crater of a volcano where it is the only canopy
   tree species. The objectives of the study were (1) to determine changes
   in seedling density before and after a mast year, as well as to monitor
   seedling recruitment, mortality and growth rate in relation to the
   micro-environment, and (2) to discuss the impact of masting on seedling
   dynamics of the population. Before masting, seedling density was 8.8
   seedlings m(-2), afterwards seedling density peaked at 51.5 seedlings
   m(-2), then decreased by 50\% in 3 months and by 85\% after 8 months,
   down to levels of before the mast year (9.9 seedlings m(-2)) after 16
   months. Seedlings in the forest floor before the mast-seeding event
   showed a low relative growth rate -0.14 rum mm(-1) mo(-1) against 1.27
   mm mm(-1) mo(-1) for seedlings that emerged immediately after masting.
   Seed germination was high (83\%) and rapid (L-50 = 7 days) following
   masting. Seedling growth was positively correlated with soil water
   content but not with temperatures and relative humidity. Data suggested
   that seed production in mast years is important in maintaining the
   seedling bank, and thus the viability of relict Fagus populations.}},

Abstract = {{Though the presence of a species can be unequivocally confirmed, its
   absence can only be inferred with a degree of probability. I used a
   model to calculate the minimum number of unsuccessful visits to a site
   that are necessary to assume that a species is absent. The model
   requires the probability of detection of the species per visit to be
   known. This probability may vary depending on habitat, year, season, the
   area surveyed, the population size of the species, and the observer. I
   studied 3 European snake species-asp viper (Vipera aspis), smooth snake.
   (Coronella austriaca), and grass snake (Natrix natrix)-over a 5-yr
   (1994-1998) interval, and made 645 visits to 87 sites during their
   activity periods. I used a generalized logistic regression approach with
   random effects for years and sites to (1) estimate the probability of
   detection of these species from sites known to be occupied, (2) test
   factors affecting it, and (3) compute the minimum number of times that a
   site must be visited to infer the absence of the particular species.
   Probability of detection for all species was heavily influenced by an
   index of population size. For V probability of detection increased from
   0.23 to 0.50 and 0.70 in small, medium, and large populations,
   respectively. Similarly, probability of detection increased from 0.09 to
   0.45 and 0.56 in small, medium, and large populations of. austriaca,
   respectively, and from 0.11 in small to 0.25 in medium and large
   populations of X natrix Probability of detection also varied across
   months for all 3 species, among habitat types (C austriaca only), and
   from year to year (X natrix only). Sites with unknown occupancy status
   conservatively may be assumed to be occupied by small populations. I
   calculated that such sites need to be surveyed 12, 34, and 26 times for
   V aspis, C austriaca, and A natrix, respectively, before assuming with
   95\% probability that the site is unoccupied. These results suggest that
   same species may be more widespread than thought. However, to ascertain
   the presence of such species at a site, search efforts need to be
   intensive.}},

Title = {{Metallothionein in liver of eels Anguilla anguilla from the Thames
   Estuary: an indicator of environmental quality?}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the cysteine-rich
   protein metallothionein (MT) in the detoxification and metabolism of
   metals in livers of eels Anguilla anguilla from the Thames Estuary, and
   to assess the value of MT measurements in environmental monitoring.
   Hepatic MT levels and associated metal concentrations were determined in
   A. anguilla collected on three occasions during 1998 at sites along the
   tidal Thames (from freshwater to the sea) and also from a reference site
   (Tamar Estuary) in southwest England. MT was present at basal levels of
   2 mg g(-1) dry weight (dw), predominantly in association with the
   essential metals Cu and Zn. MT concentrations were variable within each
   eel `population' but were generally highest (up to 11 mg g(-1) in
   individual eels) at the more contaminated upperand mid-estuarine sites
   in the Thames (e.g. Brentford and Kew). Lowest MT levels were those in
   eels from Blythe Sands at the mouth of the estuary. Season, sex,
   reproductive status and salinity may have influenced MT levels to some
   extent, although metals were the most significant factor. Hepatic MT
   concentrations were highly correlated with associated metal burdens (Zn,
   Cu, Ag and Cd),-notably reflecting Cu and Ag enrichment in the upper-
   and mid-estuary. With the exception of Zn, metals in the supernatant
   fraction of eel livers were primarily associated with MT. Proportions of
   Cu, Ag and Cd bound to MT increased as a function of accumulated metal
   burdens, with no indication of saturation. Thus, despite causing
   induction of MT, excess bioavailable Cu, Ag and Cd appear to be
   successfully detoxified in eels over the range of environmental
   contamination encountered along the Thames Estuary. Paradoxically, it
   may be argued from conventional doctrine that the presence or raised
   levels of MT, at upstream sites, constitutes a response to contamination
   and, by definition, signals that the fish are affected by metals;
   however, obvious signs of deleterious effects were not detected.
   Superficially, from liver NIT data, it would seem that eel populations
   have become biochemically adapted to metal contamination. The approach
   tested here has proved viable in helping to interpret trends in
   bioavailability and the toxicological significance of accumulated metal
   burdens in Thames eels. A. anguilla is a common inhabitant of estuarine
   and fresh waters throughout Europe. and related species occur world
   wide. Therefore, determination of hepatic NIT (and associated metals) in
   eels could be useful for monitoring responses to metal exposure and
   environmental quality on a much broader basis. Ideally these
   determinations should be performed in tandem with other
   sublethal-effects measurements to maximise information, (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A dialysis cultivation system was used to enrich slow-growing moderately
   thermophilic anaerobic bacteria at high cell densities. Bicarbonate
   buffered mineral salts medium with 5 mM glutamate as the sole carbon and
   energy source was used and the incubation temperature was 55degreesC.
   The reactor inoculum originated from anaerobic methanogenic granular
   sludge bed reactors. The microbial Population was monitored over a
   period of 2 years using the most probable number (MPN) technique. in the
   reactor glutamate was readily degraded to ammonium, methane, and carbon
   dioxide. Cell numbers of glutamate-degrading organisms increased
   400-fold over the first year. In medium supplemented with bromoethane
   sulfonic acid (BES, an inhibitor of methanogenesis), tenfold lower cell
   numbers were counted, indicating the syntrophic nature of glutamate
   degradation. After 2 years of reactor operation the predominant
   organisms were isolated and characterized. Methanobacterium
   thermoautotrophicum (strain R43) and a Methanosaeta thermophila strain
   (strain A) were the predominant hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic
   methanogens, respectively. The numbers in which the organisms were
   present in the reactor after 24 months of incubation were 8.6 x 10(9)
   and 3.8 x 10(7) mL(-1) sludge, respectively. The most predominant
   glutamate-degrading organism (8.6 x 10(7) mL(-1) sludge), strain Z, was
   identified as a new species, Caloramator coolhaasii. it converted
   glutamate to hydrogen, acetate, some propionate, ammonium, and carbon
   dioxide. Growth of this syntrophic organism on glutamate was strongly
   enhanced by the presence of methanogens.}},

Abstract = {{Running buffalo clover (Trifolium stoloniferum Muhl, ex. A. Eaton), a
   federally endangered plant species. often occurs in habitats affected by
   periodic disturbance such as mowing or grazing. At the Fernow
   Experimental Forest in West Virginia, USA, it is most often associated
   with skid roads where uneven-aged silvicultural techniques are being
   tested. We monitored running buffalo clover population trends for seven
   years in two research compartments before and after scheduled
   silvicultural operations. Stern density (stems/m(2)) was declining in
   both compartments prior to planned silvicultural operations, and
   ground-based,kidding caused a further reduction in the number of running
   buffalo clover locations and stems. Running buffalo clover began to
   increase in density two years after the logging. Running buffalo clover
   excluded from ground disturbance increased in the second growing season
   following tree removal, but had declined by the third season. Running
   buffalo clover subjected to ground disturbance continued to increase in
   density during, the third growing season. Canopy gaps, leaf area index,
   associated plants, and abiotic factors were compared between 35 sites
   supporting running buffalo clover and an, equal number of randomly
   chosen site,, in a third research compartment that had not been
   disturbed by silvicultural operations for 15 years. Running buffalo
   clover sites had greater gap areas and lower leaf area indexes than
   average for the whole compartment. Several herbaceous species, including
   Panicum L. spp., Eupatorium rugosum Houttuyn, and Amphicarpaea,
   bructeata (L.) Fern., were found more frequently at sites supporting
   running buffalo clover than would be predicted by chance. Preliminary
   results indicate that controlling, the intensity of surface disturbance,
   combined with the reduction in canopy density associated,with
   uneven-aged silviculture,. ill help sustain populations of running
   buffalo clover in managed forests.}},

Abstract = {{Brassica napus microspore cultures are excellent systems for studying
   embryogenesis in plants because they are single celled, induced by a
   simple heat treatment and produce structures that are very similar to
   zygotic embryos. A method for detecting embryogenic cells that is based
   on a surface marker would be useful for studying the early events in
   this developmental process.
   Since the production of a cellulosic cell wall is thought to be a
   characteristic of embryogenic cells in these cultures, a flow cytometric
   method for monitoring cells producing cellulose, after staining with
   calcofluor white, was developed.
   Results showed that the induced cultures developed a unique population
   of cellulose-containing cells. On the basis of their morphology, these
   cells were identified as the embryogenic cells after flow cytometric
   sorting.
   The study also documented the development of embryogenic and
   nonembryogenic cells in microspore cultures over a 4-d period on the
   basis of their cellulose content and size.}},

Abstract = {{As part of product-performance and wildlife-hazards studies of 2\% zinc
   phosphide (Zn3P2) steam-rolled-oat baits (11.2 kg ha(-1)) to reduce vole
   populations (Microtus spp) in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), we used
   randomly located, brushed-dirt plots (eight similar to930-cm(2) plots
   per 0.2-ha enclosure) to monitor bait-broadcast and -removal patterns,
   as well as to index vole and avian sign. Research was conducted in 18 x
   0.2-ha enclosures containing 2.5-year-old stands of alfalfa; a 2-day
   pre-bait (placebo baits broadcast in all enclosures) period followed by
   a 14-day test-bait period (placebo and 2\% Zn3P2 baits in nine
   enclosures each) characterized the bait exposures. Baits were broadcast
   manually by two certified pesticide applicators (CPAs) using Spyker(R)
   Model-75 spreaders. Baits that fell onto plots were counted <30 min
   later to assess the uniformity of bait distribution. The main
   statistical design was a 2 (placebo or Zn3P2 baits) x 3 (vole-only,
   vole-pheasant, vole-quail exposures) x 14 (days) factorial, with days
   considered repeated measurements. In the six vole-only enclosures, baits
   were removed from the brushed-dirt plots and replaced with four 0\% or
   2\% Zn3P2 baits (one per 232.6-cm(2) quadrant; 32 per enclosure); these
   `placed' baits were then monitored daily for removal, while the surfaces
   of all plots were monitored daily for the presence: absence of
   animal/bird sign. Key results were: (a) 3.51(+/-2.66) and 3.39(+/-3.52)
   mean (+/-SD) baits were found on plots after pre-bait and test-bait
   broadcasts, respectively-less than the predicted 4.52 particles per
   930-cm(2) plot; (b) baits `placed' on plots in placebo-baited enclosures
   were removed earlier than those in Zn3P2-baited enclosures-data in
   agreement with observed vole mortality; and (c) species x bait
   interactions occurred for both the vole- and pheasant-sign counts, but
   not quail-sign counts-data also indirectly confirming Zn3P2- induced
   mortality effects on voles and pheasants. This technique has utility for
   a variety of wildlife biology and chemical registration studies;
   although limited to and conditions, the technique affords useful indices
   of broadcast calibration, bait pick-up, as well as target and non-target
   species mortality. Published in 2002 for SCI by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Previous vegetation studies in the Kruger National Park have shown a
   dramatic decline in the density of large trees in four major vegetation
   units of the Park. An assessment of the damage status of Sclerocarya
   birrea (marula), identified as one of the most important tree species in
   the Kruger National Park, was conducted across three major landscapes of
   the Park. Previous studies indicated that marula were most utilized by
   elephants, resulting in weak regeneration and recruitment, with
   consequent changes to the population structure of the species.
   Furthermore, results indicated that the marula populations in two major
   landscapes of the Kruger National Park were threatened. The objective of
   this study was to generate a data set, which can be used in conjunction
   with future monitoring, to quantify the elephant damage to the marula
   population in the Kruger National Park. Results indicated that almost
   half the surveyed population suffered from damage due to elephant
   activity, predominantly in the form of bark stripping and felling.
   Felling resulted in a large proportion of marula trees being reduced to
   a height of less than five metres. Main stem breakage by elephant was
   the main cause of the 7\% mortality observed in the marula population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the history of the feral cat eradication programme on
   sub-Antarctic Marion Island based on unpublished minutes of meetings,
   reports, letters, theses and published scientific papers; and reflects
   on the outcome of the eradication campaign. The 19-year programme
   comprised seven phases, commencing with a description of the effect of
   the cats on the Marion Island ecosystem, the characteristics of the cat
   population and the formulation of a management policy (phase 1:
   1974-1976). Methods for control were selected and preparations were made
   for the implementation of the primary control measure, biological
   control with the feline panleucopaenia virus (phase 2: 1976/77). The
   virus was released in 1977 (phase 3: 1977), followed by the
   determination of its effects (phase 4: 1977-1980). Monitoring of the
   effects of the virus continued, and the secondary control measure of
   hunting at night was tested (phase 5: 1981-1983). Full-scale
   implementation of hunting and continued monitoring of the effects of
   both the disease and hunting followed (phase 6: 1986-1989). The
   inclusion of intensive trapping and poisoning as tertiary control
   measures culminated in the final eradication of cats from Marion Island
   in 1991 (phase 7: 1989-1993).}},

Abstract = {{We report here on some shore-based killer whale observations that were
   collected at several localities around Marion Island (46degrees54'S;
   37degrees45'E) in a single day during their peak activity period around
   the island. Using island wide observational data we mapped the movement
   patterns of killer whales, which were restricted to the east coast and
   may be related to breeding and moulting aggregations of southern
   elephant seals found there. We estimated the killer whale population at
   Marion Island to be in the range of 25-30 individuals. Movement of
   individually identified pods between adjacent observation points
   suggested estimated swimming speeds of between 11.9 km/h and 14.44 km/h
   while patrolling along the Marion Island beaches. No diel activity
   pattern was evident. We stress the need for more data similar to that
   obtained in the present study in order to render observations and
   monitoring of killer whales from a single point on the island
   meaningful.}},

Abstract = {{The Mexico City Metropolitan Zone (ZMCM) population's exposure to
   benzene, toluene and xylene was measured at different microenvironments
   to establish basic indicators of the presence and effects of these
   characteristic volatile organic compounds (VOC). In particular, VOC
   personal exposures were measured in different microenvironments during a
   5-day working week, with 12-h daily periods. We have found a good
   agreement of our results with the registered VOC levels of the
   Metropolitan Automated Monitor System (RAMA) for the corresponding
   period. From our results, we expect to generate useful information to
   evaluate the health effects of these VOCs on exposed people. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Recent studies on separated particle-size fractions highlight the health
   significance of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mum (PM2.5), but
   gravimetric methods do not identify specific particle sources. Diesel
   exhaust particles (DEP) contain elemental carbon (EC), the dominant
   light-absorbing substance in the atmosphere. Black smoke (BS) is a
   measure for light absorption of PM and, thus, an alternative way to
   estimating EC concentrations, which may serve as a proxy for diesel
   exhaust emissions. We analyzed PM2.5 and BS data collected within the
   EXPOLIS study (Air Pollution Exposure Distribution within Adult Urban
   Populations in Europe) In Athens, Basel, Helsinki, and Prague. 186
   indoor/outdoor filter pairs were sampled and analyzed. PM2.5 and BS
   levels were lowest in Helsinki, moderate in Basel, and remarkably higher
   in Athens and Prague. In each city, Spearman correlation coefficients of
   indoor versus outdoor were higher for BS (range r(Spearman): 0.57-0.86)
   than for PM2.5 (0.05-0.69). In a BS linear regression model (all data),
   outdoor levels explained clearly more of indoor variation (86\%) than in
   the corresponding PM2.5 model (59\%). In conclusion, ambient BS seizes a
   health-relevant fraction of fine particles to which people are exposed
   indoors and outdoors and exposure to which can be assessed by monitoring
   outdoor concentrations, BS measured on PM2.5 filters can be recommended
   as a valid and cheap additional indicator in studies on
   combustion-related air pollution and health.}},

Abstract = {{Two catchment studies were undertaken in Argyll, West Scotland to test
   the efficacy of the Forestry Commission's Forests and Water Guidelines
   in controlling diffuse pollution from forestry. The first involved the
   peaty catchment of the Clachaig Water, which provides the potable supply
   for the villages of Muasdale and Glenbarr. Thirty-five percent of the
   area was ploughed and drained in spring 1990 and subsequently fertilised
   with rock phosphate. The water supply catchment of the Gleann Sabhail
   Burn at Tayvallich provided the second site for study. Following the
   construction of a 2.5 km length of forest road, around 40\% of the
   catchment was harvested over a 4-year period. Forest management
   practices followed the working methods and measures described in the
   Guidelines. Water samples were collected at regular intervals from the
   water supply intakes to determine the impact of these practices on water
   quality, particularly on sediment release and water colour. The benthic
   macroinvertebrate fauna at both sites and the trout population at
   Tayvallich, were also monitored. Results showed that water quality was
   relatively unaffected by all of the forestry operations, with water
   clarity remaining high. No disruption was caused to the public water
   supply in either catchment. Impacts on stream biology were small and
   limited to a short-term decline in the number of macroinvertebrate taxa
   at one site at Tayvallich, due to the localised accumulation of brash
   and silt. There was no clear evidence of harvesting operations having an
   impact on the trout population. Overall, the Guidelines were effective
   in limiting site damage and minimising the impact of forest operations
   on the freshwater environment. The study demonstrates that good forest
   management can effectively control the threat of diffuse pollution
   within sensitive water catchments. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{To estimate levels of organochlorine residuals in the Japanese
   population and the contribution of dietary factors to these levels, we
   determined serum levels of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH),
   hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p'-DDD),
   1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE) and
   p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) in 41 volunteers (14 men
   and 27 women) in a rural area of Northern Japan. These organochlorine
   levels were measured using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry. By a
   self-administered dietary history questionnaire, the usual dietary
   intake was estimated. Their median levels (range) were as follows:
   beta-HCH, 0.50 (0.05-1.50); HCB, 0.20 (0.02-0.70); and total DDT
   (p,p'-DDE + p,p'-DDT), 5.0 (0.9-31.0) ng/ml serum. Levels of p,p'-DDD
   were detected in only seven subjects (0.05-0.6 ng/ml serum). The
   beta-HCH levels were increased with rice and milk intakes, but the least
   squares means were not simply increased according to the quartile of the
   intakes. Concerning HCB, fish intake showed a borderline significant
   correlation (0.20, P = 0.052). In terms of total DDT, intakes of meat,
   fish, vegetable and milk showed a positive relationship. although none
   of them provided statistically significant results. No other
   statistically significant relation between my organochlorines and any
   food intakes examined was observed in this study. The present study
   suggests that organochlorine compounds are transported into the human
   body via foods in the Japanese population, Their effects on health
   should thus be investigated and monitored. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The black rhino in Africa is slowly recovering from poaching. This has
   been achieved in part by maintaining ongoing monitoring as part of
   intensive protection and biological management. However, the efficacy of
   population monitoring methods has not been assessed. Rhino surveillance
   records and rainfall data were used to determine which ecological and
   operational factors affected monthly rhino sightings by vehicle patrols
   in Masai Mara, Kenya. Comparisons of sightings capture rates using
   different ground-based and aerial methods were also conducted. Stepwise
   multiple regression revealed a model (adjusted R-2 = 0.66) predicting
   monthly rhino sightings with four significant factors; number of
   patrols, rhino population size, rainfall over the previous 2 months and
   a dummy variable for the month of August. The latter two variables
   represent the negative effects of long grass growth and the annual
   wildebeest migration on rhino sightings, and result in seasonal
   deficiencies in monitoring. During vehicle patrols, 51\% of sightings
   were made whilst moving, and 49\% were made whilst stationary and
   scanning with binoculars, although sightings capture rate was an order
   of magnitude higher when stationary. Equally, sightings capture rate
   from hot air balloons was twice that during vehicle-based patrols,
   although with less accuracy of identification. The introduction of foot
   patrols would increase patrol cost-effectiveness and fill seasonal
   troughs, thereby providing better all-round surveillance.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of breeding Antarctic shags (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis) was
   investigated at four colonies on the Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula,
   by the analysis of 616 pellets (regurgitated casts) collected from
   December 1997 to February 1998. Overall, demersal-benthic fish were the
   most frequent and important prey at all the colonies, followed by
   octopods and gastropods. Amongst fish, Notothenia coriiceps was the main
   prey in all of the sampling sites, followed in similar importance by
   Gobionotothen gibberifrons at Cape Herschel, Primavera Island and Midas
   Island and in less importance by Harpagifer antarcticus at Py Point.
   There were marked differences among colonies in the size of the fish
   consumed. The largest and the smallest specimens were eaten by shags
   from Midas Island and Py Point respectively. This was mainly influenced
   by the number of specimens of the smallest fish species, H. antarcticus,
   consumed at Py Point, The differences in the diet composition maybe
   related to the different foraging areas used by the shags, Results from
   this study differ from previous studies around the Antarctic Peninsula.
   The shags at the Danco Coast preyed markedly more intensively than those
   at the South Shetland Islands on G. gibberifirons. This finding reflects
   the low abundance of this fish species in inshore waters (< 100 m depth)
   at the South Shetland Islands and supports the use of the Antarctic
   shags to monitor trends in local populations of coastal fish species.}},

Abstract = {{The authors studied the effects of relatively low doses of nitrogen
   dioxide and respirable suspended particulate matter (i.e., < 2.5 mu) on
   acute respiratory symptoms and on peak expiratory flow in 383 adults
   (115-72 yr of age) who lived in the Po River Delta area, located near
   Venice. During 2 wk-1 wk in winter and 1 wk in summer-the authors
   monitored each participant's house to measure nitrogen dioxide (in parts
   per billion) and respirable suspended particulate (mug/m(3))
   concentration. Information on sex, age, height, weight, daily activity
   patterns, active and passive smoking, chronic respiratory diseases,
   daily peak expiratory flow, and presence of acute respiratory symptoms
   during the weeks monitoring occurred were also collected. Peak
   expiratory flow variation was studied as mean amplitude percentage
   (i.e., amplitude/mean) and percentage of diurnal variation
   (maximum/minimum). The exposure indices to nitrogen dioxide (nitrogen
   dioxide-index of exposure) and to respirable suspended particulate
   matter (respirable suspended particulate matter-index of exposure) were
   computed as the product of pollutant concentration and time of exposure.
   The authors considered indices as ``low{''} or ``high{''} on the basis
   of the median value. The median nitrogen dioxide was 20 ppb in winter
   and 14 ppb in summer; the highest nitrogen dioxide levels occurred in
   the kitchen in the winter (33 ppb) and summer (20 ppb). The median
   respirable suspended particulate matter was 68 mug/m(3) in Winter and 45
   mug/m(3) in summer. Only in winter were there significant associations
   between bronchitic/asthmatic symptoms and ``high{''} nitrogen dioxide
   and respirable suspended particulate matter indices. In subjects who did
   not smoke, a significant influence of the ``high{''} respirable
   suspended particulate matter-index of exposure was also observed in
   summer. With respect to peak expiratory flow and its variability,
   respirable suspended particulate matter-index of exposure was associated
   with an increase of both amplitude/mean and maximum/mean; however, with
   respect to the nitrogen dioxide-index of exposure, the association was
   significant only in subjects with chronic respiratory diseases (i.e.,
   asthma and bronchitis). These relationships were significant only in
   winter. In conclusion, the results of the current study indicate that
   there is an association between relatively low doses of pollutants and
   acute respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow in adults.}},

Abstract = {{Hunter-based beluga monitoring programs, in place in the Mackenzie Delta
   since 1973 and in the Paulatuk, Northwest Territories, area since 1989,
   have resulted in collection of data on the number of whales harvested
   and on the efficiency of the hunts. Since 1980, data on the standard
   length, fluke width, sex, and age of the landed whales have also been
   collected. The number of belugas landed each year averaged 131.8 (SD
   26.5, n = 1337) between 1970 and 1979, 124.0 (SD 23.3, n = 1240) between
   1980 and 1989, and 111.0 (SD 19.0, n = 1110) between 1990 and 1999. The
   human population increased during this same period. Removal of belugas
   from the Beaufort Sea stock, including landed whales taken in the
   Alaskan harvests, is estimated at 189 per year. The sex ratio of landed
   belugas from the Mackenzie Estuary was 2.3 males: I female. Median ages
   were 23.5 yr (47 growth layer groups {[}GLG]) for females (n = 80) and
   24 yr (48 GLG) for males (n = 286). More than 92\% of an aged sample (n
   = 368) from the harvest consisted of whales 10 or more years old (20
   GLG). The rate of removal is small in relation to the expected maximum
   net productivity rate of this stock. The continued availability of
   large, old individuals after centuries of harvesting and the apparent
   lack of change in the size and age structure of the catch in recent
   years also support a conclusion that the present level of harvest is
   sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{24-h PM2.5 carbonaceous samples were collected between 27 November and 9
   December 1999 in Seoul, and between 7 and 20 June 2000 in Kwangju to
   investigate characteristics of carbonaceous species, and the
   relationship between elemental carbon (EC) and Aethalometer-based black
   carbon (BC) measurements. 5-min PM2.5 BC and criteria air pollutant data
   were also measured using the Aethalometer and ambient air monitoring
   system. The PM2.5 samples were analyzed for EC and OC using a selective
   thermal manganese dioxide oxidation (TMO) method. The daily average EC
   and OC concentrations in Seoul were higher in the winter than in the
   summer (Atmos. Environ. 35 (2001a) 657). It was found that difference
   between ambient BC levels in the two cities was not directly
   proportional to the population ratio (similar to8) or diesel traffic
   ratio (similar to5.9) since particulate matter or BC concentration is
   strongly influenced by a result of varying traffic and meteorological
   conditions at the site. Using the primary OC/EC ratio approach, the
   results suggest that most of the measured OC in Kwangju is of primary
   origin during the summer. In Seoul, the observed OC includes additional
   secondary organic aerosol during the wintertime conditions. The
   relationship between the 24-h TMO-EC and Aethalometer BC measurements in
   PM2.5 reflected very good agreement for the two urban sites. with
   correlation coefficients of R-2 = 0.99 and 0.92, and BC/EC slopes of
   0.93 and 1.07, respectively. It was found that comparing TMO-EC to BC at
   a different location in Korea, a different scaling factor was needed.

Abstract = {{Spoon-billed Sandpiper Eurynorhynchus pygmeus is classed as globally
   Vulnerable, based on the only available population estimate, made in
   1977, Of 2,000-2,800 pairs. Surveys for breeding Spoon-billed Sandpipers
   were carried out in summer 2000 on the Anadyr estuary coast, the
   Chukotka autonomous region, Russia. Although six new breeding sites were
   found, only 16-17 breeding males/pairs were recorded on the northern
   coast of the Anadyr estuary and five males/pairs on the southern coast
   and more southerly lagoons. These numbers were much lower than expected,
   and the species was not recorded in several apparently suitable areas.
   Four formerly known breeding sites held only one displaying male between
   them. At no site was there evidence of an increasing or stable local
   population. Together with other indicative data these suggest a sharp
   decline in the population of Spoon-billed Sandpiper. The previous
   population size estimate obviously requires updating, both because there
   were some incorrect assumptions in the calculations made for the first
   population estimate, and also due to a recent population decline. It is
   likely that the current population numbers under 1,000 breeding pairs.
   Given that the population of this species may be substantially lower
   than the only previous estimate, and the evidence for a possible rapid
   decline in its population described in this paper, it is recommended
   that its IUCN status is changed from Vulnerable to Endangered. No
   reasons for the apparent rapid rate of decline are evident within the
   breeding range. ``Bottle-necks{''} should be looked for at migration
   sites or wintering grounds, but currently, monitoring of the population
   is only possible on the breeding grounds.}},

Abstract = {{The Moroccan population of Great Bustard Otis tarda was surveyed in the
   four years 1998-2001. Highest numbers were counted in December 1998 (21
   males, 62-65 females, four first-year males: total c. go) and March 2001
   (15 males, 60-66 females, four first-year males: total 75-81). Combining
   enquiry results from local people with these data, the population size
   for spring is estimated at 92-111 individuals, and 117-133 for winter.
   Reproduction is confirmed. Threats to the population include illegal
   hunting, habitat loss through agricultural intensification (irrigation,
   use of pesticides) and infrastructural changes (construction of a
   motorway and a powerplant), disturbance, and accidents at powerlines and
   antennas. Several conservation measures are suggested: cease hunting;
   maximize the attention given to display sites; encourage villagers to
   carry out ``Great Bustard-friendly{''} land use and adapt animal stocks
   to the carrying capacity of their regions; clarify the situation of
   genetic exchange between Spanish and Moroccan populations; study

Abstract = {{Little is known about Mexican Duck Anas diazi biology and populations.
   We analyse long-term (1960-2000) trends of Mexican Duck numbers in
   Mexico and employ contemporary count data (1991-2000) from the U.S. Fish
   and Wildlife Service midwinter surveys to identify key sites for
   conservation using a complementarity approach. The overall Mexican Duck
   population showed a significant long-term increase Of 2.5\% per year,
   with large fluctuations throughout the study period. The Northern
   highlands population increased at an annual rate Of 7.7\%, while the
   Central highlands population showed no significant long-term trend.
   During the last decade, counts in both the Northern and Central
   highlands exhibited no significant change. At the site level,
   significant long-term increases occurred in four localities in the
   Northern highlands (Laguna BabPcora +13.9\% annually, Laguna Bustillos
   +25.9\%, Laguna Mexicanos +20.4\% and Laguna Santiaguillo +16.9\%) and
   in three localities in the Central highlands (Languillo +15.3\%
   annually, Presa Solis +8.9\%, Zacapu +13.4\%). Two sites in the Central
   highlands showed significant declines, in the long term (Lago de
   Chapala, -5.2\% per year) and during the last decade (Lerma, -11.8\% per
   year). The Northern highlands held 16\% and the Central highlands 84\%
   of the Mexican Duck population in the period 1960-2000; during the last
   decade, these figures were 31\% and 69\%, respectively. A set of
   priority sites for conservation of the Mexican Duck was identified,
   consisting of 15 sites holding more than 70\% of the midwinter Mexican
   Duck counts in Mexico. Ten sites from the priority set also qualify for
   designation as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar
   Convention on Wetlands, by holding greater than or equal to1\% of the
   estimated population. Four of the priority sites are in the Northern
   highlands and 11 in the Central highlands, of which eight are
   distributed along the Rio Lerma drainage. The most urgent actions that
   need to be undertaken are to estimate the current minimum population
   size in Mexico; to establish a programme for monitoring populations in
   the priority sites, especially those located within the highly degraded
   Rio Lerma drainage; and to determine the most feasible management
   actions for the species, concentrating efforts around the priority
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Sangihe, Indonesia, was visited in 1998-99 with the aim of
   producing population estimates of the island's endemic and other
   restricted-range bird species, some of which were poorly known and
   thought to be at risk of extinction due to habitat change. The study
   focused on the last remaining patch of primary forest, on Mount
   Sahendaruman in southern Sangihe, home to three critically endangered
   endemic species: Cerulean Paradise-flycatcher Eutrichomyias rowleyi,
   Sangihe Shrike-thrush Colluricincla sanghirensis, and Sangihe White-eye
   Zosterops nehrkorni. Population densities were estimated from primary
   forest and secondary habitats across Sangihe to assess species
   dependency on primary habitat. Twenty Of 24 restricted-range, globally
   threatened or endemic taxa were recorded and density estimates were
   calculated for 15 of these. The endemic Red-and-blue Lory Eos histrio is
   extinct on Sangihe as a result of lowland forest loss. Six species
   (Nicobar Pigeon Caloenas nicobarica, Sulawesi Dwarf Kingfisher Ceyx
   fallax, Golden Bulbul Ixos affinis, E. rowleyi, C. sanghirensis, and Z.
   nehrkorni) were either not recorded or have very small populations and
   are critically endangered on Sangihe; two species of Tanygnathus parrot
   are also facing local extinction on the island. The major threat to all
   these species is the destruction of primary forest; larger species are
   also threatened by hunting. The remaining endemic and restricted-range
   species (Blue-tailed Imperial Pigeon Ducula concinna, Sangihe
   Hanging-parrot Loriculus catamene, Sangihe Scops-owl Otus collari,
   Lilac-cheeked Kingfisher Cittura cyanotis and Elegant Sunbird Aethopyga
   duyvenbodei) were more widespread and occurred in secondary habitats. I
   recommend that L. catamene and A. duyvenbodei, currently treated as
   globally endangered, be reclassified as near-threatened and vulnerable
   respectively because of their large populations and tolerance of
   disturbed habitats. Species with wide global ranges that are represented
   by endemic subspecies have the greatest tolerance for disturbed habitat.
   The widespread deforestation of Sangihe has had serious consequences for
   many bird species and today the island supports the most threatened
   assemblage of single-island endemic species in Indonesia.
   Species-specific research to determine the status and ecology of E.
   rowleyi, C. sanghirensis and Z. nehrkorni, and monitoring of the
   Sahendaruman forest are desperately needed as a basis for future
   conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres is endemic to southern Africa and is
   globally threatened. Colonies in Botswana comprise part of one of the
   two core breeding areas in the species's range, and very little has
   previously been published about them. Ground censusing of 11 Cape
   Vulture sites in Botswana was undertaken from 1992 to 1999, continuing a
   monitoring programme initiated by the authors in 1984. Survey methods
   and census procedures are documented. The potential Cape Vulture
   breeding population in Botswana is estimated to be about 600 pairs,
   comprising at least loo pairs at Mannyelanong in the south-east and
   about 500 pairs in eastern Botswana. This represents an increase from
   previous estimates, and reflects improved census techniques rather than
   an increase in population size. The mean turnover rate of nest site
   usage from one year to the next averaged 21\% at Mannyelanong, and was
   about 26\% at Manong Yeng in eastern Botswana. Annual productivity of
   nest sites increased with the number of years the site had been
   occupied. Over the eight years of study eggs were laid in at least 436
   Of 477 nests (91.4\%) at Mannyelanong; chicks survived to mid season
   (60-80 days old) in 327 nests (75\% of eggs laid), and fledged (best
   estimate) in 248 nests (56.9\% of eggs laid and 52\% of pairs attempting
   to breed). In eastern Botswana eggs were laid in at least 1,825 Of 2,101
   nests (86.9\%); chicks survived to mid season in 1,272 nests (69.7\% of
   eggs laid). Two seasons have been excluded for eastern Botswana (1994
   and 1995) due to incomplete data, and breeding success can be estimated
   only from 1997 to 1999: of 990 eggs laid out of 1,108 nests, chicks
   fledged in 384 nests (38.8\% of eggs laid and 34.6\% of pairs attempting
   to breed). The eastern Botswana breeding population remains in a state
   of flux following the collapse of a primary colony that was the
   country's Cape Vulture stronghold. Conservation concerns and the
   vulnerability of Cape Vulture sites are discussed.}},

   Methods A random sample of tetrads (2 x 2 km squares) was surveyed from
   the known breeding range (as defined from the two national breeding bird
   atlases of 1968-72 and 1988-91). The survey method used tape playback
   and observation and involved walking four parallel transects in each

Abstract = {{Capsule The first Britain-wide survey of Spotted Crakes Parzana parzana
   undertaken in 1999 recorded 73 singing males mostly in wet herb habitats
   with peak records in May.
   Aims To provide baseline information on the number and distribution of
   breeding Spotted Crakes and a description of their preferred habitat in
   Britain.
   Methods Volunteers and site wardens/managers visited sites at which
   Spotted Crakes had been recorded 1988-98. High priority sites were
   visited once a week during May and June (at least eight visits), while
   remaining sites each received three visits. General habitat data were
   collected, both from an area of 5 m x 5 m surrounding the Spotted Crake
   singing locations and from ten randomly selected 5 m x 5 m squares
   within sites.
   Results Seventy-three singing male Spotted Crakes were recorded at 29
   sites in England, Wales and Scotland during May and June. Seven
   additional singing males were recorded outside the survey period, and at
   three sites juveniles were seen yet no song was heard. Records peaked in
   May, although Spotted Crakes sang later in the north. At the landscape
   level, singing Spotted Crakes were characterized by dominant wet herb
   species, 35\% standing water (4.5-17.3 cm deep) and tall (>70 cm)
   vegetation. Within sites, Spotted Crake chose more mosaic vegetation,
   characterized by wet grass species, greater water cover and shorter
   vegetation.
   Conclusion Spotted crakes are more than a sporadic breeding visitor to
   Britain, but better monitoring is required to understand the population
   trends. A basic insight into habitat preferences provides a starting
   point for further studies.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of felt egg traps to detect oviposition by the cabbage
   maggot, Delia radicum (L.), was studied under field conditions for
   cabbage, Brassica olcracea L. var. capitata L. (Brassicaceae), and
   rutabaga, Brassica napus L. var. napobrassica (L.) Reichenb.
   (Brassicaceae), in 1994 and 1995. The numbers of eggs laid on traps were
   compared with the numbers deposited in the soil next to the plant. Also,
   the incidence of oviposition (i.e., the percentage of samples with eggs)
   on soil and traps was compared. A total of 5160 eggs was collected from
   5208 samples, but just 16\% of all samples had eggs. For cabbage, early
   in the 1994 season, the incidence of oviposition in soil samples was
   double that on traps, and the number of eggs per sample was greater
   also. Oviposition incidence and the number of eggs per sample during the
   rest of the summer were similar. In the 1995 cabbage trial, the
   incidence of oviposition early in the season was again higher in soil
   samples than on traps, and there were fewer eggs per trap than per soil
   sample. For rutabaga, the number of eggs was similar using both methods
   early in the second generation, but from mid-August there were more eggs
   per trap than per soil sample. The incidence of oviposition in the
   rutabaga trial was similar on traps and in soil through most of the
   experiment. In this study, felt traps did not adequately detect the
   timing of cabbage maggot oviposition in the critical early season.}},

   cause-specific mortality of 25 female and 11 male radio-marked adult
   (>1.0 year old) white-lipped peccaries monitored during February 1995 -
   February 2001 in Corcovado National Park, their largest stronghold in
   Costa Rica. Annual survival was lower for female (0.78; 95\% CI =
   0.68-0.88) than for male (0.94; 95\% CI = 0.86-1.00) peccaries. Both
   sexes were poached and died in accidents but only females were killed by
   predators or died of unknown causes (but not poaching). In comparison
   with the demography of collared peccaries (Tayassu tajacu), the
   population of white-lipped peccaries in Corcovado National Park may be
   maintaining itself. Still, protected areas may need to be expanded and
   (or) more forcefully monitored to sustain white-lipped peccaries
   throughout their range if additional use by humans is likely to occur,

Abstract = {{In the 1950s, a production plant of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) was
   established in Brazil with the main purpose of producing chemicals for
   vectors control. This factory was closed down in 1955 and around 300
   tons of production residues were left behind in the open air. In 1995,
   the area was treated with lime to eliminate the HCH contamination. Soil
   sample gave a PCDD/F concentration of 13 900 ng I-TEQ/kg whereas samples
   from the neighborhood ranged from 0.19 to 2.08 ng I-TEQ/kg. PCDD/F
   levels in cow's milk samples varied from 4.1 to 6.5 pg I-TEQ/g of milk
   fat. High concentration in soil collected from the site suggests that
   treatment and recovery shall be made. Further dioxin monitoring is
   needed to better estimate the risk posed to local population through
   food consumption and soil usage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The atmospheric contamination levels of polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were
   evaluated from the analysis of pine needles in South Korea. Pine needles
   were collected from 30 sampling points at five main cities in South
   Korea (Busan, Daegu, Gwangju, Changwon and Jeju island). The highest
   concentrations of PCDDs/DFs (2.19-26.88 pg I-TEQ/g of dry weight) were
   measured at Busan, where is the city of the highest population density
   and traffic volume among five cities. The lowest concentration was
   detected at Jeju with 0.62 pg I-TEQ/g dry weight, suggesting Jeju could
   be an environmental background area in Korea. The dominant homologues of
   PCDDs/DFs in pine needles were the lower chlorine-substituted compounds
   such as tetra CDDs and CDFs, and the distribution ratios of PCDDs/DFs
   decreased with increase of the number of chlorine substituents.
   Homologue profiles of pine needle samples were similar to PCDDs/DFs
   profiles of the vapor phase in the ambient air, and thus the pine
   needles absorbed the vapor phase of PCDDs/DFs from air. Results
   suggested that pine needles could be used as an indicator of the
   atmospheric contamination for PCDDs/DFs in Korea. (C) 2002 Published by

Abstract = {{Natal dispersal is of central interest when determining demography, and
   genetic structure of populations and managing endangered species with
   fragmented distributions. However, methodological limitations linked to
   spatial and temporal constraints have prevented studies of natal
   dispersal in long-lived birds. Moreover, the consequences of natal
   dispersal have mainly been related to the first breeding attempt rather
   than to lifetime reproductive success. We studied the causes and Fitness
   consequences of natal dispersal in a population of Black Kites at Donana
   National Park (southern Spain). From 1986 to 1995 we marked 2929
   nestlings with plastic numbered bands. We annually monitored marked
   birds in breeding territories, their breeding success, and the survival
   of nonbreeding birds. Additionally, we searched for marked birds in
   broad areas of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Median natal
   dispersal distance was 4.8 km (N = 285), with males more often
   dispersing shorter distances and females dispersing at all distance
   categories equally. Density of conspecifics negatively affected
   dispersal distances of both males and females. In addition, single and
   first-hatched males born in areas with high breeding density dispersed
   shorter distances. Dispersal distances tended to be correlated between
   siblings. possibly a result of sharing similar environmental conditions.
   We did not find evidence that dispersal was an active mechanism aimed to
   prevent close inbreeding. Patterns of dispersal in this population are
   probably driven by intraspecific competition. Males that dispersed
   shorter distances showed higher lifetime reproductive success (LRS). LRS
   did not differ among females dispersing different distances, but females
   that dispersed farther mated with more experienced males. These sex
   differences in dispersal patterns and their consequences may be
   explained by the inequality between sexes in breeding roles in this
   species. Familiarity with the natal area could be important for males,
   which defend territories and resources, while females may increase their
   fitness through mate choice and breeding dispersal. High levels of
   philopatry in Donana National Park may be a result of a surplus of food
   resources and the effects of conspecific attraction in densely populated
   areas. However. the degree of philopatry may vary between populations
   and with time, subject to differences in ecological pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Domestically reared introduced (or escaped) individuals can have
   detrimental genetic effects on the indigenous populations into which
   they are released, Consequently, numerous studies have attempted to
   estimate whether, non-native specimens have contributed to the gene pool
   of wild populations. So far, the key limiting factor of such studies has
   been their lack of appropriate baseline genetic material. Here,
   microsatellite DNA analyses of historical scale samples and contemporary
   wild and introduced populations were used to assess spatiotemporal
   population structure and stocking effects among endangered Lake Saimaa
   (eastern Finland) grayling (Thymallus thymallus,Salmonidae). Significant
   decreases in genetic differentiation were detected between wild and
   introduced populations since the commencement of stocking in 1986.
   Accordingly, up to 15\% of the contemporary wild grayling were
   confidently identified to be of pure hatchery origin, and recent
   hybridization between the hatchery and indigenous individuals appeared
   likely. Despite these clear genetic imprints of stocking, the
   contemporary populations exhibited evolutionary relationships congruent
   with the sampling locations, and up to 73\% of contemporary individuals
   were identified to be of pure indigenous origin. The use of historical
   baseline material should prove efficient for monitoring gene flow
   between domesticated and wild populations in other species also, e.g.
   salmonids, game animals and plants.}},

Abstract = {{Synopsis
   For over a decade, we have been studying the reproductive behavior of
   the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, in the Dry Torugas off the
   Florida Keys, an important mating and nursery ground for this species.
   In the course of these studies, we have used a variety of tags and
   tagging protocols to monitor individual animals. Here we report the use
   of molecular methods for the genetic analysis of nurse sharks.
   Specifically we have analyzed genetic variation at the MHC II alpha
   locus using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction
   fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the amplified products.
   We found this technique to be a relatively rapid and reliable method for
   identifying genetic differences between individual sharks. Applying this
   method to a family of sharks consisting of a mother and 32 pups, we
   demonstrate that at least four fathers must have fathered this brood.
   Multiple paternity in the nurse shark suggests a mechanism by which
   populations of this species may maximize genetic variability. This seems
   especially valuable for philopatric species whose migratory movement,
   and thus potential for genetic diversity, is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Both heterotrophs and autotrophic nitrifiers are present in aerobic
   sludge digestion systems. The endogenous heterotrophic metabolism
   releases ammonium that, via oxidation to nitrite and nitrate, serves as
   the energy substrate for growth and survival of nitrifiers. The
   population interaction was used to explain the two-phase decay behavior
   observed in this study for the biosolids collected from rotating
   biological contactors (RBC) as well as the mixed primary and secondary
   sludge. Separated by an intermediate transition, the two phases followed
   different first-order decay kinetics, with the first phase being much
   faster. The two-phase phenomenon was supported by the on-line
   fluorescence profile monitored by an NAD(P)H fluorometer. The
   fluorescence showed an initial rise to a high plateau, a sharp decline
   after staying at the plateau for 30-50 h, and a trailing very slow
   decrease. The initial plateau corresponded to the first-phase of rapid
   sludge digestion; the trailing fluorescence decline corresponded to the
   second phase of slow digestion. The transition between the two phases
   occurred during the sharp decline from the plateau. The fluorescence
   profile was consistent with our earlier observation of negligible
   NAD(P)H fluorescence from nitrifiers compared to that from heterotrophs.
   The VSS reduction was, therefore, modeled by considering the decay and
   interaction of heterotrophs and nitrifiers. The model described the
   experimental results very well. The best-fit average decay constants
   were 0.067 d(-1) for nitrifiers and 0.95 d(-1) for heterotrophs in the
   RBC biosolids. The apparent heterotrophic decay constants (in the
   presence of nonbiomass VSS) were found to be 0.48-0.55 d(-1), consistent
   among different runs of mixed sludge digestion.}},

Abstract = {{Direct measurement of the accumulation of non-radioactive trace elements
   in aquatic biota near uranium mining or processing sites has been
   relatively rare, with greater focus on the radiological activity in the
   adjacent soils and groundwater. To evaluate the potential ecological
   concern associated with trace elements at a former uranium mill site in
   southeastern Utah, benthic macroinvertebrates were collected and
   analyzed for 17 trace elements from multiple locations within a small
   on-site stream, Montezuma Creek, and a nearby reference stream. Key
   questions of this study relate to the spatial and temporal extent of
   contamination in aquatic biota, the potential ecological risks
   associated with that contamination, and the usefulness of benthic
   macroinvertebrates as a monitoring tool at this site. Composite samples
   of similar macroinvertebrate taxa and functional feeding groups were
   collected from each site over a two year period that was representative
   of normal and dry-year conditions. In both years, mean concentrations of
   arsenic, molybdenum, selenium, and vanadium were significantly higher (a
   factor of 2-4 times; P < 0.05) in macroinvertebrates collected from one
   or both of the two Montezuma Creek sites immediately downstream of the
   mill tailing site in comparison to concentrations from reference
   locations. Mean uranium concentrations in invertebrates immediately
   downstream of the mill site were more than 10 times higher than at
   reference sites. The site-to-site pattern of contamination in Montezuma
   Creek invertebrates was similar in 1995 and 1996, with mill-related
   trace elements showing a downstream decreasing trend. However, nine of
   seventeen contaminant concentrations were higher in the second year of
   the study, possibly due to a higher influx of deep groundwater during
   the drier second year of the study. A preliminary assessment of
   ecological risks, based on the benthic macroinvertebrate bioaccumulation
   data, suggests that aquatic and terrestrial population risks are low.
   Benthic macroinvertebrates appeared to be sensitive integrators of trace
   element inputs to the aquatic environment from a former uranium mill
   tailing site, and provided useful spatial and temporal patterns of
   contamination not easily obtained using conventional surface water or
   groundwater measures.}},

Abstract = {{Techniques for estimation of absolute abundance of wildlife Populations
   have received a lot of attention in recent years, The statistical
   research has been focused on intensive small-scale studies. Recently.
   however. wildlife biologists have desired to study populations of
   animals at very large scales for monitoring purposes. Population indices
   are widely used in these extensive monitoring programs because they are
   inexpensive compared to estimates of absolute abundance. A crucial
   underlying assumption is that the population index (0 is directly
   proportional to the Population density (D), The proportionality
   constant.. is simply the probability of `detection' for animals in the
   survey. As spatial and temporal comparisons of indices are crucial, it
   is necessary to also assume that the probability of detection is
   constant over space and time. Biologists intuitively recognize this when
   they design rigid protocols for the studies where the indices are
   collected. Unfortunately. however, in many field studies the assumption
   is clearly invalid. We believe that the estimation of detection
   probability should be built into the monitoring design through a double
   sampling approach. A large sample of points provides an abundance index,
   and a smaller sub-sample of the same point,, is used to estimate
   detection probability. There is an important need for statistical
   research on the design and analysis of these complex studies. Some basic
   concepts based on actual avian. amphibian, and fish monitoring studies
   are presented in this article. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The endemic marine gastropod Chorus giganteus represents a significant
   part of the benthic biomass subject to heavy exploitation by artisanal
   fisheries in Chile. Overexploitation has restricted its formerly wide
   distribution to few sites, and this study deals with the electrophoretic
   characterisation of three populations from the two main fishing grounds
   in the south coast of Chile (37-39degreesS). While frequency of
   polymorphic loci is high (41-50\%), the observed heterozygosity is low
   (between 0.028 and 0.040) though within the range for molluscs.
   Heterogeneity in allelic frequencies at six polymorphic loci suggests
   potential for population substructuring. All these loci showed
   significant heterozygote deficits. The calculated number of migrants per
   generation (N(e)m = 4.75), based on a Wright's F-ST mean value of 0.05,
   accounts for low gene flow among populations in line with breeding
   behaviour (locally restricted).
   These preliminary results set a baseline for further evaluation of the
   intraspecific genetic diversity of an overexploited mollusc with low
   larval dispersal ability, and hence limited ability for colonisation.

Abstract = {{Populations of Oligonychus perseae Tuttle, Baker and Abbatiello (Acari:
   Tetranychidae) were monitored for 37 weeks in an avocado (Persea
   americana Miller) orchard in Fallbrook California, USA. Three cultural
   control methods were tested to reduce vertical recolonization of avocado
   trees by O. perseae. Control methods examined were: (1) Tanglefoot(R)
   barriers on tree trunks. (2) Removal of ground cover and leaf litter
   under tree canopies, and (3) Tanglefoot(R) barriers combined with ground
   cover removal. All treatments were compared to control trees that were
   not subjected to any of the preceding cultural practices. No significant
   differences in O. perseae populations or O. perseae-induced leaf damage
   were found among trees receiving different treatments. However, aerial
   dispersal activity of O. perseae was found to increase as O. perseae
   populations on monitored avocado trees increased, suggesting that
   populations could have been augmented as now immigrants arrived from
   unmonitored avocado trees or other miscellaneous host plants. The
   phytoseiids Galendromus helveolus (Chant) and G. annectens (De Leon),
   Amblyseius similoides Buchelos and Pritchard, Euseius hibisci (Chant),
   and Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) were also monitored during this
   study. Natural enemy numbers were not adversely affected by cultural
   control attempts targeting O. perseae. Aerial applications of abamectin
   with NR 415 oil for Scirtothrips perseae Nakahara (Thysanoptera:
   Thripidae) had an adverse effect on Galendromus spp., which are
   important predators of O. perseae in avocado orchards.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative analysis of twig growth patterns (TA) from the upper canopy
   of 40 year old beech trees, in two compartments at Wytham Wood near
   Oxford, was carried out for the growth years 1987-1996. Annual growth of
   leader, or primary, shoots and lateral, or secondary, shoots were
   suppressed in drought years, as was the total number of subsidiary
   shoots, while the percentage of acute shoots (growing at 40degrees or
   less to the parent stem) increased. In one compartment, these responses
   were significantly correlated with soil moisture deficit, while in the
   other ozone exposure showed stronger correlations than soil moisture
   deficit. Recovery following the 1990 drought was incomplete before the
   1995 drought caused further growth suppression. suggesting that climate
   change leading to more frequent droughts will have a detrimental effect
   on regenerating beech populations. Reduction of annual primary growth in
   these mature woodland trees was associated with values of seasonal ozone
   exposure (AOT40) below the critical level of 10,000 ppb h set by the
   United Nations Economic Commission for Europe based on open-top chamber
   experiments with beech saplings. The results support the interpretation
   that drought and ozone pollution are important factors in the long term
   decline of beech trees in southern Britain that has been observed using
   Roloff winter twig pattern assessment (RT). There was good correlation
   between the RT canopy score and the percentage of acute shoots,
   supporting the use of the RT winter assessment method to monitor beech
   tree health in the countryside. The study demonstrates that TA methods
   can be valuable in examining detailed tree responses to a changing
   climate and pollution environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{We investigated the impacts of PIT-tagging and tattooing on survival
   condition, and egg laying in Alpine newts (Trituris alpestris) by both
   field and laboratory experiments. A laboratory experiment made it
   possible to compare impacts of each marking technique with control
   groups 4 unmarked newts. This experiment consisted of a 3 x 3 factorial
   plan (population, replication, and marking) using 90 individuals of each
   sex. Neither survival nor body condition were affected by marking. No
   variation was detected between marking treatments, however marked
   females laid significantly more eggs than control females. We assume
   that such higher reproductive outputs are responses to the stress
   induced by skin injury by both marking techniques, but this hypothesis
   remains to be tested. The field experiment consisted of monitoring a
   newt population in a pond where individuals (n = 121) were marked by,
   either marking technique. No difference in survival or in body condition
   was detected between marking treatments. Either technique reliably met
   the requirements of data processing. The present study, shows that data
   obtained with both techniques can be regarded as similarly suitable for
   estimating population parameters. However, because of better long-term
   reading reliability, PIT-tagging appears to be the preferred one,
   provided that body size is sufficiently, large to accomodate a

Title = {{Numerical fluctuations in the northern short-tailed shrew: evidence of
   non-linear feedback signatures on population dynamics and demography}},

Abstract = {{1. We studied a fluctuating population of the northern short-tailed
   shrew (Blarina brevicauda) in the Appalachian Plateau Province of
   Pennsylvania, USA, spanning 21 years of monitoring. We analysed the
   pattern of annual temporal variation fitting both time-series models and
   capture-mark-recapture (CMR) statistical models for survival and
   recruitment rates.
   2. We determined that non-linear first-order models explain almost 80\%
   of the variation in annual per capita population growth rates. In
   particular, a non-linear self-excited threshold autoregressive (SETAR)
   model describes the time-series data well. Average snowfall showed
   positive and non-linear effects on population dynamics.
   3. The CMR statistical models showed that a non-linear threshold model
   with strong effects of population density was the best one to describe
   temporal variation in survival rates. On the other hand, population
   density or climatic variables did not explain temporal variation in
   recruitment rates. Survival rates were high during the study period.
   Weekly changes in population size attributable to new recruits entering
   in the population fluctuate between 21\% and 0\%, while the changes in
   population size related to survival fluctuate between 79\% and 100\%.
   4. Two important results arise from this study. First, non-linear models
   with first-order feedback appear to capture the essential features of
   northern short-tailed shrew dynamics and demography. Secondly, climate
   effects represented by snowfall appear to be small and non-linear on
   this insectivore. The population dynamics of this shrew in the
   Appalachian Plateau are determined apparently by a strong non-linear
   first-order feedback process, which is related to survival rates.
   5. This study links population dynamics and demography by detecting the
   underlying demographic mechanisms driving population dynamics. The
   feedback structure of this shrew suggests the existence of population
   dynamics dominated by intraspecific competitive interactions, such as
   aggression, solitary nesting, non-overlapping home ranges and
   territoriality.}},

Abstract = {{During 1995-1997, we monitored Carolina chickadee Poecile carolinensis
   nests in a fragmented forest landscape in northcentral Ohio, USA. Nest
   success was positively correlated with woodlot area and most nest loss
   was due to nest destruction by house wrens Troglodytes aedon. During
   1998 and 1999, we conducted an experiment in both large (> 6.8 ha) and
   small (< 6.8 ha) woodlots in which we gave chickadees a choice of
   nesting on edges of woodlots (preferred wren habitat) or in the center
   of woodlots. We found no difference in nest success between large and
   small woodlots, but regardless of woodlot size, nest success was lower
   on edges than in the center. In the experiment, 100\% of nest loss was
   due to nest destruction by house wrens. Given a choice, Carolina
   chickadees preferred to nest centrally more often than on edges. These
   results suggest that in fragmented landscapes where house wrens are
   common, nest destruction by house wrens is a major cause of nest failure
   in the Carolina chickadee. Such edge-dependent interspecific nest-site
   usurpation has not been previously recognized as a potentially important
   selective factor in nest site selection.}},

Abstract = {{Aim In fragmented landscapes, the survival of plant populations may
   depend on sufficient rates of migration between fragments with which to
   counteract local extinctions. Empirical information on the plant
   migration process is limited because of the difficulties of directly
   measuring the rare medium to long-distance dispersal events involved.
   The potential for hardwood tree species' seedlings growing in conifer
   plantations to offer `a posteriori' measures of intermediate to
   long-distance dispersal events was evaluated.
   Location Fragmented eastern deciduous forest in a rural, agricultural
   landscape, Southern Ontario.
   Methods To indicate the degree to which plantations `sample' incoming
   seed, seedling populations were enumerated in plantations and their
   species composition and abundances compared with those of mature trees,
   the presumed seed sources, in the surrounding landscape (to 150 m
   distance). To further quantify the degree to which hardwood seedling
   populations in plantations represent seed input, seeds of twelve
   hardwood species were sown in pine plantations and their emergence and
   early seedling survival monitored for 2 years. A subset of four of these
   species was planted in hardwood woodlots and their survival compared
   with survival in plantations to indicate how well seedlings in
   plantations reflect colonization in deciduous forest fragments.
   Results Hardwood seedling populations in plantations comprised the
   majority of tree species present in the surrounding landscape. Species'
   seedling abundances were significantly related to tree abundances around
   plantations. These findings indicate that most hardwood species can
   establish in plantations and do so in approximate proportion to the
   amount of seed supplied. All species produced first year seedlings in
   plantations, but rates of seedling survival were variable, ranging from
   under 5 to over 40\% per species. Large-seeded species had significantly
   greater seedling survival than smaller-seeded species, suggesting that
   seed size-survivorship relationships could be used to adjust seedling
   frequencies to measure seed rain. Mean light levels photosynthetically
   active radiation (PAR) were significantly higher in plantations than in
   hardwood woodlots, yet rates of early seedling establishment were
   comparable between plantations and woodlots for four experimentally sown
   species.
   Main conclusions Hardwood seedlings in plantations appear to provide
   reasonable, although conservative, measures of dispersal to forest
   fragments, albeit with certain qualifications including adjustments for
   species' establishment abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling diffuse phosphorus (P) loss may indicate management strategies
   to minimize P loss from agricultural sources. An empirical model
   predicting flow-weighted phosphorus concentrations (MRP) was derived
   using data collected from 35 Irish river catchments. Monitoring records
   of riverine P and stream now data were used to calculate MRP values
   averaged for the years 1991-1994. These data were modeled using land
   use, soil type, and soil P data. Soil type in catchments was described
   using soil survey classifications weighted according to their P
   desorption properties from laboratory results. Soil test P
   concentrations for the studied watersheds were obtained from a national
   database. Soil P levels ere weighted based on the results of field
   experiments measuring P losses in overland flow from fields at different
   soil test P levels. The 35 catchments were statistically clustered into
   two populations (A and B) based on differences in soil type,
   specifically, soil hydrology. Catchments in Cluster A had predominantly
   poorly drained soils and comparatively higher MRP concentrations
   (0.03-0.17 mg L-1) than Cluster B areas (0.01-0.7 mg L-1) with mostly
   well-drained soils. Regression equations derived for A and B type
   catchments predicted MRP values with 68 and 62\% of the variation
   explained in the models, respectively. Data extracted for the rest of
   the country were applied to the models to delineate areas at risk on a
   national scale. While the models were only, moderately accurate they
   highlighted the influence of land management, specifically, high
   production grassland receiving high P inputs, in conjunction with the
   effect of soil type and soil hydrology on the transport of P to surface
   waters.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating personal exposures to air pollution is a crucial component in
   identifying high-risk populations and determining efficient control
   strategies. Because of the difficulty of comprehensively measuring
   personal exposure, data on air pollution patterns in homogenous
   microenvironments linked with activity data are often used as
   surrogates. In this study, we focus on strengthening the available
   information about nonresidential microenvironmental exposures to
   particulate matter and other combustion pollutants. During the summer of
   2000, we measured ultrafine particles, fine particulate matter (PM2.5),
   and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) outdoors and
   in indoor micro environments in Boston, Massachusetts. In indoor
   microenvironments averaged across sample days, mean ultrafine particle
   concentrations ranged from 3800 to 140,000 particles/cm(3), with 7-200
   mug/m(3) Of PM2.5 and 5-12 ng/m(3) of particle-bound PAH. PM2.5
   indoor-outdoor ratios generally exceeded I in settings with high levels
   of human activity, with lower ratios for ultrafine particles. Cooking
   activities contributed significantly to elevated levels of all three
   pollutants. Using Linear Mixed Effects models with AR-1 autoregressive
   correlation structures, 10-min average outdoor concentrations were
   generally weak predictors of indoor levels, with stronger relationships
   in ail apartment without mechanical ventilation than in air-conditioned
   nonresidential settings. Although further study would be needed to
   determine whether these patterns could be generalized beyond the
   monitored sites, these data support previous findings and enhance our
   knowledge about nonresidential exposure patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor and outdoor air pollution monitoring may indicate potential human
   exposure to air contaminants. Individual and population exposures to air
   contaminants depend upon many factors including time spent outdoors and
   indoors, permeability of housing structures, and mobility within a
   community. In this report, we illustrate an approach for using long-term
   air monitoring to establish patterns or changes of environmental
   exposures, improve validity and representativeness of data, and prevent
   exposure misclassification. Long-term air monitoring for hydrogen
   sulfide (11,S) at 14 Dakota City, Nebraska, residences identified
   differences in area-wide concentration levels, geographic locations, and
   seasonal exposures. Air data for 1999 indicated that Dakota City
   residents were repeatedly exposed, both indoors and outdoors, to
   moderate levels( greater than or equal to90 parts per billion {[}ppb])of
   H2S. Using GIS modeling and kriging,we produced a geographic gradient of
   exposure estimate or map forambient H2S. These findings formed the basis
   for designing two health investigations for this community.}},

Abstract = {{During March-June 2000 we evaluated the use of call-response surveys to
   monitor breeding Yuma Clapper Rails (Rallus longirostris yumanensis) at
   the Cienega de Santa Clara, Colorado River Delta, Sonora, Mexico. We
   assessed the effect that time of day, stage of breeding season, and
   number of survey periods had on the average number of rails detected at
   a station. Conducting call-response surveys resulted in a significant
   increase in the number of detected rails and reduced the coefficient of
   variation of the average number or rails per station, which increases
   the statistical power to detect population trends. Using this technique
   also appears to reduce the variation of rates of responses by rails
   through the breeding season when compared to passive listening. There
   was no difference between the number of rails detected during morning
   and afternoon surveys. The established protocol developed by the U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service for Yuma Clapper Rail surveys is adequate for
   monitoring, and it should continue to be implemented on a yearly basis
   at the Cienega de Santa Clara and other wetlands of the Colorado River

Abstract = {{This communication reports incidental observations on Toxascaris leonina
   infections in a beagle breeding colony. Regular faecal monitoring
   demonstrated that T. leonina was endemic in the adult dam population
   within this colony. Small numbers of 7 leonina eggs were also detected
   in the faeces of weaned pups from eight weeks of age possibly produced
   by a patent infection. This would mean a pre-patent period for 7 leonina
   of 56 days or less. Worm counts on 10 pups showed that 60\% of pups had
   acquired a T. leonina infection by 12 weeks of age. Since prenatal and
   lactogenic transmission do not occur and as the pups were kept in an
   environment which reduced chances of infection with T. leonina and there
   was no apparent source of paratenic hosts, the source of infection must
   have been embryonated T leonina eggs from the whelping environment.
   These observations on T. leonina demonstrate that, if pups are exposed
   to an infected environment, patent infections may be seen in a younger
   age group than is normally associated with T. leonina infections.}},

Abstract = {{At semiarid Charters Towers, north Queensland, Australia, the importance
   of Aedes aegypti (L.) in wells was assessed in relation to the
   colonization of surface habitats during the wet season. From April to
   July 1999, 10 wells (five positive for Ae. aegypti) were monitored to
   assess their status and larvae population numbers therein. All surface
   containers located within a 100 m radius of each well were removed,
   treated with s-methoprene or sealed to prevent the utilization of these
   containers by mosquitoes. These inner cores were surrounded by outer
   zones for a further 100 m in which surface containers were left
   untreated but all subterranean habitats were treated. Ovitraps were
   monitored monthly in the inner cores for 36 wk from August 1999 to April
   2000 and differences in the proportions of ovitraps positive for Ae.
   aegypti and Ochlerotatus notoscriptus (Skuse) were analyzed by logistic
   regression. Analysis of the proportions of ovitraps positive for Ae.
   aegypti near positive wells indicated significantly greater colonization
   from November to March (the wet season), compared with those situated
   near Ae. aegypti negative wells. As Oc. notoscriptus were not produced
   from subterranean sites, comparisons of the proportions of ovitraps
   positive for Oc. notoscriptus in positive and negative inner cores
   provided an indication of the relative productivity of the uncontrolled
   surface containers in the outer zones. Differences in the utililization
   of ovitraps by Oc. notoscriptus among positive and negative cores were
   observed during only one month (March), when oviposition was greater in
   ovitraps in the negative cores, compared with the positive cores. Best
   subsets linear regression analysis of the proportion of ovitraps
   positive for Ae. aegypti against meteorological variables (rainfall,
   mean wind speed, mean relative humidity, mean minimum, and maximum
   temperature) during the week of ovitrapping indicated that minimum
   temperature and wind speed accounted for 63.4\% of the variability. This
   study confirms that for semiarid towns such as Charters Towers, the
   practice of treating a relatively small number of key subterranean
   habitats during winter will significantly affect Ae. aegypti
   recolonization of surface container habitats during summer, the period
   of greatest risk for dengue.}},

Abstract = {{We reviewed the literature to assess status and population trends and to
   identify mortality factors affecting Golden Eagle populations in the
   U.S. and Canada. Nesting populations in Alaska and Canada are stable,
   but some nesting populations in the western U.S. have declined. Small
   but steady declines in the intermountain West have been associated with
   shrub loss and declining jack, rabbit populations; declines in southern
   California have been attributed to urbanization. Migration counts in the
   eastern U.S. suggest a decline in Golden Eagles from the 1930s to the
   early 1970s, with a stable or increasing trend since the early 1970s. No
   significant trends in migration counts were reported for Golden Eagles
   in the western U.S. since the mid-1980s. Western migration count sites
   on the continental divide in the Rock Mountains at or just north of the
   U.S.-Canadian border (49-51 degreesN latitude) show potential to provide
   information on trends of Golden Eagle populations from Alaska and
   western Canada. Most eagle mortality is human related. This paper
   illustrates the need for more effective monitoring of Golden Eagle
   populations in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Annual territory occupancy and reproductive success of nesting Golden
   Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were monitored at 58-76 nesting areas in
   Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska since 1988. Data were
   collected annually using two standardized aerial surveys and follow-up
   foot surveys. Aerial surveys were conducted during the early incubation
   period (late April) to determine occupancy and nesting activities and
   late in the nestling period (late July) to Count fledglings and
   determine nesting success. All aerial surveys were conducted rising a
   Bell 206B Jet Ranger helicopter with one or two experienced observers
   and an experienced wildlife pilot. Aerial surveys were the most time-
   and cost-efficient means to survey the 1800-km(2) studs area. Average
   flight time during late April surveys was 12.8 flight hr (over 3 d) and
   during late July was 5.3 flight hr on 1 d. Duration of surveys depended
   on nesting activities. Foot surveys were useful for making longer
   observations in areas where territory occupancy could not be determined
   during aerial surveys. Annual occupancy rates averaged 83\%. Laying
   rates, success rates, and overall population productivity varied
   significantly over the study period. Fledgling production varied greatly
   over the 12-yr period front a low of 9 fledglings in 1994 to a high of
   70 fledglings in 1999. Laying rates, mean brood size, and overall
   population productivity were significantly correlated with abundance of
   cyclic snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and Willow ptarmigan (Lagopus
   lagopus) populations. Cyclic prey did not influence occupancy rates,
   Most territories were occupied more than 8 yr, but four remained vacant
   throughout the study. Productivity varied greatly among nesting
   territories. More than 50\% of all fledglings were produced at 17
   nesting areas and >75\% of all fledglings were produced at 35 nesting
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates how PM2.5 varies spatially and how these spatial
   characteristics can be used to identify potential monitoring sites that
   are most representative of the overall ambient exposures to PM2.5 among
   susceptible populations in the Seattle, WA, area. Data collected at
   outdoor sites at the homes of participants of a large exposure
   assessment study were used in this study. Harvard impactors (HIs) were
   used at 40 outdoor sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area. Up to
   six sites at a time were monitored for 10 consecutive 24-hr average
   periods. A fixed-effect analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included
   date and location effects was used to analyze the spatial variability of
   outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. Both date and location effects were shown
   to be highly significant, explaining 92\% of the variability in outdoor
   PM2.5 measurements. The day-to-day variability was 10 times higher than
   the spatial variability between sites. The site mean square was more
   than twice the error mean square, showing that differences between
   sites, while modest, are potentially an important contribution to
   measurement error.
   Variances of the model residuals and site effects were examined against
   spatial characteristics of the monitoring sites. The spatial
   characteristics included elevation, distance from arterials, and
   distance from major PM2.5 point sources. Results showed that the most
   representative PM2.5 sites were located at elevations of 80-120 m above
   sea level, and at distances of 100-300 m from the nearest arterial road.
   Location relative to industrial PM2.5 sources is not a significant
   predictor of residential outdoor PM2.5 measurements. Additionally, for
   sites to be representative of the average population exposures to PM2.5,
   among those highly susceptible to the health effects of PM2.5, areas of
   high elderly population density were considered. These representative
   spatial characteristics were used as multiple, overlapping criteria in a
   Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to determine where the most
   representative sites are located.}},

Abstract = {{Three mosquito-borne human encephalitis viruses (eastern equine
   encephalitis virus {[}EEE], St. Louis encephalitis virus {[}SLE], and La
   Crosse encephalitis virus {[}LAC]) are sympatric in the southeastern
   United States. However, little is known concerning the temporal and
   spatial pattern of the distribution of these viruses in this area. As
   part of surveillance activities to detect the transmission of these 3
   viruses in the Tennessee Valley area, we developed a single-tube
   multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay
   capable of detecting these 3 mosquito-borne viruses in a single
   reaction. Three viruses were differentiated by size of amplified
   products. Sensitivities of the multiplex RT-PCR assay for SLE, EEE, and
   LAC were 1-3 log median tissue culture infective doses per pool, roughly
   comparable to the reported sensitivity of PCR detection assays for the
   individual viruses, and 1 log more sensitive than antigen-capture assays
   for SLE and EEE. The sensitivity of the multiplex PCR was not changed
   significantly when carried out in the presence of extract: prepared from
   50 uninfected mosquitoes. The cost of the assay is estimated at \$2.98
   per test, similar to the cost of other RT-PCR-based assays for viruses.
   However, adaptation of the RT-PCR to a multiplex format adds less than
   \$0.01 to the per-unit cost of an RT-PCR assay targeting a single virus
   species. Analysis of these data suggests that the single-tube multiplex
   RT-PCR assay represents a sensitive, specific, cost-effective, and rapid
   method for monitoring activities of the 3 endemic mosquito-borne human
   encephalitis viruses in mosquito populations in the southeastern United
   States.}},

Abstract = {{Incubation period., hatching success, and emergence percentage in
   loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nests were quantified during the 1993 and
   1995 nesting seasons and following incubation seasons in Minabe,
   Wakayama, Japan. Sand and nest temperatures were also monitored. Over
   the seasons, daily mean sand temperature at nest depth fluctuated
   between 18.0degreesC and 33.3degreesC, with a steep increase in the
   second week of July and a peak in late August. Temperatures inside the
   nest chambers were a few degrees above those of the surrounding sand at
   the end of incubation. The incubation period ranged from 46 to 82 days.
   A significant negative correlation was found between mean sand
   temperature and incubation period. The relationship conformed to the
   day-degree concept. There was no significant seasonal trend in hatching
   success, but many pre-emergent hatchlings were found dead in most of the
   clutches during the warmest part of the season. Emergence percentage was
   correlated with mean sand temperature calculated for 4 days before
   emergence, suggesting that mortality may be due to heat. This
   heat-related mortality is considered to be a common phenomenon at our
   study site, because the peak in emergences coincides with the peak in
   high temperatures. These temperature effects on hatchling mortality must
   be taken into account in estimates of hatchling sex ratios. Because sand
   temperatures already exceed the optimal thermal range for incubation,
   this population is vulnerable to even small temperature increases
   resulting from global warming.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria vector Anopheles and other mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were
   monitored for 12 months during 1994-95 in villages of Lower Moshi
   irrigation area (37degrees20' E. 3degrees21' S; similar to700 m a.s.l.)
   south of Mount Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania. Adult mosquito
   populations were sampled fortnightly by five methods: human bait
   collection indoors (18.00-06.00 hours) and outdoors (18.00-24.00 hours),
   from daytime resting-sites indoors and outdoors; by CDC light-traps over
   sleepers. Anopheles densities and rates of survival, anthropophily and
   malaria infection were compared between three villages representing
   different agro-ecosystems: irrigated sugarcane plantation, smallholder
   rice irrigation scheme. and savannah with subsistence crops. Respective
   study villages were Mvuleni (population 2200). Chekereni (population
   3200) and Kisangasangeni (population similar or equal to1000), at least
   7 km apart.
   Anopheles arabiensis Patton was found to be the principal malaria vector
   throughout the study area, with An. funestus Giles sensu lato of
   secondary importance in the sugarcane and savannah villages. Irrigated
   sugarcane cultivation resulted in water pooling, but this did not
   produce more vectors. Anopheles arabiensis densities averaged four-fold
   higher in the ricefield village, although their human blood-index was
   significantly less (48\%) than in the sugarcane (68\%) or savannah
   (66\%) villages, despite similar proportions of humans and cows (ratio 1
   :1.1-1.4) as the main hosts at all sites. Parous rates, duration of the
   gonotrophic cycle and survival rates of An. arabiensis were similar in
   villages of all three agro-ecosystems.
   The potential risk of malaria, based on measurements of vectorial
   capacity of An. arabiensis and An. funestus combined, was four-fold
   higher in the ricefield village than in the sugarcane or savannah
   villages nearby. However, the more realistic estimate of malaria risk.
   based on entomological inoculation rates, indicated that exposure to
   infective vectors was 61-68\% less for people in the ricefield village,
   due to the much lower sporozoite rate in An. arabiensis (ricefield
   0.01\%, sugarcane 0.1\%, savannah 0.12\%). This contrast was attributed
   to better socio-economic conditions of rice farmers, facilitating
   relatively more use of antimalarials and bednets for their families. Our
   findings show that, for a combination of reasons, the malaria challenge
   is lower for villagers associated with an irrigated rice-growing scheme
   (despite greater malaria vector potential), than for adjacent
   communities with other agro-ecosystems bringing less socio-economic
   benefits to health. This encourages the development of agro-irrigation
   schemes in African savannahs, provided that residents have ready access
   to antimalaria materials (i.e. effective antimalaria drugs and
   insecticidal bednets) that they may better afford for protection against
   the greater vectorial capacity of An. arabiensis from the ricefield
   agro-ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The activities of two enzymes involved in metabolic energy production,
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate synthase (CS), were determined
   in the white trunk musculature of snapper, Pagrus auratus (Bloch \&
   Schneider 1801), to determine whether the metabolic capacity reflects
   seasonal variations. LDH and CS activities for a population of wild fish
   were monitored on a monthly basis over a period of 1 year and correlated
   with body length and seasonal variation. Significant correlations were
   observed between enzyme activity and body length. Increased LDH activity
   may reflect energy demand for anaerobic burst swimming. In contrast,
   declining CS activity with increasing body length may indicate a
   reduction in energy generation. The seasonal variation of CS activity
   coincided with the somatic growth cycle, increasing from 1.18 U g(-1)
   white muscle in winter to 1.79 in spring and 1.78 in late summer,
   whereas LDH activity did not show a clear seasonal pattern. This
   information could be useful for tracking metabolic capacity in field
   specimens using simple biochemical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Ability to distinguish the gender of individuals of any animal
   population is a useful field tool. Blue penguins (Eudyptula minor)
   exhibit a sexual dimorphism in bill size which has not been confirmed
   for any New Zealand population solely by internal anatomy. In this
   study, bill and head dimensions were taken from birds sexed by
   dissection. Measurements taken from a reference group of morphologically
   adult birds were used to construct equations by discriminant analysis.
   Those equations were applied to the bill measurements of a separate,
   opportunistically collected test sample, including juveniles, the gender
   of which was known from necropsy. We found a 15\% inaccuracy in the test
   group, mostly derived from errors in identifying juvenile males. Removal
   of those individuals reduced the error to 10\%. Application of the
   equation to 47 pairs of living birds of a monitored breeding population
   determined the gender wrongly for only two of 94 birds. Except for
   juvenile males, this method is useful for identifying gender in
   unselected populations of blue penguins in the field. The principle is
   readily applicable to other New Zealand populations.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of Venturia inaequalis to trifloxystrobin was monitored
   by both in vitro (spore germination) and in vivo tests (on apple
   seedlings). There was good correlation between the in vitro and in vivo
   results. Baseline sensitivity was established with 95 bulk isolates from
   Europe between 1995 and 1998 which showed a narrow sensitivity
   range-factor of up to 17 between the least and most sensitive isolates.
   Monitoring of populations originating from trifloxystrobin-treated and
   untreated orchards between 1995 and 1999 showed only sensitive isolates
   and no performance deficiencies were reported. Data also show that
   trifloxystrobin is not cross-resistant to anilinopyrimidines and
   triazoles, but is cross-resistant to kresoxim-methyl, another
   strobilurin which also inhibits the cytochrome bc1 enzyme complex at the
   Qo-site in the respiration chain of fungal mitochondria (QoI
   inhibitors). Under experimental conditions from a specific trial site in
   Switzerland, where trifloxystrobin has been tested since 1994, isolates
   containing conidia resistant to Qo inhibitors were detected in 1997 and
   1999. However no obvious performance deficiencies were reported.
   Nevertheless these results demonstrate a risk for the development of
   practical resistance in V inaequalis to Qo inhibitors and therefore a
   need to apply resistance management principles strictly. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Gaura neomexicana subsp. coloradensis Munz (Onagraceae), (Colorado
   butterfly plant), a short-lived perennial forb, became listed as a
   threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October 2000
   because of its small global range and population size. This endemic
   subspecies consists of only 18 extant populations within southeastern
   Wyoming, southwestern Nebraska, and northeastern Colorado. Wyoming
   occurrences are on private land with the exception of three occurrences
   on F. E. Warren Air Force Base, near Cheyenne. Gaura neomexicana subsp.
   coloradensis may be displaced by many competitors, including Cirsium
   arvense (L.) Scop. (Canada thistle), an invasive, noxious weed. In June
   1998, three G. neomexicana subsp. coloradensis populations were examined
   for rosette establishment in the presence of and after removal of
   associated species. The four study treatments removed: (1) Cirsium
   arvense, (2) grass and forb canopy and associated litter, (3) grass and
   forb canopy, litter, and C. arvense, and (4) no removal of associated
   plant species (control). Mature G. neomexicana subsp. coloradensis
   plants were evaluated for height, number of leaves, and capsule
   production. The mature plant characteristics monitored in 1998 were not
   good indicators of subsequent G. neomexicana subsp. coloradcnsis rosette
   densities in the following spring. Recruitment was assessed by counting
   new rosettes in the fall 1999. Although both G. neomexicana subsp.
   coloradensis and the exotic C. arvense have comparable habitat, removal
   of C. arvense did not increase G. neomexicana subsp. coloradensis
   vegetative growth, seed capsule production, or rosette density. Removal
   of other forbs, grass, and litter, however, increased G. neomexicana
   subsp. coloradensis rosette density in the following two years,
   indicating that canopy removal of associated species can enhance rosette
   establishment of this rare native. The accumulation of dense vegetative
   cover and litter associated with the absence of herbivory and fire may
   contribute to the decline of rare species in rich riparian habitats.
   Return of herbivory and fire in mesic sites to reduce standing biomass
   accumulations should be considered in restoring recruitment potential to
   rare monocarpic species.}},

Abstract = {{Inappropriate land use practices, pollutants, exploitation, and
   overpopulation have simplified stream habitats and degraded water
   quality worldwide. Management agencies are now being tasked to
   ameliorate impacts and restore stream ``health,{''} yet there is a
   dearth of rigorous scientific methods and theory on which to base sound
   restoration design and monitoring. Despite this, many localized
   restoration projects are being constructed to stabilize erosion and
   enhance habitat heterogeneity in streams. Many restoration attempts
   adopt the paradigm that increasing habitat heterogeneity will lead to
   restoration of biotic diversity, yet there have been few studies that
   have manipulated variation of a physical parameter independent of the
   mean to isolate the effects of heterogeneity per se. We conducted a
   field experiment to mimic restoration of habitat heterogeneity in a
   shallow. stony stream. By using an experimental approach rather than a
   detailed assessment of existing restoration work, we were able to
   control the starting conditions of replicate riffles so that organism
   responses could be unambiguously attributed to the heterogeneity
   treatments. We successfully manipulated the variability of streambed
   particle sizes and consequently near-bed flow characteristics of entire
   riffles. These factors define axes of habitat heterogeneity at scales
   relevant to the resident macro invertebrate fauna. Despite this, we were
   unable to distinguish differences in community structure between high
   and low habitat heterogeneity treatments. Power analysis indicated that
   macroinvertebrate populations were more sensitive to individual site
   conditions at each riffle than to the heterogeneity treatments,
   suggesting that increasing habitat heterogeneity may be an ineffective
   technique if the restoration goals are to promote macroinvertebrate
   recovery in denuded streams. With extremely high variability between
   replicate riffles, monitoring programs for localized restoration
   projects or point source impacts are unlikely to detect gradual shifts
   in community structure until the differences between the reference and
   treatment sites are extreme. Innovative measurement of other parameters,
   such as ecosystem function variables (e.g., production, respiration,
   decomposition), may be more appropriate indicators of change at local
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the feasibility of using multivariate statistics to
   model fish species distribution and habitat requirements for
   intermittent streams in semi-arid regions, many of which are coming
   under increasing pressure from water resource development schemes. The
   assessment was based on the geographical distribution of six endemic
   fish species in the Guadiana river, a semi-arid river system in southern
   Iberia. Their presence was related to 20 environmental variables linked
   to climate, geomorphology, riparian vegetation and location in the
   drainage basin. These variables were collected in the field or from
   topographical maps, to evaluate habitat suitability and to predict the
   presence of the species according to season. Multivariate logistic
   regression in a geographic information system (GIS) environment was
   performed to identify regions with high probability of occurrence for
   each species. The variables that best explained the occurrence of the
   species were the sample location in the drainage basin, the
   geomorphology and the riparian vegetation. The models presented have a
   high predictive power and can be used in monitoring and predicting
   temporal changes caused by human activities. This modelling approach can
   be used to predict the areas that need to be conserved to protect or
   rehabilitate the endangered species. Armed with this information,
   managers can formulate conservation measures to prevent further
   degradation of the stocks and possibly enhance the populations.

Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},

Pages = {{21-30}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Bark products constitute nearly one third of plant material used in
   South African traditional medicine. Since the large majority of South
   Africans make use of traditional health care, bark is fundamental to the
   traditional pharmacopoeia. In this review we consider the status of bark
   resources, as reflected by the literature, and highlight the need for
   multi-disciplinary research to address the lack of available information
   on plant species used for their bark. The supply of bark to the
   medicinal plant trade has been rendered non-sustainable, due to
   increased user populations and reduced indigenous vegetation. Whilst
   conservation of the South African flora is paramount, natural resources
   cannot meet the current, nor foreseeable, demand for bark. Alternatives
   such as tree propagation and cultivation, strategic management and plant
   part substitution are discussed. Effective implementation of these
   action plans is reliant on the dissemination of existing and new
   knowledge. The prevailing scenario of a non-sustainable bark supply has
   impacted negatively on the quality of bark products available to the
   consumer, as problems of incorrect identification and purposeful
   adulteration arise. To facilitate monitoring and standardisation,
   phytochemical references should be established for bark authentication,
   and used in conjunction with morphological and anatomical characters for
   identification in the case of unknown specimens. The importance of bark
   in South African traditional health care warrants attention from all
   research sectors to conserve the country's rich floral heritage, and the
   integrity of traditional health care.}},

Abstract = {{Killdeer (Charadirus vociferus) is a common and widespread North
   American species for which there are few studies of residency patterns
   and movements. We quantified fidelity and movement patterns of 24
   radio-tagged Killdeer in the Willamette Valley of Oregon during the
   winter of 1999-2000. Results from telemetry surveys and census efforts
   repealed that the group monitored was composed of winter residents
   (63\%), winter transient, (26\%), and year-round residents (11\%).
   Movements were localized with birds detected at an average distance of
   5.15 +/- 0.91 (SE) km front the site of capture. Mean home range size
   (95\% kernel) was 7.73 +/- 3.19 km(2). However. results also indicated
   periodic exploratory movements. with some birds detected Lip to 30 kin
   from marking Sites. Overall, individuals exhibited a low degree of
   fidelity to specific sites and were detected at an average of 11.9 +/-
   1.1 sites. No differences were found in monthly movement patterns. In
   almost all cases, year-round residents were more sedentary than winter
   residents and winter transients. Results indicate a complex regional
   population structure and highlight the need to consider both migrant and
   resident birds, as well as seasonal differences in habitat needs and
   space use requirements, in future conservation planning efforts.

Abstract = {{In 1990, the North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP)
   implemented a small-wetland restoration program in Prince Edward Island
   (PEI), Canada. Wetlands were restored by means of dredging accumulated
   sediment and organic debris to create open water and emulate
   pre-disturbance conditions. Three call surveys were conducted in the
   spring and summer of 1998 and 1999 to estimate abundance and occurrence
   of spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer). wood frogs (Rana sylvatica).
   northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). American toads (Bufo americanus),
   and green frogs (Rana clamitans) on restored and reference wetlands.
   Numbers of species calling and abundance indices of northern leopard
   frogs. green frogs, and spring peepers were significantly higher on
   restored versus reference wetlands. The number of species calling in
   restored wetlands was positively correlated with proximity to freshwater
   rivers;, in reference wetlands. the number was positively associated
   with forested perimeters and area of open water. Occurrence of calling
   green frogs in restored wetlands was positively correlated with percent
   cattail and. in reference wetlands, with proximity to other wetlands.
   Our results suggest that small wetland restoration projects may be a
   good conservation tool for anurans. We recommend further research on
   reproductive success and on local population trends in restored wetlands
   to determine if restoration is beneficial for anurans on PEI.}},

Abstract = {{Concern about recent amphibian declines has led to research on amphibian
   populations, but few statistically tested, standardized methods of
   counting amphibians exist. We tested whether counts of northern
   two-lined salamander larvae (Eurycea bislineata) sheltered in leaf
   litter bags-a relatively new, easily replicable survey technique-had a
   linear correlation to total number of larvae. Using experimental
   enclosures placed in streams, we compared number of salamanders found in
   artificial habitat (leaf litter bags) with total number of salamanders
   in each enclosure. Low numbers of the animals were found in leaf litter
   bags, and the relative amount of variation in the index (number of
   animals in leaf litter bags compared to total number of animals in
   stream enclosures) was high. The index of salamanders in leaf litter
   bags was not significantly related to total number of salamanders in
   enclosures for two-thirds of the replicates or with pooled replicates
   (P=0.066). Consequently, we cannot recommend using leaf litter bags to
   index populations of northern two-lined salamanders.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced black (Rattus rattus) and Polynesian (R. exulans) rats are
   damaging to native birds, insects, and plants in island ecosystems. We
   controlled rodent populations in a montane rainforest on the island of
   Hawaii to determine feasibility, cost, and effectiveness of ground-based
   rodent control in a rugged, remote rainforest habitat. Treatment was
   conducted 1996-99, from January to April each year, using rodenticide
   bait stations and snap-traps. We monitored rodent numbers in 48-ha
   treatment and reference areas before, during, and after control. As
   indexed by presence of rat sign in tracking tunnels or census blocks.,
   rodent control reduced rodent abundance 58-90\% each year I month after
   treatment began. There was an influx of rats into the treatment area, as
   shown by higher than expected numbers of rats snap-trapped on the
   treatment perimeter. Rodent numbers recovered to approximate
   pretreatment levels by the beginning of the following treatment year.
   Cost of equipment and supplies for rodent control for the first year was
   about 7,000 for a 1-km(2) grid. After the first year, cost decreased to
   about \$2,000 for 1 km(2) per year. Rodent control applied continuously
   for 4 months each year during the breeding season may be effective in
   protecting nesting forest birds, but will not provide protection to
   plants and invertebrates vulnerable to predation throughout the year,
   and it is not likely to protect avian food resources.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service adopted a protocol
   for the adaptive management of waterfowl hunting regulations (AHM) to
   help reduce uncertainty about the magnitude of sustainable harvests. To
   date, the AHM process has focused principally on the midcontinent
   population of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), whose dynamics are
   described by 4 alternative models. Collectively, these models express
   uncertainty (or disagreement ) about whether harvest is an additive or a
   compensatory form of mortality and whether the reproductive process is
   weakly or strongly density-depenclent. Each model is associated with a
   probability or ``weight,{''} which describes its relative ability to
   predict changes in population size. These Bayesian probabilities are
   updated annually using a comparison of population size predicted under
   each model with that observed by a monitoring program. The current AHM
   process is passively adaptive in the sense that there is no a priori
   consideration of how harvest decisions might affect discrimination among
   models. We contrast this approach with an actively adaptive approach, in
   which harvest decisions are used in part to produce the learning needed
   to increase long-term management performance. Our investigation suggests
   that the passive approach is expected to perform nearly as well as an
   optimal actively adaptive approach, particularly considering the nature
   of the model set, management objectives and constraints, and current
   regulatory alternatives. We offer some comments about the nature of the
   biological hypotheses being tested and describe some of the inherent
   limitations on learning in the AHM process.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the nesting biology of color-banded populations of the
   Louisiana Waterthrush (Seiurus motacilla) at up to 25 sites across
   Pennsylvania from 1996-2001. Opportunistic polygyny in this species was
   documented for the first time during our study. Four out of 283 paired
   males were polygynous; one male and female were involved in a polygynous
   trio during two successive years. Opportunistic polygyny may have
   occurred primarily as a result of female territory fidelity and a
   locally skewed sex ratio in two cases, but appeared to be actively
   pursued as a mating strategy in the case of the male who was bigamous
   during two successive years. His aggressive territorial behavior was
   consistent with that reported for polygynous birds having naturally and
   experimentally elevated plasma levels of testosterone. The rate of
   nestling provisioning by this male at a failed secondary nest was
   substantially lower compared to his successful primary nest and compared
   to mean provisioning rates for monogamous males. In addition to reduced
   male parental care, protraction of the renesting interval following nest
   failure was another possible component cost of polygyny observed for one
   of the mates of this male. In this instance, both costs were borne by
   the first mated female, who was relegated to secondary status after her
   initial nest was depredated.}},

Abstract = {{The genetics of marine populations is a subject that has made little
   progress compared with the effort spent on the terrestrial environment.
   This is so despite ``applied{''} aspects such as stock management,
   marine aquaculture, creation of reserves, conservation of the coastal
   zones, taxonomy, and protection of species. The crowded and dispersive
   marine environment, with its steep physical gradients, favours the
   existence of a planktonic larval stage for most species. The attendant
   high fecundity has important consequences for selection differentials
   and dispersal and therefore for the evolution of genetic structures.
   These features must be taken into account in order to understand the
   origin and maintenance of marine biodiversity and, in some cases, to
   manage it. In this article, after a definition of genetic diversity
   among other aspects of biodiversity, special features of the marine
   environment and processes governing genetic diversity are given together
   with the molecular tools required to study it. Then, an overview of the
   interesting scientific questions in marine biodiversity research is
   given concerning:Errorthe population structure as a function of
   dispersal systems and spatial constraints: gene flow and speciation in a
   dispersive environment, Errorthe phylogeography and historical
   biogeography of marine ecosystems; Errorthe functional and adaptive
   aspects of polymorphism: larval phase and genetic control of
   recruitment. Some uses of genetic diversity for assessment, conservation
   and protection purposes are also detailed. Organismal (specific)
   diversity does not enter the scope of the article. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The progress of light leaf spot (Pyrenopeziza brassicae) epidemics on
   winter oilseed rape was monitored in 1998/99 and 1999/2000 at
   Rothamsted, and weather factors and P. brassicae ascospore
   concentrations were recorded daily. The data sets, which consisted of
   numbers of `apparently healthy' leaves, leaves with P. brassicae
   sporulation and dead leaves, were analysed using a structured population
   model with four compartments to investigate the effects of presence of
   P. brassicae inoculum (ascospores and conidiospores) and weather factors
   on the progress of light leaf spot on winter oilseed rape leaves, The
   model consists of ordinary differential or delay-differential equations
   to describe the rates of change per unit time in numbers of healthy
   susceptible leaves, infected leaves with no sporulation, leaves with
   sporulation, dead leaves (the four compartments) and the length of the
   latent period (which is temperature-dependent). The model allows for
   production of new susceptible leaves and leaf birth rate is assumed to
   be linearly dependent on temperature. The model incorporates an
   infection criterion depending on temperature and leaf wetness duration
   (expressed as rain duration). Rates of transition between the four
   compartments are related to rates of infection of `susceptible leaves',
   sporulation of `infected leaves' to produce `sporulating leaves' and
   death of leaves from these three compartments, Parameter values were
   estimated by fitting the model to the data sets. The model fitted the
   disease progress data equally well in both seasons. The model fitting
   suggested that disease progress could be described only if both
   ascospore and conidiospore numbers were included. When either of the
   parameters representing the rates of infection by ascospores or
   conidiospores was eliminated, the model did not fit the data well. The
   sum of the model outputs for the first two leaf compartments was
   compared to the recorded numbers of,apparently healthy' leaves: the fit
   to the data was better in 1999/2000 than in 1998/99. An assumption that
   the leaf birth rate changed around the time stem extension began (GS
   2,0) improved the fit of the model. Seasonal variations in temperature
   had a large effect on the length of the latent period, which increased
   when mean daily temperatures were less than 5 degreesC. (C) 2002

   European (two farmed strains and three wild populations) and East Asian
   (Amur wild carp, Vietnamese wild carp and Japanese Koi carp) subspecies,
   Cyprinus carpio carpio and C c. haematopterus, respectively.
   Polymorphism was detected using eight and six restriction enzymes,
   respectively, and a total of seven composite haplotypes were identified.
   Both distance-based and maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference
   methods clustered the haplotypes into four distinct groups-the European
   (two haplotypes), Amur (two haplotypes), Vietnamese (two haplotypes) and
   Koi (one haplotype), and their distributions strictly follow the
   geographic origin of populations. The populations are clustered into two
   highly divergent groups (average net nucleotide divergence, 2.4\%), the
   European and the East Asian populations, suggesting an ancient
   separation. Six enzymes (HinfI, AluI, HpaII and TaqI at ND-3/4; Eco47I
   and BsuRI at ND-5/6) yielded diagnostic restriction sites for
   discriminating between the European and East Asian maternal lineages
   that can be applied to monitoring of genetic purity of the European
   fanned strains. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Victoria, the largest tropical lake in the world, suffers from
   severe eutrophication and the probable extinction of up to half of its
   500+ species of endemic cichlid fishes. The continuing degradation of
   Lake Victoria's ecological functions has serious long-term consequences
   for the ecosystem services it provides, and may threaten social welfare
   in the countries bordering its shores. Evaluation of recent ecological
   changes in the context of aquatic food-web alterations, catchment
   disturbance and natural ecosystem variability has been hampered by the
   scarcity of historical monitoring data. Here, we present high-resolution
   palaeolimnological data, which show that increases in phytoplankton
   production developed from the 1930s onwards, which parallels
   human-population growth and agricultural activity in the Lake Victoria
   drainage basin. Dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria since the late
   1980s coincided with a relative decline in diatom growth, which can be
   attributed to the seasonal depletion of dissolved silica resulting from
   50 years of enhanced diatom growth and burial. Eutrophication-induced
   loss of deep-water oxygen started in the early 1960s, and may have
   contributed to the 1980s collapse of indigenous fish stocks by
   eliminating suitable habitat for certain deep-water cichlids.
   Conservation of Lake Victoria as a functioning ecosystem is contingent
   upon large-scale implementation of improved land-use practices.}},

Abstract = {{In Brazil more than 90\% of the population are not connected to
   municipal wastewater treatment plants. As a consequence, surface waters
   receive continuously considerable amounts of untreated domestic sewage
   containing surfactants as a major constituent. Such polluted waters gave
   rise to special interest if they are used as a source for the production
   of drinking water. In this work, the river Rio Macacu (State Rio de
   Janeiro, Brazil) was monitored for the occurrence of the most widely
   used anionic surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) together
   with its main degradative product, sulfophenyl carboxylates (SPC). In
   order to pursue the fate of both compounds after emission into the
   river, samples were collected at several locations along the river bank,
   and analyzed applying liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry after
   enrichment by solid-phase extraction. The LAS concentrations ranged
   between 14 and 155 mug 1(-1) and the levels of their metabolic
   intermediates were found from 1.2 to 14 mug 1(-1). The self-purification
   capacity of the water was impressively demonstrated in the upper course
   of the river downstream of a town considered as one major discharge
   point, whereas in the lower course the relative constant concentrations
   of both analytes were detected which was explained with an overall
   increasing level of pollution. Furthermore, a series of drinking water
   samples from Niteroi and Sao Goncalo, supplied by the same waterworks
   treating surface waters from the Rio Macacu, were taken during two
   sampling periods and examined for the presence of the strongly polar SPC
   which is suspected of by-passing the purification processes. The levels
   detected in the drinking water ranged between 1.6 and 3.3 mug 1(-1). For
   the analyses of drinking and surface waters the peak pattern of a
   selected SPC homologue composed by several positional isomers served as
   an indicator to describe the progression of SPC degradation occurred in
   the river and could be used to distinguish drinking waters of different
   origins. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chloroform, bromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane, and bromoform
   comprise the trihalomethanes, a group of widespread and mildly
   lipophilic compounds that result from water chlorination and other
   sources. Many animal studies show the chronic toxicity and
   carcinogenicity of these compounds, and recent work has demonstrated the
   importance of both ingestion and inhalation exposure pathways. This
   study presents partition coefficients describing the equilibrium among
   biological compartments (air, water, blood, milk, urine) for the four
   THMs based on results of headspace-gas chromatographic analyses
   performed under equilibrium conditions and at 37degreesC. The calculated
   partition coefficients ranged from 2.92 to 4.14 for blood/water,
   1.54-2.85 for milk/blood, and 3.41-4.93 for blood/urine, with the lowest
   being chloroform and the highest being bromoform. Both human and cow
   milk were tested, with similar results. The available samples of human
   milk may not fully account for differences in lipid content and possibly
   other factors that affect estimates of partition coefficients.
   Simultaneous measurements of milk and blood in exposed individuals are
   suggested to confirm laboratory results. Partition coefficients are
   predicted using the octanol-air partition coefficient, also measured in
   this study, and the octanol-water partition coefficient. Results are
   similar to literature estimates for liquid/air partitioning of
   chloroform and chlorodibromomethane, but they differ from predictions
   based on hydrophobicity and lipid content. High correlations between the
   derived partitioned coefficients and the molecular structure (number of
   Br atoms.) and physical properties (molecular weight and boiling point)
   are found for these analogous chemicals. In humans, THMs are both stored

Abstract = {{Studies involving carbon monoxide (CO) exposure assessment are mainly
   based on measurements at outdoor fixed sites or in various indoor
   micro-environments. Few studies have been based on personal exposure
   measurements. In this paper, we report results on personal measurements
   of CO in five European cities and we investigate determinants which may
   influence this personal exposure.
   Within the multi-centre European EXPOLIS study, personal exposure to CO,
   measured every minute for 48 h, of 401 randomly selected study
   participants (mainly non-smokers) was monitored in Athens, Basle,
   Helsinki, Milan and Prague. Each participant also completed a
   time-microenvironment-activity diary and an extended questionnaire. In
   addition, for the same time period, ambient levels of CO from fixed site
   stations were collected.
   There are significant differences in both personal exposure and ambient
   levels within the five cities, ranging from high values in Milan and
   Athens to low in Helsinki, Ambient levels are a significant correlate
   and determinant of CO 48-h personal exposure in all cities. From the
   other determinants studied (time spent in street traffic, time of
   exposure to ETS and time of exposure to gas burning devices) none was
   consistently significant for all cities. Change of the ambient CO levels
   from the 25th to the 75th percentile of its distribution resulted in a
   1.5-2 fold increase of 48-h personal exposure. Short time personal
   exposure was also studied in order to assess the influence of specific
   sources. Exposure levels were significantly higher when participants
   were in street traffic and in indoor locations in the presence of
   smokers.
   Personal 48-h exposure of non-smokers to CO varies among urban
   populations depending primarily on the ambient levels. For a CO source
   to be a significant determinant of the personal 48-h CO exposure, it has
   to affect the levels of CO in the person's proximity for an adequate
   length of time. Activities of individuals affect shorter term personal
   exposure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The only known population of the endangered shrub Epacris stuartii Stapf
   was studied from 1994 to 2001 using demographic census techniques. The
   effects of substrate, a fire and a storm on the emergence and survival
   of seedlings and the survival of established plants of different sizes
   were examined using failure-time analyses and logit-linear models.
   Ninety-five per cent of seedling emergence was delayed until the second
   post-fire spring, an unusual response among species with persistent soil
   seed banks. Mortality of seedlings was extreme compared with
   larger-seeded species, but diminished significantly with age. Seedling
   mortality varied significantly between substrates: 40\% of seedlings
   persisted for more than 5 years in mineral soil, whereas less than 10\%
   lived more than a year on rock and intermediate substrates. However,
   seedling numbers and local densities were lower on soils than other
   substrates. Background mortality of established plants was lower on soil
   and intermediate substrates (0.5\% per year) than on rock (3\% per
   year). Small plants may be more susceptible than large plants on rock,
   but not on soil. Both the fire and the storm resulted in elevated
   mortality of established plants. The population exhibited a variable
   response to fire, with plants on rock and intermediate substrates
   behaving as obligate seeders, whereas plants in soil resprouted. This
   appears to be the first report of microhabitat variation in fire
   response at sympatric scales. The effects of the storm were apparently
   independent of substrate and plant size. The essentially independent
   disturbance regimes comprising recurring fires and storms are likely to
   have a profound effect on the long-term population dynamics of E.
   stuartii . Over the 7-year census period, recruitment has failed to
   compensate for mortality, resulting in a 30\% net decline in the
   population. The demographic census has proved to be crucial in the
   detection and diagnosis of this decline.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the flexibility of symbiotic associations in coral reefs.
   we investigated the specificity of the Aiptasia (cf.
   insignis)-Symbiodinium association in the laboratory by rendering the
   anemones aposymbiotic and inoculating them with different isolates of
   Symbiodinium. Infective algal symbionts were monitored over 3 months by
   re-isolation and identification using denaturing-gradient gel
   electrophoresis and sequence comparison of their amplified 18S rRNA
   hypervariable V1 + V2 gene region. Despite similarity in their external
   morphology, the algal isolates differed in their infectivity towards the
   host. Within days of single-isolate inoculation, aposymbiotic anemones
   formed associations with fresh or cultured isolates (clade B) from the
   anemones Aiptasia sp. or A. tagetes, respectively. They associated to a
   limited extent with cultured isolates (clade A) from the tridacnids
   Tridacna crocea or Hippopus hippopus, and not at all with a cultured
   isolate (clade C) from the stony coral Montipora verrucosa, nor with a
   free-living isolate (clade A) from subtidal sands. Aposymbiotic anemones
   inoculated with a mixture of all isolates had only the anemone taxon as
   their detectable symbionts. Re-inoculation of induced symbioses with a
   mixture of all isolates and incubation with wild anemones showed that
   the initial induced symbioses with the anemone taxon were stable.
   Anemones originally infected with tridacnid isolates either additionally
   acquired the anemone taxon or had the former outgrown by the latter.
   These results demonstrate the presence of a host-symbiont recognition
   mechanism, and possibly competition among potential algal symbionts in
   the Aiptasia-Symbiodinium association. Here we present a method that may
   be useful in monitoring the algal population dynamics in symbiotic
   corals in the field, along with an efficient method of rendering
   Aiptasia aposymbiotic for further laboratory investigation of
   Aiptasia-Symbiodinium symbioses.}},

Abstract = {{Predator-induced defences are activated by cues associated with
   predators and confer some degree of resistance to subsequent attacks.
   Laboratory studies of many taxa have revealed such induced defences, and
   these data often conform to large-scale surveys of defence levels in
   habitats with and without predators. However, there have been no studies
   that make the direct connection between these laboratory studies and
   field surveys. We conducted a large-scale field manipulation of
   predators to provide this connection. Previous laboratory experiments on
   dragonfly (Leucorrhinia dubia) larvae have demonstrated that the
   presence of fish predators induces the development of elongated
   abdominal spines that serve to reduce mortality risk. In this study we
   determine the effect of whole-lake predator manipulation on this induced
   morphological defence of L. dubia. We monitored the spine lengths of
   final-instar larvae in two experimental lakes for 7 consecutive years.
   Fish were present during the first 2 years and then removed for the
   remaining 5 years. Results demonstrate that the spine lengths of L.
   dubia larvae decreased significantly in both lakes after the removal of
   fish. In contrast, there was no corresponding change in the spine
   lengths of larvae in reference lakes, and we found little change in food
   supply for larvae. Our results suggest that the plastic response in
   spine length is strong and attributable to the presence of predators.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of brominated flame retardant (BFR) chemicals, and
   particularly polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), tetrabromobisphenol
   A (TBBPA) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), has become of increasing
   concern to scientists over the past decade. Environmental studies
   conducted primarily in Europe, Japan and North America indicate that
   these chemicals are ubiquitous in sediment and biota. The levels of
   PBDEs seem to be increasing, and several trends, including in humans,
   indicate that this increase may be rapid. The occurrence of high
   concentrations of certain PBDE isomers may be sufficient to elicit
   adverse effects in some wildlife. There is also concern that levels
   could cause adverse effects in sensitive human populations such as young
   children, indigenous peoples, and fish consumers. However, our knowledge
   about these chemicals, their sources, environmental behavior, and
   toxicity is limited, making risk assessment difficult. In this paper,
   the current state of knowledge is reviewed and areas for further
   research recommended to improve future monitoring and risk assessment
   efforts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal variations of pollution biomarkers have been studied in two
   populations of Corbicula fluminea (Muller) for 2 years. Clams were
   collected from the Sanguinet lake and the Dronne river (Southwest
   France), sites characterised by water of excellent and passable quality,
   respectively. Biological parameters studied were enzymatic activity
   (catalase, propionylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase,
   NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and NADH-cytochrome c reductase activities)
   and indicators of physiological (protein, carbohydrate, lipid and ash
   contents, fresh and dry tissue weights, condition factor) and
   reproductive (amount of oocytes present in gonads and clams incubating
   larvae in gills) status. Environmental parameters (e.g. water
   temperature, chlorophyll a concentration) were also monitored. Effects
   of site, sampling date and season (from spring to winter) were studied,
   as well as relationships between abiotic and biotic factors. Finally, an
   index of variability was calculated for each biomarker. Catalase,
   propionyleholinesterase, NADH-cytochrome c reductase and lipids
   experienced the most pronounced seasonal fluctuations, whereas
   glutathione S-transferase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and proteins
   Suffered less pronounced ones. For some parameters, results differed
   depending on the site. Most seasonal changes were related to the
   reproductive cycle and/or water temperature. Implications of such
   variations in the use of pollution biomarkers in environmental surveys
   are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the ability of 29 indices of productivity to predict and track
   actual productivity of a Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) population
   for 21 years and to detect year-to-year changes in that productivity. Of
   29 indices tested, only the productivity of nests initiated in May
   showed promise. This index reasonably predicted productivity, correctly
   tracked two out of three temporal trends in productivity, and detected a
   significant proportion of year-to-year changes in actual productivity.
   Although they were not useful for predicting annual productivity, other
   indices based on nest data tracked trends in productivity moderately
   well, and all, except percent nest success, detected a significant
   proportion of year-to-year changes in productivity. Productivity indices
   based on non-reproductive variables, such as abundance of males or
   females, return rates, and veteran:novice ratios, did not reflect
   productivity trends or changes. From these results, we recommend that
   only an intensive measure of actual productivity or a partial measure of
   it, such as May productivity, be used to make inferences about annual
   productivity of a population. Indices based on other nest data should be
   used only for tracking productivity trends. Non-reproductive indices are
   unreliable for making any inferences about productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of spatial and temporal patterns of the small mammal cycle in
   Fennoscandia have led to two main conclusions: a south-north
   geographical gradient in the strength of density dependence and period
   length, and a change in temporal dynamics with less clear periodicity
   and lower amplitude of fluctuations in recent years. Fourteen years
   (1985-1998) of small mammals trapping and Tengmalm's owls monitoring
   data provided clear evidence for 3-yr cycles of two vote species in
   inner Troms, north Norway, at the same latitude and only 80 km from
   Kilpisjarvi, north Finland, where 4-5-yr cycles have been the norm until
   the end of 1980s. The response of Tengmalm's owls to variation in small
   rodents abundance was not delayed, as was observed in central Finland.
   Common shrews appeared to have more stable dynamics. The features of the
   cycle, and a reassessment of the previously described patterns, show
   that the dynamics may be different over short distances. Furthermore,
   snow cover and habitat fragmentation should explicitly be taken into
   account in any understanding of the Fermoscandian gradient, and
   surrogate variables such as latitude should be avoided. We stress the
   need for a more extensive coverage of spatial and temporal patterns in
   cyclicity with respect to assumed ecological causes.}},

   confirmed their status of highly mobile specialist predators in
   responding strongly and without time lag to water vote population
   changes. Even though polecats are considered generalists, they exhibited
   also a strong response to water vole fluctuations. Their numbers tracked
   water vole densities with a 1-yr time lag. Marked population changes
   were also recorded in red foxes and stone martens, but these changes
   were not related to water vole densities. Lastly, badgers did not show
   any significant population changes during the water vote cycle. We
   discuss the possible reasons for these differences and conclude that
   multi-factorial approach is clearly required to understand population
   processes in predator-prey systems.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of species richness of local communities has become an
   important topic in community ecology and monitoring. Investigators can
   seldom enumerate all the species present in the area of interest during
   sampling sessions. If the location of interest is sampled repeatedly
   within a short time period, the number of new species recorded is
   typically largest in the initial sample and decreases as sampling
   proceeds, but new species may be detected if sampling sessions are
   added. The question is how to estimate the total number of species. The
   data collected by sampling the area of interest repeatedly can be used
   to build species accumulation curves: the cumulative number of species
   recorded as a function of the number of sampling sessions (which we
   refer to as ``species accumulation data{''}). A classic approach used to
   compute total species richness is to fit curves to the data on species
   accumulation with sampling effort. This approach does not rest on direct
   estimation of the probability of detecting species during sampling
   sessions and has no underlying basis regarding the sampling process that
   gave rise to the data. Here we recommend a probabilistic, nonparametric
   estimator for species richness for use with species accumulation data.
   We use estimators of population size that were developed for
   capture-recapture data, but that can be used to estimate the size of
   species assemblages using species accumulation data. Models of detection
   probability account for the underlying sampling process. They permit
   variation in detection probability among species. We illustrate this
   approach using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS).
   We describe other situations where species accumulation data are
   collected under different designs (e.g., over longer periods of time, or
   over spatial replicates) and that lend themselves to of use
   capture-recapture models for estimating the size of the community of
   interest. We discuss the assumptions and interpretations corresponding
   to each situation.}},

Abstract = {{Tranosema rostrale (Brishke) (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae) and Actia
   interrupta Curran (Hymenoptera: Tachinidae) are the two endoparasitoids
   most frequently encountered in low-density populations of the spruce
   budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae),
   in the Quebec City region. Monitoring of attack rates of implanted C.
   fumiferana larvae at two different study sites suggested the possible
   existence of competition between the two parasitoids, with A. interrupta
   seemingly displacing T. rostrale. Here, we show that multiparasitism
   involving these two species does occur in the field, but at a frequency
   too low to explain the seasonal pattern of decline in apparent
   parasitism by T. rostrale that accompanies the rise of A. interrupta
   attack rates. We also provide preliminary evidence, from laboratory
   experiments, that A. interrupta has a competitive advantage over T.
   rostrale and that the success of parasitism by A. interrupta may be
   enhanced by prior parasitism by T. rostrale under certain conditions,
   possibly due to the presence of the latter species' polydnavirus. In
   addition, we describe a PCR-based method that we developed to help
   detect the presence of T. rostrale eggs which often escape detection by
   simple visual examination of the dissected host larvae; DNA sequences
   specific to the polydnavirus injected by the female wasp at the time of
   oviposition can be readily amplified from whole host larvae.}},

Abstract = {{This study examins the flexibility of the reproductive styles in St.
   Peter's tilapia, Sarotherodon galilaeus (Cichlidae). Three years of
   monitoring and filming 111 reproduction cycles involving 15 individually
   marked males, revealed their behavioural repertoire to contain 12
   dominant groups of tactics (marked A to L), revolving around three
   parameters: territoriality (T) or non-territoriality (NT) during
   spawning; brooding-participating (Br) or non participating (NBr) in
   brooding eggs; and pairing (P) or not forming (NP) pair bond with the
   selected female. The males demonstrate an ability to select alternative
   reproductive styles (ARS) that presented various combinations of the
   three major parameters. The most dominant group comprised T
   (territorial) males, which tended not to brood eggs and to desert the
   female after mating. However, over various reproductive cycles the same
   males also altered their behaviour from one tactic to another.
   Territoriality was the most conservative tactic, while brooding or not
   brooding was the most frequently changed tactic. Some types of males
   remained with their selected mate for one spawning only, whereas others
   stayed for up to five cycles, showing a high tendency toward monogamy.
   In some instances the presence of additional females influenced the
   decision-making of the male, decreasing his fidelity to his mate. The
   rich variety of reproductive tactics in S. galilaeus males and their
   ability to change from one tactic to another, characterizes the high
   flexibility and adaptability of this species. These qualities could be
   used to describe ecobehavioural morphs, similar to descriptions of
   ecomorphological or ecophysiological phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of endemic soil entomopathogens (nematodes and fungi) were
   monitored in vegetable production systems incorporating varying degrees
   of sustainable practices in Fletcher, NC. Two tillage types
   (conventional plow and disk versus conservation tillage), two input
   approaches (chemically versus biologically based), and two cropping
   schedules (continuous tomato versus 3-yr rotation of corn, cucumber,
   cabbage, and tomato) were employed in large plots from 1995 to 1998. A
   Galleria mellonella (L.) trap bioassay was used to identify and monitor
   activity of Steinernema carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora,
   Beauveria bassiana, and Metarhizium anisopliae populations during the
   vegetable growing season (April-September). Seasonal detection of
   entomopathogens was significantly higher in conservation compared with
   conventional tillage systems. The strip-till operation did not affect
   levels of detection of S. carpocapsae. Pesticide use significantly
   reduced detection of entomopathogenic fungi. Type of ground cover
   significantly affected temperature in the upper 12 cm of soil; highest
   soil temperatures were observed under black plastic mulch and bare
   ground, whereas lowest temperatures were observed under rye mulch and
   clover intercrop. The high soil temperatures associated with certain
   ground covers may have reduced entomopathogen detection or survival.
   Although type of tillage appeared to be the primary factor affecting
   survival of endemic soil entomopathogens in our system, other factors,
   such as pesticide use and type of ground cover, can negate the positive
   effects of strip-tillage.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{142-148}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), oviposition preferences were
   determined on five host plants: cabbage (Brassica oleracea capitata L.),
   cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.),
   pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus
   L.) in no-choice, two-choice, and five-choice tests. Tests were
   conducted in the laboratory, greenhouse, and field cages. Oviposition
   preferences were compared on the basis of two measurements, the
   proportion of eggs laid on the plants to total that were deposited, and
   the oviposition preference index defined as {[} (number of eggs laid on
   the plant) - (number of eggs laid on the cage)] X 100/total number of
   eggs laid. The proportion of eggs laid on the plants to total that were
   deposited was highest for pigweed and lowest for cabbage in all tests.
   Beet armyworm females were significantly deterred from laying eggs on
   cabbage and sunflower, while pigweed and cotton elicited a positive
   oviposition preference. Pepper tended to be neutral or slightly
   unattractive. Apparent interactions among plant species in choice tests
   produced measurable shifts in oviposition preference. Most notably,
   female response to pepper was enhanced in the presence of cotton or
   pigweed. Egg masses laid on the plants contained significantly higher
   numbers of eggs than those laid on the surface of the cage, except in
   the case of cabbage leaves. Knowledge of hierarchies of host plant
   oviposition preference by beet armyworm females will be useful in
   understanding the population dynamics of this important agricultural
   pest, and for developing effective monitoring and management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out on single
   colonies of Pediastrum duplex present in air-dried preparations of mixed
   phytoplankton samples isolated from a eutrophic freshwater lake. FTIR
   absorption spectra had 12 distinct bands over the wavenumber range
   3300-900 cm(-1) which were tentatively assigned to a range of chemical
   groups, including -OH (residual water, wavenumber 3299 cm(-1)), -CH2
   (lipid. 2924), -C=O (cellulose. 1739), amide (protein, 1650 and 1542),
   >P=O (nucleic acid, 1077) and -C-O (starch, 1151 and 1077). Measurement
   of band areas identified residual water, protein and starch as the major
   detectable constituents. Areas of single bands and combined bands of
   -CH(2), -C-O and > P=O species normalized to protein (to correct for
   differences in specimen hydration and thickness) showed wide variation
   between colonies, indicating environmental heterogeneity. Correlation
   analysis demonstrated close statistical associations between different
   molecular species. Particularly high levels of correlation between bands
   3/4 (CH(2)), 6/7 (amide) and 8/9 (-CH(3)) was consistent with their
   joint origin from the same molecular species. The isolation of bands 11
   and 12 in the correlation pattern was confirmed by factor analysis,
   suggesting that variation in the level of starch is statistically
   unrelated to other macromolecules being monitored. The use of FTIR
   spectroscopy to characterize an algal micro-population within mixed
   phytoplankton has potential for future studies on biodiversity and
   environmental interactions at the species level.}},

Abstract = {{First-year seedlings of black cherry, representing 10 open-pollinated
   families from wild parents, were exposed in CSTR chambers to replicated
   treatments of 30,60, 90, and 120 ppb ambient ozone for a 7 hr day(-1), 5
   day wk(-1). Stem height, occurrence of leaf senescence, and visible
   foliar injury expressed as adaxial stipple were measured weekly during
   the 10 wk duration of exposure. Basal stem diameters were measured
   before and after fumigation. Stipple began to occur in week I of the 120
   ppb ozone treatment, week 2 of the 90 ppb treatment, and week 4 of the
   60 ppb treatment. No stipple occurred on any seedlings exposed to 30 ppb
   ozone. Premature leaf senescence occurred in all treatments, but sooner
   and more severely at higher concentrations of ozone. Relative diameter
   growth rates declined as ozone concentrations increased. Families
   differed significantly in their response to ozone treatments in severity
   of adaxial stipple, but not in leaf senescence or height or diameter
   growth. Family heritability estimates for foliar injury, calculated by
   treatment and week of measurement, were generally above 0.5 in the 90
   and 120 ppb ozone treatments. The relative ozone sensitivity of these 10
   families under CSTR conditions corresponded well with sensitivity
   rankings of their 27-yr-old parents, replicated in a clonal seed
   orchard, and growing under ambient ozone exposures. The existence of
   localized, heritable variation in ozone sensitivity in wild populations
   has obvious implications for the use of bioindicators in forest health
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Argan (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels) flowering was observed at Ait
   Melloul, Ait Baha and Argana, three sites in the south-west of Morocco
   during two seasons, 1994-95 and 1995-96. Glomerule count was monitored
   on first-year and on last-year growth shoot every twenty days. Season
   was the primary source of variation of glomerule count on argan
   first-year and last-year growth shoots. The first season was very dry
   when flowering began late April, while the second was very humid and
   flowering started early December. In both cases flowering precocity was
   associated to precipitation precocity, i.e. flowering would commence
   when approximately 100 mm rain was accumulated. High positive
   correlation between glomerule count and precipitation were observed.
   But, considering the two seasons, glomerule count always attained its
   population maximum in spring even if differences were observed between
   sites. However, intensity and duration of the peak were also distinct
   depending on shoot type: on first-year growth shoot, glomerules were
   abundant but would last for a short period, whereas on last-year growth
   shoot, they were less frequent but would last for a longer period. Not
   all trees flowered during a season, although some trees flowered every
   season, showing the extremes of the large variability observed for
   glomerule count abundance and duration within argan populations.}},

Abstract = {{Imunocompetence is usually monitored using a tiered approach that is
   based upon several parameters including immunopathology, immune
   function, and host resistance. Through the efforts of numerous
   investigations, well-characterized immune assays validated in rodents
   for their sensitivity and reproducibility in assessing
   xenobiotic-induced immunotoxicity are currently available. Recently,
   many of these same endpoints have been utilized in non-mammalian species
   as indicators to predict chemical-induced immunotoxicity. In this
   laboratory, immune assays that measure immunopathology, antibody-forming
   cell response to T-dependent antigens, lymphocyte proliferation,
   macrophage function, antioxidant activity, and host resistance against
   infectious bacteria have been employed successfully to assess metal-,
   pesticide-, aromatic hydrocarbon-, and mixture-induced immunotoxicity in
   laboratory-reared Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). These same assays
   have also proven successful in feral fish populations for predicting
   risk(s) associated with habitation in contaminated aquatic environments.
   For example, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) collected from a
   polychlorinated biphenyl-contaminated site had reduced phagocyte
   function, oxyradical production, and antioxidant levels (compared to
   reference fish), while circulating leukocyte profiles and lymphocyte
   proliferation by splenic T-cells were altered in organochlorine-exposed
   walleye (Stizostedium vitreum vitreum). Results of the aforementioned
   studies demonstrate that immune assays developed and validated in a
   laboratory fish model can be successfully applied to feral fish
   populations to predict the toxicological hazards associated with
   exposure to immunomodulating aquatic pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrifying activated sludge from natural domestic sewage was entrapped
   in hydrogel beads, which were subsequently enriched for nitrifiers in a
   continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Fluorescently labelled, 16S
   rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes specific for ammonia and nitrite
   oxidisers were used in combination with DAPI staining to monitor the
   selectivity of the enrichment process. The growth of both nitrifying and
   heterotrophic bacteria was more pronounced in the periphery of the
   beads, leading to a biofilm-like stratification of the biomass during
   the enrichment. Quantitatively, the relative number of nitrifiers
   increased from 20\% immediately after immobilisation up to 64\% after 30
   days, but decreased again due to extensive heterotrophic growth. These
   changes were accompanied by an increase in nitrifying activity for about
   30 days, whereupon it reached a stable level. This selective enrichment
   was mathematically modelled by applying finite difference techniques to
   the diffusion-reaction mass balances of all soluble substrates relevant
   in the nitrification process. To model biomass growth and spreading,
   balanced by both decay and detachment at the surface of the beads, the
   differential methods were combined with a descrete cellular automaton
   approach. The spatially two-dimensional model was used to calculate
   radial concentration profiles within a gel bead, as well as to estimate
   the corresponding total activity of the reactor. Qualitatively, this
   model could simulate all essential aspects observed experimentally.
   However, more and better population data as well as independent
   estimates of decay and hydrolysis rates are needed to refine and verify
   the quantitative model. In conclusion, even in the absence of an
   external carbon source and with excess ammonium, it was only possible to
   obtain a moderate enrichment of nitrifying cells compared to
   heterotrophs. Under long-term cultivation, the biofilm-like structure
   developed in the outer gel layers led to a vigorous competition between
   auto- and heterotrophs for space, and thereby, access to oxygen. FISH
   analysis in combination with mathematical modelling constitute a
   suitable toolbox for analysing the population dynamics and biocatalytic
   performance of such an ecosystem based on lithoautotrophic primary
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Whale displacement by acoustic ``pollution{''} has been difficult to
   document, even in cases where it is strongly suspected, because noise
   effects can rarely be separated from other stimuli. Two independent
   studies on the natural history of killer whales (Orcinus orca) monitored
   frequency of whale occurrence from January 1985 through December 2000 in
   two adjacent areas: Johnstone Strait and the Broughton Archipelago. Four
   high-amplitude, acoustic harassment devices (AHDs) were installed
   throughout 1993 on already existing salmon farms in the Broughton
   Archipelago, in attempts to deter predation on Fish pens by harbour
   seals (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus). While whale occurrence was relatively
   stable in both areas until 1993, it then increased slightly in the
   Johnstone Strait area and declined significantly in the Broughton
   Archipelago while AHDs were in use, Both mammal-eating and fish-eating
   killer whales were similarly impacted. Acoustic harassment ended in the
   Broughton Archipelago in May 1999 and whale occurrence re-established to
   baseline levels. This study concludes that whale displacement resulted
   from the deliberate introduction of noise into their environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Ovigerous female Nephrops were collected by trawl and creel and
   maintained in individual containers over the nine-month incubation
   period to investigate aspects of fecundity. Females which extruded eggs
   in captivity shortly after capture provided an estimate of mean realised
   fecundity of 104.3 eggs g(-1) live weight (s.e.=2.7). Egg loss during
   incubation, estimated by sampling ovigerous females from research trawl
   hauls at different times of year, was 36.7 eggs g(-1) (s.e.=3.3). A
   similar value was obtained by monitoring individuals kept in the
   hatchery. Mean effective fecundity at the time of hatching was estimated
   as 67.6 eggs g(-1) (s.e.=4.3) and is the difference between the number
   of eggs extruded (realised fecundity) and egg losses during incubation.
   The abundance of larvae at development stages I, II, and III was
   estimated over a series of surveys using high-speed plankton samplers.
   Abundance values were converted to daily production values using
   relationships between temperature and stage-duration. Annual larval
   production by stage was estimated by fitting Gaussian curves to the
   survey estimates. The mortality rate of larvae (Z=0.033 d(-1);
   s.e.=0.006) was estimated from the values of annual production by stage,
   using a maximum likelihood method. Annual production at hatching,
   estimated as the intercept of the mortality curve, was 440 x 10(9)
   larvae (s.e.=62 x 10(9)). The biomass of mature female Nephrops in the
   western Irish Sea in 1995 was estimated from annual larval production
   and mean fecundity to be 6290 t (CV=0.17). The current ICES estimate of
   female SSB in 1995 of 7750 t, obtained from analysis of commercial catch
   data, lies within the 95\% confidence limits for the ALP estimate. This
   indicates that current estimates of fishing mortality for female
   Nephrops in the Irish Sea may be robust.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1. We asked 229 authors who have published recently in the Journal of
   Applied Ecology (1999-2001) whether their papers made management or
   policy recommendations and whether they had evidence of consequent
   uptake.
   2. A total of 108 respondents working in the UK (34\%). Europe (30\%),
   the Americas (12\%), Australasia (11\%), Asia (7\%) and Africa (6\%)
   reported on I 10 papers. They represented agro-ecosystems (35\%),
   temperate forests or woodlands (16\%), savanna, grass or arid lands
   (11\%), rivers or wetlands (10\%), estuaries or marine systems (7\%) and
   tropical forests (5\%). The major organisms were invertebrates (27\%),
   birds (24\%), mammals (21\%) and higher plants (21\%). Topics apparently
   under-represented in recent coverage include ecosystem science, urban
   areas, soils, mountain systems, fish, amphibians and lower organisms
   such as algae.
   3. Almost all papers (99\%) carried recommendations and for 57\% there
   was evidence of uptake in the broad categories of `environmental
   management or models', `information, training and education' and
   `monitoring and assessment'. Most uptake involved large geographical
   scales through habitat or species management plans (32\% of cases),
   effects on reserve design or designation (6\%), and effects on
   agri-environmental policy (5\%). The development of further research
   (11\%), the communication of methods to other ecologists (9\%), the
   dissemination of recommendations to practitioners or agencies (7\%), and
   uptake in training or education (5\%) were important uses of
   information.
   4. Prestige from publication in the Journal of Applied Ecology, aided
   several authors in convincing end-users of research value. User
   involvement in research as participants or funders was widespread (>42\%
   of papers), a fact which almost certainly promotes uptake along with the
   parallel dissemination of management messages. We view applied issues as
   an important interface between end-users and ecologists of value to
   `both' communities but suggest that improved communication will further
   benefit the sponsorship and application of ecological science.
   5. The major reason offered for lack of uptake was that it was still too
   soon after publication (21\% of respondents). Costs, difficulty of
   implementation, the scale of the problem. and `challenges to existing
   thinking' each figured in more than one response.
   6. For some respondents, papers were led by curiosity rather than the
   need for direct application. Several authors published in the Journal to
   share ideas internationally, or said that recommendations were general,
   conceptual or long-term rather than specific. of Applied Ecology
   recognize the seminal importance of The editors of the Journal of
   Applied Ecology recognize the seminal importance of contributions that
   affect policy incrementally and conceptually as much as those with
   specific application.
   7. These data provide evidence that ecological science is aiding
   environmental management and policy across a wide range of regions,
   ecosystems and types of organisms; rather than merely detecting
   problems, applied ecology is offering solutions both directly and more
   diffusely through conceptual advance. We invite the user community to
   offer their own perspectives about the value of research-led
   publications such C as this Journal, about how links between researchers
   and users C 2002 British might be strengthened, Ecological Society and
   about how the uptake of applied ecology might be further advanced.}},

Abstract = {{The sesarmid Perisarma guttatum is the most abundant crab species
   inhabiting the lower mangrove areas at Inhaca Island, and presumably an
   ecologically important species in this habitat. Among the scarce
   available information on its population ecology, this species is known
   to follow a semilunar rhythm of larval release, with breeding probably
   extended year-round. In this study, a population of P. guttatum was
   examined, from which estimates of sexual maturity were carried out for
   both sexes, and breeding activity was monitored to describe short-term
   variation of reproductive intensity. In an attempt to relate
   reproductive cycles with recruitment patterns of young, a systematic
   random sampling design was used to quantify and describe the juvenile
   population. Reproductive parameters in adults and density estimates for
   juveniles were obtained from samples taken at 4-d intervals over a 3-mo
   period. Reproductive activity increased over the study period. Females
   released larvae around the new and full moon, but lunar variation of the
   ovigerous ratio with peaks preceding full moon periods indicated that
   different breeding groups may account unevenly for the reproductive
   output of the population. Very young recruits made up the larger
   fraction of the juvenile population, and their density increased from
   the beginning to the end of the sampling season. Density variation
   pattern of first-crab stages followed fortnight cycles, but slow growth
   prevented recruitment pulses to be tracked in size-frequency
   distributions. Polymodal distributions corresponded to recent recruits
   and older juveniles originating from previous settlement seasons. Growth
   rates of identified age groups suggest that sexual maturity in females
   is likely to be achieved after 2 years or more.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated pest management (IPM) tends to be perceived by different
   stakeholder groups either as a methodology for effective pest control or
   as an ideology of responsible environmental stewardship. The IPM process
   has never been subjected to a rigorous empirical test as a control
   methodology in buildings; published studies have either tested isolated
   program components or have presented uncontrolled, sequential
   descriptions of IPM replacing traditional pest control service
   procedures. Because ideological measurement is simpler, cheaper, and
   more relevant than methodological testing to evaluate structural IPM
   performance in the public sector, data on pesticide use/risk and
   customer satisfaction, rather than control efficacy, are used by the
   General Services Administration (GSA) IPM program to demonstrate success
   compatible with Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)
   guidelines. Implementation of IPM in 1989 resulted in significant
   decreases both in quantities of insecticide applied indoors and requests
   for pest control service by building occupants throughout the first
   decade of the program. Although these results do not provide an
   empirical test of structural IPM methodological superiority as a means
   of reducing pest populations, they indicate that replacing sprayed
   insecticide formulations with baits and using client reporting as the
   primary pest surveillance method can successfully achieve the policy
   goals of a large-scale IPM program for public buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted in Kansas corn and soybean fields during 1997 to
   compare various sampling methods, traps, and trap components for
   capturing three species of adult corn rootworms: western (Diabrotica
   virgifera virgifera Leconte), southern (D. undecimpunctata howardi
   Barber), and northern (D. barberi Smith \& Lawrence). Lure constituents
   affected the species of beetle attracted to the trap. Traps with a lure
   containing 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde attracted more western corn
   rootworms, those with a lure containing eugenol were more attractive to
   northern corn rootworms, and those containing trans-cinnamaldehyde were
   most attractive to southern corn rootworms. Multigard sticky traps
   caught more beetles than did Pherocon AM sticky traps. In corn, a newly
   designed lure trap caught more beetles than did sticky traps on most
   occasions. Also, lure-baited sticky traps caught more beetles than did
   nonbaited sticky traps. Varying the color of the lure trap bottom did
   not affect the number caught. In soybeans, the new lure traps captured
   more beetles than did the nonbaited Multigard or Pherocon AM sticky
   traps. Results of this study suggest the new lure trap may provide a
   more accurate assessment of corn rootworm populations than traditional
   monitoring techniques and may be more esthetically pleasing to growers
   and consultants.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a forage allocation model for Theodore Roosevelt National
   Park}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{We developed a forage allocation model using a deterministic, linear
   optimization module in a commercially available spreadsheet package to
   help resource managers in Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP), North
   Dakota determine optimum numbers of four ungulate species, bison (Bison
   bison), elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and feral
   horses, in the Park. TRNP staff actively managed bison, elk, and feral
   horse numbers within bounds suggested by our model from 1983 to 1996.
   During this period, we measured vegetation at 8 grassland and 12 wooded
   sites at 1-3 year intervals to determine if model solutions were
   appropriate for maintaining stable conditions in important plant
   communities in the Park. The data we recorded at these sites indicated
   minimal change in plant communities from 1983 to 1996, Changes in most
   vegetation categories that we expected when animal numbers exceeded
   model optimums for short periods (decreases in coverage/stem numbers of
   palatable plant species, increases in bare ground or unpalatable plant
   species) did not occur consistently under high or low precipitation
   conditions. The lack of sensitivity of our model to decreases in overall
   production of palatable plant species that occurred due to drought,
   fire, expansion of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus)
   colonies, and the spread of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) in areas of
   the Park where we did not have monitoring sites suggested that the model
   under-estimated the total number of ungulates that the Park could
   support. Management for population levels of ungulates defined by the
   model probably led to over protection of common plant communities and
   insufficient protection of rare plant communities. Detecting changes in
   rare plant communities could have been accomplished by re-designing our
   vegetation monitoring program, but changing emphasis to protection of
   rare plants would have likely promoted under use of grazing-tolerant
   habitat types, dissatisfaction in tourists visiting the Park to see
   large mammals, and large increases in cost and intrusiveness of
   management activities such as fencing and control of ungulate
   populations. The model was a flawed representation of grazing dynamics
   in TRNP, but we believe it succeeded in making management personnel
   aware of the biological constraints they face when making management
   decisions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The risk poked by the presence of organochlorine pesticides in milk and
   milk products was estimated for the population of Mumbai. To determine
   the levels of organochlorine pesticides in milk and milk products, a
   monitoring study was carried out in and around Mumbai City. 520 samples
   of milk and milk products of different brands were considered in this
   study. A survey was also conducted to determine the mean daily
   consumption of milk and milk products by different age groups and this
   data was used to evaluate the daily exposure to the public. Non-cancer
   effects were evaluated by comparing the predicted exposure distributions
   to the published guidance values. For chemicals identified as potential
   human carcinogens, cancer risk was evaluated using standard methodology.
   The majority of the chlorinated pesticides identified in the milk and
   milk product samples studied were found to be at levels which do not
   pose unacceptable risks to the public, with the exception of alpha-HCH.
   The cancer risk estimated for this chemical slightly exceeds the US EPA
   guidance value.}},

Abstract = {{Late-spawning Fraser River sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, stocks
   have suffered significant prespawn mortality associated with an
   unusually early freshwater migration pattern and the myxosporean
   parasite Parvicapsula minibicornis. Surveys of migrating adult salmon
   from several spawning populations were conducted in 1999 and 2000 to
   determine the extent of infection with P. minibicornis, when and where
   the parasite first becomes detectable during migration, and whether
   early migrating stocks might be used as sentinels to assess risk of
   infection in late-spawning stocks. Posterior kidney, preserved in 95\%
   ethanol, was examined for P. minibicornis in stained histological
   sections and using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The
   prevalence of this parasite in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks
   examined was high (range 47-100\% infected). In contrast, P.
   minibicornis was not detected in the fish tested from the two sockeye
   salmon stocks outside the Fraser River drainage in either 1999 or 2000.
   The parasite was also not detected histologically or by PCR in the
   kidney tissue of the fish from the Fraser River that were sampled in
   salt water or early during their freshwater migration up the river.
   These findings and the progression in the prevalence and intensity of
   infection as the fish from three stocks (early Stuart, Weaver Creek and
   Cultus Lake) were monitored over time, suggest salmon acquired the
   parasite either in the lower Strait of Georgia or in the lower Fraser
   River before the confluence of the Harrison River. In both 1999 and 2000
   the parasite was present in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks
   sampled, which suggests that early Stuart salmon may be valuable as a
   sentinel stock for the presence of the parasite in later-spawning
   stocks.}},

Abstract = {{This Study, conducted in the Dnieper-Bug Canal in Belarus, is the first
   to monitor the seasonal (June-November) dynamics of infection with the
   parasitic ciliate Ophryoglena sp. in a zebra mussel (Dreissena
   polymorpha) population. Mean population prevalence and intensity of
   infection varied, respectively. from 11 to 62\% and from 0.9 to 24.1
   ciliates/mussel. Mean prevalence was highly correlated with mussel
   length in mussels <20 mm (R-2 = 0.97) and was lower in larger mussels.
   Mean infection intensity in mussels 1-25 mm long was similarly
   correlated with their size (R = 0.98), reached a maximum in the 20-25 mm
   size-class, and then sharply decreased, thus providing evidence. albeit
   limited. that high intensity of infection might be lethal.
   Transinfection of zebra mussels by Ophryoglena sp. was achieved in the
   laboratory-a first for a protozoan parasite of D. polymorpha; from an
   initial complete lack of infection, mean prevalence and intensity rose.

Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of the acmaeid limpet Collisella subrugosa
   (Orbigny) was studied on subtropical Brazilian shores. In a
   semi-sheltered shore at Ubatuba, monthly monitoring indicated that
   densities were higher in the mid-intertidal, and lower in the high- and
   low-intertidal. There was evidence of continuous recruitment mainly to
   mid- and lower levels on the shore, with a peak in the summer. Shell
   length increased with tidal height, and this pattern was maintained
   during the study period. To verify whether these results were consistent
   over a larger spatial scale, the vertical distribution of size,
   abundance, and shell shape of C. subrugosa was studied along a wave
   exposure gradient. Densities were not clearly related to wave action,
   and other sources of variation such as presence of competitors or
   secondary substrata appear to influence C. subrugosa distribution. Shell
   length increased towards the upper intertidal on more exposed shores,
   but no differences, or the reverse pattern was recorded on sheltered
   shores. These results are consistent with other studies on limpet
   distribution, and proposed causes include differential recruitment,
   migration, or microhabitat availability. Shell height increased faster
   with shell length in lower intertidal levels, and on more exposed sites.
   Foot surface area also increased faster with shell length on more
   exposed shores and indicate that wave action is an important factor
   determining shell shape in C. subrugosa. Additional sampling of upper
   and lower populations along a gradient of wave exposure in Florianopolis
   (southern Brazil) resulted in similar patterns of shell size, but the
   relationships between shell height and length for these populations were
   similar and isometric. Thus, there is a geographic variation in the
   vertical distribution of C. subrugosa, and possible causes include
   distinct physical conditions or differences in phenotypic plasticity of
   this limpet.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of increase, survival and reproduction were studied in two
   re-introduced populations of mountain ungulates, the Pyrenean chamois
   (also named isard, Rupicapra pyrenaica) and the ibex (Capra ibex) in the
   French Alps. The populations were monitored from 1983 to 1998 (ibex) or
   1984 to 1999 (isard) using capture, marking and resighting of
   individuals. Population rates of increase were estimated during the
   colonizing phase from: (1) a time series of estimates of population
   size; (2) projection matrices based on rates of survival and fecundity.
   Both populations had exponential rates of increase, with annual
   multiplication rates of 1.28 for isard and 1.30 for ibex. Age of first
   reproduction was 2 years in both species, with 77\% of females breeding
   at this age in isard and 43\% in ibex. From 3 years of age onwards, 90\%
   of isard and 87\% of ibex females bred each year. Survival rates of
   adult females, estimated using capture-recapture models, equalled 0.94
   for isard and 0.98 for ibex, whatever the age and year. The projection
   matrix led to a slightly lower asymptotic multiplication rate than the
   time series of population size. Despite adult body size of the ibex
   being about twice that of the isard, no difference was detected in the
   intrinsic rate of increase between the two species. This supported the
   hypotheses of homogeneous life-history traits among ungulates, varying
   little with body size.}},

Abstract = {{A periodical survey of the growth of an intertidal encrusting sponge
   Halichondria okadai was conducted on a rocky intertidal shore on the Izu
   Peninsula, southern Japan. The area covered by each of 16 marked sponges
   was monitored, and the fusion and fission of specimens were recorded
   from June 1995 to June 1998. During the investigation, 15 of the
   original specimens managed to survive accompanying fusions or fissions
   and only one colony completely disappeared. Ten fusions and 23 fissions
   were observed in total. The maximum death rate during a semilunar period
   was 16.7\% and cumulative mortality throughout the study period was
   46.1\%, indicating that the mortality of H. okadai is lower than that of
   other species previously reported. There was no particular seasonal
   pattern in the occurrences of fusion, fission and death of sponges.
   However, fissions were frequently observed in the latter half of the
   study period and were sometimes followed by fusions or death of
   specimens. Positive growth rates were often observed during warmer
   months, and specimens showed little growth or regression in winter.
   Seasonal patterns in surface area were thought to be related to
   seasonality in reproductive activity.}},

Abstract = {{ions of dollars are spent annually on watershed restoration and stream
   habitat improvement in the U.S. Pacific Northwest in an effort to
   increase fish populations. It is generally accepted that watershed
   restoration should focus on restoring natural processes that create and
   maintain habitat rather than manipulating instream habitats. However,
   most process-based restoration is site-specific, that is, conducted on a
   short stream reach. To synthesize site-specific techniques into a
   process-based watershed restoration strategy, we reviewed the,
   effectiveness of various restoration techniques at improving fish
   habitat arid developed a hierarchical strategy for prioritizing them.
   The hierarchical strategy we present is based on three elements: ( I)
   principles of watershed processes, (2) protecting existing high-quality
   habitats, and (3) current knowledge of the effectiveness of specific
   techniques. Initially, efforts should focus on protecting areas with
   intact processes and high-quality habitat. Following a watershed
   assessment, we recommend that restoration focus on reconnecting isolated
   high-quality fish habitats, such as instream or off-channel habitats
   made inaccessible by culverts or other artificial obstructions. Once the
   connectivity of habitats within a basin has been restored, efforts
   should focus on restoring hydrologic, geologic (sediment delivery and
   routing), and riparian processes through road decommissioning and
   maintenance, exclusion of livestock, and restoration of riparian areas.
   Instream habitat enhancement (e.g., additions of wood, boulders, or
   nutrients) should be employed. after restoring natural processes or
   where short-term improvements in habitat are needed (e.g., habitat for
   endangered species). Finally, existing research and monitoring is
   inadequate for all the techniques we reviewed, and additional,
   comprehensive physical and biological evaluations of most watershed
   restoration methods are needed.}},

Abstract = {{In the intensely farmed corn-growing regions of the mid-western USA,
   surface waters have often been contaminated by herbicides, principally
   as a result of rainfall runoff occurring shortly after application of
   these to corn and other crops. In some vulnerable watersheds, water
   quality criteria for chronic human exposure through drinking water are
   occasionally exceeded. We selected three settings representative of
   vulnerable corn-region watersheds, and used the PRZM-EXAMS model with
   the Index Reservoir scenario to predict corn herbicide concentrations in
   the reservoirs as a function of herbicide properties and use pattern,
   site characteristics and weather in the watersheds. We compared
   herbicide application scenarios, including broadcast surface pre-plant
   atrazine and alachlor applications with a glyphosate pre-plant
   application, scenarios in which losses of herbicides were mitigated by
   incorporation or banding, and scenarios in which only glyphosate or
   glufosinate post-emergent herbicides were used with corn genetically
   modified to be resistant to them. In the absence of drift, in almost all
   years a single runoff event dominates the input into the reservoir. As a
   result, annual average pesticide concentrations are highly correlated
   with annual maximum daily values. The modeled concentrations were
   generally higher than those derived from monitoring data, even for
   no-drift model scenarios. Because of their lower post-emergent
   application rates and greater soil sorptivity, glyphosate and
   glufosinate loads in runoff were generally one-fifth to one-tenth those
   of atrazine and alachlor. These model results indicate that the
   replacement of pre-emergent corn herbicides with the post-emergent
   herbicides allowed by genetic modification of crops would dramatically
   reduce herbicide concentrations in vulnerable watersheds. Given the
   significantly lower chronic mammalian toxicity of these compounds, and
   their vulnerability to breakdown in the drinking water treatment
   process, risks to human populations through drinking water would also be
   reduced. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization and associated landscaping has increased the abundance of
   year-round habitat for waterfowl, resulting in vegetation damage, loss
   of recreational activities, air transportation mishaps and health
   hazards. As part of a research program to develop socially acceptable
   techniques for management of pest bird populations, we are evaluating
   nicarbazin as a contraceptive in pest and surrogate avian species. As
   reproductive studies with Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) are tedious
   due to the difficulty of conducting controlled field studies and/or
   breeding geese in captivity, we evaluated the effects of oral nicarbazin
   administration on the production and hatchability of chicken eggs. Blood
   plasma and egg DNC concentrations were correlated to contraceptive
   efficacy. Subsequent studies are being conducted with geese to determine
   the diet nicarbazin concentration required to produce the desired blood
   and plasma DNC concentrations. This approach permits the expeditious
   evaluation of formulations and dosing regimes by simply monitoring blood

Abstract = {{Resistance to three organophosphate and four pyrethroid insecticides was
   monitored from 1992 to 2000 in field populations of adult whiteflies,
   Bemisia tabaci, from Pakistan using a leaf-dip method. There was
   generally a very high resistance to dimethoate and deltamethrin, and a
   moderate resistance to monocrotophos during 1992 to 1996. From 1997 to
   2000, resistance to these insecticides dropped to low levels because of
   less reliance on them for whitefly control, and introduction of new
   chemistries with novel modes of action that had no cross-resistance to
   conventional insecticides. Concurrently, whitefly resistance to
   acephate, fenpropathrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin mostly
   remained low. An insecticide resistance management strategy is
   recommended that particularly emphasizes the rotation of still-effective
   insecticides from different chemical classes along with the use of novel
   chemicals and other tactics of integrated pest management. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Abamectin resistance monitoring with the two-spotted spider mite,
   Tetranychus urticae Koch, using a diagnostic dose revealed resistant
   strains from the Netherlands (NL-00), Colombia (COL-00), and Brazil
   (BR3-00). Resistance to abamectin in these strains was associated with
   significantly enhanced O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin mediated by
   cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases (MFO). The abamectin-resistant
   strains NL-00 and COL-00 showed severalfold higher MFO activity than the
   susceptible strain GSS. Furthermore a higher glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) activity was detected toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB)
   and monochlorobimane, a new substrate leading to a fluorescent product
   upon conjugation with glutathione. The measured 1.6- and 2.0-fold
   increases in GST activity toward CDNB in strains COL-00 and NL-00 were
   almost proportional to the resistance factors of 26 and 54.
   respectively. Frequency distribution of GST activity measured by the
   microfluorometric assay using monochlorobimane in homogenates of

   the susceptible strain GSS and the abamectin-resistant strain NL-00. In
   contrast to strain NL-00, abamectin resistance in the Brazilian strain
   was not stable in the laboratory over 6 months and the loss of
   resistance coincided with decreased GST and MFO activity. The
   involvement of GST and MFO in abamectin resistance in T. urticae was
   confirmed by synergism studies with the MFO inhibitor piperonyl butoxide
   and the GST inhibitor diethyl maleate. This paper is the first attempt
   to biochemically describe abamectin resistance in T urticae. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas fluorescens strains producing the antibiotic
   2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) have biocontrol activity against a
   broad spectrum of root and seedling diseases. In this study, we
   determined the effect of genotype on the ability to isolate and quantify
   introduced 2,4-DAPG producers from the rhizosphere of wheat using three
   different methods: traditional dilution plating on selective media,
   colony hybridization followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and
   phlD-specific PCR-based dilution endpoint assay. Regression analysis of
   the population densities of 10 2,4-DAPG-producing P. fluorescens,
   representing five genotypes, determined by the three different methods
   demonstrated that the relationship was linear (P < 0.001) and the
   techniques were very similar (i.e., slopes equal to 1.0). The
   phlD-specific PCR-based assay had a slightly lower limit of detection
   than the other two methods (log 3.3 versus log 4.0 CFU/g of fresh root
   weight). With the colony hybridization procedure, we observed that the
   phlD probe, derived from strain P. fluorescens Q8rl-96, hybridized more
   strongly to colonies of BOX-PCR genotypes D (strains W2-6, L5.1-96,
   Q8rl-96, and Q8r2-96) and K (strain F113) compared with strains of
   genotypes A (Pf-5 and CHA0), B (Q2-87), and L (1M1-96 and W4-4). Colony
   hybridization alone overestimated the actual densities of some strains,
   thus requiring an additional PCR step to obtain accurate estimates. In
   contrast, population densities estimated for three of the bacterial
   treatments (strains CHA0, W2-6, and Q8r2-96) with the PCR-based assay
   were significantly (P < 0.041) smaller by 7.6 to 9.2\% and 6.4 to 9.4\%
   than population densities detected by the dilution plating and colony
   hybridization techniques, respectively. In this paper, we discuss the
   relative advantages of the different methods for detecting 2,4-DAPG
   producers.}},

Abstract = {{We used the walked-line transect method for estimating the density of
   cats and coefficients of variation of density estimates in 4 contrasted

   Density estimates varied from 0.44 +/- 0.15 cats per km(2) to 2.42 +/-
   0.23 cats per km(2) according to site and period. Coefficient of
   variation of density estimates ranged from 11.92\% 1 0 to 34.76\%. The
   line transect method was, therefore. an efficient method for monitoring
   the density of the cat population in a sub-Antarctic environment
   characterised by short vegetation. Our results suggest that cat
   population size at the main island of Iles Kerguelen (the total number
   of cats expected is around 7,000) is much lower than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Avicennia marina is an important mangrove species with a wide
   geographical and climatic distribution which suggests that large amounts
   of genetic diversity are available for conservation and breeding
   programs. In this study we compare the informativeness of AFLPs and SSRs
   for assessing genetic diversity within and among individuals,
   populations and subspecies of A. marina in Australia. Our comparison
   utilized three SSR loci and three AFLP primer sets that were known to be
   polymorphic, and could be run in a single analysis on a capillary
   electrophoresis system, using different-colored fluorescent dyes. A
   total of 120 individuals representing six populations and three
   subspecies were samplcd. At the locus level, SSRs were considerably more
   variable than AFLPs, with a total of 52 alleles and an average
   heterozygosity of 0.78. Average heterozygosity for AFLPs was 0.193, but
   all of the 918 bands scored were polymorphic. Thus, AFLPs were
   considerably more efficient at revealing polymorphic loci than SSRs
   despite lower average heterozygosities. SSRs detected more genetic
   differentiation between populations (19 vs 9\%) and subspecies (35 vs
   11\%) than AFLPs. Principal co-ordinate analysis revealed congruent
   patterns of genetic relationships at the individual, population and
   subspecific levels for both data sets. Mantel testing confirmed
   congruence between AFLP and SSR genetic distances among, but not within,
   population comparisons, indicating that the markers were segregating
   inde- pendently but that evolutionary groups (populations and
   subspecies) were similar. Three genetic criteria of importance for
   defining priorities for ex situ collections or in situ conservation
   programs (number of alleles, number of locally common alleles and number
   of private alleles) were correlated between the AFLP and SSR data sets.
   The congruence between AFLP and SSR data sets suggest that either
   method, or a combination, is applicable to expanded genetic studies of
   mangroves. The codominant nature of SSRs makes them ideal for further
   population-based investigations, such as mating-system analyses, for
   which the dominant AFLP markers are less well suited. AFLPs may be
   particularly useful for monitoring propagation programs and identifying
   duplicates within collections, since a single PCR assay can reveal many
   loci at once.}},

Abstract = {{The co-evolutionary arms race model for plant-pathogen interactions
   implies that resistance (R) genes are relatively young and monomorphic.
   However, recent reports show R gene longevity and co-existence of
   multiple R genes in natural populations. This indicates that R genes are
   maintained by balancing selection, which occurs when loss of the
   matching avirulence (Avr) gene in the pathogen is associated with
   reduced virulence. We reason that balancing selection favors R proteins
   that function as guards, monitoring changes in the virulence target
   mediated by the Avr factor, rather than recognizing the Avr factor
   itself. Indeed, the available experimental data support the notion that
   guarding is prevalent in gene-for-gene interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of juvenile Atlantic halibut from three areas of the North
   Atlantic (Canada, Iceland and Norway) was studied in an experiment using
   individual tagged fish reared at 15degreesC for 85 days. Fish from each
   population were subsequently split into two groups and acclimatised to
   either 12degreesC or 18degreesC. The fish were then injected
   intra-peritoneally with a Vibrio anguillarum bacteria suspension and
   mortality monitored for 4 weeks. Growth rates of the Canadian population
   ranked lowest, whereas the Norwegian population had the highest mean
   growth rates (SGR = 1.70\% day(-1), 1.62\% day(-1) and 1.53\% day(-1)
   for the Norwegian, Icelandic and Canadian populations, respectively).
   The halibut from Norway had the best survival following bacterial
   challenge (80\%, 50\% and 55\% survival for the Norwegian, Icelandic and
   Canadian populations, respectively). Mortality was higher at 18degreesC
   than at 12degreesC in the Icelandic (62\% at 12degreesC and 27\% at
   18degreesC) and Canadian (56\% at 12degreesC and 32\% at 18degreesC)
   fish, whereas a smaller difference between temperatures was observed in
   the Norwegian fish (25\% at 12degreesC and 13\% at 18degreesC). Fish
   that survived the challenge test were those that had grown fastest in
   the growth trial. Low, but significant, correlations between survival
   and size and growth were seen, but these correlations varied between
   populations. In the Canadian population, no correlation between size and
   growth and survival were seen; only size was correlated (r = 0.27) with
   survival in the Icelandic population, whereas both size (r = 0.18) and
   growth (r = 0.17) were correlated with survival in the Norwegian
   population. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A toxicological survey of 74 Australian field populations of Lucilia
   cuprina was used to describe the range of responses of first-instar
   larvae to ivermectin in an in-vitro bioassay. All populations were
   susceptible with only a 4-fold difference between the least and most
   tolerant populations at the LC50 level. The frequency distribution of
   LC50s was normally distributed around the mean of 9.8 mug/L. The data
   recorded will provide a susceptible baseline for resistance monitoring
   when ivermectin is again released for the control of flystrike on sheep.}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{9-22}},
Abstract = {{Rodent dynamics was once equated with 3-4 year cycles but is now
   understood to be many-facetted. In a typology of dynamics, including
   stable and resource-driven populations, extensive cycles and travelling
   waves appear to have many features in common. They differ mainly in the
   spatial extent of the cycles or waves. Both types of dynamics
   demonstrate lag phases. Lagged dynamics may be caused by several agents
   but specialist and nomadic predators are particularly evaluated in this
   treatise. The main conclusion is that present understanding of predator
   effects is limited and partly contradictory, The understanding of local
   dynamics, on a km scale, might be facilitated by considering most rodent
   populations as partially subdivided with patches, on a hectare-scale,
   differing in quality and release of dispersers; an overflow to
   suboptimal patches (a `mass effect') may emerge at fairly unlimited
   immigration. Dynamics may vary along several gradients, and spatially
   and temporally limited studies may only catch fragments of extensive
   population changes. Detailed local studies have to be complemented with
   extensive monitoring of dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Few investigations have been conducted which characterise seasonal
   flight patterns of antlions, because of their usual small population
   size, sporadic and local occurrence, and sampling difficulties.
   Night-active myrmeleontids are attracted to light source so light
   trapping can collect them. The authors have monitored the seasonal
   flight activity patterns of nine antlion species over more than 20 years
   using regular nightly operation of the 60 light traps of the Hungarian
   light trap network.
   Generally, the seasonal activity of adult antlions lasted from early May
   to the end of September, and mass flight. occurred in the period early
   June-late August. Time series analytical methods detected three
   characteristic species-groups with different seasonal flight-types. The
   three groups were: (a) earlier active ``late spring-early summer{''}
   flying antlions (Megistopus flavicornis, Myrmeleon formicarius, Nohoveus
   punctulatus); (b) intermediate ``early and mid-summer{''} flying
   antlions (Distoleon tetragrammicus, Mymeleon inconspicuus, Myrmecaelurus
   trigrammus); (c) later ``mid- and late summer{''} flying antlions
   (Creoleon plumbeus, Euroleon nostras, Acanthaclisis occitanica). Within
   groups the flight patterns were synchronised. One to four 10-day
   interval temporal separations were found between general activity
   patterns of groups. Further studies are needed to understand the
   ecological background to the differences between the seasonal flights of
   myrmeleontid species.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored Lake Baikal omul populations (Posolskaya, Selenginskaya and
   Severobaikalskaya) in spawning rivers (1965-1993) and at lake feeding
   areas (1969-1982) to assess year-class strength during 1964-1980. The
   main factors affecting year-class sizes were the number of spawning
   fish, the number of larvae hatched from eggs, and habitat conditions for
   fry (water flow of spawning rivers and Lake Baikal water level) in the
   lower parts of rivers and bays. High year-class strength was observed in
   periods of increased water flow in some rivers and rising water levels
   in Lake Baikal. Fluctuations of lake level and commercial omul catches
   were connected with cyclic climate changes (warming and precipitation)
   in the northern hemisphere and the Lake Baikal basin.}},

Abstract = {{The water level of Lake 226, a small lake in northwestern Ontario, was
   experimentally lowered during three successive winters, 1994 to 1996, to
   evaluate changes in an unexploited lake whitefish (Coregonus
   clupeaformis) population. The drawdown was 2 in during the first winter
   and 3 in during the next two winters. Lake whitefish abundance decreased
   by more than 80\% during the three years of drawdown, due to recruitment
   failures and decreased annual survival, Annual Survival was much lower
   during the first year of drawdown than the succeeding two years.
   Survival was particularly low during the first winter of drawdown,
   possibly caused by anoxic conditions under ice after the drawdown was
   completed. Lake whitefish condition increased during drawdown, but the
   increase was not as great as we expected if it were entirely a
   density-dependent response. Recruitment of Lake 226 lake whitefish
   resumed after the final year of drawdown and condition decreased. The
   changes documented in Lake 226 during drawdown did not occur for this
   population during the 10 years prior to drawdown or for the take
   whitefish population in the Lake 468 that was monitored during the
   entire 14 year study period.}},

Abstract = {{A monitoring programme was begun in 1988 to provide forecasts to
   fishermen and fisheries managers as a decision-making tool and increase
   knowledge of vendace (Coregonus albula) stocks in Finland. About 90
   vendace lakes were monitored annually, and questionnaires were sent to
   commercial fishermen (n = 120-140) to classify the relative abundances
   of adult vendace and 0+ vendace into five classes. Since 1996, some
   fishermen have volunteered to measure the lengths of 0+ vendace. The
   vendace abundances in southern Finland were low from 1988 to 1995 due to
   poor recruitment. The lowest adult abundance (index = 2.3) overall was
   documented in 1991. The adult abundance reached the average level (index
   = 3.0) in western Finland in 1994 and in eastern Finland in 1995. During
   the recession in abundance in southern Finland, vendace stocks stayed
   abundant in northern Finland. The recession did not seem to depend on
   the size of the lakes. Since 1996, successful catch predictions have
   been possible based mainly on the abundance and length of 0+ vendace.
   From 1996-1998, the mean length of 0+ vendace in the monitored lakes
   ranged from 4 to 17 cm (mean 10.5 cm). Differences between regions were
   statistically significant (P < 0.001), and the smallest 0+ vendace live
   in northern Finland. The adult vendace index adequately characterizes
   long-term changes in vendace, but the index for 0+ vendace is more
   practical when estimating rapid changes and making predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst. subsp. caffra (Sond.) Kokwaro. is
   a common species throughout the semi-arid, deciduous savannas of much of
   sub-Saharan Africa. It is a favoured species and is frequently
   maintained in homestead plots and arable fields in an agroforestry
   situation. Although the abundance and popularity of this species has led
   to several initiatives to commercialise a number of marula products, the
   sustainability of the resource base with respect to fruit production has
   not been considered. This paper reports on a field experiment that
   monitored growth rates and fruit production of a sample of adult trees
   from several wild populations. Mean fruit production was 36.8 kg per
   tree in the first year, and negligible in the second. This was
   considerably less than previous estimates, which were based largely on
   small samples or anecdotal reports. The maximum recorded yield was 416.6
   kg per tree. Fruit production was positively related to the size of the
   tree. Growth rates of adult trees were slow. There was a strong positive
   relationship between mean annual diameter increment and stem diameter.
   The slow growth rates and low fruit yields indicate that more attention
   is required regarding the sustainability of the resource and its ability
   to provide sufficient fruit for the growing subsistence and commercial
   demand at both local and national scales.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon Monoxide (CO) is considered a harmful pollutant emitted mainly by
   motor vehicles. In large cities like Santiago, CO concentrations may
   reach values that exceed the norm that health organizations have
   established as a safe limit to which the population may be exposed ( 10
   mg/m(3), 8 hour moving average), It is important to be able to predict
   with at least 30 hours in advance, when concentrations will exceed this
   limit, because restriction to vehicle circulation may imply it relevant
   decrease with respect to expected values when no actions are taken.
   We show here a study on the possibility to predict maximum values of 8
   hour moving average of CO concentrations using past values of CO
   concentrations and meteorological forecasts as input to multi linear
   regressions and neural network models. The neural network model seems to
   leave more room to adjust free parameters with one year data in order to
   predict the following year values. We have worked with data of three
   years measured in two of the monitoring stations located in the urban
   area of Santiago.}},

Abstract = {{Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) a rapid, nondestructive
   method of analysis requiring minimal sample preparation, was first used
   to predict forage quality in 1976. NIRS has been approved by AOAC for
   moisture, Kjeldahl nitrogen, and acid detergent fiber (ADF). Commercial
   forage testing laboratories have used NIRS for routine analysis of hay,
   haylage, corn silage, and corn grain for moisture, CP, ADF, NDF, Ca, P,
   K, and Mg. The accuracy of NIRS has been dependent upon a calibration
   developed from samples that represent the population to be predicted
   with accurately determined conventional analytical methods. Advances in
   instrument performance have increased spectral accuracy and output
   consistency between instruments. Software advances have improved data
   extraction from spectra, operator understanding of the limitations of
   calibration equations, and the ability of network managers to monitor
   analytical output of instruments from remote locations. A model network
   of NIRS instruments has standardized drying and sample processing
   methods, monitoring of accuracy of reference methods, harmonization of
   network instruments, and monitoring of calibration equations.}},

Abstract = {{As a result modification/destruction of its floodplain habitats,
   Boltonia decurrens (Torr. \& Gray) Wood now is listed as federally
   threatened. We investigated dormancy-breaking and germination
   requirements of achenes, monitored seasonal changes in germination
   responses of buried achenes and determined if buried achenes have the
   potential for long term viability. At maturity in autumn, 70-100\% of
   the achenes germinated in light at high (30/15, 35/20 C), but not at low
   (15/6 C) alternating temperature regimes. Cold stratification during
   winter increased germination percentages, especially at low
   temperatures, and by spring 95-100\% of the achenes germinated over a
   range of temperatures, including those (e.g., 15/6 C) that were
   inhibitory in autumn. Achenes required light for germination, but
   exposure to light during stratification did not promote germination in
   darkness at stimulated spring and/or summer habitat temperatures. Nearly
   100\% of the achenes buried for 88 mo in a nonheated greenhouse were
   viable. Thus, achenes have the capacity for long-term viability when
   buried in soil and subjected to seasonal temperature changes; however,
   soil seed bank studies have not been clone Lit population sites. In both
   spring and autumn during the 88-mo burial period, exhumed achenes
   germinated to high percentages at 20/10, 25/15, 30/15 and 35/20 C, but
   germination at 1510 C was high ill spring and low in autumn. The
   implication of these results is that achenes could germinate in the
   field any time from late March to late October if disturbance resulted
   in their being exposed to light and soil moisture was not limiting.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted the first formal quantitative study of the herpetofauna of
   the Jasper-Pulaski, Willow Slough and LaSalle Fish and Wildlife areas
   (FWA) in northwest Indiana from 1994-1996 to gather baseline data
   necessary to determine distribution and status of species and to monitor
   long-term population trends. We compared our results with those of
   earlier collectors Chapman Grant, Paul Swanson and Sherman Minton. A
   total of 339 populations of 13 amphibian species and 78 populations of
   22 reptile species were encountered from 1994-1996. Only 9 species were
   found at all three FWAs and only 11 were commonly encountered. Sixteen
   new site records and new county records were made while at least 7
   species with validated records before 1972 were not found during this
   survey and may be locally extirpated. The relative abundance of species
   at Jasper-Pulaski FWA has changed between the 1930s and 1990s with
   declines of the thirteen most abundant species and increases in some
   formerly overlooked or rare species. Large-scale changes in habitat may
   be partly responsible for changes in species abundance. All of the
   state-listed species (Acris crepitans blanchardi, Rana blairi, R.
   pipiens, Thamnophis p. proximus, Clemmys guttata, Emydoidea blandingii,
   Kinosternon s. subrubrum, Terrapene o. ornata, Opheodrys vernalis and
   Sistrurus c. catenatus), except Ambystoma laterale, have clearly
   declined.}},

Abstract = {{Hatching success, brood survival and predation rates of red grouse
   chicks were examined at four sites in north-east Scotland over two years
   (1994-1995). Two of these sites have previously been the focus of a
   large-scale population study on grouse during the late 1950s enabling a
   comparison to be made. A total of 85 hens were radio-tracked and their
   breeding success monitored over the two years. Compared with studies
   undertaken in the 1950s, mean clutch size had risen from 7.2 to 8.6
   eggs. Of the 76 nests monitored, 17 (22.4\%) broods were lost either
   through egg or chick predation or by the adult being taken by a predator
   during incubation. Stoats appeared to be responsible for the largest
   amount of egg predation. There was a significant increase in predation
   levels, although hatching success was not significantly different from
   the 1950s. Chick mortality was highest within the first ten days, a
   similar result to that found in the 1950s. Overall, mean brood survival
   from hatching to 20 days was 55.1\%. Possible reasons for larger clutch
   sizes, and the apparent increase in predation levels, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Tylosema esculentum is a long-lived perennial species endemic to and
   areas of southern Africa. Its potential as a crop species has long been
   recognized as a result of the high oil and protein content of its seeds.
   The reproductive biology and breeding systems of the species were
   investigated in wild and experimental populations growing in Botswana.
   Field observations confirmed that the species is heterostylous with the
   pistil and anthers exhibiting reciprocal heights in the two morphs,
   although pollen size and sculpturing do not vary. The wet, non-papillate
   stigma characteristic of the species is the first to be reported in the
   Caesalpinioideae. In vivo and in vitro diallel crossing experiments
   demonstrated that a diallelic self-incompatability system exists in T.
   esculentum. The major site of pollen tube inhibition in the intramorph
   crosses was found to be in the style. This is the first report of
   functional heterostyly in the Fabaceae and of a confirmed
   self-incompatibility system in the Caesalpinioideae. Three separate
   lines of evidence, the monitoring of fruit development in
   open-pollinated plants, fruit set in diallel crossing experiments, and
   observations made in wild populations, demonstrated that fruit set and,
   by implication, seed set, are very low in this species. Floral
   abscission was a major limitation to the production of mature pods but
   there were also significant losses at other developmental stages of
   fruit production. The results suggest that low seed set may be an
   adaptation of the species to an environment in which rainfall is scarce.

Abstract = {{Weekly Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) flight activity, measured as the
   density of captured beetles in pheromone baited traps, was monitored for
   76 consecutive weeks at 16 sites inside the Lama forest in southern
   Benin and at four sites in maize farmland just outside the forest.
   Prostephanus truncatus flight activity was consistently higher and the
   flight activity pattern significantly different near maize stores than
   at sites inside the forest. Although P. truncatus is known to infest
   girdled branches of Lannea nigritana (Sc. Elliot) Keay, the P. truncatus
   flight activity was comparatively low at forest sites where this tree
   species dominated. The main peak in P. truncatus flight activity
   occurred earlier in the eastern part of the forest compared with other
   forest parts. Ordination analysis showed that comparatively higher
   flight activity in the eastern part of the forest was positively
   associated with the presence of teak plantations (Tectona grandis L. F.)
   at trap sites. The spatial distribution of weekly P. truncatus trap
   catches were found to be significantly aggregated during a 21-wk period,
   which largely coincided with the early increase in P. truncatus flight
   activity in the eastern part of the forest. Based on this evidence, it
   was suggested that P. truncatus individuals disperse from the eastern
   part of the forest to other forest parts and to nearby agricultural
   areas, rather than, as has been previously suggested, from maize stores
   to the forest environment.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse subdisciplines within entomology recognize the detection of rare
   individuals as the precursor to effective management of these
   individuals. Unfortunately, detection methods have often developed on a
   case-by-case basis, and advances in one subdiscipline have not carried
   over to similarly related fields. The biology of a particular organism
   will certainly affect sampling methods, but the underlying principles
   governing the power of a sampling strategy to detect rare individuals
   will apply across taxa. Our review of the sampling literature
   demonstrates the common problem of detecting, rare individuals, reviews
   the fundamentals of probability theory as a foundation for any
   monitoring program, and discusses the inferences that can be drawn from
   samples, especially when resources limit sampling efforts. Particular
   emphasis is placed on binomial-, beta-binomial-, and
   hypergeometric-based strategies as they pertain to quarantine
   inspections for exotic pests, veterinary/medical entomology, and
   insecticide resistance monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Four experiments were conducted in order to determine the optimum dosage
   of Azotobacter chroococcum vis-a-vis organic fertilizer (cow-dung)
   required for optimum pond productivity. Hydrobiological parameters of
   pond water, Azotobacter survival ( viable counts), net primary
   productivity (NPP) and fish growth were monitored. Studies have revealed
   that irrespective of the treatments, dissolved oxygen ( DO) levels were
   significantly (P < 0.05) lowered on inoculating the ponds with
   Azotobacter. Alkalinity, O-PO4, NO3-N, turbidity, NPP, plankton
   population and fish growth were significantly ( P < 0.05) enhanced in
   ponds inoculated with Azotobacter @ 100.0 ml pond(-1) w(-2) in
   combination with cow-dung @ 10000 kg ha(-1) y(-1). At higher or lower
   dosages of fertilizers, the values in most of these parameters remained
   low. On the other hand, total kjeldahl nitrogen and NH4-N increased
   continuously. In general, viable bacterial counts decreased with
   increase in pH, however, the rate of nitrogen fixation was not affected.
   Multivariate analysis (Prein et al. 1993) of the data revealed a
   significant positive correlation of nutrients ( Total kjeldahl Nitrogen,
   NO3-N and O-PO4), with NPP and plankton populations. NH4-N, however,
   showed a significant negative correlation with DO, NPP and plankton
   populations. Highest fish biomass and SGR also coincided with the
   highest NPP and plankton populations, revealing that a dose of 100.0 ml
   pond(-1) w(-2) (for 25 m(3) ponds) of Azotobacter along with 10000 kg
   ha(-1) y(-1) of cow-dung appears to be optimum for obtaining optimum
   pond productivity and fish yield. Nutrients in the sediment (NO3-N and
   O-PO4) also followed similar trend. On the other hand, organic carbon
   increased continuously with each increase in the dosage of fertilizers.
   A decline in fish biomass and pond productivity at higher fertilizer
   dosages has been attributed to low DO, high NH4-N and BOD.}},

Title = {{Decline of fish catch in Switzerland - Project Fishnet: A balance
   between analysis and synthesis}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{64}},

Pages = {{36-54}},
Abstract = {{Fish catch, especially of brown trout, has decreased by about 50\% over
   the last 15 years in many Swiss rivers and streams. In addition, the
   health status of brown trout has been reported to be impaired in many
   streams. In order to evaluate the causes of these phenomena, the project
   ``Fishnet{''} was launched in 1998. We present an overview of the
   concepts and approaches of this interdisciplinary nationwide project,
   our experience to date of identifying problems and filling data gaps,
   and the first results from selected sub-projects.
   Fishnet has a planned duration of 5 years and aims to (i) document the
   decline in catch, abundance and impaired health status of fish
   populations in selected rivers, (ii) elucidate the causes of these
   problems, and (iii) develop measures to improve the situation. To
   achieve these aims, a wide variety of research projects are being
   undertaken. In addition to co-ordinating existing projects, Fishnet
   initiates and launches new projects that investigate these issues.
   Monitoring projects are being conducted over a geographically broad area
   to investigate selected aspects of the decline (e.g. the incidence and
   prevalence of diseases). Other studies aim at detailing the
   relationships between suspected causes and observed effects. Twelve
   hypotheses were initially formulated to identify probable causes. These
   include reproductive failure, fish health, habitat degradation, reduced
   quality of habitat, and climatic changes (such as increased water
   temperature and shifts in the seasonal occurrence of floods). Results of
   initial studies point to the differential impact of factors, depending
   on the specific geographic region, the fish species and other factors.
   For example, most of the hypothesized causes are currently found in the
   Swiss midlands.
   By integrating the results and conclusions of existing and new
   sub-projects, solutions for the complex problem of fish decline and
   impaired health will be proposed. Practical measures to address the
   problem will be developed and disseminated to the public and policy
   groups. The various stakeholders will also be involved during the whole
   project. Financial and other forms of support are provided by these
   different par-ties.}},

Abstract = {{The beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) and the bowhead whale (Balaena
   mysticetus) are seasonal migrants to Canada's Western Arctic, occupying
   summer range in the southeastern Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf within
   the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR). These whales also travel through
   United States (Alaskan) and Russian offshore waters, which include
   migration routes and overwintering areas for both species. The beluga
   has for centuries been an important food resource of the aboriginal
   people of the Mackenzie Delta. From 1990 to 1999, the annual subsistence
   harvest of beluga in the ISR averaged 111, while only two bowheads were
   landed during this same period. The minimum size of the Eastern Beaufort
   Sea beluga stock has been estimated at 32 453 whales. The total annual
   removal of beluga by subsistence hunters from the ISR and Alaska is
   estimated at 189 whales, which is less than 0.6\% of the minimum
   estimate of stock size. This level of harvest is sustainable. Between
   1848 and 1921, commercial whalers decimated the Bering Sea population of
   bowhead whales. The size of the population, based on 1993 data, is
   estimated at 8200 (95\% estimation interval of 7200-9400), constituting
   more than 90\% of the world's remaining bowheads. This population
   increased at a rate of 3.2\% from 1978 to 1993, while sustaining a
   harvest of about 0.6\% per year. To ensure the continued well-being of
   these whales and their habitats, it is recommended that existing
   monitoring programs, commitments, and co-management partnerships be
   nurtured and maintained.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored adult and juvenile breeding-season movements and habitat
   use of radio-tagged Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) at the Piedmont
   National Wildlife Refuge, central Georgia, USA. We investigated the
   effects that management for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides
   borealis), thinning and burning >30 year old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)
   habitat, had on Wood Thrushes, a ground-foraging and midstory-nesting
   species. Adult Wood Thrush pairs regularly moved long distances between
   nesting attempts (range I to 17,388 m). The only experimental effect we
   found on adult movements was a decrease in weekly emigration rates (Psi)
   from thinned and burned compartments after silvicultural management.
   Adult males preferred riparian hardwoods with sparse to moderate cover
   and those preferences increased following management. juveniles remained
   near their nest site ((x) over bar = 177 m, SE = 113) for an average 24
   days (SE = 6.3), and then dispersed a mean 2,189 m (SE = 342). Before
   dispersal, juveniles preferred upland hardwood-pine mixed habitat (P <
   0.05) with moderate overstory cover (P < 0.05). We found no management
   effects on dispersal distances or predispersal habitat use. However,
   juveniles from thinned and burned compartments dispersed to hardwood
   habitats with dense cover, whereas birds from control compartments
   dispersed to pine-dominated habitats with sparse cover. All juveniles
   dispersed to areas with habitat similar to what they used before
   dispersal. Small-scale thinning and burning for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers
   may have had little effect on Wood Thrush habitat use and movements
   because typical movements were often larger than the scale (stand or
   compartment) targeted for management.}},

Abstract = {{Acacia species `Dandaragan' is known from one population confined to the
   Dandaragan-Badgingarra area in south-western Western Australia and is
   classified as critically endangered. Morphological and allozyme studies
   show that A. sp. `Dandaragan' has close affinities with Acacia
   microbotrya Benth. sens. lat. and warrants taxonomic recognition at
   subspecies rank. A combination of floral and phyllode characters clearly
   separated A. sp. `Dandaragan' and A. microbotrya s.l. by the presence of
   a discrete morphological boundary in the canonical variates plot and the
   high percentage of correct re-substitution classifications of
   individuals into pre-defined taxa. UPGMA and maximum likelihood analyses
   of allozyme data distinguished A. sp. `Dandaragan' and A. microbotrya s.
   l. Levels of genetic diversity were lower in A. sp. `Dandaragan' than in
   A. microbotrya s. l. The size-class and life-stage structure of the A.
   sp. `Dandaragan' suggests that the population is stable and possibly
   increasing in size predominantly by vegetative spread. The presence of a
   soil seed reserve and the ability to reproduce from root suckers
   suggests that A. sp. `Dandaragan' is resilient to fire. Levels of innate
   seed dormancy were lower and tolerance to thermal shock higher in A. sp.
   `Dandaragan' compared with A. microbotrya s. l. The population size,
   structure and germination ecology suggest that A. sp. `Dandaragan' does
   not appear to have any immediate management requirements, apart from
   continued monitoring of adult plant health and recruitment. The study
   confirms that A. sp. Dandaragan should be recognised as Declared Rare
   (threatened) Flora and we recommend that the taxon's conservation status
   be reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in vegetation, pathogen population and distribution were
   monitored periodically in both defined infested quadrats and similar
   pathogen-free quadrats at six sites representing major types of forest
   and woodland. Assessments were recorded in May 1977, 1979, 1981,
   1983-1984, 1995 and 2000. The susceptible eucalypts in the overstorey of
   infested sites, such as Eucalyptus obliqua, E. baxteri, E. willisii and
   E. macroryncha, showed severe dieback, loss of crown or deaths. All the
   trees died on some sites, others presented dead leaders with epicormic
   growth on lower branches. Dieback followed by death occurred in 54\% of
   the understorey species, including the dominant Xanthorrhoea australis,
   thereby changing community structure and species composition. At the
   time of its greatest prevalence, the pathogen's activity resulted in a
   decline in species richness in infested quadrats to a mean of 25.6
   species compared with a mean of 39.2 for pathogen-free quadrats.
   Percentage cover and percentage contribution to the community by
   susceptible species were negligible. On steep sites, 65\% of the ground
   remained bare, but on other sites the susceptible flora was replaced by
   field-resistant species of sedges and rushes, such as Lepidosperma
   semiteres and Hypolaena fastigiata, and by partly resistant tea-trees
   Leptospermum myrsinoides, L. continentis and L. scoparium. The dense,
   field-resistant understorey consisted of the ground cover of H.
   fastigiata, scattered clumps of various sedges and above this a mass of
   tea-tree scrub, approximately I in in height, with moderately severe
   dieback of the branches.
   From 1976 to 1984, the pathogen was isolated from 100\% of the 345 root
   and soil samples and from all of the infested quadrats, but then
   gradually declined. In 2000, Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands was rare at
   four sites and was not isolated from two sites. Regeneration of 30
   susceptible species, previously eliminated, was recorded from infested
   sites and 21 of these species were growing in more than one quadrat.
   Vigorous regeneration of the previously dominant but highly susceptible
   X. australis occurred at two sites and was similar to that recorded from
   some recovering infested sites in the Brisbane Ranges, Victoria. The
   decline of the pathogen and the regeneration of susceptible species may
   be associated with low spring rainfall from 1995 to 2000 and the
   consequent reduction in zoospore production, enabling a partial recovery
   from dieback. The disease cycle from invasion and destruction of a
   susceptible indigenous flora by this virulent pathogen to the decline of
   the pathogen and the regeneration of that same susceptible indigenous
   flora was almost complete on sections of two of the six sites studied.
   In other areas, the post-infection colonising flora of field-resistant
   species remained dominant, except at one steep site where the ground
   remained uncolonised and subsequently eroded following the death of
   susceptible flora. Extinction following infection by P. cinnamomi,
   however, remains a grave threat to endangered, endemic species if
   susceptible.}},

Abstract = {{Aspects of the demography of Callitris preissii subsp. verrucosa (Cunn.
   ex. Endl.) J. Garden populations were studied in semi-arid mallee
   communities situated on sandy soils in central New South Wales. Rates of
   survival and fecundity were estimated in a range of populations of
   differing age (year of origin or last fire: 1920, 1957, 1972, 1974 and
   1985) that were monitored between 1987 and 1997. Rates of survival of
   juveniles and adults were high (> 0.99 p. a.), although juveniles less
   than 5 years of age survived at lower rates. Estimated seedbank at the
   time of first tagging (no. of closed cones per plant) followed an
   increasing trend with plant age. Density, overstorey, topography and
   within-age-class site factors had significant effects on stored
   seedbanks in particular age-classes. There was high interannual
   variation (1989 v. 1990) in the size of crops of new cones. Trends in
   seedbank with plant age and seed release rates from tagged cones
   indicated that the species exhibits strong serotiny. Measurements of
   litter weight and depth beneath plants from 1920 and 1957 age-classes,
   indicated relatively low fuel loadings (about 0.2 kg m(-2)). Bark was
   sufficiently thick in c. 60-year-old plants to render stems resistant to
   low-intensity fires. Thus, it is predicted that the probability of
   propagation of fire in populations >50 years old may decline and that
   survival of fire in this age range may increase. Given patterns of
   survivorship, fecundity and seedbank accumulation, populations may
   decline when fires are relatively frequent (<15-year interval). At
   longer intervals there is potential for population densities to remain
   stable or increase, although the nature of variability in sizes of
   individual seed crops may have a predominant influence on dynamics. The
   combination of strong serotiny and negative feedback effects of plant
   populations on their flammability is a paradox, given the likelihood
   that seedling establishment is tightly keyed to fire.}},

Abstract = {{I studied the breeding biology of the speckled warbler in a large (>1000
   ha) remnant of eucalypt woodland in the Australian Capital Territory,
   monitoring 160 nesting attempts over three breeding seasons. In many
   aspects of breeding the species is a typical member of the Acanthizinae.
   It laid a small clutch (usually 3 eggs) with a laying interval of two
   days, and had long incubation and nestling periods, 17-20 days and 15-19
   days respectively. There was biparental care of the altricial young and
   fledglings were dependent for a long period; fledglings were fed for
   about 5 weeks and all dispersed about 7 weeks after leaving the nest.
   Females were multi-brooded, fledging up to 3 broods in a season from a
   maximum of 6 clutches, but despite this had a low reproductive rate over
   a long breeding season. Low reproductive success, about 1.0 fledgling
   per female per season, resulted mainly from nest failure due to
   predation; all nests were built directly on the ground and were thereby
   exposed to a wide range of predators and other forms of mishap. The
   implications of this invariable nesting strategy are discussed for
   populations nesting in fragmented landscapes in small remnants of
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the role of matrix type as a determinant of changes in bird
   densities associated with patch area (patch size effect) by studying
   bird distribution in two different landscape contexts: forested islands
   in archipelagos (low quality matrix) and mature forest patches in
   landscape managed by forestry (high quality matrix). We predicted that
   patch area effects (PAE) will be stronger in patches surrounded by a low
   quality matrix in which movements of individuals are more restricted and
   alternative resources not available. We assessed the role of species
   sensitivity to human induced landscape change (estimated from species
   population trends in long term monitoring data) as a predictor of patch
   size effect in forest. birds in different landscape scenarios. Overall
   patch area effects were significantly higher than 0 in real islands but
   not in patches surrounded by a higher quality matrix. Species more
   sensitive to large-scale landscape change showed strong patch size
   effects on islands but not in fragments. Our results suggest that forest
   fragments do not function as real islands mainly because of the
   compensatory effects of the surrounding matrix. However, the significant
   association between large-scale population trends and species responses
   at a local level in patches surrounded by a low quality matrix suggests
   that strong changes in landscape matrix quality might be behind recent
   population decreases of some boreal forest birds.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in population abundance reduces statistical power and
   complicates planning of effective monitoring programs. We studied
   patterns of temporal variation over space in six bird species in
   northern Alberta, Canada. Species with larger body mass did not have
   larger scales of population synchrony, but larger territory sizes were
   roughly associated with larger maximum extents of synchrony. The minimum
   extent of synchrony was 400m to 600m for all species examined, except
   Black-capped Chickadees Parus atricapillus, for which it was 1km.
   Ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapillus, Red-breasted Nuthatches Sitta canadensis
   and Tennessee Warblers Vermivora peregrina were synchronous to 10km,
   Black-capped Chickadee were synchronous to 7km, while White-throated
   Sparrow Zonotrichia albicolis and Yellow-rumped Warbler Dendroica
   coronata did not show synchrony at any distance. Synchrony was strongest
   in Tennessee Warblers and Red-breasted Nuthatches; Red-breasted
   Nuthatches had a regular biannual cycle consistent with cone crop
   periodicity, while Tennessee Warbler abundance was related to spruce
   budworm abundance within Canada. Black-capped Chickadees are more
   abundant in warm years and may also be associated with large cone crops.
   Ovenbird abundance seems to depend on both local effects and factors on
   wintering grounds.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a broader program to assess and monitor the ecological
   integrity of the Greater Kouchibouguac Ecosystem (eastern New Brunswick,
   Canada), we surveyed birds at 259 stations to identify potential
   indicator species. Stations were distributed among four forest and bog
   ecosystem types in a relatively undisturbed area (Kouchibouguac National
   Park) and in an adjacent area disturbed by forestry and human
   settlement. We compared the level of disturbance (as assessed from
   landscape structure) around study sites within versus outside the Park
   but found no statistically significant difference. Potential indicator
   species were selected based on their degree of ecological
   specialization, specialists being considered more susceptible to
   environmental disturbances. Combined with the monitoring of other taxa
   and indicators at higher levels (e.g. landscape change), the population
   trends of the 16 avian indicator species proposed here should provide
   Park managers with the information required to maintain the ecological
   integrity of the Greater Kouchibouguac Ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of Grey Partridges Perdix perdix have declined since the 1950s
   due in part to agricultural intensification, loss of gamekeepers and
   available nesting cover. The Game Conservancy Trust, lead partner for
   the Grey Partridge Biodiversity Action Plan, will undertake to achieve
   three objectives: halt the population decline by 2005, double current
   breeding estimate to 150,000 pairs by 2010 and extend the range of the
   species. Land managers throughout Britain have been recruited, on a
   voluntary basis, both to implement management practices designed to
   increase Grey Partridge numbers and monitor the effect of this
   management. In order to put into context the density of Grey Partridges
   within their area, `target' populations were calculated for their
   holdings. Land cover data was used to classify kilometre squares
   throughout Britain into optimal, sub-optimal and unsuitable Grey
   Partridge habitat, based on approximations of past habitat. Overlaying
   this with the area of land each manager covered allowed minimum expected
   numbers of Grey Partridges to be calculated. This contributed to a
   management document that puts local Grey Partridge recovery in the
   control of each land manager.}},

   densities were however fourfold higher on thermally favorable
   South-facing slopes and year-to-year variation was also considerable.
   However, the densities of none of the observed life history stages were
   correlated with climatic data, although herbivory was negatively
   correlated with growing season temperature. The observed populations of
   R. glacialis have remained remarkable stable, despite a consistent
   warming trend during the last decade. These results in conjunction with

Abstract = {{This study set out to investigate the feasibility of achieving long-term
   suppression of wheat bulb fly (Delia coarctata) populations on a
   co-ordinated whole-farm basis. A combination of novel and conventional
   control methods were employed in the study, including the use of trap
   fallows as decoy egg-laying sites (using set-aside whenever possible)
   and the selective use of insecticides targeted against adult flies at
   their emergence sites in wheat during the summer. The population control
   measures were applied on the project farm (c. 1000 ha) in Cambridgeshire
   and compared with a nearby reference farm (c. 500 ha), on which no
   population management was adopted. The area of trap fallow used each
   year ranged from 0.8 to 40.9 ha. Water traps were used to monitor adult
   fly activity during the summer and to guide the application of
   insecticides targeted against adult flies at high-risk emergence fields
   in July, before the flies dispersed to egg-laying sites. There was some
   evidence that the population control strategy adopted at the project
   farm contributed to the decline in wheat bulb fly egg numbers at this
   site. In autumn 2000, egg numbers at the project farm decreased compared
   with the previous year, whereas numbers at the reference farm and in the
   regional forecast increased. The proportion of the wheat area at risk of
   attack with egg numbers greater than the 2.5 million eggs/ha threshold
   also declined from 49\% in 1997 to 8\% on the project farm in 2000. In
   2001, there was an overall decline in egg numbers at all sites and
   although numbers on the project farm remained lower than the reference
   farm, a change in crop rotation on the project farm meant that a smaller
   area of wheat remained at risk of attack as fewer wheats were sown after
   crops such as potatoes and sugar beet. The trap fallows were not
   successful as greater numbers of eggs were laid on the soil surface
   beneath the canopy of sugar beet and potato crops and the possible
   reasons for this are discussed. The observed effects of the population
   control strategy may thus have been associated with the impact of the
   summer sprays targeted against the adult flies at their emergence sites,
   but further work is required to verify this.}},

Abstract = {{Mefenoxam is currently the only fungicide used to control pink rot, an
   important soil-borne disease of potato caused by Phytophthora
   erythroseptica. Isolates obtained from infected tubers collected
   throughout North America range widely in their responses to mefenoxam.
   Of 1168 isolates tested, 75.9\% were classified as ``sensitive{''} (S) -
   (EC50 <1.0 mug ml(-1)), 3.9\% as ``intermediate{''} (I) - (EC50 1.0 -
   99.9 mug ml(-1)) and 20.2\% as ``resistant{''} (R) - (EC50 greater than
   or equal to100 mug ml(-1)). Further studies were initiated to examine
   the frequency of resistance as it exists in soil populations of the
   pathogen and to monitor its changes in frequency distribution over time.
   In 1998, 87.9\% of the 29 isolates collected from 6 sites within a field
   known to be infested with P. erythroseptica were found to be
   mefenoxam-resistant. In 2000, isolates were recovered from 4 of the 6
   sites. All isolates recovered from sites yielding R isolates in 1998
   were resistant in 2000. The population at one site shifted from 92.3\% S
   and 7.7\% I types in 1998 to 0.0\% S, 5.0\% I, 95.0\% R in 2000.
   ``Intermediate{''} isolates represent a small proportion of the
   population. Populations developed from selfed isolates (S, I, and R)
   were non-segregating. The EC(50)s of F1s obtained from S parental
   isolates all fell into the ``sensitive{''} range with a slight shift
   toward increased sensitivity while the progeny of the R isolates were
   found to be ``resistant{''}, ranging in a normal distribution around the
   EC(50)s of the respective parental isolates. Greater variability was
   observed in the F1 populations obtained from I parental types with a
   shift toward resistance occurring in the populations collected from the
   isolates with the higher EC50 values.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding habitat selection and dispersal are crucial processes that
   affect many components of fitness. Breeding dispersal entails costs, one
   of which has been neglected: dispersing animals may miss breeding
   opportunities because breeding dispersal requires finding a new nesting
   site and mate, two time- and energy-consuming activities. Dispersers are
   expected to be prone to non-breeding. We used the kittiwake (Rissa
   tridactyla) to test whether breeding dispersal influences breeding
   probability. Breeding probability was associated with dispersal, in that
   both were negatively influenced by private information (previous
   individual reproductive success) and public information (average
   reproductive success of conspecifics) about patch quality. Furthermore,
   the probability of skipping breeding was 1.7 times higher in birds that
   settled in a new patch relative to those that remained on the same
   patch. Finally, non-breeders that resumed breeding were 4.4 times more
   likely to disperse than birds that bred in successive years. Although
   private information may influence breeding probability directly, the
   link between breeding probability and public information may be
   indirect, through the influence of public information on breeding
   dispersal, non-breeding thus being a cost of dispersal. These results
   support the hypothesis that dispersal may result in not being able to
   breed. More generally, non-breeding (which can be interpreted as an
   extreme form of breeding failure) may reveal costs of various previous
   activities. Because monitoring the non-breeding portion of a population
   is difficult, non-breeders have been neglected in many studies of
   reproduction trade-offs.}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of the leaf-feeding beetle Charidotis pygmaea Klug and
   its potential to control Lantana montevidensis (Sprengel) Briquet, a
   serious pasture weed of central and southern Queensland, Australia, were
   assessed. C. pygmaea was collected in Brazil from Lantana fucata
   Lindley, a plant morphologically similar to L. montevidensis. Over
   40,000 beetles were released over 3 years by use of caged and uncaged
   techniques at 25 sites throughout southeast and central Queensland. At 6
   of the sites where detailed and frequent monitoring occurred, no adults
   were found 6 months after the release. At another 2 sites, adults were
   present for only 12 months. Only a small number of eggs were laid at any
   single site and few larvae completed development to the adult stage. No
   signs of insect activity were found at any site after 24 months.
   Comparative laboratory and experimental field plot trials with both the
   weedy (field host) and the ornamental (glasshouse host) forms of L.
   montevidensis did not show significant differences in insect
   performance. Assessment of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and water
   contents, leaf hairiness, and leaf toughness of both the weedy and the
   ornamental forms of L. montevidensis grown under glasshouse an field
   plot conditions did not show differences between the two plant forms.
   There were, however, differences in the percentage of adults that
   developed in the glasshouse trials compared to the field plot trials
   (55\% vs 5\%). Field observations in Brazil showed that C. pygmaea was
   found only on L. fucata and L. tiliifolia Chamisso and was not seen on
   L. montevidensis growing in the same region. Climate matching with
   CLIMEX showed that most areas in Australia where L. montevidensis is a
   major problem are not climatically similar to the collection sites of C.
   pygmaea in Brazil. Whereas populations of C. pygmaea can be maintained
   on L. montevidensis under glasshouse conditions, it performs poorly on
   that species under field conditions. Unsuitable climatic conditions and
   an incompatible target plant are the most likely factors affecting the
   poor performance of C. pygmaea. Consequently, field releases of the
   agent in Australia have ceased and C. pygmaea is not recommended as a
   biological control agent for L. montevidensis in Australia. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The results reported in this paper represent work from two separate
   experiments, namely a plot trial using cattle feces conducted at
   Kungsangen in Uppsala, Sweden and a plot trial using sheep feces
   undertaken at Tastrup in Copenhagen, Denmark. In both trials, a
   technique was used to monitor the level of Duddingtonia flagrans
   propagules in soil surrounding feces. The feces were from animals fed or
   not fed D. flagrans fungal chlamydospores. Also presented are the
   numbers of soil nematodes in soil surrounding sheep feces. The results
   indicate that D. flagrans has little growth beyond the fecal environment
   into surrounding soil when chlamydospores are fed to either sheep or
   cattle. This is substantiated by the soil nematode data. No statistical
   differences in the number of nematode taxa identified, Shannon Weiner
   H', proportion of various feeding groups, and B/B + F (B and F are the
   proportions of bacterial and fungal-feeding nematodes) were found when
   soil surrounding sheep feces containing chlamydospores and parasitic
   nematode eggs was compared to soil surrounding feces containing
   parasitic nematode eggs alone. It is unlikely that the application of D.
   flagrans as a biological control agent against the free-living stages of
   nematode parasites of these livestock will negatively affect populations
   of nontarget soil nematodes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science.}},

Abstract = {{Two freshwater anguillid eel species, Anguilla australis and A.
   dieffenbachia, form the basis of important traditional, recreational,
   and commercial fisheries in New Zealand. These fisheries have been
   affected by the damming of many of the major water-ways for
   hydroelectric generation. To create fisheries in reservoirs that would
   be otherwise inaccessible, elvers have been transferred from the base of
   dams into habitats upstream. Operations in three catchments: the Patea
   River (Lake Rotorangi), Waikato River (eight reservoirs notably the two
   lowermost, lakes Karapiro and Arapuni), and Rangitaiki River (lakes
   Matahina and Aniwhenua) are discussed. In all reservoirs, the transfers
   have successfully established fishable populations within six years of
   the first transfers and, in Lake Arapuni eels have reached the
   marketable size of 220 g in less than four years. In comparison, it
   typically takes from 13 to 17 years before eel populations are fishable
   in the lower Waikato River where direct access to the sea is available.
   Telemetry and monitoring at the screens and tailraces of several power
   stations have been used to determine migration timing, triggers, and
   pathways of mature eels. Successful downstream transfer of mature
   migrating adults has been achieved by spillway opening and netting in
   headraces during rain events in autumn, but means of preventing eels
   from impinging and entraining at the intakes are still required. An
   integrated, catchment-wide management system will be required to ensure
   sustainability of the fisheries.}},

Abstract = {{In general, temperature and activity levels of fish are highly
   correlated, and this has important implications to the management of
   fish populations exposed to elevated and dynamic thermal systems due to
   anthropogenic perturbations. In this study, the behavior and physiology
   of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were monitored in the discharge
   canal of a thermal generating station on Lake Erie during two critical
   thermal periods; winter and summer. The spring transition was also
   monitored. Behavioral responses were quantified by monitoring movement,
   distribution, and abundance with traditional radio telemetry, underwater
   videography, and activity transmitters. Cardiac function was monitored
   with hard-wired Doppler flow probes to assess physiological adjustments.
   At lower temperatures during the winter and spring, smallmouth bass
   spent most of their time in the warmest and most thermally variable
   areas of the discharge canal and made few behavioral adjustments on both
   large- and fine-scales. At these times cardiac function was highly
   correlated with temperature. As temperatures increased in the summer
   this trend began to reverse with a decrease in the correlation between
   cardiac function and temperature until a critical point at approximately
   25-30degreesC where most smallmouth bass attempted to locate thermal
   refugia by leaving the untempered areas of the discharge canal. Cardiac
   function of bass experimentally forced to stay in the high and dynamic
   thermal conditions was completely independent of temperature. This work
   illustrates the variation in behavioral and physiological responses
   associated with exposure to different thermal regimes and indicates the
   utility of integrative studies in assessing the impacts of anthropogenic
   influences.}},

Abstract = {{A statewide reciprocal transplant study was initiated to compare the
   performance of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, from two different
   sources in South Carolina, the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions. South
   Carolina is located in the broad hybrid zone that exists between the
   ranges of the northern, M. s. salmoides, and Florida, M. s. floridanus,
   subspecies of largemouth bass. Allozyme surveys have shown South
   Carolina coastal largemouth bass populations possess 98 percent Florida
   alleles, whereas Piedmont populations possess as few as 36 percent
   Florida alleles. A group of 36 new or renovated farm ponds were stocked
   in 1994 and 1995 with either Coastal Plain or Piedmont strain largemouth
   bass. We characterized performance differences between the two strains
   by evaluating growth, length, and weight of original stocks, and their
   length-weight relationship at one and three years of age. Selected water
   quality parameters were monitored to define differences among ponds.
   Region (Coastal Plain or Piedmont), strain, year stocked, and all
   possible interactions were tested as predictors of growth and size at
   age. Differences between regions were significant (P less than or equal
   to 0.05) for growth, length, and weight at age-1, and for growth at
   age-3, with fish stocked in the Coastal Plain growing faster than those
   stocked in the Piedmont region. Differences due to year, strain, and the
   tested interactions, and differences in the length-weight relationships,
   were not significant.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a series of experiments to assess the real-time
   physiological and behavioral responses of largemouth bass Micropterus
   salmoides and smallmouth bass M. dolomieu to different angling related
   stressors and then monitored their recovery using both cardiac output
   devices and locomotory activity telemetry. We also review our current
   understanding of the effects of catch-and-release angling on black bass
   and provide direction for future research. Collectively our data suggest
   that all angling elicits a stress response, however, the magnitude of
   this response is determined by the degree of exhaustion and varies with
   water temperature. Our results also suggest that air exposure,
   especially following exhaustive exercise, places an additional stress on
   fish that increases the time needed for recovery and likely the
   probability of death. Simulated tournament conditions revealed that
   metabolic rates of captured fish increase with live-well densities
   greater than one individual, placing a greater demand on live-well
   oxygen conditions. The repeated handling of fish during tournament
   angling, including culling, the addition of fish or other live-well
   disturbances, and the final tournament weigh-in, which adds an
   additional several minutes of air exposure, further adds to already
   heightened stress levels. When these cumulative stressors do not result
   in death, the resultant energetic disruptions clearly have negative
   impacts not only on the short term health and condition of the fish, but
   also most likely on its biological fitness (i.e., its lifetime
   reproductive success). We also show that following angling,
   nest-guarding male bass face a reduction in their locomotory activity
   that may reduce their ability to successfully defend the nest. Although
   most concerns about catch-and-release angling occur at the population
   and community level, out assessment of various angling, handling and
   retention practices identifies ways to minimize the effects of angling
   upon individual fish and to ensure that these effects do not manifest
   themselves as problems at the population level.}},

Abstract = {{A four-year monitoring program of bass tournaments was used to describe
   smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu growth and mortality in Nova
   Scotia. Length and scale samples collected during tournament weigh-in at
   thirteen lakes and impoundments were used to summarize age, growth, and
   mortality. Scale samples were also collected from a lake not used as a
   tournament site. The conceptual requirement of a trade-off between
   growth and reproduction was the basis on which life history patterns of
   smallmouth bass were addressed. The von Bertalanffy growth model was
   used to represent this trade-off and parameters, such as asymptotic size
   and the growth coefficient, were used within the framework of life
   history invariants for inferring size at maturity. Estimates for size at
   maturity fell within known ranges for smallmouth bass after uncovering
   the life history invariant of relative size at maturity (L-mat
   /L-infinity = 0.6) for this data set. Production-to-biomass ratios (P/B)
   were determined for each population based on inferred weight at
   maturity. The mean P/B ratio for Nova Scotia smallmouth bass matched a
   P/B ratio for this species from other life history data. Instantaneous
   natural mortality rate, estimated by doubling the von Bertalanffy growth
   coefficient (M = 2 x K), closely matched estimates provided by a review
   of North American data on age and growth of smallmouth bass. Fish
   community structure appears to play a role in determining asymptotic
   size of smallmouth bass in Nova Scotia. The presence of chain pickerel
   Esox niger, as well as sites with only one other co-existing fish
   species, generally result in lower asymptotic size for smallmouth bass.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of crayfish in Europe is examined using information
   from a variety of sources mainly for the last two decades. All European
   countries have at least one indigenous crayfish species (ICS), many with
   large stocks, and most countries in Western Europe have at least one
   non-indigenous crayfish species (NICS). Some species termed indigenous
   in certain countries may have been introduced in relatively recent
   times. However, the meaning of the term indigenous (native) varies
   between countries. NICS continue to expand their ranges and present a
   continued threat to ICS through competition and transmission of
   diseases, notably crayfish plague. The current high level of interest in
   crayfish means that many countries are monitoring their crayfish
   situation and, where necessary, taking steps to renew stocks of
   threatened indigenous species, some of which are apparently on the verge
   of extinction. A more regular monitoring programme for European crayfish
   as a whole is needed if the demise of indigenous species is to be
   prevented.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1990, field surveys have been undertaken in Liguria to assess the
   distribution and status of Austropotamobius pallipes populations. In
   this region, crayfish stocks were found in three bioclimatic regions:
   Alpine, Mediterranean and Continental. Although epidemic diseases and
   invasive alien crayfish have been recorded, modifications of freshwater
   habitats have to be considered as the most significant threats to native
   crayfish stocks. Regarding management, the Regional Administration of
   Liguria proposed 18 Sites of Community Importance (SCI) containing
   crayfish populations, in the framework of the Habitats Directive
   (92/43/EEC). Since public managers need to take informed decisions in
   land-use management and conservation a numeric biodiversity map,
   composed by a georeferred database connected to a geographic information
   system (GIS), has been implemented. This regional system is composed by
   22 different layers containing all the available information about the
   location of species and habitats of conservation interest. This system
   is now routinely used by regional administrators in environmental impact
   assessment. Finally, emphasis is placed on the need of promoting
   research programmes on the long-term monitoring of crayfish populations.}},

   data from the period 1990 to 1996 shows a decrease in the number of
   catchments where the native crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes, is
   present. Conversely there has been an increase in the distribution of
   non-native species, notably Pacifastacus leniusculus, which is now more
   widely distributed than A. pallipes (according to presence within 10-km
   squares of the Ordnance Survey National Grid of England and Wales). The
   Environment Agency is the main environmental regulator in England and
   Wales, and plays a key role in gathering crayfish survey data. A
   co-ordinated programme of monitoring and reporting, ideally involving
   partner organisations, should be utilised to accurately reflect the
   changing status of crayfish in these countries. Crayfish survey data is
   currently recorded on a series of local databases within the Agency, and
   records are also stored on a national freshwater invertebrate archive
   used primarily for water quality monitoring purposes. Records generated
   by other groups and individuals are collated by the Biological Records
   Centre, with whom the Environment Agency has established links, and the
   need for a dedicated national database has been expressed by many
   workers. One area currently under development involves the National
   Biodiversity Network, a medium for sharing wildlife information via the
   internet, founded by a consortium of statutory and conservation
   organisations.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Steinsfjorden is the most important noble crayfish locality in
   Norway. The crayfish population has been monitored annually since 1979
   including data on total trapping effort, yield and population
   composition before and after the catching season.
   The harvest has ranged from 0.7-4.7 kg.ha(-1). The catch per trap night
   decreased prior to 1991 and the yield was reduced by some 50\% over the
   years 1987-1992 as compared to 1979-1986. This was due to removal of
   small crayfish, high exploitation and the establishment of dense stands
   of Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis).
   Baited traps catch a large fraction of crayfish < 95 mm total length
   minimum size. These should according to the regulations immediately be
   released into the lake. However, it is apparent from the size
   composition that release of these small crayfish was rather incomplete.
   In 1983, trap mesh size was increased from 17.5 mm to 21 mm to reduce
   the fraction of undersized crayfish in the trap catches, yet no effects
   of this increased mesh size on crayfish size distribution were observed.
   The legal season has been reduced three times during the study period.
   In 1983, the closing date was changed from 31 December to 15 September.
   In 1989 the legal season was further reduced to two weeks and finally in
   1995 to 10 days. This reduced total trap effort by 45\%. The shorter
   season allow many crayfish to moult twice instead of once between
   seasons and the fraction of large crayfish has thus increased and so has
   the catch per trap night. Canadian pondweed has established dense annual
   stands and thus has made large parts of the shallow areas unsuitable for
   crayfish, causing an overall decrease in crayfish population size and
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Scamp (Mycteroperca phenax) is a protogynous grouper that is a popular
   commercial and recreational species along the Atlantic coast of the
   southeastern United States. Scamp were sampled from the commercial and
   recreational fishery (1979-1996), and from the Marine Resource
   Monitoring Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program, a
   fishery-independent sampling program (1979-1997). Ages were determined
   from transverse sections for 2573 of the 3 142 scamp for which we had
   otoliths (82\%), and 2470 gonads were examined histologically. Data from
   all data sources were pooled, and trends between two periods, 1979-89
   and 1990-97, were examined. Median length decreased significantly from
   610 Trim TL in 1979-89 to 570 mm TL in 1990-97, although there were no
   significant differences in the median age, size at maturity, and age at
   maturity between periods. The percentage of males declined from 34\% to
   21\% for specimens >500 mm TL, although the sample size was much smaller
   during the earlier period (336 vs 1645). The percentage of scamp age 10
   and older declined from 17\% in 1979-89 to 7\% in 1990-97. Females
   spawned from late February through mid-July, with a peak during March
   through May. Fishery-independent sampling revealed that: (1) spawning
   probably occurred during the late afternoon and evening, and (2) higher
   proportions of scamp spawned around new moon and full moon. The
   relationships between batch fecundity and TL, FL, ovary-free body
   weight, and whole body weight were highly significant. Potential annual
   fecundity is indeterminate and was estimated to range from 1,3 13,000 to
   10,503,200 oocytes in specimens 445-712 mm TL. The wide ranges of size
   and age at sex transition and the temporal distribution of transitionals
   suggest that sex transition is socially mediated. The decrease in the
   percentage of males, and reduction of egg production caused by the loss
   of older, larger females from the population suggests scamp may be
   increasingly vulnerable to continued overexploitation. A spawning season
   closure on the fishery for gag may result in a further increase of the
   exploitation of scamp, requiring close monitoring of the population for
   the foreseeable future.}},

Abstract = {{The allegedly noncyclic dynamics of southern snowshoe hare (Lepus
   americanus) populations may be explained by a model invoking habitat
   fragmentation and facultative predation (the refugium model) under which
   animals dispersing from patches of preferred habitat fail to establish
   themselves because of predation by facultative carnivores. We compared
   the refugium model with a revised model invoking heavy on-site predation
   in preferred habitat as the proximal mechanism responsible for the
   stability of southern snowshoe hare populations. The survival and
   movements of hares in a fragmented habitat in central Idaho were
   monitored via radiotelemetry on 6 sites differing in habitat quality
   (indexed by understory cover) from 1998 to 2000. In support of the
   revised model, predation rates were high irrespective of cover
   availability or hare density, and predators did not kill dispersing
   animals disproportionately. Furthermore, predation was focused on small
   hares, suggesting that poor recruitment of juveniles may be the
   mechanism ultimately responsible for the damped dynamics of southern
   snowshoe hare populations. The low survival rates we measured suggest
   that the population under study was undergoing a marked decline.
   However, the observed decline, determined by comparing study-site
   population estimates, was less severe, implying that the persistence of
   local snowshoe hare populations in some areas of the species' southern
   range may be influenced by metapopulation dynamics. Specifically,
   southern snowshoe hare populations in small patches of usable habitat
   may be prevented from going extinct by the arrival of immigrants from
   similar nearby patches.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional approaches for assessing the effects of catch-and-release
   angling have focused either on hooking injury, mortality associated with
   different handling and environmental conditions, or biochemical
   indicators of short-term stress response and recovery. These
   methodologies do not permit the collection of real-time data on the
   sub-lethal effects and recovery period associated with the angling
   event, nor do they provide information on long-term fitness impacts to
   angled individuals. The advent of hard-wired, archival, and telemetered
   technologies capable of collecting information on fish location,
   locomotory activity, cardiac function, and various environmental
   parameters provides researchers with powerful methodologies for
   monitoring the response of individual fish to different stressors. These
   technologies and approaches have been used primarily with freshwater
   fishes, but they may be applicable to marine environments. Compared with
   freshwater systems, there are unquestionably some additional challenges
   due to unique characteristics of the marine habitat (e.g., depth,
   vastness, salinity) and behaviors of marine fishes (e.g., migratory
   patterns). Irrespective of the challenges, fisheries scientists must
   begin to look beyond hooking mortality as an endpoint for assessing the
   success of a catch-and-release angling program. Studies need to be
   conducted that provide real-time information on sublethal physiological
   effects, disruptions in behavior, and long-term impacts on the fitness
   (lifetime reproductive success) of released fish. Despite the fact that
   managers are usually concerned with population level effects, additional
   individual-level comprehensive studies are required before we can
   attempt to understand if and how catch-and-release angling affects
   populations.}},

Title = {{Defining smaller-scale management units to further develop the ecosystem
   approach in managing large-scale pelagic krill fisheries in Antarctica}},
Journal = {{CCAMLR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{117-131}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses the principles and approach required for developing
   small-scale management units to take account of predators' needs when
   managing the fishery for Antarctic krill. It provides a theoretical
   foundation for considering the scales of management units involving the
   integration of local populations of harvested species, foraging areas of
   predators, fishing grounds and the potential influences of the
   environment, including oceanography and metapopulation structure of the
   harvested species. The integration of these components involves two
   different types of unit: the `harvesting unit', which is at the scale of
   the metapopulation of the harvested species, and the `predator unit',
   which does not have to be a relatively self-contained ecosystem but
   should be sufficiently independent for fishing in that unit not to
   inadvertently affect predators being monitored in other units. The South
   Atlantic region (Area 48) is used to illustrate how to define predator
   units. The derived conceptual model is then used to formulate an
   approach for developing fisheries on prey species, notably krill, in
   other harvesting units. The manner in which predator units can be used
   to help the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) provide strategic
   advice on the effects of fishing is discussed. In general, the early
   acquisition of information on the distribution of local populations of
   krill and the potential foraging densities of predators from within a
   harvesting unit (i.e. abundance of predators, distribution of colonies
   and foraging range) will provide a means of circumscribing predator
   units as well as undertaking an assessment of long-term annual yield. It
   is proposed that the early development of the fishery could be
   concentrated in a small number of units in such a way that the relative
   fishing intensities in those units are equivalent, although not
   necessarily equal, to the intensity expected across all units once the
   catch limit had been reached. Other units in which fishing was not
   occurring could be monitored as well. This process could help determine
   whether or not the catch limit is likely to cause undesirable effects on
   predators in any of the predator units. In this way, it is possible to
   determine, well in advance of the catch limit being reached, whether or
   not local restrictions on harvesting are necessary, as well as the
   overall requirements for the monitoring program.}},

Abstract = {{The water quality of the Venetian lagoon, particularly with respect to
   persistent organic pollutants (particularly PCDD/Fs and PCBs) and heavy
   metals, has received much attention over the last 10 years. The area has
   a long history of industrial activity with oil refining and several
   chemical production plants around Porto Marghera. Around this industrial
   zone elevated PCDD/F and PCB concentrations have been measured in
   sediments which has aroused local concern. The Venetian population, and
   that of the surrounding area, consume several times the Italian national
   average amount of fish and shellfish. As a result, it is important that
   an understanding of the fate and behaviour of contaminants within and
   around the lagoon is achieved with particular attention being paid to
   exposure via local lagoon-derived foods. This study has involved the
   development of a mass balance model which is capable of describing the
   importance of routes of emission, the distribution of contaminants
   within compartments of the lagoon, and their ultimate fate. The model
   described in this paper represents an initial attempt to describe the
   fate and behaviour of a range of contaminants within the lagoon system.
   Its purpose is to identify areas for which we lack information and hence
   help to direct cost-effective future monitoring work. The model
   presented here divides the lagoon into six well mixed zones each with a
   bulk water column and bulk sediment compartments. Contaminants are added
   to the system via a combination of direct emission (i.e. discharge),
   freshwater inflow or via atmospheric deposition. Each zone has been
   constructed using the same layout and mass balance principles as the
   Quantitative Water Air Sediment Interaction (QWASI) lake model presented
   by Mackay and co-workers. However, the model has been modified to allow
   the calculation of the mass balance under non-steady state conditions,
   and, whilst it assumes that compartments are well mixed within a zone,
   the predicted concentration data can be used in conjunction with
   spatially variable data such as sediment organic properties. Hence, the
   model output can be displayed using Geographical Information Systems
   software alongside other spatially variable data. The initial modelling
   attempt presented in this paper has shown to be useful and warrants
   further effort to improve the physical description of the lagoon e.g.
   sediment and hydrodynamics and the need to collect more monitoring data
   to test the models predictions. In particular, there is a need to
   improve our current emission estimates for a range of persistent
   pollutants and to carry out measurements of ambient air concentrations
   and freshwater inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Due to extensive industrialization and increase in population numbers
   during the last fifty years, Kastela Bay has become one of the most
   polluted areas in the Mediterranean.
   Six years ago, the Croatian Government, in collaboration with the World
   Bank and European Bank, decided to invest approximately 150 million
   Euros in water supply and sewage systems that would address the sea
   quality issues in the whole Bay, such being the largest undertaking in
   the Adriatic, and among the largest ones in the Mediterranean.
   The separate describes the initial stages of the project named
   EKO-Kastela Bay, its structure, technical approach in addressing various
   issues, in particular those related to designing and environmental
   monitoring, as well as major implementation milestones with completion
   schedules.
   Resistance of locals concerning certain undertakings, such as submarine
   outfalls, which required special approach in engagement of professionals
   and a broader governmental management matrix, is also viewed in
   retrospect.
   Finally, the project financial flow is presented, as well as problems in
   balancing the funding sources in view of surplus loan proceedings during
   certain implementation periods.
   In conclusion, it is quite possible to protect the sea and improve its
   quality by implementation of grand-scale infrastructure projects in a
   country as developed as Croatia, but there exists a number of problems,
   from planning to funding arrangements and technical implementation in
   conjunction with the position of the population, who need to see for
   themselves the common welfare through such projects with concrete
   arguments of in situ measurements and by means of adequate modeling for
   demanding processes.}},

Abstract = {{Yucatan Peninsula Coastal ecosystems are being subjected to increasing
   anthropogenic stresses such as recreational tourism, port development,
   overfishing, aquaculture as well as population growth, which are
   affecting coastal water quality. In order to establish a base-line of
   the trophic status of different zones along the Yucatan littoral,
   several seasonal surveys were conducted between 2000 and 2001 in 12
   localities, four coastal zones, five bays or coastal lagoons and three
   ports. Water quality variables analysed were salinity, dissolved oxygen,
   transparency, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, silica and phosphorus,
   Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as well as various indexes were determined.
   Results indicate different expression of symptoms. The ports and some
   coastal lagoons are in eutrophic conditions as shown by high Chl-a
   concentrations (>20 mg/m(3)) and the levels of dissolved oxygen (<2
   mg/l), while 3 other areas with low urban development the symptoms of
   low Chl-a (<2 mg/m(-3)) and high levels of dissolved oxygen (>5 mg/l)
   suggesting oligotrophic condition. These results highlight the need for
   a comprehensive regional strategy to address this potential problem. We
   recommend a study of trophic condition together with information on
   nutrient sources and land use as a tool to provide a basis for setting
   regional priorities for management, monitoring and research.}},

   Dull's sheep by muskoxen during the summer season. Disruption of
   contemporary ecological isolating barriers can result from
   anthropogenically or climatologically driven habitat perturbation, and
   result from management practices that influence the distribution of
   ungulate hosts. Thus, if zones of contact become more extensive or the
   temporal limits on allopatry are relaxed, we may observe increasing
   instances of host switching by parasites or pathogens at the interface
   of newly emerging ecotones. Impacts to northern systems linked to
   climatologically and anthropogenically driven global change and the
   effects of management must be tracked within the context of biodiversity
   survey and inventory and archival collections, as foundations for
   monitoring ecosystem-level perturbations. A developing interface for
   muskoxen, wild sheep, and parasites along the Mackenzie River ecotone
   represents a natural model or Field laboratory to examine these
   processes. Additonally, lungworms, Protostrongylus spp., had not been
   reported in muskoxen, and a new geographic record for this nematode was
   established in Dall's sheep from the northern Richardson Mountains, NT.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic monitoring of reintroduced plant populations can allow
   assessment of the success in establishing new populations that
   genetically resemble native populations. We used a PCR-based method
   (Intersimple Sequence Repeats) to quantify genetic variation in four
   reintroduced populations of Abronia umbellata ssp. breviflora, an annual
   forb native to the Pacific Coast that is state-listed endangered in
   Oregon. The reintroduced populations ranged in size from 18 to 4, 111
   individuals in the year they were sampled. Genetic variation was also
   quantified in the natural population that served as the seed source for
   the reintroduction efforts. A total of 77 loci (bands) was observed
   using two ISSR primers, providing 65 polymorphic loci. A significant,
   positive regression was observed between the log of population size for
   the five populations and genetic variation when measured as percent
   polymorphic loci (P), expected heterozygosity (H-e), and with a
   dissimilarity index (1 - S-xy) based on band sharing. Two of the
   reintroduced populations maintained approximately 90\% of the genetic
   variation we observed in the source population. Based on these results,
   we predict that reintroduced populations of A. u. ssp. breviflora that
   have at least 1, 000 individuals should maintain 90\% of the genetic
   variation of the source population.}},

Abstract = {{Russian scientists attempted to introduce the red king crab
   (Paralithodes camtschaticus) to the Barents Sea in the 1930s, but
   successful transplantation was not carried out until 1960-1970. About
   1.5 million larvae and 13,800 juveniles and adults were released in Kola
   Bay near Murmansk. From the mid-1970s, king crabs were occasionally
   recorded as bycatch in Russian and Norwegian coastal fisheries. However,
   in the early 1990s, a high abundance of crabs caused problems for
   coastal net fisheries in the Norwegian Varangerfjord, and the result was
   that a joint Russian-Norwegian red king crab research program was
   initiated. In 1994, information from local divers motivated a diver
   survey in shallow waters near Kirkenes in Varangerfjord; mating crabs
   were observed and recorded by underwater video. This documentation, and
   the occurrence of abundant. berried females and juvenile crabs in the
   fjord system, indicated successful reproduction was occurring in the
   area. Twenty-four juvenile crabs (83-101 mm carapace width) were caught
   and transported to Bergen, where they were kept under quarantine
   conditions. They were tagged individually by various methods and held in
   tanks, and tag loss was monitored through molting. Individual growth was
   also recorded. Genetic aspects were considered important and 195 white
   muscle samples were collected and analyzed for allozyme variation. There
   was a low level of genetic variation, suggesting ``bottlenecking,{''}
   which should be compared with the donor population from the Pacific
   Ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Male and female golden king crabs (Lithodes aequispinus) were collected
   with commercial crab pots in Frederick Sound, a commercial fishing area
   in southeastern Alaska, and sonic tags were attached to the carapace of
   26 crabs. Tagged crabs were either returned to their collection site or
   translocated to different depths. Crab movements were monitored May
   12-19 with a manned submersible and surface vessels and July 5-8,
   September 29-October 1 and November 7-11, 2000, with a surface vessel.
   Depth distribution, dispersal, and associations with conspecifics were
   analyzed. Substrate type and habitat with which the crabs were
   associated were videotaped and described; most crabs were in boulder or
   cobble areas, or on or near vertical walls. Sexes of crabs may have been
   segregated by depth during our sampling periods and all successfully
   tagged crabs dispersed from their release site with time. The greatest
   distance traveled from May to November was 17.5 km, with an average
   distance traveled of 11.5 km for all successfully tagged crabs. Our
   observations of 17 pairs of crabs in premating embraces between May 12
   and 19 suggests that mid-May is a time in which reproductive activity
   takes place in this population. Trends in movement from shallow to
   deeper water, from May 12 (capture and release) until November 11 (final
   relocation date), were observed for sonically tagged crabs.}},

Abstract = {{From a relatively simple start, T-DNA tagging has emerged to become an
   important tool in plant physiology and molecular biology. Initially, it
   was primarily used as a means of gene isolation. A T-DNA insertion might
   result in an obvious, changed phenotype in the host plant and the
   sequence of the tag provided a landmark allowing its isolation along
   with the mutated gene. However, more recently, with plant genome
   sequences becoming available along with transgenic plant populations
   where collectively T-DNA insertions may saturate the genome, T-DNA
   insertion is being used increasingly to determine gene function. A
   variety of T-DNA gene tags are available. Many integrate within
   transcriptional units so that promoters, enhancers, exons, and introns
   can be tagged. In such cases if the tag contains marker genes endogenous
   patterns of expression of tagged sequences can be monitored. Tags
   containing transcriptional enhancers can be used to create gain of
   function mutations by the activation of gene expression. In the
   foreseeable future we can anticipate that with the model plant
   Arabidopsis libraries will become available where accessions will
   represent the knockout and/or activation of every gene coding region as
   defined by sequencing. Increasingly, T-DNA tagging is also being used to
   characterize genes in other plant species. Thus, it may be anticipated
   that this method of gene tagging will play an important role in
   investigating gene function in plant developmental processes that are
   not easily accessible with Arabidopsis.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal plains are found on all continents, and are regional features
   bounded on the continental side by highlands and on the seaward side by
   a coastline. Many urban settlements are located on coastal plains, and
   many of these rely on underlying groundwater for water supplies.
   Saltwater intrusion (the invasion of freshwater by saltwater from the
   sea or from marine deposits due to groundwater withdrawal) threatens
   groundwater supplies in many such areas. The encroachment of saltwater
   into freshwater supplies has become a cause for concern over the last
   century as populations in coastal areas have risen sharply and placed
   greater demands on fresh groundwater reserves. Saltwater intrusion
   causes many problems in these areas, perhaps the most severe being the
   limitation of potable drinking water. This critical problem requires
   appropriate management solutions. Four basic components are necessary:
   investigation, monitoring, modelling, and control and prevention. These
   four tasks must be integrated within a cost-effective framework. Such an
   approach should facilitate the sustainable utilisation of groundwater
   resources in coastal urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{The dramatic changes in the human and animal populations in Africa over
   the last century demand the re-examination of priorities and policies.
   The introduction of developed medical and other human technologies into
   the continent has contributed to increases in population and a rapid,
   unsustainable increase in the utilization of resources. This in turn has
   led to the destruction of flora and fauna on an unprecedented scale with
   little real improvement in the human condition. One factor in this has
   been the increase in livestock in line with human demographic growth, as
   it is a traditional livelihood of many African peoples. In recent years
   the growth in livestock populations has slowed owing to a cycle of
   degradation and disease, affecting especially traditional pastoral
   systems with a close physical association between people, livestock, and
   wild animals. Pathogens benefit hugely from the dynamic state created by
   animal migration, although to some extent the livestock and certainly
   wildlife show considerable tolerance to this. One of the grave economic
   consequences of this increase in disease has been collapse of the export
   trade. In order for Africa to fully benefit and share in world trade,
   the zoosanitary situation must show improvement. To do this without
   destroying the natural resource base and traditional pastoral systems,
   will require a careful, future-oriented land-use policy along
   ecologically sound criteria. Export livestock will have to be maintained
   in areas, probably free of ruminant wildlife, with strict veterinary
   controls. If this can be balanced with sufficient areas retained for
   traditional pastoralism and wildlife, with perhaps the main income from
   recreational tourism and local consumption, the benefits will be
   considerable. The answer may be community-based, low-cost, decentralized
   health systems for pastoral communities, with less stringent sanitary
   mandates, a private/parastatal sector servicing, with specialization in
   wildlife, dairy or export livestock and a central veterinary policy,
   related to surveillance and monitoring using small well-resourced
   professional teams to carry out regulatory and statutory duties.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the mid-continent population of lesser snow geese has
   increased at about 7\% per year and increased numbers of geese have
   adversely affected the vegetation of intertidal communities on the
   shores of Hudson and James Bays. A quantitative description of plant
   communities was undertaken before they are modified or lost as a result
   of the direct and indirect effects of goose foraging. The region is
   undergoing isostatic uplift and salt marshes have developed on the
   extended, elevation shorelines. The site chosen for the study was La
   Perouse Bay, Manitoba. where there is a breeding colony of lesser snow
   geese. The plant assemblages recognised in intertidal zone, based on the
   use of Canonical Correspondence Analysis. were the Puccinellia-Carex
   community, the Festuca-Calamagrostis community (both of which were
   grazed and grubbed by geese), bare sediment. and the
   Hippuris-Myriophyllum assemblage characteristic of brackish aquatic
   habitats rarely grazed by geese), The communities were primarily
   differentiated in terms of elevation, water depth, and area of plant
   cover. These communities are widespread elsewhere in intertidal areas
   adjacent to the Hudson Bay lowlands, but intensive goose foraging has
   led either to their loss or to fine-scale fragmentation with little
   likelihood of revegetation in the foreseeable future, This description
   of vegetation serves as a baseline against which further changes can be
   monitored and assessed.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, increasing numbers of Lesser Snow Geese have severely
   damaged the sub-arctic coastal marshes on which they feed in summer.
   Because the geese are an economic, aesthetic and visible species, plans
   for population control via increased harvest are controversial, and
   accurate vegetation maps are needed both for management decision-making
   and for public education. Documentation of the extent, pattern, and
   timing of habitat damage over large spatial and temporal scales requires
   reconstruction of the previously-existing vegetation. Satellite imagery
   is increasingly used for mapping and monitoring vegetation change over
   large areas, and archives of Landsat imagery provide consistent,
   spatially-extensive historical data. Previously-existing vegetation at
   La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, was mapped using unsupervised classification
   of a 1984 Landsat TM image and ancillary information. Using a commercial
   clustering algorithm, sixty-three spectral clusters were produced and
   subsequently identified using a combination of historical and current
   aerial photos, current vegetation data, and knowledge of local
   vegetation trajectories in time. These initial clusters were then
   aggregated into 14 classes, resulting in a detailed map of vegetation as
   it was before degradation by the geese. The map was compared to earlier
   results documenting change in the study area. Vegetation degradation
   between 1973 and 1993 occurred earliest and most extensively in the salt
   marsh and other classes containing salt marsh vegetation. Map accuracy
   was assessed with current vegetation data collected independently at a
   number of precisely located points.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity of the organochlorine pesticide endosulfan to
   macroinvertebrate communities was tested using a system of 24 artificial
   streams. Macroinvertebrate communities in the streams were exposed to a
   range of endosulfan concentrations for a 12-h period and then monitored
   for 96 h. Endosulfan was prebound to fine river sediment and applied to
   the streams as a contaminated sediment slurry. This did not cause
   changes in the structure of benthic communities; however, significant
   changes (P<0.05) in the abundance of several macroinvertebrate taxa in
   drift were detected in the streams receiving the highest (6.14mug/L)
   dose. Increased drift may have implications for recolonization processes
   in lowland rivers, and, as such, pulses of contaminated sediment are
   likely to result in significant effects on macroinvertebrate populations
   and communities. This study highlights the utility of artificial stream
   systems for detecting sublethal effects and the need for population and
   community-level endpoints to be included in such studies. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The research was aimed to analyse production and morphometric parameters
   of the species Fragaria vesca in natural and managed beech forest stands
   in the Kremnicke vrchy Mts in connection with the climatic factors
   during the years 1994-1995. The obtained results represent a view on the
   biomass dynamics, on the population size structure and on the phenology
   of the observed species. Analytical models that represent weight and
   length increments creation depending on the time have been designed
   based on a non-linear trend function. Determination coefficients of the
   given time series confirmed the fact that on the individual monitoring
   plots 80-93\% amounts of the individual plants weight and length
   variability were due to the time variable. The results show that the
   number of individual plants in the managed beech stand increased in
   average 3.5 times compared with the non managed (control) plot. During
   the years under study the average weight as well as shoot length of
   individual plants were higher on the control monitoring plot. The
   remarkably highest primary production (13.02 g.m(-2).y(-1)) has been
   found in the managed stand. Phenological observation confirmed full
   vitality of species (in relation to vegetative and generative cycle) on

Abstract = {{This study investigated the activity budgets of eight species of
   waterfowl on a waste-stabilisation pond known to support a large
   waterfowl community. Most species examined were found to use the area
   extensively for feeding. Pink-eared Duck (Malacorhynchus membranaceus),
   Australasian Shoveler (Anal rhynchotis), Grey Teal (A. gibberifrons) and
   Chestnut Teal (A. castanea) fed most intensively at sunrise and sunset,
   and rested during the middle of the day. Hardhead (Aythya australis), a
   diving species, Australian Shelduck (Tadorna tadornoides) and Pacific
   Black Duck (Anas superciliosa) - large birds that were presumably able
   to reach the benthos from the water's surface - fed at relatively
   consistent levels throughout the day. Black Swans (Cygnus atratus)
   steadily increased the amount of time spent feeding from dawn to dusk.
   The diurnal activity budgets of these Australian species were similar to
   those observed for other species occupying similar ecological niches
   elsewhere. Imminent changes to sewage treatment operations may reduce
   the ability of this waste-stabilisation pond to support waterfowl
   populations. The monitoring of activity budgets after any such changes
   are implemented should be an effective means of detecting any effects,
   negative or positive.}},

Abstract = {{Botanicals are crude vegetable medicinals, including roots, leaves,
   bark, or other plant materials used to produce pharmaceuticals, herbal
   supplements, and other products. Dried botanicals often become infested
   with insects and mites during storage, but little is known about these
   infestations. The objective of the present study was to characterize an
   infestation of stored botanicals by the Indianmeal moth, Plodia
   interpunctella, and the tobacco moth, Ephestia elutella, in a North
   Carolina warehouse. The moth populations were monitored for one year
   with an array of pheromone-baited sticky traps. Spatial analysis of
   numbers captured showed broadly overlapping, but distinct distributions,
   suggesting that both species prefer roots but that P, interpunctella has
   a broader host range. Seasonal variation in rates of capture reflected
   the effect of temperature cycles on population growth and flight
   activity, and suggested that E. elutella populations may suffer less
   winter mortality or may recover more quickly than P. interpunctella.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to motor vehicle emissions represents an important concern for
   possible long-term health effects. The present report describes: 1) the
   application and verification of the alkaline comet assay in Ctenomys
   minutus to detect the possible genotoxicity of automobile emissions; 2)
   a comparison of the comet assay results with peripheral blood
   micronucleus (MN) assay results performed in the same animals; and 3)
   the identification of agents involved in the responses and in the
   seasonal variation of the effects. Ctenomys minutus
   (Octodontidae-Rodentia) were captured in two different fields from both
   sides of RS/030, a highway on the coastal plain of the Brazilian state
   of Rio Grande do Sul. Reference animals were obtained from a nearby
   field that was about 3 km distant from any road. By the end of this
   study, 123 rodents (73 females and 50 males) were live-trapped. Our
   results indicate that there was an increase in cells with DNA damage for
   C. minutus environmentally exposed to automobile emissions, as
   demonstrated by the alkaline comet assay, but there was no increase in
   micronucleated cells. The alkaline comet assay showed age and gender
   differences in the response. The comet assay results suggest that adult
   females are the principal population affected by air pollutants from
   vehicle emissions. Chemical data were also collected from areas exposed
   to automobile exhaust and these indicated that elevated levels of
   hydrocarbons, metals, and NO2 were associated with the elevated levels
   of damaged cells observed in the wild rodent C. minutus. Our results
   agree with previous data on engine and fuel components, where weak
   increases in damage for native rodents exposed to emissions have been
   observed. Other larger, controlled studies are needed to better
   understand how the metabolism of C. minutus affects its response to
   emission exposure. Environ. Mal. Mutagen. 40:227-235, 2002. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Environmental pollution is one of the major problems being faced today
   due to the advent of extensive industrialization. Heavy metals are the
   most important contaminants in wastewater that are present in abundance
   and are toxic. Heavy metal contents of sewage in the industrial estate
   of Aligarh (U.P.) have been determined by atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry. The analysis of samples collected from six different
   locations revealed significantly high levels of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni.
   Certain bacteriological (Total bacterial count, Total coliform, Fecal
   coliform, and Fecal Streptococci) parameters of domestic and industrial
   sewage as well as soils were monitored from March 1990 to January 1993.
   Total bacterial count, total coliform, fecal coliform and fecal
   streptococci were found to be lowest in all the samples of industrial
   wastewater compared to those in domestic sewage and soil systems. The
   soil however, contained highest total culturable bacterial population.
   In view of the common practice of the application of sewage to
   agricultural land in the neighbouring area, the discharge of industrial
   wastewater without proper treatment into public sewers should be
   strictly prohibited.}},

Abstract = {{The biological effects of contaminants in British estuaries and coastal
   waters have been studied for over 100 years. Until the 1970s, the major
   pollution impact on estuarine organisms was probably caused by poorly
   treated sewage which led to severe oxygen deficits and consequent
   asphyxiation of many water-breathers. However, since the introduction of
   improved sewage treatment in the last 30 years, a number of continuing
   impacts have come to light which represent true toxic effects of
   micro-contaminants. Sublethal changes observed in various bioassays and
   biomarkers are widespread in both fish and invertebrates, and in the
   most urbanised and industrialised estuaries, these effects are probably
   having impacts at the population and community levels. For example,
   there is good evidence to show that tributyltin from some antifouling
   paints has not only affected the sexuality and reproductive success of
   individual estuarine and coastal molluscs, but has also damaged some
   benthic communities of which molluscs are but a part. Although there are
   data to show that some contaminant concentrations are now declining, we
   do not yet have enough data in most cases to decide whether organisms
   have also begun to recover. This paper reviews the entire field of
   contaminant effects in UK estuarine and marine waters, focusing
   especially on the years 1985 2000, and makes some recommendations for
   future research and monitoring programmes. Published by Elsevier Science
   Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The relative influence of limnological confounding factors on cadmium
   (Cd) bioaccumulation and metallothionein (NIT) synthesis was quantified
   in natural populations of freshwater bivalves (Pyganodon grandis) living
   in lakes along a Cd concentration gradient. During the ice-free period,
   we measured 15 environmental variables in the water compartment and
   determined total concentrations of Cd and MT in the gills of bivalves at
   37 littoral stations in 20 lakes distributed across the mining area of
   Rouyn-Noranda in northwestern Quebec. A multiple linear regression model
   including pH ( +), dissolved Ca concentrations (-) and free Cd 2 1
   concentrations at the sediment -water interface ( +) explained 74\% of
   the variability in Cd concentrations in the bivalve gills. Dissolved Ca
   (-) and free Cd2+ ( +) together explained 62\% of the variation in MT
   concentrations in the bivalve gills. Partial linear regression analyses
   indicated that the limnological factors' pure and shared effects
   together accounted for 48 and 45\% of the total variation in Cd and NIT
   concentrations in the gills, respectively. A lake selection procedure
   that could be applied in monitoring programs is proposed to minimise the
   relative influence of these confounding variables. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {{The Belgian PCB/dioxin incident: Analysis of the food chain
   contamination and health risk evaluation}},

Pages = {{1-18}},

Abstract = {{The Belgian PCB incident occurred at the end of January 1999 when a
   mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contaminated with dioxins
   was accidentally added to a stock of recycled fat used in the production
   of animal feeds. Although signs of poultry poisoning were noticed by
   February, 1999, the source and the extent of the contamination were
   discovered only in May 1999, when it appeared that more than 2500 farms
   could have been supplied with contaminated feeds. This resulted in a
   major food crisis, which rapidly extended to the whole country and could
   be resolved only by the implementation of a large PCB/dioxin food
   monitoring program. Screening for PCB contamination was based on the
   determination of the seven PCB markers. When PCB concentrations exceeded
   the tolerance levels of 0.1 (milk), 0.2 (poultry, bovine, and pig meat),
   or 1 (animal feed) mug/g fat, dioxins (17 PCDD/Fs congeners) were also
   determined. At the end of December 1999, the database contained the
   results of more than 55,000 PCB and 500 dioxin analyses. The study of
   PCB levels and profiles in contaminated feeds delivered to poultry or
   pig farms confirmed that the Belgian PCB incident was due to a single
   source of PCB oil introduced into the food chain at the end of January
   1999. This PCB oil had a congeners pattern closely matched to a mixture
   of Aroclor 1260/1254 in the proportion 75/25. The total amount of PCBs
   added to recycled fats was estimated at 50 kg (sum of the seven markers)
   or approximately 150 kg total PCBs, which corresponds to about 100
   liters of PCB oil. This PCB mixture contained about 1 g TEQ dioxins
   (more than 90\% contributed by PCDFs) and about 2 g TEQ dioxin-like
   PCBs. The proportions of PCB 52 and 101 congeners were fairly constant
   in animal feeds, excluding the possibility of secondary contamination
   due to fat recycling from contaminated animals. The highest
   concentrations of PCBs and dioxins were found in poultry and especially
   in the reproduction animals (hens and chicks), which showed the
   classical manifestations of chick edema disease. The pigs were also
   affected but to a lesser extent and no sign of intoxication was
   observed. The study of PCB/dioxin patterns and of the PCB: dioxin ratios
   revealed major differences in the metabolism of these compounds by farm
   animals. Whereas the PCBs: dioxins ratio was fairly constant in all
   poultry products with a mean value similar to that found in contaminated
   feeds (50,000), in pigs this ratio was both much higher and more
   variable (values up to 10,000,000), reflecting a faster elimination of
   dioxins than PCBs in these animals. These metabolic differences also
   emerged from the PCB and dioxin patterns which were altered much more in
   pigs than in poultry. Although the most contaminated food products
   (chicken meat) had PCB and dioxin levels more than 100 times above
   maximal recommended values, it is unlikely that this incident could have
   caused adverse effects in the general population of Belgium. A doubling
   of the PCB and dioxin burden of the young adult population would require
   the consumption of, respectively, 10 and 20 highly contaminated meals.
   In view of the very limited proportion of the poultry chain effectively
   contaminated during the incident (around 2\%), such an extreme scenario
   was quite improbable for the general population except perhaps for
   farmers consuming their own products. But even in that case, it would
   have meant going back to the levels in the 1980s or attaining the body
   burden of subjects regularly eating contaminated seafood. (C) 2002

Pages = {{169-174}},
Abstract = {{A combined monitoring and dispersion modelling methodology was applied
   for assessing air quality at three different levels of proximity to the
   selected service station: (I) next to the fuel pumps, (II) in the
   surrounding environment, and (III) in the background. Continuous
   monitoring and passive sampling were used for achieving high temporal
   and spatial resolution, respectively. A Gaussian dispersion model
   (CALINE4) was used for assessing the road traffic contribution to the
   local concentrations under different meteorological conditions.
   It was established that Stage 2 vapour recovery reduces BTX
   concentrations not only near the pumps, but also in their surrounding
   environment. However, there is evidence that the efficiency of the
   system is wind speed dependent. The modelling simulation of the worst
   case wind scenario revealed the significance of local traffic emissions.
   It was shown that the traffic contribution even from a single road in
   the vicinity of the station can, under certain conditions, be higher
   than the contribution of the station itself to the local BTX levels.
   Finally, after comparison with previous studies, the concentrations
   measured near the service station (which was situated in a rural
   environment) appear to be lower than those observed in busy street
   canyons in city centres.
   It can be concluded, although Stage 2 recovery system effectively
   reduces working VOC losses in service stations, that it will only have a
   limited positive impact on local air quality if the service station is
   located in a heavily polluted area.}},

Abstract = {{During the last 30 years, the increase of the human population in the
   Amazon introduced the need for additional food production and caused the
   state government to implement programs to increase and improve
   agricultural production. The production of nontraditional crops
   introduced several problems unknown to traditional farmers, since they
   are not well adapted to tropical conditions. Their susceptibility to
   insects, fungi and other plagues, and the competition with native
   vegetation forced farmers to use pesticides intensively. Amazonian
   farmers were not adequately prepared for the use of this new technology;
   they ignored the risk of pesticides to human health and the environment.
   Using the region of the state capital Manaus as an example, the
   characteristics of the pesticide use are described (e.g. the increased
   use and the lack of personal protective equipment, as well as the legal
   situation). In detail, the registration status of pesticides used in the
   State of Amazonas and the state of their registration in the European
   Union is compared. Finally, it is concluded that the use and the fate of
   pesticides in the Amazon region has to be monitored. Data of the effects
   on humans and on the environment have to be collected from the
   literature or have to be produced in standardized tests, so that an
   environmental risk assessment becomes possible. Training and information
   programs are urgently needed in order to build up environmentally
   sustainable agriculture. Finally, the enforcement of Brazilian laws
   concerning pesticide registration has to be improved.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Negative interaction between individuals is a distinctive feature of
   populations. The question is addressed whether the population response
   to toxicants (e.g., the pyrethroid pesticide fenvalerate) is altered by
   the strength of negative intraspecific interaction. Larvae of the
   trichopteran Limnephilus lunatus Curtis were exposed for 1 h to
   fenvalerate, then larval survival and adult emergence were monitored in
   outdoor stream microcosms over eight months. Degree of interaction was
   varied by changing larval densities. No survival was observed after 15 d
   at 100 mug/L. Survival decreased slightly at 10 mug/L when strong
   interaction was present. Survival in the range of 0.001 to 1 mug/L was
   similar to that in the control, regardless of the strength of
   interaction. In contrast. chronic effects differed widely according to
   the degree of interaction, Weak interaction resulted in high survival of
   controls, a lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) (mortality) of
   0.1 mug/L, a delay in development at 0.001 to 0.01 mug/L, and reduced
   weight of adults from 0.01 mug/L on. Strong interaction resulted in low
   survival of controls, a LOEC (mortality) of 100 mug/L, and a delay in
   development at 0.1 mug/L. The suggestion Aas made that these differences
   in chronic effects are caused by a toxicant-induced reduction of
   negative intraspecific interaction at high concentrations (greater than
   or equal to1 mug/L). Hence, direct effects of the toxicant are partly
   compensated because of indirect reduction of negative interaction
   compared to the control. Interaction is not decreased at low
   concentrations (less than or equal to0.1 mug/L) and, thus, effects of
   the toxicant are not compensated, Accordingly, the response to toxicants
   at the population level when negative interaction is present differs
   from the response at individual level.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{387-397}},
Abstract = {{The ideal free distribution assumes that habitat selection is without
   cost and predicts that fitness should be equal in different habitats. If
   habitat selection has a cost, then individuals should only move to
   another habitat when potential fitness in the new habitat exceeds that
   in the source habitat by an amount greater than the cost of habitat
   selection. We used isodar techniques to assess the cost of habitat
   selection. In an experimental landscape, we monitored density, movement,
   and reproductive success of adult female prairie voles, Microtus
   ochrogaster, in adjacent paired habitats with low and high cover. We
   tested the following hypotheses: (1) adult female prairie voles
   exhibited density-dependent habitat selection; (2) the cost of habitat
   selection was density-independent. Habitat quality based on population
   density and fitness of adult females was higher in high cover habitats.
   Net movement was from low cover to high cover habitats. The results
   indicated that adult female prairie voles exhibited density-dependent
   habitat selection. Furthermore, there was a significant cost of habitat
   selection, and the cost was density-independent.}},

   legumes and/or their residues. Nothrus in particular increased in
   abundance more than any other taxon in the presence of residues of A.
   pintoi. Each legume supported a unique oribatid mite community in terms
   of species composition and relative abundance. The large numbers of
   Archegozetes trapped from all the legume and grass plots in April and
   November 1998 were also attributed to highly conducive conditions
   provided by the vegetation cover and their residues. The results suggest
   that the oribatid mite community of the study area was numerically
   stable as the peak populations of different species were not
   synchronized. Many taxonomic groups of pycnonotic brachypyline mites
   were absent. Legume cover crops, especially A. pintoi, and their
   residues have potential in restoring oribatid mite populations to
   precultivation levels.}},

Abstract = {{The Ems-Dollard estuary, situated in the north of the Netherlands near
   to the German border, is covered for a large part by intertidal flats,
   Currents and wind- induced waves exert a shear stress on these flats,
   resulting in resuspension of the sediment. Fluctuations of the suspended
   sediment concentration in the Dollard are strongly affected by erosion
   due to wind-induced waves and by settling during calm weather
   conditions. However it is believed that benthic processes influence the
   amount of sediment that can be resuspended from the intertidal flats.
   Therefore suspended sediment concentration above the Heringsplaat, an
   intertidal flat in the Ems-Dollard estuary, was measured during two
   seasons and related to the dominant benthic biological features. The
   benthos and the abiotic sediment characteristics were monitored from
   1995 till 1997, at two stations. At both stations a peak of
   chlorophyll-a concentration was found in spring, caused by a diatom
   bloom. Meiobenthos was dominated by nematodes, macrobenthos by the
   polychaete Marenzelleria viridis and the amphipod Corophium volutator.
   The seasonal pattern was studied most intensively during 1996. Monthly
   sampling was done on the Heringsplaat, The flat was covered with ice
   during March. This period was followed by a clear water phase during
   spring and an increase of the silt content at the edge of the
   Heringsplaat. During this period an increase was found of chlorophyll-a
   concentration and of the carbohydrate concentration. This carbohydrate
   secretion stabilized the sediment. This finally resulted in a stable
   diatom mat at the end of the spring and a two-centimeter thick layer of
   silt. During June a high increase of nematodes and Corophium volutator
   was found. Nematode density was about 5000 ind per 10 cm 2 during June
   and July and Corophium density reached almost 100,000 per m(2). The
   diatom population decreased rapidly during June. It is assumed that this
   is caused by high grazing pressure of the nematodes and of Corophium.
   The reduced diatom concentration and the increased bioturbation activity
   of Corophium resulted in reduced sediment stability. The silt content of
   the sediment surface at the edge of the Heringsplaat reduced and at the
   same time the turbidity in the water column increased.}},

Abstract = {{This is a synthesis of published and unpublished research on euphausiid
   and fish populations using the south-west coast of Vancouver Island.
   Overall, the studies covered 1985-98, when there were two ENSO events
   and considerable variation in upwelling. The population biology of the
   dominant euphausiids (Thysanoessa spinifera, Euphausia pacifica) was
   monitored during 1991-98. The species abundance trends differed. Results
   of simple correlation analyses suggested that variations in temperature,
   salinity and upwelling do not explain variations in the abundance of
   larval or adult euphausiids, or in the abundance of portions of
   euphausiid populations on which fish feed. I found significant
   interannual variations in daily ration of the dominant planktivorous
   fish species, but euphausiids remained the most important prey. Pacific
   hake (Merluccius productus), the dominant planktivore, fed on larger
   (>17 mm) T. spinifera, even though the biomass of this part of the
   euphausiid biomass decreased by 75\% between 1991 and 1997, but Pacific
   herring (Clupea pallasi) may have begun feeding on smaller E. pacifica.
   Therefore, any study of the relationship between fish production and
   krill biology must consider that part of the euphausiid biomass
   exploited by fish. In addition, some fish species and/or life history
   stages appeared to adapt to changes in euphausiid availability, while
   others did not. Such variation in adaptations also has to be described
   and considered to understand how changes in euphausiid biology affect
   fish productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The sock abundance of the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio has been
   estimated based on trawl and pot surveys in Japan. However, the gear
   efficiency has not been sufficiently measured. As a direct observation
   method to estimate the population density of the snow crab, the Deep-sea
   Video Monitoring System on a Towed Sledge (DVMSTS) was developed and its
   effectiveness was demonstrated in field observations. To improve the
   accuracy of the crab population density estimated from the amount of
   crab catches obtained by the survey pot, the Effective Fishing Area Per
   Survey Pot (EFAPSP) was estimated using the DVMSTS. The observations by
   DVMSTS and pots fishing operations were performed 18 times in total off
   the Old Islands in the Sea of Japan in April to May, 2000. The EFAPSP
   was estimated to be approximately 1,600 m(2)/ pot. The DVMSTS can be
   utilized for not only estimation of the population density but also
   calibration of the gear efficiency for the snow crab.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in aquatic environmental factors and sedimentation
   fluxes were monitored monthly for more than ten years in Ofunato
   estuary, Japan. In order to make an effective use of these data, a
   system including both database and visualization subsystems was
   developed, enabling data search and the drawing of color contour maps of
   the data on the Internet. It was shown that depletion of dissolved
   oxygen near the bottom in summer was attributed to heavy biodeposition
   of organic matters from upper layers and little exchange of seawater in
   strongly stratified bottom layers. By using a population dynamics model
   for the Japanese oyster, biodeposits from mariculture rafts were
   estimated. This model gave predictions of biodeposits in agreement with
   monitored seasonal changes in sedimentation fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{To search for genes that are expressed during population growth of the
   rotifer Brachionus plicatilis in a phase-dependent manner, we carried
   out mRNA arbitrarily primed reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction (RAP RT-PCR). Total RNAs were extracted from the population
   exponentially growing (day 10) and that in a stationary phase (day 15).
   cDNAs were synthesized with each of five random primers contained in RAP
   RT-PCR kit, and fingerprinting patterns were compared between the
   populations on days 10 and 15. One gene from five candidates
   differentially expressed was successfully cloned, and its DNA nucleotide
   sequence of 444 bp was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of
   130 residues showed 57-82\% identity with those of clathrin heavy chain
   genes from various organisms including yeast and human. Northern blot
   analysis revealed that the accumulated mRNA levels were significantly
   higher in exponential than stationary phase. Thus, it seems possible to
   use expression patterns of the clathrin gene for monitoring the growth
   status of rotifer populations.}},

Abstract = {{Diameter-limit harvesting is a commonly-used forest harvesting technique
   among landowners in West Virginia as opposed to silviculturally-accepted
   systems such as clearcutting, single-tree selection, and two-age
   harvesting. Songbird species respond both negatively and positively to
   these systems, and ornithologists suggest these techniques can be used
   when managing for songbirds at the stand and landscape levels. However,
   little is known about the effects of diameter-limit harvesting an
   songbird abundances and their reproductive success. We evaluated the
   effects of this technique on songbird populations at the Westvaco
   Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest (WWERF) in the Allegheny
   Mountains of West Virginia. The area is an industrial forest composed
   predominantly of Appalachian hardwoods 60-80 years old. We examined
   songbird abundances throughout the forest and nesting success on four 40
   ha plots in 1996. In 1997, two plots were harvested using (lie
   diameter-limit technique where most trees greater than or equal to45.7
   cm were removed. Abundance and nesting success were monitored again in
   1997 and 1998. Results indicate that the abundances of most songbird
   species present prior to harvest changed little after the timber
   removal. Two species, the Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis) and
   dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), were more abundant in harvested areas
   than unharvested forest. One habitat group, interior/edge species, and
   total abundance of songbirds also had higher abundance in harvested
   areas. Overall nest survival in harvested areas was higher both 1-
   (37.7\%) and 2-years (46.4\%) after harvesting than before harvesting
   (14.9\%). Only large-diameter trees were removed on the WWERF, and
   intermediate and subcanopy trees remained standing, retaining
   considerable structural heterogeneity. Stands that were harvested
   differed from unharvested stands by having more snags, higher density of
   trees greater than or equal to8-14.9 cm, and a higher percent cover of
   down wood, Canopy cover over 24 m, density of saplings, and the amount
   of leaf litter decreased after harvesting, while canopy cover greater
   than or equal to0.5-3 m and the percent of bareground increased.
   Diameter-limit harvesting at the low intensity in our study might not
   adversely affect forest-dwelling songbirds in the central Appalachians
   in the short-term and forest bird communities could be retained. (C)

Abstract = {{Long-term qualitative observations suggest a marked decline in quaking
   aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) primarily due to advancing succession
   and fire suppression. This study presents an ecoregional coarse-grid
   analysis of the current aspen situation using Forest Health Monitoring
   (FHM) data from Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado.
   A unique feature of aspen forests in western North America is
   regeneration primarily by asexual ``suckering{''} although rare seeding
   events do occur, The dominant clonal process provides the basis for this
   analysis. In essence, the remaining aspen steins of previously large
   clones provide a window to the past and possibly a view of the future.
   The author uses baseline observations of aspen and associated tree
   species regeneration, forest size and structure components, stand age,
   tree damage, and recent disturbance to assess regional aspen conditions.
   Analysis of stands where aspen is dominant (aspen forest type) and where
   aspen merely occurs (aspen present) are presented. Basic groupings
   within the aspen forest type plots were obtained by cluster analysis of
   10 FHM variables derived from tree- and plot-level measurements. Stable
   and unstable aspen forest types were verified using principal component
   analysis, A further criterion of at least 25\% conifer species present
   was placed on the unstable group to render a more conservative
   population estimate of instability.
   The unstable aspen forest types, along with the plots having only the
   presence of aspen, comprise the dynamic portion of the aspen community
   in this area. These results support the hypothesis of an aspen decline
   within the past 100 years. However, additional regional plots and
   long-term remeasurements should provide a clearer picture of the
   decline's extent. Altering current and future management practices may
   significantly affect the rate of change. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Aim We examined the effects of drought in the summer of 1995 and the
   subsequent year on contrasting species of plants, moths, butterflies and
   ground beetles. We tested whether population increases were associated
   with: (a) species of warm environments (b) species of dry environments
   (c) species with rapid reproduction (d) species with high rates of
   dispersal.
   Location The study was conducted at Environmental Change Network (ECN)
   sites throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
   Methods Climate monitoring, recording of plant species in permanent
   plots, transect waking for butterflies, light trapping for moths and
   pitfall trapping for carabid beetles were used.
   Results There was an overall increase in the number of species recorded
   in permanent vegetation plots between 1994 and 1996, principally among
   the annual and biennial vascular plants, probably as a result of gap
   colonization in grasslands. Most butterfly and moth species increased
   between 1994 and 1995. Among the butterflies, a southern distribution
   and high mobility were associated with species tending to increase
   throughout the period 1994-96, whereas declining species tended to have
   a northern distribution. A similar number of carabid beetle species
   increased as decreased in the period 1994-96; decreasing species tended
   to be associated with lower temperatures and wetter soils.
   Conclusions Current climate change scenarios indicate that the incidence
   of droughts in the United Kingdom will increase. A series of dry, hot
   summers could lead to a rapid change in the population of some species
   although others, including many plants, may be more resilient. This may
   lead to complex changes in ecosystems and needs to be considered in
   planning conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The hoot-calls of Wood Owls Strix woodfordii, recorded in the Kruger
   National Park, South Africa, from 1986 to 1998, are sufficiently
   different to distinguish individuals. Thirteer hoot-call variables,
   measured from recordings over this period, show that male and female
   Wood Owls have such temporal stability that these calls can be used
   reliably as a long-terra census technique. MANOVA, based on ordinations
   from principal component analysis, was used to identify individuals
   statistically between sampling periods. A forward stepwise discriminant
   function analysis achieved 100\% classification success of individual
   male (n=3) and female (n=4) owls from a single sampling period. For all
   the individuals recorded over the whole study period we achieved a
   classification success of 80.9\% (n=9) for male hoof: calls and of
   96.3\% (n=13) for female calls. We found mean occupation periods of
   82.25 and 65 months and annual turnover rates of 19.3\% and 13.65\% for
   males and females, respectively. Our survey, using vocalizations, is
   unique since we use data collected over a 12-year period to derive
   estimates of population turnover in Wood Owls, and consider what
   questions can be addressed in similar studies.}},

Abstract = {{The accidental introduction of the brown tree snake Boiga irregularis to
   Guam has resulted in the extirpation of most of the island's native
   terrestrial vertebrates, has created a health hazard to infants and
   children, and has resulted in economic losses. The high brown tree snake
   population densities on Guam, the species' adaptations for successful
   dispersal, and Guam's position as a focal point for commercial and
   military cargo shipments have created a high level of concern that brown
   tree snakes could spread from Guam to colonize other vulnerable
   locations. Cargo inspections using teams of handlers and their detector
   dogs form the last line of defense for preventing brown tree snake
   dispersal from Guam. We assessed the efficacy of the teams of handlers
   and their dogs during 1998 and 1999 for locating stowed brown tree
   snakes by planting live brown tree snakes (in escape-proof containers)
   in cargo without the knowledge of the handlers inspecting the cargo.
   Many of these inspections were monitored by a concealed observer to
   determine the reason if a planted snake was not located by the dog
   teams. For 1998 and 1999, we found similar efficacies of 61\% and 64\%,
   respectively. When the snakes were not located by the dogs, we found
   that twice as many were missed because the dog did not change its
   behavior in response to the snake rather than because the handler did
   not conduct an adequate search pattern. During daytime inspections we
   found a greater efficacy for outdoor inspections than for indoor
   inspections. We found that the average efficacy of 62\% for the 1998-99
   period was lower than the baseline efficacy of 70\% established in 1997.

Abstract = {{Plant response to variation in the surrounding biotic and abiotic
   environment often involves mechanisms that promote reproductive
   assurance. The goal of this study was to determine whether production of
   chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL) flowers as well as delayed CH
   selfing in the perennial herb Viola pubescens enhances reproductive
   output in a heterogeneous environment. A central Ohio population was
   monitored for several years to study its reproductive biology and to
   measure selfing rates in CH flowers. A temporal switch from CH to CL
   flowers corresponded with a reduction in light availability as the
   forest canopy formed. Although similar numbers of CH and CL flowers were
   produced per plant, CH flowers were nearly twice as likely to disperse
   seeds as CL flowers. Both floral types had similar numbers of seeds with
   comparable mass, and there was no difference in emergence of CH and CL
   seedlings. In addition to outcrossing, CH flowers were capable of
   delayed selfing if left unvisited by insect pollinators. This was
   consistent with the rate of selfing over a 2-yr period (0.60, 0.07)
   measured with allozymes. Both CH and CL flowers contributed to
   reproduction in V. pubescens as well as delayed CH selfing, thereby
   creating a mating system that may be an adaptation to pollinator or
   resource unpredictability within the flowering season.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1 April 1998, the international trade in Acipenseriformes (25
   species of sturgeon and 2 paddle-fish) is monitored and controlled under
   CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
   Fauna and Flora). CITES trade data for 1998 suggest that the
   international trade in caviar is substantial, totalling 275 tonnes, and
   dominated by a few nations: 95\% of the caviar is exported and imported
   by less than 20 countries. The 1998 world exports, as reported by CITES
   Parties, also included 44.6 tonnes of sturgeon meat and 0.5 million live
   specimens (juveniles and fertilised eggs) of sturgeon and paddlefish.
   Data analysis and consultation with relevant authorities and traders
   indicate that CITES listing of all Acipenseriformes has resulted in
   better monitoring and control of the international trade of these
   species. Range states were recommended to establish annual export quotas
   for specimens and products of Acipenseriformes, but the scientific bases
   for setting these quotas are often unclear and would benefit from
   verification by independent experts. This mechanism was initiated
   following the decision adopted in April 2000 of incorporating
   Acipenseriformes in the Significant Trade Review of CITES. Primary
   results concluded that for six species (Acipenser gueldenstaedti, A.
   nudiventris, A. schrencki, A. stellatus, Huso huso and H. dauricus) the
   provisions of CITES were not implemented properly by range States and
   international trade may therefore be detrimental to the survival of wild
   populations. Under the Significant Trade Review CITES has the capacity
   to influence the conservation strategy implemented by exporting
   countries that are Parties to the Convention. It is an on-going process
   that will continue as long as the CITES forum considers that ranges
   States do not comply with CITES provisions.}},

Abstract = {{Howling was elicited in three wolf packs, monitored on the Italian
   Apennines, between 1996 and 2000. To test their attitude to reply to
   extraneous individuals, wolves were stimulated by playback of
   tape-recorded howls emitted from prominent sites. Responses were
   recorded and processed by sonographic analysis, discriminating between
   choral and single replies, and evaluating the presence/absence of cubs,
   The overall reply rate was 12.6\%. Responsiveness was high during late
   summer-early fall, a period coinciding with abandonment of the den and
   translocation of the litter to rendezvous sites. At this time, chorus
   howling represented the majority of total replies, and the quickness of
   responses suggests a higher bent to vocalize, Throughout the year, late
   evening and dawn were the parts of the day at which wolves showed the
   maximum tendency to respond.}},

Abstract = {{The Ankaratra Massif in central Madagascar includes rainforest between
   ca. 1500 and 2000 m elevation and montane savannah and heathland between
   ca. 2000 and 2642 m elevation. It is populated by 15 species of
   amphibians and 12 species of reptiles, all of which were observed in our
   surveys between 1992-2001. Additionally, the Ankaratra material housed
   in several herpetological collections was revised. Examination of type
   material showed that Scaphiophryne madagascariensis is the name to be
   applied to the scaphiophrynine microhylid frog occurring at Ankaratra;
   the previously used name S. pustulosa is a junior synonym, while
   populations from the Andringitra Massif so far considered as S.
   madagascariensis do not belong to this species. Reproductive behaviour
   and advertisement calls are described for S. madagascariensis. Two other
   frog species (Boophis williamsi, Mantidactylus pauliani) were observed
   for the first time for almost 30 years; their live coloration and
   morphology are described. The skink Amphiglossus macrocercus is shown to
   be live-bearing. Breeding in the austral summer could be demonstrated
   for most species, including the geckos Lygodactylus mirabilis and
   Phelsuma barbouriwhich are known to lay eggs also in the cold winter
   months (July-September). The higher-level taxonomic composition of the
   Ankaratra herpetofauna recalls that of the rainforests of eastern
   Madagascar, and also the species show mainly eastern affinities. A
   number of groups (especially snakes) are under-represented and some
   (e.g., nocturnal geckos and dwarf chameleons) are totally lacking. Three
   high-elevation specialists (B. williamsi, M. pauliani, L. mirabilis)
   appear to be Ankaratra endemics (11\% of the overall community). Pending
   further surveys and taxonomic revisions, more that one fifth of the
   herpetofauna (six species or more) may be endemic or semi-endemic to the
   region, which is not included in the network of Madagascar's protected
   areas. A monitoring program is therefore proposed to assess the
   conservation status of these poorly known taxa.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and phenology of mites, leafhoppers, and thrips were
   monitored monthly (May-October) during 1999-2000 in three pairs of
   pesticide-treated/untreated wine grape vineyards in southcentral
   Washington. Spider mite populations (primarily Tetranychus urticae Koch)
   were generally small (0-10 mites/leaf) and showed little monthly
   variation. They were significantly larger in pesticide-treated (season
   mean: 19.2\% of leaves occupied) than in untreated (1.3\%) vineyards in
   2000. The greatest mite density (65\% of leaves occupied/14 mites per
   leaf) was seen after 13 applications of sulfur in an additional vineyard
   monitored in 2000. Six species of phytoseiid mites were recorded
   (Galendromus occidentalis Nesbitt, Amblyseius andersoni {[}Chant],
   Typhlodromus caudiglans {[}Schuster], Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten,
   Metaseiulus citri {[}Garman and McGregor], and Metaseiulus flumensis
   {[}Chant]). G. occidentalis and M. citri accounted for 80-83\% of
   specimens identified. Phytoseiid populations were larger in untreated
   (season means: 7.1-9.1\% of leaves occupied) than in treated (1.8-4.6\%)
   vineyards and tended to increase in mid to late summer (up to two mites
   per leaf). Fungivorus tydeid mites were occasionally common in
   pesticide-treated and untreated vineyards in autumn (up to 73\% of
   leaves occupied). Nymphs of the leafhoppers, Erythroneura elegantula
   Osborn and Erythroneura ziczac Walsh were more abundant in untreated
   (season means: 19.4-52.2\% of leaves occupied) than treated (3.3-13.1\%)
   vineyards with densities of up to 21 per leaf. Populations peaked in
   August in 1999 and July in 2000. Thrips nymphs (primarily Frankliniella
   occidentalis {[}Pergande]) were equally common in pesticide-treated and
   untreated vineyards (season means: 12.9-18.2\% of leaves occupied) but
   tended to be more abundant early season in pesticide-treated vineyards.
   Implications of these results for improved arthropod pest management in
   Washington grapes are discussed.}},

Title = {{Shared predators and indirect trophic interactions: lemming cycles and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{1. We investigated the hypothesis that cyclic lemming populations
   indirectly affect arctic nesting greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens
   atlanticus L.) through the behavioural and numerical responses of shared
   predators.
   2. The study took place on Bylot Island in the Canadian High Arctic
   during two lemming cycles. We recorded changes in foraging behaviour and
   activity rate of arctic foxes, parasitic jaegers, glaucous gulls and
   common ravens in a goose colony during one lemming cycle and we
   monitored denning activity of foxes for 7 years. We also evaluated the
   total response of predators (i.e. number of eggs depreciated).
   3. Arctic foxes were more successful in attacking lemmings than goose
   nests because predators were constrained by goose nest defence.
   Predators increased their foraging effort on goose eggs following a
   lemming decline.
   4. Activity rates in the goose colony varied 3.5-fold in arctic foxes
   and 4.8-fold in parasitic jaegers. and were highest 2 and 3 years after
   the lemming peak. respectively. The breeding output of arctic foxes
   appeared to be driven primarily by lemming numbers.
   5. Predators consumed 19-88\% of the annual goose nesting production and
   egg predation intensity varied 2-7-fold, being lowest during peak
   lemming years. Arctic foxes and parasitic jaegers were the key predators
   generating marked annual variation in egg predation.
   6. Our study provides strong support for short-term. positive indirect
   effects and long-term. negative indirect effects of lemming populations
   on arctic-nesting geese. The outcome between these opposing indirect
   effects is probably an apparent competition between rodents and many
   terrestrial arctic-nesting birds.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of spider disperse by ballooning (aerial dispersal), and
   indices of aerial activity are required in studies of population
   dynamics and biological control in field crops where spider immigrants
   are needed for pest Suppression. Current methods (e.g., suction traps,
   sticky traps, deposition traps) of monitoring aerial activity are very
   labor-intensive, expensive, or require a power supply. We tested
   Ballooning Index (BI), an alternative, simple method utilizing
   inexpensive equipment. This method involved the monitoring of spiders
   climbing an array of 30 cm tall wooden sticks placed vertically in short
   turf. During a two-year study in arable land in the UK, the incidence of
   spiders (mainly Linyphiidae) on sticks was correlated with the numbers
   caught at 1.4 m and 12.2 in above ground in suction traps. Climbing
   activity on sticks was greater during the morning than in the afternoon,
   and this activity started progressively earlier in summer than in
   winter. There was no seasonal change in the proportion of spiders caught
   at the two heights in suction traps. The pattern of catches (on sticks
   and in suction traps) suggested strongly that the majority of ballooning
   spiders dispersed by a number of short flights, rather than by a single
   long flight, and that segregation of immigrants and emigrants is not
   possible by any current method. The BI method appears to be, however, a
   simple and reliable technique for monitoring the overall aerial activity
   of ballooning spiders.}},

Abstract = {{Pardosa species do not over winter in the adult stage in the Holarctic
   region, therefore penultimate instars should avoid precocious maturation
   in autumn. We tested how artificially increased temperature and/or
   lengthened light regime would affect the pre-overwintering development
   of two common species with different phenological patterns. Juvenile
   instars of Pardosa agrestis (Westring 1861) and P. hortensis (Thorell
   1872) were collected in autumn from the field. The experimental spiders
   were held either indoor at 26 degreesC or outdoors at ambient
   temperature and were exposed either to short or to long daylength.
   Molting events were monitored for five months. At outdoor temperatures
   no spiders reached adulthood and molts of younger instars occurred more
   frequently at long daylength. In the indoor temperature groups all P.
   hortensis and the majority of P. agrestis individuals reached adulthood
   during the experiment. Long daylength treatment enhanced the effect of
   increased temperature by almost halving the time needed to reach
   adulthood in both species. Penultimate instars of both species needed at
   least 17 days to molt, while earlier instars, present only in P.
   agrestis, responded rapidly to higher temperature by molting. This stage
   dependent response suggests that earlier instars can use favorable
   autumnal temperatures to catch up with penultimate instars which leads
   to higher synchrony of developmental stages in the overwintering and
   spring populations.}},

Abstract = {{One part of Radiological Monitoring Programme in central Cuba
   (1991-1995) was dedicated to study the background levels of natural and
   anthropogenic radioactivity in Cienfuegos Bay in the vicinity of the
   first Cuban nuclear power station under construction. Po-210 and Cs-137
   concentrations in fish. molluscs and crustaceans collected in Cienfuegos
   Bay were determined and the committed effective doses (CED) were
   calculated for two population groups inhabiting this region, The highest
   values of Po-210 concentrations were found in crustaceans, but
   significant accumulation was also observed in fish and molluscs. The
   mean Cs-137 concentrations in organisms are several times lower with
   respect to Po-210, a situation that characterises the regions affected
   by the global fallout only. Values of CED from the consumption of
   crustaceans and molluscs are very low both from Po-210 and Cs-137. The
   mean individual dose from Po-210 in the seafood consumed varies from 39
   muSv for general populations to 2802 muSv for the ``critical group{''}
   consuming 320 kg of fish per year. The dose from Cs-137 is negligible.

Abstract = {{Arctic residents, whose diets comprise a large proportion of traditional
   terrestrial and freshwater foodstuffs, have received the highest
   radiation exposures to artificial radionuclides in the Arctic. Doses to
   members of both the average population and selected indigenous
   population groups in the Arctic depend on the rates of consumption of
   locally-derived terrestrial and freshwater foodstuffs, including
   reindeer/caribou meat, freshwater fish, goat cheese, berries, mushrooms
   and lamb. The vulnerability of arctic populations, especially indigenous
   peoples, to radiocaesium deposition is much greater than for temperate
   populations due to the importance of terrestrial, semi-natural exposure
   pathways where there is high radiocaesium transfer and a long ecological
   half-life for this radionuclide. In contrast, arctic residents with
   diets largely comprising marine foodstuffs have received comparatively
   low radiation exposures because of the lower levels of contamination of
   marine organisms. Using arctic-specific information, the predicted
   collective dose is five times higher than that estimated by UNSCEAR for
   temperate areas. The greatest threats to human health and the
   environment posed by human and industrial activities in the Arctic are
   associated with the potential for accidents in the civilian and military
   nuclear sectors. Of most concern are the consequences of potential
   accidents in nuclear power plant reactors, during the handling and
   storage of nuclear weapons, in the decommissioning of nuclear submarines
   and in the disposal of spent nuclear fuel from vessels. It is important
   to foster a close association between risk assessment and practical
   programmes for the purposes of improving monitoring, formulating
   response strategies and implementing action plans. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes the study design, measurement protocols, and
   results of a project examining residential magnetic-field exposures at
   eight sites across the contiguous United States. The goal of the project
   was to investigate surrogates that have been used in epidemiologic
   studies to characterize residential magnetic-field exposure. These
   surrogates include: personal-exposure (PE), fixed-location long-term
   (LT), and outside and inside point-in-time (PIT) magnetic-field
   measurements; net-service (or ground current) measurements; and the
   ``wire-code category{''} of the residence. (The latter is a surrogate
   for magnetic-field exposure based on the nature and proximity of
   electric power lines outside the house.) Measurements were conducted on
   four visits to each of eight sites between January 1994 and June 1997
   for a study population of 218 single-unit detached dwellings.
   Information on the residence, residents, and neighborhood was collected.
   A simple random sample of 392 single-unit detached dwellings at the
   sites was used to create a weighted sample of houses representative of
   the population of single-unit residences. The correlations among the
   various types of 60-Hz magnetic-field measures were relatively strong
   (Pearson r>0.74, Spearman p>0.78). Variability of PE and LT
   measurements, as measured by the standard deviations during a visit, was
   independent of wire-code category. Visit means for PE, LT, and outside
   and inside PIT were well correlated over periods between visits of from
   1,5 to 20 months (r>0.62, p>0.76). These results support the use of
   survey measurements (less demanding than personal monitoring) to
   represent exposure that occurred up to 20 months in the past. The
   principal component of the total variance in PE measurements was the
   between-house variance; between visit and between-site variances were
   generally less important. This supports the sampling of many houses with
   relatively few visits in residential exposure characterization studies.
   There was a trend for presumably higher wire-code categories to be
   associated with higher field summary measures for all summary measures
   related to magnetic-field magnitude, including PE and LT resultant, and
   inside and outside resultant (60 Hz) and harmonics. However, because of
   the overlap in field levels between categories, wire code was not a good
   predictor of magnetic-field levels, accounting for less than 21\% of the
   variance in magnetic-field measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-tagged double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) nesting
   on Middle Island, Ontario and unmarked cormorants in the western basin
   of Lake Erie were monitored in 1999. Radio-tagged cormorants were
   located by aircraft and by boat along regular survey routes. In
   addition, foraging flocks of radio-tagged and unmarked cormorants were
   located during the boat surveys. Approximately 79\% of foraging
   radio-tagged individuals, and approximately 65\% of all foraging flocks
   it,ere observed within 2.5 kin of shore. these percentages were greater
   than expected, based on the percentage of the area of water within 2.5
   km of shore. All size classes of flocks examined were found more
   frequently than expected on water:5 10 in deep. Trawling data collected
   annually from 1988 to 1999 during the month of August were used to
   determine the historical distributions of the four fish species found to
   comprise the majority, of the diet of cormorants in the area. August
   corresponded to a period when there is maximal overlap in the diets of
   cormorants and walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) in the area and when the
   number of foraging cormorants in the area is large. Flocks of cormorants
   of all size classes examined were not found proportionately more in
   regions that contained higher than the historical median annual catches
   of any of the four prey species. These results, coupled with previous
   bioenergetics studies, suggest that the impact of cormorants on the
   fishery, of the western basin of Lake Erie is localized with respect to
   depth and distance from shore.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring coastal change is vital because a high percentage of the
   world's population lives in close proximity to coastal areas. This paper
   examines a portion of Lake Superior's shoreline vi,here coastal
   landscape has been shaped by the introduction of 25 billion kg of stamp
   sand from the copper industry and subsequent dynamics associated with
   longshore currents. Shoreline areal change from this movement is
   documented through comparison of archival and current air photos. A
   series of historical air photo mosaics were processed with a Geographic
   Information System (GIS). Sets of spatially registered, temporal map
   polygons were developed to illustrate and allow, measurement of the
   areas of erosion and deposition, relevant to shoreline planning and
   measurement. Measurements indicate that the length of shoreline affected
   by the stamp sand increased by 2.4 km during a 59-year period.
   Measurements of area indicate a decrease of 8 ha in the same amount of
   time. Breadth of the stamp sand shows discernable decline of 630 in
   width at the original deposit area at the north near Gay, Michigan, and
   increase of 410 m width 1,500 in southward along the coast. The
   methodology and results are relevant to a diversity of linear and areal
   landscape considerations along shorelines (property rights, planning,
   conservation, etc.).}},

Abstract = {{We used four replicate outbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster to
   investigate whether the light regimes experienced during the pre-adult
   (larval and pupal) and early adult stages influence the free-running
   period (tau(DD)) of the circadian locomotor activity rhythm of adult
   flies. In a series of two experiments four different populations of
   flies were raised from egg to eclosion in constant light (LL), in
   light/dark (LD) 12:12 h cycle, and in constant darkness (DD). In the
   first experiment the adult male and female flies were directly
   transferred into DD and their locomotor activity was monitored, while in
   the second experiment the locomotor activity of the emerging adult flies
   was first assayed in LD 12:12 h for 15 days and then in DD for another
   15 days. The tau(DD) of the locomotor activity rhythm of flies that were
   raised in all the three light regimes, LL, LD 12:12 h and in DD was
   significantly different from each other. The tau(DD) of the locomotor
   activity rhythm of the flies, which were raised in DD during their
   pre-adult stages, was significantly shorter than that of flies that were
   raised as pre-adults in LL regime, which in turn was significantly
   shorter than that of flies raised in LD 12:12 h regime. This pattern was
   consistent across both the experiments. The results of our experiments
   serve to emphasise the fact that in order to draw meaningful inferences
   about circadian rhythm parameters in insects, adequate attention should
   be paid to control and specify the environment in which pre-adult
   rearing takes place. The pattern of pre-adult and early adult light
   regime effects that we see differs from that previously observed in
   studies of mutant strains of D. melanogaster, and therefore, also points
   to the potential importance of inter-strain differences in the response
   of circadian organisation to external influences. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The insect populations of a botanicals warehouse in north-central
   Florida were studied to gain a better understanding of insect problems
   associated with stored botanicals and to identify measures that could be
   taken to mitigate the problems. The warehouse contained either dried saw
   palmetto berries, Serenoa repens (Bartram) Small, or dried
   passion-flower (maypop) vines, Passiflora incarnata (L.), depending on
   the season. Insect populations were monitored intermittently for one
   year using arrays of moth and beetle traps. Capture rate, relative
   abundance, and spatial distribution of different species were examined
   over time. The six most abundant species in order of abundance were:
   Cadra cautella (Walker), Lasioderma serricorne (F.), Oryzaephilus
   mercator (Fauvel), Typhaea stercorea(L.), Plodia interpunctella
   (Hubner), and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst). All of these appear capable
   of infesting saw palmetto, but the major pests were C. cautella and L.
   serricorne. Oryzaephilus mercator and P. interpunetella were also
   important, but T. castaneum and T. stereorea were minor. Passion-flower
   was a less suitable host than saw palmetto for all of the species except
   T. stercorea. Nevertheless, all of the six species infesting saw
   palmetto except O. mercator were captured in numbers sufficient to
   indicate that they were also capable of infesting passionflower.
   Lasioderma serricorne was the major pest. Spatial analysis of trap
   captures revealed that the insect distributions changed as different
   botanicals were brought in, removed, or redistributed in the storage
   area. Potential measures to mitigate insect problems in stored
   botanicals are discussed, including spatial targeting of insect control
   and sanitation efforts. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Phenology and pattern (direction and distance from mother plant) of seed
   dispersal were monitored in a population of the facultative woodland
   biennial Arabis laevigata var. laevigata. Dispersal began soon after

   percent of the seeds on 1986 seed-producing plants in the population had
   been dispersed by 22 September 1986 and about 92\% by 2 March 1987.
   Length of time an individual plant dispersed seeds ranged from 14 to 586
   days (mean +/- SE = 202 +/- 12.8 days). The majority of seeds fell <0.5
   m from the parent plants, direction of dispersal was preferentially to
   the south, and the shape of the dispersal distance-seed density curve
   was concave. Number of seeds retained on dispersing plants declined
   exponentially with increase in time after beginning of dispersal. The
   possible ecological advantages of an extended period of seed dispersal

Abstract = {{We investigated reproductive phenology and fecundity in a population of
   the facultative biennial Arabis laevigata var. laevigata over a 2-year
   period in its rocky deciduous woodland habitat in northcentral Kentucky,
   USA. In contrast to most facultative biennials, A. laevigata grows in a
   habitat that nay remain stable for a long period of time. Bolting
   (flower stalk elongation) occurred in March, anthesis peaked in raid
   April, and seeds matured in June/July. Probability of bolting increased
   with rosette size, which was highly correlated with number of seeds
   produced. Only 150 of 233 (64.4\%) bolted plants monitored in 1986 and
   1987 survived and produced seeds. Adults in 1987 produced taller flower
   stalks, more siliques per plant, longer siliques, and more seeds per
   plant than did adults in 1986. Arabis laevigata is similar to other
   facultative biennials in that onset of reproduction is size-dependent,
   not age-dependent, and fecundity is positively correlated with rosette
   size at time of reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Time budgets of predators may reflect population status if time spent
   foraging varies with local prey abundance. We assumed that the sea otter
   (Enhydra lutris) population at Amchitka Island, Alaska, USA, had been at
   equilibrium since the early 1960s and collected time budgets of otters
   to be used to represent future conditions of currently expanding sea
   otter populations. We used radiotelemetry to monitor activity-time
   budgets of otters from August 1992 to March 1994. Sea otter activity was
   directly linked to sex, age, weather condition, season, and time of day.
   Sea otters differed in percent time foraging among cohorts but not
   within cohorts. Percent time foraging ranged from 21\% for females with
   very young (53 weeks of age) dependent pups to 52\% for females with old
   (greater than or equal to10 weeks of age) pups. Otters foraged more and
   hauled out more as local sea conditions worsened. Adult males spent less
   time foraging during winter and spring, consistent with seasonal changes
   in prey selection. Time spent foraging was similar to that reported for
   otters in California and an established population in Prince William
   Sound, Alaska, but greater than that of otters in recently established
   populations in Oregon and Alaska. Despite current evidence indicating
   that the population was in decline during our study, we were unable to
   recognize this change using time budgets. Our results illustrate the
   importance of stratifying analyses of activity patterns by age and sex
   cohorts and the complexity inherent in comparisons of behavioral data
   between different populations relying on distinct prey bases.}},

Abstract = {{We studied depredation rates on free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries)
   bv Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in 2 areas in Norway to test whether
   selected individuals or a demographic group within a lynx population
   kill a disproportionate share of livestock. During 6 grazing seasons
   from 1994 to 1999, we monitored 34 radiocollared lynx during 641
   tracking periods (either all night or during a full 24-hr period).
   Sixty-three domestic sheep and 3 domestic goats were killed by
   radiocollared lynx during these periods. All of the radiocollared lynx
   had access to free-ranging domestic sheep within their annual home
   ranges. Male lynx killed sheep more frequently than females and were
   responsible for 12 out of 13 cases of surplus killing. After adjusting
   for number of nights monitored, sheep-killing rates among males differed
   slightly, whereas the differences between individual females were
   correlated with the number of sheep available. There were no indications
   of any special ``problem individuals,{''} but rather a ``problem
   sex.{''} There fore, it seems to be intrinsic in their behavior that
   males are likely to kill domestic animals more frequently than females.
   The lack of specific problem individuals in this study might depend on
   the livestock-herding technique used in Norway, where sheep generally
   are free-ranging and unattended throughout a lynx's home range.
   Selective removal of depredating males requires that the gap in the
   social mosaic either remains unfilled or is filled by an individual that
   causes less damage to livestock. The effects of such removal on sheep
   depredation are likely to be only temporary since all adult and yearling
   male lynx appear to kill sheep.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable estimates of population growth rates and densities are
   fundamental for effective wildlife management programs. We assessed the
   precision of spotlight-counting as a technique to monitor changes in
   rabbit abundance by fitting simple population growth models to observed.
   trends in spotlight-count data during an 18-month period of increase in
   European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) abundance at sites in North
   Canterbury, New Zealand. A model-selection approach identified a simple
   exponential population growth model, allowing the observed rate of
   increase to differ between spring-summer (Aug-Feb) and autumn-winter
   (Mar-Jul) to be an adequate description of the observed data. The
   exponential rate of increase (r) over the study period differed markedly
   between spring :summer and autumn-winter periods, and averaged 2.3
   yr(-1) and 2.5 yr(-1) for the 2 sites monitored. We used the fitted
   exponential model to estimate the observation error per spotlight
   transect. The estimated coefficient of variation for 1 night of counting
   of 10-km transects was 16\%. With such data and model assumptions, only
   a modest number of surveys would be required to detect, with a high
   degree of certainty, moderate changes in spotlight-count indices of
   rabbit abundance either by analysis of variance or log-linear
   regression.}},

   water temperature and body length. The highest values of RNA and protein
   were recorded in late summer, and were 4.0 and 47.7 mug mg(-1) dry

Abstract = {{Monitoring of fish populations underwater and of fish catches is being
   undertaken at several sites in Kenya and Tanzania using local names and
   languages. This paper describes the programmes underway at Kiunga Marine
   Reserve and Diani-Chale in Kenya, and at Tanga in Tanzania. At all three
   sites, standard protocols have been adapted for use by local fishermen,
   who have been trained to collect data. A key factor enabling this has
   been to use local knowledge as the foundation of monitoring. The paper
   discusses some of the difficulties encountered, such as variations in
   the use of names, and generally low literacy among fishermen. Overall,
   the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages in terms of developing a
   much greater sense of involvement in, and participation by, the fishing
   communities in the management of their resources. The programmes are
   also providing the fishermen with a deeper understanding of the impact
   of fishing on their resources and thus will help them to apply
   appropriate management approaches.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{205-212}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale bleaching events are major disturbances to coral health and
   community structure, but may also affect other coral reef taxa, such as
   fishes. In 1997-1998, wide-spread coral bleaching and mortality occurred
   across the Great Barrier Reef, caused by increases in sea surface
   temperatures resulting from El Nino Southern Oscillation. As part of
   this event, in February-March 1998, there was extensive bleaching within
   One Tree Island lagoon (southern Great Barrier Reef), such that almost
   12 mo later there was a significant reduction of live coral cover at
   some sites. We monitored the distribution of adults and recruitment of
   damselfishes (Pomacentridae) to sites within One Tree Island in
   1993-1995 and in 1999. Fish species that normally associate with live
   corals showed relatively lower recruitment at bleached sites compared to
   the same sites pre-bleaching or to recovered sites and, as a result,
   species diversity and assemblage structure of recruits changed. Compared
   to 1993/1995 densities, adult Pomacentrus wardi, P. moluccensis and
   Chrysiptera rollandi densities dropped at bleached sites, but not at
   unbleached sites. While P. moluccensis directly associate with live
   corals, the other 2 species do not. This study has demonstrated that
   indirect effects of bleaching can include changes in assemblage
   structure of reef fish adults and recruits.}},

Title = {{Effects of freshwater flow on abundance of estuarine organisms: physical
   effects or trophic linkages?}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{243}},
Pages = {{39-55}},
Abstract = {{All ecosystems are influenced by physical forcing. Estuarine ecosystems
   respond most strongly on an interannual timescale to variability in
   freshwater flow. Several mechanisms for positive or negative flow
   effects on biological populations in estuaries have been proposed;
   however, positive effects appear to operate mainly through stimulation
   of primary production with effects propagating up the food web. In the
   northern San Francisco Estuary, abundance or survival of several common
   species of fish and shrimp varied positively with flow-in data through
   1992. I re-examined these relationships and those of several additional
   taxa in an analysis of long-term (20 to 40 yr) monitoring data. The
   spread of the introduced clam Potamocorbula amurensis in 1987 provided
   an opportunity to examine simultaneously the responses of estuarine
   species to flow and to changes in the food web. I separated variability
   into a flow response, a step change after 1987 and other sources of
   variability. Responses of fish and shrimp contrasted with those of lower
   trophic levels. All but 1 species of nekton responded positively to
   flow, only 2 had clear declines after 1987, and none of the
   relationships changed in slope after 1987. In contrast with the higher
   trophic levels, chlorophyll a (chl a) and several species of zooplankton
   declined markedly after 1987, and had either weak responses to flow or
   responses that changed after 1987. Thus, the food web appears strongly
   coupled between benthos and plankton, and weakly coupled between
   zooplankton and fish, as has been found in other systems. More
   importantly, the variation with freshwater flow of abundance or survival
   of organisms in higher trophic levels apparently did not occur through
   upward trophic transfer, since a similar relationship was lacking in
   most of the data on lower trophic levels. Rather, this variation may
   occur through attributes of physical habitat that vary with flow.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed the effects of local- (sea-surface temperature {[}SST] and
   windspeed) and large- (multivariate El Nino index) scale weather
   conditions and timing of breeding on reproductive parameters of tropical
   roseate terns Sterna dougallii on Aride Island, Seychelles, using up to
   17 years of data. The size of the breeding population and initiation of
   breeding were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with
   both SST and the multivariate El Nino index for the laying season
   (May-June). It is the first time that an El Nino index obtained for the
   Pacific Ocean is shown to be correlated with reproductive parameters of
   seabirds in the Indian Ocean. Hatching success decreased significantly
   with later initiation of breeding. Virtually no chicks fledged when
   breeding started in June (40 \% of the years monitored). We suggest that
   oceanographic conditions over a relatively large scale have an influence
   on tern arrival date to the breeding grounds and that SST abound the
   breeding colony influences the number of birds that attempt to breed.
   Despite the influence of factors such as predatory fish on food
   availability, this influence appears to be overridden by the importance
   of weather events and oceanographic conditions, which are likely to
   determine marine productivity. This study suggests that ecosystem-level
   phenomena appear to be important in shaping the population dynamics of
   tropical roseate terns.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgal populations along French coasts (English Channel, Bay of
   Biscay and Mediterranean Sea) have been sampled twice a month since 1987
   within the context of the French Phytoplankton and Phycotoxin Monitoring
   Network (REPHY). This study used these data to characterize the
   large-scale geographical structures of microphytoplankton communities
   and to determine whether `homogeneous' geographical areas exist in which
   microalgal populations display similar temporal variability schemes.
   Once the temporal variability component shared by all sampled coastal
   sites was identified, the `residual' site-specific component was
   analyzed. Multivariate ordination methods were used to determine
   seasonal and inter-annual variability. The expected-temporal pattern
   common to all sites was identified and the seasonal cycle of the most
   frequently observed phytoplankton communities along French coasts was
   described. The between-site analysis, using multitable comparison
   methods (RV-coefficient and multidimensional scaling), allowed the
   identification of 3 large areas (western English Channel, Bay of Biscay
   and Mediterranean Sea) according to the temporal variability patterns of
   microphytoplankton populations. The results, despite the coastal
   locations of REPHY sampling sites, indicate that the hydrodynamic
   characteristics of the different areas play a major role in the
   geographical structure of microalgal populations in French coastal
   waters.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue injury, in which the skeleton is stripped of living tissue, is
   common in reef-building corals and has potentially important demographic
   consequences. To examine the significance of tissue injury for natural
   populations, I monitored 1627 colonies in 30 taxa of Indo-Pacific
   branching corals at 3 to 5 mo intervals over a 2 yr period. Recent
   injury (inflicted within the few days prior to censusing) was a highly
   significant predictor of colony fate within 3 to 5 mo, for acroporid
   corals with small, compact branches (hispidose and corymbose growth
   forms). In contrast, colony size was not a significant predictor of fate
   for these corals after recent injury was included in the models. Both
   recent injury and colony size were significant predictors of fate for
   pocilloporids (small bushy growth form). Neither were good predictors of
   fate for arborescent acroporids (large, widely-spaced branches), even
   though recent injury was up to 3 times more common in these corals. Old
   injury (inflicted several weeks or more prior to censusing) covering >
   5\% of the colony was a highly significant predictor of colony death
   within 3 to 5 mo for corymbose species. Colonies with both old and
   recent injuries were highly likely to die: 33 and 54\% of colonies in
   separate censuses died within 3 mo. The predictive power of recent
   injury implies chronic or repetitive tissue loss and prolonged decline,
   since most recent injuries were small (<30 cm(2)) and did not account
   for the colony decline per se. Since colony size was not as good a
   predictor of colony fate as recent injury for small-branched acroporids,
   size-based population models for these corals may be improved by
   incorporating tissue injury as an indicator of colony condition.}},

Title = {{Harlequin duck population recovery following the `Exxon Valdez' oil
   spill: progress, process and constraints}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{241}},
Pages = {{271-286}},
Abstract = {{Following the 1989 `Exxon Valdez' oil spill in Prince William Sound,
   Alaska, we studied the status of recovery of harlequin duck Histrionicus
   histrionicus populations during 1995 to 1998. We evaluated potential
   constraints on full recovery, including (1) exposure to residual oil;
   (2) food limitation; and (3) intrinsic demographic limitations on
   population growth rates. In this paper, we synthesize the findings from
   our work and incorporate information from other harlequin duck research
   and monitoring programs to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the
   response of this species to the `Exxon Valdez' spill. We conclude that
   harlequin duck populations had not fully recovered by 1998. Furthermore,
   adverse effects continued as many as 9 yr after the oil spill, in
   contrast to the conventional paradigm that oil spill effects on bird
   populations are short-lived. These conclusions are based on the findings
   that (1) elevated cytochrome P450 (CYP1A) induction on oiled areas
   indicated continued exposure to oil in 1998; (2) adult female winter.
   survival was lower on oiled than unoiled areas during 1995 to 1998; (3)
   fall population surveys by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game
   indicated numerical declines in oiled areas during 1995 to 1997; and (4)
   densities on oiled areas in 1996 and 1997 were lower than expected using
   models that accounted for effects of habitat attributes. Based on
   hypothesized links between oil contamination and demography, we suggest
   that harlequin duck population recovery was constrained primarily by
   continued oil exposure. Full population recovery will also be delayed by
   the time necessary for intrinsic population growth to allow return to
   pre-spill numbers following cessation of residual oil spill effects.
   Although not all wildlife species were affected by the `Exxon Valdez'
   oil spill, and some others may have recovered quickly from any effects,
   harlequin duck life history characteristics and benthic, nearshore
   feeding habits make them susceptible to both initial and long-term oil
   spill effects.}},

Title = {{Spatial synchrony of population changes in rocky shore communities in

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{39-48}},
Abstract = {{Rocky shore monitoring around the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal in Shetland
   has produced a 20 yr dataset of population fluctuations for 40-plus
   species at 15 to 20 sites separated by distances up to 30 km. Synchrony
   in population changes was quantified by correlation among series of
   abundance categorised on quantitative scales. Two periods were analysed
   separately, pre- and post-1992, following changes in methods and extent
   of monitoring. Positive average correlations among sites were found for
   10 out of 16 species pre-1992 and for 23 out of 26 post-1992,
   statistically significant for 4 and 8 species for the 2 periods,
   respectively. The intertidal barnacle Semibalanus balanoides showed most
   synchrony among sites for both periods, while dogwhelks Nucella lapillus
   and macroalgae (Fucus vesiculosus, F serratus, Mastocarpus stellatus)
   had very low average correlations among sites. Littorina saxatilis was
   the only other species with significant positive correlation among sites
   in both periods. Corallinaceae, Verrucaria maura and V mucosa, and
   Littorina neglecta were less synchronised pre-1992 than post-1992, while
   L. obtusata showed less synchrony post-1992. Differences in reproductive
   biology and ecology failed to explain patterns of synchrony among
   species. Species with planktonic larvae were no more likely to be
   synchronised than those without. There was a tendency for species living
   higher on the shore to be more synchronised post-1992, but species
   predominant on wave-exposed shores were no more synchronous than
   sheltered-shore species. The more synchronised species in this study
   need to be monitored at relatively few sites to detect change, whereas
   more sites may be needed for species in which change occurs on a local
   scale. Population synchrony also suggested usefulness of species as
   indicators of large-scale change: the barnacle S. balanoides is the best
   indicator among species in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of hydrographic, biological and meteorological variables
   on the abundance of Dinophysis spp. and the concentration of diarrhetic
   shellfish toxin (DST) in the plankton population were investigated in a
   mussel (Mytilus edulis) farm area on the Swedish west coast. This
   location provided an opportunity to simultaneously compare Dinophysis
   spp. cell numbers, concentration of DST in natural phytoplankton
   assemblages and toxicity of mussel tissues. Sampling was performed every
   other day from October 10 to November 5, 2000, and on each occasion, 5
   randomly selected sites were sampled. During this period, 3 distinct
   water masses passed through the vicinity of the mussel farm. The second
   water mass, characterized by low salinity and nitrogen concentration,
   was probably advected into the area from surface waters in the nearby
   Skagerrak. This low salinity water also contained a high abundance of
   Dinophysis spp., and high concentrations of DST were recorded in the
   phytoplankton population. Multivariate analysis (projection to latent
   structures by means of partial least squares, PLS) determined that the
   principal variables influencing the concentration of DST in the plankton
   assemblage were the causative species (D. acuminata, D. acuta and D.
   norvegica) and salinity. The abundance of the 3 Dinophysis spp. was
   inversely correlated to salinity. A rapid increase in the toxicity of
   mussels in response to the high levels of DST was observed. The
   concentration of DST had doubled within 2 d of the appearance of
   Dinophysis spp. After 8 d, the water mass containing Dinophysis spp. was
   replaced and cell numbers again returned to low levels. The
   concentration of DST in the phytoplankton samples remained high for
   another 2 d after the number of Dinophysis spp. had declined and the
   toxicity of mussels continued to be high for the remainder of the study.
   Causes of the rapid intoxication versus slow detoxification of mussels
   are discussed. These results suggest that present monitoring programs
   are insufficient to provide early warning of toxic blooms to
   aquaculturists on the Swedish west coast.}},

Abstract = {{In 3 successive years (1998 to 2000), the winter migration of rockhopper
   penguins Eudyptes chrysocome from 3 separate breeding colonies on the
   Falkland Islands was monitored using satellite transmitters. After their
   moult, 34 penguins were followed for a mean transmission period of 81
   +/- 21 d. While there were substantial spatial and temporal variations
   in migration patterns, we identified several foraging areas where food
   availability is presumably higher than elsewhere. Coastal areas of the
   Falkland Islands and South America appeared to provide a sufficient food
   supply, and many penguins commuted between these 2 areas, which are
   about 600 km apart. Rockhopper penguins from northern breeding colonies
   also used areas along the slope of the Patagonian Shelf up to
   39degreesS, about 1400 km northwards. By contrast, only a few birds from
   the southern breeding colony migrated to the Burdwood Bank, which is
   situated about 250 km to the south of the Falkland Islands, and adjacent
   oceanic waters. None of the penguins in this study left the maritime
   zone of the Falkland Islands in an easterly direction to forage in
   oceanic waters. The mean distances covered per day by individual birds
   varied greatly, depending on the phase of the foraging trip. The overall
   mean travelling speed was 26 km d(-1) (range: 13 to 45 km d-1).
   Inter-annual variation was evident both in the use of different foraging
   areas, and also in the time at which the winter migration began. In 1998
   and 2000, penguins from Seal Bay and Sea Lion Island left their breeding
   colony within 1 wk after being equipped with transmitters and did not
   return, whereas in 1999 most penguins made short foraging trips and
   returned repeatedly to their colonies for periods of up to 100 d.
   Potential threats to the rockhopper penguins during their winter
   migration, resulting from human activities such as fishing and oil
   pollution within the Falkland Islands maritime zone and the Argentine
   Exclusive Economic Zone, are discussed.}},

Title = {{Geographic variability in form, size and survival of Egregia menziesii
   around Point Conception, California}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{239}},
Pages = {{69-82}},
Abstract = {{Intra-specific morphological variability is common among many species of
   plants, and is particularly common among marine algae. Populations of
   the kelp Egregia menziesii (Turner) Areschoug are known to be extremely
   variable in form, and variability in this species is well-correlated
   with geographical distribution. Populations north of Point Conception,
   California, are characterized by individuals having thick, tough, wide
   stipes and small blades, whereas populations south of Point Conception
   are characterized by individuals having thin, smooth stipes and large
   blades. Point Conception (hereafter PC) is a well-known biogeographic
   boundary for many marine species, The region north of PC is typified by
   cold, nutrient-rich water favorable to plant growth, but also by high
   wave exposure, increasing the likelihood of plant breakage or
   dislodgement. The region south of PC is characterized by warmer,
   oligotrophic water (less favorable for plant growth), but the potential
   for plant breakage or dislodgment is low due to the calm seas in this
   region. Using reciprocal transplant experiments, we examined the
   potential adaptive value of the morphologies of both populations
   (northern and southern) in the light of these physical gradients among
   sites north and south of PC, and the tradeoff between rapid growth and
   increased risk of breakage. We reciprocally transplanted northern- and
   southern-form E. menziesii among several sites north and south of PC and
   monitored size and survival of each individual over a 5 mo period. In
   general, both survival and growth of the northern form was greatest at
   the northern sites, and southern form survival and growth was greatest
   at the southern sites, Overall, growth was greatest at the northern
   sites, and the greatest increase in size was achieved by a southern-form
   individual at a northern site. These results indicate that regionally
   specific morphological forms of E, menziesii seem to be uniquely adapted
   to maximize growth and survival under conditions typical of their native
   region. However, in the absence of breakage, southern-form E. menziesii
   have the potential to grow large under northern conditions.
   Northern-form E, menziesii have a reduced probability of breakage or
   dislodgment due to their high-strength, low-drag morphology.
   Southern-form E. menziesii have much lower breaking strengths and higher
   drag than northern forms, but have a higher surface area per unit of
   stipe, potentially advantageous for nutrient uptake in the low-nutrient
   environment south of Point Conception. Although these morphological
   forms appear to be advantageous within each of these regions, it remains
   to be explored whether their morphology can be altered at an early life
   stage or whether it is genetically fixed.}},

Abstract = {{The most extensive and severe bleaching of coral ever recorded occurred
   in 1997 and 1998 as a result of anomalously high sea-surface
   temperatures. In the Ryukyu Islands, extensive bleaching occurred from
   late July to early October in 1998. A time-series transect study on a
   reef flat revealed the different responses of coral populations among
   species to this event. Coral cover was monitored just before, during,
   and 6 times after the bleaching occurred, along 5 fixed transects, 710
   to 800 m long, across the reef flat of Shiraho Reef, Ishigaki Island, in
   the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. The dominant corals were Heliopora
   coerulea, massive Porites, and branching Porites, Montipora, Acropora,
   and Pavona (these latter 4 genera could not always be distinguished to
   species level, and are thus grouped by genus and ecoform). H. coerulea
   was the least susceptible to bleaching and maintained almost constant
   coverage before and after the bleaching. Massive Porites were
   susceptible to bleaching, but regained their algae after the bleaching
   and sustained their coverage. On the other hand, the branching Porites,
   Montipora, and Acropora were susceptible to bleaching and mortality was
   high. Coverage by branching Montipora was initially reduced by 66 \%,
   but by 2 yr after the bleaching it had recovered to pre-bleaching
   coverage. However, only large patches of more than 70 in along a
   transect, with coverage of 10 to 40 \%, recovered. Small patches of less
   than 30 m along a transect, with coverage of less than 10 \%, died and
   did not recover, The response of corals to bleaching differs according
   to the strategy the coral uses against bleaching; moderately frequent
   and severe bleaching might permit the coexistence of both types of
   corals on the same reef flat, as in the case of Shiraho Reef.}},

Abstract = {{The link between reproductive output and larval supply is described for
   a common damselfish species Pomacentrus vaiuli in tropical Western
   Australia. 1 monitored the reproduction of 2 groups of P. vaiuli that
   occupied slightly different habitats. Egg clutches laid on artificial
   substratum were quantified on a bi-weekly basis during the consecutive
   spawning seasons of 1994/95 and 1995/96. The timing of egg production
   was similar for both groups and showed a distinctly semi-lunar pattern.
   The majority of the larvae hatched during the period when flood tide
   occurred 2 h either side of sunset. At Ningaloo this only happens during
   neap tides when the tidal amplitude is at its minimum. However, this
   means that larvae are dispersed nocturnally when the risk of predation
   is minimal. No relationship was found between egg production and changes
   in water temperature. Spawning ended prematurely for 1 of these groups
   of fish following the passing of a tropical cyclone within 80 km of the
   coast. Larval supply of P. vaiuli was estimated in the vicinity of the
   reproductive sites by capturing pre-settlement fish at one of these
   locations (Tantabiddy), and post-settlement fish at the other (Bundegi).
   The arrival of P. vaiuli larvae to Tantabiddy was on a lunar cycle with
   periodicities between 28 to 30 d. When these larval supply data were
   lagged by the average pelagic duration of 22 d, and then
   cross-correlated with the spawning data, there was a weak relationship.
   At Bundegi, 1 constructed recruitment patterns and estimated the birth
   dates of juveniles, using otolith analysis. By back-calculating the
   birth dates of individual fish that settled at Bundegi I made 2
   discoveries. Firstly, most juveniles from 1994/95 hatched when spawning
   output at Bundegi was low, and secondly, more than 50 \% of fish caught
   in 1995/96 hatched after the spawning season had ended prematurely. This
   suggests that many of the juvenile P. vaiuli that settled at Bundegi
   during the second summer were not produced by this population but from
   elsewhere. I discuss the likelihood that larvae arriving to Ningaloo are
   from adult populations which inhabit fringing reefs to the north and
   that the observed patterns in larval supply are the result of an
   interaction between both physical and behavioural processes.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of genetic variability and assessment of population
   genetic losses are important components of environmental management
   programs. Twenty-three natural populations of the Mediterranean
   brackish-water toothcarp Aphanius fasciatus were investigated using
   different statistical approaches based on genetic data at 13 polymorphic
   allozyme loci, In general, no differences between values of
   within-population genetic variability estimates occurred. The Wilcoxon
   sign-rank test for heterozygosity excess due to a recent bottleneck was
   conducted on the array of populations, In addition, a qualitative
   descriptor of allele frequency distribution was used to infer
   bottlenecks. Only populations from the Orbetello lagoon and La Salina at
   Elba Island revealed significant heterozygosity excess under both the
   infinite allele model (IAM) and stepwise mutation model (SMM). A recent
   dystrophic crisis may account for the genetic loss detected in the
   population of A. fasciatus from the Orbetello lagoon, whereas
   exceptionally high predation pressure and/or the increased mortality
   rate created by local hydrological conditions could be responsible for
   the bottleneck in the population at La Salina. Tests for bottlenecks
   have proved effective tools for genetic monitoring of A. fasciatus
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for competition to influence the population dynamics of
   bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix and striped bass Morone saxatilis through
   interactions at the juvenile stage was examined. Habitat and diet
   utilization were compared between juvenile striped bass and bluefish in
   3 New York Bight marine embayments. Juvenile bluefish and striped bass
   were seldom captured together during the summer and early fall,
   suggesting low habitat overlap at the scale of a beach seine haul. Diet
   overlap was also low; age-0 bluefish (spring- and summer-spawned
   cohorts) had a more piscivorous diet than age-0 and age-1 striped bass.
   A 60d laboratory growth experiment tested for interference competition
   between age-0 bluefish (spring- spawned) and age-1 striped bass fed fish
   prey in mixed- and single-species treatments. In the growth experiment,
   bluefish grew significantly faster than striped bass; however, within a
   species, there was no significant difference in growth between the
   mixed- and single-species treatments. Additionally, long-term
   field-monitoring data showed that annual estimates of growth rate for
   bluefish and striped bass were not correlated with annual estimates of
   their potential competitor's density. These field and laboratory data
   provide no evidence for competitive interactions between juvenile

Title = {{Effect of diel and interday variations in light on the cell division
   pattern and in situ growth rates of the bloom-forming dinoflagellate
   Heterocapsa triquetra}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},

Abstract = {{Heterocapsa triquetra is an important bloom-forming dinoflagellate found
   in estuaries and nearshore regions worldwide. In an initial
   time-intensive study, the shallow, tidally mixed Newport River estuary,
   North Carolina, USA, was sampled from a fixed point located in the
   middle of the estuary every 2 h for 2 wk during the development of an H.
   triquetra bloom. The objective of this study was to investigate how
   short-term, high-frequency changes in temperature, light and salinity
   affected diel and interday cell division patterns and in situ growth
   rates of H, triquetra. During this study, phytoplankton samples were
   preserved in buffered formaldehyde and mitotic indices determined by
   acridine orange staining. The diel division pattern showed a nocturnal
   maximum between 23:00 and 05:00 h with reduced division during the day,
   a pattern characteristic of most dinoflagellates. The relative
   proportion of binucleate cells present during the day was influenced by
   interday variations in total irradiance, increasing during 2 of the 3
   periods when there were 3 or more consecutive high light days (>28 E
   m(-2) d(-1)), Approximately 40\% of the overall variation in interday
   division rates could be accounted for by differences in daily
   irradiance. The interday light differences were largely due to
   well-developed atmospheric frontal systems that brought increased cloud
   cover to the study area at regular 3 to 4 d intervals. The initial
   study, however, was of insufficient length to determine if the transient
   day-to-day light limitation could significantly affect seasonal bloom
   formation. A second longer-term, spatially intensive study was therefore
   undertaken to assess the relative importance of the incident light
   levels and nutrient inputs in controlling H. triquetra bloom initiation.
   During the second study, the estuary was monitored for
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), salinity, temperature,
   inorganic nutrients and cell densities of H. triquetra at 9 locations
   every wk from 23 December 1997 to 27 March 1998, Maximal H. triquetra
   bloom formation occurred during a 2 wk period when daily incident light
   levels were at or near the annual low. This suggested that H. triquetra
   is well adapted for utilizing low light levels and that variation in in
   situ growth rates in response to daily changes in PAR had little effect
   on bloom development. Instead, bloom initiation began with inputs of
   nitrogen-rich water following a runoff event, indicating that nutrient
   inputs are much more important in controlling bloom development than is
   light.}},

Pages = {{157-164}},
Abstract = {{While larval supply patterns play a major role in determining the
   distribution and abundance of reef fishes at a range of spatial and
   temporal scales, events occurring in the weeks after settlement May also
   significantly alter the demography of a juvenile population. I monitored
   over 2 summers the arrival of new recruits of 6 species of benthic
   damselfish onto continuous and patch reef habitat in One Tree Island
   lagoon. Each species had specific habitat preferences, and most showed
   some form of patchiness in spatial and temporal distribution at
   settlement; however, this was most likely a result of group settlement
   rather than habitat patchiness. Tagged recruits of Pomacentrus
   amboinensis remained within 1 m of their settlement site for at least
   the first 36 d on continuous reef, while known individuals of other
   species also moved little during this period, suggesting that
   disappearances were likely to be due to mortality. Mortality of recruits
   varied among species, years and habitats (patch vs continuous reef), and
   consequently spatial distributions of fish changed after settlement at
   the scale of 10s of metres (within-site) and several kilometres (among 8
   sites). The spatial patchiness in distributions was not consistent among
   species, sites or years, suggesting that spatial variation in substrate
   did not have a major effect on settlement Variation at this scale. These
   results show that the settlement signal may be obscured in the first few
   weeks post-settlement, and that less-frequent censuses, commonly used as
   proxies for high-frequency monitoring of settlement, may not accurately
   hindcast spatial or temporal patterns of settlement.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the echinoid Paracentrotus lividus have undergone
   spectacular population fluctuations over the last 40 yr at Lough Hyne,
   SW Ireland, Censuses in 2000 and 2001, reported here, show no
   individuals present in the South Basin of Lough Hyne, for what is
   believed to be, the first time since observations began in the late
   1920s. As with many echinoids, R lividus was considered to have a
   pivotal role in benthic ecology through control of algae by grazing, The
   discontinuation of P. lividus in South Basin of Lough Hyne is
   significant for 3 reasons. First, the database was 1 of the longest
   running censuses of a discrete echinoid population anywhere, Second,
   some corresponding environmental and population size structure data had
   been recorded over several decades. Third, P lividus was very important
   in structuring the shallow benthic community of the oldest marine
   reserve in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Ice algae, phytoplankton, zooplankton and the vertical fluxes of
   chloropigments and particulate organic carbon (POC) were monitored from
   May to June/July of 1992, 1994 and 1995 under the ice of Barrow Strait
   (Canadian Arctic Archipelago), Large interannual differences in the
   timing, magnitude and nature of vertical fluxes were driven by
   meteorological events that controlled snow cover and by differences in
   zooplankton assemblages. In 1992, ice algae released from the ice matrix
   were intensely recycled by the exceptionally abundant calanoid
   Pseudocalanus acuspes, The persistent snow cover delayed the
   phytoplankton bloom until after the ice break-up in July. Ice algae were
   abruptly released and sank rapidly to depth following early rain in late
   May 1994 and a heat-wave in early June 1995. In both years, the early
   removal of snow triggered an under-ice phytoplankton bloom and strong
   downward fluxes of POC and chloropigments (13.7 gC m(-2), 381 mg
   chloropigments m(-2) in 1994), In the absence of nutrient limitation,
   under-ice fluxes represented a net addition to the annual flux of POC.
   The analysis of local climate from 1950 to 1995 suggests that strong and
   early under-ice fluxes of biogenic carbon in spring may become more
   frequent under the climatic conditions anticipated by general
   circulation models.}},

Abstract = {{During recent decades, environmental conditions have deteriorated in the
   Black Sea. Population explosions of phytoplankton and jellyfish have
   become frequent and several fish stocks have collapsed. In this study,
   literature sources and long-term data are explored in order to find
   empirical evidence for ecosystem effects of fishing. Inverse trends of
   decreasing predators, increasing planktivorous fish, decreasing
   zooplankton and increasing phytoplankton biomass are revealed. Increased
   phytoplankton biomass provoked decreasing transparency and nutrient
   content in surface water, A massive development of jellyfish during the
   1970s and 1980s had a great impact on consumption and consequent
   decrease in zooplankton. The turning point for these changes occurred in
   the early 1970s, when industrial fishing started and stocks of pelagic
   predators (bonito, mackerel, bluefish, dolphins) became severely
   depleted. A `trophic cascade' is, invoked as a mechanism to explain
   observed changes. According to this hypothesis, reduction in apex
   predators decreases consumer control and leads to higher abundance of
   planktivorous fish. The increased consumption by planktivorous fish
   causes a consequent decline in zooplankton biomass, which reduces
   grazing pressure on phytoplankton and allows its standing crop to
   increase. The effects of fishing and eutrophication are explored using a
   dynamic mass-balance model, A balanced model is built using 15
   ecological groups including bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton,
   protozoa, ctenophores, medusae, chaetognaths, fishes and dolphins.
   Ecosystem dynamics are simulated over 30 yr, assuming alternative
   scenarios of increasing fishing pressure and eutrophication, The changes
   in simulated biomass are similar in direction and magnitude to observed
   data from long-term monitoring. The cascade pattern is explained by the
   removal of predators and its effect on trophic interactions, while the
   inclusion of eutrophication effects leads to biomass increase in all
   groups. The present study demonstrates that the combination of
   uncontrolled fisheries and eutrophication can cause important
   alterations in the structure and dynamics of a large marine ecosystem.
   These findings may provide insights for ecosystem management, suggesting
   that conserving and restoring natural stocks of fish and marine mammals
   can contribute greatly to sustaining viable marine ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of endpoints or metrics are commonly employed in
   pollution monitoring situations but, to date, there have been very few
   experimental field studies aimed at assessing links between a putative
   pollutant and established soft sediment assemblages, We carried out a
   manipulative field experiment whereby intact assemblages were
   transplanted from control areas to sites adjacent to drains discharging
   secondary treated sewage effluent at 3 intertidal outfall locations in
   Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia. We found that the ability of
   different measures to detect impacts varied, although multivariate
   methods were able to discriminate the effects of treatment, and
   population level measures tended to be more sensitive than assemblage
   level measures of abundance, biomass and diversity. Integrated measures,
   such as average individual biomass, were found to provide a sensitive
   detection tool plus an insight into the biological consequences of
   observed changes. We consider our findings in the light of conceptual
   models of pollution-induced change in soft sediment assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Two sets of observations were made on the distribution of
   Pseudo-nitzschia taxa in a fjord in the San Juan Islands, Washington,
   USA, From May 21 to 31, 1996, we observed the spatio-temporal
   distribution of a dense bloom of P. fraudulenta. Microscopic
   observations of live material were compared to physical-optical
   water-column structure, currents and wind. At the start of the study,
   dense concentrations of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were observed directly at
   the surface. Optical profiles indicated that most cells were
   concentrated in a thin layer at similar to5 m depth, which appeared to
   be contiguous throughout the sound. Several days later, sustained winds
   forced a plume of lighter water over the surface of the sound,
   displacing the original water mass, with its entrained flora, to depth.
   The resulting near-bottom thin layer persisted for several days, and
   contained >10(6) Pseudonitzschia spp. cells l(-1). Microscopic
   examination of live cells from the deep layer revealed that colonies
   were alive and motile. In 1996 and again in 1998, we observed P.
   pseudodelicatissima living within colonies of Chaetoceros socialis.
   Water-column thin layers, near-bottom thin layers and populations of
   Pseudo-nitzschia spp. within C. socialis colonies could easily escape
   detection by routine monitoring procedures, and may be a potential
   source of unexplained toxicity events.}},

Pages = {{239-249}},
Abstract = {{Both surface texture and littorinid grazing are known to influence the
   establishment of many shallow-water benthic hard-bottom communities.
   However, the effects of these factors and their interactions have not
   yet been investigated in a quantifiable manner. This investigation aims
   to assess the interactive effect of both factors in a strictly
   standardized manner. Natural recruitment by diatoms, the barnacle
   Balanus improvisus and the tube-building polychaete Polydora sp. was
   monitored under a 2-factorial treatment: grazing by the periwinkle
   Littorina littorea (Factor 1; 2 levels: I or no snails per plate) on
   artificial recruitment plates of different initial surface rugosities
   (Factor 2; 5 levels: smooth, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 mm rugosity elements), In
   the absence of grazers, barnacle recruitment decreased with increasing
   initial rugosity, polychaete recruitment peaked at intermediate
   rugosities, and diatoms exhibited contrasting recruitment patterns in an
   in vitro and an in situ experiment. When preferred recruitment sites
   coincided for Polydora and B. improvisus, a competition for space could
   be inferred from a negative correlation between the 2 species. However,
   when the overlap of requirements weakened on the 5 rugosities, the
   relationship was positive, but was not statistically significant.
   Grazing efficiency by L. littorea depended on initial rugosity,
   generally showing minimum values on intermediate rugosities which is
   attributable to a mismatch between radula dimensions and surface
   structures in these rugosity classes. Additionally, grazing effects
   tended to increase with higher prey densities. As all factors-initial
   rugosity, grazing, colonizer species-interact with each other, the
   outcome of recruitment under combined factors is difficult to predict
   from single factor effects.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, Se, Mn, Mo, fig, Cd, Cr, Ag, Pb, Sr and V
   were determined in skins of Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli) of the
   Pacific coast truei-type population (PT population) (N = 45), and the
   Sea of Japan-Okhotsk dalli-type population (JD population) (N = 31) from
   the northern waters of Japan. Cutaneous Hg concentrations in both PT and
   JD populations were significantly correlated with age, indicating a
   possible alternative method of age estimation. A significant correlation
   was also noted between Hg concentrations in skin and liver, suggesting
   that biopsy samples of skin can provide a non-lethal surrogate for
   monitoring Hg contamination in this species. Trace element accumulation
   patterns differed strongly between PT and JD populations, when analyzed
   by principal component analysis, suggesting these patterns could be
   utilized as non-lethal tracers of population identification. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Chemolithotrophic nitrite oxidizers were enriched from five different
   soils including freshwater marsh, permafrost, garden, agricultural, and
   desert soils and monitored during the cultivation procedure. Immunoblot
   analysis was used to identify the nitrite oxidizing organisms with
   monoclonal antibodies, which recognize the key enzyme of nitrite
   oxidation in a genus-specific reaction {[}Bartosch et al. (1999) Appl
   Environ Microbiol 65:4126-4133]. The morphological characteristics of
   the enriched nitrite oxidizers were additionally studied using
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence microscopy. By
   means of the antibodies and TEM analysis Nitrospira could be clearly
   identified in enrichment cultures derived from freshwater marsh and from
   permafrost soil. Nitrospira cells were enriched simultaneously with
   cells of the genus Nitrobacter when nitrite concentrations of 0.2 g of
   NaNO2 L-1 were used. However, in enrichment cultures containing 2 g of
   NaNO2 L-1 Nitrobacter was exclusively detected. During fluorescence
   microscopic observations of DAPI stained samples microcolonies were
   found in enrichment cultures from freshwater marsh, permafrost, garden,
   and agricultural soil. They had a similar morphology to Nitrospira-like
   microcolonies from activated sludge. In conclusion, Nitrospira seems to
   be not only a common aquatic but also a usual soil bacterium.}},

Abstract = {{The resilience of compost systems to perturbation is usually attributed
   to the highly active and diverse microbial population. Composting is
   characterized by distinct temperature changes that are associated with a
   succession of microbial communities adapted to the prevailing
   temperature. The temperature fluctuations are spatially and temporally
   variable. The transition between mesophilic and thermophilic communities
   can result in loss of degradation efficiency. We tested the resilience
   of microbial communities to temperature fluctuations in laboratory
   reactors containing tree bark and pulverized wood amended with pot ale
   liquor, a waste by-product of the whisky manufacturing process. The
   laboratory reactors were operated in fixed temperature mode at
   50degreesC, 35degreesC, and 20degreesC, in three replicates of each
   treatment, from which COD, suspended solids, BOD and pH of the resultant
   leachate were monitored on a daily basis. After running at fixed
   temperatures for 45 days, the reactors, initially operated at 50, 35 and
   20degreesC, were switched to 20, 50 and 35degreesC, respectively. A
   further temperature switch was made after 90 days so that, at the
   conclusion of the experiment after 135 days, each triplicate set of
   incubators had experienced a 45-day period at each of the three
   temperature settings.
   Microbial community structure, measured using phospholipid fatty acid
   analysis, showed that communities at different temperatures were quite
   distinct. The communities conditioned at low temperature adapted to the
   higher temperature imposed and were indistinguishable from other
   thermophilic populations.
   In contrast, the thermophilic communities that had been conditioned at
   high temperature and switched to low temperature evolved a mesophilic
   community that was distinct from the mesophilic communities previously
   conditioned at low temperature. The loss in process efficiency after the
   thermophilic phase may therefore be limited by the recovery of surviving
   populations and/or by slow recolonisation from low-temperature zones.}},

   characterise Meloidogyne spp. In this study these regions have been
   amplified from M. mayaguensis, M. javanica, M. arenaria, M. incognita

   from the 63 by repeat region of M. mayaguensis unlike M. javanica, M.
   arenaria, and M. incognita that exhibit hypervariability in this region.
   Meloidogyne mayaguensis is a widely distributed root-knot nematode with
   the potential to cause great economic damage. These molecular
   diagnostics can be used for accurate identification of M. mayaguensis

Abstract = {{Nest success, the proportion of clutches resulting in one or more
   fledglings, is a key indicator for assessing the effect of management on
   bird populations. However, the figures reported for New Zealand
   populations are usually ``apparent nest success{''}, the number of
   successful nests divided by the total number found. Apparent nest
   success invariably overestimates the true success rate, and the degree
   of bias depends on the population and monitoring regime. Consequently,
   apparent nest success rates cannot be reliably compared. We used
   Stanley's (2000) method for estimating stage-specific daily survival
   probabilities for New Zealand robin (Petroica australis) nests at
   Tiritiri Matangi, Paengaroa, Boundary Stream and Pureora. We show how
   Stanley's method can be used to eliminate biases, to calculate point
   estimates and confidence intervals for nest success, and to model the
   factors affecting nest success. At Pureora, where monitoring was
   extremely intensive, the apparent overall nest success (39\%) was close
   to that estimated from daily survival probabilities (37\%). Apparent
   nest success rates were extremely biased for the other populations due
   to less intensive monitoring, with the bias exacerbated by changes in
   survival probabilities with season and/or stage of the nesting cycle.
   Modelling the data showed that failure rates were: (1) higher early in
   the breeding season for at least some mainland populations, (2)
   different for incubation and nestling stages, with the pattern depending
   on the season (early or late) and type of predator, and (3)
   substantially lowered by predator control at Pureora, with the impact
   varying between sites and stages. Taking these factors into account, the
   estimated nest success (and 95\% confidence limits) was 60\% (4474) at
   Pureora after predator control, 47\% (23-73) at Boundary Stream, 37\%
   (26-49) at Tiritiri Matangi, 25\% (11 48) at Paengaroa, and 25\% (17-35)
   at Pureora without predator control.}},

Abstract = {{Lesser short-tailed bats (Mystacina tuberculata) feed on arthropod taxa
   known to consume 1080 baits. Thus, they may be vulnerable to secondary
   poisoning after control operations for brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula) using aerially broadcast 1080 baits. Short-tailed bat
   mortality was monitored during I I days after 1080 baits were broadcast
   over their winter foraging area. Monitoring involved catching a sample
   of 269 bats as they arrived at a roost after foraging, then holding them
   in captivity for 48 hours. None of the captured bats displayed any
   symptoms of 1080 poisoning. Power analysis indicates that there was a !
   0.95 probability of detecting mortality when the actual mortality rate
   was above 11.1 deaths per thousand foraging flights. Uncertainties in
   assumptions about the bats' behaviour mean that the overall population
   mortality corresponding to this minimum detectable mortality rate may
   range from 5.4 to 28.4\%, with a best estimate of 14.4\%. Although it
   can be concluded that this 1080 operation probably did not cause major
   mortality of short-tailed bats, several replicate trials are required
   before a generalised conclusion can be drawn about the fate of
   short-tailed bats following aerial 1080 operations. More information
   about short-tailed bat population demography is required to assess the
   impact of 1080 operations on population viability.}},

Abstract = {{The condition of 79 plants of the loranthaceous mistletoe Tupeia
   antarctica in a podocarp-hardwood forest in the central North Island,
   New Zealand, was monitored over 4 years during a period of increasing
   possum density, following previous possum control. Mistletoe comprised
   1.2\% of total possum diet during the three years following possum
   control. Incidence of possum browse on mistletoe plants increased from
   2.6\% of plants when the trap-catch index of possum density was < 3\%,
   to 75.9\% of plants when trap-catch rates reached 4.6\%. Mistletoe
   foliage cover declined from 49.8\% to 15.6\% and mean plant size
   declined by about 55\% over the same period. The mistletoe population
   was dominated by plants with large haustoria, located in heavily shaded
   locations in the lower crown of their Carpodetus serratus hosts. Most
   plants established more than 20 years ago, and the current potential for
   recruitment of new individuals into the population is severely limited
   by possum browsing and the senescent nature of the mistletoe population.
   Intensive management of host crowns and possum populations will be
   necessary to ensure the long-term viability of mistletoe at the study
   site.}},

Abstract = {{In the first quantitative study of an endemic New Zealand aphid, the
   only known field populations of the rare Paradoxaphis plagianthi were
   monitored for two years from 1999 to 2001. The species appears to be
   anholocyclic, persisting viviparously throughout the year on its
   deciduous host tree, the lowland ribbonwood (Plagianthus regius). Local
   aphid abundance increased rapidly in spring as new leaves appeared, but
   collapsed abruptly in November, probably due to dispersal and a decline
   in resource quality. Numbers then remained low until leaf senescence in
   late autumn, when they increased again to a smaller peak. Aphids
   persisted on plump terminal buds for the short time in winter when host
   trees were completely leafless. Though several colonisation events were
   observed in late spring, these were generally unsuccessful in
   establishing new populations, and local colony extinction was common.
   The apparent rarity of P. plagianthi suggests it could be threatened by
   introduced predators and competitors, or climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of larvae of Herpetogramma licarsisalis (tropical grass
   webworm (TGW)) in pasture on the Aupouri Peninsula in Northland, New
   Zealand, was confirmed in March 1999. A delineation survey undertaken in
   late March 1999 found an infested area of approximately 37 000 ha, of
   which 4450 ha was in dairying. The establishment of TGW in the area has
   been confirmed by ongoing monitoring of populations from 1999 to the
   present. Populations decline to extremely low numbers over the winter
   months with the main pasture damage period in early autumn
   (March/April). Infestations to date have been mainly confined to kikuyu
   pastures. In 1999 and 2002 visual estimations were made of pasture
   damage by TGW. The implications of this damage are discussed within the
   context of management practices and economic constraints for dairy
   farming in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Pots of orchid-growing media augmented with pollen-cap mite, Tyrophagus
   neiswanderi, and its predator, Hypoaspis sp., were drenched with
   carbaryl, deltametrin, dimethoate and methiocarb to compare their
   efficacy for mite control with natural predation. Mite populations were
   monitored by heat extraction from 50 ml of potting media on days 0, 2, 7
   and 14 after treatment and compared with water treated controls. All
   pesticide treatments initially reduced pollen-cap mite numbers (P<0.05),
   but after 14 days only methiocarb sustained this reduction to a similar
   level achieved by the predation of Hypoaspis sp. in the controls.
   Dimethoate gave the least effective control of pollen-cap mite and
   caused the greatest reduction in Hypoasis sp. populations. The ability
   of these four pesticides, plus taufluvalinate, acephate and
   methamidophos, to reduce movement of pollen-cap mite was assessed.
   Flower stems (350 mm), with double-sided sticky tape encircling the top,
   were dipped in pesticide and stood in media with pollen-cap mite. After
   48 h only methiocarb reduced (P<0.05) the number of mites moving up the

Abstract = {{The evolution of a showy floral display as an advertisement to
   pollinators could simultaneously advertise the availability of resources
   to pre-dispersal seed-predators. The hypotheses tested here are that the
   incidence of seed predation by bud-infesting insect larvae in capitula
   of Asteraceae is positively related to (1) capitulum size among species,
   (2) capitulum size within species, (3) capitulum lifespan, and (4) the
   degree of flowering asynchrony on individual plants. Three populations
   of each of 20 common herbaceous species of Asteraceae from disturbed
   ground and grassland habitats were monitored for the presence of
   pre-dispersal, seed-eating insect larvae. Mean capitulum size
   (receptacle width) of each species was measured. In a sub-set of eight
   species, individual capitula were tagged to determine their flowering
   phenology and lifespan (from anthesis to seed shedding). From these data
   an index of flowering synchrony on individual plants was derived. Among
   species, the incidence of larval infestation increased with capitulum
   size. Small-flowered species such as Achillea millefolium were largely
   free of bud-infesting larvae, whilst large-flowered species such as
   Arctium minus were heavily infested. In three cases investigated in
   greater detail, bud infestation was found to increase with capitulum
   size within species, suggesting a potential for natural selection to
   favour smaller capitula. No relationship was found between infestation
   levels and either capitulum lifespan or degree of flowering synchrony,
   and there was no evidence that the relationship between capitulum size
   and infestation was confounded by correlations with these other
   features. The results support hypotheses I and 2, but not 3 and 4. It is
   suggested that the characteristic capitulum size of each species may
   represent a trade-off between the opposing selection pressures of
   pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated correlations among climatic variability,
   population age structure, and seedling survival of a dominant Sonoran
   Desert tree, Cercidium microphyllum (foothill paloverde), at Tucson,
   Arizona, USA. A major goal was to determine whether wet years promote
   seedling establishment and thereby, determine population structure.
   Plant age was estimated from basal circumference for a sample of 980
   living and dead trees in twelve 0.5-ha plots. Ages ranged from 1 to 181
   years. Age frequency distribution showed that the population is in
   decline. Most (51.2\%) of the 814 living trees were 40-80 years old;
   only 6.5\% were younger than 20 years. The average age of the 166 dead
   trees was 78 years. Fifty-nine percent of dead trees were aged 60-100
   years. Survival of newly emerged seedlings was monitored for 7 years in
   a 557-m(2) permanent plot. Mean survival in the 1st year of life was
   1.7\%. Only 2 of 1,008 seedlings lived longer than 1 year. Length of
   survival was not correlated with rainfall. Residual regeneration, an
   index of the difference between predicted arid observed cohort size,
   showed that regeneration was high during the first half of the twentieth
   century and poor after the mid-1950s. Trends in regeneration did not
   reflect interannual variation in seasonal temperature or rain before
   1950, that is, in the years before urban warming. Taken together, the
   seedling study and the regeneration analysis suggest that local
   population dynamics reflect biotic factors to such an extent that
   population age structure might not always be a reliable clue to past
   climatic influences.}},

Abstract = {{Geographically varying rodent dynamics may be due to specific landscape
   effects or to regional variation. Two common vole species (Clethrionomys
   glareolus and Microtus agrestis), their main predators and their impact
   on some important food items were monitored in Sweden on forest
   clearcuts in two different landscape types, situated in two different
   regions with different climatic conditions. Censuses, with 10-16
   clearcuts in each landscape and both landscapes in the two regions, were
   designed to permit analyses of variance of the effects of landscape
   composition and region on dynamics and species interactions. Region had
   a far greater influence than landscape on vole numbers, on the
   proportions of generalist and specialist predators and on the winter
   browsing of bark of indigenous and experimental woody plants as well on
   seed consumption in experimental supplies. The findings indicated an
   influence of the depth and quality of the snow cover on the predation
   rates by generalist and specialist predators. However, there were also
   clear signs of food limitation in the snow-rich areas. Such areas had
   fewer generalist predators, which probably meant less directly
   density-dependent predation. Thus, lack of high-quality food may put a
   brake on population growth in climatically harsh regions, permitting
   increasing populations of specialist predators such as small mustelids
   to subsequently over-utilise their main prey and potentially cause
   prolonged low densities. Snow conditions may affect numbers and
   interactions both within habitats, landscapes and regions. Thus, to more
   fully understand rodent dynamics, small-scale movements and interactions
   of individuals in relation to the main large-scale factor(s) of various
   regions need to be examined.}},

   species composition, the forest types differed in the abundance of dead

   each forest type were monitored for behavioural activity, use of tree
   species and vertical dimension (ground vs. tree) after fledging (from
   late May to late July 1998). We found significant difference in
   behavioural activity among the forest types. For adult jays the two
   dominating behavioural categories were food search and sitting, whereas
   for juveniles sitting and resting were the most common activities. Adult
   Siberian Jays allocated relatively more time for food search in the
   spruce-dominated forests juveniles spent relatively more time sitting
   and less time resting in spruce-dominated forest. Adult jays used tree
   species proportional to availability for food search in both forest
   types. Birch was used more than expected by abundance for sitting by
   adult jays in spruce-dominated forest, whereas spruce was used
   disproportionately for sitting in pine-dominated forest.
   Spruce-dominated forest may provide more diverse feeding opportunities
   than pine-dominated forest, and reduced visibility in spruce-dominated
   forest may offer better concealment from avian predators. The strong
   preference for spruce in pine-dominated forest suggest that spruce is an
   important cover component in Siberian Jay territories.}},

Title = {{Assessing the lifetime consequences of plant-animal interactions for the

Abstract = {{Interactions with animals are potentially important in shaping the life
   histories of plants. However, we still largely lack the quantitative
   information that is necessary to compare plant-animal interactions and
   plant life histories. This is because most studies have focused on only
   a single interaction and a single component of fitness. This review
   suggests a protocol for how plant-animal interactions, as well as other,
   interactions can be quantitatively investigated.
   I review results from the forest herb Lathyrus vernus to examine how
   plant performance is influenced by mollusc damage of shoot buds,
   vertebrate grazing, leaf damage, pre-dispersal seed predation, flower
   herbivory and pollinator visitation. More specifically I ask: (1) What
   are the effects of these interactions on components of plant fitness?
   (2) How do such effects translate into total fitness? (3) Do trade-offs
   among components of plant fitness influence the net effect of animals?
   (4) Are antagonistic and mutualistic interactions influenced by the same
   plant traits?
   The results illustrate why it is often necessary to monitor plants over
   several seasons and over all life cycle phases to assess the total
   effects of environmental factors. In L. vernus many components of
   fitness were affected by multiple interactions with animals. A large
   proportion of these effects was carried over to subsequent seasons and
   could only be detected after one or two seasons. Assessing the effects
   on overall performance in perennial plants is particularly difficult
   because fitness components have very different influence on total
   fitness. The matrix model approach used to estimate the effect of
   herbivores, seed predators and pollinators on L. vernus provides one
   possible way to make such assessments for organisms with complex life
   cycles. The results show that the cryptic damage of emerging shoots has
   the largest negative effects on total fitness. Correlations between
   different components are an essential feature of many life histories and
   must be incorporated into demographic models if we want to assess the
   net effect of environmental factors. In L. vernus costs of reproduction
   were present and demographic modelling showed that the positive effects
   of an increased seed production after additional hand-pollination on
   total fitness was completely offset by poorer performance in the
   following year.Lastly, this study provides an example of how optimal
   trait values can be assessed when traits influence several fitness
   components and several interactions. In L. vernus a higher number of
   flowers was correlated to both an increased fruit set and an increased
   risk of grazing damage and these effects were, in turn, carried over to
   the next season. The results clearly illustrate the limitations of
   inferences about phenotypic selection pressures that are based on single
   fitness components or single interactions.
   Taken together the results for L. vernus show that the selective
   pressure constituted by a given amount of animal interference is highly
   dependent on the context, in terms of both plant life history and other
   interactions. A life cycle approach like the one outlined in this study
   may avoid several problems and provide the basis for assessments of the
   total effects of animals on plants. Such an approach must be based on
   in-depth studies of plants.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of esfenvalerate (84 g litre(-1) EC; Asana XL) at 7.0 g AI
   ha(-1) on broccoli was tested against the flea beetle, Phyllotreta
   cruciferae Goeze (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera) and the imported cabbage
   worm, Pieris rapae L (Pieridae: Lepidoptera) under field conditions.
   Insect populations were monitored before and after treatment. Periodic
   sweep-net collections and examination of the leaves in treated and
   untreated broccoli plots revealed mean reductions of P cruciferae levels
   of nearly 98\% 1 week post-application compared with untreated plots.
   The residual toxicity of esfenvalerate was also effective for 2 weeks in
   reducing population density of P rapae by 69\% on broccoli leaves. The
   impact of esfenvalerate on feeding damage to broccoli leaves was
   established by counting the number of feeding holes made by P cruciferae
   on spring broccoli and P rapae on fall broccoli. As the leaf area
   ingested increased, a linear relationship was seen between the number of
   holes and number of insects. Results indicated that forage destruction
   by the two pests was significantly reduced by esfenvalerate application.
   Esfenvalerate was extracted from broccoli at 1 h and 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14
   days post-application for residue analysis. Residues on spring broccoli
   were 12.2, 5.2 and 2.9 mug cm(-2) on the leaves and 0.13, 0.05 and 0.02
   mug g(-1) on the heads at 1 h, 1 and 3 days, respectively. Only trace
   levels (0.001 mug g(-1)) were detected in/on the heads 14 days after
   spraying. On the basis of half-life (T-1/2) values, persistence of
   esfenvalerate on spring broccoli leaves (T-1/2 = 1 day) was shorter than
   on fall broccoli (T-1/2 = 1.6 days). T-1/2 values were 2.1 and 3.6 days
   on spring and fall broccoli heads, respectively. The implications of
   these residue levels on re-entry times into treated fields are
   discussed. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Fingerprints of excitation spectra of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence can
   be used to differentiate `spectral groups' of microalgae in vivo and in
   situ in, for example, vertical profiles within a few seconds. The
   investigated spectral groups of algae (green group, Chlorophyta; blue,
   Cyanobacteria; brown, Heterokontophyta, Haptophyta, Dinophyta; mixed,
   Cryptophyta) are each characterised by a specific composition of
   photosynthetic antenna pigments and, consequently, by a specific
   excitation spectrum of the Chl fluorescence. Particularly relevant are
   Chl a, Chl c, phycocyanobilin, phycoerythrobilin, fucoxanthin and
   peridinin. A laboratory-based instrument and a submersible instrument
   were constructed containing light-emitting diodes to excite Chl
   fluorescence in five distinct wavelength ranges. Norm spectra were
   determined for the four spectral algal groups (several species per
   group). Using these norm spectra and the actual five-point excitation
   spectrum of a water sample, a separate estimate of the respective Chl
   concentration is rapidly obtained for each algal group. The results of
   dilution experiments are presented. In vivo and in situ measurements are
   compared with results obtained by HPLC analysis. Depth profiles of the
   distribution of spectral algal groups taken over a time period of few
   seconds are shown. The method for algae differentiation described here
   opens up new research areas, monitoring and supervision tasks related to
   photosynthetic primary production in aquatic environments.}},

Abstract = {{The internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear rRNA gene was used
   to discriminate among the marine raphidophyte species Chattonella
   antiqua, Chattonella subsalsa, Fibrocapsa japonica, Heterosigma
   akashiwo, and Olisthodiscus luteus. These microalgae can be difficult to
   identify from natural water samples, owing to their fragile nature and
   pleomorphic morphology. Several of these species have been associated
   with massive fin-fish kills throughout the world, and positive
   identification is therefore of great economic importance.
   Species-specific diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment
   sizes resulting from three-primer amplification reactions can
   reproducibly detect as few as five cells per fixed sample and as few as
   one cell from fresh or frozen samples. Recently, an active area of
   ecological research has been retrospective studies from archival
   material to determine population dynamics and species diversity. The PCR
   primers were successfully used with archived material containing either
   formalin or Lugol's iodine, as well as with fresh cultures. Because of
   the existence of other techniques more conducive to monitoring for
   aquaculture, this assay was developed primarily as a research tool for
   identification of Raphidophyceae from both cultured and archived field
   samples where cell integrity has been compromised. It has proved to be a
   valuable technique for detection and discrimination among marine
   Raphidophyceae, especially when cells cannot be identified
   morphologically and fixation methods have destroyed cellular RNA
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Herbicide safeners manipulate herbicide selectivity by enhancing the
   activities of detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione transferases
   (GSTs) and cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases (CYPs) in cereal crops. As
   part of a study examining the importance of O-glucosyltransferases
   (OGTs) in pesticide metabolism in hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L.), seedlings were grown in the presence of dichlormid, a
   safener used in maize and cloquintocet mexyl, a wheat safener. The
   efficacy of the treatments was confirmed by monitoring changes in the
   abundance of phi and tau class GSTs. OGT activities in the root and
   shoot tissue were assayed using phenolics of natural and xenobiotic
   origin to determine if they were enhanced by safeners. Cloquintocet
   mexyl selectively increased OGT activities toward xenobiotics
   (4-nitrophenol and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol) and flavonoids, (quercetin,
   luteolin, genistein and coumestrol) in both the roots and shoots.
   However, OGT activity towards simple phenols and phenylpropanoids was
   not enhanced by cloquintocet mexyl. Dichlormid was a much weaker
   enhancer of OGT activity, with the same subset of OGT activities
   increased as determined with cloquintocet mexyl, but with the effect
   being largely restricted to the roots. OGT activities were also
   determined in black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides L.), an agronomically
   important weed in wheat. Two populations of black-grass differing in
   their sensitivity to herbicides were analysed. The population Peldon,
   which is resistant to multiple classes of herbicides due in part to the
   elevated expression of CYPs and GSTs active in herbicide detoxification,
   contained higher OGT activities than herbicide sensitive black-grass.
   Unlike wheat, treatment with cloquintocet mexyl or dichlormid, had no
   effect on OGT activities in either black-grass population. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Isolates of Puccinia triticina were obtained from wheat leaf collections
   made by cooperators throughout the United States and from surveys of
   wheat fields and nurseries in the Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and Gulf
   Coast states in 1999. Pathogenic races were determined from
   virulence/avirulence phenotypes on 14 host lines that are near-isogenic
   for leaf rust resistance. We found 58 races among 1,180 isolates in
   1999. As in previous surveys, regional race distribution patterns showed
   that the central United States is a single epidemiological unit distinct
   from the eastern United States. The distinctive racial composition of
   collections from the Southeast, Northeast, and Ohio Valley indicates
   that populations of P. triticina in those areas are not closely
   connected, suggesting epidemics originate from localized overwintering
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{The New Jersey Vector Surveillance program monitored mosquito
   populations for both eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus in
   New Jersey during 2001. Eastern equine encephalitis first appeared in
   Culiseta melanura at the Dennisville site on July 17. A total of 19
   isolations were made from that species at 4 of New Jersey's 5 study
   sites before the surveillance effort ended in mid-October. The first
   equine case of the season was confirmed August 29 indicating that
   eastern equine encephalitis transcended the amplification cycle and
   reached epizootic proportions in 2001. New Jersey's West Nile virus plan
   for 2001 included a Rutgers initiative as well as a county initiative to
   increase the total number of mosquitoes tested for surveillance
   purposes. A total of 357 West Nile virus positives were detected from
   the 4936 pools that were tested during the season. Data from the
   surveillance effort indicated that although West Nile virus was
   widespread in the state of New Jersey, the virus was most common in the
   urban corridor between New York City and Philadelphia. Culex pipiens
   functioned as the primary amplification vector in all areas of the
   state. Positives were obtained from numerous mammalian feeding species
   that appeared to be serving as bridge vectors in the cycle. Ochlerotatus
   triseriatus and Oc. japonicus had the highest minimum infection rates
   values among mammalian feeding species suggesting that backyard mosquito
   production contributes significantly to maintenance of this recently
   introduced pathogen. The inclusion of county mosquito control agencies
   in the collection and processing of West Nile virus was an overwhelming
   success.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroductions of Delmarva fox squirrels (Sciurus niger cinereus) to
   suitable habitat have been a recovery tool used for this endangered
   species. In Maryland, we attempted reintroductions at 11 sites beginning
   in 1978. The last reintroduction was completed in 1992. At each site,
   8-42 individuals were released during spring or fall over a 1-3 year
   period. Attempts were made to release an equal number of males and
   females. Monitoring at reintroduction sites by live-trapping has
   documented recruitment and establishment of populations at 9 sites.
   Criteria used for determining population establishment follows that of
   the Delmarva Fox Squirrel Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
   1993). Because 7 of these populations were established with <24
   individuals, supplemental releases of Delmarva fox squirrels were
   conducted to bolster genetic diversity. This paper summarizes the
   history of Delmarva fox squirrel reintroductions in Maryland, provides
   the results of recent live-trapping efforts at the sites, and discusses
   success of these efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Despite numerous museum records and published range maps, gaps exist in
   current knowledge of the abundance and distribution of many amphibian
   species. Furthermore, because of the unique life histories among
   amphibians, several techniques conducted across several diurnal and
   seasonal time scales are needed to detect species presence. We conducted
   surveys at fixed points within forests on a military land base in
   east-central Mississippi to quantify amphibian richness using anuran
   call counts and time-constrained area searches, 1998-2000.
   Concomitantly, we completely enclosed 3 ephemeral pools with drift
   fence-pitfall arrays to monitor seasonal use by amphibians and gain
   further knowledge of local species richness. We detected 21 species of
   amphibians among 4 habitat types using anuran call counts and area
   searches at fixed points. Species richness at fixed points by habitat
   type was 12, 16, 17, and 9 for pine, pine-hardwood, riparian, and beaver
   (Castor canadensis) wetlands, respectively. Mean species richness by
   point ranged from 2.71 (SE = 2.52) in pines to 7.83 (SE = 0.75) in
   riparian hardwoods. Data from enclosed breeding pools added 2 additional
   species to the overall richness of the land base. We also conducted area
   searches away from fixed points and added 2 more species to overall
   richness. Thus, amphibian richness for the land base was 25 species
   though no technique detected >17 species alone. We documented 9 new
   counties records, including pine woods treefrog (Hyla femoralis) and
   four-toed salamander (Hemidactylium scutatum), which were extensions of
   documented and predicted ranges. We recommend that natural resource
   managers in the Southeast generate a list of all potential species in
   the area, based on historical and current information, then develop a
   sampling protocol that would confirm or deny the presence of each
   species based on specific habitat requirements and life histories.
   Furthermore, research technicians should be trained in amphibian
   identification in case new species are detected, and vouchers should be
   collected when new records are identified.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1996, queen conch (Strombas gigas) density, distribution by
   benthic habitats; and size frequency distribution have been monitored in
   Parque Nacional del Este (PNE), southeaster Hispaniola. Delgado (1999)
   reported that queen conch are significantly more abundant in communities
   with sparse to moderate seagrass benthic coverage (< 30\%). He also
   reported a marked decline in overall queen conch abundance from 1996 to
   1997. As a recommendation from his findings, the government of the
   Dominican Republic declared Canal de Catuano as a permanent closed area
   for conch fishing as of 1999 and additionally implement a closed season
   for the fishery between 1 July and 31 October for the country.
   The purpose of this study was to continue ongoing studies of annual
   changes in queen conch population structure in a large marine lagoon
   within the park, using a stratified sampling design based upon benthic
   community type distribution. Annual surveys have focused on the density
   and location of juvenile aggregations, and the presence of adults as
   potential spawning stock by habitat available in the lagoon. The results
   obtained since 1996 to 2000 are part of a database that also contains
   information from historical conch populations (Torres et al. in prep)
   that once lived in the shallow waters of PNE. Shell length, width, and
   lip thickness (adults only) were collected along 50m x 5m transects
   located in different community types of the park, to determine if there
   are significant differences in conch densities during the study. These
   estimates also provide a baseline for evaluating future changes in
   population abundance and size structure relative to the recent closure
   of the park's lagoon. An annual evaluation of conch populations in PNE
   will serve as performance measures for PNE's managers.
   Annual surveys conducted by Delgado (1999) in 1996 and 1997 showed
   significant declines (orders of magnitude) in the densities of both
   juvenile and adult conch. Data collected during 2000 illustrate a
   continued decline in juvenile and adult densities, but less dramatically
   than in previous surveys. Conch density and size frequency distribution
   showed a significant difference among benthic community types in all
   years. There is no evidence of the effect of the closure of the lagoon
   from fishing or from the closed season. Continuation of annual surveys
   will help to evaluate the biological effects of the spatial and seasonal
   closures on queen conch in PNE, dependent, in part, on the ability of
   park managers to effectively implement the new regulations.}},

   require that observers collecting this data are able to accurately
   estimate the recorded size parameter. Training and testing of observers
   conducting size estimates during underwater visual surveys have
   traditionally employed very simple linear artificial targets of known
   dimensions or more complex and costly life-sized models of the organisms
   surveyed: As part of its efforts to monitor reef fish populations in the
   Florida Keys, the Florida Marine Research Institute has developed a new
   visual target type that is inexpensive to build, easy to maintain and
   deploy in-situ, and allows for almost infinite variability in target
   image size as well as accurate representation of species-specific visual
   aspects: These new targets are created by. placing images of organisms
   photocopied onto waterproof paper between two sheets of Plexiglas. A
   large variety of sizes can be generated from the same original image by
   using the photocopier to reduce or enlarge copy size. Teflon bolts and
   wingnuts are used to hold the two Plexiglas sheets together around the
   inserted images. Targets are deployed in the field using an anchor and
   float arrangement. New observers can be trained and tested with the
   images before collecting program data, and experienced observers
   retested on a regular basis. This-new target system, which should
   overcome the estimation biases associated with the use of simple linear
   target systems without incurring the high expenses of constructing
   solid, lifelike models of the organisms surveyed, should be tested and
   evaluated more thoroughly for its applicability as a training tool.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary gene flow is a major mechanism for the maintenance of
   genetic diversity. One component of gene flow is the mating system,
   which is a composite measure of selfing, mating with relatives, and
   outcrossing. Although both gene flow and mating patterns contribute to
   the ecological sustainability of populations, a focus of many forest
   management plans, these processes are often overlooked in forest
   management studies. As part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem
   Project (MOFEP) we conducted a study of mating patterns in flowering
   dogwood (Cornus florida L), an insect-pollinated tree that is abundant
   and ubiquitous under story tree of upland Missouri Ozark forests. In
   1998 and 1999, we collected fruit from over 200 Cornus florida
   individuals located in six compartments (MOFEP sites 1-6; similar
   to250-500 ha each), which were subjected to one of three management
   treatments: even-aged, uneven-aged, and no harvest. To see whether the
   management treatments influenced tree density surrounding the study
   trees, we measured and compared tree density across treatments. Because
   differential germination could reflect either genetic or environmental
   factors affecting the mating system, we measured germination success on
   a per maternal tree basis. We then measured the outcrossing rate, the
   rate of consanguineous mating (mating with relatives), and the effective
   number of pollen donors for each of the six sites and tested the
   hypotheses that both treatment and local tree density have no influence
   on these aspects of mating. Furthermore, the percent germination among
   mothers was not significantly influenced by the application of forest
   treatments. Multilocus outcrossing, t(m) (range 0.981-1.000), single
   locus outcrossing, t(s) (range 0.976-0.996), and the genetic effective
   number of pollen donors (range 4-11) did not differ among management
   treatments. For 1998, mating with relatives tended to increase with
   local density (df=1,28, F=4.07, P=0.053, 1998 only), suggesting local
   familial structure at the site level. No trend in consanguineous mating
   was observed in the data collected in 1999. The overall results show
   that the first cycle of timber harvesting had little effect on
   insect-mediated pollen movement in C. florida This lack of impact could
   be due to the fact that the treatments did not alter pollinator
   behavior. Thus, to evaluate the general impact of forest management on
   gene flow and mating in woody plants, we recommend ongoing monitoring as
   management treatments are continued and further studies on additional
   plant species.}},

Abstract = {{The Bore Drain Replacement Project (BDRP) in south-west Queensland
   provided government subsidies to land managers to convert water
   distribution systems from open earth bore drains to piped water systems,
   thereby addressing Great Artesian Basin (GAB) sustainability issues. To
   fully evaluate the benefits and costs of the project for land managers,
   both a financial benefit-cost analysis and a study of land managers'
   perceptions were conducted.
   The main benefit for land managers from bore drain replacement, was a
   substantial decrease in operating costs (mean decrease of 87\%). Results
   of the financial benefit-cost analysis showed that the mean private
   benefit to total cost ratio (Bp:CT) (0.86, at a real discount rate of
   6\%, over 10 years) was less than the break-even value of unity. The
   mean BP:CT (0.6) for land managers with less than 50\% of bore drains on
   mulga (Acacia aneura F. Muell ex. Benth) land systems was also less than
   unity, while those land managers with bore drains predominately on mulga
   land systems had a mean Bp:CT that only marginally exceeded unity (1.1).
   With a government subsidy (study mean 72\%), the private benefits to
   private cost ratio (Bp:Cp), averaged across all land managers in the
   study, was 2.25. The break-even subsidy level for land managers was
   calculated as 17\% of the total capital cost.
   Land managers perceived a number of important benefits from bore drain
   replacement that were not included in the financial benefit-cost
   analysis, due to difficulty quantifying values. These included benefits
   from changes in grazing management, increased time-savings and an
   improved quality of life. In general, there were no changes documented
   in animal productivity, native and feral animal populations, or carrying
   capacity in the 18 months since piping, although potential changes for
   the future were identified. Some land managers noted improvements to
   natural resource condition near bore drains after closure, while most
   expected little deterioration in natural resource condition near the new
   water points.
   Recommendations are made for ongoing funding support for bore drain
   replacement, including further monitoring and evaluation, with emphasis
   on conducting an economic public and private benefit-cost analysis. Land
   managers' capacity to pay, willingness to adopt change and public
   benefits of the project should be considered in cost sharing
   arrangements and determination of future government subsidy levels.}},

Title = {{Feral goats in south-western Queensland: A permanent component of the
   grazing lands}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{268-287}},
Abstract = {{Feral goats were harvested in south-western Queensland at four sites
   under two regimes (opportunistic harvesting and sustained control). We
   assessed how this impacted on their contribution to total grazing
   pressure, on soil and pasture conditions and on the economics of goat
   management. The population impact was not consistent across sites with
   the same treatment, with 62\% and 84\% reductions in numbers in the two
   northern sites (one opportunistic harvesting site and one sustained
   control site) while numbers in the southern sites essentially remained
   the same. The contribution of goats to grazing pressure ranged from 3 to
   30\%; kangaroos contributed 16-36\%; and livestock contributed 37-72\%.
   Harvest rates of feral goats calculated for each of the sites ranged
   from 17 to 41\%. There was no consistent relationship between population
   changes and the harvest rates. Seasonal conditions had greater influence
   on pasture and soil conditions than did changes in feral goat
   populations. The average cost of mustering goats (based on 34
   operations) was \$1.93 per head. Mustering costs increased markedly when
   goat density was lower 2 than 10/km(2). Average trapping costs (based on
   7 trapping programs) were \$2.08 per head. This compared with on-farm
   prices of \$16-\$25 per head in 1997. Personal circumstances and
   preferences of individual landholders were the key determinant of the
   level of control undertaken. Variability in price contributed to
   landholders being apprehensive about the viability of the goat industry.
   There are few simple tools available for landholders to estimate feral
   goat numbers and this makes effective management of total grazing
   pressure difficult.}},

   Peromyscus polionotus}},
Journal = {{REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-67}},
Abstract = {{Inbreeding effects on fitness have most often been quantified via
   juvenile mortality. However, inbred adults may suffer from inbreeding
   depression if their fertility or fecundity is compromised as a
   consequence of inbreeding. Here, the effects of inbreeding on male
   fertility in oldfield mice, Peromyscus polionotus, were examined.
   Testicular sperm concentration was assessed in 93 males, 68 of which
   were paired for breeding. Forty of the 68 paired males failed to produce
   offspring. Total testicular sperm count, sperm count (g testis)(-1), and
   testis mass all declined significantly with increasing inbreeding
   coefficient. Sperm concentration did not significantly impact
   reproductive success. Although sperm concentration in males of most
   species can decline to low levels before reproductive impairment is
   detectable, the declines in testicular sperm concentration found here
   suggest that inbreeding can affect fertility in adult males.
   Furthermore, monitoring testicular sperm concentration could provide a
   mechanism to monitor potential declines in reproductive performance
   before population-level reproductive success is irreparably impaired.
   The implications for the management of small, captive and wild
   populations may be substantial.}},

Abstract = {{Aquaculturists and their organizations can be assessed in comparison to
   other people and organizations on moral, ethical and stewardship
   criteria. This chapter considers the criticisms directed towards
   aquaculture on ethical and stewardship grounds. Ethically irresponsible
   behaviour would lead to harm to humans in terms of health, economic or
   social well-being. Irresponsible stewardship would lead to harm to
   future generations of humans or to the sustainability of natural
   resources. Charges of irresponsible actions are assessed here only as
   they relate to the role of genetics in management of the production
   system.
   Genetics plays two roles in aquaculture: monitoring and modification.
   Use of genetic monitoring is generally associated with ethical
   operations exhibiting good stewardship. The genetic modifications of
   aquacultured animals are compared to those of maize in the context of
   responsibility. Genetic technologies for modifications include selective
   breeding, inbreeding. hybridization, chromosomal manipulation,
   gynogenesis, control of sex determination, cloning and production of
   transgenics. Aquaculturists have genetic responsibility for domestic
   populations and for wild stocks that are linked genetically to cultured
   animals. A large difference exists between genetic modification
   accomplished as research and that which is applied in commercial
   operations.
   In general, commercial aquaculture has not exhibited the same drive to
   commodification of genetic resources as the crop breeding industry.
   Selection of outbreeding populations is the principal technology
   employed. Traits selected for improvement are chosen for improvement of
   yield, not for mechanization or marketing advantages. Few production
   systems use more complex genetic technologies. Genetic modifications
   appear to improve the ethical responsibility of aquaculture operations.
   The analysis of responsibility for stewardship is less clear. The
   long-term impact of genetic management of aquaculture stocks may be loss
   of genetic variation. Genetics permits economic valuation of traits, but
   no method exists for incorporation of ethical or stewardship values.
   Aquaculturists should avoid genetic modification for irresponsible
   reasons and adopt precautionary management of genetic resources.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Patzcuaro, a 97.5 km(2) lake in central Mexico, has an important
   artisanal multi-species fishery that is currently overexploited. Twelve
   fishes and one amphibian are important in the fishery, which is
   conducted largely from small wooden boats using seines, gill nets, and
   the traditional butterfly net. Fishery yields from the lake peaked in
   1988, but have declined to near record lows since then. We propose a
   management plan to restore the fishery. Key components of the plan
   include: 1) licensing and restricting the number of fishermen; 2)
   continuing a recent ban on seines and implementing limits on the number
   and mesh sizes of gill nets to allow fish to complete at least one
   spawning before they are vulnerable to harvest; 3) establishing a closed
   season and areas closed to fishing to protect spawning fish; 4)
   increased education for fishermen in basic skills, fishing technology,
   and alternative jobs; 5) continued monitoring and research to assess
   trends in the fishery and to develop culture techniques to help restore
   fish populations; and 6) compliance and enforcement mechanisms to make
   the plan effective, including perhaps establishment of property rights
   for particular areas of the lake for specific groups of fishermen and
   more generally an equitable assignment of lake ecosystem uses between
   fishery and non-fishery users. We recommend the plan be implemented in
   an adaptive fashion with provisions for adjusting regulations as
   conditions warrant. If at least some elements of this plan are not
   adopted then the Lake Patzcuaro fishery is likely to collapse.}},

Abstract = {{During 1998 and 1999, Portland Natural Gas Transmission System
   ({''}PNGTS{''}) and Maritimes \& Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C.
   ({''}Maritimes{''}) (collectively the ``Owners{''}) constructed
   approximately 292-miles of 12-, 24-, and 30-inch outside diameter
   pipeline (the Projects) through portions of Massachusetts, New
   Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. Prior to construction, background
   research and field surveys were performed identifying the rare,
   threatened, and endangered ({''}RTE{''}) plant and animal species
   located along the project route. Field surveys identified a total of 25
   different RTE plant species located in 57 discrete populations; no
   animal species were identified. All plant species identified were
   state-designated, and no Federally-designated Threatened or Endangered
   species were identified. Avoidance of RTE plant populations was the
   preferred form of mitigation considered, however avoidance was not
   always feasible. Where avoidance was not possible, alternative
   mitigation measures were developed in conjunction with the appropriate
   regulatory agencies. A key component of the mitigation program involved
   removal and temporary nursery storage of rare plants during
   construction, and subsequent replanting in their approximate original
   locations following the completion of construction. Other mitigation
   measures included topsoil segregation/replacement and use of timber mats
   to cover and protect the populations from heavy equipment traffic. Post
   construction monitoring after the first growing season revealed that all
   but one of the rare plant populations is viable and vigorous following
   the first growing season. Based on initial results, we conclude that the
   techniques implemented were successful. Proper transplanting during the
   appropriate season, special care and over-winter handling by a qualified
   nursery, and replanting in suitable habitat and during the appropriate
   time window, are critical factors in determining program success. Such
   techniques may be applicable to other pipeline projects.}},

Abstract = {{Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnership (Alliance) has constructed
   approximately 2330 km of natural gas pipeline from northeast British
   Columbia, through Alberta to the Saskatchewan-North Dakota border.
   Vegetation assessment is a requirement of National Energy Board
   regulated pipeline projects. Rare plant surveys and vegetation community
   typing through nine distinct ecological regions were undertaken in the
   summers of 1996 through 1999, along the mainline and laterals in
   segments of native vegetation. Forty-seven species of rare plants, as
   well as a number of significant plant communities, were identified along
   the Alliance right-of-way. Mitigation to avoid or minimize impacts was
   developed for each rare plant site or significant community identified.
   Mitigation measures implemented during construction included re-routing
   or realigning the pipeline within the right-of-way, narrowing down the
   right-of-way, transplanting of individual plants, and seed collection
   for re-establishment after construction. Rare plant survey work is
   normally required for National Energy Board regulated pipeline projects
   that traverse native vegetation. Information regarding the effectiveness
   of the mitigation implemented for conservation of rare plants and
   sensitive plant communities would be of benefit for the planning of
   future projects. As part of Alliance's post-construction reclamation
   monitoring program, an assessment will be conducted to document the
   survival of rare plant populations disturbed during construction.
   Vegetation survey methodology, impact mitigation planning, and a
   preliminary assessment of the successes and difficulties of the
   mitigative measures implemented are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Significant loss of rare plants and their habitats have occurred on the

   such as easements and preserves have been somewhat successful in
   preserving biodiversity but have neglected the role that highway
   rights-of-way could serve as restoration areas for rare plants and their
   ecosystems. We propagated a number of rare plant species, many only
   still surviving on powerline rights-of-way, and reintroduced them in
   appropriate habitat on mitigation projects and cloverleafs along
   Virginia Department of Transportation highway rights-of-way. Key
   elements of our program include: utilization of indigenous plant stocks
   from the local area, registry of reintroductions with state authorities,
   management of sites through mechanical or chemical means, and monitoring
   of the population biology of introduced plants. Highway rights-of-way
   represent a potentially underutilized area for rare plant conservation
   and could augment species preservation and recovery efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The suitability of low technology large woody debris (LWD) structures
   for fish habitat augmentation in streams crossed by transmission
   corridors was investigated at five stream sites (eight structures in
   total) in the Greater Vancouver Area, British Columbia (BC). The
   structure types included lateral logjams (n = 2), a log bank cover, a
   simulated root-wad, tree top revetments (n = 2), and an upstream and
   downstream facing log deflector. Year 2 biological assessments were
   conducted in the early and late summer of 2000. The Year 2 early summer
   catch results were significantly lower than Year 1 results but this was
   likely caused by high discharge conditions and poor sampling conditions.
   The Year 2 late summer catch results, however, are more comparable and
   showed an overall increase in relative fish abundance for the habitat
   units in which LWD structures were placed. Fish were found associated
   with six out of seven structures in the late summer sampling. One
   structure (lateral logjam) failed completely during winter floods and
   was not investigated further in Year 2. Year 2 physical assessments of
   the remaining structures found that most remained in good condition but
   two showed signs of deterioration and one suffered a failed anchor.
   Additional monitoring of structures in Year 3 will provide better
   evaluations of each structures overall success.}},

Abstract = {{We review the interactions between moose Alces alces) and native tree
   species in Fennoscandia. The Fennoscandian boreal forests have been
   intensively managed for wood production over decades. Moose population
   density is also relatively high in these northern forests. Forest
   management affects habitat characteristics and food resources from
   regeneration to final harvest, with the most significant effects
   occurring early in the stand development. The plant-animal interactions
   found in such a situation may be different from what has been observed
   in natural boreal forests with low densities of moose (e.g. in North
   America). The strong focus on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in forest
   regeneration in conjunction with a homogenisation of the landscape
   structure by clear-cutting has favoured moose. Forest development is
   controlled by man from regeneration to final harvest, and in relation to
   human-induced disturbances the disturbance by moose is relatively small,
   but occurs on different spatial levels. At the landscape level, the most
   prominent effects of moose seem to be suppression and/or redistribution
   of preferred browse species. At the forest stand level moose primarily
   induce spatial heterogeneity by browsing patchily and exploiting
   existing gaps. At the tree level, moose damage trees and lower timber
   quality, but also create substrate types (e.g. dead and dying wood)
   valuable for many organisms. Co-management of moose and forest requires
   good monitoring programmes for both plants and animals, as well as
   extensive ecological knowledge on the relations between moose and their
   food plants on different spatial levels.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forest ecosystems are adapted to periodic disturbance, but there
   is widespread concern that conventional forest practises degrade plant
   communities. We examined vegetation diversity and composition after
   clearcut logging, mechanical and chemical site preparation in eight 5-
   to 12-yr old studies located in southern boreal forests of British
   Columbia and Quebec, Canada to find useful indicators for monitoring
   ecosystem integrity and to provide recommendations for the development
   and testing of new silvicultural approaches. Community-wide and
   species-specific responses were measured across gradients of disturbance
   severity and the results were explained in terms of the intermediate
   disturbance hypothesis and a simple regeneration model based on plant
   life history strategies. Species richness was 30 to 35\% higher 5 to 8
   years after clearcut logging than in old forest. Total and vascular
   species diversity generally peaked on moderately severe site treatments,
   while non-vascular diversity declined with increasing disturbance
   severity. On more-or-less mesic sites, there was little evidence of
   diversity loss within the range of conventional silvicultural
   disturbances; however, there were important changes in plant community
   composition. Removing soil organic layers caused a shift from residual
   and resprouting understory species to ruderal species regenerating from
   seeds and spores. Severe treatments dramatically increased non-native
   species invasion. Two important challenges for the proposed natural
   dynamics-based silviculture will be 1) to find ways of maintaining
   populations of sensitive non-vascular species and forest
   mycoheterotrophs, and 2) to create regeneration niches for
   disturbance-dependent indigenous plants without accelerating non-native
   species invasion.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of urban population in Finland has resulted in increased
   fragmentation of urban forests and consequently increased recreational
   pressure on these forests. The effects of fragmentation and trampling on
   the ground and field layer vegetation were studied in mesic Myrtillus
   type Norway spruce-dominated urban forest stands of varying size in the
   greater Helsinki area. The number of residents living in the vicinity of
   the forest stands was an important factor affecting the understorey
   vegetation in urban forests. The cover of understorey vegetation in
   urban forests was remarkably lower than in rural areas, especially the
   ground layer cover, e.g. cover of Pleurozium schreberi, was
   significantly lower in urban forests than in the reference areas. Thus,
   the ground layer proved to be most susceptible to trampling. In the
   field layer, the cover of dwarf shrubs, especially of Vaccinium
   myrtillus, was lower in deteriorated than in undeteriorated urban forest
   stands.}},

Abstract = {{This research was developed in June and July 1998 in Montes Claros,
   State of Minas Gerais, Brazil in ten blocks of a 72 months old
   Eucalyptus urophylla plantation with 365.4 hectares. All ant nests of
   the leaf cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
   were identified, mapped and their areas measured considering the largest
   length and width of each ant nest besides their distance to the nearest
   border of each block of Eucalyptus. After this a fog equipment was used
   to find the number of entrances per ant nest. All ant nests of this leaf
   cutting ant were distributed in classes according to their location from
   the border of each block of Eucalyptus. A total of 222 ant nests of A.
   sexdens rubropilosa was found with the largest percentage of them, total
   area of ant nests and number of ant nest entrances in the classes from 0
   to 10 meters with respectively, 29.3\%; 22.7\% and 10.3\% for each of
   these parameters. If a total of 20\%; 40\%; 60\%; 80\% and 100\% of
   nests of this leaf cutting ant is controlled in the area of Eucalyptus
   the total area controlled would be 64.0; 113.7; 179.7; 240.3 and 319.1
   hectares, respectively, out of 365,4 hectares. The knowledge of the
   spatial distribution of ant nests of A. sexdens rubropilosa in
   plantations of Eucalyptus could allow control of this pest in strips
   inside borders of Eucalyptus blocks and thus reduce labor costs and the
   amount of insecticides in the environment.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Data presented herein indicate that subterranean termite infestations
   can be eliminated by applying non-repellent liquid termiticides solely
   around the exterior perimeter of buildings. Foraging activity was
   extensively monitored on the interior and exterior of 12 structures
   heavily infested with the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes
   flavipes (Kollar). Monitoring methods before and after an exterior-only
   application of either Termidor(R) (fipronil) or Premise(R)
   (imidacloprid) were similar to those used to assess the effects of baits
   on termite populations. Substantial, and often rapid reductions in
   termite foraging activity were observed, particularly with Termidor. Of
   the eight structures treated with Termidor, 40 of 43 infested monitoring
   stations within 0.3 to 4.0 in of the exterior treated trench were
   inactive within three months. Dead and decaying termites were found in
   several monitored locations, further suggesting that effects extend
   inward and well beyond the exterior site of application. Termite
   activity within monitoring stations was less affected by exterior
   Premise applications, although visible activity involving structural
   components eventually ceased. Potential implications and benefits of
   exterior-targeted liquid applications relative to the future of termite
   control are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Coptotermes travians (Haviland) is one of the most important
   subterranean termite pest species attacking urban buildings and
   structures in Malaysia. Two colonies of C. travians infesting
   residential premises (Colony A \& B), and another one in a natural
   habitat (Colony C) were characterized. Foraging territories ranged
   between 125 - 384 m(2), with maximum foraging distances of 17 - 32 m per
   colony. At pre-baiting, mean wood consumption were recorded at 526.4 g
   month(-1), 478.2 g month(-1) and 643.7 g month(-1) for colony A, B and
   C, respectively. Colony sizes for the three colonies were estimated
   using a triple mark-recapture method. Colony size ranged between 3.2 x
   10(5) to 1.3 x 10(6) workers. Baiting against colony A and B was done
   using both in-ground and above-ground hexaflumuron baits, while only
   in-ground baiting was executed against colony C. The baits caused a
   substantial reduction in wood consumption rate in independent monitoring
   stations within 34 - 44 days post-baiting. At this stage, more soldiers
   were observed with a small number of workers. No termite activity was
   visible in the independent monitoring stations, as well as the bait
   stations at 49, 55 and 62 days post-baiting for colony C, A and B,
   respectively. Some challenges of baiting subterranean termites in
   Malaysia are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Non-target invertebrate taxa were collected from underground termite

   absence of termites (wooded areas, homes <10-yr. old, and homes >30-yr.
   old). For validative purposes, one additional site with an active
   termite population was evaluated. Each habitat had unique conditions
   that apparently supported the existence of different invertebrate taxa.
   Ants and earthworms were the only non-target taxa not observed in the
   same stations With termites. Of these two taxa, we conclude the ants are
   the most important with respect to inter-specific antagonism. Ants were
   most highly associated with termite monitoring stations that were (1)
   placed in wooded habitats and (2) remained unchecked for long periods of
   time. As a result, we recommend several measures for consideration by
   pest management professionals to improve the efficacy of termite baiting

Abstract = {{In this paper the results are presented of the dynamics monitored in a
   founder population of a Mediterranean orchid species, Orchis simia LAMK.
   outside its present distribution area, viz. in the southern part of The
   Netherlands. The fate of individual plants has been censured yearly from
   1972 to 2001. Application of this method revealed in an earlier stage of
   this study, that: (i) the species is autogamous, (ii) the minimum
   duration of the underground protocorm stage is at least three years and,
   (iii) the juvenile life phase lasts at least another 3 years. Over the
   30 year observation period four distinct stages are recognized: (i) an
   initial stage (1972-1975), during which only one flowering plant
   ({''}founder plant{''}) was present, (ii) a period of expansion
   (1976-1983) during which the number of plants increased to 60, (iii) a
   period of decline in the number of plants (1984-1995) and, (iv) a rather
   stable stage (1996-2001), characterized by a rather small number of
   individuals. The population decline was likely caused by external
   conditions, e.g. consecutive long-lasting winters and unfavourable
   vegetation development at the site. Throughout the whole period
   temporary absence of plants above ground ({''}dormancy{''}) was
   observed, but the number was variable from year to year. The age of
   individuals was high in the fourth stage, viz. in 1998 on average 15
   years. Since many plants present in stage iv are sexually reproductive,
   mortality rates indicate that plants are long-lived. Yearly mowing and
   removal of vegetation increases the probability that pollinators will
   have access to the inflorescences, an important factor in population
   fitness. Setting aside of the site as a protected Nature Reserve, and as
   a consequence, the introduction of an appropriate management during a
   long time, might preserve this frontier population in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Six hundred Orchis ustulata L. plants have been monitored in Estonia
   since 1993. The plants are distributed in two late-flowering and three
   early-flowering populations. Late-flowering plants are in the subspecies
   aestivalis and early-flowering plants are in the subspecies ustulata.
   Dormancy was common in all populations and over 70\% of the plants that
   survived for longer than 1-2 years did not appear aboveground in one or
   more seasons of their lifetime. In the late-flowering populations the
   proportion of dormant plants was higher and the proportion of vegetative
   plants lower than in the early-flowering populations. All possible
   transitions between dormant, generative and vegetative stages were
   expressed in all populations. This study demonstrates that O. ustulata
   is a short-lived species.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering intensity and vegetative reproduction of a terrestrial orchid
   Cypripedium calceolus L. in six populations was monitored in different
   parts of Estonia for 8-20 years. The clonal structure of the populations
   was identified for the monitoring purposes. We analysed the temporal
   auto-correlation structure of the flowering intensity and ramet number
   per clone in order to study whether there are significant changes
   between years or whether the investments by the orchids tend to be
   similar between years. Most of the populations showed an increasing
   trend in size and flowering. Autocorrelation analysis of the detrended
   data suggests that there is a two-year period in flowering intensity
   within clones. We also measured pair-wise flowering synchrony to test
   whether the fluctuations in the flowering occur in steps within
   populations, that is, whether the changes in the flowering intensity
   occur simultaneously and in the same direction. Synchrony between the
   clones can be observed in some populations but simultaneous fluctuations
   are not equally common in all populations. We discuss the evolutionary
   and ecological reasons and consequences of the flowering periodicity.}},

Abstract = {{Seemingly high variability in orchid populations is often due to a
   phenomenon called ``dormancy{''}, in which no photosynthetic material
   sprouts in a year. Dormancy can cause underestimation of survival
   through its superficial resemblance to mortality. A probabilistic
   demographic model, such as that used in mark-recapture studies, may be
   best able to estimate survival in the face of this confounding life
   history phenomenon. We tested the effects of dormancy on estimation of
   survival using data on 263 small yellow lady's slippers, Cypripedium
   calceolus var. parviflorum (SALISB.) FFRNALD, in Lake Co., Illinois,
   USA, monitored from 1994 to 2000. Resighting histories were created of
   two-, three-, four-, five-, six-, and seven-year lengths starting from
   1994, to test the effects of inclusion of extra years of data on
   survival estimation. Conventional demographic estimation approaches,
   involving correcting for dormancy where it must exist but not where it
   might, were then compared to the results of mark-recapture analyses
   conducted on the same datasets. The results suggest that conventional
   approaches underestimate survival, at times greatly. Conventional
   approaches yielded highly variable estimates for the same years in all
   dataset lengths, ranging from 0.383 to 0.882 for 1994, while
   mark-recapture methods yielded consistent estimates for all dataset
   lengths, ranging from 0.796 to 0.844 in 1994. Mean survival was
   consistently lower for conventional than for mark-recapture methods
   (0.765 vs. 0.845 in the seven-year dataset). Mark-recapture methods were
   also consistent in estimation of dormancy, with a low estimate of 0.370
   for the three-year dataset and a high estimate of 0.402 for the
   seven-year dataset. The mark-recapture approach appears preferable to
   conventional demographic estimation approaches, as it yields consistent,
   relatively unbiased estimates of survival. This may increase accuracy in
   population viability studies, which may suggest higher extinction
   likelihoods with more variable data.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of terrestrial orchids in Europe have been adapted to
   secondary forest-free area, meadows and pastures created by humans.
   Therefore, appropriate vegetation management of the site is essential
   for the orchid populations to persist. Orchis morio L. represents a
   formerly abundant vernal species. Its sites have been rapidly
   disappearing in the last four decades due to loss of habitats caused
   either by agricultural improvement of old hay meadows, or their
   abandonment. During the recent seven years we monitored 44 sites in
   South Bohemia (Central Europe), where O. morio populations still survive
   and established a field experiment, testing effects of different types
   of management on orchid population dynamics. We found that: (i)
   Irregular mowing strongly weakens and destabilises O. morio,
   populations. (ii) Absence of mowing has a serious negative effect on the
   number of flowering plants and leads to changes in species composition
   in the vegetation. (iii) Mowing once or twice a year improves flowering
   performance of orchid populations. (iv) Removal of litter seems to be
   indifferent to O. morio abundance. (v) Mowing once in two years is
   inappropriate for maintenance of this orchid species. (vi) O. morio
   reacts very quickly in a negative way to lack of mowing and very slowly
   in a positive way to management restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced light availability as a consequence of changed management is
   considered to be the main cause of the rapid decline of Ophrys
   insectifera L. in The Netherlands. Cessation of coppicing of woodlands
   and increased growth of shade-tolerant understorey species have
   decreased light conditions in the habitat of this endangered species. To
   restore suitable light conditions, coppicing was reintroduced in the
   woodland uphill of chalk grassland in The Netherlands in 1996. Coppicing
   increased light availability for individuals of O. insectifera on the
   upper part of the grassland. Flowering was significantly positively
   correlated with increased light availability. Individuals in plots with
   the highest light intensity had a higher percentage of flowering plants
   and were able to flower for more consecutive years, compared to plants
   receiving less light. However, only very small positive correlations
   between increased light availability and inflorescence production or
   plant size were found. Percentage of pollinated flowers showed a
   negative correlation with increased light conditions, maybe because of
   changed wind conditions as a result of the coppiced woodland uphill the
   grassland. The importance of short-term experiments on an individual
   plant basis is stressed by the outcome of this study, since flowering
   frequency can only be measured by monitoring individual year-to-year
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging by rice-field rats (Rattus argentiventer) can significantly
   reduce rice harvest. Rat populations are, cyclic responding to season
   and crop maturity. Rat location also reflects the crop cycle. A study
   conducted near Sukamandi, Indonesia described rice-field rat burrow
   systems and patterns of use, and assessed demographics of rice-field
   rats found in burrows adjacent to rice fields. Burrows ranged from
   simple short tunnels to complex systems. Most simple systems consisted
   of a straight tunnel approximately 75 cm long. Mean tunnel length of
   more complex systems was approximately 300 cm, but a few contained
   tunnels up to 700 cm. Burrow systems had between 1 and 5 entrances, with
   0 to 8 choice-points within the system. A choice-point was defined as
   any place within the system where the animal could choose a different
   path (e.g., Y in the tunnel, nest). Number of chambers within systems
   also varied, ranging from none to six. There was no correlation between
   rat activity within a system, measured by the closed-hole method, and
   complexity of the system. Long-term monitoring suggested both male and
   female rats occupied burrow systems along rice banks, except relatively
   short periods during spring (March, April) and early fall (September)
   when burrows were used almost exclusively by females. These periods
   appear to correlate when high numbers of female rats are gestating and
   lactating.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Nevada Division of
   Wildlife (NDOW) have both observed an increase in the population of
   common ravens (Corvus corax) throughout Nevada. This increase is
   suspected to be the result of, at least in part, supplemental feeding
   sources (landfills, road kills, feedlots, etc.). The increase is of
   concern to wildlife managers because ravens are known nest predators,
   and in excessive numbers they could adversely affect a wide variety of
   game birds, including the sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus).
   During the spring in both 2000 and 2001, Wildlife Services (WS) was
   contracted to manage raven numbers in a critical sage grouse nesting
   area in northern Washoe County. The primary management tool used by WS
   was the registered avicide DRC-1339, because it can be selectively used
   on birds that feed on eggs. A prepared DRC-1339 solution was injected
   into hard-boiled chicken eggs and placed in artificial nest sites
   located throughout the project sites. Ravens foraging in the nesting
   area for sage grouse eggs found and consumed the treated eggs and died,
   thus selectively removing the nest-raiding birds from the immediate area
   of the grouse nesting sites. No long-term effect is anticipated on the
   raven population, because treated eggs were placed out only in the
   immediate area of the nesting grouse and only during the brief nesting
   period. The possibility of secondary poisoning resulting from DRC-1339
   use is considered unlikely because the active ingredient,
   3-chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride, is broken down into a non-toxic
   substance and expelled prior to the bird expiring. Consumption of
   DRC-1339 results in death due to renal failure in avian species. Ravens
   found after treatment were monitored for the presence of West Nile virus
   titers.}},

Abstract = {{Canada geese have become established and are now numerous enough in many
   urban and suburban areas that conflicts with humans have become
   frequent. Although potential threats to human health are often cited as
   a justification to manage goose populations, currently available science
   suggests that this is not a serious issue. This leaves the primary
   concern as one of aesthetics-people do not like having to deal with what
   can sometimes be copious amounts of goose droppings. Animal welfare
   interests have questioned the humaneness of different roundup and
   killing programs, and advocated non-lethal approaches and egg addling.
   Both approaches currently are being practiced in a number of different
   communities without, unfortunately, much being done to systematically
   monitor or evaluate them. This paper addresses some of the more
   controversial issues surrounding resident Canada goose management from
   an animal welfare perspective and touches on some of the different
   management approaches currently being practiced as examples of the need
   for better overall coordination and comparison of management approaches.}},

Abstract = {{American blackbears (Ursus americanus) are common predators of ungulates
   in interior Alaska, yet little research has described bear demographics.
   This studyexamines movement, denning, and reproductive characteristics
   of a black bear population in the Yukon Flats in eastern interior
   Alaska. To our knowledge, this location at 66-N latitude is the
   northernmost study of black bears. A totalof 29 ind ividual black bears
   were captured 53 times between 1995 and 1997. Capture rates were high
   with a mean annual rate of 2.3 black bears/10 trap days. A total of 900
   telemetry locations was obtained from 23 radiocollared black bears. Mean
   annual home ranges for adult female and male black bears were 15.5and
   182.5 km(2), respectively. The mean date of den entry was 26 September
   (range: 19 Sep-8 Oct, n = 42) and the mean date of den emergence was 2
   May (range: 26 Apr-6 May, n = 3 1). Mean length of denning exceeded all
   previous reports at 220 days (range: 213-229 days, SD = 4, n = 3 1).
   Females excavated all dens in well drained terrain in forested areas.
   Mean litter size for 7 adult females was 2.1 (n = 10). The recruitment
   and reproductive intervals were 2.0 years (n = 2) and 1.6 years (n = 5),
   respectively. The survival rate forcubs weaned to I year was low (0.45).
   The mean annual survival rate for adultmales was 0.86. We report 2
   likely instances where, during spring, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos)
   preyed on adult female black bears with young.}},

Title = {{Bear reintroductions: Lessons and challenges}},
Journal = {{URSUS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{335-345}},
Abstract = {{Reintroduction is defined as an attempt to establish a species in an
   area thatwas once part of its historical range, but from which it has
   been extirpated or become extinct. Historically, one of the most
   successful programs was the reintroduction of 254 American black bears
   (Ursus americanus) from Minnesota tothe Interior Highlands of Arkansas
   in the 1960s; that population has grown to>2,500 today. More recent
   efforts have involved fewer but better monitored animals and have
   sometimes employed techniques to improve site fidelity and survival. In
   Pennsylvania, for example, pregnant female American black bears were
   successfully translocated from winter dens, the premise being that the
   adult females would be less likely to return because of the presence of
   young cubs. That winter-release technique was compared to summer
   trapping and release in Tennessee; winter releases resulted in greater
   survival and reduced post-releasemovements. Homing has not been a
   problem for small numbers of brown bears (Ursus arctos) reintroduced to
   the Cabinet-Yaak ecosystem in Montana and Idaho and to the mountains of
   Austria and France. Reintroduction success appears to becorrelated with
   translocation distance and is greater for subadults and females. As with
   any small population, reintroduced bear populations are susceptible to
   environmental variation and stochastic demographic and genetic
   processes.Although managers have focused on these biological barriers,
   sociopolitical impediments to bear reintroduction are more difficult to
   overcome. Poor public acceptance and understanding of beats are the main
   reasons some reintroductionprograms have been derailed. Consequently,
   the public should be involved in the reintroduction process from the
   outset; overcoming negative public perceptions about bear reintroduction
   will be our greatest challenge.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to achieve a better understanding of the
   behavior of fecal coliform populations on the vegetation and in the soil
   after slurry spreading in environmental conditions, typical of
   vegetative growth period in mountain hay meadows. Changes in fecal
   coliform populations on the vegetation and in the soil were monitored in
   situ for 3 months after slurry spreading on 9 plots. The variations
   found in populations are related to the agricultural, soil. and climatic
   characteristics of plots and to the moisture regime of soils. These
   observations are compared with laboratory experiments on undisturbed
   soil microcosms. In absence of water flux, survival durations recorded
   in the laboratory and in the field are of the same order of magnitude.
   The data enable us to pinpoint the influence of various factors
   affecting the decline and transfer of fecal bacteria in the plant-soil
   system and consequently to discuss the risk management of water

Abstract = {{A sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) with well established enhanced
   biological phosphate removal (EBPR) was subjected to higher ammonium
   concentrations to stimulate and eventually implement simultaneous
   nitrification. Changes of activity and populations were investigated by
   a combination of online monitoring, microsensor measurements and
   fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) of biofilm sections.
   Nitrification and nitrifying bacteria were always restricted to the
   periodically oxic biofilm surface. Both, activity and population size
   increased significantly with higher ammonium concentrations.
   Nitrification always showed a delay after the onset of aeration, most
   likely due to competition for oxygen by coexisting P accumulating and
   other heterotrophic bacteria during the initial aeration phase. This
   view is also supported by comparing oxygen penetration and oxygen uptake
   rates under low and high ammonium conditions. Therefore, simultaneous
   nitrification and phosphorus removal in a P removing SBBR appears to be
   only possible with a sufficiently long oxic period to ensure oxygen
   availability for nitrifiers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Identifying the relationships between various bacterial populations and
   the substrates they consume is central to the understanding of
   population dynamics and to the development of process control in
   activated sludge. However, linking a heterotrophic population to its
   activity in situ is difficult because ribosomal RNA (rRNA) techniques,
   while allowing the rapid identification of populations, provide little
   information about their heterotrophic activity. Activated sludge models
   describe biodegradation kinetics by classifying substrates into two
   types: readily and slowly degradable substrates. Assuming that bacterial
   populations specialize in degrading one type of substrate, their growth
   rate should be affected differently if the COD loading rate varies
   diurnally as for a municipal activated sludge system. Modeling results
   suggested that the growth rates of populations consuming readily
   degradable substrates vary according to variations in COD loading rate.
   On the other hand, the growth rates of populations consuming slowly
   degradable substrates do not change despite the variation in COD loading
   rate. Since the cellular rRNA level is positively correlated with the
   growth rate, we hypothesized that the rRNA levels of some populations in
   municipal activated sludge should increase throughout the day, while
   they should stay constant for other populations. This hypothesis was
   verified by monitoring the rRNA level of Acinetobacter (a model
   population consuming readily degradable substrates) and Gordonia (a
   model population consuming slowly degradable substrates) in the mixed
   liquor of a full-scale municipal activated sludge reactor for three
   weeks.}},

   when serial stresses were used, substitutions in dominant filamentous

Abstract = {{The population dynamics of activated sludge in a pilot plant with two
   activated sludge systems, both designed for enhanced biological
   phosphorus removal (EBPR), but one of them with (BNP) and the other
   without (BP) nitrogen removal, was monitored during a period of 2.5
   years. The influent water to the pilot plant was periodically
   manipulated by external addition of phosphorus (P), acetate and glucose,
   respectively. The population dynamics and the in situ physiology were
   monitored by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and
   microautoradiography. Significant P removal was observed in both systems
   throughout the whole period, with significant increases of the P removal
   when substrates were dosed. The activated sludge in both systems
   contained large amounts of dense clusters of gram-negative,
   methylene-blue staining coccoid rods during the whole period. A large
   part of the clusters belonged to the beta Proteobacteria, whereas the
   rest of the clusters belonged either to the Actinobacteria or to the a
   Proteobacteria. The relative abundance of Rhodocyclus-related bacteria
   in the activated sludge varied significantly in both systems during the
   whole period (from 6 to 18\% in BNP, and from 4 to 28\% in BP). However,
   no statistically significant correlation of the Rhodocyclus-related nor
   any of the other investigated bacterial groups to the P content of the
   activated sludge (correlation for all groups investigated was always
   <0.5) was observed. A significant P-33(i) uptake was observed by the
   \&beta; Proteobacteria (part of them Rhodocyclus-related, the identity
   of the rest unknown) and the Actinobacteria. However, not all of the
   Rhodocyclus-related bacteria showed P-33(i) uptake. The P removal in the
   investigated plants is thus believed to be mediated by a mixed
   population consisting of a part of the Rhodocyclus-related bacteria, the
   Actinobacteria and other, yet unidentified bacteria.}},

   within Australia has demonstrated that a group of bacteria known as the
   ``G{''} bacteria are able to proliferate under a broad range of plant
   configurations. The diverse designs and operational parameters of these
   plants did not permit definitive determination of the factor(s)
   contributing to the proliferation of G bacteria. Two plants were
   monitored over time to assess the G bacteria and phosphorus accumulating
   organisms (PAO) populations in relation to key operational parameters.
   The mixed liquor biomass and operational parameters were compared to
   other plants successfully and unsuccessfully reducing phosphorus from
   the wastewater. Two critical factors recognised in this study were the
   dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic zone and the type and
   amount of carbon source in the anaerobic zone.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical analytical data has long been used to monitor the performance
   of activated sludge plants even though the process relies on the
   performance of microorganisms. It is now evident that a rapid and
   reliable quantitative method is required, to be able to monitor the
   organisms responsible for nutrient transformation and their activities,
   allowing avenues for more efficient nutrient removal. The development of
   real-time or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) also known as
   TaqMan(R) or 5'-nuclease assay has allowed the rapid, quantitative
   analysis of DNA templates, eliminating some of the variability
   traditionally associated with other quantitative techniques. In this
   study analysis of Nitrospira spp., one of the key organisms in nitrite
   oxidation in wastewater treatment, was used to validate real-time PCR
   for the their quantification in activated sludge. A probe and primer
   set, targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Nitrospira spp. was designed
   according to the constraints of the TaqMan(R) specifications. Samples
   used to evaluate the method included DNA from the sludge from full-scale
   wastewater treatment plants and laboratory scale systems. The
   reproducibility, quantitative efficiency and specificity were assessed
   in the evaluation. It was concluded that the method is sensitive and
   reproducible but has some constraints on the quantitative efficiency. A
   survey of full-scale systems for Nitrospira spp. was carried out and the
   results are presented here.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study, we showed that there was a significant increase in
   mycolata numbers associated with foaming events at a wastewater
   treatment site possessing three activated sludge plants. In this paper,
   we demonstrate that branched filamentous mycolata were a minor
   proportion of the mycolata morphotypes present in those activated sludge
   plants, accounting for less than 21\% of the mycolata population in the
   mixed liquor and foam samples examined. In most samples examined, the
   number of filamentous mycolata was negligible compared to the number of
   other mycolata morphotypes present. Furthermore, filamentous mycolata
   did not contribute to any of the significant differences in mycolata
   concentration observed between foaming and non-foaming situations
   (P<0.01). These findings suggest that conventional microscopic
   examination for monitoring mycolata populations in foaming plants may be
   misleading and should be used with caution.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the EU-sponsored MACOBS (Monitoring and Control of Bulking
   Sludge through Molecular Probe Assays) project, the size and the
   composition of the filamentous population in 73 industrial activated
   sludge plants, were investigated. The inventory included plants in
   Denmark, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands. Large filamentous
   populations were present in about 60\% of the plants, which means that
   bulking of activated sludge, which is no longer a serious problem in
   modern domestic nutrient removal plants, still occurs frequently in
   industrial treatment plants. The filamentous micro-organisms present
   were identified/described by ``traditional{''} methods, based on their
   morphological features and several staining techniques, and by the
   application of molecular probes (FISH: Fluorescent In Situ
   Hybridisation). Nine species specific probes were available when the
   project started, nine new probes have been developed during the project.
   Fifty nine different filamentous species were observed in the samples,
   including ca. 40 species that have not been described so far. The
   unknown species are denoted as Type Ind-1, 2, 3, etc. Probes are now
   available for the identification of about 17 species. Further research
   aimed at developing additional probes will be necessary in order to
   establish which species distinguished provisionally are identical, viz.
   morphotypes of the same filamentous organism.}},

   WWTP from textile industry showed growth and decline of one of these
   organisms when operational conditions in the plant were varied. The
   present paper demonstrates that bulking sludge in industrial wastewater
   treatment plants can effectively be monitored using a combination of
   standard chemical analyses and the FISH technique.}},

Abstract = {{A batch scale experiment was conducted to determine the effect of pH on
   enterococci die-off. A continuous flow system was also established to
   determine the environmental conditions and their effects on enterococci
   removal. The batch experiment was conducted for pHs: 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11
   under light and dark conditions. Enterococci and DO were measured every
   day and every other day respectively for nine days. Pathogen removal
   rates at pH 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11 in the light/dark were (expressed as
   d(-1)) -2.1/-2.1, -2.1/-1.5,-2.1/-1.5,-2.1/-1.4 and -1.1/-1.0,
   respectively. DO levels were low, between 0.17 mg/L at pH 4 (light) to
   0.56 mg/L at pH 7 (light). The continuous flow system consisted of
   Pistia (water lettuce), duckweed and algal treatments in series of four
   ponds with a total retention period of 28 days after two days of
   anaerobic pre-treatment. After two months of operation, temperature, pH,
   DO, TDS, and enterococci populations were monitored. A low pH of 4.4 was
   obtained in the Pistia ponds. Neutral conditions were observed in the
   duckweed system, while pH values >9 were observed in the algal system.
   Enterococci decreased from 7.8x10(6) to <500/100 ml in all treatment
   systems after 28 days of treatment with no significant differences

Abstract = {{A newly developed biosensor for nitrite having a 90\% response time of
   about 1 min was used to monitor nitrite concentration in activated
   sludge exposed to oxic/anoxic cycles. The NO2- biosensor contains
   bacteria that reduce NO2-, but not NO3-, to N2O that is subsequently
   monitored by a built-in electrochemical sensor. Nitrite plus nitrate
   (NOx-) was simultaneously monitored by a NOx- biosensor. The maximum
   operational lifetime of the NO2- biosensor was 6 weeks, but much longer
   lifetimes can be expected as malfunctioning by the 3 sensors used for
   longer periods was due to either mechanical damage or ineffective
   internal sterilization during the construction. Insufficiently
   sterilized sensors became sensitive also to NO3-after some time due to
   development of NO3--reducing bacterial populations within the sensor.
   The fraction of NO2- as compared to NO3- in the activated sludge was
   very dependent on prehistory, actual loading, and aeration. During
   balanced operation with NH4+ being exhausted during the later parts of
   the aerobic cycle, NO2- increased in concentration up to about 50 muM
   during the early part of the aeration cycle until NH4+ became limiting.
   At that time the NO2- concentration decreased to low levels. Under some
   operating conditions a peak of NO2- also appeared in the beginning of
   the anoxic period. NO2- and NO3- were depleted simultaneously during the
   anoxic period.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses based on ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-targeted hybridization performed
   in our laboratory identified two types of bacterial populations: a
   population with a high RNA level per biomass and a population with a low
   level of RNA per biomass. To extend these descriptions, the diurnal
   dynamics of the RNA pool were monitored by rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide
   probe membrane hybridization. Under the typical diurnal variation in COD
   loading rate experienced by municipal wastewater treatment plants, the
   RNA level of the bacterial population with a high level of RNA per
   biomass varied with changes in the COD loading rate. Under the same
   conditions, the RNA level of the population with low RNA level per
   biomass remained constant. A structured biomass model was developed to
   describe these data. Substrate COD was divided into a readily
   biodegradable and a slowly biodegradable COD fraction. It was assumed
   that two specialized populations coexist in municipal activated sludge
   treatment systems. One population consumes readily degradable COD and
   the other consumes slowly degradable COD. According to model
   simulations, the population consuming readily degradable COD has a high
   level of RNA per biomass under variable substrate concentrations.
   Comparatively, the population consuming slowly degradable COD has a low
   level of RNA level per biomass. Furthermore, model simulations
   reproduced the two diurnal RNA profiles observed in a full-scale
   municipal activated sludge system. Therefore, we suggest that two
   populations can be distinguished in municipal activated sludge systems:
   a population consuming readily degradable substrate and a population
   consuming slowly degradable substrate.}},

   the Lippeverband, which has been created since 1985. For the near
   future, the integration of the plants of the Emschergenossenschaft
   including storm-water tanks is scheduled. The current connection ratios
   of the WWTPs which are to be monitored vary between 500 and 1,940,000
   Population Equivalents. The data recorded at each plant are transmitted
   to the allocated catchment area centre and then to the district centres.
   The encompassing monitoring centre serves the integrated control of all
   plants. The comprehensive remote control is managed through the
   presentation of relevant plant-type-specific system parameters. The
   investment costs of approximatelyt 33,000 Euro/plant and annual costs of
   9,400 Euro/plant stand against a considerable increase of the operation

   significantly at an annual rate of 4.8\% based on June counts of adults,
   and at 2.9\% based on August counts of adults. Individuals in pairs
   composed 81\% and 72\% of adults in June and August, respectively. Young
   swans composed 25\% of all swans recorded in August. Numbers of nests
   varied substantially among years ((x) over bar = 79, range = 44-116),
   and did not increase significantly over the study period. The density of
   nests was low ((x) over bar = 0.04 nests km(-2)), but except for higher
   densities on deltas, was comparable to other sections of the Arctic
   Coastal Plain. Mean annual nesting success (i.e., total broods per total
   nests) was 83\% (range 64\%-100\%) and mean brood size was 2.5 young per
   brood. The number of nests was positively correlated with cumulative
   thaw degree-days (cumulative number of degrees per day above freezing)

Abstract = {{Mute Swans (Cygnus olor) and Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) in Sweden
   have been monitored as part of the International Waterbird Census (IWC)
   since 1967. For the Whooper Swan, midwinter indices show fluctuations
   around a slowly increasing trend. Country-wide surveys in 1971-72,
   1988-89, 1995 and 2000, however found a more substantial increase in
   numbers, with national totals estimated at 2,000, 4,000, 8,000 and 8,000
   individuals, respectively. The difference between the trends indices and
   the results of the country-wide surveys is attributable to the birds
   using more terrestrial habitats since the early 1980s, which are less
   well covered by the IWC. In 1995, 33\% of the swans were found on land,
   compared to 43\% in January 2000. For the Mute Swan, the midwinter
   indices showed a significantly increasing trend from 1970 to 2000,
   whereas autumn indices from September counts fluctuated around a more or
   less stable level, but with a decrease in the last few years.
   Country-wide midwinter counts recorded about 8,000 Mute Swans in 1973,
   13,000 in 1988-89 and over 15,000 in january 1993.}},

Abstract = {{During 1990-1996, Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) were translocated
   from high-risk wintering sites in the Greater Yellowstone Region of
   Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana to potential new wintering areas in Idaho,
   Wyoming, Oregon, and Utah in an attempt to broaden winter distribution
   and reduce the vulnerability of the Western Canada and Greater
   Yellowstone breeding populations, which winter primarily in Greater
   Yellowstone. Survival and movements of 1,127 neck-banded swans
   translocated in 1990-1995 were monitored to determine their use of new
   wintering areas in years after translocation. Survival estimates were
   hindered by uneven resighting effort and lack of data on neck-band loss,
   however, at least 683 swans, including 71\% of adults and 50\% of
   cygnets, survived at least one year after translocation. Of these 683
   swans, 62\% subsequently wintered away from the monitored Greater
   Yellowstone winter habitats. By 1997, persistent use by >50 wintering
   swans existed at only two of eight release sites. We conclude that
   Trumpeter Swans would establish greater use of new wintering sites if
   winter translocations, primarily of juveniles, were made to sites (1)
   that have adequate ice-free food and low human disturbance, (2) that are
   situated directly south of currently occupied winter habitat, and (3) at
   which obvious mortality factors, such as shooting and power lines, are
   minimized.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-25}},
Abstract = {{The spatial and breeding dynamics of koalas in sub-tropical woodlands at
   Blair Athol in central Queensland were intensively monitored between
   1993 and 1998. Genetic relationships among koalas at this locality were
   studied to determine the breeding dynamics of males, including whether
   `resident' or `transient' males dominate as sires. Males and females
   were radio-collared and tracked periodically throughout each year of the
   study. Genotypes from hypervariable microsatellite loci identified
   uniquely all individuals and were used to analyse parentage as well as
   to determine population genetic parameters when compared with other
   regional localities. Koalas at Blair Athol comprise a population in
   genetic equilibrium. Gene diversity estimates show the population to be
   similar to other populations found in similar habitat in the region, and
   estimates of genetic differentiation among four regional populations
   showed that gene flow conforms to a model of isolation by distance.
   Analysis of parentage found that both resident and transient males sired
   about equal numbers of offspring. Familial DNA analysis revealed
   multiple paternities of successive young in this population. The
   conclusion from this study is that `resident' status among males does
   not confer any advantage for parentage.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc phosphide was tested on populations of house mice in cereal stubble
   and pasture paddocks in the Central Mallee region of Victoria, in Autumn
   1997. There were three replicates of two application methods: aerial and
   ground (perimeter) baiting. The response of mouse populations to baiting
   was monitored by live-trapping; estimates of population size and
   survivorship were compared between baited and unbaited sites (n = 3)
   taking prebaiting population sizes into account. Zinc phosphide was
   effective in decreasing the abundance (adjusted trap success) of mice on
   aerially baited sites (by 51\%), but the reduction observed on
   ground-baited sites (24\%) was not significant. There was no change in
   abundance on the untreated sites. There was a significant reduction in
   the survivorship of mice on both aerially and ground-baited sites
   compared with unbaited sites. Non-target species were monitored before
   and after baiting. Only four bird deaths were recorded as a result of
   the baiting program. Given that birds are highly mobile, with deaths
   possible many kilometres from the bait sitesit was difficult to fully
   assess the impact of poisoning on bird species in the area without more
   rigorous searching of vegetated areas further from baited paddocks.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated a passive tracking index (PTI) when plots were placed on
   lightly used dirt roads versus placement on naturally occurring bare
   ground in natural habitat. PTIs were calculated before and after removal
   of coyotes and some non-target species during another study that
   evaluated capture devices. Six mammals were simultaneously monitored
   with the PTI: coyotes, raccoons, white-tailed deer, feral swine,
   javelina, and rabbits. PTIs from road plots were significantly higher
   than from off-road plots, except for deer and javelina, for which no
   differences were detected. After removal of coyotes, PTIs were
   significantly lower, both from on-and off-road plots. For coyotes and
   raccoons, the decline in index values primarily reflected population
   reductions. For animals hunted for sport (deer, swine, javelina),
   population reductions were minor compared with coyotes, and their
   declines in index values likely reflected conditioned responses to the
   activity and shooting that accompanied evaluations of the capture
   devices. We conclude that the PTI is sensitive to changes in population
   or changes in activity in response to an event for a variety of species,
   and it is most useful when placed on lightly used dirt roads.}},

Title = {{Reproductive demographics among brush-tailed phascogales (Phascogale
   tapoatafa) in south-western Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{247-257}},
Abstract = {{Reproduction and population demographics were examined among wild
   brush-tailed phascogales in southern Western Australia. Data were
   gathered in a single region during 1992-97 from 387 individuals, 139 of
   whom were monitored by radio-telemetry. In contrast to Victorian
   phascogales, which all have eight teats, the Western Australian
   population contained females with six (30\%), seven (21\%), and eight
   (49\%) teats (n=72). Teat numbers varied between mothers and
   daughters/sisters, which appears unprecedented among dasyurids. The data
   strongly suggest that females try to raise as many young as they have
   teats. Population changes are as described for Victorian phascogales:
   complete male die-off occurs in July; some females survive to breed in a
   second year; and there is long-distance male dispersal and high
   philopatry by female offspring. Births occur from July to September,
   somewhat later and also less synchronised than among Victoria
   phascogales. Late breeding by females in one year suggests that sperm
   storage may be extensive in this species. Strong associations between
   the physical condition of females and rainfall suggest that these may
   influence between-year variation in birth times and sex-ratio bias in
   litters. Similarly, poor physical condition of young during drought may
   have underpinned atypical dispersal behaviour in males. Decreased teat
   numbers and smaller litter sizes indicate that phascogales from
   south-western Western Australia are reproductively adapted to relatively
   low food availability. However, this species experiences difficulty
   successfully breeding and rearing young under drought conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In most areas of Australia, mammals constitute the staple diets of cats,
   foxes and dingoes. In central Australia the abundance of mammals is
   often too low to meet the dietary requirements of these carnivores and
   yet populations of cats, foxes and dingoes persist. To investigate
   alternative feeding strategies of cats, foxes and dingoes in arid
   environments, their diets were monitored in relation to prey
   availability in two areas of the Tanami Desert where rabbits do not
   occur. Dietary information was obtained by analysing predator scats
   collected between 1995 and 1997. Prey availability was monitored by
   track counts, pitfall trapping, Elliott trapping, and bird counts along
   walked transects. In contrast to dietary studies elsewhere in Australia,
   it was found that reptiles were an important component of the diets of
   predators in the Tanami Desert, and should be classified as seasonal
   staples. Birds increased in importance in the diets of cats and foxes
   during the winter, when reptiles were less active. There was
   considerable overlap between the diets of all three predators, although
   dingoes ate more large prey items (e. g. macropods) than the other two
   predators. Results highlight the opportunistic feeding habits of cats,
   foxes and dingoes and show that, although mammalian prey are less
   important in central Australia than has been found elsewhere, species
   that are vulnerable to extinction, such as the bilby (Macrotis lagotis),
   mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda) and marsupial mole (Notoryctes
   typhlops), are also consumed by these predators.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods commonly used to monitor population sizes of the wild
   European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are spotlight transect counts
   and active burrow-entrance counts. The accuracy and precision of these
   techniques were assessed by comparing monitoring data with population
   estimates derived from intensive observation of a tagged rabbit
   population near Melbourne, Australia. Both monitoring methods proved
   capable of yielding population indices linearly related to population
   density and robust to seasonal changes in population dynamics. The
   influence of environmental and temporal variables on rabbit emergence,
   and hence on spotlight transect data, was also investigated. By using
   data collected over a wide range of weather conditions, 55\% of the
   variation in evening emergence behaviour of rabbits could be predicted
   by environmental and temporal factors, with solar time, precipitation,
   air temperature and wind speed accounting for most of this. However, the
   precision of spotlight transect count data, which are routinely
   collected at a fixed time of night under mild weather conditions, was
   not improved by attempting to correct for the effects of weather and
   time on emergence; continuing to conduct counts under such conditions
   was supported as a reliable practice.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{489-502}},
Abstract = {{The acceptability of three types of non-toxic predator baits to a
   variety of indigenous non-target species was determined in the
   laboratory. The bait-types tested were: Dried Meat Bait (DMB), Probait
   and two sizes of FoxOff(TM) baits (30 g and 60 g). The potential
   poisoning risk, if the baits had been toxic, was calculated for each
   species from their consumption of non-toxic bait and their sensitivity
   to 1080. Three species consistently sampled baits; Dasyurus geoffroii,
   Trichosurus vulpecula and Rattus fuscipes. Where species have had
   exposure to fluoroacetate-bearing vegetation, their consumption of bait
   and their level of tolerance to 1080 was such that only 2 of 15, 4 of
   15, and 3 of 6 species were considered to be potentially at some risk
   from toxic DMBs, Probait, and FoxOff(TM) baits, respectively. In
   contrast, and mainly because of their lower tolerance to 1080, the
   theoretical risk for those species without evolutionary exposure to
   fluoroacetate-bearing vegetation was such that 6 of 12, 8 of 12, and 8
   of 9 species theoretically face a high or moderate risk from 3-mg DMBs,
   Probait, and FoxOff(TM) baits, respectively. We emphasise, however, that
   theoretical risk does not necessarily equate to a practical risk, and
   these results are best used to determine which non-target species should
   be monitored at the population level during predator-control operations.
   Factors affecting the potential risk to non-target indigenous animals,
   and some cautions when extrapolating data from laboratory-based studies
   to the field situation, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Before the establishment of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in central
   Australia in May 1996, a program was instituted to monitor its impacts
   at six localities broadly distributed across the region. At these sites,
   population trends in rabbits and other wildlife were studied over a
   2.5-year period. Rabbit populations declined by approximately 85\%
   following establishment of RHD at the sites, and had not recovered 22
   months later. More varanid lizards were detected on our survey plots
   12-22 months after RHD than during the preceding period. Although
   numbers of dingoes and wedge-tailed eagles varied during the study,
   significant population reductions were not detected in either species in
   the wake of RHD. Significant population changes were not detected in red
   foxes, feral cats, red kangaroos, small mammals, or other raptor
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) may be the most important rabbit
   control agent to be made available to graziers in Australia since the
   advent of myxomatosis. Documenting the benefits of RHD to agricultural
   production values is an important process in determining best-practice
   strategies for the use of the disease in controlling rabbit populations.
   In this paper we review previous studies on the impact of rabbits and
   present recent Australian case studies that tracked the effects of RHD
   on agricultural production as the disease first spread across the
   continent. Indirect consequences of RHD, such as changes in costs of
   rabbit control as monitored through the use of 1080 (sodium
   monofluoroacetate), are reported. Potential negative impacts such as
   adverse effects on the wild rabbit fur and meat trade and in the spread
   of woody weeds are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of predation and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) on
   population dynamics of rabbits, and the survival of juvenile rabbits,
   was investigated between July 1999 and March 2000 in North Canterbury,
   New Zealand. Rabbit abundance and pre- and post-emergent rabbit
   mortality were monitored on four sites, two of which were subject to
   predator control. RHD spread naturally through all sites from late
   November to early December. Rabbit densities declined on all sites, but
   after the RHD epidemic, declines were significantly greater where
   populations of predators had not been controlled. Survival of rabbit
   nestlings was lower where predators were not controlled. All
   post-emergent radio-collared rabbits died at sites where predators were
   not controlled, whereas 18\% of those collared at sites where predators
   were controlled survived to maturity. In contrast to the results from
   previous studies, rabbits born at the start of the breeding season had
   very high rates of post-emergent mortality, as they appeared to be
   susceptible to the RHD virus later in the breeding season. The age at
   which juvenile rabbits become susceptible to RHD, the timing of RHD
   epidemics, and the abundance of predators are likely to be important in
   determining survival of juvenile rabbits. This study demonstrates that
   predation can reduce rabbit populations to low levels, but only in
   combination with other factors, in this case RHD.}},

Abstract = {{In pursuit of development, the Lagos megalopolitan environment has been
   pressurized and strained beyond endurance, thus causing disasters. The
   indiscriminate utilization of houses at the cost of rebuilding and
   renewing capacities has become perilous to her existence and survival.
   It is therefore necessary to preserve and conserve housing processes in
   megacities so as to prevent disasters.
   This paper examines the problems, effects, preventive measures and
   sustainable solutions to housing disasters in megacities. Lagos has been
   chosen as case study. In Lagos manmade disasters frequently occur and
   they are avoidable. The hazards and damage to lives and properties
   caused by them can be minimized by improved methods of assessment,
   planning and management, as well as reassessment and exchange of ideas,
   programmes and policies related to disaster prevention and preparation
   of framework of action plan at different level. These must be integrated
   and coordinated.
   This paper shows the impact of housing disaster on society as a direct
   consequence of increasing population density and urban growth and partly
   as an indirect environmental consequence of this trend. The paper
   further espouses and advocates for adequate monitoring for early
   warnings and surveying, adequate guide for physical planning,
   appropriate action for reducing disaster susceptibility and
   vulnerability. Finally, the paper suggests certain sustainable
   strategies such as awareness creation and political will development at
   preventing housing disasters.}},

Title = {{Noninvasive assessment of adrenal activity associated with husbandry and
   behavioral factors in the North American clouded leopard population}},
Journal = {{ZOO BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-98}},
Abstract = {{The North American clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) population is far
   from self-sustaining. Breeding success is poor and behavioral problems
   (i.e., fur-plucking. tail-chewing, excessive hiding or pacing, and
   intersexual aggression that results in mate killing) are common. This
   study was undertaken to investigate whether some of these problems may
   be indicators of chronic stress (as reflected by persistently elevated
   glucocorticoid levels) and whether they are associated with specific
   management factors. A fecal corticoid metabolite assay was validated to
   monitor adrenal activity in clouded leopards. Adrenocorticotropic
   hormone (ACTH) challenges conducted in four clouded leopards established
   the biological relevance of the assay system. Fecal corticoid
   concentrations increased 14-fold above baseline within 24 hours after
   ACTH administration. Adrenal activity then was monitored in 72 (36 males
   36 females) clouded leopards (65\% of the North American Species
   Survival Plan population) during a 6-week period and compared to
   husbandry and behavior data. There was a significant (P < 0.01) gender
   difference in fecal corticoid concentrations, with females producing
   higher concentrations than males, Multiple regression analyses revealed
   negative associations (P < 0.01) between enclosure height, number of
   hours keepers spent with each animal per week, and corticoid
   concentrations. A positive correlation (P < 0.001) was found between the
   number of keepers caring for an individual and corticoid concentrations.
   Higher fecal corticoid concentrations (P <= 0.05) were measured in
   clouded leopards kept on public display or near potential predators
   compared to individuals maintained off exhibit or in the absence of
   predators. Individuals that performed self-injuring behaviors also had
   elevated fecal corticoids (P < 0.01). Spearman-rank, correlation
   analysis of keeper ratings and hormone data revealed positive
   associations (P less than or equal to 0.05) between some behaviors
   (pace, sleep. hide, and fearful/tense) and fecal corticoid
   concentrations. Overall these results indicate that noninvasive fecal
   corticoid monitoring has enormous potential for investigating how
   management and behavioral problems are related to animal well-being. If
   conducted under carefully controlled experimental paradigms, this
   technique could allow researchers and managers to identify problem areas
   of captive management for clouded leopards (e.g., enclosure height,
   keeper time) and evaluate the efficacy of strategies designed to promote
   animal welfare and increased reproductive success. Zoo Biol 21:77-98,

Abstract = {{Reproductive steroid profiles in female (n = 13) and male (n = 5) red
   wolves (Canis rufus) were characterized in fecal samples collected
   during the breeding season (December-May) and over a 1 year period,
   respectively. Blood samples from females (n = 12) also were collected
   during the periovulatory period for luteinizing hormone (LH) and steroid
   analysis. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of fecal
   extracts determined that estradiol and estrone constituted the major and
   minor forms, respectively, of fecal estrogen metabolites. Although
   native progesterone was present, pregnane metabolites predominated as
   the major forms of fecal progestins. HPLC analysis of fecal extracts
   from males revealed no native testosterone, but rather the predominance
   of more polar androgen metabolites. Based on hormone profiles and/or pup
   production, females were classified as pregnant (n = 3),
   ovulatory-nonpregnant (n = 9), or acyciic (n = 3). Longitudinal
   monitoring of females indicated no pregnancy-specific differences in
   concentrations of either fecal progestagen or estrogen metabolites
   compared to ovulatory-nonpregnant individuals; however, baseline
   progestagen concentrations were consistently elevated in acyclic
   females. There was good correspondence between serum and fecal steroid
   concentration during the periovulatory period. A rise in serum estrogens
   preceded the ovulatory LH surge which was then followed by a significant
   progesterone rise during the luteal phase. In males, changes in fecal
   androgen metabolite concentrations coincided with photoperiod
   fluctuations, increasing in late autumn and reaching peak concentrations
   during mid- to late winter just before the start of the breeding season.
   Collectively, these results serve as a database of ovarian and
   testicular endocrine events in this species, which can be utilized in
   population management and application of assisted reproductive
   technologies. (C) 2002 Wiley Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of contemporary land-cover change require an integrated approach
   because changes in cover and environmental conditions are primarily
   caused by land uses, which, in turn are governed by human driving forces
   in a specific socioeconomic and cultural context, Therefore, a research
   perspective which bridges the gap between the more specialized
   approaches of natural and social sciences is required. The present
   study, investigates cultural landscape transformation in the high
   mountain oases of Chitral, lying in the eastern Hindukush. Comparisons
   of historical photographs and replicates serve to demonstrate change and
   persistence of cultural landscape structures. The focus is on the
   irrigated fields of individual villages and shortened in time scale to
   the last 30 years. Due to the general population growth, the development
   of the cultural landscape is characterized by recent village
   enlargements and corresponding extensions of cultivated areas while the
   individual field sizes decrease. Intensified irrigation of the
   cultivated terraces has led to a significant increase in hygrophilous
   trees and thickets along the water channels. The regional center of
   Chitral Town is characterized by a higher building density and expansion
   of urban structures. The results show that repeat photography can serve
   as a basis for monitoring contemporary landscape transformation. (C)

Abstract = {{Little is known about to what extent the sensitivity of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may be state dependent and
   vary in the same species between environments. Here we tested whether
   the faecal corticosteroid concentrations of matrilineal adult female
   spotted hyenas are influenced by social and reproductive status in
   adjacent ecosystems and whether they vary between periods with and
   without social stress. Females in the Serengeti National Park frequently
   become socially subordinate intruders in other hyena territories by
   undertaking long-distance foraging trips to migratory herds, whereas in
   the Ngorongoro Crater they usually forage inside their own small
   territories on resident prey: The faecal corticosteroid concentrations
   in Serengeti females were significantly higher than in Ngorongoro
   females. Energy expenditure by lactation is exceptionally high in
   spotted hyenas and this may be reflected in their corticosteroid levels.
   The faecal corticosteroid levels in both populations were higher in
   lactating than in non-lactating females. During periods of social
   stability, faecal corticosteroid concentrations increased in
   non-lactating females but not in lactating females as social status
   declined. Lactating Serengeti females had significantly higher faecal
   corticosteroid concentrations during periods with acute severe social
   stress than during periods without, indicating that the HPA axis is
   sensitive to social stimuli even in lactating females. So far few
   studies have used non-invasive monitoring methods for assessing social
   stress in free-ranging animals. This study demonstrates for the first
   time, to the authors' knowledge, that corticosteroid concentrations may
   differ between periods with and without social stress for a free-ranging
   female mammal and that the modulating effect of social status may depend
   on reproductive status.}},

Abstract = {{A recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used
   to assess exposure of Florida wild green turtles Chelonia mydas to LETV,
   the herpesvirus associated with lung-eye-trachea disease (LETD), Plasma
   samples from 329 wild juvenile green turtles netted in the Indian River
   lagoon, along the Sebastian reef, or in the Trident basin (Indian River
   and Brevard Counties, Florida) were tested by ELISA for the presence of
   antibodies to LETV. Plasma samples from 180 wild juvenile green turtles
   were tested from these study sites to compare the prevalence of
   anti-LETV antibodies, While some plasma samples from each site contained
   anti-LETV antibodies (confirmed by Western blot analysis), plasma
   samples collected from the Indian River lagoon had statistically higher
   optical density values measured in the ELISA, No statistical differences
   were observed when these same plasma samples were analyzed for changes
   in the level of anti-LETV antibodies over 3 years (1997, 1998, and
   1999). To explore the relationship between anti-LETV antibodies and
   fibropapillomatosis (FP), plasma from 133 green turtles scored for
   fibropapilloma tumor severity were tested by ELISA. There was no
   correlation between tumor severity and the presence of antibodies
   against LETV, Additional plasma samples collected from 16 tagged green
   turtles captured and sampled more than once (recaptures) were also
   tested to monitor antibody levels to LETV relative to the FP status of
   individual turtles over time. Again there was no clear relationship
   between FP tumor status and the presence of antibodies to LETV, Finally,
   ELISA tests on plasma from 13 nesting female turtles (9 green and 4
   loggerhead) revealed high levels of anti-LETV antibodies in 11
   individuals, including 2 loggerhead turtles, These results provide
   strong evidence that wild Florida green turtle populations at these 3
   study sites are exposed to LETV or a closely related virus and that
   loggerhead turtles may be exposed as well, Based on a cutoff optical
   density value of 0.310, 71 out of the 329 wild Florida green turtles
   tested were seropositive for LETV antibodies (seroprevalence = 21.6\%.).
   In addition, no relationship between FP tumor severity or Status and the
   presence of anti-LETV antibodies was found, further supporting the
   hypothesis that LETV and the FP-associated herpesvirus (FPHV) are
   separate infections of marine turtles.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence is accumulating indicating the importance of antioxidant enzyme
   activity measurements in eco-toxicological studies, as they may
   constitute markers for exposure to a large variety of pollutants.
   Variation of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
   glutathione S-transferases (GST) and the effect of heavy metals and
   selenium exposure on these enzymes were investigated in the livers of
   Iberian endemic minnows (Leuciscus alburnoides complex) captured in a
   copper (Cu) mining area. Higher hepatic levels of copper and selenium
   were always observed in fish captured at the polluted site relative to
   the reference area population, reflecting the environmental monitoring
   results. A seasonal fluctuation in zinc and selenium levels for both
   populations was also observed which could be related to gonad
   maturation. The activity of SOD did not show significant regional
   alterations, but a seasonal variation occurred presumably associated
   with the Leuciscus life cycle. The GST activity was higher in the fish
   population from the polluted area (except in spring) and GST variability
   was associated with selenium and copper levels when both regions were
   compared. The increased GST activity was probably a metabolic adaptation
   to the continuous exposure to higher levels of those elements. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A 21-month individual identification project on the Samburu and Buffalo
   Springs National Reserves' elephant population was conducted between
   November 1997 and July 1999. The free ranging population, of at least
   767 elephants, which relied heavily on areas outside the reserves, was
   individually identified. The numbers of elephants observed per day
   fluctuated but were greater during dry periods then wet. However, the
   sizes of aggregations were greater during wet periods. Preliminary
   investigation suggested that the population could be divided into two
   groups, which were designated resident and non-resident family units.
   The groups comprised approximately equal numbers of cows and calves, but
   temporally had different reserve use patterns and calving peaks. The
   daily numbers of males and musth males were correlated with numbers of
   females. The reserves appeared to be a focal area for calving,
   indicating that the study area was of reproductive importance to the
   population. Demographic data indicated a female biased population sex
   ratio, with over twice the number of mature females to males. The
   observed sex skew was greatest for older age classes, and the density of
   musth bulls in the study area was low. The population was affected by
   poaching. Continued monitoring will assist conservation efforts by
   alerting authorities of major demographic or range use changes.}},

Abstract = {{White-faced sakis (Pithecia pithecia) are among the least studied
   neotropical primates. The combination of shy and quiet behavior, their
   ability to move silently, and the extreme difficulty of capturing them
   may explain why very few field studies have been undertaken in
   undisturbed habitats. During the course of a wildlife rescue in French
   Guiana, six individuals were captured and translocated to a safe area of
   primary rainforest. In this area, based on the observation of 35 groups,
   the average group size was 2.3 animals (SD = 1.2) and a density of 0.28
   group/km(2) (0.64 individuals/km(2)) was estimated from transect
   censuses. Our study focused successively on three radio-collared animals
   (two males and one female) over a 287-day period, starting from release
   to the loss of the animal. From the study start, the triangulation
   method was used prior to habitutation to human presence, followed
   thereafter by 1,327 hr of visual monitoring. The translocated animals
   settled down, and two of them had a stable and compact home range. Two
   of them merged in association with members of the resident population. A
   resident group had a much larger home range than previously reported:
   148 and 287 ha, using grid cells and 100\% minimum convex polygon
   techniques, respectively. A group composed of two translocated
   individuals (one male and one female) had a home range of 68 and 135 ha
   using the same techniques. Additionally, two solitary animals used 152
   and 162 1-ha quadrats. We observed animals (translocated and residents)
   moving quickly in one direction up to 11.5 kin. The mean daily path
   length of resident animals was 1,880 m. Sakis used the lower strata of
   the forest more when in group, and the intermediate strata more when
   solitary. Allogrooming is fairly common in social groups. On average,
   the activity period ranged from 7:17 to 15:59 hr. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The climatic and sea ice conditions of the Southern Ocean are highly
   variable within and between years, and a better understanding of the
   influence of climatic conditions on the various parts of the marine food
   chain is needed. This paper summarizes data on breeding success of a
   krill-dependent predator, the Wilson's storm petrel Oceanites oceanicus,
   in a colony on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica,
   over four breeding seasons from 1995/1996 to 1999/2000. The seasons
   differed greatly in environmental conditions and in the resulting food
   availability which was reflected in inter- and intra-annual variations
   in feeding frequency. The breeding success was consequently variable.
   Starvation, the main cause of chick mortality in three out of four
   breeding seasons was associated with reduced sea ice cover in winter,
   which is known to depress food availability in the following breeding
   season. Food delivery rates also depended on the prevailing winds, which
   drive the transport of zooplankton-rich water masses. Snowstorms caused
   additional chick mortality in two out of four seasons when nest burrows
   became blocked. Implications for the use of Wilson's storm petrels for
   monitoring of krill are considered.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent study, EPA found a significant relationship between PM2.5
   mass measurements at a community site and personal exposure samples in a
   Towson, MD retirement facility. This manuscript builds upon the mass
   concentration results by evaluating the exposure relationships with the
   elemental composition of the PM2.5 mass. Daily community, outdoor, and
   indoor PM2.5 were measured with a URG Versatile Air Pollutant Sampler
   (VAPS). Daily personal and apartment PM2.5 samples were collected with a
   Marple Personal Exposure Monitor (PEM). Only subjects with the most
   complete data records (n = 10) were used in this analysis. Significant
   differences were found between the VAPS and PEM samplers for PM2.5
   elemental composition, so all subsequent analyses were conducted
   independently for each of the data sets. Both the VAPS and PEM samples
   were analyzed with energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF). In
   addition, the VAPS samples were analyzed for pH, major ions, and
   elemental/organic carbon. The spatial correlation coefficients between
   the community and outdoor monitor, and the indoor infiltration rates
   were calculated for several PM2.5 constituents calculated from the VAPS
   samples including sulfate, nitrate, trace element oxides, soil, and
   NaCl. The spatial correlations for most PM2.5 constituents were good
   (e.g. sulfate (r(2) = 0.99)), with the exception of soil (r(2) = 0.40).
   Infiltration rates of the PM2.5 constituents were determined by linear
   regression analysis and varied according to particle size. Infiltration
   rates ranged from 0.41 (r(2) = 0.98) for sulfate to 0.09 (r(2) = 0.83)
   for nitrate. Outdoor, central indoor, apartment, and personal exposures
   PEM samples were also evaluated using a linear mixed effects model and
   median Pearson correlation coefficients. The modeling results indicate
   that personal exposures to PM2.5 and sulfate were strongly associated
   with outdoor concentrations. Conversely, personal exposures to soil and
   trace element oxides were not significantly correlated to outdoor
   concentrations. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The age-specific density of the red-lipped stromb Strombus luhuanus
   (Mollusca: Gastropoda) was monitored over 13 years (1981-1993) at four
   locations on the intertidal reef flat at Heron Island, Great Barrier
   Reef. Densities were highly variable, but there were persistent,
   location-specific differences in population density, age structure and
   adult body size, the latter indicating that the populations were not
   extensively linked by adult movement. There was relatively high
   recruitment at most locations in 1984, 1989 and 1993, each occurring
   approximately 2 years after El Nino/Southern Oscillation events,
   although recruit density during these years varied in both space and
   time. The studied strombs experienced three disturbance events: (i)
   experimental harvesting at two locations (1984-1985); (ii) siltation
   from a harbour dredging operation (1987-1988); and (iii) a severe
   cyclone (1992). Resilience to harvesting at a local scale (0.5-2 ha) was
   high: density had recovered within a year, due to immigration of adults
   and older juveniles. Strombus luhuanus responded much more strongly to
   broad-scale changes to its environment than to localized harvesting.
   After dredging, there was a progressive density decline coupled with low
   recruitment at two locations, and a later decline at a third location,
   followed by a recruitment-driven rebound after the cyclone. Generalized
   environmental effects of siltation and the cyclone were also reflected
   in substantial changes in algal cover. Long-term variations in
   environmental conditions probably cause high temporal variation over
   large spatial scales through effects on the survival of larvae or
   recruits. Localized short-term field monitoring of such species would
   give a misleading picture of key factors affecting population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{For species that form multi-generational and territorial family groups,
   resource-rich areas are predicted to support family dynasties in which
   one genetic lineage continuously occupies an area and may even expand to
   occupy surrounding areas. Data from a long-term study of Tasmanian
   native hens (Gallinula mortierii) support this prediction. The
   reproductive success and dispersal patterns of 18 hen lineages were
   monitored for seven breeding seasons and over several generations. The
   founder group with the highest average territory quality produced the
   highest total number of fledged young and the highest number of fledged
   linear descendants, accounting for 24\% of the combined reproductive
   output of these 18 lineages. In the space of 6 years, this single
   genetic lineage expanded from one territory to occupy 12 of the 47
   territories present in the population. This rate of expansion was over
   four times the population average for the same period. A multivariate
   analysis revealed that the success of a genetic lineage depended only on
   the number of high-quality territories surrounding the founder group.
   These results further demonstrate the resource-dependent nature of
   reproductive success in this species, and also highlight the potential
   importance of family dynasties in other cooperative species with complex
   social dynamics and dispersal patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies dealing with individual pattern in acoustic signals are
   based on recordings made within a few hours or a few days, However, in
   long-lived animals, individual signatures are likely to be involved in
   social contact and pairing over several years. Variability of calls and
   more particularly of individual specific pattern over years has been
   poorly investigated. This study examines calls produced by a nocturnal
   long-lived raptor, eagle owls (Bubo bubo) in order (1) to determine
   which call structures are individually specific and (2) to examine
   variability of these individual structures over 2 years. A computerised
   sound analysis and subsequent data were submitted to univariate and
   multivariate statistics to determine individual specific cues of the
   call. A first analysis conducted on 116 calls emitted by 9 wild males
   recorded on a short time period enables to identify each emitter without
   any mistake. Analysis conducted on 70 calls emitted by 5 captive birds
   recorded during two different years emphasised a weak variation of all
   call parameters. Discriminant analysis correctly classified 100\% of the
   individual eagle owls and thus, it is possible to reliably assign a call
   to the individual caller based on the acoustic properties of the
   vocalisation. We therefore conclude that territorial calls emitted by
   eagle owls may constitute an individual pattern over several years. The
   possible biological role of individual signatures and their use for
   monitoring population purpose are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite numerous, generally unsuccessful attempts to reintroduce
   threatened Australian mammals, the factors leading to their failure have
   not been fully clarified, although predator control would appear to be
   of paramount importance. An experimental approach was taken in
   attempting to establish a population of bridled nailtail wallabies ih an
   area of apparently suitable habitat and low fox density, but on the edge
   of the species' former range. The 133 wallabies released since late 1996
   comprised four groups captive-bred animals, wild caught from the single
   remaining wild population, animals that were captive bred and
   acclimatised at the translocation site in a 10 ha predator-proof
   enclosure, and animals which had been bred in the enclosure. Survival
   was highest in those bred in the enclosure and highly variable among
   captive-bred animals. Survival estimates for wild recruits suggested the
   population would maintain a positive rate of increase under prevailing
   environmental conditions. Spotlighting surveys suggested the population
   had increased to approximately 400 animals by late 1999. Above average
   rainfall during 1996-1999 and no apparent predation suggests caution in
   describing the translocation as a success. Ongoing monitoring is
   critical, because it A uncertain ho v the population will cope with
   drought and inevitable predation events, and whether the population will
   expand and persist outside of limited preferred habitat. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Small, local populations of the endangered Mountain Pygmy-possum
   Burramys parvus occur on the Koskiuszko Plateau, in south-eastern
   Australia, including within ski resort lease areas. Between 1986 and
   1998 four populations, two within and two outside ski areas, were
   studied to assess their dynamics and to determine if ski resort
   management was likely to impact on the conservation of the species. One
   of the resorts, at Mount Blue Cow, was constructed as the study
   commenced. Analysis of the 11-12 year data sets showed strong site
   differences in sex ratios, annual and winter survival rates, site
   persistence, recruitment and spring weights, Regional trends, attributed
   to exogenous climatic factors, were evident but population fluctuations
   were generally uncorrelated and strong site by year interactions
   occurred for most demographic parameters. Despite this, strong density
   dependence on all sites in recruitment and to a lesser extent annual
   survival suggest B. parvus is habitat limited and that social factors
   drive demographics in these populations. There was no evidence that the
   ski resort at Mount Blue Cow had any significant impacts above natural
   yearly variation in demographics in the first I I years of its
   operation. However, the highest quality sites, in terms of population
   size and stability, were those within the two ski resort lease areas.
   Further, the asynchronous population dynamics, a small amount of
   migration between habitat patches, differences in site quality and
   heterogeneity in site structure and aspect, which may contribute to
   population persistence, indicates that a metapopulation approach to
   conservation of B. parvus on the Kosciuszko plateau is warranted. This
   has important implications for long-term conservation of B. parvus in
   the ski resort areas. These sites will require careful monitoring and
   management to ensure the continued viability of the resident and
   surrounding B. parvus populations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{There is uncertainty about the importance of various factors in
   explaining declines of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
   populations in the Snake River basin of Oregon and Idaho. This
   uncertainty has prevented implementation of long-term recovery actions
   for these stocks. We used simulation models and decision analysis to
   evaluate three management actions for seven index stocks of Snake River
   spring and summer chinook salmon: (i) continue current operation of the
   Columbia River hydropower system, (ii) maximize transportation of
   smolts, and (iii) natural river drawdown (breaching) of four Snake River
   dams. Decision analysis provided a useful approach for including
   multiple hypotheses about population responses to environmental and
   anthropogenic factors, systematically assessing the importance of
   alternative hypotheses, and identifying risk-averse recovery strategies
   that meet survival and recovery goals over a wide range of
   uncertainties. We found that the most influential uncertainties were
   related to hypothesized causes of estuary and ocean mortality. Current
   monitoring provides limited information on survival in this life stage;
   carefully designed management experiments are more likely to generate
   useful information. Given that these uncertainties exist, drawdown was
   the most risk-averse action, meeting long-term survival and recovery
   goals over a wider range of assumptions than the other actions.}},

Abstract = {{The Galapagos Islands harbor some of the least impacted marine
   ecosystems in the tropics, but there are indications that local
   artisanal fishing is affecting exploited marine communities. To quantify
   these effects, I sampled communities of fishes and sea urchins at a
   number of heavily fished and lightly fished sites throughout the central
   islands of the archipelago, Sites were selected based on information
   collected as part of a local fisheries monitoring study and standardized
   across a number of abiotic factors. Abundance and biomass of the primary
   target species were significantly lower in the heavily fished sites than
   in the lightly fished sites, Community structure also differed between
   heavily and lightly fished sites. Cluster analyses of the full community
   of fishes and a subset of nontarget fishes revealed that sites within a
   treatment were more similar to one another than sites between
   treatments. Herbivorous fishes tended to be lower in abundance and sea
   urchins tended to be higher in abundance in heavily fished sites, but
   these differences were not significant. My results are encouraging in
   that the direct effects of artisanal fishing are limited to the primary
   target species, which probably results from a high specificity of
   fishing gear. The differences in community structure, however, suggest
   that artisanal fishing also has cascading effects on noncommercial
   species throughout the community An improved understanding of important
   ecological interactions, increased ecological and fishery monitoring,
   and effective precautionary management are needed to ensure that human
   effects in these waters remain minimal.}},

Abstract = {{Symbolic machine learning methods induce explicitly represented symbolic
   models from data. The models can thus be inspected, modified, used and
   verified by human experts and have the potential to become part of the
   knowledge in the respective application domain. Applications of symbolic
   machine learning methods to ecological modelling problems are numerous
   and varied, ranging from modelling algal growth in lagoons and lakes
   (e.g. in the Venice lagoon) to predicting biodegradation rates for
   chemicals. This paper gives an overview of machine learning applications
   to ecological modelling, focussing on applications of symbolic machine
   learning and giving more detailed accounts of several such applications.

Abstract = {{Panicum hemitomon, Spartina patens, and Spartina alterniflora are
   wide-spread dominant grasses of fresh, brackish, and salt marsh plant
   communities, respectively. Our previous research identified significant
   intraspecific variation in salt tolerance and morphology among
   populations within each species. In this study our objectives were to
   determine shorter-term physiological/biochemical responses to salinity
   stress and identify potential indicators of salt tolerance, with the
   ultimate goal of discerning similarities and differences in the
   mechanisms of salinity stress resistance. We subjected a subset of six
   populations within each species, ranging from high to low salt
   tolerance, to sublethal salinity levels (4, 20, and 30 ppt.
   respectively, for species) and monitored physiological and growth
   responses after 1 week (early harvest) and 5 weeks (late harvest). In
   all three species sublethal salinity levels generally resulted in
   significantly reduced net CO2 assimilation, leaf expansion, midday leaf
   xylem pressure, water use efficiency, and live and total biomass; and
   significantly increased leaf Na+/K+ ratio, leaf proline, leaf glycine
   betaine, leaf sucrose, root-to-shoot ratio, and dead:total aboveground
   biomass ratio. All three species displayed significant population
   (intraspecific) variation in net CO2 assimilation, leaf expansion, water
   use efficiency, midday leaf xylem pressure, leaf proline, leaf glycine
   betaine (except Panicum, where it could not be accurately determined),
   leaf Na+/K+ ratio, leaf sucrose, total plant biomass, dead:total
   aboveground biomass ratio, and root-to-shoot ratio. General indicators
   of salt tolerance (regardless of species) included high net CO2
   assimilation rates and water use efficiencies, and low ratios of
   root-to-shoot and dead:total aboveground biomass. Factor analysis and
   a-priori linear contrasts revealed some unique differences between
   species in terms of the relative importance of morphology and physiology
   in explaining intraspecific variation in salt tolerance. Plant
   morphology (size attributes) were strongly associated with salt
   tolerance in P. hemitomon, weakly associated with salt tolerance in S.
   patens, and not associated with salt tolerance in S. alterniflora.
   Highly salt-tolerant populations of Spartina alterniflora displayed the
   greatest ion selectivity (lower leaf Na+/K+ ratios), which was not
   displayed by the other two species. These results suggest that plant
   size attributes can be very important in explaining population
   differences in salt tolerance in glycophytes, but may be independent of
   salt tolerance in halophytes, which have specialized physiological
   (and/or anatomical) adaptations that can confer salinity stress
   resistance through mechanisms such as selective ion exclusion and
   secretion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Probing behavior of Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), Russian wheat aphid,
   and Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), corn leaf aphid, was measured on
   barley lines resistant and susceptible to D. noxia grown under low and
   high soil moisture. R. maidis reproduces similarly on both barley lines.
   Probing behavior was interpreted from waveforms of an alternating
   current electrical penetration graph (AC EPG) system of the Oklahoma
   design during 6-h monitoring periods. Significant effects were observed,
   particularly the aphid species by barley line interaction. Averaging
   across moisture levels, D. noxia took longer to first enter sieve
   element phase when probing D. noxia-resistant `STARS-9301B' (306 +/-
   19.9 min {[}mean +/- SEM]) than when probing susceptible `Morex' (180
   +/- 21.6 min). In contrast, R. maidis relatively quickly entered sieve
   element phase on the two barley lines (average of 132 +/- 13.7 min),
   with no detectable difference between lines. When measuring the total
   duration of sieve element phases, the stylets of D. noxia were in
   contact with phloem sieve elements, of STARS-9301B for a shorter period
   (27 +/- 10 min) than with sieve elements of Morex (111 +/- 21 min). In
   contrast, stylets of R. maidis were in contact with sieve elements of
   the two barley lines for similar time periods (average of 176 +/- 15.8
   min). Any mediating effect of soil moisture was slight, if at all
   measurable, using the AC EPG system, making any interpretation of
   probing behavior relative to previous observations of aphid population
   growth affected by plant water stress untenable. In contrast, monitoring
   probing behavior was beneficial in assessing how plant resistance may
   affect aphid species differently. The differences in probing behaviors
   between the two, aphids fed barley resistant and susceptible to D. noxia
   corresponded well with previous. observations that D. noxia population
   growth was lower on D. noxia-resistant barley than ell susceptible
   barley, while R. maidis population growth was similar on the two barley
   lines.}},

Abstract = {{Forensic analyses of chlorinated hydrocarbon plumes typically entail
   reviews of site records, flow and transport modeling, and analysis of
   indicator compounds to gain insights into the behavior of a contaminant
   plume in the subsurface. Such approaches are directed toward unraveling
   the specific circumstances associated with the disposal history and
   hydrogeology of a site. A complimentary approach is to compare the
   behavior of a particular plume with a population Of Plumes from other
   sites that may be influenced by similar mechanisms (e.g. transformation
   processes such as reductive dehalogenation). In other words, hypotheses
   pertaining to plume behavior can be tested against a knowledge base of
   what is typical behavior and what is not. To address this proposed
   methodology, three example applications of statistical techniques to a
   multi-site data set are presented to provide background for problems
   that may be pertinent to forensic analyses. These examples include
   measuring the frequency of association between selected chlorinated
   hydrocarbon compounds, assessing the effects of transformation processes
   on temporal concentration trends in populations of groundwater
   monitoring wells, and dating plumes, in a relative sense, by
   concentration correlation analyses. In each case, the results of the
   statistical analyses are consistent with expectation, indicating that
   meaningful trends in chlorinated hydrocarbon plume behavior may be
   discerned from a diverse multi-site data set. (C) 2001 AEHS.}},

Abstract = {{There is no existing formal, long-term program for gathering evidence of
   the incidence and severity of the health effects of toxic substances in
   wildlife. However, research-based studies of bald eagles, herring gulls,
   night herons, tree swallows, snapping turtles, mink, and beluga over the
   past 30 years have revealed a broad spectrum of health effects in the
   Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin including thyroid and other endocrine
   disorders, metabolic diseases, altered immune function, reproductive
   impairment, developmental toxicity, genotoxicity, and cancer. These
   effects occurred most often and were most severe in the most
   contaminated sites (Green Bay, Saginaw Bay, Lake Ontario, the St.
   Lawrence estuary, and more recently, Lake Erie), some of which are
   International Joint Commission-designated Areas of Concern (AOCs). In
   all cases, a strong argument can be made for an environmental etiology,
   and in many cases for the involvement of persistent organic pollutants,
   particularly polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For some, the
   association with particular contaminants is consistent with controlled
   studies, and in some, dose-response relationships were documented. The
   biologic significance of these health impairments to the affected
   species is currently unclear, but they resemble those observed with
   increased incidence in human subpopulations in one or more AOCs.
   Formalizing health effects monitoring of sentinel wildlife species by
   the parties to the Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement is
   required, This would facilitate the optimal use of sentinel wildlife
   health data in a larger, epidemiologic weight-of-evidence context upon
   which to base decisions and policies regarding the effects of chemical
   exposures on human populations.}},

Abstract = {{Our knowledge about the distribution of exposures to toxic chemicals in
   various communities is limited. Only about 6\% of approximately 1,400
   toxic chemicals have been identified in surveys. Even for those
   chemicals that are measured, information is often insufficient to
   identify smaller populations at high risk. The question is whether
   information about the distribution of diseases in communities can help
   identify environmental risks, indicate areas of concern, and thus
   substitute exposure information. Thyroid disorders represent a large
   group of diseases that cannot be recorded into registries because of the
   lack of clear caseness; community-based monitoring of subtle health
   effects is needed. Thus, to identify potential health risks in
   communities, epidemiologic studies including effect and human exposure
   monitoring are necessary, However, to overcome the limitation of
   nonsystematic case studies, the development of a network of exposed
   communities concerned about exposures is proposed, A network would
   provide assessments of exposures and health outcomes, with different
   communities mutually serving as exposed and control groups. Such a
   network would foster communication and prevention measures within
   communities often left out of the dissemination of information about
   risks identified in studies conducted with residents of these
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Acid mine drainage from abandoned mines and acid mine pit lakes is an
   important environmental concern and usually contains appreciable
   concentrations of heavy metals. Because sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)
   are involved in the treatment of acid mine drainage, knowledge of acute
   metal toxicity levels for SRB is essential for the proper functioning of
   the treatment system for acid mine drainage. Quantification of heavy
   metal toxicity to mixed cultures of SRB is complicated by the
   confounding effects of metal hydroxide and sulfide precipitation,
   biosorption, and complexation with the constituents of the reaction
   matrix. The objective of this paper was to demonstrate that measurements
   of dissolved metal concentrations could be used to determine the
   toxicity parameters for mixed cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria. The
   effective concentration. 100\% (EC 100), the lowest initial dissolved
   metal concentrations at which no sulfate reduction is observed, and the
   effective concentration, 50\% (EC50), the initial dissolved metal
   concentrations resulting in a 50\% decrease in sulfate reduction, for
   copper and zinc were determined in the present study by means of
   nondestructive, rapid physical and chemical analytical techniques. The
   reaction medium used in the experiments was designed specifically (in
   terms of pH and chemical composition) to provide the nutrients necessary
   for the sulfidogenic activity of the SRB and to preclude chemical
   precipitation of the metals under investigation. The toxicity-mitigating
   effects of biosorption of dissolved metals were also quantified.
   Anaerobic Hungate tubes were set up (at least in triplicate) and
   monitored for sulfate-reduction activity. The onset of SRB activity was
   detected by the blackening of the reaction mixture because of formation
   of insoluble ferrous sulfide. The EC 100 values were found to be 12 mg/L
   for copper and 20 mg/L for zinc. The dissolved metal concentration
   measurements were effective as the indicators of the effect of the heavy
   metals at concentrations below EC100. The 7-d EC50 values obtained from
   the difference between the dissolved metal concentrations for the
   control tubes (tubes not containing copper or zinc) and tubes containing
   metals were found to be 10.5 mg/L for copper and 16.5 mg/L for zinc.
   Measurements of the turbidity and pH, bacterial population estimations
   by means of a most-probable number technique, and metal recovery in the
   sulfide precipitate were found to have only a limited applicability in
   these determinations.}},

Abstract = {{Harmful algal blooms in the Chesapeake Bay and coastal bays of Maryland,
   USA, are not a new phenomenon, but may be increasing in frequency and
   diversity. Outbreaks of Pfiesteria piscicida (Dinophyceae) were observed
   during 1997 in several Chesapeake Bay tributaries, while in 1998,
   Pfiesteria-related events were not found but massive blooms of
   Prorocentrum minimum (Dinophyceae) occurred. In 1999, Aureococcus
   anophagefferens (Pelagophyceae) developed in the coastal bays in early
   summer in sufficient densities to cause a brown tide. In 1997, toxic
   Pfiesteria was responsible for fish kills at relatively low cell
   densities. In 1998 and 1999, the blooms of P. minimum and A.
   anophagefferens were not toxic, but reached sufficiently high densities
   to have ecological consequences. These years differed in the amount and
   timing of rainfall events and resulting nutrient loading from the
   largely agricultural watershed. Nutrient loading to the eastern
   tributaries of Chesapeake Bay has been increasing over the past decade.
   Much of this nutrient delivery is in organic form. The sites of the
   Pfiesteria outbreaks ranked among those with the highest organic loading
   of all sites monitored bay-wide. The availability of dissolved organic
   carbon and phosphorus were also higher at sites experiencing A.
   anophagefferens blooms than at those without blooms. The ability to
   supplement photosynthesis with grazing or organic substrates and to use
   a diversity of organic nutrients may play a role in the development and
   maintenance of these species. For P minimum and A. anophagefferens, urea
   is used preferentially over nitrate. Pfiesteria is a grazer, but also
   has the ability to take up nutrients directly. The timing of nutrient
   delivery may also be of critical importance in determining the success
   of certain species.}},

Abstract = {{Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and
   movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation
   in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed
   population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical
   increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density
   dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to
   offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is
   straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in
   population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general
   concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified
   using some combination of spawner-recruit analysis, long-term field
   monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems
   arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and
   these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty
   associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to
   predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very
   general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific,
   using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner-recruit database
   to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that
   derive from a three-endpoint life-history framework designed for fish.
   We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific
   processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative
   studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that
   illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses
   at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that
   offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are
   discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves
   process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history
   theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based
   modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of
   compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the
   underlying mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In Florida, U.S.A. populations of recreationally and commercially
   important bivalve molluscs are stressed by a variety of factors,
   including habitat degradation, overfishing and development. Bivalves
   such as the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians, and the hard clam,
   Mercenaria spp., are uniquely positioned to benefit from restoration and
   enhancement activities because of the physical setting in which they
   live or because of recent efforts to restore habitat. For bay scallops,
   a major restoration effort has been implemented on the west coast of
   Florida. Adult scallops are collected from the target site and spawned
   in the laboratory. The offspring are cultured in ponds until they reach
   an average shell height of approximately 30 mm and then are planted in
   cages at the target site from which the parents were collected. Parents
   and offspring are genetically monitored, as are new recruits sampled at
   a variety of sites along the coast. The ultimate goal of this
   restoration program is to create concentrated patches of spawners that
   will supply recruits to west Florida seagrass beds. For hard clams,
   three different strategies are being tested to determine the most
   ecologically and economically feasible approach to use to enhance
   harvestable clam populations. Hard clams are occasionally abundant in
   the Indian River lagoon on the east central coast of the state, but
   transportation causeways fragment the lagoon into a series of basins
   that are largely isolated from one another. At any time, only a subset
   of the basins that compose the lagoon may be environmentally suitable
   for supporting the sensitive larval and juvenile stages of hard clams,
   and the members of that subset change constantly as environmental
   conditions change in the lagoon. Transplanting spawner stock, seeding
   juveniles under a variety of protective treatments, and injecting
   fertilized eggs directly into the lagoon are each being tested for their
   effectiveness in exploiting environmentally appropriate conditions and
   producing successful settlement events. Each strategy is being tested
   for its ecological and economic suitability, and the most appropriate
   strategy will be implemented in an effort to maintain clam abundance at
   a level where licensed clammers in the Indian River region can realize a
   minimum income from the fishery, even when naturally recruiting clam
   stocks are depleted.}},

Title = {{Evaluating fluctuating asymmetry in a stream-dwelling insect as an

Abstract = {{1. We examined fluctuating asymmetry (FA) among individuals of the
   stream-dwelling stonefly Nemoura trispinosa (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) to
   determine whether individuals exposed to an increase of 2-3.5 degreesC
   in water temperature would show greater FA than reference (control)
   individuals.
   2. Mature nymphs were collected from two adjacent channels (one
   experimental, one control) in a longitudinally divided stream both
   before and during a 2-year temperature manipulation. No consistent
   differences were found between the experimental and control channels for
   any measure of FA.
   3. Four additional reference sites were studied to estimate `natural'
   variation in FA, and to assess any relationship between FA and
   population genetic structure (e.g. heterozygosity). Variation in FA
   among these sites was greater than that resulting from the manipulation.
   Allozyme analysis indicated low to moderate levels of genetic
   differentiation among sites (Wright's F-ST mean = 0.06, maximum = 0.13)
   and there were negative correlations between FA and heterozygosity
   (H-exp).
   4. We surveyed experimental studies published since 1996 to evaluate the
   generality of our results. Of 44 comparisons examining an association
   between an experimental stress and FA, 19 (43.2\%) failed to detect any
   relationship. This pattern did not depend on the taxonomic group or the
   number or type of traits, although some stressors appeared to be more
   likely to produce an increase in FA than others.
   5. We conclude that FA maybe unreliable for detecting subtle biological
   changes resulting from small temperature shifts, and concur with others
   that the technique should be viewed with extreme caution as a monitoring
   tool.}},

Abstract = {{A test was developed that measures in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence
   variables to assess the apparent sensitivity of freshwater periphytic
   algae to photosystem II inhibitors. Natural periphytic communities from
   rivers were collected on artificial substrata, and the effects of
   short-term exposures to two PSII herbicides (atrazine and isoproturon)
   on the fluorescence parameters were measured with a pulse-amplitude
   modulated fluorometer. The EC50 for each herbicide were calculated from
   fluorescence yield indices, and these results were compared to
   C-14-based primary production measurements on the same communities. The
   fluorescence-based method appears to give very reliable estimations of
   EC50 for each pesticide we tested, ranging from 0.46 to 5.18 muM and
   0.07 to 6.77 muM for atrazine and isoproturon, respectively. This method
   could be used in ecotoxicology monitoring programs, to detect changes in
   natural periphyton populations sensitivity, following photosystem II
   herbicide contamination in rivers or lakes.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of 53 Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Perring populations from
   different agricultural regions in California and Arizona was conducted
   from 1997 to 1999 to establish baseline toxicological responses to
   buprofezin and pyriproxyfen. Although both compounds proved to be highly
   toxic even in minute quantities to specific stages, geographical and
   temporal differences in responses were detected using a leaf spray
   bioassay technique. Monitoring for three years revealed that six to
   seven populations had higher LC(50) values but not greater survival when
   exposed to these two insecticides. A significant difference in relative
   susceptibility to buprofezin was first observed in late season 1997 in
   San Joaquin Valley populations with LC(50)s ranging from 16 to 22 mg
   (AI) / liter(-1) compared with LC(50)s of 1 to 3 mg (AI) / liter(-1) in
   Imperial, Palo Verde Valley and Yuma populations. Whiteflies collected
   in subsequent years from these and other locations showed an increase in
   susceptibility to buprofezin. Regional differences in susceptibilities
   to pyriproxyfen were minimal within the same years. Three years of
   sampling revealed consistently higher LC50s to pyriproxyfen in
   populations from Palo Verde Valley, CA, compared with whiteflies from
   Imperial, San Joaquin Valley or Yuma. As was the case with buprofezin, a
   decline in LC(50)s to pyriproxyfen was observed in whiteflies from all
   locations sampled in 1999. However, no correlation was observed between
   buprofezin and pyriproxyfen toxicity in,my of the strains. The variable
   toxicities observed to both compounds over a period of 3 yr may be due
   principally to inherent differences among geographical populations or
   due to past chemical use which may confer positive or negative
   cross-resistance to buprofezin or pyriproxyfen.}},

Abstract = {{Glass vials coated internally with an insecticide were used as a
   resistance monitoring technique for testing field populations of the
   woolly whitefly, Aleurothrixus floccosus (Maskell), collected from
   citrus. The distribution of resistance to the insecticide butocarboxim
   in citrus orchards from Valencia (Spain) during 1993 and 1994 was
   determined by means of this technique. Adults resting on citrus shoots
   were captured with a portable vacuum cleaner and introduced into the
   vials. The technique provides control mortality of < 25\% when assessed
   7 h -after the insects are captured. In 21 populations tested, LC(50)s
   ranged from 1.8 to 42.3 mg/ml. This represents resistance ratios >
   20-fold among populations. Lower slopes of the concentration-mortality
   line were found in whitefly populations that exhibited a low level of
   the LC50. Resistance was widespread in the Valencia area but spatially
   irregular, with nearby orchards occasionally showing wide differences in
   resistance levels. The levels of resistance to butocarboxim obtained
   with this technique closely matched the field efficacy of the
   insecticide. This residue bioassay provides a convenient and rapid
   method to monitor insecticide resistance in A. floccosus populations.}},

Abstract = {{Traps made by rectangular pieces of 3 mm thick corrugated cardboard of
   four different sizes, 200 by 140 (A), 140 by 100 (B), 100 by 70 (C), and
   200 by 40 mm (D), were evaluated as a sampling device for the chicken
   mite, Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer). Mites were trapped during 2, 4, 6,
   8, and 10 d, respectively, in a poultry house heavily infested with the
   parasite. Significantly greater numbers of mites were collected by trap
   B. Additionally,, significantly more mites were collected during the
   sampling periods 6-10 d than by 2 and 4 d. However,xith regard to trap
   size and sampling period, trap C, used for 2 d, collected significantly
   more mites per day and trap area than any of the other traps. Therefore.
   such a trap was suggested for monitoring population trends of chicken
   mites in poultry houses. The larger traps contained significantly higher
   numbers of mites per trap and may therefore be feasible to use in
   alternative, nonchemical control programs. Optimum sample size. or
   number of traps required to monitor population trends of D. gallinae,
   was also calculated. At a relative variability of 20\%. and at densities
   of 2,000-20,000 mites per trap, approximate to 11-16 of trap B and 11-19
   of trap C would be adequate to monitor mites.}},

Abstract = {{The last decade has witnessed a growing awareness that fishes can not
   only be severely overfished but could also be threatened with extinction
   through over-exploitation. Among commercially important species, those
   particularly at risk are large and slow to mature, iteroparous and may
   have sporadic recruitment. The threat of extirpation or extinction may
   be greater if species are particularly valuable, have a limited
   geographical range, are part of mixed-species fisheries, or are
   distributed solely within areas of intense fishing activity.
   Significantly, there is little empirical or theoretical basis for
   hypothesizing that highly fecund species are any less at risk than those
   of low fecundity as is often assumed. Indeed, the use of fecundity in
   estimating reproductive output in long-lived, highly fecund, pelagic
   egg-producing species may be deeply flawed. A general resistance to
   accepting that fecund marine fishes could become endangered through
   exploitation stems from poor understanding of population dynamics,
   especially in the early post-settlement phase, coupled with assumptions
   of fishers models that ignore critical components of life history
   theory. Moreover, faith in the ability to manage exploited species
   effectively leads to the perception that severe declines are management.
   rather than conservation. issues. The growing list of threatened marine
   species and a realization of the many factors that place them at risk
   indicate the need to be precautionary about the possibility of
   extinction. and about the criteria used to assess such risk. with
   important implications for research. monitoring and Management. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{We monitored emergence, egress, and ingress of a population of Crotalus
   viridis oreganus from 1982-1990 at a hibernaculum in north central
   Idaho. Snakes were captured by hand and by drift fence traps throughout
   their active season. We made 1071 field observations of snakes, of which
   493 (235 males, 258 females) were individually identified and 578 were
   observed but their identity was not determined. Estimated median maximum
   period of activity was 206 days (1 April to 21 October). Mean date of
   first emergence was not significantly different for males and females,
   and there was no significant difference in mean spring emergence date
   among adult, immature, and newborn snakes. Hand captures of mature males
   occurred mostly in spring and fall. This pattern differed significantly
   from that of mature females, who had three peaks of captures: spring,
   summer, and fail. Captures of snakes in drift fence traps generally
   began a month later than the first hand captures in spring, but the last
   captures iii fall occurred approximately at the same time for both
   methods. Most captures of mature males in drift fence traps occurred in
   summer. We suggest that the hibernaculum was located within the summer
   feeding range of this population of C. v. oreganus. In addition, we
   found a longer active season than might be expected based on latitude
   and altitude of the hibernaculum.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of Ralstonia solanacearum in naturally infested sandy loam
   soil under irrigated rice culture was investigated in Sankhu village
   (1400 m above sea level) in central Nepal. The experimental plot had a
   previous history of bacterial wilt and a range of 1.5 x 10(4) - 3 x
   10(4) colony-forming units (CFU) per g soil was present. The survival of
   R. solanacearum was monitored in roots of naturally growing aquatic
   weeds in the rice plot and in soil before and after rice harvest. The
   incidence of the bacterial infection in the weeds, Dopatrium sp. and
   Monochoria vaginalis, were 57.5 and 10\%, respectively. The bacterial
   population detected in soil before rice harvest was 1.5 x 10(4) CFU per
   g soil whereas a range of 7.5 x 10(2) - 1.5 x 10(3) CFU per g was
   detected after the rice harvest. Biovar typing of R. solanacearum
   isolated from potato plants. potato tubers. aquatic weeds, and the soil

Abstract = {{In Alberta, standardized diurnal call-playback surveys for Western
   Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) were conducted between
   1991-2000 near the town of Hanna, and between 19932000 near the town of
   Brooks. In most years, the Brooks and Hanna surveys encompassed 10 360
   ha and,7060 ha, respectively. Both survey areas are located within the
   historical breeding distribution of Burrowing Owls in predominantly
   native mixed-grass prairie habitat. The Hanna surveys indicated that the
   density of nests ((x) over bar = 13.7 nests per 100 km(2), range =
   2.8-32.6) declined significantly between 1991 and 2000. The decline in
   the Hanna area was most pronounced between 1991 (32.6 nests/100 km(2))
   and 1997 (2.8 nests/100 km(2)) and recent surveys have found few nests.
   The Brooks surveys indicate that the density of nests ((x) over bar =
   8.9 nests/100 km(2), range = 1.9-13.5), although lower than Hanna, did
   not decrease during the course of the surveys. The significant decline
   in Hanna is most likely indicative of the contraction of the northern
   edge of the breeding distribution of Burrowing Owls in Alberta and
   suggests that the population will soon become extirpated from that area.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, little is known about Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia)
   abundance in Wyoming. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WCFD)
   classifies the Burrowing Owl as a Species of Special Concern. We
   identified available data sources to assess Burrowing Owl distribution
   and population trends in Wyoming and conducted a population survey in
   eastern Wyoming. The WGFD's Wildlife Observation System (WOS), initiated
   in 1974, shows a decline in Burrowing Owl records, particularly during
   the 12-yr period 1986-97. However, trends in WOS records over time
   likely reflect changing interest in the database, rather than real
   population trends. Likewise, Breeding Bird Survey data since 1971
   suggest a negative trend, but low numbers warrant caution in
   interpreting these data. Additional monitoring efforts are required to
   assess Burrowing Owl population trend more accurately within the state.
   To evaluate Burrowing Owl abundance at historical nesting locations, we
   surveyed 103 previously reported sites. A total of 18\% of these
   historical sites was reoccupied in 1999. We also surveyed 85 plots
   selected at random from northern mixed- and short-grass prairie types to
   obtain an unbiased picture of Burrowing Owl distribution in eastern
   Wyoming. Only one owl was found on these random survey plots,
   emphasizing the importance of historical nesting sites to Wyoming
   Burrowing Owls.}},

Abstract = {{Operation Burrowing Owl (OBO) is a prairie stewardship program launched
   in Saskatchewan in 1987 to preserve Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia
   habitat from cultivation. As of 2000, 459 OBO members were protecting
   61259 ha of grassland habitat. Of the sites protected, 97\% (466)
   involved privately-owned land (21376 ha) and the remaining sites were
   publicly owned (39 883 ha). Participants signed a voluntary agreement to
   report annually the number of owls on their land and to conserve the
   owls' nesting areas, even if sites became unoccupied. In recent years,
   the program has promoted conservation easements and assisted landowners
   with owl habitat enhancement. In recognition of participation, members
   received a gate sign, an annual newsletter, and educational material. In
   addition to conserving habitat, OBO has increased public awareness of
   the owl, participated in research, and monitored owl population changes.
   In 2000, 459 OBO members reported a total of 54 pairs, considerably
   fewer than the 681 pairs reported by 352 members in 1988. After
   correcting for non-responding members each year, the annual census
   indicated a 95\% decline in estimated number of pairs over 13 yr from
   1988 (1032 pairs) to 2000 (56 pairs); this represents an average decline
   of 21.5\% per year. Between 1987-93, the mean number of sites with
   greater than or equal to5 pairs of owls was 26 (range = 10-42; 5-11\% of
   sites). In contrast, by 2000, 94\% of all formerly occupied sites had
   zero owls, two sites had five pairs (<1\% of sites), and no site had >=

Abstract = {{Two populations of greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, in Backstairs
   Passage and Avoid Bay, collapsed during 30 years of fishing, The former
   population was monitored from 1980 to 1999, and the latter from 1987 to
   1999, Both populations showed strong spatial contraction as their
   respective subpopulations in open habitat failed first compared with
   those in inlets, bays and around islands, where recruitment was higher.
   Stock-recruitment curves are gently sloping or indeterminate, indicating
   weak density-dependence in the one case and high variability in the
   other case. From data gathered during the decline of these populations
   we review various fishery indicators which may be useful for monitoring
   greenlip abalone populations and for predicting collapse, Total catch
   was correlated with relative spawner abundance from survey data, and
   thus appears to be a useful indicator of abundance in this fishery.
   Other useful indicators arc densities and size compositions, from which
   annual recruitment strength and total mortality can be derived, and
   survey evidence of spatial contraction of fished areas. Egg-per-recruit
   analyses are also useful to estimate the extent of departure from
   predetermined safe levels of egg production. Given the fuzzy knowledge
   of the status of populations, several indicators are best used in
   concert to determine management strategies. We propose a ``troublespot
   thermostat{''} approach in which a suite of indicators, sequentially
   triggered off, call for increasingly severe management responses. In
   this way declines can be detected and arrested, and timely steps taken
   to avoid collapse.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of commercial dredging on an oyster reef was evaluated at
   four sites chosen on New Beds, one of the most important commercial
   oyster beds in Delaware Bay. Dredging occur-red on two of these sites in
   late October 1999, early and late November 1999, April 2000, and July
   2000. Dredging was conducted according to standard industry procedures.
   Each day, dredging was continuous during approximately an 8-h period.
   Both one-dredge and two-dredge boats were used. Market-size oysters were
   culled and sacked in the standard manner. Total dredge coverage for the
   study was about 240,000 m(2) on each experimental site. The most heavily
   dredged areas were completely covered by the dredge 4 to 6 times during
   the study. Two 8-h dredging events within a 10-day period produced
   barely detectable changes in the oyster population. Minor chipping and
   abrasion of the shell increased in frequency, but no other discernible
   impacts were found. Over the 10-mo study that included five dredging
   events, many of the taphonomic indicators of dredge damage showed
   time-dependent trends that differed between control and experimental
   sites. However, these effects were limited mostly to minor chipping and
   indications of abrasive wear, rather than the more serious aspects of
   shell damage defined as major chipping, breakage, cracking, and shell
   perforation. A variety of population health indicators were assayed
   during the study, including the ratio of live oysters to boxes,
   condition index, Perkinsus marinus infection intensity, and oyster
   size-frequency distribution, These indicators should have monitored
   growth, disease pressure, and mortality. Essentially no significant
   effects could be discerned for any of these measures. Over a very long
   time, dredging may significantly influence oyster bed physiography and
   community structure. However, once the bed has become a fished bed, this
   study suggests that moderate dredging that results in a yearly swept
   area of no more than four times the area of the bed is unlikely to
   result in significant further impact on the oyster populations living
   there.}},

Abstract = {{Gymnodinium catenatum blooms were first detected on the Venezuelan

   presence of this organism and to measure environmental parameters
   (temperature and salinity) that may be associated with its appearance,
   G. catenatum has been observed every year along the coast, with maximum
   abundance between June and October. Blooms of G. catenatum (< 1.000
   cells ml(-1)) have been recorded only in the northeastern coast during
   the rainy season (July - Nov.) when water temperature was above
   25degreesC and salinity was 36.5 to 38parts per thousand. The lowest
   abundance (< 100 cells - ml(-1)) occurred from Dec. - June in a wide
   range of temperature (22-28degreesC) and salinity (33.2-39parts per
   thousand). The species has been less abundant in the Gulf of Cariaco and
   has not formed blooms yet. The dynamics of the marine environment at the
   north coast seem to favor the growth of G. catenation populations,
   Shellfish toxicity showed different PSP levels and did not always
   coincide with the presence of G. catenatum.}},

Abstract = {{High CO and NO, concentrations have been documented in homes with
   unvented combustion appliances, such as natural gas fireplaces. In
   addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are emitted from
   incomplete natural gas combustion. The acute health risks of CO and NO2
   exposure have been well established for the general population and for
   certain high-risk groups, including infants, the elderly, and people
   with heart disease or asthma. Health effects from PAH exposure are less
   well known, but may include increased risk of cancer.
   We monitored CO emissions during the operation of unvented natural gas
   fireplaces in two residences in Boulder, CO, at various times between
   1997 and 2000. During 1999, we expanded our tests to include
   measurements of NO, and PAH. Results show significant pollutant
   accumulation indoors when the fireplaces were used for extended periods
   of time. In one case, CO concentrations greater than 100 ppm accumulated
   in under 2 hr of operation; a person at rest exposed for 10 hr to this
   environment would get a mild case of CO poisoning with an estimated 10\%
   carboxyhemoglobin level. Appreciable NO2 concentrations were also
   detected, with a 4-hr time average reaching 0.36 ppm. Similar
   time-average total PAH concentrations reached 35 ng/m(3). The results of
   this study provide preliminary insights to potential indoor air quality
   problems in homes operating unvented natural gas fireplaces in Boulder.}},

Abstract = {{The coexistence of three taxa of Codium (Chlorophyta: Codiaceae) was
   examined on wave-swept shores of western Ireland: the introduced
   macroalgae Codium fragile ssp. atlanticum and ssp. tomentosoides and the
   native Codium tomentosum. In spring 1999 and 2000, four sites were
   monitored to evaluate whether past predictions regarding temporal
   changes and species replacement occurred. Introduced and native species
   of dichotomously branching Codium occurred at four tidal levels: in
   tidepools in (i) the upper barnacle zone; (ii) the mid barnacle/fucoid
   zone; (iii) the mussel zone, and (iv) on emergent substrata in the red
   algal turf/kelp zone. Codium fragile ssp. atlanticum and ssp.
   tomentosoides grew together in 11.9\% of surveyed pools containing
   Codium. Compared to 1971 censuses, C. fragile ssp. atlanticum had
   increased in relative abundance at all tidal levels, and the dominance
   of C fragile ssp. tomentosoides had declined. The native C. tomentosum
   constituted the same percentage of the population as it did in 1971.
   Pool availability and primary rock surfaces were not limiting at most
   sites, indicating that inter-subspecific and inter-specific competition
   could not account for temporal changes in Codium distribution on Irish
   shores. Ecological constraints other than intra-generic competition may
   have contributed to the purported long-term changes in Codium abundance.}},

Abstract = {{The coast of Honduras, Central America, represents the southern end of
   the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, although its marine resources are
   less extensive and studied than nearby Belize and Mexico. However, the
   coastal zone contains mainland reef formations, mangroves, wetlands,
   seagrass beds and extensive fringing reefs around its offshore islands,
   and has a key role in the economy of the country. Like most tropical
   areas, this complex of benthic habitats experiences limited annual
   variation in climatic and oceanographic conditions but: seasonal and
   occasional conditions, particularly coral bleaching and hurricanes, are
   important influences. The effects of stochastic factors on the country's
   coral reefs were clearly demonstrated during 1998 when Honduras
   experienced a major hurricane and bleaching event. Any natural or
   anthropogenic impacts on reef health will inevitably affect other
   countries in Latin America, and vice versa, since the marine resources
   are linked via currents and the functioning of the system transcends
   political boundaries. Much further work on, for example, movement of
   larvae and transfer of pollutants is required to delineate the full
   extent of these links.
   Anthropogenic impacts, largely driven by the increasing population and
   proportion of people living in coastal areas, are numerous and include
   key factors such as agricultural run-off, over-fishing, urban and
   industrial pollution (particularly sewage) and infrastructure
   development. Many of these threats act synergistically and, for example,
   poor watershed management via shifting cultivation, increases
   sedimentation and pesticide run-off onto coral reefs, which increases
   stress to corals already affected by decreasing water quality and coral
   bleaching. Threats from agriculture and fishing are particularly
   significant because of the size of both industries. The desire to
   generate urgently required revenue within Honduras has also led to
   increased tourism which provides an over-arching stress to marine
   resources since most tourists spend time in the coastal zone. Hence the
   last decade has seen a dramatic increase in coastal development, a
   greater requirement for sewage treatment and more demand for freshwater,
   particularly in the Bay Islands.
   Although coastal zone management is relatively recent in Honduras, it is
   gaining momentum from both large-scale initiatives, such as the Ministry
   of Tourism's `Bay Islands Environmental Management Project', and
   national and international NGO projects. For example, a series of marine
   protected areas and legislative regulations have been established, but
   management capacity, enforcement and monitoring are limited by funding,
   expertise and training. Existing and future initiatives, supported by
   increased political will and environmental awareness of stakeholders,
   are vital for the long-term economic development of the country. (C)

Abstract = {{The Kenya coast is bathed by the northward-flowing warm waters of the
   East Africa Coastal Current, located between latitudes I and 5 degrees
   S. With a narrow continental shelf, the coastal marine environments are
   dominated by coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves, with large
   expanses of sandy substrates where river inputs from Kenya's two largest
   rivers, the Tana and Athi rivers, prevent the growth of coral reefs. The
   northern part of the coast is seasonally influenced by upwelling waters
   of the Somali Current, resulting in lower water temperatures for part of
   the year. The coast is made up of raised Pleistocene reefs on coastal
   plains and hills of sedimentary origin, which support native habitats
   dominated by scrub bush and remnant pockets of the forests that used to
   cover East Africa and the Congo basin. The marine environment is
   characterized by warm tropical conditions varying at the surface between
   25 degreesC and 31 degreesC during the year, stable salinity regimes,
   and moderately high nutrient levels from terrestrial runoff and
   groundwater. The semi-diurnal tidal regime varies from 1.5 to 4 m
   amplitude from neap to spring tides, creating extensive intertidal
   platform and rocky-shore communities exposed twice-daily during low
   tides. Fringing reef crests dominate the whole southern coast and parts
   of the northern coast towards Somalia, forming a natural barrier to the
   wave energy from the ocean. Coral reefs form the dominant ecosystem
   along the majority of the Kenya coast, creating habitats for seagrasses
   and mangroves in the lagoons and creeks protected by the reef crests.
   Kenya's marine environment faces a number of threats from the growing
   coastal human population estimated at just under three million in 2000.
   Extraction of fish and other resources from the narrow continental
   shelf, coral reef and mangrove ecosystems increases each year with
   inadequate monitoring and management structures to protect the resource
   bases. Coastal development in urban and tourist centers proceeds with
   little regard for environmental and social impacts. With a faltering
   economy, industrial development in Mombasa proceeds with few checks on
   pollution and other impacts. In 1998 Kenya's coral reefs suffered
   50-80\% mortality from the El Nino-related coral bleaching event that
   affected the entire Indian Ocean. The institutional, human resource and
   legal infrastructure for managing the coastal environment has in the
   past been low, however these are rapidly improving with the
   revitalization of national institutions and the passing in 1999 of an
   Environment Act. Marine Protected Areas are the key tool currently used

Abstract = {{Seabirds aggregate around oil drilling platforms and rigs in above
   average numbers due to night lighting, flaring, food and other visual
   cues. Bird mortality has been documented due to impact on the structure,
   oiling and incineration by the flare. The environmental circumstances
   for offshore hydrocarbon development in North-west Atlantic are unique
   because of the harsh climate, cold waters and because enormous seabird
   concentrations inhabit and move through the Grand Banks in autumn
   (storm-petrels, Oceanodroma spp), winter (dovekies, Alle alle, murres,
   Uria spp), spring and summer (shearwaters, Puffinus spp). Many species
   are planktivorous and attracted to artificial tight sources. Most of the
   seabirds in the region are long-distance migrants, and hydrocarbon
   development in the North-west Atlantic could affect both regional and
   global breeding populations. Regulators need to take responsibility for
   these circumstances. It is essential to implement comprehensive,
   independent arm's length monitoring of potential avian impacts of
   offshore hydrocarbon platforms in the North-west Atlantic. This should
   include quantifying and determining the nature, timing and extent of
   bird mortality caused by these structures. Based on existing evidence of
   potential impacts of offshore hydrocarbon platforms on seabirds, it is
   difficult to understand why this has not been, and is not being,
   systematically implemented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Common Toad Bufo bufo is a wide-ranging species, with a distribution
   encompassing much of Europe and Asia. Few molecular studies have been
   undertaken on this species, and only one polymorphic microsatellite

   variability within and between B. bufo populations. The value of such

Abstract = {{The susceptibility of Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa
   decemlineata) (CPB) from three provinces in western Canada was measured
   using a filter paper bioassay to substantiate the reported insecticide
   resistance by the beetle in Manitoba, and to compare the situation there
   to beetle populations from Saskatchewan and Alberta. Susceptibility of
   beetles was measured against five insecticides: the organophosphates,
   azinphos-methyl (Guthion), and methamidophos (Monitor); the pyrethroid,
   permethrin (Ambush); the organochlorine, endosulfan (Endosulfan); and
   the carbarnate, carbaryl (Sevin). All 12 populations tested from
   Manitoba were found to have resistance to one or more of the
   insecticides. All populations were classified as either having
   resistance or intermediate resistance to permethrin; two of the
   populations were classified as having resistance to azinphos-methyl and
   three to methamidophos. Two of four populations from Saskatchewan were
   classified as having intermediate resistance to azinphos-methyl and
   methamidophos. Intermediate resistance to permethrin was recorded in 12
   of the 13 populations from Alberta, with only one being highly
   susceptible. Two populations showed evidence of intermediate resistance
   to azinphos-methyl and three to methamidophos. In all three provinces,
   survival rate from different egg masses within the susceptible
   populations ranged from 0-100\%, indicating the presence of individuals
   with either resistance, intermediate or high susceptibility within these
   populations. With the expanding potato acreage in western Canada and the
   detection of the CPB populations with resistance to insecticides, a
   resistance management program must be implemented to prevent the rapid
   selection of resistant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Recreational and other human activities degrade coral reefs worldwide to
   a point where efficient restoration techniques are needed. Here we
   tested several strategies for gardening denuded reefs. The gardening
   concept consists of in situ or ex situ mariculture of coral recruits,
   followed by their transplantation into degraded reef sites. In situ
   nurseries were established in Eilat's (Northern Red Sea) shallow waters,
   sheltering three types of coral materials taken from the branching
   species Stylophora pistillata (small colonies, branch fragments, and
   spat) that were monitored for up to two years. Pruning more than 10\% of
   donor colonies' branches increased mortality, and surviving colonies
   displayed reduced reproductive activity. Maricultured isolated branches,
   however, exceeded donor colony life span and reproductive activity and
   added 0.5-45\% skeletal mass per year. Forty-four percent of the small
   colonies survived after 1.5-year mariculture, revealing average yearly
   growth of 75 +/- 32\%. Three months ex situ maintenance of coral spat
   (sexual recruits) prior to the in situ nursery phase increased
   survivorship. Within the next 1.5 years, they developed into colonies of
   3-4 cm diameter. Nursery periods of 2 years, 45 years, and more than >5
   years have been estimated for small colonies, spat, and isolated
   branches, respectively. These and other results, including the possible
   use of nubbins (minute fragments the size of a single or few polyps),
   are discussed, revealing benefits and drawbacks for each material. In
   situ coral mariculture is an improved practice to the common but
   potentially harmful protocol of direct coral transplantation. It is
   suggested that reef gardening may be used as a key management tool in
   conservation and restoration of denuded reef areas. The gardening
   concept may be applicable for coral reefs worldwide through
   site-specific considerations and the use of different local coral
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Strains of the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), and bollworm,
   Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), collected in Mississippi in 1996 through 1999,
   were evaluated in bioassays to four classes of chemical insecticides and
   a biological product (Bt), Bacillus thuringensis Berliner. Stable, high
   frequencies of resistance in tobacco budworm were found to cypermethrin,
   methomyl, and thiodicarb; toxicity of Bt remained low but unchanged.
   Three years of tobacco budworm data against spinosad, representing a new
   class of insecticides, showed no reduction in susceptibility from one
   year to the next. Bollworm colonies showed little consistent change in
   tolerance for the 4-year period, but 1999 data indicated a slight but
   not significant decrease in susceptibility to cypermethrin and
   profenofos. Profenofos was equally as effective as spinosad against both
   species. Continued monitoring will be necessary to verify subsequent
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Fifteen cDNA sequences are reported for the European coniferous forest
   tree species Norway spruce {[}Picea abies (L.) Karst.], including the
   results of similarity searches in public electronic databases. The
   sequences were subsequently employed for the design of specific primer
   pairs and PCR-based amplification of genomic fragments. For seven primer
   pairs, polymorphic EST-PCR markers were identified among 18 trees. Their
   mode of inheritance was verified by analysing single-tree offspring and
   studying segregation among haploid endosperms in comparison to diploid
   tissue. Codominant inheritance was indicated for six markers, while one
   marker was apparently dominant. Variation of the six codominant EST
   markers was tested by genotyping 110 randomly selected trees in a
   Bavarian Norway spruce population. For comparison, the same trees were
   genotyped at 18 enzyme coding gene loci. There were 3.33 alleles per
   locus for EST markers and 3.00 for isoenzyme gene markers. In general, a
   trend to more even frequency distributions and larger intrapopulational
   variation, including observed heterozygosities, was indicated more for
   EST markers than for isoenzyme gene markers. The benefits of these newly
   developed EST-PCR markers are outlined with respect to population
   genetics and ecological genetics.}},

Abstract = {{Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) wintering in the
   southeast delta of Arkansas were monitored via aerial surveys to
   determine their numbers and distribution. At least two surveys per month
   (December 1999-April 2000) were conducted. Each survey was comprised of
   two separate afternoon flights to cover the study area during the
   evening roosting period. Most of the two flights making up each survey
   were flown on consecutive days to reduce possible movement of cormorants
   between the two flight routes. December through February surveys all
   exceeded 15,000 individuals, except for early January, when there was an
   appreciable drop in numbers. The cormorant numbers peaked in early
   February at 26,822 individuals. During this study, cormorants utilized a
   total of ten night roosts within this catfish-producing region of
   Arkansas. This study area in southeast Arkansas encompasses the primary
   production acreage for the Arkansas catfish industry and is a likely
   attractant for the Double-crested Cormorant. This collection of baseline
   population data is important in researching the relation of the Catfish
   (Ictalurus punctatus) industry to growing cormorant numbers. These data
   will also provide a valuable base line in assessing cormorant population
   changes that might occur due to any future management strategies adopted
   by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.}},

Abstract = {{Managing ungulate populations in a sustainable way requires monitoring
   plans to provide useful information about population status and trend.
   Our aim is to evaluate the use of hunters to collect information about
   the status of caribou Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus in Greenland.
   Caribou have been harvested under a quota system since 1995 in four
   regions of west Greenland. In each year, hunters were asked to return
   information on the sex, approximate age and body condition of animals
   harvested, and lower jawbones were collected from animals shot in 1995.
   The harvest is strongly sex-biased (90:10) towards males. Jawbone length
   did not vary among regions. Age-specific tooth wear was, however, most
   pronounced in the northern region (Sisimiut-Kangerlussuaq), probably due
   to the nature of the substrate in the area. The condition of animals,
   based on a rump-fat index, appears to be good over all west Greenland,
   with some slight but consistent differences between regions. We conclude
   that information provided by hunters will be useful in monitoring the
   caribou populations, but validation of their information is required.}},

Abstract = {{Remotely triggered cameras have been used in many ecological studies,
   but most are relatively inexpensive one-time-only systems or expensive
   infrared systems. We describe the setup and wiring technique for a
   moderately priced, multiple-photo camera system. Two study areas,
   California and Vermont, were used to assess usefulness of the camera
   system. Although some target carnivore species were photographed
   regularly, visitation rates of other carnivores were low, due either to
   low population densities or camera shyness. Cameras generally worked
   well under all conditions, but the pressure-plate triggering devices
   sometimes became inoperable during heavy rains. Other camera activation
   systems may reveal additional uses for this remote camera system.}},

Abstract = {{Usual counts of deer populations generally show low reliability,
   especially at the high-density levels deer have recently reached in most
   parts of Europe. Since 1990, researchers and managers have looked for
   index methods to replace counts. Monitoring vegetation changes over time
   in response to deer browsing could be useful for managers to index deer
   abundance. We assessed the feasibility of using Aldous-derived
   vegetation surveys to monitor the population-habitat interaction over
   time. We first developed an original statistical procedure to define a
   reliable measure of deer browsing. Then we applied our browsing index to
   a case study involving a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population that
   was monitored intensively over 18 years and increased 5-fold in size.
   Our browsing index closely tracked the roe deer population size, the
   species-specific browsing rates differed widely, and bramble (Rubus sp.)
   could be reliably used to assess total browsing pressure of roe deer.
   Because it is an easy tool to use and involves much lower costs than
   traditional counts, our browsing index can be viewed as an efficient and
   reliable indicator of ecological change according to deer population
   status.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the incidence of male incubation and multiple brooding in
   Sagebrush Brewer's Sparrows (Spizella breweri breweri) at the
   northwestern limit of their breeding range in southern British Columbia,
   1998-2000, and in central Washington, 1996-1999. Males frequently
   incubated eggs, accounting for 28\% of 329 observations of incubation by
   known individuals in British Columbia. In Washington, 51\% of the males
   we monitored incubated eggs. Males and females appeared equally able to
   increase nest temperature. In British Columbia, 17\% of females fledged
   two broods per season, and two females fledged three broods. In
   Washington, 5\% of males fledged two broods per season. Only one
   previous case of male incubation has been reported in this species and
   multiple brooding has been poorly documented. These aspects of the
   breeding biology of other well-studied species may be underestimated
   without the careful examination of populations of marked individuals.}},

Title = {{Avoidance responses to aluminium in the freshwater bivalve Anodonta

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effect of aluminium (Al) on the filtering
   behaviour (shell opening or gape) of the freshwater bivalve Anodonta
   cygnea L in neutral fresh water. Parallel measurements of Al
   concentration in the soft tissues were made to examine the relationship
   between changes in behaviour and accumulation of Al. The number of
   lysosomal granules in the gill, kidney and digestive gland were counted,
   as lysosomes are known to be involved in the excretion and
   detoxification of trace metals. The bivalves were exposed to two
   environmentally relevant concentrations of added Al i.e. 250 and 500 mug
   l(-1) (9.25 and 18.5 muM l(-1)) at neutral pH for 15 days and shell
   movement monitored continuously. Aluminium affected the mussels'
   filtering activity, producing an avoidance reaction whose magnitude was
   concentration-dependent; 250 mug l(-1) added Al produced no detectable
   change, while 500 mug l(-1) Al reduced mean duration of shell opening by
   50\%. This effect was irreversible over a 15 day recovery period. Tissue
   levels of Al after 15 days exposure were an order of magnitude higher in
   animals exposed to 250 mug l(-1) added Al than in those exposed to 500
   mug l(-1). This was consistent with the inhibition of filtering activity
   due to valve closure at the higher concentration, which may have
   prevented uptake of Al. In addition, probable different chemical
   speciation of Al in the water column (soluble for 250 and colloidal for
   500 mug l(-1) may lead to marked differences in tissue uptake. The
   kidney and digestive gland were the main sites of accumulation of Al and
   concentrations remained significantly elevated 15 days after transfer of
   animals to clean water. It is suggested that mucus plays a role in the
   exclusion of Al as elevated concentrations were measured in the
   pseudofaeces of animals during and after exposure. Lysosomal granules
   may be involved in the intracellular handling and detoxification of Al
   as numbers increased significantly in all organs during exposure and
   continued to increase after the animals were transferred to clean water.
   The present study provides evidence for the bioavailability and toxicity
   of Al to mussels at neutral pH and at concentrations which are known to
   enter neutral freshwaters when mobilised by natural or anthropogenic
   acidity. The changes in behaviour and uptake of Al in the mussel
   observed in this investigation are, therefore, likely to be reflected in
   the natural environment and the degree to which Al affects the `fitness'
   of the mussel populations and the transfer of Al through the food chain
   merit investigation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motor vehicles are a significant source of airborne polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH) in many urban areas. Traditional approaches used in
   determining the relative contributions of individual vehicle types to
   the total amount of PAH in air have been based on the analysis of
   integrated samples of airborne particles and gases for the presence of
   chemical tracers indicative of the vehicles from which the chemicals
   derived. As an alternative, we have used a photoelectric aerosol sensor
   (PAS) capable of measuring PAH levels in real-time in the emissions
   plumes from motor vehicles. We placed the PAS near a traffic-light in
   Kenmore Square, a busy crossroads in downtown Boston (MA, USA). A video
   camera co-located at the site recorded the vehicles passing the sensor,
   and this record was correlated with the PAS data. During a 5-day
   monitoring period (similar to 59 h) in the summer of 1998, over 34 000
   motor vehicles were counted and classified and over 24000 PAS readings
   were recorded (frequency 1/8.6 s). The composition of the vehicle
   population was 94\% passenger vehicles, 1.4\% buses, 2.6\% small trucks,
   1.3\% medium trucks, 0.35\% large trucks, and 0.45\% garbage and
   construction trucks. In analyzing the PAS data, it was assumed that the
   highest PAS measurements - those that exceeded the 95\% critical level
   of the 5-min moving average of all the PAS measurements - were
   indicative of primary vehicular emissions. We found that similar to 46\%
   of the mass of particle-bound PAH (i.e. similar to 46\% of the
   integrated area under the PAS signal vs. time plots) was attributable to
   primary emissions from motor vehicles passing the sensor. Of this,
   35-61\% was attributable to passenger vehicles (cars, pickup trucks, and
   sports utility vehicles) and 39-65\% was attributable to non-passenger
   vehicles {[}buses (14-23\%). small trucks (12-20\%), medium trucks
   (8.4-14\%), large trucks (2.9-4.8\%) and garbage and construction trucks
   (1.9-3.2\%)]. Our results suggest that on a per vehicle basis. buses and
   trucks - the majority of which run on diesel fuel - emitted greater
   amounts of particle-bound PAH than passenger vehicles. Overall, we found
   that real-time photoelectric aerosol sensing (in combination with video
   photography) is useful for estimating the contributions of airborne PAH
   from different vehicle types. Due to the physical constraints of our
   monitoring site and the high volumes of traffic, however, it was not
   possible to uniquely attribute PAS signals to individual vehicles. (C)

Abstract = {{In order to investigate a specific area of short-term, non-occupational,
   human exposure to fine particulate air pollution, measurements of
   personal exposure to PM2.5 in transport microenvironments were taken in
   two separate field studies in central London, UK. A high flow
   gravimetric personal sampling system was used, operating at 161 min(-1);
   the sampler thus allowed for sufficient sample mass collection for
   accurate gravimetric analysis of short-term travel exposure levels over
   typical single commute times. In total., samples were taken on 465
   journeys and 61 volunteers participated. In a multi-transport mode
   study, carried out over 3-week periods in the winter and in the summer,
   exposure levels were assessed along three fixed routes at peak and
   off-peak times of the day. Geometric means of personal exposure levels
   were 34.5 mug m(-3) (G.S.D. = 1.7. n(s) = 40), 39.0 mug m(-3) (G.S.D. =
   1.8, n(s) = 36) 37.7 mug m(-3) (G.S.D. = 1.5. n(s) = 42). and 247.2 mug
   m(-3) (G.S.D. = 1.3, n(s) 44) for bicycle, bus, car and Tube
   (underground rail system) modes, respectively, in the July 1999 (summer)
   measurement campaign. Corresponding levels in the February 2000 (winter)
   measurement campaign were 23.5 mug m(-3) (G.S.D. 1.8, n(s) 56), 38.9 mug
   m(-3) (G.S.D. 2.1, n(s) = 32), 33.7 mug m(-3) (G.S.D. = 2.4, n(s) = 12),
   and 157.3 mug m(-3) (G.S.D 3.3, n(s) 12), respectively. In a second
   study, exposure levels were measured for a group of 24 commuters
   travelling by bicycle, during August 1999, in order to assess how
   representative the fixed route studies were to a larger commuter
   population. The geometric mean exposure level was 34.2 mug m(-3) (G.S.D.
   = 1.9, n(s) = 105). In the fixed-route study, the cyclists had the
   lowest exposure levels, bus and car were slightly higher, while mean
   exposure levels on the London Underground rail system were 3-8 times
   higher than the surface transport modes. There was significant
   between-route variation, most notably between the central route and the
   other routes. The fixed-route study exposure was similar in level and in
   variability to the `real' commuters study, suggesting that the routes

Abstract = {{Indicators used by the ``Harmony with Nature{''} chapter of the ``4th
   State of the Nation Report{''} (SOTNR) for monitoring biodiversity in
   Costa Rica were reviewed in order to assess its value as a monitoring
   tool. They were compared with the framework and indicators proposed by
   the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice
   (SBSTTA) of the Convention on Biological Diversity of which Costa Rica
   is a party. The SOTNR included state, pressure and use-response
   indicators for four different types of ecosystems: forest,
   marine-coastal, freshwater and agricultural systems. However, very few
   indicators related to species and genetic level were available. More
   information and indicators for forest and agricultural systems existed
   than for other types of ecosystems. Some indicators-ecosystems quantity,
   population density or infrastructure-were not desegregated by type of
   ecosystem. A main limitation of the report was the non-availability of
   ecosystem quality indicators. Suggestions are made for the inclusion of
   a fuller set of indicators to ensure that impact and sustainability can
   be monitored comprehensively at different levels of scale. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Colony mortality and productivity were compared between honey bee (Apis

   mites (Acarapis woodi or Varroa destructor). Mortality, bee and mite
   populations, sealed brood, and stores were monitored for 16 months,
   beginning in May. By the following March, 5 out of 6 colonies with both
   mites were dead, but no other colonies died until September, when 3 out
   of 4 V. destructor colonies were dead. Dually infested colonies
   initially had more honey stores, but were dead by March. At that point
   V. destructor colonies had significantly less worker brood, fewer adult
   bees and more honey than colonies with no mites or tracheal mites
   (Acarapis woodi). The colonies with tracheal mites (n = 9) and no mites
   (n = 8) did not differ in any productivity parameter measured. These
   results suggest a synergistic interaction between tracheal and V.
   destructor mites, treatments against tracheal mites should be applied in

   Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand}},

Abstract = {{1. With the establishment of the 619-ha Long Island-Kokomohua Marine
   Reserve in April 1993, a biological monitoring programme designed to
   investigate changes due to the total no-take legislation applied to the
   reserve was initiated.
   2. Size, distribution and behaviour of blue cod (Parapercis colias;
   Pinguipedidae) were investigated using baited hooks at reserve and
   control rubble bottom habitats annually from 1993 to 2000. Blue cod
   abundance was estimated using visual diver strip transects annually for
   a period of 9 years from 1992 to 2001.
   3. A total of 5628 blue cod (2436 reserve and 3192 control specimens)
   were captured, measured and released. Two years after the reserve was
   established, the average size of blue cod was 22.4 mm larger inside the
   reserve compared with control sites outside it.
   4. Over the duration of the study, the mean length of blue cod captured
   using baited hooks increased in the no-take reserve, but declined at the
   control sites, By the end of the study, in April 2000, the proportion of
   large blue cod > 330 mm in length in the reserve was 35\% compared with
   < 1\% at the control sites, where recreational fishing activities
   occurred.
   5. Blue cod catch rates from experimental fishing in the reserve
   increased within 11 months of removal of recreational fishing activities
   and continued to increase up to 47 months, in contrast to the control
   areas where recreational fishing was permitted, catch rates remained
   consistently low. Increased catch rates in the reserve were not due to
   increased blue cod abundance, rather an increase in the proportion of
   naive fish in the population.
   6. From March 1998 to the end of the study, the density of blue cod in
   the reserve was significantly higher compared with the control sites.
   This increase was primarily due to an increase in the density of larger
   blue cod > 300 mm length in the reserve and a corresponding small
   decline in the density of these larger fish at the control sites.
   7. It is concluded that the cessation of recreational fishing in the
   reserve had resulted in an increase in blue cod size, catch rate and
   abundance and also in a change to blue cod behaviour. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Residents near the Trecatti landfill site located in South Wales, United
   Kingdom, expressed concern about odors and health effects they
   attributed to site emissions. The authors compared routinely collected,
   population-based, health data from potentially exposed electoral wards
   (i.e., United Kingdom electoral tracts) with data from both wards
   nearby, matched for socioeconomic deprivation scores, and with wards
   where residents were likely to attend the same hospital. Mortality rates
   were higher for all causes and neoplastic diseases (but not respiratory
   disease) in the exposed wards, but there was no change in rates after
   the site opened. Hospital data revealed a transient increase in
   admissions for asthma during the 3 yr that preceded the peak in odor
   complaints. The birth prevalence of congenital malformations was raised
   in the exposed wards, but the authors could not exclude a possible
   artifact resulting from differences in reporting practices between
   hospitals. The absence of environmental monitoring in the community
   during the period of public concern was a significant weakness of this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{NOx and NO2 concentrations were measured at different locations in a
   city centre of an urban zone (Population 450000) in order to study the
   variation of the outdoor exposure at pedestrian level. These
   measurements were carried out to understand the influence of traffic
   emissions at each measured site. The observations were done during four
   weeks in winter, including several days with high pollution levels. The
   results at different locations have been used to analyse criteria
   recommended for locating observation sites in a monitoring network. No
   large differences in background pollution averaged over several weeks
   have been found throughout the city centre, even during pollution peaks.
   Measurements were also carried out inside one street canyon. The
   contribution of the street traffic to the NO=NOx-NO2 concentrations
   observed at side-walk has been found important, i.e., several times the
   background level. On the other hand, the majority of observed NO2
   pollution is due to the contribution of background pollution within the
   street. The pollutant excess at pedestrian level is strongly correlated
   to the street traffic emission and to the atmospheric turbulence
   observed at roof level. Application of a box model to the street data
   demonstrates that such models can be useful to estimate the pollutant
   accumulation within the street. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The management of wild gamebirds for shooting involves a combination of
   habitat management (woodland, field boundaries and grime crops), winter
   feeding and control of potential nest predators, airy of which could
   benefit other birds, including nationally declining species associated
   with farmland habitats. Changes ill numbers of passerines were monitored
   over six years ill relation to genie management oil farmland ill
   Leicestershire. Nest success was monitored over four years and, for
   sortie species, was inversely related to abundance of breeding corvids.
   Abundance of breeding passerines increased during the period of game
   management. Species whose breeding populations have declined nationally
   (coincident with agricultural intensification) showed the greatest
   increases ill abundance relative both to other species, and to the same
   nationally declining species ill nearby farmland. The precise mechanism
   by which the game management package contributes to increased breeding
   numbers is riot understood and is likely to differ between species.
   However; these results show that further integration of wild game
   management into farming systems could have conservation benefits for
   nationally declining farmland birds.}},

Abstract = {{Chondrus canaliculatus (C. Agardh) Greville used to cover extensive
   areas at Puerto Aldea 30 degrees 16' S, 71 degrees 30' W), Tongoy Bay,
   Chile. The exploitation of this commercially-valuable alga without
   knowledge of its production behavior and reproductive characteristics
   led to its severe reduction in the area. Seasonal monitoring of biomass,
   reproductive capacity and reproductive potential of an intertidal and a
   subtidal population of C. canaliculatus from this locality was performed
   in order to gather information on how to manage this resource. Total and
   fertile frond biomass both have a maximum (4 and 2.5 Kg per m(2)
   respectively) in spring-summer and a minimum (2.4 and 1.8 Kg per m(2)
   respectively) during winter. Both were also higher in the subtidal
   (maxima of 4.2 and 2.6 Kg per m(2)) than in the intertidal population
   (maxima of 4.0 and 2.6 Kg per m(2)) and carposporic fronds were always
   more abundant than tetrasporic fronds. Reproductive capacity (based on
   the number of spores per sorus, the number of sori per frond and the
   fertile biomass per area unit) followed a similar seasonal pattern
   reaching a maximum of 5.5 x 10(9) spores per m(2) and was higher in the
   intertidal than in the subtidal and in tetrasporic rather than
   carposporic plants. Laboratory studies of spore settlement and survival
   indicated that the reproductive potential was not different between
   reproductive phases and between habitats. This potential, close to 30\%
   in relative terms, is similar to those evaluated in other members of the
   Gigartinaceae. Maxima of total and reproductive biomass, spore
   production, spore settlement and juvenile survival occurred one to two
   months earlier in the intertidal than in the subtidal. The data
   available at this point suggests that the harvesting of the fronds
   should be done in different periods for the intertidal (early and
   mid-summer) and the subtidal (mid- to late summer) and approximately a
   month after the spore productivity peak when these have already been
   released, assuming that the recovery of biomass is through the growth of
   new individuals. Further studies on vegetative means of growth and
   maintenance of the populations should be added to this information in
   order to propose an adequate management of this resource.}},

Abstract = {{The spruce beetle, Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby), has possible life
   cycles of 1 or 2 years. Empirical and experimental evidence suggest that
   temperature is the primary regulator of these life-history pathways.
   These different life cycles potentially result in substantial
   differences in population dynamics and subsequent spruce mortality. A
   multiyear field study was conducted in Utah, Colorado, and Alaska, to
   monitor spruce beetle development under a variety of field conditions
   with concurrent air temperature measurements. This information was used
   to model the tree- or stand-level proportion Of univoltine beetles as a
   function of air temperature. Temperatures were summarized as averages,
   cumulative time, and accumulated heat units above Specified thresholds
   over various seasonal intervals. Sampled proportions of univoltine
   insects were regressed against the summarized temperature values in
   logistic models. The best predictive variable, as evaluated by Akaike's
   Information Criterion, was found to be cumulative hours above a
   threshold of 17 degreesC elapsed from 40 to 90 days following peak adult
   funnel-trap captures. Because the model can be used to forecast trends
   in spruce beetle populations and associated spruce mortality, it is a
   tool for forest planning.}},

Abstract = {{Three pairs of the endangered Cabrera vole, Microtus cabrerae, which is
   endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, were captured in the wild and reared
   in captivity. They did not breed under standard laboratory conditions,
   and bred only under conditions similar to those found in wild colonies.
   Six litters were obtained and a total of 24 pups were monitored. Five
   external variables were measured and timing of 11 developmental events
   was recorded for each pup until it was 80 days old. Litter size was 4.0
   +/- 0.89 (mean +/- SE; range = 3-5) pups per female, falling within the
   range reported for other Microtus species. Litter size of M. cabrerae
   was lower in the laboratory than in the field. Female body mass was
   correlated with litter mass at birth. Newborns were heavy (3.5 g, on
   average) compared with those of other Microtus species because of the
   relatively large size of adult M. cabrerae. Timing of the main
   developmental events followed a similar pattern to that observed for
   other species of the genus. Juvenile M. cabrerae grew fast in length
   during lactation, rapidly increasing their body mass during postweaning.
   Observations on parental behaviour in rearing pups support the
   previously published hypothesis that the species is monogamous. A global
   assessment of our results suggests that M. cabrerae should be included
   among the species that use the K strategy of reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of exposure to a non-chemical (temperature) or chemical
   (organophosphate insecticide) stressor during larval development were
   compared in Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Stress was measured in
   two ways: using conventional life history traits (survival, development
   time and a measure of body size) and by calculating the degree of
   developmental instability from the departure from bilateral symmetry of
   wing characters (fluctuating asymmetry). Increasing insecticide dose,
   but not temperature, was observed to elevate wing fluctuating asymmetry
   in male but not female mosquitoes, Insecticide treatment reduced
   survival and was associated with a significant reduction in wing trait
   sizes in both females and males but did not significantly affect
   development time. Temperature was associated with a significant
   reduction in all life history traits in both sexes. Therefore wing
   fluctuating asymmetry in C quinquefasciatus cannot be used as a general
   biomonitor of all stress, although it may have potential as a more
   specific monitor of chemical stress. It needs to be complimented with
   other measures such as life history and biochemical methods. The
   significant differences in response between sexes may impact on results
   of short-term larval exposures to insecticides. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Within any particular landscape. patch structure and dynamics likely
   will differ among habitat types because of environmental differences
   influencing the intensity and outcome of biological interactions. We
   compared the dynamics of natural and experimentally constructed mussel
   patches (Mytilus trossulus and M. edulis) in two intertidal habitats,
   tidepools and emergent rock, over a time series (5, 10, 15 mo) and among
   seasons (three successive 5-mo intervals). In tidepools, mussels
   naturally occurred in small patches (median < 25 cm(2)). In contrast,
   mussels on emergent rock formed extensive beds with decimeter-scale
   gaps., but these beds start as small patches following disturbance such
   as ice scour. For our experimental patches (15 cm(2)) in both habitats,
   we assessed the relative importance of physical (wave disturbance) and
   biological (predation, growth, recruitment, and immigration) processes
   in determining patch size and structure. Although individual
   experimental and natural patches varied greatly in size over time, mean
   patch area remained relatively constant. In general, mean size of
   individuals in experimental patches decreased due to the loss of larger
   mussels while numbers increased due to recruitment. Wave disturbance,
   which removes and redistributes mussels, appeared to be more important
   than predation (by the whelk Nucella lapillus) in determining patch
   structure and dynamics on this shore, although losses due to either
   process did not differ consistently between habitats over time.
   Individual growth rates were low (shell length less than or equal to0.4
   mm/mo) but greater in tidepools than on emergent rock, whereas
   recruitment and immigration rates generally did not differ between
   habitats. Although each process contributed to changes in patch size and
   structure, collectively they did not result in a marked divergence in
   mean patch area or biomass between tidepools and emergent rock over the
   15-mo experiment. We suggest that the broad patterns of distribution and
   abundance of mussels develop slowly on this shore largely because of low
   individual growth rates. Over time scales of years, however, positive
   relationships between individual growth and recruitment rates and patch
   size may accelerate the expansion of aggregations on emergent rock.
   Mussel assemblages at our site differ from those examined in many other
   studies in terms of the relative importance of wave dislodgment and
   predation as causes of loss and in the role of growth in offsetting
   these losses, This study shows how integrative approaches, with
   monitoring of patches and individuals within patches, can provide
   detailed mechanistic understanding of patch structure and dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury is not commonly considered a household air pollutant; however, a
   number of potential sources of the metal exist in residential settings,
   Eleven of 12 indoor sites sampled in this study showed levels of
   airborne mercury that were significantly elevated over outdoor
   concentrations (range 6.5-523 ng m(-3)). In addition, this and other
   published research suggest that up to 10\% of households may have levels
   of airborne mercury above the U.S. EPA reference concentration (300 ng
   m(-3)) due to historic accidents with mercury containing devices.
   Exposure to mercury via indoor air is seen as second only to fish
   consumption as a source of mercury in the general population. Large
   seasonal changes in indoor mercury levels were identified in this study
   suggesting that short-term monitoring of mercury-contaminated sites is
   not sufficient to adequately assess the potential health risks and
   effectiveness of remediation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{We developed procedures for using Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to
   model habitat and population viability of selected at-risk fish and
   wildlife species. The BBN models represent the ecological causal web of
   key environmental correlates (KECs) that most influence habitat
   capability, potential population response for each species, and
   influence of habitat planning alternatives. BBN models represent
   site-specific KECs, habitat capability at the subwatershed level, and
   pattern of habitat capability across all subwatersheds. BBNs use
   Dirichlet prior probability distributions and standard Bayesian updating
   of posterior probabilities. We derived estimates of prior and
   conditional probabilities from a mix of empirical data and expert
   judgment, mostly the latter. Sensitivity analyses identified planning,
   decisions and KECs that most influence species outcomes, and can help
   prioritize monitoring activities. BBN models, however, substitute for
   neither field studies nor empirical, quantitative population viability
   analyses of population demography and genetics. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{1. Population characteristics (density, size, reproductive patterns) of
   the predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes cederstroemii in south-east Lake
   Michigan were monitored at an offshore station (110 m) in 1995-98 and at
   a nearshore station (45 m) in 1997-98.
   2. The mean density of B. cederstroemii at the offshore station was
   generally highest in July-September (145-914 m(-2)) and at the nearshore
   station in October-November (168-1625 m(-2)). In 1995 and 1998, density
   was also high at the offshore station in November (211-284 m(-2)). Fish
   predation may limit B. cederstroemii in nearshore regions in the summer.
   The maximum annual densities of B. cederstroemii for 1995-98 were
   generally similar to those reported from the late 1980s, when the
   species arrived in Lake Michigan.
   3. Body size increased rapidly each year to a maximum in August.
   Thereafter, body size declined and converged for stage-2 and 3
   individuals, suggesting food scarcity or size-selective fish predation
   was affecting large individuals.
   4. Most reproduction occurred asexually (90\%), and by stage 2 or 3
   females (99\%). Asexual brood size was highest when B. cederstroemii
   first appeared each year, and decreased in August, when larger neonates
   were produced. There appeared to be differences in reproductive mode for
   stage 2 and 3 females, with a higher percentage of stage 2 females
   reproducing sexually.}},

Abstract = {{1. Algal taste and odour is usually associated with open water blooms
   and eutrophic systems. However, some algal species can produce high
   biomass under ice-cover, even at low nutrient concentrations, that can
   impact water quality. This paper describes a winter odour outbreak in
   oligotrophic Glenmore Reservoir (Calgary, Alberta, Canada), the major
   algal species, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and some treatment
   implications.
   2. Using sensory, chemical and microscope analyses, we monitored odour,
   algal biomass and taxa, bacteria and major nutrients. In a preliminary
   assessment of the effectiveness of standard water treatment with this
   type of algal biomass and odour, we used bench-scale tests and sampled
   raw water from the Glenmore treatment plant at successive treatment
   stages.
   3. In the winter of 1999-2000 Glenmore ice-cover was delayed, nutrients
   were characteristically low (TP < <similar to>5 mug L-1), but organic
   carbon and bacteria were higher than in previous years.
   4. During this period there was an increase in algal biomass dominated
   by the mixotrophic chrysoflagellate Dinobryon divergens. Temporal
   dynamics of this species were inversely correlated with bacteria, and
   biomass declined following the establishment of ice-cover, while depth
   profiles showed the highest abundance at subsurface layers. This
   suggested that the population outbreak was triggered by high bacteria
   abundance but depended on a minimum amount of light, consistent with in
   vitro studies of other mixotrophic chrysophytes.
   5. Other non-bactiverous taxa were also numerous, notably Asterionella
   formosa, cryptomonads, dinoflagellates and the synurophyte Synura
   petersenii.
   6. Raw water odour was characteristically fishy, mainly caused by the
   VOCs 2,4,7-decatrienal, 2,4-heptadienal and 2,4-decadienal. Based on
   algal population and VOC dynamics, these compounds were attributed to
   Dinobryon. Trace amounts of 2,6-nonadienal (S. petersenii) and 1,3,5 and
   1,3,6-octatriene (A. formosa) were also detected. It was concluded that
   2,4,7-decatrienal was the major source of the raw water odour.
   7. Sensory and microscopic analyses of pre- and post-treatment samples
   in the treatment plant indicated a complete removal of odour, but only a
   30-60\% removal of algal biomass and evident rupture of residual algal
   cells. Laboratory experiments showed that using standard treatment,
   chlorination rapidly oxidized 2,4,7-decatrienal and 2,6-nonadienal but
   had little effect on 2,4-hepta- and decadienal.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred and twenty-two AFLP markers were mapped using an IR64 x
   Azucena rice doubled-haploid (DH) population. The distribution of these
   mapped markers was monitored across a set of 48 diverse landraces of
   rice. Strong statistical associations were observed between 960 of the
   7381 possible pairs of markers across the diverse material. These 960
   strongly associated pairs of markers mapped to the same chromosomes in
   only 111 cases. The remaining 849 pairs were the result of association
   between markers found on different chromosomes. More than 21\% of these
   genetically unlinked but strongly associated markers are not randomly
   distributed across the genome but instead occupy blocks of DNA on
   different rice chromosomes. Amongst associated blocks, there has clearly
   been maintenance of combinations of marker alleles across very diverse
   germplasm. Analyses have also revealed that markers are found in
   association with performance for each of four quantitative traits in
   both the diverse landrace material and a DH mapping population. It is
   proposed that the present data provide strong evidence for the
   co-adaptation of geographically distinct landraces and that this has
   resulted over time in the maintenance of `adaptive gene complexes'
   involving agronomically important quantitative traits.}},

Abstract = {{Free-living nematodes inhabiting a sandy beach exposed to strong ocean
   waves were sampled at bimonthly intervals for two years. Six 1.3-litre
   core samples were taken on each occasion down to a depth of 60 cm. The
   numbers of each species and their status as juveniles, males and females
   (with or without eggs) was recorded. In the common species all these
   stages occur throughout the year, but the population increases in the
   warmer months of the year and falls to a much lower level in winter.
   Most species are dispersed throughout the sand to a depth of at least 60
   cm, but several species where almost always found below the water table
   at about 60 cm. The faunal composition of the nematode assemblages
   changed significantly from month to month. Additional samples were taken
   to monitor the effects of very strong waves coupled with a very high
   tide which remodelled the beach. The nematode fauna was partially
   reconstituted by this event. It is concluded that the intertidal beach
   fauna is a dynamic extension of the near shore sub-littoral nematode
   fauna.}},

Abstract = {{An enclosure study was conducted in Ranger Lake in south-central
   Ontario, Canada from 4 July to 5 August 1997 to determine predation
   effects of the larvae of the phantom midge fly Chaoborus on the
   zooplankton community. Zooplankton assemblages were established in 12
   enclosures (2 m in diameter, 7.5 m deep). Three densities of
   fourth-instar Chaoborus trivittatus (0 l(-1), 0.1 l(-1) and 0.5 l(-1))
   were introduced as predator treatments to the enclosures. Temperature,
   dissolved oxygen and zooplankton community composition were monitored
   for six weeks. To determine if the zooplankton community composition
   changed, a repeated measures multivariate analysis was performed on
   percent biomass of Bosmina and calanoid copepods. There were no
   significant differences in mean taxon percent biomass among predator
   treatments. There were significant differences in mean taxon percent
   biomass between water layers (epilimnion and metalimnion). There were
   also significant differences in lengths of Bosmina and calanoid copepods
   among predator treatments at the end of the experiment. Crop content
   analysis of C. trivittatus showed that Bosmina constituted 88-98\% of
   the prey items found in the crops. These results demonstrate that the
   use of deep enclosures, a Chaoborus species which vertically migrates,
   and lower natural densities of Chaoborus may provide prey with an
   important natural refuge from predation and so allow a more accurate
   determination of the predation impact of Chaoborus trivittatus in
   temperate lakes where fish control Chaoborus densities.}},

Abstract = {{1. Within Caughley's (1994) declining population paradigm for
   conservation, we develop a realistic method of detecting population
   changes using floor and ceiling population models.
   2. A theoretical framework for detecting declining populations is
   presented and applied to four ungulate species from Kruger National
   Park, South Africa.
   3. Census data are fitted to a non-linear autoregressive population
   model. Based on this model two auxiliary models, called the floor and
   ceiling models, are derived. These models predict the upper and lower
   threshold densities (or abundance values) for the non-linear population
   model.
   4. Threshold floor and ceiling estimates can be used as a benchmark for
   monitoring population status. In particular, when abundance values
   (densities) tend to fall below the floor estimate, this may merit
   concern that a population is declining.
   5. In conjunction with appropriate response by management, the presence
   of such an early warning system may prevent a population from becoming
   low in numbers, possibly making it less susceptible to stochastic
   processes and a less likely candidate for local extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Location, aims Long Island's biota was destroyed by volcanic eruption in
   c. 1645, and Motmot, an emergent island in its caldera lake, was
   re-created in 1968, providing a nested pair of natural colonization
   sequences. In 1999 we surveyed the plants and vertebrates of Long and
   the entire biota of Motmot for comparison with previous surveys of Long
   (1932, 1972, birds only) and Motmot (1969-88).
   Results The known flora of Long is 305 vascular plants (thirty-two
   pteridophytes, 273 spermatophytes), including thirty-one Ficus species,
   the sixteen fruiting all having pollinating wasps, and there were eleven
   species of effective fig dispersers. There were two frog species, a
   crocodile, a monitor, seven skinks, four geckos, a boid snake, fifty
   species non-migrant land birds, seven bats, two rats, a cuscus (probably
   introduced) and feral pigs, dogs, cats and chickens.
   Most of Motmot's surface was barren or sparsely vegetated ash, cinder
   and lava fields. There were seven pteridophyte and thirty-eight
   spermatophyte species, including eight Ficus, and the cumulative known
   flora comprises eleven pteridophytes and fifty-one spermatophytes,
   mainly zoochorous and anemochorous, with sedges, grasses and herbs
   predominating. All Ficus individuals but one were small; three plants of
   two species bore syconia but had not been pollinated and had not set
   seed. Motmot's known invertebrate fauna comprises thirty-five species,
   mainly predators and scavengers; two spider and one ant species
   dominating. An insectivorous bat and eight land bird species (three
   breeding) were the only vertebrates.
   Main conclusions Long's biota comprised mainly widely distributed
   species with broad ecological tolerances, well-adapted for colonizing
   species-poor islands. The mid-level caldera plateau, as in 1932, was
   covered in fairly open forest of similar-sized trees with a few much
   larger individuals and little or no understorey. Primary rain forest
   tree species from the region were under-represented or absent but
   secondary forest species were common. There were few regional endemic
   Ficus species. The avifauna comprised species with good dispersal
   ability, lacked endemic subspecies and probably for at least the past
   seven decades has been held at a quasi-equilibrium of fifty species,
   fourteen below the theoretical number. More than half the fifty-four
   resident land birds known from Long (and three of the seven bats) are
   high class tramps in the sense of Diamond; only two birds are high-S
   species. Turnover has been low and none of the bird supertramps has been
   replaced. The non-avian fauna comprised mostly high-category tramp-type
   species with relatively broad habitat requirements and extensive
   geographical ranges. Non-volant vertebrates comprised a number of highly
   vagile species associated with humans. Several groups, especially snakes
   and amphibians, were depauperate compared with the fauna of other
   islands in the area. Long's biota is evidently held at an arrested stage
   of development by some physical factor, possibly the extremely porous
   substratum and relatively dry climate.
   The allochthonous input of lake insects to Motmot evidently provides the
   major energy source for its animal communities, with a very minor
   contribution from organic flotsam. Reflecting Motmot's very isolated
   situation, plant colonization has been slow, but when more fig
   individuals mature and fig-wasp populations become established fruit
   production should attract frugivores and start a positive feedback
   process which will accelerate the growth of Motmot's community.
   Long's colonization shows similarities with that of Krakatau (Sunda
   Strait, Indonesia) after the 1883 eruption, and species shared by the
   two include a high proportion of pioneer species. Motmot's triple
   isolation (sea, land and fresh-water barriers) means that its
   colonization differs markedly from those on two marine emergent islands

Abstract = {{The distribution of PM2,5 and manganese (Mn) personal exposures was
   determined over a 4-month period in Indianapolis, IN, at a time when the
   gasoline additive, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT),
   was not being used. The data collection period coincided with the data
   collection period in the Toronto, ON, study, where MMT had been used as
   a gasoline additive for over 20 years. The inferential or target
   population consisted of noninstitutionalized residents of the
   Indianapolis area during the monitoring period (from May 1996 through
   August 1996) who were at least 16 years old. The survey instruments used
   in this study (and also in Toronto) included a household screener form
   (HSF), a study questionnaire (SQ), and a time and activity questionnaire
   (TAQ). The SQ was administered to elicit information about the
   participant and his/her activities, occupation, and surroundings that
   might be relevant to his/her exposure to particles and Mn. In addition
   to the personal particulate matter (PM) and elemental 3-day monitoring,
   240 participants completed a TAQ on a daily basis during; the actual
   monitoring period. Also, a subset of participants had 3-day outdoor and
   indoor stationary monitoring at their home (approximately 58
   observations), and sampling was conducted at a fixed site (approximately
   thirty-three 3-day observations). The quality of data was assessed and
   compared to the Toronto study in terms of linearity of measurement,
   instrument and method sensitivity, measurement biases, and measurement
   reproducibility. Twenty-six of the sample filters were subjected to two
   analyses to characterize the within-laboratory component of precision in
   terms of relative standard deviations (RSDs). The median RSD for Mn was
   8.7\%, as compared to 2.2\% for Toronto. The quality assurance (QA)
   laboratory exhibited a clear positive bias relative to the primary
   laboratory for AI and Ca, but no systematic difference was evident for
   Mn. A high interlaboratory correlation ( >0.99) was also attained for
   Mn. Mean field blank results for PM and Mn were 0.87 mug/m(3) and 0.71
   ng/m(3), respectively, which were comparable to the Toronto study. The
   median RSDs for colocated fixed site and residential samples ranged from
   2.2\% to 9.0\% for PM and from 8.8\% to 15.3\% for Mn, which were close
   to those observed in Toronto. For the PM10, the 90th percentile indoors
   was 124 mug/m(3) compared with 54 mug/m(3) outdoors. This pattern was
   even more pronounced for the PM2.5 data (90th percentiles of 92 mug/m(3)
   indoors vs 30 mug/m(3) outdoors). Personal PM2.5 was somewhat higher
   than the indoor levels, but the percentiles seemed to follow the more
   highly skewed pattern of the indoor distribution. This difference was
   largely due to the presence of some smokers in the sample; e.g.,
   exclusion of smokers led to a personal exposure distribution that was
   more similar to the outdoor distribution. The estimated 90th percentile
   for the nonsmokers' personal exposures to PM was 43 mug/m(3) compared
   with 84 mug/m(3) for the overall population.
   In general, the Indianapolis PM levels of a given type and cut size were
   somewhat higher than the levels observed in Toronto, e.g., the median
   and 90th percentile for the personal PM2.5 exposures were 23 and 85
   mug/m(3), respectively, in Indianapolis, while in Toronto, the
   corresponding percentiles were 19 and 63 mug/m(3). The cities'
   distributions of the proportion of the PM10 mass in the 2.5-mum fraction
   appeared similar for the residential outdoor data (medians of 0.67 and
   0.65 for Indianapolis and Toronto, respectively, and 90th percentiles of
   0.83 for both cities). For the indoor data, Indianapolis tended to have
   a larger portion of the mass in the tine fraction (median of 0.80
   compared to 0.70 for Toronto). Unlike the PM, the Indianapolis indoor Mn
   concentration levels were substantially lower than the outdoor levels
   for both PM sizes, and the median personal levels for Mn in PM2,5
   appeared to fall between the median indoor and outdoor levels. The
   personal Mn exposure distributions exhibited more skewness than the
   indoor or outdoor distributions (e.g., the means for the personal,
   indoor, and outdoor distributions were 7.5, 2.6, and 3.5 ng/m(3),
   respectively, while the medians were 2.8, 2.2, and 3.2 ng/m(3),
   respectively). At least a substantial portion of the high end of the
   personal exposure distribution appeared to be associated with
   occupational exposures to Mn. In general, the Mn levels in both cut
   sizes in Indianapolis were approximately 5 ng/m(3) smaller than those in
   Toronto (e.g., the estimated median and mean levels for personal Mn
   exposures in PM2.5 were 2.8 and 7.5 ng/m(3), respectively, in
   Indianapolis, but were 8.0 and 13.1 ng/m(3) in Toronto). For the
   nonoccupational subgroups with no exposure to smoking and no subway
   riders in the two cities, the medians (2.6 ng/m(3) in Indianapolis and
   7.8 ng/m3 in Toronto) were similar to those for the overall populations,
   but the means were substantially smaller (3.1 ng/m(3) in Indianapolis
   and 9.2 ng/m(3) in Toronto). The median proportion of Mn in the fine
   fraction (relative to the PM10 Mn) for Indianapolis was 0.39 for
   outdoors and 0.55 for indoors; these ratios were somewhat smaller than
   the corresponding Toronto medians (0.52 and 0.73). The study found high
   correlations for particulates and Mn between personal exposures and
   indoor concentrations, and between outdoor and fixed site
   concentrations, and low correlations of personal and indoor levels with
   outdoor and fixed site levels. The pattern was similar to that observed
   for Toronto, but slightly more pronounced. The PM10 Mn concentrations (
   log scale) generally exhibited stronger associations among these various
   measures than the PM2.5 Mn concentrations. Comparisons of the
   particulate distributions between PTEAM (Riverside, CA) and the
   Indianapolis and Toronto studies were also made.}},

Abstract = {{Recent prospective cohort studies have suggested that long-term exposure
   to low levels of particulate matter (PM) air pollution is associated
   with increased mortality due to, especially, cardio-pulmonary disease.
   Exposure to ambient air pollution was estimated mostly as city average
   concentrations, assuming homogenous exposure within the city, We used an
   ongoing cohort study - The Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) on diet and
   cancer - to investigate the relationship between traffic-related air
   pollution and mortality. The baseline data collection took place in
   1986. A study was conducted to develop methods for exposure assessment
   and evaluate the contrast in exposure to air pollution within the
   cohort. Assessment of long-term exposure to two traffic-related air
   pollutants, Black Smoke (BS) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), consisted of
   separate estimation of regional background, urban background, and local
   traffic contributions at the home address. Interpolation of
   concentration data from a routine monitoring network was used to
   estimate the regional background concentration. A regression model
   relating degree of urbanization to air pollution was used to allow for
   differences between different towns/neighborhoods of cities. Distance to
   major roads was calculated to characterize local traffic contributions,
   using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Interpolation resulted in
   reasonably precise regional background estimation when distant sites
   were not used and distance squared was used as the weight.
   Cross-validation showed that prediction errors were about 15\% of the
   range in regional background concentration. Urban and local scales
   contributed significantly to the contrast within the cohort. Prediction
   errors for estimating the urban background were about 25\% of the range
   in background concentrations. When the developed model was applied to
   the study cohort, there was substantial contrast in estimated exposure
   to BS and NO2. About 90\% of the study population lived 10 years or more
   at its 1986 home address - supporting the use of the estimated
   concentration at the 1986 address as a relevant exposure variable.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria (and possibly archaea) accelerate silica dissolution in the sea
   by colonizing and enzymatically degrading the organic matrix of diatom
   frustules. We tested whether colonizer species composition and
   ectohydrolase profiles critically control silicon regeneration by
   allowing diatom (Thalassiosira weissflogii and Chaetoceros simplex)
   detritus to be colonized by natural bacterial assemblages and 12
   phylogenetically characterized marine isolates. We characterized the
   colonizers' ectohydrolase profiles and rates of silicon regeneration.
   The colonizers' cell-specific protease activity was consistently the
   dominant ectohydrolase, and it strongly correlated with silica
   dissolution rates. Cell-specific glucosidase, lipase, and chitinase
   activities showed no correlation with silicon regeneration. Denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes was
   used to monitor colonization of detritus by natural microbial
   assemblages and to identify colonizing phylotypes. Representatives from
   gammaproteobacteria and sphingobacteria-flavobacteria classes dominated
   colonizer populations by comprising 65\% and 25\% of detected
   phylotypes, respectively. Archaea were not detected among colonizer
   populations. All bacterial isolates accelerated silica dissolution, but
   individual rates varied by >300\%. Significant variability was observed
   within the Alteromonadaceae, which indicates different abilities to
   process diatom organic matter. Isolates that displayed enhanced
   colonization and protease activities were the most effective at
   regenerating silicon. The most effective isolate belonged to the
   sphingobacteria-flavobacteria, a group specialized in colonizing marine
   particles. Other effective isolates grouped with Pseudoalteromonas,
   Alteromonas, and Vibrio genera. One isolate caused intense aggregation
   of diatom detritus, significantly reducing silicon regeneration. Our
   results indicate that bacterial species identity strongly controlled
   silicon regeneration by influencing the colonization potential and
   ectohydrolytic profiles of bacteria as well as aggregate formation.
   Mechanistic models of oceanic silica cycling should incorporate species
   composition and ectohydrolase profiles of bacteria involved in silicon
   regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{The green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) was inserted into the
   chromosome of Pseudomonas spp. Cam-1 and Sag-50G, two psychrotolerant
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-degrading bacteria. The gfp-transformed
   microorganisms, designated Cam-1-gfp1, Cam-1-gfp2, Sag-50G-gfp1, and
   Sag-50G-gfp2, exhibited green fluorescence under an epifluorescent
   microscope. The gfp was inserted into the chromosome of each
   psychrotolerant strain and was stable with no apparent adverse affects
   on the metabolism and growth of each organism. Activity of
   gfp-transformed microorganisms against biphenyl and 2,3-dichlorobiphenyl
   was determined by assaying for BphC activity and by resting cell assays.
   The patterns of BphC activity at two different growth temperatures in
   batch cultures were similar for each of the gfp-transformed
   microorganisms. Resting cell assays of both the parent strains (Cam-1,
   Sag-50G) and the gfp-transformed strains (Cam-1-gfp1, Cam-1-gfp2,
   Sag-50G-gfp1, Sag-50G-gfp2), grown on glycerol or glucose, exhibited
   BphC activity to a lesser extent and at a slower rate than those
   observed for biphenyl grown cells. In addition, all gfp-transformed
   microorganisms degraded 2,3-dichlorobiphenyl (2,3-DCB) in broth to the
   same extent as the parent strains. When Cam-1-gfp1 and Sag-50G-gfp1 were
   used as a bioremediation amendment in soil microcosms spiked with
   2,3-DCB, both strains survived in high numbers (5.6 to 7.9 log cfu g(-1)
   and 5.6 to 8.0 log cfu g(-1)) when inoculated into nonsterilized soil
   over 16 weeks at 22 degreesC and 18 weeks at 4 degreesC, respectively.
   Biodegradation of 2,3-DCB was enhanced with the microbial amendment;
   however, the addition of sunflower oil did not help the PCB degrading
   bacteria and may have enhanced the growth of the indigenous population,
   thereby decreasing the amended PCB-degrading population.}},

Abstract = {{Effective population size (N-e) is an important concept in the
   management of threatened species like bull trout Salvelinus confluentus.
   General guidelines suggest that effective population sizes of 50 or 500
   are essential to minimize inbreeding effects or maintain adaptive
   genetic variation, respectively. Although N-e strongly depends on census
   population size, it also depends on demographic and life history
   characteristics that complicate any estimates. This is an especially
   difficult problem for species like bull trout, which have overlapping
   generations biologists may monitor annual population number but lack
   more detailed information on demographic population structure or life
   history. We used a generalized, age-structured simulation model to
   relate N-e to adult numbers under a range of life histories and other
   conditions characteristic of bull trout populations. Effective
   population size varied strongly with the effects of the demographic and
   environmental variation included in our simulations. Our most realistic
   estimates of N-e were between about 0.5 and 1.0 times the mean number of
   adults spawning annually. We conclude that cautious long-term management
   goals for bull trout populations should include an average of at least
   1,000 adults spa ning cacti year. Where local populations arc too small,
   managers should seek to conserve a collection of interconnected
   populations that is at least large enough in total to meet this minimum.
   It will also be important to provide for the full expression of life
   history variation and the natural processes of dispersal and gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, reduction of the taking of nontarget species in
   fisheries worldwide has received considerable attention. Bycatch
   mortality in pot fisheries has led to severe declines in local
   populations of the diamondback terrapin Malaclemys terrapin along the
   U.S. East Coast. We conducted a 4-year study between 1997 and 2000 to
   investigate the impact of four bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), wire
   rectangular devices fitted into the entrance of crab traps, on
   diamondback terrapin bycatch mortality as well as its effect on the
   harvest of blue crabs Callinectes sapidus in the Delaware River estuary.
   A total of 52 sets consisting of five replicate blue crab pots for each
   BRD treatment (5.0 X 10.0, 5.0 X 12.0, 4.5 X 12.0, and 3.8 X 12.0 cm)
   and controls were deployed at random in 10 tidal tributaries and inland
   bays within the Delaware estuary. During this study 372 diamondback
   terrapins, and 3,522 legal-size blue crabs were caught. The 5-cm X 12-cm
   BRD was the only treatment for which the reduction in overall
   diamondback terrapin catches (-12\%) was not statistically significant.
   In crab pots fitted with the 5-cm X 10-cm BRD, we observed a
   statistically significant (P < 0.01) reduction in terrapin catches
   (-59\%) versus control pots, with no statistical difference in blue crab
   catches. Only a nominal loss (-12\%) of legal-size blue crab catches was
   observed in pots fitted with the 4.5-cm X 12.0-cm BRD, whereas the
   reduction in diamondback terrapin captures (38\% male and 96\% female)
   was significant (P < 0.01). No diamondback terrapins were captured in
   the smallest BRD (3.8 X 12.0 cm), but the losses of legal-size blue crab
   catches were substantial (26\%). We therefore recommend the use of the
   4.5-cm X 12.0-cm BRD with recreational crab pots as a conservation
   measure because this would effectively protect all subadult and
   reproductive female diamondback terrapins with minimal loss of legal
   blue crabs. We also stress the importance of using the BRDs in concert
   with other conservation measures, such as efforts directed at monitoring
   the effects of BRD implementation on bycatch mortality and preservation
   of nesting.}},

Abstract = {{In Puerto Rico, unique protocols are used during fishing tournaments for
   largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. Live wells are not required, and
   many anglers retain their catch on metal stringers. During day
   tournaments, fish are collected and weighed by a roving weigh-in bout;
   night tournaments use a central weigh-in station. We monitored 15
   fishing tournaments over I year in Lucchetti Reservoir, Puerto Rico, to
   quantify mortality rates and to evaluate the impact of tournaments on
   the adult fish population. Initial mortality was documented at weigh-in,
   and delayed mortality was determined by holding largemouth bass for 4 d
   in floating mesh pens with control (electrofished) largemouth bass.
   Initial and delayed mortality averaged 8\% (range, 0-38\%) and 43\%
   (10-98\%), respectively. The delayed mortality rate was adjusted by the
   control mortality rate (mean, 7\%; range, 0-50\%) for each tournament to
   yield adjusted delayed mortality rate (mean, 36\%; range, 10-68\%),
   which we used to calculate total mortality rate (mean, 42\%; range,
   13-68\%). Although surface water temperature ranged only between
   23degreesC and 28degreesC, total mortality was significantly lower (P
   less than or equal to 0.05) during January-February, being positively
   correlated with temperature. Night tournaments experienced significantly
   greater total mortality rates than day tournaments, most likely because
   of the eightfold longer retention of bass before weigh-in during night
   tournaments. Retention time was positively correlated with initial
   mortality rates. We estimated that tournament mortality removed 6\% of
   the adult largemouth bass population and accounted for 23\% of all
   fishing mortality. We recommended reducing tournament fishing during
   hotter, high-mortality periods; modification of night tournaments; and
   use of well-maintained live wells. Combined with angler education, such
   modifications of tournament procedures can reduce the impact of
   tournaments in tropical reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{Spawning interactions among fertile male, female, and sterilized male
   sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus were examined by placing externally
   attached radiotransmitters on 4\% (52 animals) of the population of sea
   lampreys that was introduced above a barrier to their passage in the
   Carp River, which flows into Lake Superior, during 1996 and 1997.
   Movements and interactions on nests made by sea lampreys were monitored
   using portable receivers for up to 20 d from the start of nest
   construction. Four times as many nests from the same number of
   introduced animals were found in 1996 than in 1997. Two sea lampreys
   with radio transmitters emigrated from the stream in 1996, and 13
   animals emigrated or were missing from the stream in 1997 when a freshet
   occurred just before spawning. Only three male sea lampreys with
   transmitters were observed spawning, and these males visited more than
   one nest. We continuously checked four or more nests each year and
   observed that each nest was built, altered, or destroyed several times
   by sea lampreys. We suggest that fertile and sterile male sea lampreys
   have low fidelity to a nest or to a female and that a nest may contain
   reproductive products from different parents.}},

   voles, Microtus agrestis: the importance of inherited environmental

Abstract = {{Reproductive traits of voles vary with the phases of the population
   density fluctuations. We sought to determine whether the source of this
   variation resides in the individuals or in their environment.
   Overwintering field voles (Microtus agrestis) from two cyclic
   out-of-phase populations (increase and peak phases) were sampled in
   early spring and bred in the laboratory for two generations under
   standardised conditions with ambient light and temperature. Monitoring
   of the source populations by capture-mark-recapture showed large
   differences in reproductive performance. In the increase area,
   reproduction started six weeks earlier, the probability of maturation of
   young-of-the-year was more than ten times higher during mid-summer, and
   reproduction continued nearly two months later in the autumn than in the
   peak area. These differences were not found to be associated with a
   difference in age structure of overwintered animals between the two
   areas (assessed by the distribution of eye lens masses from autopsy
   samples). Although the population differences in reproductive traits
   were to some degree also present among the overwintered animals in the
   laboratory, we found no difference in reproductive traits in the
   laboratory-born generations. There was a strongly declining seasonal
   trend in probability of sexual maturation both in the field and in the
   laboratory under ambient light conditions. However, in the field there
   were large population differences in the steepness of the seasonal
   decline that were not seen under the standardised laboratory conditions.
   We conclude that seasonal decline in maturation rates is governed by
   change in photoperiod, but that the population level variation in the
   shape of the decline is caused by a direct response to the environment
   and not due to variation in any intrinsic state of the individuals
   reflecting the environment experienced by the previous generation(s).}},

Abstract = {{Data on population size, breeding success and diet composition of gentoo
   (Pygoscelis papua), magellanic (Spheniscus magellanicus) and rockhopper
   (Eudyptes chrysocome) penguins, collected as part of the Falkland Island
   Seabird Monitoring Programme from 1986/1987 to 1998/1999, were analysed
   with regard to spatial and temporal variation, as well as potential
   interaction with local commercial fisheries. No significant population
   trends were detectable, mainly because of the short time-series and
   large spatial and inter-annual variation in the number of breeding pairs
   in the colonies monitored. However, the breeding success of all three
   penguin species has improved slightly over the last few years,
   indicating a potential for increasing populations in the near future.
   During the breeding season, all three penguin species preyed
   opportunistically on a mixture of fish, squid and crustaceans. Diet
   composition too showed a high degree of spatial and temporal variation.
   However, in all three penguin species studied, squid gradually
   disappeared from the diet over successive years, to be replaced by fish.
   Coincidentally, the commercial catches of the squid species Loligo gahi
   in Falkland Islands waters decreased and the by-catch of nototheniid
   fish increased. All three penguin species compete directly with the
   commercial fishing fleet for L. gahi; however, there may also be
   competition for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), hake
   (Merluccius sp.) and southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis),
   because juveniles of these species were found regularly in penguin
   diets.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we analysed the factors affecting species richness and
   introduced species component patterns in native fish faunas of 30
   streams of the Middle Basin of the Guadiana River. From a principal
   component analysis and a stepwise multiple regression analysis performed
   on a data matrix composed of ten hydrological and biotic variables, we
   showed that: (1) fish species richness increased with stream length and
   watershed area, (2) the number of native species in a stream declined as
   channelizations and river regulation (constructions of dams) are higher,
   whereas introduced species increased in the same way, (3) the two main
   negative factors affecting native ichthyofaunas affected dissimilar
   ecological areas: channelizations, which depend on land-use intensity of
   floodplain, mainly occurred in lower reaches of streams, but
   construction of dams mainly took place in upper sections of rivers, (4)
   the length of the remaining well-preserved reaches in a stream appeared
   to be the only factor accurately predicting native fish species
   richness, and (5) native fish faunas of small isolated streams are more
   vulnerable to habitat alteration than those of large streams. Both
   isolation and fragmentation of populations were recorded, so the
   conservation status of native and highly endemic fish fauna of the study
   area is extreme. Protection of the few still extant, well-preserved
   small streams and upper reaches, habitat restoration of channeled areas,
   and inclusion of the need for native fish fauna conservation in
   long-term public planning of water use become a priority. Fish
   communities appear to be a sensitive indicator of biological monitoring
   to assess environmental degradation. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The Suwannee River, Florida, population of the Gulf of Mexico sturgeon
   Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi, a subspecies of Atlantic sturgeon A.
   oxyrinchus oxyrinchus, was evaluated using a capture-recapture approach
   and an age-structured model to examine Population trends from 1986
   through 1995. The capture-recapture analysis revealed a positive rate of
   change (lambda) in the adult population, indicating that it was slowly
   increasing front the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. The age-structured
   model revealed that the population was highly sensitive to changes in
   egg-to-age-1 mortality. the percentage of females that spawn annually,
   and adult mortality, The model predicted that even slight increases in
   annual adult mortality (from 16\% to 20\%) would result in a decline in
   the Suwannee River Gulf sturgeon population. Population trends were
   consistent for both modeling procedures and were similar to those in
   published reports. Although this population is currently expanding, care
   should be taken to protect adult fish from any fishing or bycatch
   mortality. Given the particular attributes of Gulf sturgeon (such as
   late sexual maturation, the fact that few mature females spawn each
   year, and high early life mortality), managers should be patient and
   willing to monitor populations for extended periods of time (similar to
   20 years) to detect changes in the adult population.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of polluted Onondaga Lake, New York, to early stages of a
   phased program to rehabilitate the lake from the effects of domestic
   waste inputs are documented. The analysis is based on more than 10 years
   of paired monitoring of the effluent (total ammonia and total
   phosphorus) of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that discharges to
   the lake as well as the lake itself (including total ammonia, nitrite,
   total and dissolved forms of phosphorus, plankton biomass and
   composition, Secchi disc transparency, and zebra mussel density). Major
   reductions in total ammonia and total phosphor-us loading relative to
   the preceding decade are reported for the WWTP for the November 1998
   through October 1999 interval. Dramatic and, in some cases,
   unanticipated changes in the lake's water quality and biota in response
   to the reductions in loading are documented for the April to October
   interval of 1999 including: (1) major decreases in total ammonia
   concentrations and improved status with respect to ammonia toxicity
   standards, (2) development of dense populations of zebra mussels, (3)
   decreases in fall concentrations of nitrite and improved status with
   respect to the related toxicity standard, (4) decreases in total
   phosphorus and total dissolved phosphor-us concentrations, and (5) a
   severe Microcystis (phytoplankton) bloom that caused nuisance conditions
   and poor clarity. The zebra mussel invasion is attributed to the
   reductions in total ammonia concentrations to below toxic levels. The
   Microcystis bloom was probably related to the abrupt increase in the
   zebra mussel population. Additional reductions in phosphorus loading
   from the WWTP will be required to limit phytoplankton production and
   avoid the potential for continued nuisance conditions. Potential
   complications in resolving lake responses to future reductions in
   loading associated with the zebra mussel invasion are considered.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation examined dieback-declined shoots from Milicia excelsa
   plantations established at Abofour in the dry semi-deciduous forest,
   Amanthia in the moist semi-deciduous forest and Bonsa in the wet
   evergreen forest zones of Ghana. The symptoms developing during
   dieback-decline development were monitored. Opened galls turn
   progressively brown after Phytolyma spp. attack, becoming covered with
   aerial mycelium of varying appearance. Dieback progresses after 60 days
   from the point of gall eruption on the leaves. Another study was carried
   out to determine the fungi associated with the disease. Lasiodiplodia
   theobromae and Fusarium solani were frequently isolated from opened
   galls and dieback twigs at all the three sites while F. solani and F.
   oxysporum occurred on some Phytolyma spp. adults. Soil and air mycoflora
   of the three sites were scanned to trace the sources of the inoculum for
   dieback-decline. Qualitative spectrum of fungal population of these two
   systems did not differ much. There was abundance of L. theabromae in the
   soil samples while in the air Cladosporium herbarum occurred in the two
   seasons at all sites followed by L. theobromae, F. solani and
   Corynespora cassiicola. Isolations from seriously diseased seedling
   material showed the presence of L. theobromae and F solani hyphae in the
   sub-epidermal and cortical parenchyma cells. These results Suggest that
   L, theobromae and F. solani are likely pathogens associated with
   dieback-decline of Milicia excelsa seedlings. The role played by these
   fungi in dieback-decline development is yet to be ascertained.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of climatic adaptation in drosophila and other insects have
   largely been inferred from laboratory comparisons of traits that vary
   clinally. Here, we extend this research to comparisons under seminatural
   conditions. To test for clinal variation in reproductive patterns and
   survival over winter, Drosophila melanogaster populations were initiated
   from seven collection sites along the eastern coast of Australia,
   ranging front tropical to temperate regions. The fecundity and survival
   of these populations were monitored in field cages at a temperate
   location until all adults had died more than 5 months later. Total
   fecundity showed a curvilinear relationship vith latitude, due to higher
   egg production by high- and low-latitude populations. Adults front
   temperate locations survived winter conditions better than those from
   subtropical populations but not tropical ones. There vas a linear cline
   in the timing of egg production: temperate populations produced eggs
   later than populations front lower latitudes. This cline is likely to be
   adaptive because egg-to-adult viability experiments indicated that only
   eggs laid in spring developed successfully to the adult stage. There vas
   no evidence for climatic adaptation in the immature stages. The adult
   mortality rate increased gradually over winter, and in some populations
   vas also correlated with the minimum ambient temperature. These results
   indicate that adaptation to winter conditions in D. melanogaster has
   involved shifts in reproductive patterns.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the foundations of an expert system to map landscape
   features related to salinity, based in a South American case study.
   Salinity distribution is mapped using an approach that integrates
   multi-tem oral classification of remotely sensed data, physical and
   chemical soil properties and landform attributes. Change detection maps
   are derived in a post-classification change detection. These maps
   represent the changes in the distribution of salinity type and its
   severity, and are used as inputs to model the nature, magnitude and
   reliability of salinity-related changes that occurred in the area. Three
   rule-based expert systems using fuzzy sets and fuzzy linguistic rules to
   formalise the expert knowledge about the actual possibility of changes
   to occur are designed and implemented within a geographical information
   system (GIS). The systems use a fuzzy semantic import approach that
   enables the integration of multi-disciplinary knowledge in basic sets of
   fuzzy rules. The outputs of the fuzzy knowledge-based system are three
   maps representing `likelihood of changes', `nature of changes' and
   `magnitude of changes'. These maps are then combined with landscape
   information and analysis of the spatial association among these
   variables, represented in different GIS layers, is undertaken to derive
   an exploratory hazard prediction model. The coefficient of areal
   correspondence is used to assess the degree of association among the
   variables and landscape positions. The sum of the coefficients of areal
   association between the variables considered represents evidence of
   salinity hazard within a specific landscape unit. Higher coefficient
   values indicate higher hazard to salinity processes. Because the
   classification model differentiates among saline and alkaline areas, it
   is possible to evaluate the nature of the salinity changes, i.e. whether
   an area may become more saline, alkaline, or saline-alkaline. This
   information is important for decision-makers and land planners, because
   different reclamation measures can be adopted according to the salinity
   type. The approach provides a fast way of assessing the likely extent of
   salinity at regional level, enabling the integration of a variety of
   data sources and knowledge. Moreover, this monitoring model can help to
   evaluate the effectiveness of salinity control and management action
   plans. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Life history strategy of Chirocephalus ruffoi (Crustacea, Anostraca) in
   Mediterranean temporary mountain pools}},
Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},

Abstract = {{Some temporary pools in the Pollino National Park (1780-1900 m a.s.l)
   are inhabited by Chirocephalus ruffoi Cottarelli \& Mura, 1984, an
   endemic Italian anostracan. These pools predictably fill by snowmelting
   in spring, but the timing and the duration of their flooding is
   unpredictable. Depending on climate, in some years, they also
   erratically fill by unpredictable rainfall in autumn. Field monitoring
   and continuous temperature data recordings were performed, in order to
   define habitat characteristics and related adaptive strategies of the
   resident population.
   The life cycle of C ruffoi begins in late spring after snow melt and is
   strongly affected by temperature regime and pool duration. Significant
   differences (F = 4.62, P < 0.01, df:= 1) in growth rate and maturation
   were found between pools P1 (or P3) and P4, differing in size, position
   and hydrological regime. Growth and maturation were faster in P1 (or P3)
   than in the longer lasting, colder P4. Differences were also recorded
   between years, within a pool, due to climatic conditions; 1998 was
   characterized by higher rainfall, lower temperatures (particularly from
   March on), and consequently the water phase lasted longer than in 1997.
   Hatching occurred as soon as mean water temperature attains 4-5\&DEG;C
   and starts fluctuating. The extent of initial hatching could not be
   assessed in the field, but was low in the laboratory (cumulative
   hatching percentage < 30\% over three hatching cycles) suggesting a risk
   spreading strategy in relation to habitat uncertainty, as in other
   anostracans in unpredictable environments. The same explanation appears
   to apply to the sex ratio, which was constantly and markedly
   female-biased, probably to maximize reproductive output.
   Unlike previously assumed, C. ruffoi is a eurythermic species. The
   adults can survive temperature values of 32degreesC and higher and are
   exposed during their lives to a wide temperature range
   (2-5degreesC/40degreesC) and to diurnal fluctuations as wide as 21
   degrees. Multiple regression analysis showed that temperature was the
   most influential among the environmental variables supposed to affect
   anostracan life cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of landscape preferences using image analysis has been
   pursued for some time. This paper extends a recently developed approach
   to image analysis based on explicit determination of pixel-by-pixel
   depth and content. Another recent experiment monitored path selection
   choices made in a virtual environment. If the depth and content analysis
   approach is to be useful for further development of models of human
   behavior as applied to environmental management, then it needs to be
   able to predict the choices that people make. The potential of the
   approach is tested by dividing the path selection experiment
   participants into three groups on the basis of their choices and
   deriving regression equations which predict the dominant group choices.
   An overall prediction success rate of 85\% appears promising. Further
   investigation is required into mechanisms for incorporating the extra
   information provided by movement in the environment. The importance of
   separating the population into groups is also questioned. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Patent Hematodinium infections of the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus
   can be detected with a morphological method (pleopod diagnosis), but
   this fails to identify low-level haemolymph (sub-patent) and any
   tissue-based (latent) infections. The current study describes the
   development and application of an immunoassay for the detection of
   antigens of the parasite Hematodinium in the Norway lobster N.
   norvegicus. Infected tissue and haemolymph samples were detected as
   multiple-band reactions to a polyclonal antibody (anti-Hematodinium),
   The sensitivity limit of the method was 204 parasites mm(-3),
   approximately 10 times more sensitive than the pleopod diagnosis method.
   Use of the immunoassay on tissue samples taken from catches in the Clyde
   Sea area, Scotland, UK, showed that the pleopod method considerably
   under-diagnosed infection prevalence in the early part of the season,
   though this under-diagnosis decreased as infected lobsters in the field
   progressed from latent and sub-patent to patent infections. However, the
   immunoassay failed to detect any infected lobsters during the summer
   months, suggesting that infection may not be carried over from one
   season to the next. The data presented suggest that this immunoassay
   allows for the accurate estimation of Hematodinium infection prevalence
   in the field and should be employed, where possible, for the routine
   monitoring of infection prevalence in N. norvegicus.}},

Abstract = {{The value of preserving wintergreen fronds into the spring by forest
   understory fern species is unknown. In this study, net photosynthetic
   rates and nitrogen and phosphorus contents were monitored in a
   population of Dryopteris intermedia throughout a spring season to
   explore potential photosynthetic and retranslocational benefits of
   wintergreen fronds. Net photosynthesis occurred throughout the study
   indicating a potential for movement of fixed carbon from wintergreen
   fronds to other parts of the plant. Nitrogen and phosphorus content in
   the old fronds did not change through spring, thus no evidence for net
   retranslocation of these nutrients from wintergreen fronds to the rest
   of the plant was obtained. Maintenance of the wintergreen fronds may
   simply increase retention time and thus nutrient use efficiency of
   limiting nutrients. Other possible benefits of wintergreen fronds exist
   and should be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) has expanded its range
   into the Edwards Plateau of Texas, an area harboring a disjunct relict
   population of paper-shell pinyon pine (Pinus remota). We captured 39
   porcupines and monitored 37 of these animals by radiotelemetry from 1997
   to 1999 to assess their demographic characteristics and determine their
   potential impact in this unique wooded ecosystem. The adult population
   was biased toward females (3 females: 1 male), and annual rates of
   survival were greater (P < 0.01) for adult females (S = 0.91, 95\% CI =
   0.77-1.00) than for adult males (S = 0.42, 95\% CI = 0.00-0.85). Birth
   rates of reproductively mature females averaged 0.82 annually during the
   3-y study. We calculated a mean reproductive rate of 0.41 female
   young/female based on birth rates and juvenile sex ratio. The estimated
   population growth rate of 0.034 indicated that the study population was
   growing. Direct and indirect ecological effects of porcupines in this
   woodland ecosystem warrant investigation.}},

Title = {{Using leaf-mark material to monitor the morphology of white clover
   (Trifolium repens L.) at the clone and ramet level in grazed swards}},

Abstract = {{Leaf markings are widespread in Trifolium spp. White clover (T. repens
   L.) material has been produced at the Institute of Grassland and
   Environmental Research (IGER) Aberystwyth, UK, which demonstrates the
   `filled - V' leaf mark as a subtle but clearly identifiable mark with
   little seasonal variation in expression. This paper describes how a
   population of genotypically identical individual white clover plants
   (clones), created from this material, can be used in grazed swards to
   monitor changes in morphology at the clone and ramet level. In a pilot
   experiment, the effect of a late silage cut on the white clover
   component of grazed mixed swards was investigated. Leaf-mark plants were
   introduced into known positions in a grass/clover sward in 1997 and
   monitored during 1998 under two grazing regimes: (1) continuous grazing
   to a sward surface height of 4 cm (treatment G); and (2) grazing,
   followed by a single late-season silage cut, a brief rest period, and a
   return to autumn sheep grazing (treatment GRG). The GRG treatment had a
   significant and rapid effect, producing larger clones with a larger
   number of ramets and higher proportions of complex ramets than the G
   treatment. As ramet complexity increased the treatment effect
   intensified, resulting in a four-fold increase in clone size, together
   with an enhanced ability to spread into the sward. The GRG treatment
   allowed a more widespread dispersal of individual units and this is
   likely to enhance the opportunity for ramets to encounter favourable
   micro-environments for survival and growth, The benefits and limitations
   of the procedures are discussed. (C) 2001 Annals of Botany Company.}},

Abstract = {{Potential source populations of forest-brooding Neotropical migrant
   birds may be threatened by anthropogenic changes that increase brood
   parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and nest predation
   in heavily forested breeding areas. In southcentral Indiana, corridors
   of agriculture and rural development, ranging from < 50 m to several
   thousand meters in width, penetrate interior portions of the heavily
   forested landscape. These corridors provide habitat for cowbirds and
   nest predators. We monitored breeding success of six species of
   Neotropical migrants and one resident species near an agricultural
   corridor and in interior forest. We found that nest survival was lower
   near the agricultural corridor for most of the species in the nestling
   stage, but no consistent difference in nest survival was detected during
   the egg stage. Levels of cowbird parasitism were generally elevated near
   the agricultural corridor. Estimates of the number of fledglings per
   nesting attempt indicated that seasonal productivity was lower near the
   agricultural corridor for six of the seven species. Status of
   populations of birds in south-central Indiana as sources in the Midwest
   may be compromised by extensive intrusion of agricultural corridors
   within the contiguous, heavily forested landscape.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated site fidelity and apparent survival in a promiscuous
   population of Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed Sparrows (Ammodramus caudacutus) in
   southern Rhode Island. Based on capture-recapture histories of 446
   color-banded sparrows studied from 1993 to 1998 at our primary study
   site, Galilee, we observed significant variation in apparent survival
   rates among years, but not between sexes. Return rates of adult males
   (37.6\%) and females (35.6\%) were not significantly different during
   any year. Juveniles exhibited high return rates, ranging from 0 to 44\%,
   with males (61\% of returns) more likely to return than females (35\%).
   In addition, we monitored movements of 404 color-banded sparrows at nine
   satellite marshes in 1997 and 1998, which supported our findings at
   Galilee and documented intermarsh movements by 10\% of all banded birds.
   Lack of gender-bias in adult dispersal and strong natal philopatry of
   sparrows in Rhode Island occurs regularly among passerines possessing a
   variety of mating systems. Despite emancipation from parental and
   resource defense duties, adult male Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed Sparrows
   exhibited apparent survival rates similar to adult females. Availability
   of high-quality breeding habitat, which is patchy and saturated, may be
   the most important factor limiting dispersal for Saltmarsh Sharp-tailed
   Sparrows in Rhode Island.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the use of non-parametric estimators of species richness to
   evaluate the flora of a relatively large (431 ha) nature reserve, using
   a sampling area much lower than that used in previous studies. Different
   estimation methods were applied to floristic data obtained from 50
   random plots: the number of observed species, the extrapolated
   accumulation curves based on the Michaelis-Menten model and the
   non-parametric estimators based on incidence data (Chao2, first-order
   Jackknife, second-order Jackknife and bootstrap). To test the
   performance of the estimators, five data sets were created on the basis
   of life-forms. The estimates were compared with reference values
   obtained by traditional floristic and vegetation sampling. The power of
   the different estimation methods could not definitively be determined,
   but the first- and second-order Jackknives seem to be the most precise.
   Although total species richness was underestimated, the sample-based
   approach provided accurate information for quantitative comparison of
   time series of data related to ecological changes, vegetation dynamics
   and environmental changes. This sample-based data included basic
   statistics on species richness and species frequency distributions as
   well as the life-form spectrum, at the plot and the whole site scales.

Abstract = {{The magnitude of population fluctuations can affect the power of
   monitoring programs and the calculation of extinction risk. Because
   amphibian populations may be experiencing worldwide declines,
   understanding population fluctuations in amphibians is particularly
   important. I conducted a meta-analysis of population fluctuations in
   amphibian time series. I found that life history type, family and
   latitude were significant predictors of the coefficient of variation in
   population size. Life stage (e.g. tadpoles vs. adults) was a marginally
   significant predictor of the coefficient of variation. Coefficients of
   variation increased with series length in 27 of 29 time series that
   included 8 or more years. However, estimates of the coefficient of
   variation based on subsamples of longer time series often ranged two-to
   10-fold, even with 5 or more years of data used. These results show that
   while some generalizations about amphibian population fluctuations might
   be possible, caution is necessary in selecting monitoring programs or
   calculating extinction risk from estimates of population variability.

Abstract = {{Several series of physical and biological parameters from the California
   Current region were analyzed for coherent long-term (>20 years) trends
   of change. Three different scales of change, related to the availability
   of data and different degrees of precision, were obtained: one for the
   period of most extensive and intensive CalCOFI sampling, roughly
   1951-98; the second for the full century; and the third for the last
   2,000 years.
   Only one regime shift-that of the mid-1970s-was found in the shorter
   series. The shift consists of a long-term trend reversal, including both
   physical and biological data; no sudden step was found. The century-long
   series reveals two other shifts, both consisting of long-term trend
   reversals, the first in the early 1910s and the second during the early
   1940s. Three other less certain shifts seem to have occurred about 1860,
   1880, and 1900. If these indications are true, the similar to60-year
   cycle of sardine abundance may have been much more variable than
   previously believed.
   Sardine abundance appears to be enhanced during warm periods and
   diminished during cool ones; outbursts are very dynamic, lasting only a
   few decades. Regimes should be related to the change itself (either
   warming or cooling), rather than to warm or cool periods. Thus, the main
   factor for change might not be temperature, but possibly large-scale
   ocean current changes and associated alterations in wind systems. We
   found monitoring biological indices to be the most feasible tool for
   nowcasting regime shifts. There is not yet enough information for
   long-term forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{We studied factors causing variation in the initiation of reproduction
   after winter in the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), an iteroparous
   seasonal breeder, by offering different winter food supplements and
   monitoring local density variation. We used either sunflower seeds or
   barley to supplement the diet of populations of bank voles in grassland
   enclosures. In a parallel experiment we used spruce seeds, a natural
   winter food, to supplement the diet of bank vole populations in unfenced
   spruce forest. Survival, maturation, and breeding were monitored by
   livetrapping. Population density decreased during winter in grassland
   enclosures and remained constant in the forest, with no difference
   between food treatments. Breeding was initiated earlier in the grassland
   enclosures than in the forest, probably because of the supplemental food
   supply in both seed treatments and social and environmental stability in
   enclosures. Within both experiments, we found no differences in timing
   of parturition between food treatments. Inter actions of food treatment
   with density of females influenced the time of initiation of breeding in
   both experiments. At low densities, breeding started up to 1 month
   earlier than the population average. At high densities, a proportion of
   females did not breed during spring. Massive food supplements advanced
   the initiation of breeding, but among animals with similar food
   supplies, local population density seemed to have stronger regulatory
   effects. Local density variations may therefore create asynchronous
   breeding patterns within populations under similar wintering conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Induction of phase I biotransformation enzymes is recognized as a
   hallmark response in fish exposed to coplanar PCBs, Depictions of
   vitamins A and E and disrupted thyroid hormone and glandular structure
   secondary to this induction have not yet been examined in an arctic fish
   species. Arctic grayling were exposed to a single oral dose of 0
   (control), 10, 100 or 1000 ng 3,3 ` ,4,4 ` -tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB)
   g(-1) bodyweight, a contaminant found in most arctic fish. After 30 and
   90 days of exposure, TCB concentrations in tissues, hepatic phase I
   activity (as ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD)), plasma and tissue
   vitamin A and E concentrations, plasma thyroid hormone levels and
   thyroid glandular structure were examined. Total plasma osmolality, as
   an indicator of overall fish health was also monitored. TCB recovery in
   tissues was low and extremely variable, making comparisons between
   intended dose groups inappropriate. Therefore. correlation analysis
   between actual recovered TCB concentrations and biochemical responses
   was employed. Hepatic EROD activity correlated strongly with liver TCB
   concentrations. Liver concentrations of vitamin A were altered as a
   function of TCB concentrations and EROD activity, but plasma vitamin A
   status was not affected. Vitamin E was depleted by TCB accumulation in
   blood and EROD induction in liver of males only at 90 days postexposure.
   Thyroid hormones status and glandular structure were not affected by the
   short duration TCB exposures used in this experiment. TCB concentrations
   were correlated with an elevation in plasma osmolality. Results from
   this experiment indicate that the vitamin status and osmoregulation of
   arctic grayling exposed to TCB can be compromised. Further studies of
   field populations exposed to this type of contaminant are warranted.

Abstract = {{Although dramatic amphibian population declines have been reported
   worldwide, our understanding of the extent of the declines in Latin
   America, where amphibian diversity is high, is limited to a few
   well-documented studies. To better understand the geographic extent of
   declines, their possible causes, and the measures needed to improve
   Latin American scientists' ability to research the phenomenon and make
   effective management recommendations, we convened three regional
   workshops with 88 Latin American herpetologists and conservationists.
   Population declines are widespread in Latin America. At least 13
   countries have experienced declines, and in 40 cases species are now
   thought to be extinct or extirpated in a country where they once
   occurred. Declines or extinctions have affected 30 genera and nine
   families of amphibians. Most declines have occurred in remote highlands,
   above 500 m in elevation in Central America and above 1000 m In the
   Andes. Most documented declines occurred in the 1980s. Of the possible
   causes studied to date, climate change appears to be important at one
   site and chytrid fungal disease has been identified at sites in three
   countries. Although many monitoring studies are currently underway in a
   variety of habitats, most studies are recent and of short duration. In a
   signed resolution, workshop participants called for greater
   collaboration and communication among scientists working in Latin
   America to understand the geographic extent of population declines and
   the distribution of possible causal factors. In situ conservation is
   important to protect habitats, but captive-rearing programs for species
   subject to imminent extinction are also needed. Better understanding of
   the taxonomy and natural history of amphibians and more funding for
   research and monitoring are critical to developing a scientific basis
   for management action to arrest and reverse population declines.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious and noninfectious diseases are being recognized by
   conservation biologists as an increasing challenge to the conservation
   of wildlife. Tbe amplified role of diseases as a factor limiting
   species' survival can be traced to anthropogenic changes on a global
   scale that have direct and indirect influences on the health of wildlife
   species. These changes include human population growth, habitat
   fragmentation and degradation, the isolation of populations of species,
   and an increased proximity of humans (and their domestic animals) to
   wildlife. Further, some conservation projects have caused more barm than
   good by unwittingly introducing diseases to wildlife populations,
   whereas others have failed to meet their objectives because they did not
   take disease factors into consideration. Conservation biologists need to
   move quickly past the decades-old debate on the relative importance of
   wildlife health to conservation and begin using all the tools available
   to ensure the effectiveness of their efforts. We briefly review the
   literature on wildlife diseases, place wildlife health in the context of
   global changes affecting wild animal populations, and offer concrete
   suggestions for ways to integrate wildlife health sciences into
   conservation, such as including health assessment or monitoring programs
   and research on interspecies disease transmission in field biology
   projects, training wildlife professionals in the design and
   implementation of wildlife studies that incorporate health components,
   and encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration. Our goal is to raise
   awareness that conservation biologists working in disciplines ranging
   from field biology to policy making have an important role to play in
   facilitating a transition toward a new conservation paradigm that
   includes wildlife health. This paradigm shaft will take an academic
   understanding of the importance of wildlife disease and turn it into
   practical actions that will help conserve wildlife more effectively.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of alien, or nonindigenous, animals and plants has been
   identified by scientists and policy makers as a major threat to
   biodiversity in marine ecosystems. Although government agencies have
   struggled to control alien species on land and freshwater for decades
   with mixed success, the control of alien marine species is in its
   infancy. Prevention of introduction and establishment must be the first
   priority, but many populations of alien marine species are already well
   established worldwide. National and international policies leave
   loopholes for additional invasions to occur and provide only general
   guidance on how to control alien species once they are established. ro
   address this issue, a multinational group of 25 scientists and attorneys
   convened in 1998 to examine options for controlling established
   populations of alien marine species. The discussions resulted in a
   framework for control of alien marine species to provide decision-making
   guidance to policymakers, managers, scientists, and other stakeholders.
   Tbe framework consists of seven basic steps: (1) establish the nature
   and magnitude of the problem, (2) set objectives, (3) consider the full
   range of alternatives, (4) determine risk, (5) reduce risk, (6) assess
   benefits versus risks, and (7) monitor the situation. This framework can
   provide guidance for control efforts under the existing patchwork of
   national laws and can help provide a foundation for international
   cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Returning confiscated animals to their native habitats is desirable when
   it makes a positive contribution to the conservation of the species.
   Release of captive Individuals is complex and controversial, however,
   particularly when risks are potentially high, as In the case of orphaned
   apes. We describe the decision-making process that led to the successive
   release of 20 wild-born orphan chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes)
   into the Conkouati Reserve in the Republic of Congo. Recommendations of
   the Reintroduction Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union's
   Species Survival Commission were followed closely The conservation
   status, ecology, and behavior of wild chimpanzees, the biological,
   social, economic and political context of the release site; and the
   health and genetic status of the candidates for release were all taken
   into account in the planning and execution of the project. Rigorous
   post-release monitoring of behavior and health allowed documentation of
   the outcome. ne project was of benefit to the chimpanzees that were
   released but also brought broad benefits to the site through effective
   protection from poaching and deforestation, and direct and indirect
   benefits to local people. ne genetic and behavioral diversity of
   chimpanzees require a variety of conservation strategies to reduce
   threats and maintain as many viable wild populations as possible.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is being experimentally reintroduced to the forests of southern
   Ohio to determine its effectiveness in restoring and maintaining
   mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest communities. We studied the effects of
   repeated burning (1-4 years of annual burning) and recovery (1 year
   after burning) on the breeding bird community. Burning resulted in
   incremental but temporary reductions in the availability of leaf litter,
   shrubs, and saplings, but it did not affect trees, snags, or understory
   vegetation cover. Of 30 bird species monitored, 4 were affected
   negatively and 2 were affected positively by burning. Population
   densities of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warblers
   (Helmitheros vermivorus), and Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina)
   declined incrementally in response to repeated burning and did not
   recover within 1 year after burning, suggesting a lag time in response
   to the changes in habitat conditions. Densities of Northern Cardinals
   (Cardinalis cardinalis) fluctuated among years in the control units, but
   remained low in the burned units. Densities of American Robins (Turdus
   migratorius) and Eastern Wood-Pewees (Contopus virens) increased in
   response to burning, but these increases were apparent only after
   several years of repeated burning. In general, burning resulted in
   short-term reductions in the suitability of habitat for ground- and
   low-shrub-nesting birds, but it improved habitat for ground- and
   aerial-foraging birds. Overall, there were no changes in the composition
   of the breeding-bird community. Total breeding bird population levels
   were also unaffected by burning. Our results suggest that prescribed
   burning applied on a long-term basis or across large spatial scales is
   likely to have adverse effects on ground- and low-shrub-nesting bird
   species, but other changes in the composition of the breeding-bird
   community are likely to be minimal as long as the closed-canopy forest
   structure is maintained within the context of prescribed burning.}},

Abstract = {{This review summarizes the scattered literature on the effects of
   toxicants on the external and internal innate immunity of fish.
   Insecticides, heavy metals and surfactants have been the most frequently
   examined toxicants, whereas dioxins, furans and polychlorinated
   biphenyls have been tested less frequently. Studies to date have been
   conducted at the levels of cells in vitro, of fish in the laboratory and
   microcosms, and also of fish in the field. Among innate immune
   parameters, phagocyte respiratory burst appears especially sensitive to
   toxicants. Toxicant-induced alterations in external mucous production
   have also been observed repeatedly. Field studies have occasionally
   examined changes to melano-macrophage centers, but the meaning of such
   changes is not clear. Advances in basic knowledge of fish innate
   immunity should lead to improvements in monitoring fish health and
   predicting the impact of toxicants on fish populations, which is a
   fundamental ecotoxicological goal. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We have monitored population fluctuations of microtine rodents since
   1977 in two habitat complexes in Finnmark, northernmost Norway - a low
   arctic plains landscape, with patches of willow scrubland embedded in
   lichen-dwarf birch tundra, and in adjacent highlands, occupied by
   scrub-free heaths, snow-beds and bogs. In the plains landscape, voles
   were cyclic, with a period of five years, and with wave-Eke density
   fluctuations. This pattern is consistent with time trajectory of prey in
   a predator-prey Emit cycle. Autoregression analysis implies that the
   prey pattern is cleanest in the most productive plains habitats, while
   dynamics in the prevailing heath and bog habitats are governed by two
   significant lags, implying that even vole-plant interactions count. In
   the highlands, lemmings had two outbreaks, characterized by J-shaped
   growth curves, and separated by long periods of low density. The
   fluctuation pattern of lemmings in highlands was consistent with the
   predicted time trajectory of a predator. The implications of time
   trajectories are corroborated by direct evidence on microtine impacts
   upon the vegetation and on spatial patterns in predator activity. Even
   the strong dispersal tendency of lemmings during population peaks is
   consistent with the conjecture that they are adapted to play the role of
   a predator in a sustained predator-prey cycle. As a whole, the pattern

Abstract = {{Ecological and environmental variability in natural ecosystems precludes
   the widespread use of simplistic design and analysis tools to detect the
   effects of human activities on natural ecosystems. BACI (Before-After
   and Control-Impact) sampling and analysis is often recommended to
   overcome the problem of inferring that changes are due to an impact
   rather than natural variability. Using five different BACI design and
   analysis techniques (from nested ANOVA to time-series intervention) on
   data with spatial, temporal, and sampling variability at scales relevant
   to impact assessments, we investigated how BACI designs cope with
   interactions between spatial and temporal variability and whether
   natural variability is best treated as random. A number of simulated
   impacts of different sizes and types were imposed on long-term
   observations of six macrofaunal species and three diversity indices. A
   major problem in detecting the impacts was the differences in
   variability between sites. although the statistical detection of impacts
   was aided by treating temporal variability as an underlying process with
   structure, rather than random noise. However, the sensitivity of any
   method depended on the spatial and temporal variability exhibited by the
   ecological measure. Our results emphasize that scale is one of the most
   important concepts in impact assessment. As spatial or temporal scale
   increases, both the number of processes and their importance in
   influencing local populations and communities will change. increasing
   the variability encompassed by the study. We suggest monitoring a number
   of variables (populations) and developing sampling strategies that
   enable a number of methods of analysis to be employed.}},

Abstract = {{1. The migrant Vanessa atalanta (L.) occurs throughout Europe and North
   Africa. In autumn, populations emigrate from northern and central Europe
   to the Mediterranean region to overwinter. In the spring, the northern
   range is recolonised by migrants from the south. The dynamics of the
   species in the winter range is poorly known.
   2. From 1994 to 1999, adults and immatures of V. atalanta were monitored
   all year round in Mediterranean habitats in north-east Spain.
   3. Data showed that the Catalonia lowlands is an area to which V.
   atalanta migrates to breed during the winter. Migrants arrive in October
   and early November and initiate a period of intensive breeding. Larval
   development occurs throughout the winter until a first annual generation
   of adults appears in early spring.
   4. Most of the butterflies emerging in the spring emigrate and leave the
   area without breeding. The data suggest strongly that recolonisation of
   the northern range is by these butterflies not by wintering adults.
   Altitudinal migration also seems to be a common phenomenon, allowing a
   further summer generation of adults to occur at high elevations within
   the Mediterranean region.
   5. The complex phenology of V. atalanta in its southern range has
   evolved as a strategy to track larval resources through space and time.
   Autumn migration coincides with the greatest availability of the main
   food plant, Urtica dioica L. Late spring migration occurs by the time
   food quality is decreasing.}},

Abstract = {{Although environmental parental effects, especially maternal effects,
   are well known in plants we have almost no information about their
   expression in nature. This study explores the influence of maternal and
   paternal light and nutrient environments on germination characters under
   natural conditions in the herbaceous plant Campanula americana. Families
   were grown in a greenhouse under three levels of light or three levels
   of nutrients, and crosses were conducted within each environmental
   gradient to produce seeds with all combinations of maternal and paternal
   environments. Seeds produced under the controlled environments were
   planted into the home site of the population and another local site, and
   germination was monitored over the fall and spring germinating seasons.
   The paternal light environment influenced percentage germination,
   demonstrating that the offspring phenotype may depend on the environment
   a set of pollen donors is grown in. The effect of maternal nutrient
   level on percentage germination depended on the offspring environment.
   Percentage germination in response to maternal nutrient and paternal
   light environments varied among families, suggesting that these parental
   environmental effects are genetically variable. Both maternal light and
   nutrient environments influenced season of germination. Germination
   season determines life history in C americana: fall-germinating
   individuals are annuals while spring-germinating seeds are biennials.
   Maternal plants grown under low and high light and low nutrient
   conditions produced more biennial offspring while the remaining maternal
   environments had an equal frequency of annual and biennial offspring. In
   C americana maternal environments influence life history and therefore
   fitness through their effects on season of germination.}},

Abstract = {{Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni, the Alabama cavefish, is a federally
   endangered stygobitic fish that is restricted to Key Cave in
   northwestern Alabama. Due to the low abundance of this species and the
   continuous threats to the cave's recharge area, we surveyed Key Cave
   from 1992 to 1997. Alabama cavefish were present in five different pools
   and had numbers comparable to previous surveys performed in the 1970's
   and 1980's. Three different size classes were observed, indicating
   recruitment is occurring. These data suggest that the population is
   relatively stable, but future monitoring is recommended. The Alabama
   cavefish is an endangered species and is extremely difficult to capture,
   therefore any marking program to accurately estimate the population size
   is unlikely. A single specimen of Typhlichthys subterraneus was captured
   in Key Cave. This falsifies the previous assumption that these two
   species are allopatric. Because of this discovery, we resurveyed seven
   caves in the area around Key Cave for additional populations of S.
   poulsoni. These caves had either known populations of T. subterraneus or
   unidentified cavefish. No additional populations of S. poulsoni were
   discovered, but further investigation is warranted. The Key Cave
   National Wildlife Refuge was established in the high recharge area of
   Key Cave to protect this habitat, yet threats to the groundwater
   continue from encroaching urbanization.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of western blackheaded budworm, Acleris gloverana
   (Walsingham), have fluctuated widely over the length of Vancouver Island
   with five outbreaks having occurred since 1941. The core of the severe
   defoliation occurred in the southern and northern portions of a central
   mountain chain running the length of the Island. Four monitoring sites
   were established in the central core area and five in peripheral sites
   during the 1970-1973 outbreak. At each site, samples were taken during
   five different life stages per generation, beginning at the peak of
   defoliation and ending when larval densities declined below detectable
   levels. The largest losses during the population collapse occurred
   during the larval period when large numbers abandoned the damaged trees
   by spinning off on silk threads. In addition, when age-specific survival
   ratios for each developmental stage were compared with the generation
   survival ratio, the closest relationship occurred between generation
   survival and the adult dispersal and oviposition period. Large
   emigration away from the central core area of defoliation to peripheral
   stands was detected, particularly during the first year of collapse. We
   suggest that, in response to damaged foliage, larvae and adults disperse
   from the stands and the outbreak collapses before the trees are killed.
   The dispersal response of defoliating populations appears to dampen the
   upward population trend. The trees survive, refoliate, and thus preserve
   the habitat for potential population increases during the next outbreak
   period. Host interrelationships during population gradations of the
   blackheaded budworm are compared with other conifer defoliators of
   British Columbia, particularly the western spruce budworm and the
   Douglas-fir tussock moth.}},

Abstract = {{Taylor's power law (s(2) = a (x) over bar (b)) was fitted to the means
   and variances of numbers of adult Diaprepes abbreviatus L. and
   Pachnaeus, litus (Germar) caught monthly in modified Tedders traps
   (citrus Tedders traps). Data for D. abbreviatus were obtained in six
   Florida citrus groves, two located on the central ridge and the others
   in the central and southern flatwoods. Parameters for P. litus (a =
   2.15, b = 1.17) using data pooled from two sites were consistent with
   parameters derived from the individual sites. Parameters derived from
   pooled data for D, abbreviatus were a = 2.69, b = 1.33; however, there
   was significant variability of the parameter b among sites. For
   specified levels of precision (confidence interval half-length:mean
   ratio), from 0-30\% fewer traps were needed to estimate numbers of F.
   litus compared with D. abbreviatus at densities encountered in these
   groves. Plot size from 0.06 to > 12 ha affected the numbers of traps
   needed to obtain monthly mean estimates of adult weevils per trap with a
   given level of precision. In general, sample precision was equal in
   large and small plots when population density in large plots was double
   that in small plots. At a given population density, approximate to 70\%
   more traps were required in large compared with small plots to achieve a
   similar level of precision. Changes in trapped weevil abundance larger
   than 2.5-fold were detected as significantly different with the sampling
   plans used in these studies. Seasonality in the numbers of each species
   was evident at all sites (P = 0.05) because monthly means varied by 30-
   to 60-fold. In a separate study, the numbers of weevils recovered
   monthly from citrus Tedders traps were approximately congruent (r =
   0.78, n = 33, P = 0.01) with numbers recovered from-cone-shaped ground
   traps that only recover adult weevils as they emerge from soil. Annual
   maxima-for both types of traps occurred at the same times during 33 mo,
   but each year weevil emergence from soil (as measured by cone traps)
   remained high for 1-2 mo after weevil recovery from citrus Tedders traps
   declined. Polynomial regression on monthly recovery from citrus Tedders
   traps explained 66\% of the variation in monthly emergence of weevils
   from soil. Results of this study support the use of citrus Tedders traps
   in integrated pest management programs to detect the onset of emergence
   from soil by weevil cohorts, and to measure relative differences in
   weevil population density due to experimental treatments.}},

Abstract = {{In mid-1996, we detected an unintentionally introduced seed-head fly,
   Chartorellia succinea (Costa), destroying seeds of yellow starthistle,
   Centaurea solstitialis L., one of the worst weeds in the western United
   States. In overseas studies, Chaetorellia succinea had been considered
   as a potential biological control agent for yellow starthistle, but had
   been rejected because of fears that it might become a pest of safflower,
   Carthamus tinctorius L., in the United States. From mid-1996 through
   early 2000, we conducted both laboratory and field evaluations to
   determine whether this fly could cause significant damage to safflower,
   a widely planted crop in California. In laboratory no-choice host range
   evaluations, adult females would oviposit, and the larvae completed
   development, on all five varieties of safflower that we tested. However,
   in choice tests, only one head each of two varieties of safflower was
   attacked. No safflower was attacked at three sites in California and
   Oregon, with large populations of Chaetorellia succinea, where we grew
   five varieties of safflower as `trap plants.' Our monitoring of possible
   Chaetorellia succinea attack on safflower growing in 47 fields in
   California detected a small, but persistent population of this fly
   infesting an uncommon safflower variety at one field. We feel that our
   results indicate a minimal risk to commercial safflower growers, and
   this fly continues to show promise in assisting toward the eventual
   biological control of yellow starthistle.}},

Abstract = {{In response to potential threats to human health and fish populations,
   six states along the east coast of the United States initiated
   monitoring programs related to Pfiesteria-like organisms in 1998, These
   actions were taken in the wake of toxic outbreaks of Pfiesteria
   piscicida Steidinger \& Burkholder in Maryland during 1997 and previous
   outbreaks in North Carolina. The monitoring programs have two major
   purposes. The first, rapid response, is to ensure public safety by
   responding immediately to conditions that may indicate the presence of
   Pfiesteria or related organisms in a toxic state. The second,
   comprehensive assessment, is to provide a more complete understanding of
   where Pfiesteria-like organisms may become a threat, to understand what
   factors may stimulate their growth and toxicity, and to evaluate the
   impacts of these organisms upon fish and other aquatic life. In states
   where human health studies are being conducted, the data from both types
   of monitoring are used to provide information on environmental exposure.
   The three elements included in each monitoring program are
   identification of Pfiesteria-like organisms, water quality measurements,
   and assessments of fish health. Identification of Pfiesteria-like
   organisms is a particularly difficult element of the monitoring
   programs, as these small species cannot be definitively identified using
   light microscopy; newly applied molecular techniques, however, are
   starting to provide alternatives to traditional methods. State
   monitoring programs also offer many opportunities for collaborations
   with research initiatives targeting both environmental and human health
   issues related to Pfiesteria-like organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that the estuarine dinoflagellates, Pfiesteria
   piscicida Steidinger \& Burkholder and P. shumwayae Glasgow \&
   Burkholder, members of the toxic Pfiesteria complex (TPC), may release
   one or more toxins that kill fish and adversely affect human health, In
   the current study we Investigated the potential for undiagnosed cases ol
   possible estuary-associated syndrome (PEAS), as termed by the Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in a population that had
   residential and/or recreational exposure to TPC-affected estuaries, but
   that did not have direct contact with fish kills or lesioned fish.
   Age-adjusted visual contrast sensitivity (VCS) was significantly lower
   and the presence of PEAS-associated symptoms was Much higher in the
   estuary cohort (n = 77) than in combined-control cohorts (n = 87), one
   without exposure to bodies of water (n = 53) and one with exposure to
   marine waters (n = 34). In the estuary cohort, 37 individuals met the
   CDC case definition for PEAS and had significantly lower VCS than
   non-PEAS cases. The VCS improved and symptoms abated after 2 weeks of
   treatment with cholestyramine. Cholestyramine, the original drug
   approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, has previously been
   reported to enhance the elimination rates of a variety of toxins,
   presumably by interruption of enterohepatic recirculation through toxin
   entrapment in its polymeric structure and/or anion-exchange process.
   Control studies showed that repeated VCS testing alone did not improve
   VCS scores and that cholestyramine treatment did not affect VCS in
   patients with elevated cholesterol levels. These results suggested that
   a) susceptible individuals may acquire PEAS through residential and/or
   recreational contact with TPC-affected estuaries in the absence of an
   active fish kill; b) VCS is a useful indicator in PEAS diagnosis and
   treatment monitoring; and c) PEAS can be effectively treated with
   cholestyramine. Because the study did not use population sampling
   techniques, the results do not indicate PEAS prevalence. Furthermore,
   definitive diagnosis of PEAS and association with TPC toxin(s) must
   await identification of, and a serologic test for, the putative TPC
   toxin(s). Key words: cholestyramine, chronic neurotoxic illness, harmful
   algal blooms, Pfiesteria, possible estuary-associated syndrome, visual

Abstract = {{Presently in Australia there are no mandatory drinking water standards.
   Here we argue that the risk associated with drinking water in Australia
   is of a dimension discernible to warrant mandatory regulations. The
   catchments that supply the major metropolitan areas of Sydney and
   Adelaide, and the groundwater for the city of Perth have been seriously
   compromised by the encroachment of development and activities. Melbourne
   in the past has generally relied on a closed catchment reservoir system;
   however, population growth in the near future will sequester the full
   online operation of additional reservoirs, which have multiple land use
   catchments. In addition to the current landscape circumstances, the
   management of a water system in itself proposes significant issues of
   risk. Two critical assumptions that are unique to a mass medium
   substance like water and dramatically alter the appraisal of risk are:
   (1) very large numbers of people are potentially exposed, and (2) small
   changes in contaminant levels may have adverse population outcomes. It
   is also known that water reticulation systems frequently suffer from
   contamination problems caused solely by the distribution system, and
   optimal management of these facilities would best be served by statutory
   protected transparency and dedicated water quality programs. In 1979, an
   Australian parliamentary committee stated that an ``uncontaminated water
   supply is{''} a ``basic requirement for the obtainment of good
   health{''}; however, recent surveys of Australian water systems show
   many are not meeting basic water quality criteria, and many communities
   are, not receiving regular monitoring or testing as required by
   government authorized Australian drinking water guidelines, Exacerbating
   this situation is the lack of reporting and statutory endorsed
   standardized procedures to ensure information is properly and promptly
   recorded and that data are centralized for maximum benefit. The
   evaluation of risk associated with drinking water in Australia is
   often-hampered by inadequate or incomplete data. Lastly, regional and
   rural water supplies face a vast array of contemporary problems and
   experiences that include widespread usage of pesticides and agricultural
   chemicals. In recent years, the Darling River has experienced the worst
   algal bloom known to man, and this river system not only supplies a
   number of regional and rural towns with water, but eventually connects
   with the River Murray, which supplies the State of South Australia with
   approximately 50\% of its water requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity generation from coal has increased by an average of 51
   billion kWh per year over the past 3 years. For this reason
   cost-effective strategies to control nitrogen oxides (NO)from coal-fired
   power plant combustion gases must be developed. Compost biofilters
   operated at 55 degreesC at an empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 13
   seconds were shown to be feasible for removal of nitric oxide (NO) from
   synthetic flue gas. Denitrifying microbial populations in these
   biofilters were shown to reduce influent NO feeds by 90 to 95\% at inlet
   NO concentrations of 500ppmv. Oxygen was shown to have a significant
   effect on the NO removal efficiency demonstrated ki, these biofilters.
   Two biofilters were set up under identical conditions for the purpose of
   monitoring NO removal as well as changes in the microbial population in
   the bed medium under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, Changes in the
   microbial population were monitored to determine the maximum oxygen
   tolerance of a denitrifying biofilter as well as methods of optimizing
   microbial populations capable of denitrification in the presence of low
   oxygen concentrations. Nitric oxide removal dropped to between 10 and
   20\% when oxygen tvas present in the influent stream. The inactive
   compost used to pack the biofilters may have also caused the decreased
   NO removal efficiency compared to previous biofiltration experiments.
   Analysis of the bed medium microbial population using environmental
   scanning electron microscopy indicated significant increases in biomass
   populating the surface of the compost when compared to unacclimated
   Compost.}},

Abstract = {{To protect the bioceonosis within activated sludge, a method of
   predicting the toxic effect of influents to the biological treatment
   stage of waste water treatment plants, based on DIN method 38412 L 34,
   has been developed. A population of the luminescent marine bacterium
   Vibrio fischeri was incorporated into a sludge testing matrix derived
   from a model laboratory and real activated sludge plants. The sludge was
   challenged with different concentrations of pure toxicants and complex
   aqueous samples, and light output by V fischeri monitored. The results
   were compared to toxicant testing in the absence of sludge (standard
   test). The modified method was found to be less sensitive for some
   toxicants tested than the standard DIN and other bioluminescent tests,
   but considered more realistic as it provides buffering and takes into
   account sorption which can affect the sensitivity of the test towards
   some compounds. The method is comparable in terms of ease of use, speed,
   reproducibility and cost effectiveness to standard V fischeri
   luminescence methods. (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic transmitters were surgically implanted into adult tautog
   (n=27,400-514 mm TL) to document seasonal occurrence and site
   utilization at four sites situated within known tautog habitat near Cape
   Charles, Virginia, in lower Chesapeake Bay. Tagged tautog were released
   at the same sites where originally caught within 2 h of capture. Sites
   were continuously monitored with automated acoustic receivers between 9
   November 1998 and 13 October 1999. Two sites consisted of natural
   bedform. materials and two sites consisted of manmade materials.
   Ninety-four percent of tautog (n=15) released in fall 1998 remained
   inshore during winter at sustained water temperatures of 5-8 degreesC,
   rather than moved offshore during winter as documented for tautog off
   New York, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Ninety-one percent (n=10) of
   tautog released in spring 1999 remained inshore during summer when water
   temperature was 27 degreesC and in the absence of an important food
   item, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). These findings conflict with
   assertions that tautog move to cooler water in summer when water
   temperatures reach 20 degreesC. Tautog released at natural bedform.
   sites were detected only at these sites throughout the study. Tautog
   released at manmade structures also displayed high site-utilization
   patterns, but several tautog periodically moved 2-10.2 km away from
   these sites over featureless bottom, a known deterrent to emigration for
   large temperate labrids in other waters. Benthic communities were
   similar at manmade sites and natural bedform sites, and movement away
   from manmade sites may have been influenced by habitat size as well as
   habitat structure. Understanding temporal and spatial utilization of
   habitats is an important first step to identifying essential fish
   habitat and to evaluating and protecting fishery resources within
   Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere.}},

Title = {{Passage through bird guts causes interspecific differences in seed
   germination characteristics}},

Abstract = {{1. Seed germination characteristics are often modified after seeds are
   ingested by frugivores. Factors that are intrinsic either to the plant
   or to the frugivore's digestive tract are responsible for the great
   variation observed in germination response.
   2. Our objectives were to determine whether and how the seed germination
   patterns of five common western Mediterranean plant species are affected
   by seed passage through the guts of their major dispersers, and to
   elucidate the mechanism by which such patterns are changed.
   3. We used captive birds (Turdus merula and Sylvia melanocephala) to
   obtain ingested seeds and compared their germination rate (speed) and
   germinability (final percent germination) with those of controls
   (uningested, pulp-removed seeds), controlling for seed age, size and
   source. Germination was monitored for 2 years in an experimental garden.
   We evaluated the possible changes in seed traits after ingestion by
   measuring weight and coat thickness, and by observing seed coat
   sculpture.
   4. Rate of seed germination, but not germinability, changed in all
   species after gut treatment. The greatest effect was in Osyris, in which
   germination was much enhanced. A great acceleration of germination,
   which is likely to translate into a seedling size advantage, was also
   found in Asparagus. In the other three species tested, germination was
   slower for ingested than for control seeds.
   5. For Rubus and Rubia seeds, we found a different germination response
   depending upon the frugivore species tested. A different degree of seed
   coat scarification caused by differences in gut retention time, chemical
   and/or mechanical abrasion probably account for such responses.
   6. In three of the species (Osyris, Rubia and Phillyrea), seed weight
   decreased after gut treatment. Such weight loss was not caused by any
   change in coat thickness, but may have been because of the scarification
   and consequent alteration of the seed coat structure.
   7. The five Mediterranean species studied germinate when rains are most
   likely to fall (mostly autumn and spring). The different speed of
   germination promoted by gut treatment within frugivores may increase the
   probability that seeds can recruit successfully at a given time and in a
   given place.
   8. This study suggests that frugivores contribute to the heterogeneity
   in germination characteristics not only within plant populations but
   also within plant communities, each frugivore species having a
   particular effect on the seeds of each plant consumed.}},

Abstract = {{We have thus far constructed a series of coupled ecological/physical
   models to predict the origin and fate of harmful algal blooms of the
   toxic dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium breve, on the West Florida shelf We
   find that (1) the maximal population growth rate of G. breve must be
   similar to0.80 day(-1) during initiation of a red tide, but as little as
   0.08 day(-1) during its decay, (2) diatoms dominate when estuarine and
   shelf-break supplies of nitrate are made available to a model community
   of small and large diatoms, coccoid cyanophytes and Trichodesmium,
   non-toxic and red-tide dinoflagellates, microflagellates, and
   coccolithophores, (3) a numerical recipe for large red tides of G. breve
   requires DON supplies, mediated by iron-starved, nitrogen-fixers, while
   small blooms may persist on sediment sources of DON, (4) selective
   grazing must be exerted on the non-toxic dinoflagellates, and (5)
   vertical migration of G. breve in relation to seasonal changes of summer
   downwelling and fall/winter upwelling flow fields determines the
   duration and intensity of red tide landfalls along the barrier islands
   and beaches of the west coast of Florida, once other losses are
   specified.
   Given poorly known initial and boundary conditions and the expense of
   shipboard monitoring programs, however, bio-optical moorings or remote
   sensors are the most likely sources of model validation and improved HAB
   forecasts. Accordingly, the bio-optical implications of our ecological
   models must be included in future simulation analyses of HABs on both
   the West Florida shelf and within other coastal regions. Of particular
   importance for initiation of the coupled biophysical models is an
   improved understanding of the relationship of remotely sensed surface
   signals to shade-adapted dinoflagellates, aggregating below the first
   optical depth of the water column.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of recruitment to Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) and red sea
   urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) populations have focused on
   recruitment variability on interannual, 1000-km scales. These studies
   have identified correlations between recruitment and variables
   indicating ENSO conditions and wind-forced larval transport. On longer
   scales. our understanding of biologically important physical variability
   in the California Current has recently been enhanced by an appreciation
   of semi-basin, decadal changes. Intensification of the Aleutian
   low-pressure zone in the mid-1970s had a clear positive effect of
   biological productivity in the Gulf of Alaska, and less obvious negative
   effects on productivity in the California Current. On shorter scales,
   art increasing appreciation of the effect of dispersal patterns on
   population dynamics and the potential of spatially explicit management
   schemes provide the impetus for studying processes such as alongshore
   spatial variability in recruitment and the underlying daily variability
   in circulation over 100-km distances. In the 1980s, physical studies of
   coastal circulation in response to daily fluctuations in upwelling winds
   identified brief periods of northward, onshore How interrupting the
   offshore, southward flows associated with active upwelling. In the
   1990s, concurrent monitoring of biological and physical conditions
   revealed that these flows transport late-stage invertebrate larvae from
   a retention zone in the lee of a local promontory to settlement
   locations, producing specific spatial patterns of recruitment.
   Variability in recruitment of both crabs and Sea urchins is thus driven
   by daily temporal variability in upwelling winds and 100-km spatial
   variability in coastal topography. Interannual recruitment variability
   appears to depend on ENSO-related biological productivity and larval
   transport in ways that vary among species. but are not completely
   understood. Observations are consistent with coastwide, interannual
   variability being driven by biological productivity (i.e. ENSO/non-ENSO
   conditions), while the upwelling relaxation mechanism sets the spatial
   scale, and decadal, semi-basin variability modulates the frequency of
   ENSO conditions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent changes in land use have resulted in dramatic habitat loss for
   numerous species, More than 99\% of the habitat for Fender's blue
   butterfly Icaricia icarioides fenderi, an endangered butterfly in
   Oregon, USA, has been lost.
   2. Fender's blue butterflies require larval host-plants (Kincaid's
   lupine Lupinus sulphureus kincaidii) and nectar from native wildflowers.
   3. An experiment was conducted at two degraded sites near Eugene,
   Oregon, to investigate methods for restoration of Fender's blue habitat.
   The experimental design included four soil treatments (tilling, reverse
   fertilization, solarization and a control) combined with two planting
   treatments (50\% forb seed: 50\% grass seed and 10\% forb seed : 90\%
   grass seed) and two weeding treatments (weeding or not weeding).
   Treatments were replicated in eight experimental blocks (9 x 28 m) at
   each site. Seeds from 12 native plant species were field collected and
   sown in September 1995.
   4. Plant establishment was monitored in May 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999.
   In 1999, flowers of all nectar species and leaves of Kincaid's lupine
   were counted.
   5. Based on estimates of resource needs from previous work, resources
   were evaluated as insufficient, sufficient or ample.
   6. Solarization combined with 50\% forb : 50\% grass planting promoted
   sufficient nectar to sustain butterflies at both sites. Control
   treatments provided insufficient nectar at both sites. None of the
   treatments produced sufficient larval resources.
   7. This experiment demonstrates a method to quantitatively link habitat
   restoration to the resource needs of focal species. The results
   emphasize the importance of connecting restoration efforts to the
   life-history features of focal species. In addition, they highlight the
   importance of using experiments conducted across a range of sites to
   test restoration methods before large-scale efforts are implemented.}},

Abstract = {{Drought is the single most important environmental factor that causes
   cattle population fluctuations in northern Kenya. The way the grazing
   lands and animal populations are affected by drought requires long-term
   monitoring. However, in northern Kenya, patterns of cattle mortality
   following multiple drought episodes and recovery have not been compared
   before. This study compared effects of two droughts (1983/1984 and
   1991/1992) and three recovery periods (1984, 1992 and 1996) on cattle
   population in Obbu, northern Kenya. Cattle mortality in terms of age-sex
   classes; calves, immature animals, breeding females and mature males
   were compared to understand drought impacts, while relative growth rates
   of herds and percentage of recovery to pre-drought cattle population
   levels were determined to understand recovery. The droughts altered herd
   structure and resulted in greater mortality among calves and breeding
   females (especially during 1983/1984) than immature animals and mature
   male cattle. Drought stress in terms of cattle mortality varied from
   area to another but at the regional level it was less during the
   1983/1984 drought (69.8 +/- 2-0\%) than 1991/1992 (86-8 +/- 1.9\%). The
   pre-1983/1984 drought herd size for the Obbu region explained 12.4\% of
   the variation of the post-drought cattle population, while the
   pre-1991/1992 drought population explained < 1\% of the variation.
   Although cattle mortality was weakly linked to the pre-drought
   population, it was influenced by factors such as disease epidemics and
   poor nutritional quality in forage. Relative growth rates of herds in
   Obbu averaged 3.5\% year(-1) after the 1983/1984 drought leading to full
   recovery in 7 years, while, after the 1991/1992 drought, mean relative
   growth rate was 2.8\% year(-1), which after 5 years only achieved
   ca.32\% recovery of the pre-1991/1992 drought cattle population. (C)

Title = {{Canopy and substratum heterogeneity influence recruitment of the
   mangrove Avicennia marina}},

Abstract = {{1 Mangrove forests are structurally complex with canopy gaps generated
   by physical disturbances such as storms and mounds created on the forest
   floor by biotic disturbances such as crabs excavating burrows.
   2 I studied how variations in canopy cover and substratum topography
   influence the recruitment and demography of the mangrove Avicennia
   marina in a temperate forest in New South Wales, Australia.
   3 Surveys showed that mounds covered up to 44\% of the forest floor and
   were larger and covered more of the substratum under the canopy than in
   gaps. Propagules and new seedlings (i.e. the most recently established
   cohort) were more abundant under the canopy than in gaps and on flat
   areas than on mounds.
   4 A field experiment tested whether the observed spatial distribution of
   new seedlings was due to differences in the secondary dispersal of
   propagules or in the establishment or early survivorship of seedlings.
   Propagules were supplied in equal densities on mounds and flats under
   the canopy and in gaps and then monitored for 10 months.
   5 Four times as many propagules were dispersed away from mounds as from
   flats, and this difference was greater under the canopy than in gaps. In
   contrast, seedlings established more successfully on mounds,
   particularly in gaps, suggesting that this is an important microhabitat
   for recruitment. Seedling survival to 9 months was independent of
   habitat structure.
   6 The influence of mounds on dispersal was, however, much greater than
   on establishment, so that densities of new seedlings 9 months after
   establishment were greater on flats. Patterns of seedling abundance in
   the mangrove forest are thus primarily driven by the influence of
   habitat structure on the supply of propagules.
   7 In contrast, saplings were most abundant on mounds in gaps. Thus,
   there is a shift in the spatial distribution of the population from the
   early to the later stages of life history in relation to habitat
   structure. Long-term survival of seedlings and their development into
   saplings may depend both on light availability in gaps and on sediment
   disturbance resulting from the creation of mounds. The causative agent,
   crabs, may therefore be critical for regeneration of mangrove forests.}},
