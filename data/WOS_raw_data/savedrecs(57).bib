Abstract = {{Despite its practical application in conservation biology and
   evolutionary theory, the cost of inbreeding in natural populations of
   plants and animals remains to a large degree unknown. In this review we
   have gathered estimates of inbreeding depression (delta) from the
   literature for wild species monitored in the held. We have also
   corrected estimates of delta by dividing by F (coefficient of;
   inbreeding), to take into account the influence that the variation in F
   will have on delta. Our data set includes seven bird species, nine
   mammal species, four species of poikilotherms (snakes, fish and snails)
   and 15 plant species. In total we obtained 169 estimates of inbreeding
   depression for 137 traits; 81 of those estimates included estimates of
   F. We compared our mammalian data (limited to those traits related to
   juvenile mortality) to the estimates for captive zoo species published
   by Rails et al. (1988) to determine if, as predicted from the
   literature, natural estimates of inbreeding depression are higher than
   captive estimates. The mean delta +/- SE (significantly different from
   zero and not corrected for F) for homeotherms was 0.509 +/- 0.081; for
   poikilotherms, 0.201 +/- 0.039; and for plants, 0.331 +/- 0.038. Levels
   of inbreeding depression this high in magnitude will be biologically
   important under natural conditions. When we limited our data set to
   mortality traits for mammals and corrected for F = 0.25 las is the case
   for the Rails et al. data set), we found a significant difference
   between the two data sets; wild estimates had a substantially higher
   mean cost of inbreeding at F = 0.25: 2.155 (captive species: 0.314). Of
   the 169 estimates of delta, 90 were significantly different from zero,
   indicating that inbred wild species measured under natural conditions
   frequently exhibit moderate to high levels of inbreeding depression in
   fitness traits.}},

Abstract = {{The Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) has been exploited
   commercially in the upper estuary of the St. Lawrence River right up
   until the present day. Statistics on annual landings from 20 to 40 t
   between 1940 and 1966, and an almost total absence between 1967 and
   1975, were followed by a significant capture increase, which reached 120
   t in 1993.
   Analysis of captures has shown that the median age of sturgeon caught
   has gone down from 11 to 6 years-old in recent years, that the length of
   the fish (LF) varied between 50 cm and 170 cm, and that the last
   significant cohorts supporting the fishery come from 1982, 1986 and
   1988. In 1994, 2\% to 4\% of captures were larger than 150 cm. No fish
   in reproductive state, even among the largest individuals, was observed
   among the captures.
   Since 1995, we have adopted various regulations in order to protect the
   largest sturgeons, and to reduce the annual landings to 60 t in 1998.
   Monitoring of captures, conducted in collaboration with commercial
   fishermen, has enabled us to measure the effects of these new fishing
   regulations, which include fishing effort control, reduction of the
   season, size limits for captures, and imposition of a quota. These
   measures have allowed us to partially reach our objective, since
   landings in 1997 were reduced to 66 t.
   The absence of sexually mature adults in captures has always raised the
   question as to their abundance and the areas which they use. Current
   studies are demonstrating that the sexually mature adults use the
   deepest parts of the estuary, sectors which are not exploited in a
   sustained way by fishermen. Studies are in progress to locate spawning
   grounds and early juvenile habitat. Exploitation of this population will
   continue to be closely monitored.}},

Abstract = {{The white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) of the Kootenai River was
   listed as endangered on September 6, 1994 by the United States Fish and
   Wildlife Service. This transboundary population, residing in Kootenay
   Lake and Kootenay River in Canada, and the Kootenai River in the US, has
   been in general decline since the mid-1960's. There has been very little
   recruitment to this population in the last 20 years.
   This population became isolated from other white sturgeon populations of
   the Columbia River basin during the last ice age of approximately 10,000
   years ago. The population adapted to the pre-development conditions of
   the Kootenai system, with a high spring freshet and extensive side
   channel and low-lying delta marshlands. Modification of the Kootenai
   River by human activities, such as industrial developments, floodplain
   dyking, and dam construction has changed the hydrograph of the Kootenai
   River, altering sturgeon spawning, incubation and rearing habitats and
   reducing overall biological productivity.
   A Kootenai River white sturgeon draft recovery plan was prepared by the
   US Fish and Wildlife Service in cooperation with other agencies in the
   US and Canada. The plan was peer reviewed and there was a parallel
   public consultation process, where public commentary was invited from
   both sides of the international border. The short-term recovery
   objectives of the recovery plan are to prevent extinction and
   re-establish successful natural recruitment. The identified long-term
   objectives are the re-establishment of a self sustaining population and
   the restoration of productive habitat, in order to downlist to
   threatened status and subsequently delist this population when recovery
   is well established. Specific actions needed for recovery include spring
   flow augmentation during the reproduction period; a conservation
   aquaculture program to prevent near-term extinction; habitat
   restoration, and research and monitoring programs to evaluate recovery
   progress.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of urbanization on spring water quality was investigated at
   Wadi Kufranja basin, Jordan. Twenty-five springs originate from three
   Upper Cretaceous aquifer systems (Naur, Hummar and Wadi Es-Sir). The
   discharge from the springs represents the main water source for domestic
   water supply in the basin. The water quality of nine representative
   springs in the basin was monitored. Generally, the average electrical
   conductivity (EC) of the springs fluctuated between 547 and 1030 mu S
   cm(-1). The chemical and biological contents of the spring water showed
   cyclic values due to water consumption and recharge during summer and
   winter. There was a slight annual increase in EC of about 5\%. Nitrate
   content, reached around 100 mg l(-1) and faecal coliform bacteria
   occurred at approximately 100 colonies per 100 mi in some springs. The
   highly polluted springs are located in the settlement areas of the
   basin. The cesspools of houses not connected to the sewer system are
   considered to be the main cause of water pollution. Population increase
   (growth rate 3.5\%) will further accelerate the pollution of spring
   water and reduce the supply of potable water. It is suggested that the
   spring water should be chlorinated to immediately eliminate faecal
   coliform bacteria. Water of different springs is blended to obtain a
   nitrate content below the maximum permissible limit (45 mg l(-1)) of
   drinking-water standards of Jordan. Additionally, chemical and
   biological investigations show that the Kufranja Treatment Plant (KTP)
   is overloaded and could pollute the surface water in the basin. The
   average EC increased from 573 to 742 mu S cm(-1) after mixing with KTP
   water. Also, chemical and biological content increased, especially
   during summer, where no fresh water is available to dilute the treated
   waste water. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

   of Nothofagus fusca (Nothofagaceae) in a forest ecotone in south-western
   New Zealand}},

Abstract = {{Aim New Zealand's cool temperate forests are usually dominated by one or
   more of the five native taxa of Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae; southern
   beech), but in certain regions there are sharp boundaries against
   podocarp-broadleaved forest where Nothofagus is rare or completely
   absent, either for historical (Pleistocene Glaciation) or
   climatic/biological (mild superhumid climate and competition) reasons.
   The dynamics of a Nothofagus boundary was investigated by monitoring
   disturbance-initiated establishment of isolated stands of N. fusca at
   the extreme limits of its regional distribution.
   Location The: research was carried out in a regional forest ecotone
   between Nothofagus forest and podocarp-broadleaved forest in the upper
   Taramakau Valley, South island, New Zealand. The survey region straddles
   a major, active fault system and associated tectonic movements and
   earthquakes with more distant epicentres have contributed to
   intermittent canopy disturbance of the local forests.
   Methods isolated stands of Nothofagus fusca beyond the limits of
   continuous Nothofagus forest were investigated during two field surveys,
   separated by 7-10 years. Changes in population size, stem diameter of
   individual trees, stand basal area and mean annual diameter increment
   were calculated for each of fifty-four isolated stands. Types of past
   and recent disturbance and the probable cause of mortality of trees were
   noted.
   Results The total population of fifty-four sample stands, ranging in
   size from one to > 400 stems, increased by 37.4\%, and compound basal
   area increased by 4.7\% between the two surveys. Mean stem diameter
   growth of isolated stands was lower than expected by empirical data for
   N. fusca, suggesting reduced wood increment at the limits of its
   distribution. Tree mortality was 0.8\% per year. Fifty-one per cent of
   the dead stems had died as a consequence of various tl pes of natural
   disturbance, uproots being more common than snaps and crown breakage.
   Main conclusions The isolated N. fusca stands preferentially occupy
   sites likely to experience intermittent disturbance, mostly including
   disturbance of the soil cover, which facilitates their initial
   establishment and persistence. Because of causal relationships between
   mass movement on steer slopes and erosion/deposition of talus fans and
   river terraces, disturbance-initiated. changes in forest composition are
   observed across a range of different landforms.}},

Abstract = {{For the Phase I field test of the National Human Exposure Assessment
   Survey (NHEXAS) in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 5,
   this paper presents the survey sampling design, the response rates
   achieved, and the sample weighting procedure implemented to compensate
   for unit nonresponse. To enable statistically defensible inferences to
   the entire region, a sample of about 250 members of the household
   population in EPA Region 5 was selected using a stratified multistage
   probability-based survey sampling design. Sample selection proceeded in
   four nested stages: (1) sample counties; (2) area segments based on
   Census blocks within sample counties; (3) housing units (HUs) within
   sample segments; and (4) individual participants within sample
   households. Each fourth-stage sample member was asked to participate in
   6 days of exposure monitoring. A subsample of participants was asked to
   participate in two rounds of longitudinal follow-up data collection.
   Approximately 70\% of all sample households participated in household
   screening interviews in which rosters of household members were
   developed. Over 70\% of the sample subjects selected from these
   households completed the Baseline Questionnaire regarding their
   demographic characteristics and potential for exposures. And, over 75\%
   of these sample members went on to complete at least the core
   environmental monitoring, including personal exposures to volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) and tap water concentrations of metals. The
   sample weighting procedures used the data collected in the screening
   interviews for all household members to fit logistic models for
   nonresponse in the later phases of the study. Moreover, the statistical
   analysis weights were poststratified to 1994 State population
   projections obtained from the Bureau of the Census to ensure consistency
   with other statistics for the Region.}},

Title = {{Residential environmental measurements in the National Human Exposure
   Assessment Survey (NHEXAS) pilot study in Arizona: preliminary results

Abstract = {{A major objective of the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey
   (NHEXAS) performed in Arizona was to conduct residential environmental
   and biomarker measurements of selected pesticides (chlorpyrifos,
   diazinon), volatile organic compounds (VOCs; benzene, toluene,
   trichloroethene, formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene), and metals for total
   human exposure assessments. Both personal (e.g., blood, urine, dermal
   wipes, 24 h duplicate diet) and microenvironmental (e.g., indoor and
   outdoor air, house dust, foundation soil) samples were collected in each
   home in order to describe individual exposure via ingestion, inhalation,
   and dermal pathways, and to extrapolate trends to leger populations.
   This paper is a preliminary report of only the microenvironmental and
   dermal wipe data obtained for the target pesticides and VOCs, and
   provides comparisons with results from similar studies. Evaluations of
   total exposure From all sources and pathways will be addressed in future
   papers. The pesticides and VOCs all showed log-normal distributions of
   concentrations in the Arizona population sampled, and in most cases were
   detected with sufficient frequency to allow unequivocal description of
   the concentration by media at the 90th, 75th, and 50th (median)
   percentiles. Those combinations of pollutant and media, in which a large
   fraction of the measurements were below the detection limit of the
   analysis method used, included trichloroethene, 1,3-butadiene, and
   formaldehyde in outdoor air; chlorpyrifos and diazinon in outdoor air;
   and diazinon in dermal and window sill wipes. In general, indoor air
   concentrations were higher than outdoor air concentrations for all VOCs
   and pesticides investigated, and VOC levels were in good agreement with
   levels reported in other studies. In addition, the agreement obtained
   between co-located VOC samplers indicated that the low-cost diffusional
   badges used to measure concentrations are probably adequate for use in
   future monitoring studies. For the pesticides, the median levels found
   in indoor samples agreed well with other studies, although the levels
   corresponding to the upper 0.1-1\% of the population were considerably
   higher than levels reported elsewhere, with indoor air levels as high as
   3.3 and 20.5 mu g/m(3) for chlorpyrifos and diazinon, respectively.
   These data showed excellent correlation (Pearson and Spearman
   correlation coefficients of 0.998 and 0.998, respectively) between
   chlorpyrifos in indoor air and in the corresponding dermal wipes, and
   relatively poor correlation between chlorpyrifos in dust (mu g/g or mu
   g/m(2)) and dermal wipes (Pearson=0.055 mu g/g and 0.015 mu g/m(2);
   Spearman=0.644 mu g/g and 0.578 mu g/m(2)). These data suggest the
   importance of dermal penetration of semi-volatiles as a route of
   residential human exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of the Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and White
   Ibis (E. albus) is well known from sites in North America, the
   Caribbean, and the Venezuelan Ilanos, but few data are available on the
   status or breeding patterns of die populations that inhabit South
   American mangroves. From 1992-1997, we monitored the status of a colony
   off: ruber in an area of mangrove in northern Brazil. The breeding
   population numbered 2000-3400 pairs. We did not find any significant
   population fluctuations between years; apparently, most birds attempted
   to breed each year, in contrast with freshwater-breeding populations.
   Clutch size was 1.97 +/- 0.17, lower than at more northern saltwater
   sites. The low variability of clutch size was surprising, Whole nest
   failure from catastrophic events such as storms, human predation, and
   nest desertion was responsible for most egg and nestling mortality.
   Partial mortality was rare. Singleton eggs and nestlings were frequently
   abandoned by adults following the loss of an egg or nestling. We
   conclude that this population pursued a strategy of brood survival
   rather than brood reduction which is usually observed in Eudocimus. This
   may have resulted from stable resource availability at this site. Given
   that northern populations often do not breed in unfavorable years,
   selection appears to have favored adult survival over reproductive
   capacity in this species. Human disturbance was intense, and it can
   threaten ibis populations both through direct predation and induction of
   nest desertion.}},

Abstract = {{The benthic fish communities of 26 Swedish lakes were monitored annually
   with multi-mesh gillnets in a standardized way in the years 1994-1997.
   No major environmental changes (e.g. in nutrient level or acidity)
   occurred within the lakes during the 4 years of study. In most of the
   lakes, the between-year variation of biomass (per unit of effort) was
   close to the sampling precision, and biomass was usually less variable
   than abundance. Median values of lake-specific indices of variance
   compensation indicated no general covariance of biomass between species,
   but a tendency for positive covariance between size classes. This
   indicates that the benthic fish communities of small to
   intermediate-sized Swedish lakes most often show low between-year
   variation in total biomass of fish older than 0+, and that their
   biomass-size distributions are not, in general, shaped by periodic
   strong year-classes of keystone species. In a few individual lakes,
   density compensation was indicated as complementary proportions of a
   pair of species or size classes that made major contributions to the
   total biomass. (C) 1999 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon-13 decoupled H-1 spin echo NMR spectroscopy, with and without
   population inversion, was used to study carbon flow between the host,
   Meriones unguiculatus, and the parasite, Echinococcus multilocularis.
   This was accomplished by monitoring {[}2-C-13]acetate metabolism in the
   liver of jirds infected with metacestodes of this parasite. Thirty
   minutes after injection of labelled acetate solution into the portal
   vein, C-13 enrichment was observed in hepatic acetate,
   beta-hydroxybutyrate, succinate, alanine, lactate and glucose. For E.
   multilocularis cysts, at this time, C-13 enrichment was observed in the
   same metabolites as in livers and, in addition, citrate. At 120 min
   there was a significant decrease in the amount of label present in all
   hepatic metabolites whereas more label was found in the majority of the
   parasite metabolites. The results confirm that exogenous acetate,
   through randomization of the C-13 in biochemical pathways of host liver,
   ends up in hepatic glucose. As this biosynthetic route is not available
   to the parasite, the presence of C-13 enriched glucose in the cysts
   clearly indicates that the parasite is siphoning off glucose that is
   newly synthesized by the host. At 120 min some of this labelled glucose
   was stored in parasite glycogen whereas some of it had been catabolized
   to succinate, alanine, lactate and acetate, end products which are
   excreted back into the host.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing strategies should be designed to maintain vigorous populations
   of plant species critical for livestock production, wildlife habitat,
   and/or ecosystem functions. Treatments consisting of 5- to 7-day,
   mid-month grazing periods in June or July at 16, 32, or 48 animal unit
   days (AUD) per ha, were replicated 3 times and applied to the same
   pastures in 1995 and 1996 to quantify cattle use and tiller recruitment
   and mortality of prairie sandreed {[}Calamovilfa longifolia (Hook)
   Scribn.], a rhizomatous species characterized by dispersed populations
   of tillers. Cumulative grazing pressure (AUD Mg-1) was used to quantify
   treatments because of differences in phytomass among pastures and dates.
   Grazing pressure ranged from 10 to 90 AUD Mg-1 and accounted for 69, 61,
   and 77\% of the variation in percentage of tillers grazed, mean
   defoliation of grazed tillers, and use of prairie sandreed,
   respectively. As grazing pressure increased from 10 AUD Mg-1, percentage
   of tillers grazed increased from 48 to 90\%; defoliation of grazed
   tillers increased from 54 to 74\%; and utilization of prairie sandreed
   increased from 27 to 67\% at plateaus beginning at 50 to 60 AUD Mg-1.
   When spring precipitation was above average, 45 to 55\% use in June or
   July increased tiller densities, however, these increases were not
   sustained or repeated in the following year with average precipitation.
   Utilization was 50\% at 28 AUD Mg-1 and 60\% at 40 AUD Mg-1 Relatively
   large increases in utilization per-unit-change of grazing pressure below
   20 AUD Mg-1 indicated that yearling cattle selectively grazed prairie
   sandreed. The high degree of correlation between percentage of prairie
   sandreed tillers grazed and use of prairie sandreed (R-2 = 0.91 in June
   and 0.90 in July) suggests that percentage of grazed tillers can be used
   to monitor early-summer use of this species in the Nebraska Sandhills.}},

Abstract = {{A small, isolated population of Bald Eagles (Haliaeelus leucocephalus)
   breeds along the desert rivers of central Arizona. The extent to which
   it followed the continental pattern of decline during the DDT era cannot
   be known because of the paucity of data before 1970 but, from 1970-93
   the number of known breeding pairs increased from two to 34. Some of
   this growth was an artifact of increased surveys, but much was real.
   During 1987-93, territory occupancy rate was 90\%, a higher than normal
   value for the species, but nest success (45\%) and productivity (0.69
   young per occupied site, SE = 0.08) were lower than reported for other
   populations in the coterminous U.S. Much of the annual variation in
   nesting success and productivity resulted from heat stress and flooding,
   factors that impacted many breeding areas simultaneously. We recorded 41
   breeder fatalities or replacements during 262 monitored breeder/years,
   and additional fatalities and replacements likely went unrecorded. If
   replacements equated to fatalities, estimated maximum annual breeder
   survival was 0.84 (95\% C.I. 0.78-0.88), a lower value than elsewhere
   estimated. Of 131 monitored pairings during the seven pars of our
   research, 24 (18\%) contained subadults. This higher than normal rate
   for Bald Eagles suggests a paucity of floaters (nonterritorial. adults),
   although other factors may be involved. Notwithstanding these
   suggestions of reduced demographic potential, a continuing upward trend
   in the number of territories is apparent.}},

Abstract = {{The nontarget effects of temephos (as Abate(R) 4E, 44.6\% active
   ingredient) on fiddler crabs were examined on the salt marsh at Bombay
   Hook National Wildlife Refuge, near Dover, DE. Six 170 x 170-m plots
   were established; 3 were sprayed on 4 occasions at a rate of 1.5 fl
   oz/acre (0.054 kg active ingredient/ha) and 3 were controls. On each
   plot, marsh fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) populations were monitored by
   repeatedly counting the number of burrow holes in 2 counting areas
   marked out along tidal guts. One half of each counting area was covered
   with bird netting to evaluate sublethal toxic effects, which, if
   present, could result in increased susceptibility to bird predation. A
   statistically significant linear association was established between the
   number of holes and the number of crabs. No significant differences were
   found in the numbers of holes (or crabs) in the sprayed vs, control
   plots and in the covered vs. uncovered sections. However, survival of
   juvenile crabs in in situ bioassays was significantly reduced (16\%
   lower) by the spraying. Median acetylcholinesterase activity in claw
   muscle of red-jointed fiddler crabs (Uca minax) collected 2 days after
   an operational spray with Abate 4E was significantly reduced (28\%
   lower) compared to unsprayed crabs. In view of the toxicity to juvenile
   crabs and the cholinesterase inhibition, we recommend continued
   monitoring and research for nontarget impacts of Abate 4E on fiddler
   crabs to establish whether the reported level of cholinesterase
   inhibition results in acute or chronic toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The development of efficient feed management strategies in shrimp
   farming involves the investigation of aspects related to time of feed
   distribution, feeding rates, feeding frequency, and feed dispersal
   methods. This work examined the feeding levels of Penaeus subtilis in
   response to food dispersal method under semi-intensive culture
   conditions. The study consisted of two treatments: 1) a uniform feed
   dispersal over the culture area, and 2) concentration of feed in
   0.2-m(2) circular feeding trays. For each, three 105-m(2) rectangular
   enclosures were installed in a single shrimp grow-out pond and stocked
   with P. subtilis at a density of 14.29 postlarvae/m(2). Shrimp were fed
   daily at 0600, 0930 and 1430 h and sampled 30 min after feed
   distribution at 12-d intervals. After collection, shrimp weight was
   determined, their stomachs dissected and weighed. A total of 2,160
   stomachs of P, subtilis were collected during a 89-d rearing cycle.
   Relative occurrence of artificial versus natural food in stomach
   contents was determined by stable carbon isotope mass spectrometry,
   Density of polychaetes in the substrate was monitored at each sampling
   period, After harvest, sediment samples were collected for physical and
   chemical analyses. In general, differences in shrimp growth between
   feeding methods were not significant. Final shrimp survival rates were
   between 69.0 +/- 6.9\% and 71.9 +/- 3.7\%. Stomach content weight of P.
   subtilis was significantly higher when feed was broadcast than for feed
   concentration. Average stomach content weight remained constant
   throughout the rearing cycle, although progressive increases in feed
   occurrence were detected in P. subtilis diet. No periodicity in food
   intake along sampling periods could be related to increases in shrimp
   carapace length. Food intake was significantly lower at 0600 h than at
   1430 h and at 0930 h, respectively. In both treatments, over half of the
   food contained in the stomach contents of shrimp was derived from
   artificial food. Sediment chemical analysis indicated statistically
   lower levels of sodium in the pond bottom of concentrated treatment.
   However, no short-term detrimental effects were detected on sediment
   chemical quality. Results indicated that feed broadcasting resulted in a
   greater access and a higher consumption of food among the cultured
   shrimp population, a lower number of empty stomachs, and a greater
   occurrence of artificial food in P. subtilis stomach contents.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal sequence and the magnitude of the sexual reproduction and
   subsequent cyst deposition of the common spring-bloom dinoflagellate
   Scrippsiella hangoei (Schiller) Larsen was studied during spring 1996 on
   the SW coast of Finland, Baltic Sea. The abundances of the different
   size of fractions of S. hangoei (14 to 18 mu m, 18 to 22 mu m and >22 mu
   m) were monitored in the water column, and the deposition of resting
   cysts was measured using moored sediment traps. Cyst sedimentation rates
   were measured throughout the seasonal cycle in order to estimate cyst
   resuspension rates for the quantitative assessment of the fraction of
   population undergoing encystment. The onset of sexual reproduction,
   indicated by a significant increase of the small cells (14 to 18 mu m)
   representing gametes, occurred in a nutrient replete environment well
   before the exponential growth phase and peak abundances of vegetative
   cells. Gamete formation was followed by high abundances of large cells
   (>22 mu m) representing planozygotes, and subsequent sedimentation of
   resting cysts. Approximately 60\% of the asexually growing bloom
   population was estimated to form planozygotes, suggesting that
   encystment was an important factor in bloom termination and possibly
   plays a role in the regulation of the magnitude of the bloom. Finally
   encystment accounted for 40\% of the entire S. hangoei population,
   resulting in a considerable loss of the bloom population and an input of
   the vernal phytoplankton biomass to the benthos.}},

Title = {{Testing for source-sink population dynamics: an experimental approach
   exemplified with desert annuals}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models indicate that natural populations may be structured
   in such a way that many individuals occur in habitats where reproduction
   is insufficient to balance mortality. The persistence of such `sink'
   populations depends on immigration from neighboring `source' habitats
   where local reproduction exceeds mortality. While source-sink dynamics
   has become a fundamental concept in ecological theory, there has been
   virtually no experimental test for the existence of sources and sinks in
   natural populations. This paper reports the results of a four-year study
   that was designed to experimentally test for source-sink population
   dynamics in desert annual communities. Based on evidence from a variety
   of desert ecosystems indicating that patchiness caused by the presence
   of shrubs is important in structuring desert annual communities, we
   distinguished between two types of habitats: areas beneath the canopy of
   shrubs and the open areas between the shrubs. If, as suggested in
   previous studies, source-sink dynamics are important in structuring such
   annual communities, one would expect that removal of populations from
   one habitat would lead to extinction of some species in the other
   habitat. We tested this prediction using removal experiments. We
   monitored density responses of annual populations inhabiting open areas
   to the repeated removal of conspecific populations from under shrubs and
   vice versa. Four years after establishment of the experiment, none of
   the 34 species studied responded to the removal treatments with
   habitat-specific extinction. Only one species exhibited a significant
   habitat-specific decrease in density in response to the removal of
   conspecific populations from the other habitat. These findings
   contradict our expectations based on conventional theory and point to
   the importance of applying an experimental approach in studies of
   source-sink dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii G., is a widespread agricultural pest
   and many populations around the world display resistance to pirimicarb.
   This resistance originates mainly from acetylcholinesterase
   modification. Hydrolysis of 14 carbamate and organophosphate
   insecticides by altered acetylcholinesterase of a resistant strain from
   southern France has been analyzed. It appeared that the modified enzyme
   provides a specific resistance to pirimicarb but also a greater
   sensitivity to bendiocarb. Bioassays showed that the resistant strain
   was slightly more sensitive to bendiocarb. Utilization of this
   antiresistance property was tested in the laboratory: a mixed population
   containing 50\% pirimicarb-resistant and 50\% pirimicarb-susceptible
   aphids was established and repetitively treated with bendiocarb.
   Frequency of resistant individuals in this population was monitored and
   compared to that of a nontreated mixed population. Treatments with
   bendiocarb delayed the increase of resistant individuals but as the
   resistant strain displayed a higher fitness than the sensitive strain
   and as antiresistance was weak, this selection assay did not allow the
   population to revert. These data showed that application of this
   strategy in fields requires compounds displaying high antiresistance
   properties. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The occupational airborne exposure to benzene of 150 workers employed in
   petrol stations and a refinery plant was assessed using personal
   sampling pumps. Ail workers provided blood samples after the end of work
   and on the following morning before resuming work. Benzene
   concentrations in the blood of 243 non-occupationally-exposed subjects
   were also measured. The median occupational benzene exposure for all 150
   workers studied was 80 mu g/m(3). overall median brood benzene of ail
   workers was 251 ng/l at the end of the shift, and 174 ng/l the following
   morning. The benzene concentrations measured in blood collected the
   following morning proved to be significantly lower than those measured
   at the end of the shift. Median blood benzene for the 243 `normal'
   subjects was 128 ng/l, which was significantly lower than that measured
   in the workers before a new work shift. The median blood benzene
   concentration was significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers,
   both in the general population (210 ng/l vs. 110 ng/l) and in the
   exposed workers at the end of the shift (476 ng/l vs. 132 ng/l) and the
   following morning (360 ng/l vs. 99 ng/l). End-of-shift blood benzene
   correlated significantly with environmental exposure; this correlation
   was better in the 83 non-smokers than in the 67 smokers. In non-smokers
   with the median benzene occupational exposure of 50 mu g/m(3), no
   difference was found in blood benzene concentration in exposed and
   non-exposed subjects. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Swan Basin in Montana is considered a stronghold of regional
   significance for the bull trout Salvelinus confluentus, a native char
   whose populations are fragmented and declining throughout its range. We
   used correlation analysis to examine spatial and temporal variation of
   bull trout redd count data (1982-1995) relative to geomorphic and
   land-use factors among nine principal spawning tributaries of the Swan
   River. Bull trout redd numbers were positively correlated with the
   extent of alluvial valley segments bounded by knickpoints and negatively
   correlated with the density of logging roads in spawning tributary
   catchments. The density of logging roads in spawning tributary
   catchments was not significantly correlated with geomorphic factors,
   Temporal trends among the principal spawning streams were variable. Tn
   four of the nine principal spawning streams, redd numbers increased
   significantly during the survey period, and in the remaining streams,
   redd numbers showed no significant change. Changes in redd numbers with
   time were negatively correlated with catchment road density and
   positively correlated with the extent of bounded alluvial valley
   segments. The significance of bounded alluvial valley segments to bull
   trout spawning habitat may be related to groundwater-surface water
   exchange occurring within these segments. Our results emphasize the
   importance of valley geomorphology to bull trout, and our results
   suggest that prior land use may have adversely affected bull trout
   populations in the Swan Basin. Protection of critical spawning tributary
   catchments from additional road building and associated land-use
   disturbance will likely be necessary for the maintenance of viable bull
   trout populations in the Swan Basin. Geomorphic context and land-use
   status of spawning tributaries are important considerations for future
   monitoring and management of this species.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of hunter observations (moose seen per hunter day) as a
   source for various population parameters in moose Alces alces L was
   evaluated. We found an overall positive correlation between density and
   observation index. The strength of the relationship was similar in all
   of the three counties studied. The observation index levelled off with
   increasing density (>1.0 moose/km(2)). Sightability of moose differed
   significantly among two of the three counties studied which makes
   comparisons between the regions difficult. However, adjusting the
   regional observation index by independent estimates of population size
   enables comparisons over larger areas. We found a probability of 0.81
   that a change in observation index also reflects the direction of a
   change in population size. The reproductive rate calculated from hunter
   observations (Sigma calves)/(Sigma females) was correlated with the
   observed mean recorded reproductive rate among radio-collared moose in a
   county. Furthermore, moose reproduction as estimated from hunter
   observations was positively correlated among counties in northern Sweden
   indicating large-scale synchrony. Our findings indicate that hunter
   observations of moose reflect moose population size and reproductive
   rate reasonably well, and can be used to monitor population
   fluctuations. If calibrated, one may use observation indices for
   estimates of population size in local moose management as an alternative
   or supplement to more costly monitoring methods. If not calibrated,
   observational data may be misleading if they are used as a density
   indicator.}},

Abstract = {{with the increasing popularity of remote photography in wildlife
   research, a large variety of equipment and methods is available to
   researchers. To evaluate advantages and disadvantages of using various
   types of equipment for different study objectives, we reviewed 107
   papers that used either time-lapse or animal-triggered photography to
   study vertebrates in the field. Remote photography was used primarily to
   study avian nest predation, feeding ecology, and nesting behavior;
   additional applications included determining activity patterns,
   presence-absence monitoring, and estimating population parameters. Using
   time-lapse equipment is most appropriate when animals occur frequently
   in the photographic frame, the activity of interest occurs repeatedly,
   or no distinct event occurs to trigger a camera. In contrast,
   animal-triggered (light or mechanically triggered) systems are
   appropriate when events occur infrequently or unpredictably and there is
   a great likelihood that a trigger will be activated. Remote photography
   can be less time consuming, costly, and invasive than traditional
   research methods for many applications. However, researchers should be
   prepared to invest time and money troubleshooting problems with remote
   camera equipment, be aware of potential effects of equipment on animal
   behavior, and recognize the limitations of data collected with remote
   photography equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Damage by black (Coragyps atratus) and turkey (Catharates aura) vultures
   increased annually since 1990, when 2 complaints were reported, and
   peaked at 207 complaints in 1995. Black vultures are associated with
   depredations of livestock and pets and damage to real and personal
   property. Congregations of mixed flocks of black and turkey vultures are
   associated with health concerns, property damage, and nuisance
   complaints. Turkey vultures are infrequently identified as a problem
   compared to black vultures and mixed flocks. Vulture damage was reported
   in 55 counties and 2 cities in Virginia from October 1994 to 1996. Black
   vultures were reported to kill cattle or carves in 32 counties, with
   76\% of statewide livestock predation reported from Southwestern Ridge
   and Valley and Southern Piedmont physiographic regions. Eleven counties
   reported black vultures killing other livestock, including farm-raised
   deer. Twelve counties reported black vultures killing, injuring, and
   harassing pets. While there is a range of nonlethal techniques to
   alleviate black vulture predation on livestock-including harassment with
   pyrotechnics or center-fire rifles, removing carrion, moving expectant
   cattle to alternate pastures, relocating nearby vulture roosts by
   harassment with pyrotechnics, and monitoring livestock several times a
   day-these techniques frequently were ineffective. The lethal method
   recommended to reduce or stop black vulture predation on livestock was
   shooting a few vultures to supplement harassment. New research is needed
   to develop control methods to alleviate vulture damage and develop
   vulture population models.}},

Abstract = {{Management objectives and habitat conditions for red-cockaded
   woodpeckers (RCW Picoides borealis) often differ between public and
   private lands, yet most research related to this species has been
   conducted on public lands. Thus, research addressing RCW-habitat
   relationships on private lands is needed to assist private landowners in
   blending economic objectives with those for RCWs. We monitored
   reproductive performance of RCW groups on private lands in Louisiana
   from 1993-1995. Each year we also measured area of suitable foraging
   habitat, amount of foraging substrate, and landscape characteristics
   within 400 m and 800 m of cluster centers. RCW groups successfully
   reproduced in a variety of habitat conditions; some did not meet current
   United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) guidelines. Productivity
   of groups observed in this study was comparable to that recently
   reported for other populations. Variables traditionally used to describe
   foraging substrate (e.g., stems and basal area {[}ba] for pines greater
   than or equal to 25.4-cm diameter at breast height {[}dbh]) and measures
   of habitats often considered unsuitable (e.g., area of regenerating
   forest) were not related to RCW group size or measures of reproduction.
   In contrast, landscape metrics (i.e., dominance, fractal dimension,
   Taylor's index of patchiness) were related. Our data suggest that
   variables currently used in USFWS guidelines may not adequately measure
   foraging habitat quality in intensively managed forests.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of different clonal strains of
   Symbiodinium sp. (zooxanthellae) on clam growth and survival, while
   monitoring the persistence of the induced symbioses in outdoor tanks and
   in the held using allozyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
   analyses. Aposymbiotic clam larvae that were inoculated with homologous
   zooxanthellae (cultured or freshly isolated from the same host species)
   or heterologous zooxanthellae (cultured from different host species) had
   significantly-different survival rates at harvest (3 months
   post-spawning) with small growth differences. The improved survival
   rates in juvenile Hippopus hippopus (heterologous infection) and
   Tridacna gigas (homologous infection) were maintained through 3 months
   onshore and 3 months offshore. However, isozyme and RAPD analyses of
   re-isolated zooxanthellae after 3, 6, and 9 months revealed a high
   genetic diversity of symbionts (ca. 99\% variation in 200 re-isolates)
   from individual hosts, within and between treatments. Furthermore, the
   genetic patterns of the re-isolated algae following clonal culture were
   different from those of the introduced clones, which, in contrast,
   retained their unique genetic patterns over many culture generations in
   the laboratory. These results demonstrate that the
   subsequently-established symbiont populations in juvenile clams were not
   clonal. The allozyme and RAPD techniques detected individual genetic
   differences in clam symbionts, but not differences between algal taxa.
   The presence of significant survival trends suggests possible
   differences between subsequently-established dominant symbiont taxa,
   which were uncultureable or undetectable using these genetic markers.
   The implications of this symbiont diversity in giant clams are
   discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Smelting and maturation of 2+ brown trout Salmo trutta L. were evaluated
   after exposing the groups of trout to different feeding regimes during
   the summers at 0+ and 1+ ages. The hypothesis tested was based on the
   theory of smelting of a congeneric species, Atlantic salmon Salmo salar
   L., in which the physiological smelting decision is expected to be taken
   at the end of July or beginning of August. During the first summer, the
   growth of the trout was restricted in two groups out of four by low
   feeding frequency. During the second summer, food was totally withheld
   for 3 weeks in June-July (i.e. before the expected sensitive period), in
   August or not at all (control), The proportion of sexually mature males
   in November was 5.2\% in the groups fasted during August, but somewhat
   lower in the groups fasted in June-July (average 2.3\%) or in control
   fish (3\%). The tendency for smelting was evaluated during the following
   spring in an artificial stream with the help of PIT-tag technology,
   which allowed monitoring of the movements of individually tagged trout.
   Seawater challenge tests were also carried out in April and Tune.
   Differences in osmoregulatory ability in seawater indicated that feeding
   treatments had a slight effect on the timing of smolting, but no
   differences were observed in movement behaviour between treatment
   groups, Mature and maturing males moved less at the peak migration time
   (mid-May) but more in October than immature fishes, These results
   suggest that the smelting decision in brown trout may be taken at a
   different time than in Atlantic salmon and that periodic poor growth
   conditions during the summer will not prevent smelting of trout, during
   the following spring.}},

Abstract = {{Information about the effects of agriculturally derived insecticide
   input on the aquatic fauna in the field is sparse. Runoff-related
   insecticide input and the resulting toxicological effects on the aquatic
   fauna (abundance, drift, emergence) at three sampling sites at different
   distances (450-1150 m) from the input location of contaminated
   edge-of-field runoff (erosion rill) were investigated. By means of
   event-triggered sampling it was shown that the transient (about 1 h)
   insecticide contamination in the stream was very high (e.g. 6 mu g l(-1)
   parathion-ethyl in water. 302 mu g kg(-1) fenvalerate in suspended
   particulates). The rates of loss of applied substance calculated on the
   basis of the application rate, the concentrations measured in the
   stream, and discharge data for both insecticides were below 0.1\%, the
   value usually reported in the literature. The measured insecticide
   contamination in the stream had a strong negative effect on the aquatic
   macroinvertebrate community. Eight of the 11 common species vanished
   from 19 May on for a period of 3-6 months, although their life cycles
   include much longer aquatic stages. The remaining three species were
   significantly (P < 0.001) reduced in their population density, although
   in their normal life cycle the population density would increase due to
   summer reproduction. These effects were observed for the entire
   longitudinal stream section investigated (up to 1150 m from the
   edge-of-field runoff location). In contrast, the increase of drift rate
   (mainly G. pulex) and of the mortality in the drift (mainly caddisfly
   species), declined with increasing distance from the runoff site. The
   comparison of runoff events with and without insecticide contamination
   substantiates the crucial importance of the insecticide contamination
   for the observed effects. There was no correlation between the hydraulic
   component (discharge), turbidity or nutrient content and the observed
   toxicological effects (decrease in number of species, increased drift;
   increased mortality in the drift) on the aquatic fauna. Considering all
   these facts, it can be concluded that agricultural insecticide input may
   play an important role in the dynamics of macroinvertebrate communities
   in agricultural streams. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Between 1986 and 1993, the roan antelope Hippotragus equinus population
   in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, declined from about 450 to
   ca.45 animals. Data from long term monitoring of herbivore numbers, sex,
   age and herd structure and of vegetation condition, supported by spatial
   and demographic modelling and predator sighting records, were used to
   evaluate potential causes of the population decrease, including: (1)
   competition from zebra and wildebeest, which moved into the roan's range
   after the introduction of waterpoints; (2) increased predation following
   the influx of zebra and wildebeest; (3) habitat deterioration due to an
   extended period of low rainfall; (4) outbreaks of the disease anthrax;
   and (5) stress associated with immunisation against anthrax. Evidence
   did not support the latter two causes. Drought alone was inadequate as
   an explanation, although progressive desiccation over a sequence of low
   rainfall years, and resultant grassland deterioration, may have been
   contributory. Grassland recovery may have been suppressed by grazing
   pressure from zebra and wildebeest. The population crash was associated
   with an increase in adult mortality, but little apparent change in calf
   survival, suggesting that nutritional factors were not the prime cause.
   Increased predation on adult roan due to a build-up in lion numbers,
   following the zebra and wildebeest influx, seemed to be the proximate
   cause of the initial sharp decline in the roan population. However, the
   ultimate cause was the provision of numerous artificial waterpoints in
   the roan range, which attracted the influx of zebra and wildebeest,
   particularly during drought conditions. Following the closure of
   waterpoints in a section of the roan range, the roan herds in the
   vicinity are recovering. Deficiencies in current monitoring programmes
   in the Kruger Park are identified. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Lacerta schreiberi is an endemic lizard in the northwest of the Iberian
   Peninsula, with some isolated populations in the south. The aims of this
   work are to select priority areas for the conservation of the species,
   identify extinction risk areas, evaluate the current degree of
   protection and define a strategy for the conservation of this species in
   Portugal. We used an evaluation model of areas in a GIS environment.
   Conservation priority areas represent 15\% of the distribution area of
   the species in Portugal. Populations with high risk of extinction are
   located primarily along the littoral strip. About 50\% of the
   conservation priority areas are already included in the Portuguese
   protected areas (PPA). The conservation strategy for the species needs
   efficient protection of habitats, increase of PPA and creation of
   Regional Reserves for the littoral populations. For the isolated
   populations we propose five types of management actions: habitat
   restoration, supplementation of populations, reintroduction of
   individuals, captive breeding and population monitoring. (C) 1999

   knockdown times of pyrethroid resistant strains of A. stephensi and A.
   gambiae were significantly shorter if they were 10 days old (either fed
   or unfed), as compared with those of newly emerged mosquitoes. Based on
   KT50 values, the resistance ratios between resistant and susceptible A.
   stephensi were 3.5 and 2.2 for the newly emerged and 10-day-old
   mosquitoes, respectively. After Ih exposure to paper impregnated with
   0.25\% permethrin, mortality of newly emerged individuals of the
   susceptible and resistant strains of A. stephensi was significantly less
   than when they were 10 days old. Irritability by permethrin was less
   with the resistant strain of A. stephensi. In the other strains
   irritability declined significantly with age. Pre-exposure of
   susceptible mosquitoes of BEECH and IRAQ strains of A. stephensi for a
   short time to permethrin did not increase tolerance when the mosquitoes
   were re-exposed 24 h later. Because of the age effect and the
   possibility of an effect of pre-exposure under some circumstances,
   confirmatory tests on newly emerged F-1 individuals reared from wild

Abstract = {{I studied the breeding biology of Crested Caracaras (Caracara plancus)
   in south-central Florida from 1994 through 1996. Reproductive activity
   was monitored year-round on 30, 48, and 55 territories, respectively.
   Pairs remained on breeding territories throughout the year and exhibited
   strong fidelity to the nest site between years; however, annual turnover
   rate among known breeding individuals was approximately 18\%.
   Territorial occupancy and breeding rates on known occupied territories
   averaged 95\% and 98\%, respectively. Observed patterns of breeding
   activity and nesting success suggested a link between reproduction and
   precipitation. Active nests were found from September through June, but
   most nesting activity corresponded with the dry season, November through
   April. Egg laying in many pairs occurred following an abrupt decline in
   precipitation in the fall each year. The overall probability of a nest
   producing at least one independent young was 72\%; however, nest success
   varied throughout the breeding season, being lowest and most variable
   for early- and late-season nests. Based on 98 nests with complete
   records, mean clutch size was 2.23 eggs, 61.2\% of nestlings fledged
   successfully, and 48.4\% of all eggs laid resulted in independent young.
   Clutches of three produced the most independent young per breeding
   attempt in all years. Annual population productivity was enhanced
   because pairs made more than one nesting attempt per breeding season,
   either by renesting following an early season failure or by producing
   second broods. Clutch size, probability of nest success, probability of
   renesting, and number of fledglings produced per attempt all declined as
   the breeding season progressed. Mortality factors included weather,
   predation, chicks falling out of nests, and vehicle collisions with
   fledglings. Environmental variability may influence spatial and temporal
   variation in timing of reproduction and nesting success of Crested
   Caracaras in Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation biologists have used surrogate species as a shortcut to
   monitor or solve conservation problems. Indicator species have been used
   to assess the magnitude of anthropogenic disturbance, to monitor
   population trends in other species, and to locate areas of high regional
   biodiversity. Umbrella species have been used to delineate the type of
   habitat or size of area for protection, and flagship species have been
   employed to attract public attention. Unfortunately, there has been
   considerable confusion over these terms and several have been applied
   loosely and interchangeably. We attempt to provide some clarification
   and guidelines for the application of these different terms. For each
   type of surrogate, we briefly describe the way it has been used in
   conservation biology and then examine the criteria that managers and
   researchers use in selecting appropriate surrogate species By
   juxtaposing these concepts, it becomes clear that both the goals and
   selection criteria of different surrogate classes differ substantially,
   indicating that they should not be conflated This can be facilitated by
   first outlining The goals of a conservation study, explicitly stating
   the criteria involved in selecting a surrogate species, identifying a
   species according to these criteria, and then performing a pilot study
   to check whether the choice of species was appropriate before addressing
   the conservation problem itself Surrogate species need to be used with
   gl eater care if they are to remain useful in conservation biology.}},

Abstract = {{Phytophagous insects which feed on the leaves of herbaceous host plants
   have to adapt their life histories to the fact that protein nitrogen is
   usually highest in growing tissues in spring. We monitored field
   populations of larvae and adults of three chrysomelid species (Galeruca
   tanaceti (L.) (main host Achillea millefolium (L.) Yarrow), Cassida
   rubiginosa (Mueller) (main host Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) and Oreina
   luctuosa (Suffrian) (host Centaurea scabiosa (L.)) together with the
   amount of protein nitrogen of their food resources and host plant
   biomass. As expected, the development of host quality, measured as
   concentration of protein nitrogen, and host plant biomass showed inverse
   trends during the season. The euryphagous G. tanaceti attacks Achillea
   early and profits from high nitrogen concentrations in the leaves.
   Occasional overexploitations of local populations of Achillea are
   compensated by the capacity to move to other host species. In C.
   rubiginosa, a species with a host range restricted to the Cardueae, the
   main larval feeding activity is postponed to a period when the nitrogen
   content of the host leaves had dropped to 50\% of its initial value, but
   when host plant biomass had increased by 30\%. In the monophagous O.
   luctuosa the larval development is synchronized with a still later phase
   of host phenology, at which the nitrogen content is below 50\% but plant
   biomass has reached its maximum. There seem to be selection factors,
   which oppose the use of high quality food in spring and which force the
   latter two species to postpone their larval development to a later time
   in the year. This could be caused by numerous factors like, for example,
   mean daytime temperature. Later in the season the larvae have to cope
   with the low quality of their host plants. They have, however, the
   advantage of large quantities of food available.
   A laboratory study with adults and mature larvae of O. luctuosa shows
   that this species can overcome low levels of protein nitrogen either by
   selecting younger leaves with higher nitrogen concentrations or by
   increasing the daily food consumption rate (RCR) on leaves with a low
   level of nitrogen and by a prolongation of the feeding period. In this
   way the larvae compensate the effect of lower daily growth rates (RGR)
   and a lower food conversion index (ECI) on poor food quality: Regardless
   of the level of protein nitrogen there was no statistically significant
   difference in total gain of weight during the third-instar feeding
   period and in the weight at the end of the third larval stage. The three
   investigated chrysomelids show that there exists a broad spectrum of
   adaptations to overcome the dilemma of variable food quality.}},

Abstract = {{DNA array technology makes it possible to rapidly genotype individuals
   or quantify the expression of thousands of genes on a single filter or
   glass slide, and holds enormous potential in toxicologic applications.
   This potential led to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored
   workshop titled ``Application of Microarrays to Toxicology{''} on 7-8
   January 1999 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. In addition to
   providing state-of-the-art information on the application of DNA or gene
   microarrays, the workshop catalyzed the formation of several
   collaborations, committees, and user's groups throughout the Research
   Triangle Park area and beyond. Potential application of microarrays to
   toxicologic research and risk assessment include genome-wide expression
   analyses to identify gene-expression networks and toxicant-specific
   signatures that can be used to define mode of action, for exposure
   assessment, and for environmental monitoring. Arrays may also prove
   useful for monitoring genetic variability and its relationship to
   toxicant susceptibility in human populations.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetative and reproductive growth of individually marked plants of the
   brown alga Himanthalia elongata was monitored over 25 years at two sites
   with different wave exposures on the Irish west coast. Macro-recruits
   were first visible to the unaided eye in February/March. About 65\% of
   all buttons produced receptacles during autumn of the same year, whereas
   others remained sterile. Growth of receptacles started between late
   August and late November, when vegetative plants were 9-14 months old,
   but no further plants became reproductive after December. At both sites,
   length increase of receptacles was greatest between February and April,
   but only longitudinal growth occurred and no more new dichotomies were
   produced. At the more wave-exposed site, growth was fastest in plants
   growing in red algal turfs and slowest in plants on open rock. Growth
   rates were maximal when seawater temperatures were 10-12 degrees C in
   early spring but decreased from May onwards with the maturation of
   receptacles aged 7-9 months in June. Release of viable gametes started
   in June and continued throughout the autumn and winter, until all plants
   disappeared from the population in February. Plant density was highest
   in March after the appearance of macro-recruits in the population, and
   declined during summer when the number of buttons decreased. Percentage
   plant cover was highest in June immediately before the onset of gamete
   release and this was followed by the decay and disintegration of
   receptacles. Since both survival and growth of young buttons was highest
   in red algal turfs and lowest on exposed rocks, the distribution of H.
   elongata on semi-exposed shores in Ireland may be limited by the
   availability of suitable micro-habitats for recruitment, and reduced by
   the early loss of fertile, adult plants from exposed sites.}},

Abstract = {{A new species of the widespread genus Mesophyllum Lemoine is described.
   Mesophyllum macedonis nov. sp. grows in shallow (c. 0.5 m depth) waters,
   tolerating wide temperature fluctuations (12-26 degrees C) at a salinity
   of 32-35 parts per thousand, protected from direct wave and light
   exposure. The species forms weakly attached rose-coloured clumps with
   whitish margins on rocky substrata. Its thallus is composed of
   superimposed foliose lamellae (to 170 mu m thick) with dorsiventral
   organization, non-coaxial hypothallium, limited perithallial growth (to
   60 mu m thick), rectangular epithallial cells and solitary terminal
   trichocytes. Tetrasporangial conceptacles are raised and have convex
   roofs perforated by up to 108 pores that are bordered by filaments
   composed of slender and occasionally elongated cells. Tetrasporophytes
   were first observed in 1984 and their occurrence monitored without
   finding gametophytes or other populations at the type locality or
   elsewhere on the coast of the Sithonia Peninsula. A comparative study of
   literature data and material of selected congeners shows that M.
   macedonis shares most of its characters with M. ornatum (Foslie ei Howe)
   nov, comb. from the Bahamas and Mariana Islands, and M. incisum (Foslie)
   Adey from southern Australia and New Zealand. Biogeographic scenarios
   that may explain the restricted distribution of the new Mediterranean
   endemic are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Five-thousand wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) smelts, from Conne
   River, Newfoundland, were captured during their downstream migration in
   May 1995, and transferred to an estuarine aquaculture rearing site at
   Roti Bay, 23 km away. Survival was monitored throughout the experiment.
   The greatest mortality occurred in July, approximately 6-8 weeks
   following transfer. Survival of smelts. to one-sea-winter salmon was
   18.5\%, over four times higher than the average survival of wild salmon
   to Conne River during the past 6 years. Growth was monitored at monthly
   intervals until November 1995, with additional sampling in the spring
   and early summer of 1996. Survivors were split into two groups and
   released directly into the Bay d'Espoir fjord; one group was released
   27-28 June 1996, at a site approximately 7 lan from the mouth of Conne
   River. The second group was retained at Roti Bay and released 23: July
   1996. Lotek radio transmitter tags were used in evaluating the success
   of the experiment by tracking migration timing and subsequent
   distribution of cage-reared salmon throughout the Conne River system.
   Approximately 80\% returned to Come River and 20\% strayed to other
   streams. Less than 50\% of the surviving fish were later accounted for
   in local Bay d'Espoir rivers. Results are discussed in relation to the
   utility of this technique to enhance salmon populations. (C) 1999

Title = {{The population dynamics of Anisantha sterilis in winter wheat:
   comparative demography and the role of management}},

Abstract = {{1. We report on a 3-year field study designed to monitor the detailed
   population dynamics of Anisantha sterilis in winter wheat, as well as to
   explore the consequences of changing broad-scale patterns of management,
   in the form of reduced fertilizer inputs.
   2. In the absence of herbicides, population dynamics were dominated by
   density-dependent population growth. Unusually, this occurred mainly
   through density-dependent recruitment. This was estimated to reduce
   population growth rates by 50-fold, compared with the effects of
   density-dependent competition between plants for resources.
   Density-dependent recruitment also tended to buffer populations against
   year-to-year variations in emergence levels.
   3. Little evidence for temporal variations in allometric seed
   production, the strength of competition between plants for resources or
   maximal mean plant performance was found in this study, or in comparison
   with previously published data.
   4. No aspect of the life cycle was significantly affected by variation
   in the level of applied nitrogen fertilizer. In the case of competitive
   interactions we postulate that this lack of effect results from reduced
   intraspecific competitive effects as a consequence of decreased maximal
   plant size under low nitrogen conditions. The highly competitive nature
   of the environment in which A. sterilis occurs means that such changes
   tend to mask the effects of changing nitrogen levels.
   5. Estimates of the effects of cultivation, on the other hand, indicated
   that seed germination, and hence population growth, was reduced by up to
   90\% when ploughing was employed rather than minimum tillage. While to
   some extent the effects of variation in the form of cultivation on
   population numbers may be buffered by density-dependent recruitment,
   this effect outweighs any effects of nutrients or spatial or temporal
   variability in population dynamics.
   6. Using previously published models for the dynamics of Alopecurus
   myosuroides, Avena sterilis and Avena fatua, we show that the response
   of populations of Anisantha sterilis to cultivation is very different
   from that of other grass weeds. In addition we show how single species
   models for population dynamics may be used to predict the responses of
   weed assemblages to changes in forms of management.}},

Abstract = {{1. Rangeland grasshopper movement was studied in Wyoming, USA, with
   respect to the biological and ecological factors (population density,
   developmental stage and weather) influencing net displacement and
   directionality.
   2. A novel adaptation of the mark-recapture method was developed to
   monitor grasshopper dispersal. The method used fluorescent powder and
   resighting marked grasshoppers in the field with ultraviolet light,
   rather than physical recapturing of individuals.
   3. Rangeland grasshoppers exhibited a strong tendency for directional
   movement. Adult grasshoppers demonstrated a significant tendency for
   dispersal in a northwesterly direction across a range of population
   densities (5-8, 10-15 and greater than or equal to 18 grasshoppers
   m(-2)). Although not a definitive explanation, weather might have
   influenced this behaviour, as the grasshoppers consistently moved
   upwind.
   4. The mean displacement of grasshoppers in a 36-h period ranged from
   2.3 m in nymphs to 3.7 m in adults, with the distance of displacement
   being positively correlated with population density.
   5. An understanding of grasshopper movement in terms of directionality
   and displacement has immediate applicability to reduced agent-area
   treatments for range-land grasshopper management.}},

Abstract = {{The role of induced responses of tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum, in
   interspecific interactions between two polyphagous herbivores, the
   silver-leaf whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii (WF), and the vegetable
   leafminer, Liriomyza trifolii (LM), was characterized in laboratory and
   field experiments. Feeding by LMs and WFs induced local and systemic
   production of putative defensive proteins, i.e., chitinases,
   peroxidases, beta-1,3-glucanases, and lysozymes. The magnitude of the
   induction for each defensive protein varied between species. Unlike WFs,
   LMs caused a 33\% local reduction in total foliar protein content. In a
   whole-plant choice experiment, adult LM feeding, oviposition, and larval
   survival were reduced by 47.7\%, 30.7\%, and 26.5\%, respectively, for
   the WF-infested host compared with the controls. Early WF infestations
   also had negative systemic (plant-mediated) effects on LMs. Adult LMs
   preferred leaves from control plants to leaves of plants that had been
   previously infested with WFs; no reciprocal effect of LMs on WFs were
   found. Feeding by Helicoverpa tea larvae, which has been shown
   previously to affect LM performance, had no effect on WF survival and
   development. LM natural population dynamics were monitored on
   WF-preinfested and control plants in a field experiment. WF-infested
   plants were less suitable for LM development with an overall 41\%
   reduction in LM population density. These results demonstrate asymmetric
   direct and plant-mediated interspecific interactions between generalist
   herbivores feeding simultaneously on the same host. Possible mechanisms
   by which WFs overcome plant defenses are suggested. This ability may
   also contribute to WF success that makes them a major pest worldwide.
   The study supports the idea that over an evolutionary time scale,
   herbivores sharing the same host plant will automatically compete.}},

Abstract = {{A citrus leaf disk bioassay was developed to monitor the susceptibility
   of citrus rust mite, Phylloroptruta oleivora (Ashmead), populations to
   abamectin. Disks from leaves of several citrus cultivars were equally
   suitable bioassay substrates, and there was no difference in mortality
   when mites were sprayed directly or exposed to dry abamectin residue.
   The concentration-response relationship was determined at intervals over
   2 yr for a reference population of citrus rust mites that had been
   maintained in culture and never exposed to acaricides. Three diagnostic
   concentrations of abamectin were selected based on the response of the
   reference population and were used to test the susceptibility of 15
   populations of mites from commercial citrus groves. Comparisons with the
   reference population showed reduced levels of susceptibility in some
   populations. Populations of citrus rust mites from 6 commercial groves
   were sprayed twice in 1997 with combinations of acaricides designed to
   exert different intensities of selection pressure from abamectin. None
   of these populations showed a change in their response to abamectin in
   pre- and postspray bioassays, although their susceptibility was usually
   less than that of mites from the susceptible reference population.
   Biweekly counts of rust mites on fruit in these 6 groves suggested that,
   relative to groves which received no abamectin or 1 abamectin spray.
   mite control was not adversely affected in the groves sprayed twice with
   abamectin. The bioassay method is discussed in relation to factors that
   affect the interpretation of results from its use, and factors that may
   affect the development of resistance to abamectin in citrus rust mite
   populations are presented. This study has provided baseline data with
   which the results of ongoing tests of the response of citrus rust mite
   populations to abamectin can be compared.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated exposure monitoring system, based on
   an expansion of existing air quality monitoring systems using dispersion
   modelling. The system allows: (1) identifying geographical areas whose
   inhabitants are most exposed to ambient pollution; (2) identifying how
   many people in an area are exposed to concentrations of pollution
   exceeding air quality guidelines; (3) describing the exposure of
   population subgroups (e.g. children); (4) planning pollution abatement
   measures and quantifying their effects: (5) establishing risk assessment
   and management programs, and (6) investigating the short- and long-term
   effects of both pollutants and pollution sources on public health, The
   effect of pollution is rarely very large and in order to discover it:
   exposure estimation must provide data that reflects both spatial and
   temporal variations. Estimates of pollution exposure are obtained using
   an integrated approach that combines results of measurements from
   monitoring programs with dispersion calculations. These values can serve
   as estimates for individual short-term or long-term exposure. The
   grouped data allows the expression of ambient pollution concentrations
   as the spatial distribution of estimates such as the mean or 98th
   percentile of such compounds as SO2, O-3, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5. This
   integrated approach has been combined into a single software package,

Abstract = {{The air pollution dispersion model EPISODE has been developed at the
   Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) over the past several years
   in order to meet the needs of modern air quality management work in
   urban areas. The model has recently been used as a basis for exposure
   calculations of NOx and NO2 in order to assess the effects of different
   traffic diversion measures on health and well being for the residents in
   the Valerenga-Ekeberg-Gamlebyen area in Oslo, Here we describe some
   results from the most recent evaluations of the model for NOx and NO2 at
   station Nordahl Brunsgate in Oslo for the period 1 October 1996-19
   November 1996. In addition examples of population exposure calculations
   for Oslo performed during the winter period of 1995-96, are also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Timing, distances, and durations of above-ground activity were monitored
   during three successive years in wild populations of dwarf hamsters
   (Phodopus). Both P. campbelli (Djungarian hamsters) and P. sungorus
   (Siberian hamsters) were nocturnal. However, P. campbelli arose earlier
   (before dark or soon after dark versus well after dark) and remained
   above ground 2.5 times longer than P. sungorus. Longer expeditions
   allowed female P. campbelli to travel farther than both sexes of P.
   sungorus at the same speed. In contrast, P. campbelli males were active
   for the same amount of time as females but travelled almost three times
   faster, covering much greater distances and larger areas. Patterns of
   wheel running by females in the laboratory confirmed the earlier onset
   and longer duration of activity in P. campbelli, demonstrating that
   differences between species in the wild were not simply responses to
   different environmental stimuli. Activity before and after dark and
   prolonged activity throughout the dark are interpreted as evidence that
   resource acquisition in the colder, drier, more seasonal habitat of P.
   campbelli requires more energy and time than resource acquisition in
   habitat of P. sungorus. As such, constraints on energy and time during
   the breeding season may have been important in the evolution of
   biparental care in P. campbelli but not P. sungorus.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of roost-switching behavior and roost reuse were investigated
   in the threatened New Zealand long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus
   tuberculatus) in temperate rainforest. A total of 371 roosts was
   monitored for 503 roost-days after radiotracking 58 bats. Bats were
   solitary (37.3\%) or communal (62.7\%). Colonies were small, averaging
   34.7 bats +/- 23.4 SD. Reproductive females dominated colonies, and
   males roosted more often by themselves. C. tuberculatus differed from
   other species of bats because roost-site lability was extremely high
   (70\% of sites occupied for only 1 night), bats did not cycle around a
   small number of preferred roosts, females carried their young to a new
   roost each day, and individuals abandoned each roost simultaneously as a
   group. Rates of reuse were low, with 301 new roost trees found >3 years
   of study. All sex and age classes switched frequently between solitary
   and communal roosts. Solitary roosts were occupied for longer times than
   colonial roosts. Reproductive females predominately (although not
   exclusively) used colonies during pregnancy and lactation but were more
   often solitary during post-lactation. Ratio of communal to solitary
   roosts in nonreproductive bats remained the same throughout summer, but
   adult males switched to communal roosts more often during
   post-lactation, presumably to mate. We suggest that suitable roosts were
   abundant allowing C. tuberculatus to move frequently in response to
   social and thermoregulatory requirements. If the pool of suitable trees
   were reduced, population viability may be affected.}},

Abstract = {{We used radiotelemetry to monitor movements of 35 juvenile snowshoe
   hares (Lepus americanus) from weaning until their first breeding season
   (June 1995 - April 1996). Juveniles born on control or food-addition
   areas were assigned to one of three cohorts of litters. We calculated
   natal dispersal distances (distance from nest site to breeding location)
   and frequencies of emigration (proportion dispersing more than twice the
   home-range diameter of adults) and determined ages and dates at
   emigration. Natal dispersal distances ranged from 23 m to >16 km. Fifty
   percent (9/18) of juveniles that survived until their first breeding
   season emigrated. Juveniles from the third litter dispersed at an older
   age than those from first or second litters. We detected no
   statistically significant effect of food addition on dispersal distance.
   With our small sample, we did not find statistical evidence of
   sex-biased natal dispersal (7 of 12 males and 2 of 6 females dispersed).}},

Abstract = {{To date, biofilters have been used primarily to control dilute, usually
   odorous, off-gases with relatively low volatile organic compound (VOC)
   concentrations (<1 g m(-3)) and VOC loads (<50 g m(-3) hr(-1)).
   Recently, however, U.S. industry has shown an interest in applying
   biofilters to higher concentrations of VOCs and hazardous air pollutants
   (HAPs).
   In this study, the behavior of biofilters under high loads of binary VOC
   mixtures was studied. Two bench scale biofilters were operated using a
   commercially available medium and a mixture of wood chips and compost.
   Both were exposed to varying mixtures of ethyl acetate and toluene.
   Concentration profiles and the corresponding removal efficiencies as a
   function of VOC loading were determined through frequent grab-sampling
   and GC analysis. Biofilter response to two frequently encountered
   operating problems-media dry-out and operating temperatures exceeding 40
   degrees C-was also evaluated under controlled conditions. Microbial
   populations were also monitored to confirm the presence of organisms
   capable of degrading both major off-gas constituents. The results
   demonstrated several characteristics of biofilters operating under high
   VOC load conditions.
   Maximum elimination capacities for ethyl acetate were typically in the
   range of 200 g m(-3) hr(-1).
   Despite the presence of toluene degraders, the removal of toluene was
   inhibited by high loads of ethyl acetate.
   Several byproducts, particularly ethanol, were formed.
   Short-term dry-out and temperature excursions resulted in reduced
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Asiatic wild asses, Equus hemionus, were driven to extinction in Israel
   in the early 20th century. In 1983, a herd of these animals was
   re-introduced to the wild in Makhtesh Ramon, a large erosion cirque in
   the central Negev desert, Israel. The population has grown steadily ever
   since and now numbers some 100 animals. In order to determine whether
   the wild asses are having a significant impact on the vegetation, we
   have monitored the plant communities in Makhtesh Ramon since 1992, using
   McAuliffe's log-series survey method. Our study involves 11 pairs of
   plots along the length of the altitudinal gradient in Makhtesh Ramon.
   The altitudinal gradient results in a rainfall gradient from an average
   of 95 mm rain per year to an average of about 40 mm per year. Each pair
   of plots consists of: (1) an unfenced plot, and (2) a fenced plot that
   excludes wild asses but not the other large mammalian herbivore, the
   dorcas gazelle Gazella dorcas. The wild asses have not had a significant
   impact on vegetation cover, species richness, diversity or dominance.
   Three plant species showed significant increases in percentage cover in
   fenced plots, while one species showed a significant increase in
   percentage cover in unfenced plots. Furthermore, eight plant species
   invaded fenced plots, three species invaded unfenced plots and one
   species disappeared from unfenced plots during the study. Using
   Detrended Correspondence Analysis, we found that the major differences
   among plots are due to position along the altitudinal gradient. The
   Detrended Correspondence Analyses indicated that the wild asses have had
   no significant effect on vegetation community structure.}},

Abstract = {{Activity patterns of greater horseshoe bats Rhinolophus ferrumequinum
   were investigated at caves in Cheddar (south-west England) during the
   hibernation season. An ultrasound detector and datalogger were used to
   monitor and record the number of echolocation calls in a single cave.
   Activity of R. ferrumequinum remained largely nocturnal throughout
   winter, and the mean time of activity over 24 h was 88 to 369 min after
   sunset. There was an increase in diurnal activity from late May to early
   June, probably because bats remained active after foraging at dawn
   towards the end of the hibernation season. Visits to the cave did not
   increase bat activity. Cave air temperature reflected external climatic
   temperature, although there was variation in cave temperature and its
   range within and among caves. Individual R. ferrumequinum are usually
   dispersed in caves in regions where temperature fluctuations correlate
   with climatic variations in temperature. There was a positive
   correlation between the number of daily bat passes monitored by the bat
   detector and datalogger (= daily activity) and cave temperature.
   Nocturnal activity may be sometimes associated with winter feeding.
   Neither date nor barometric pressure had a significant effect on daily
   activity. Activity patterns largely reflected the findings from
   individual R. ferrumequinum studied by telemetry (Park, 1998), in that
   bat activity increased with cave and climatic temperatures, and the
   temporal pattern of activity remained consistently nocturnal throughout
   winter, starting at dusk.}},

   physiognomy affect vole population dynamics. We present the results of a
   six-year survey of vole populations in the Jura mountains of eastern
   France (700-900 m elev.) which was conducted to determine whether patch
   array (i.e. spatial arrangement of different habitat patches) and vole
   demography are interconnected?
   The population kinetics of M. arvalis has been monitored in different
   habitats characterized by extensive homogenous and heterogeneous
   landscapes. We compare results from different parts of these landscapes
   to test the neighborhood effects of hedgerow networks, wood mosaics,
   forests, and villages. Analysis suggests that (1) refuge habitats for
   specialist predators act as destabilizing factors increasing both the
   amplitude of fluctuations and the duration of the high density phase,
   (2) refuge habitats for generalist predators act as regulating factors,
   dampening vole population kinetics and shortening the phase of peak
   numbers, (3) sink effects occur at forest edges and in the vicinity of
   villages, and (4) barrier effects are detected in grassland surrounded
   by forest. Such descriptive studies have implications for pest control
   strategies and provide a framework for further demographic field studies
   and natural experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of offshore placer gold mining on benthic invertebrates were
   assessed on `sand' and `cobble' substrates in Norton Sound, northeastern
   Bering Sea. Mining with a bucket-line dredge occurred nearshore in 9-20
   m during June to November 1986-90. Sampling nearly a year subsequent to
   mining demonstrated minor alteration of substrate granulometry with no
   clear trends. However, benthic macrofaunal community parameters (total
   abundance, biomass, diversity) and abundance of dominant families were
   significantly reduced ar mined stations. Many of the dominant taxa are
   known prey of the locally important red king crab (Paralithodes
   camtschaticus). Dominance of opportunistic species and small sizes at
   unmined and mined sites represents faunal responses to the natural
   dynamics of the region where establishment of populations of large,
   sexually-mature individuals is typically precluded. Multi-year
   bathymetric surveys of an area only mined in 1986 showed a continued
   smoothing of ocean bottom relief, decreasing size of tailing footprint,
   and shoaling of depressions left by mining. An ordination
   (multidimensional scaling) of taxon abundance data from mined (1 year
   after mining), recolonizing(2-7 years after mining) and unmined stations
   shows configurations that reflect disturbance. Recovery of the biota was
   underway in both substrates after 4 years, but this process was
   interrupted in the fall of the fourth year (1990) by several severe
   storms. Mining effects are contrasted with local natural disturbances.

Abstract = {{To in investigate the presence of sub-lethal contaminant effects in
   flounder (Platichthys flesus) populations in English estuaries, 16 sites
   from 7 estuaries were sampled in September-December 1997. Determination
   of hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity revealed that
   significant (p < 0.05) induction of the mixed function oxygenase (MFO)
   system was apparent in flounder from several industrialised estuaries
   compared to the relatively unpolluted reference site - the Aide estuary,
   The estuaries in increasing order of observed mean EROD activity were:
   Aide, Southampton Water, Humber, TS ne, Wear, Tees, Mersey, No
   significant gender differences in EROD induction or other measured
   variables were discovered for any site, Limited analytical data suggest
   a close link with EROD induction and hepatic polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH)/polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) concentrations but no
   strong correlations were discovered between EROD activity induction with
   any other measured variable across all estuaries. However, in the Tyne
   estuary strong negative correlations,were discovered bean een mean
   female EROD and female gonado-somatic index (GSI) and female condition
   factor (CF) of r = -0.84 and -0.80, respectively. It is suggested that
   the `out of season' correlation of reproductive parameters with EROD
   could be linked to contaminant interference, perhaps by xeno-oestrogens,
   It is clear that flounder populations in English industrialised
   estuaries are exhibiting widespread sub-lethal contaminant effects and
   more research is essential to understand the potential implications of
   this for reproduction and disease that could be affecting the future
   viability of these populations. Crown Copyright (C) 1999 Published by

Abstract = {{A targeted survey of vegetable production areas in Crete, Greece, showed
   that the majority of infestations of root-knot nematodes (RKN) were
   Meloidogyne javanica. M. incognita appeared to be limited to areas
   growing pepper that is a host for M. incognita but not for M. javanica.
   Tests with resistant tomato carrying the Mi gene showed that the M.
   incognita and the majority of the M, javanica populations were
   avirulent, and that virulent nematodes could not be selected from them.
   However, three populations of M. javanica, including some previously
   identified, were virulent. An AFLP study of the DNA from 22 populations
   of M. javanica produced 264 scorable amplification products and gave a
   very high mean similarity (99.4\%) between populations, indicating that
   both virulent and avirulent populations probably derived from the same
   founder population. Mi-resistant tomato and pepper appear to have
   considerable utility in the integrated management of RKN in Crete,
   provided care is taken to monitor the species and virulence or
   reproductive ability of the nematode populations.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the abundance, distribution, and habitat associations of the
   aquatic-foraging riparian-associated vertebrate community along four
   stream basins transecting managed forests in the Oregon Coast Range,
   1992-1994. The riparian-associated community we observed consisted
   primarily of birds with few observations of mammals. Belted kingfishers
   (Ceryle alcyon), American dippers (Cinclus mexicanus), great blue herons
   (Ardea herodias), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) comprised >85\% of
   these observations, but we observed only one group (greater than or
   equal to 1 individual observed together) from this community for each
   kilometer of stream surveyed. Bird abundances among years were not
   different tall P > 0.05). Species distribution was affected by stream
   order, stream basin, and season in each species, but to varying degrees.
   Belted kingfishers, common mergansers (Mergus merganser), great blue
   herons, green herons (Butorides striatus), and mallards were more
   abundant in larger, 6(th)-order streams than in smaller, 4(th)-order
   streams (P < 0.05). Dippers used step channel units disproportionally
   more and riffles disproportionately less than expected (P < 0.5).
   Similarly, kingfishers used fewer rimes and more pool channel units than
   was expected (P < 0.5). Key habitat components that were predictive of
   use were species specific. Most notably, the presence of a forested
   riparian area, streamside trees, and valley walls that constrain the
   stream were important predictors of use by the three most abundant
   species; dippers, kingfishers, and great blue herons. Monitoring
   programs to assess populations of these species in mountainous habitat
   must be sensitive to the potential effects of stream order, basin, and
   season and encompass a large spatial and temporal extent.}},

Abstract = {{Positive interspecific and intraspecific relationships between local
   abundance and regional occupancy have been widely documented. The former
   are essentially pervasive. These patterns have some potentially
   significant applied implications: (1) Biodiversity inventorying - there
   can be no simple and effective trade-off between the intensity and
   spatial extant of biodiversity inventorying, (2) Population monitoring -
   intraspecific, and to a more limited extent interspecific, population
   monitoring may be based on measures of occupancy, particularly where
   only crude indications of marked shifts in abundance are required, (3)
   Harvesting - harvesting of local populations may often result in a
   reduction in wider occupancy, but if local extinctions are caused by
   over-exploitation this may not generally result in a reduction in local
   abundance elsewhere in the range of a species. (4) Conservation species
   of conservation concern may face the double jeopardy of low abundance
   and small range size, but depending on the extent of a causal link
   between levels of abundance and occupancy it may be possible to cheat
   the abundance-occupancy relationship and maintain species at relatively
   high local densities for their range sizes, and (5) Invasions - pest
   species may become more of a problem in those areas in which they
   already occur, because their local densities will increase, as they
   spread.}},

Abstract = {{Insecticide sprays were applied to Myzus persicae (Sulzer) populations
   carrying various combinations of three insecticide resistance mechanisms
   (esterase-based metabolic resistance and two target site mechanisms,
   known as MACE and kdr), supported on host plants growing in field
   simulator cages. The study showed that MACE confers extreme resistance
   to pirimicarb and triazamate (carbamate insecticides) but not to
   deltamethrin + heptenophos (16 + 1) (Decisquick) or dimethoate (an
   organophosphorus insecticide). Resistance to dimethoate depends solely
   on levels of esterase-based resistance, while resistance to Decisquick
   depends on kdr and esterase. None of the four insecticides is effective
   against aphids carrying MACE combined with extreme esterase-based
   resistance. This knowledge, in association with current monitoring of
   the mechanisms, will play an important role in making decisions on
   insecticide use against M persicae in the UK. (C) 1999 Society of

   populations of the pathogen on tomato plants from just before planting
   to harvest. In a survey of transplant seedlings in greenhouses, P.
   syringae pv. tomato populations ranged from 8 x 10(0) to 3.2 x 10(5)
   CFU/g of leaf tissue. Copper-sprayed seedlings had similar populations
   to nonsprayed plants, but copper tolerance was common among the P.
   syringae pv. tomato strains surveyed. Transplant seedlings from three
   greenhouses were tagged, randomly planted in three grower fields, and
   monitored for P. syringae pv. tomato and disease severity over two
   growing seasons. Statistical analysis indicated that, when the P.
   syringae pv. tomato populations of greenhouse plants were small, as
   recorded in this study, there was no correlation between greenhouse
   infestation and disease severity in the field. Environmental conditions
   played a greater role than greenhouse infestation in disease
   development. Once formed, leaf lesions remained a good inoculum source
   (10(4) to 10(5) CFU) throughout the 7-week life of the leaf. Bacterial
   speck damage correlated well in both years (r = 0.80 and r = 0.86,
   respectively) with P. syringae pv. tomato population levels.}},

Abstract = {{Insect defoliation is a major disturbance force in forested ecosystems.
   Monitoring outbreaks, and estimating the areas affected, is therefore
   important for both forest managers and forest ecologists. The objective
   of our study teas to classify jack pine budworm defoliation levels in
   Landsat TM imagery recorded precious to and during the 1990-1995
   outbreak In our 450,000 ha study area in northwestern Wisconsin (USA).
   Many precious studies correlated insect defoliation and remotely sensed
   imagery with moderate to good success, but it often remained unclear if
   actual defoliation effects or other forest attributes correlated with
   defoliation were defected. For example, a larger deciduous component in
   mixed jack pine stands will limit budworm populations and thereby
   defoliation. The deciduous component in stands is a determining factor
   for insect defoliation, whereas needle discoloration and tree mortality
   are their effect. We used pre-outbreak Landsat TM data (1987) to
   identify determining factors for jack pine budworm population levels and
   peak-outbreak imagery (1993)for detecting actual defoliation. Our
   satellite data were atmospherically corrected using a radiative transfer
   model (5S). Spectral mixture analysis was performed using spectrometer
   measurements of jack pine needles and bark as representations of surface
   materials ({''}endmembers{''}), The explanatory power of the resulting
   fraction images was evaluated using jack pine budworm population data
   collected at 33 sampling points. Near-infrared reflectance (NIR)
   increased in defoliated stands between 1987 and 1993, but single date
   NIR in each year was negatively correlated with budworm levels in 1993
   (r= -0.69 and -0.47). This was because hardwood trees within jack pine
   stands caused higher NIR reflectance but limited jack pine budworm
   populations. The 10\% NIR difference between pure and mixed jack pine
   stands outweighed the 3-5\% increase in NIR due to defoliation and
   necessitated stratification of the satellite data by tree species.
   Spectral mixture analysis performed on pure jack pine stands resulted in
   a strong negative correlation between the 1993 green needle fraction and
   the 1993 budworm population data (r=-0.94). This study was, to our
   knowledge, the first that applied spectral mixture analysis for forest
   damage detection, and also the first to use insect population
   measurements as independent field data. These methods and the separation
   of determinants and effects of jack pine budworm defoliation, enabled us
   to detect actual defoliation with high accuracy. (C) Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Passerines that are exposed to brood parasitism can evolve reduced
   intraclutch variation in egg appearance to facilitate recognition and
   rejection of the parasitic egg. This has been shown to be true for
   European passerine species that are assumed to have participated in an
   evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). However, few
   investigations have been carried out with the aim of finding out whether
   there is a relationship between these two traits within a species. In
   this study, we compare the level of intraclutch variation in eg-p
   appearance and the rejection of an unlike parasitic egg within a
   population of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) in the
   south-eastern part of the Czech Republic. We parasitized reed warbler
   nests with an artificial non-mimetic cuckoo egg, and then monitored the
   reaction of the hosts. In 27 out of 48 nests (56.3\%) the parasitic egg
   was rejected. The rejecter pairs had a statistically significantly lower
   intraclutch variation in egg appearance than the acceptor pairs. We
   discuss possible explanations for the observed relationship between
   rejection of unlike eggs and intraclutch variation in egg appearance
   within this population of reed warblers. The results are consistent with
   the evolutionary arms race hypothesis, but the intermediate rejection
   rate found in this population could also be maintained by an equilibrium
   between accepters and rejecters due to rejection costs.}},

Abstract = {{The direct effects of viral enrichments upon natural populations of
   marine viruses and bacteria were studied in seawater from Santa Monica
   Bay, CA, USA. Active virus concentrates, or control additions
   (ultrafiltered seawater or autoclaved virus concentrate) were added to 2
   l incubations of protist-free seawater, and the effects were monitored
   for about 3 d. At the beginning of the experiments, the virus numbers
   reflected the expected addition of intact virus particles as determined
   by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Subsequently, the mean
   frequency of visibly infected bacteria (FVIB; \% bacteria which were
   visibly infected with 5 or more virus-like particles) was greater in the
   enriched incubations than in the controls. In controls, the estimated
   percent of bacteria that were infected remained constant at about 5 to
   10\% of the total bacterial population, but with active enrichment, 10
   to 35 \% of the total bacterial population was infected at a given time.
   Therefore, by increasing the concentration of active viruses in seawater
   incubations we were able to increase the amount of bacterial mortality
   attributed to virus infection. Even with the presumed increase in
   bacterial mortality, the net increases in bacterial abundance in the
   samples that were enriched with active virus concentrate were higher
   than those seen in the controls. The viral abundance in bottles that
   were enriched with the active virus concentrate was significantly higher
   than that in the controls in Expts 2 and 3 (p < 0.05), but by the end of
   the experiments, viral abundances in the enriched incubations approached
   control levels. In Expts 1 and 2, rates of DOP hydrolysis were higher in
   the samples enriched with the active virus concentrate, and may have
   been due to an increase in the incidence of viral lysis. However,
   overall analysis of DCAA, DFAA, and DOP hydrolysis were quite variable
   and difficult to interpret. Results indicate that viral enrichment
   increased the incidence of bacterial infection and consequently
   stimulated the growth of subpopulations of non-infected heterotrophic
   bacterioplankton.}},

Abstract = {{As part of mesocosm experiments to study effects of nutrients and
   zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton communities from the northern
   Adriatic Sea, we monitored metazoan zooplankton fluctuations in
   enclosures and performed grazing experiments in May and June of 1993. An
   effort was made to increase zooplankton abundances up to 10 times above
   normal levels in May, whereas in June, we attempted to initially exclude
   zooplankters >100 mu m in size. Neither manipulation mattered since, in
   both cases, a cohort of copepodites rapidly developed from eggs and
   nauplii added during initial Wing of enclosures. Declines in abundances
   of nauplii, with concurrent increases in copepodites, during both
   experiments likely resulted from a combination of nauplii molting into
   copepodites, and possibly cannibalism of nauplii by copepodites and
   adults, in May copepodites were almost exclusively Acartia clausi,
   whereas in June, both A. clausi and particularly Oithona similis
   copepodites increased in enclosures after 6 to 7 d. Grazing rates by A.
   clausi adults and copepodites were low in both months (0.01 to 0.35 ml
   copepod(-1) h(-1) in May, and <0.21 ml copepod(-1) h(-1) in June).
   Zooplankton community grazing had minimal impact, in that phytoplankton
   growth continued unabated until nutrients were exhausted.}},

   grazing-vegetation interactions. The Quaternary glaciations and recent
   anthropogenic influences have contributed to the loss of European
   mega-herbivores. The geological record from the Eemian interglacial in
   Denmark suggests that presence of elephant and rhinoceros did not create
   widespread openings in forest cover. Large populations of giant deer in
   ireland became extinct 11 000 years ago. We propose a theory that the
   giant deer were sufficiently abundant to convert juniper scrub
   communities into open grassland at a regional scale. The balance between
   grazers and browsers has undergone continuous change during the last 10
   000 yeats with significant consequences for forest composition and
   structure. Hunting statistics and archival records permit crude
   reconstructions of population dynamics for certain ungulate species.
   High resolution pollen analysis and long-term monitoring generate
   reconstructions of vegetation that can be compared with fluctuating
   grazing pressure during the last few hundred years. Such data can be
   used to validate simulation models of,grazing-vegetation interactions.

Abstract = {{While tropical forest loss is recognized as a global problem, little is
   known on a local scale about the complex relationships between
   environmental, economic, social and policy factors that induce changes
   in land use patterns. This study analyzes the process of human-induced
   landscape transformation in a small watershed in the central region of
   Honduras in 1955, 1975 and 1995. The watershed comprises a small
   mountainous valley with steep slopes and a small plain, typical of the
   landscape pattern in Central America. The spatial and temporal change
   patterns of land use were quantified by interpreting aerial photographs
   and using a Geographic Information System. During the last 40 years,
   forest cover has been reduced drastically with increasing population
   pressure and agricultural activities. The traditional expansive shifting
   cultivation system has passed through a process of agricultural
   intensification and crop diversification which removed the restraints in
   territorial needs for the increasing local population. Limiting physical
   and ecological factors were assessed, as well as the socio-economic and
   policy forces that caused these changes in natural resource management
   practices and the resulting land use patterns. The study showed that
   monitoring systems are a necessary instrument required to assess and
   evaluate local impacts of national policies. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Litter decomposition plays a major role in the cycling of energy and
   nutrients in woodland ecosystems. The rates of leaf litter decomposition
   and the resulting nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) release were
   monitored over a 12-month period for Eucalyptus brookerana and two types
   of E botryoides leaf litter under one population density trial of
   eucalypt short rotation forests. The results showed that the tree
   density had Little influence on the rates of litter decomposition and
   nitrogen release, but had a significant effect on phosphorus release.
   The higher the population density, the slower the release. The total
   nitrogen and phosphorus retention in the Litter increased at first,
   particularly for phosphorus under the highest tree density (9803 trees
   ha(-1)). There were significant differences between the rates of both
   litter decomposition and nutrient release among the three studied leaf
   litter types. Litter dry weight loss and nutrient release were faster
   from E. brookerana litter than from E. botryoides litter. Autumn was the
   main season for litter decomposition and nutrient release. Overall,
   short rotation forests should be managed rationally based on the
   fluctuation of litter decomposition, and nutrient cycling in the system
   to ensure a sustainable production system of land use. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We examined the spatial genetic structure of Helianthus occidentalis
   Riddell ssp. occidentalis Riddell (western sunflower) to determine
   whether this species is highly clonal and whether the distance between
   prairie patches influences genetic differentiation. Tn the Edge of
   Appalachia Preserve System, Ohio, this species is restricted to prairie
   patches that have a clumped distribution in the forest matrix. Data from
   this insect-pollinated forb with gravity-dispersed seed were compared to
   data from the same patches for Asclepias verticillata, an
   insect-pollinated species with wind-dispersed seed. Allozyme
   electrophoresis was used to collect genetic data from H. occidentalis
   samples from eight patches in four regions. Genetic data from three
   polymorphic loci indicted that this species is not highly clonal.
   Genetic differentiation was greater among patches within a region than
   among regions, suggesting that gene how among patches is more limited in
   H. occidentalis than in A. verticillata. Founder effect may also have
   contributed to observed genetic differences among parches as some of
   these populations may have re-established after release from human use.
   As habitat fragmentation is increasing in the preserve, it is also
   likely that genetic differentiation may be increasing. Therefore,
   monitoring of genetic structure is necessary to further assess the
   effect of fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{This essay explains the role of reproductive science, including what are
   termed reproductive technologies (i.e. artificial insemination, in vitro
   fertilization, embryo transfer, cloning), in conservation biology.
   Reproductive techniques (high- and low-tech) find their greatest
   application in understanding species uniqueness, adaptations and
   physiological mechanisms, not in the large-scale assisted breeding and
   the production of offspring. Models of how to use these tools to study
   reproductive fitness are emerging to help insure gene diversity and even
   propagate endangered species, but only after fundamental databases have
   been developed. Examples are provided of how non-invasive hormone
   metabolite monitoring, artificial insemination and genome resource
   banking are being used ex situ and in situ to understand wildlife
   biology. We predict that as the fundamental, multi-species database
   grows, so will the applied benefits for: (1) developing genome banks for
   insuring extant genetic diversity; (2) assessing the relationship of
   physiology, behaviour and environmental perturbations; (3) managing
   small populations; and (4) dealing with dilemmas ranging from
   contraception to skewed sex ratios to animal welfare. Most progress will
   be made in using these tools in systematic studies to solve the mystery
   of how thousands of unstudied species reproduce. Carried out
   appropriately, financial costs will be consistent with any approach for
   generating sound scientific knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{The population of elephant (Elephas maximus) in Block I of Ruhuna
   National Park, Sri Lanka was monitored through visual observations
   between 1960 and 1991. This represents perhaps the longest study of
   monitoring a single population of elephants in the world. Elephants were
   observed opportunistically for 23 years during the study period. In 166
   days, a total of 579 observations were made during which 2246 sightings
   of elephants were recorded. There were 354 bull groupings and 225 family
   units or herds. The adults (males and females) make up 65\% of the
   population. In general the proportions of the adult tuskers, makhnas
   (tuskless males), adult females, subadults and young have not changed
   much over the study period. But the proportion of tuskers among adult
   bulls shows wide fluctuation. Tuskers make up about 9.1\% of the bulls
   in the park. The observed adult male:adult female ratio is 1:1.86.
   Almost all the solitary animals that were observed were males. Solitary
   bulls were encountered throughout each year, but their numbers reached a
   peak following the rains. The largest bull group consisted of seven
   animals. The most frequently encountered herd consisted of 3-10 animals.
   About 80\% of the herds showed no association with adult males. The
   diurnal activity patterns of the bull groups and family units were
   largely similar but the bull groups were slightly more active in the
   mornings compared to the family units. The herds may be less tolerant of
   vehicles and people than the males and hence shift their activity
   towards the late evening hours. Although breeding may go on throughout
   the year, the calving intensity was found to vary. 85\% of the young
   were seen during the rainy season. Despite its small size (140 km(2)),
   Block I of Ruhuna National Park is one of the best areas that support
   viable elephant populations. This shows that in poor countries, simple
   measures such as protection and monitoring of elephants are easier,
   cheaper, and more likely to be successful than high-tech methods such as
   translocations or reintroductions which are difficult, expensive and
   likely to fail. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ten experimental management regimes, designed to quantify benefits to
   weed control and wildlife conservation on uncropped held edges of
   expanded width, were examined for effects on the weed flora within
   adjacent arable crops. The treatments involved cutting, sowing and
   herbicide regimes, with differing effects on plant and invertebrate
   populations. The relative abundance of all plant species within the
   adjacent crop edge was monitored using permanent quadrats between 1987
   and 1991. The field edge management regimes affected neither the total
   relative plant abundance, nor the relative abundance of most common
   species, within the adjacent crop edge. While frequencies of Avena spp
   were initially greatest adjacent to margins cut in spring and autumn,
   this effect was lost through time, and the greater abundance of Phleum
   pratense and Leucanthemum vulgare adjacent to the field edges in which
   they had been sown presented no threat to good husbandry. The management
   of uncropped arable field edges to enhance biodiversity is very unlikely
   to affect weed levels within the crop, especially where they contain, or
   are sown with, non-invasive perennial species. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Translocations have been widely used to conserve threatened fauna
   worldwide, and although the benefits of monitoring newly translocated
   animals are widely recognised, post-release monitoring seldom occurs.
   This paper reports the dispersal patterns, social organisation and
   survival of a newly translocated population of 26 South Island
   saddlebacks (Philesturunus carunculatus carunculatus), on Motuara
   Island, New Zealand. South Island saddlebacks dispersed widely through
   forest on Motuara Island after release and 8-10 months after release,
   territory sizes ranged from 1.9-8.8 ha ((x) over bar = 4.21 ha, s =
   2.42). Saddlebacks in both subadult and adult plumage attempted to breed
   in the first breeding season after release and an estimated 10
   fledglings were produced. Maximum mortality of the translocated group
   was 50\% 8-10 months after release. Translocations of 15-59 South Island
   saddlebacks have been successful in the past, suggesting the success of
   the transfer to Motuara Island is not jeopardised by the relatively
   small size of the founder group. Saddlebacks appear relatively flexible
   in habitat requirements and are capable of high reproductive output,
   enhancing the success of translocations of this species. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{We conducted a field experiment to determine the extent to which
   interference among generalist predators Limits their effectiveness as
   biocontrol agents. We manipulated immigration of a guild of actively
   hunting generalist ground predators, carabid beetles and lycosid
   spiders, by intercepting them as they attempted to enter fenced 50-m(2)
   vegetable gardens, Immigration was blocked, allowed at the mean rate
   measured at our field site, or doubled, Altered immigration rates were
   maintained through a spring garden of cabbage, bean, eggplant, and
   cucumber, followed by a summer garden of squash. We monitored densities
   of carabids and lycosids to discover if altering their immigration rate
   changed their densities in the plots. We also measured densities of
   other predators on the ground and in plant foliage, pest numbers, and
   vegetable yields. Doubling the immigration rate of carabids and lycosids
   approximately doubled the densities of carabids inside the plots, but
   did not increase lycosid densities. Increasing the rate of immigration
   of carabids and lycosids depressed densities of nonlycosid ground
   spiders. In the spring gardens, manipulation of carabid and lycosid
   immigration did not influence numbers of predators or herbivores in the
   foliage and did not affect vegetable productivity. In contrast, in the
   summer gardens, foliage-dwelling predators were lower, pest densities
   were marginally lower, and squash productivity was higher in the carabid
   and lycosid immigration plots compared to the no-immigration treatment,
   Doubling carabid and lycosid immigration rate never increased the
   magnitude of their effects on other predators, pests, or plant
   productivity. Predator interference limited lycosid establishment,
   reduced densities of other predator taxa, and apparently prevented a
   doubling of carabid densities from having an increased impact on pest
   numbers. Nevertheless, despite widespread effects of predator
   interference, allowing immigration of lycosids and carabids increased
   squash productivity. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring cruises were carried out on four coastal transects of the
   southern Adriatic Sea over two years to investigate the effects of the
   hydrodynamic regime on environmental factors and phytoplankton species
   composition and succession. The concentration of nutrient salts is
   usually low except for the winter months. Biomass levels tin terms of
   chlorophyll a) proved to be very low, with values ranging between 0.05
   and 1.25 mu g Chl a L(-1). Phytoplankton densities showed specific
   oligotrophic water values and varied in a wide range from 9 x 10(3) to
   2.9 x 10(6) cells L(-1); the maximum values were reached in
   January-February mainly because of a bloom of the diatom Skeletonema
   costatum. Diatoms were present throughout the year and represented the
   majority of the population (44.3\%) together with phytoflagellates
   (39.6\%), while dinoflagellates and coccolithophorids reached,
   respectively, 10.3 \% and 5.8 \%. During the year, diatoms were dominant
   with high cell densities in winter time, while phytoflagellates had a
   larger distribution over time and reached the highest Values in spring
   and summer. Species diversity values were typical of temperate coastal
   areas (H(') = 2.79 +/- 0.73).
   The type of circulation determined the distribution of thermohaline
   characteristics, abundance and biomass, as well as species composition
   and succession of phytoplankton in time. However, no great spatial
   variations were observed.}},

Abstract = {{Development of resistance to organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides
   by the Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), has caused great
   concern regarding the sustainability of peach production in Ontario,
   Canada. Thus, a resistance management program was implemented and a
   procedure was developed to monitor for resistance to insecticides in
   adult moths. Diagnostic concentrations needed to distinguish susceptible
   genotypes from resistant individuals were determined to be carbofuran
   (0.1 mu g per vial), carbaryl (1.0 mu g per vial), malathion (0.5 mu g
   per vial), and cypermethrin (2.5 mu g per vial). Significant survival of
   field-collected moths to diagnostic concentrations of cypermethrin
   suggested that resistance to pyrethroids might be widespread. The
   seasonal patterns of resistance of several Oriental fruit moth
   populations from the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario indicated a decrease
   in frequencies of resistance to all insecticides tested from 1996
   through 1998. Resistance levels were unstable, thus suggesting that
   resistance could be successfully managed. Our data confirmed the
   usefulness of the vial test to monitor for resistance to insecticides in
   the adult Oriental fruit moth, and provided the basis for the
   development of a resistance management strategy designed to extend the
   efficacy of all classes of insecticides used for control.}},

Abstract = {{Pitfall and screen traps were used around potato Solanum tuberosum L.
   (Solanaceae) plots to detect directional patterns of prediapause (two
   seasons) and postdiapause (one season) movement in a univoltine
   population of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata
   (Say), from Quebec. Prediapause beetles were sampled for diapause
   readiness using a feeding-digging test. In 1994, a plot left unprotected
   from the beetle (moderately defoliated) was monitored. In 1995, movement
   around a plot left unprotected from the beetle (severely defoliated) was
   compared to that from a plot protected (only lightly defoliated) by
   inundative release of the potato beetle predator Perillus bioculatus Say
   (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Movement frequency by postdiapause beetles in
   spring 1995 was low compared with 1994 pre diapause movement, especially
   on the ground. Low-frequency flying persisted over several weeks of
   postdiapause beetle oviposition, with only a brief period of
   directionality. Flight movement by satiated prediapause beetles in
   August 1994 and 1995 was strongly directional, being oriented toward the
   closest forest border east of the plots, where sampling confirmed
   overwintering. In both years, satiated prediapause beetles also
   emigrated by walking, but mostly from densely populated and defoliated
   plots. Newly emerged (unsatiated) prediapause beetles emigrated en masse
   from severely defoliated plants, and did so exclusively by walking.
   Directional walking contrasted with directional flying in being
   predominantly oriented southwestward to northwestward, suggesting cueing
   on the sun position during warm hours of the day.}},

Abstract = {{Following extirpation by DDT in the 1960s, a cliff-nesting population of
   Peregrine Falcons was reestablished in northern New York and New

   16\% with average productivity of 1.29 fledglings/territorial pair and
   nest success of 73\%. Geographical variability in reproductive success
   was prevalent within the region. Lower reproductive performance in the
   White Mountain subpopulation in particular, was not related to density
   dependent or weather factors, but was significantly correlated to a
   lower percentage of doves (Rock + Mourning) in the diet. In addition to
   providing a large amount of biomass per unit catch effort, low
   trophic-level granivorous doves accumulate lower contaminant levels than
   insectivorous prey species. Because doves are primarily associated with
   agricultural habitats, geographic variability in reproductive
   performance within this region may ultimately be related to habitat
   differences.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal patterns of colonization of roots of perennials by arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi are poorly understood because annual crops are more
   often studied. The objective was to monitor in detail the growth and
   mycorrhizae of the perennial American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.)
   over the first 2 years after seeding. In particular, the extent of
   carry-over of colonization into the second year was examined. Delayed
   germination of some seeds caused by chance-driven variability in the
   time needed for seed maturation after seed collection provided an
   opportunity to compare first- and second-year plants under identical
   conditions in the second year. For all plants, development of arbuscules
   rose to a maximum in mid-August, falling partially thereafter.
   Production of hyphal coils proceeded more slowly but steadily, so that
   end-of-season colonization was composed equally of arbuscules and hyphal
   coils. Between seasons, taproot dry mass was reduced by 18\%, whereas
   lateral root length increased by 15\%. These changes were probably
   caused by root turnover, which left little initial colonization of roots
   at the start of the second year. Strikingly, second-year plants did not
   exhibit a colonization lag phase, whereas a lag of 43 days was seen for
   the first-year plants alongside. Possible reasons for this difference
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{During a 5-year period (1993-1997), the release of Uncinula necator
   (Schweiniz) Burrill ascospores was monitored under natural conditions in
   the Bordeaux region. Ascospore release always began after bud burst and
   generally ended before blossoming. The release periods of ascospores
   were always associated with a rainfall higher than 2 mm, a wetting
   duration greater than 2.5 h, an average temperature generally above 11 C
   and a daily mean temperature sum from November 1 to the first ascospore
   release above 1100 C. There was no relation between earliness, number of
   ascospores released, and disease severity on grapes (Vitis vinifera L.
   cv. Merlot). The primary infection did not appear to be important for
   the increase of the powdery mildew population; on the other hand, the
   weather conditions of April (rainfall and temperature) seemed to
   strongly influence disease severity on berries by enabling good growth
   of the pathogen on leaves. These findings could be used to determine the
   optimal dates of the first fungicide treatments for powdery mildew
   according to the weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The frequent lack of correspondence between measured population stage
   structures and those predicted from demographic models has usually been
   seen as an embarrassment, resulting from poor data, or a testimony to
   the failings of overly simplistic models. However, such mismatches can
   also arise due to natural or anthropogenic changes in the: environment,
   thus providing the data needed to test hypotheses about the ecological
   effects of local or global environmental change. Here, we present a
   method that allows this type of comparison to rigorously test for the
   population-level effects of past and ongoing environmental change in
   situations where no long-term monitoring data exist. Our approach hinges
   on the fact that changing environmental conditions will cause population
   size structure to lag behind that predicted by current demographic
   rates. We first develop the methods needed to calculate the likelihood
   of an observed population structure, given different stochastic models
   of demography responding to environmental changes. We next use simulated
   data to explore the method's power in the face of estimation errors in
   current vital rates, environmental noise, and other complications. We
   conclude that this method holds promise when applied to slowly growing,
   long-lived species and when model structures are used that allow for
   realistic time lags in population structure. Researchers using this
   approach should also be careful to assess the importance of other
   phenomena (rare catastrophes, recent founding of populations, genetic
   changes, and density dependence) that may compromise the method's
   accuracy. Although large data sets are required for the method to be
   accurate and powerful, the data required will be readily obtainable for
   abundant and easily sampled species. While most ecological efforts to
   detect global environmental changes have focused on long-term
   monitoring, or indicators such as tree rings that are unique to
   organisms not present in all biomes, this method allows tests for past
   and ongoing changes in situations where neither past monitoring data nor
   unique indicator species are available.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that the El Nifio Southern Oscillation
   influences forest-wide fruit production, which, in turn, limits
   frugivorous and granivorous mammals on Barro Colorado Island (BCI)I
   Panama. Observations of BCI mammals have been compiled for 49 years.
   Frugivorous mammals experienced famine between September and January in
   1931-1932, 1958-1959, 1970-1971, and 1993-1994. The most recent famine
   is evident from an 11-yr record of natural deaths of mammals and a 2-yr
   record of population densities. Famine occurred every time a mild dry
   season followed an El Nino event in the 49-yr record. This coincidence
   is statistically improbable, as demonstrated by a randomization test.
   A 2-yr cycle of high, then low community-level fruit production has been
   observed twice for BCI when a mild dry season followed an El Nino event.
   We used 260 litter traps to monitor community- and species-level fruit
   production from 1 January 1987 through 30 June 1996. Community-level
   fruit production was greatest during the 1992 El Nino event and lowest
   one year later, after the mild 1993 dry season. We also reinterpret an
   earlier 2-yr record of fruit production in light of our 9.5-yr record of
   fruit production. Community-level fruit production was elevated during
   the 1969 El Nino event and was very low one year later, after the mild
   1970 dry season. We hypothesize that (1) El Nino conditions enhance
   fruit production: (2) high fruit production consumes stored reserves,
   limiting the next reproductive event; and (3) mild dry seasons reduce
   fruit production. Each plant species may respond to any combination of
   the three components of this hypothesis. Community-level fruit
   production is extremely low when species sensitive to components 1 and 2
   are entrained with species sensitive to component 3, or when a mild dry
   season follows one year after an El Nino event.
   El Nino events bring dry, sunny conditions to BCI and a large portion of
   the wet tropics, Drought and sun may both favor fruit production in wet
   tropical forests, Drought is known to synchronize flowering, and sunny
   conditions may relieve light limitation. The El Nine Southern
   Oscillation has a strong 24-mo periodicity. This creates a strong
   tendency for dry, sunny years to alternate with wet, cloudy years in
   Central America and elsewhere in the tropics. We present evidence that
   this alternately enhances and reduces fruit production on BCI.
   Terborgh hypothesized that predators regulate frugivorous mammals in
   tropical forests. As a corollary, he further hypothesized that famines
   occur on BCI because several large predators are absent and frugivores
   escape predation. We extended censuses to the nearby mainland to
   evaluate this hypothesis. Poachers, who are active on the mainland,
   reduce the abundances of game species below levels maintained in the
   presence of large felids and raptors. There was evidence for famine in
   poached, mainland populations, and we rejected the hypothesis that
   reduced predation pressure is a prerequisite for famine.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that habitat corridors enhance exchange of
   individuals (transfer) and interbreeding between otherwise isolated
   demes in fragmented populations. However, due to the paucity of
   experimental studies this proposition has become controversial. We
   tested these proposed effects of corridors in 12 experimentally
   fragmented root vole populations. A 50-m long habitat corridor connected
   two large habitat patches in each of six treatment populations, while
   equivalent habitat patches in six control populations had no corridor
   connection. Each of the two patches in each population was initially
   colonized by founder demes that were monomorphic with respect to two
   different marker alleles of a single locus. The rate of transfer of
   individuals and the resultant degree of interbreeding (heterozygosity)
   between the two demes were monitored by capture-recapture methodology
   and genetic analyses over the reproductive season.
   Females were predominantly philopatric in these populations; more than
   four-fifths of the founder deme females settled and reproduced in their
   original patch. However, corridors significantly facilitated the
   transfer of females. The transfer rate of males was generally very high;
   approximately four-fifths, independent of the experimental factor
   (absence or presence of corridors). The sex-specific transfer pattern
   gave rise to very high rates of interbreeding (heterozygosity). The rare
   of interbreeding was enhanced by the presence of corridors, and more so
   than expected from the transfer rate. The lack of concordance between
   expected and observed heterozygosity in the corridor populations was
   probably due to short-term mating excursions facilitated by the presence
   of corridors.}},

Abstract = {{The study evaluated contamination of fish by mercury in two important
   Czech water reservoirs, Orlik and Kamyk, which receive water from the
   whole watershed of Otava and Vltava rivers. Contamination of these
   reservoirs reflects the situation in southern and western Bohemia. Six
   environmentally representative sites were sampled in the area of
   interest and the evaluation was based on regression models relating Hg
   concentrations in fish tissues to the age of fish. A total number of 170
   analyzed individuals from 3 indicative species (Rutilus rutilus, Abramis
   brama, and Perca fluviatilis) allowed site-specific analyses of model
   residuals. The results of biological monitoring corresponded to the
   sediment analyses and suggested that Orlik reservoir receives a
   substantial part of the pollution from the VItava river. Temporary
   oxygen deficiency and decreased value of pH were probably the key
   factors responsible for the increased exposure of fish to Hg in the
   Kamyk reservoir. An additional comparison of 286 analyzed individuals
   belonging to 11 fish species provided the following decreasing order for
   muscle contamination: typical predators < benthophagous species with
   substantial portion of fish in food < typical benthophagous species <
   planktonophagous species. Comparing the tissues, Hg appeared to be
   preferentially accumulated in muscle and less in liver and rather

Abstract = {{Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), a measure of developmental stability, has
   been suggested as a monitoring tool for environmental pollution.
   However, there have been few investigations into the effects of short
   term pollution on the level of FA. This paper explores effects of
   exposing late instar larvae to short term pollution on the level of FA
   in the wings of adult damselflies. In these insects FA in wing length
   and in cell patterns have different `windows of opportunity' in relation
   to environmental stress. If increased environmental stress is applied
   after the `window of opportunity' of one trait had closed, while the
   window of the other trait was still open then the level of FA of the
   first trait should not be altered whereas that of the latter should
   increase. If short term pollution killed part of a population,
   symmetrical individuals (low FA) should survive better than highly
   asymmetrical ones, because FA reflects the overall ability of an
   individual to cope with stress. If the pollution event occurred at a
   time when the level of FA was already fixed, the level of FA of the
   remaining population should be lower than that in controls. An
   experiment was carried out, using 10 artificial ponds, each holding a
   population of larvae of the damselfly Xanthocnemis zealandica
   (McLachlan). Damselfly larvae were exposed to carbaryl at a nominal
   concentration of 100 mu g l(-1), which reduced emergence success after
   10-20 days by ca. 50\%. Based on laboratory experiments, it was assumed
   that despite the high mortality, the short exposure to carbaryl late in
   the last instar would ensure that the wing cell patterns of the
   damselflies were not altered by the increased stress. The level of FA in
   wing length increased in the damselflies surviving the exposure to
   carbaryl but the level of FA in cell patterns did not differ
   significantly between the treatment and the control. The effects of
   differential mortality, as well as the effects of pollution, on the
   level of FA in traits with different `windows of opportunity' need
   further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Benzene, an important component in gasoline, is a widely distributed
   environmental contaminant that has been linked to known health effects
   in animals and humans, including leukemia. In Mexico City, environmental
   benzene levels, which may be elevated because of the heavy traffic and
   the poor emission control devices of older vehicles, may pose a health
   risk to the population. To assess the potential risk, portable passive
   monitors and blood concentrations were used to survey three different
   occupational groups in Mexico City. Passive monitors measured the
   personal exposure of 45 workers to benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene,
   o-xylene and m-/p-xylene during a work shift. Blood concentrations of
   the above volatile organic compounds (VOCs), methyl tert-butyl ether,
   and styrene were measured at the beginning and the end of a work shift.
   Passive monitors showed significantly higher (p > 0.0001) benzene
   exposure levels among service station attendants (median = 330 mu
   g/m(3); range 130-770) as compared to street vendors (median = 62 mu
   g/m(3); range 49-180) and office workers (median = 44 mu g/m(3), range
   32-67). Baseline blood benzene levels (BBLs) for these groups were
   higher than those reported for similar populations from Western
   countries (median = 0.63 mu g/L, n = 24 for service station attendants;
   median = 0.30 mu g/L, n = 6 for street vendors; and median = 0.17 mu
   g/L, n = 7 for office workers). Nonsmoking office workers who were
   nonoccupationally exposed to VOCs had BBLs that were more than five
   times higher than those observed in a nonsmoking U.S. population. BBLs
   of participants did not increase during the work shift, suggesting that
   because the participants were chronically exposed to benzene, complex
   pharmacokinetic mechanisms were involved. Our results highlight the need
   for more complete studies to assess the potential benefits of setting
   environmental standards for benzene and other VOCs in Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon monoxide, a gas originating from incomplete combustion of
   carbon-based fuels, is an important cause of human deaths. In this
   paper, we describe an unusual carbon monoxide poisoning in a dwelling
   without obvious sources of combustion gases, for which two adults had to
   be treated in a hyperbaric chamber. Carbon monoxide readings were taken
   in the house and in the neighboring homes. Methane gas and nitrogen
   oxide levels were also monitored in the house air. Soil samples were
   collected around the house and tested for hydrocarbon residues. The
   investigation revealed the presence of a pocket of carbon monoxide under
   the foundation of the house. The first readings revealed carbon monoxide
   levels of 500 ppm in the basement. The contamination lasted for a week.
   The investigation indicated that the probable source of contamination
   was the use of explosives at a nearby rain sewer construction site. The
   use of explosives in a residential area can constitute a major source of
   carbon monoxide for the neighboring populations. This must be
   investigated, and public health authorities, primary-care physicians,
   governmental authorities, and users and manufacturers of explosives must
   be made aware of this problem.}},

Abstract = {{Although considerable attention is devoted to environmental monitoring
   and assessment with respect to both pollutants and the status of
   particular plant or animal populations, less attention is devoted to
   assessing people's attitudes about the relative importance of ecological
   resources. In this paper we examine the attitudes and perceptions about
   ecological resources of people living around the Department of Energy's
   Savannah River Site (SRS), in South Carolina. Our overall hypothesis is
   that people who are directly affected by the possible outcomes and
   consequences of a particular hazard (i.e., those people employed at SRS)
   will undervalue the risks and overvalue the potential benefits from
   future land uses that favor continued site activity, compared to people
   who live near but are not employed at SRS. We interviewed 286 people
   attending the Aiken Trials horse show on 14 March 1997. There were few
   gender differences, although men hunted and fished more than women,
   women ranked three environmental concerns as more severe than did men,
   and women were more concerned about the effect of SRS on property
   values. Maintenance of SRS as a National Environmental Research Park
   ranked first as a future land use; nuclear production ranked second,
   followed by hunting and hiking. Only residential development ranked very
   low as a future land use. There were many differences as a function of
   employment history at SRS: 1) people who work at SRS think that the
   federal government should spend funds to clean up all nuclear
   facilities, and they think less money should be spent on other
   environmental problems than did non-employees, 2) people who work at SRS
   ranked continued current uses of SRS higher than did people who never
   worked at SRS, and 3) people who work at SRS are less concerned about
   the storage of nuclear material or accidents at the site than are people
   who never worked at the site.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate analyses of a large set of physical, chemical, and
   biological measurements indicated possible effects that specific surface
   water properties have on biotransformation rates of pesticides. In this
   study, we investigated the roles of Mg, Mn, and P, which were identified
   as relevant, discriminating environmental variables in the overall
   biotransformation process as it occurred under nitrifying conditions.
   Nematicide aldicarb, herbicides simazine and MCPA were selected as their
   chemical group representatives. Series of mechanically aerated
   incubation vessels were set up to test nutrient enrichment effects on
   microbial development and subsequent pesticide transformation.
   Accounting for alterations in system conditions, relevant
   (physico)chemical characteristics were monitored. An increase in total
   microbial population was observed in surface water samples in the
   presence of both aldicarb and simazine. No increase was observed when
   MCPA was added, which was probably cometabolized. Large phosphorus
   concentrations not only favored bacterial growth, but also increased the
   residence time of dissolved Mn which under certain conditions promoted
   biotransformation. Furthermore, PO4 enrichment decreases aldicarb's
   aerobic metabolites' concentrations. Simazine was persistent over a
   period of at least 80 days, except for a short period coinciding with
   the nitrification period in which NH4+ dissipates and NO2 and NO3- are
   formed. Selective bacterial growth was observed on simazine's
   transformation product DES. Relationships of Mg/Mn concentrations to
   MCPA transformation rates, and of PO4/P-T concentrations to aldicarb
   transformation rates, are presented. These relationships are assessed as
   environmental indicators for potential biotransformation, but only under
   conditions warranting development and growth of a degrading population
   over a prolonged period. (C) 1999 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A sequential testing procedure for monitoring epidemiological data is
   considered. The approach is based on a discrete time process of interim
   analyses using the likelihood ratio as a test statistic. Sampling
   continues until either some predetermined practical time limit is
   reached or a decision can be made about the hazard rates characterizing
   the populations to be compared. The stopping boundaries of the
   sequential testing procedure are determined so as to control type I
   error at a given level during the whole study. Thus, the critical
   threshold is derived from the exact distribution of the maximum value of
   the test statistic which is observed across all the monitoring times. To
   this end, the appropriate quantiles in the probability distributions of
   interest are obtained empirically by Monte Carlo simulation, assuming
   both the null hypothesis and given experimental conditions. The method
   is illustrated by an example concerning the incidence of leukaemia in
   young people living in the vicinity of the French La Hague nuclear
   reprocessing plant. On the whole the previous analyses do not provide
   evidence for a spatial-temporal clustering of leukaemia, at least within
   the space-time window which was examined around the nuclear reprocessing
   plant (35 km radius, time period 1978-1992). (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The Bassin d'Arcachon (south-west France) was chosen as a model
   ecosystem to study the chemical and microbiological buffering towards
   free sulphide. Data were collected on the vertical distribution of
   oxygen, sulphur and iron compounds and the vertical distribution of
   colourless sulphur bacteria and sulphide-producing bacteria. In
   addition, data on the chemical and biological buffering capacity towards
   free sulphide were collected in sediment slurries from defined depth
   layers using a biological sulphide and oxygen monitor (BOSM) equipped
   with electrodes for oxygen, sulphide, redox and pH. The data showed that
   a substantial population of aerobic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria was
   present, yet buffering towards free sulphide could mainly be attributed
   to chemical processes: in particular, reactions with iron were of
   importance. Interestingly, the potential microbiological rate of
   sulphide oxidation was orders of magnitude higher than the rate of
   sulphate reduction reported for this ecosystem.
   The ecological implications of these observations for the Bassin
   d'Arcachon are that the powerful biological buffering capacity towards
   the free sulphide present will become effective after the chemical
   buffering capacity has been depleted. Under such conditions the
   colourless sulphur bacteria will no longer face the competition with
   iron, and thus may be expected to proliferate. The crucial factor then
   becomes the availability of oxygen. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The shell growth and reproductive cycle of Donax trunculus (Mollusca:
   Bivalvia) from southern Portugal were studied from December 1993 to
   November 1994. Both the acetate peel method and quantification of
   surface growth rings were used to establish age and estimate growth
   rate. Widely spaced growth bands were formed in spring and summer whilst
   narrowly spaced bands were deposited in late summer and early autumn. No
   cessation of growth was observed during the winter. The von Bertalanffy
   growth curve estimated from the internal bands did not differ
   significantly from that obtained from the surface rings. However, the
   age of clams can be determined more accurately from acetate peels than
   directly from surface rings. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that
   periodicity of the deposition of microgrowth bands was related to an
   innate rhythm. Gonadal development was monitored using standard
   histological methods, Both males and females showed synchronism in
   gonadal development. The gametogenic cycle began in late November and
   ended in late August. Spawning occurred between March and August with
   two major spawning phases: March and May-August. D. trunculus reached
   maturity during the first year of life. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B,V.

   without previous termite exposure were tested for acceptance by worker
   termites from three populations of Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) or
   Reticulitermes virginicus Banks in a choice feeding assay. Termites were
   given a choice of four feeding stations that were either previously
   exposed to nestmates, conspecifics, allospecifics, or that had no
   previous termite contact. Differences in corrugated cardboard
   consumption rates among treatments were used as a measure of

Abstract = {{Resource managers in the western United States have long assumed that
   water was a key limiting factor on wildlife populations in arid
   habitats. Beginning in the 1940s-1950s, state and federal resource
   management agencies initiated water development programs intended to
   benefit game species and other wildlife. At least 5,859 such
   developments have been built in 11 western states. Most state wildlife
   management agencies in the western United States have ongoing wildlife
   water development programs that vary greatly in extent. Ranchers and
   range managers also have developed water sources for livestock, many of
   which also are used by wildlife. Recently, critics have suggested that
   wildlife water developments have not yielded expected benefits, and may
   negatively impact wildlife by increasing predation, competition, and
   disease transmission. Based upon a comprehensive review of scientific
   literature, we conclude that wildlife water developments have likely
   benefitted many game and non-game species, blur not all water
   development projects have yielded expected increases in animal
   distribution and abundance. Hypothesized negative impacts of water
   developments on wildlife are not supported by data and remain largely
   speculative. However, our understanding of both positive and negative
   effects of wildlife water developments is incomplete, because of design
   limitations of previous research. Longterm, experimental studies are
   needed to address unanswered questions concerning the efficacy and
   ecological effects of water developments. We also recommend that
   resource managers apply more rigorous planning criteria to new
   developments, and expand monitoring efforts associated with water
   development programs.}},

Abstract = {{Point counts are commonly used to monitor bird populations, and a
   substantial amount of research has investigated how conducting counts
   for different lengths of time affects the accuracy of these counts and
   the subsequent ability to monitor changes in population trends. However,
   little work has been done to assess how changes in count duration affect
   bird-habitat models developed from point count data. In this paper, we
   present an empirical comparison of the performance of bird-habitat
   models, which were developed via logistic regression analyses based on
   point count data from 3-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min counts. We also
   investigated the effect of die number of visits to each sun ey point on
   model performance. We assessed model performance on the basis of
   R-2-values and percent concordant pairs. A positive relation between
   model performance and count duration was most apparent for species with
   relatively low detection probabilities, whereas performance of models
   for species with relatively high detectability was fairly consistent or
   even decreased as count duration increased. Our results suggest that
   while some improvement in bird-habitat models for species with low
   detection rates can be achieved via longer point counts, the modest
   gains in model performance should be weighed against the increased time
   and effort required to conduct longer counts. Models based on data from
   a single visit to each point did not performed as well as models based
   on multiple visits. However. we found little or no improvement in model
   performance when the number of visits per point increased from 2 to 3.
   We suggest that current recommendations on point count durations (5 or
   10 min) will provide adequate data for modeling bird-habitat relations.}},

Abstract = {{To fully understand the effects of han est and other anthropogenic
   factors on raccoon (Procyon lotor) populations, information is needed on
   survival of raccoons that are protected from these types of mortality We
   monitored raccoons in South Texas during 1990-93 to determine age- and
   sex-specific survivorship of a raccoon population protected from legal
   harvest. Juvenile survivorship was low (S = 0.65) during the nestling
   stage but increased as young matured and began traveling with mothers.
   Nestling survival was related to natal den type. Monthly survival
   distributions differed (P < 0.05) between yearling and adult raccoons,
   but there was no difference (P > 0.05) between adult males and females.
   Our annual survival estimates for males and females (S = 0.84) were
   higher than those reported for a harvested population in Iowa. Our
   comparison of survival estimates from Iowa and Texas suggests han est
   may be additive for raccoons or, if han est is compensatory, raccoons in
   Iowa may have lower survival than raccoons in Texas, regardless of
   harvest.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the reproductive biology of a captive population
   of brush-tailed phascogales Phascogale tapoatafa. A `round robin' mating
   system was established in which seven adult male animals were rotated
   through seven adult females. Changes in vaginal cytology and peripheral
   plasma progesterone and oestradiol levels were monitored to determine
   features of the female reproductive cycle. Regular measurement of
   scrotal diameter, collection of testicular biopsies and monitoring of
   plasma testosterone levels was used to assess male reproductive
   activity. Oestrous cycle length was estimated as 40 +/- 5 days (n = 7)
   and gestation length as 27+/-5 days (n = 7). Plasma progesterone levels
   showed no significant variation. This negative result is attributed to
   the small sample size (n = 4). Plasma oestradiol levels however,
   followed the predicted pattern, with an increase in peripheral
   concentration occurring prior to the breeding season. Oestradiol
   concentration peaked at 246.9 +/- 169.2 pg ml(-1) (mean +/- se) just
   before mating and declined to 24.3 +/- 12.0 Fg ml(-1) after mating.
   Histological studies of testicular biopsies revealed that
   spermatogenesis does not cease until after the breeding season has
   begun, in contrast to Antechinus species, in which spermatogenesis
   ceases before breeding. Plasma testosterone levels increased at the
   onset of the breeding season, peaking at 6.3 +/- 0.60 ng ml(-).
   Testosterone concentrations remained high until approximately 3 weeks
   after breeding, followed by a decline to pre-breeding levels. Litter
   size and sex ratio did not vary significantly between first- and
   second-year females. Females did not undergo a second oestrous cycle
   when pouch young were removed 15 and 17 days after parturition.}},

Abstract = {{Development of stem nematode (Ditylenchus dipsaci) infestations of white
   clover (Trifolium repens) in artificially established swards and
   transplanted turfs was monitored at field sites with different mean
   daily temperatures. In artificial swards the level of nematode
   infestation was inversely related to mean daily temperature. In
   transplanted turfs, nematodes caused a 46\% reduction in white clover
   density over an 18-month period; the level of damage was not
   significantly affected by mean daily temperature although the proportion
   of clover stolons infested was higher at colder temperatures. Reductions
   in infestation levels at higher temperatures are probably the result of
   reduced survival in soil and the upper lethal temperature for nematodes
   being exceeded more frequently under warmer conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Due to rapidly changing physical and biochemical characteristics of
   growing leaves, correlations between traits of foliage biochemistry and
   the performance indices of flush feeding herbivores may vary
   considerably following relatively minor changes in experimental
   conditions. We examined the effects of the seasonal and inter-tree
   variation of a comprehensive array of biochemical compounds on the
   success of an early season geometrid, Epirrita autumnata, feeding on
   maturing foliage of mountain birch, Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii.
   We monitored the concentrations of individual phenolics, sugars, total
   nitrogen, nitrogen of proteins, and nitrogen of soluble compounds, water
   and acetone-insoluble residue. Simultaneously we recorded larval
   consumption, physiological performance, growth, and pupal mass of E.
   autumnata. We found significant phenological changes in almost all leaf
   traits measured. In bioassays with half-grown leaves, leaf gallotannin
   concentrations showed a nonlinear effect: in trees with high foliar
   gallotannin concentrations (over 10 mg g(-1)), physiological performance
   was strongly reduced by high gallotannin concentrations. In trees with
   lower gallotannin concentrations, on the other hand, larval growth was
   reduced by soluble proanthocyanidins, not gallotannins. Differences
   between high and low gallotannin trees largely depended on phenology,
   i.e., on the age of leaves. However, not all the differences in leaf
   traits between late (with high gallotannin concentrations at the time of
   the bioassay) and early flushing trees disappeared with leaf maturation,
   indicating that there is also phenology-independent variance in the tree
   population. In the full-grown leaves of all the study trees, low
   concentrations of water and of nitrogen of proteins (but not nitrogen of
   soluble compounds) were the main factors reducing pupal masses of E.
   autumnata, while neither gallotannin nor proanthocyanidins now played a
   significant role. The observed change in the factors underlying leaf
   duality (from gallotannins and proanthocyanidins to nitrogen and water)
   relate to the activity of the shikimate pathway and the formation of
   cell walls: gallotannins and proanthocyanidins are both produced in the
   pathway, and these tannins are assumed to contribute - via binding into
   cell walls - to tough and durable cell walls. Interestingly, low duality
   of leaves did not automatically translate into low foliar consumption
   (i.e., benefits to the tree). On the trees with young, high gallotannin
   leaves, larvae actually increased consumption on low quality foliage. In
   the group of trees with slightly more developed, low gallotannin leaves,
   the quality of leaves did not clearly modify amounts consumed. In
   full-grown leaves, low leaf duality strongly reduced leaf consumption.
   These results emphasize the strong influence of tree phenology on the
   relationships between biochemical compounds and the herbivore.}},

Abstract = {{An important environmental factor determining both phytoplankton and
   zooplankton community composition is lake depth and thermal
   stratification. However, there is little information on how the
   interaction between zooplankton grazers and their phytoplankton food
   changes along an environmental gradient of lake depth. We contrasted
   resource availability for daphniid zooplankton populations living in two
   shallow, unstratified lakes and in two deep, stratified lakes using a
   novel growth bioassay. Stratified lakes had consistently lower resource
   richness than shallow unstratified lakes. To test whether resources were
   important in explaining differences in daphniid composition of shallow
   and deep lakes, we performed reciprocal transplant experiments. We
   raised daphniids typical of shallow (Ceriodaphnia reticulata) and deep
   (Daphnia dentifera) lakes in the resources from replicate shallow and
   deep lakes and monitored survival and reproduction. The two species
   exhibited a performance trade-off, measured by life table r and R-0,
   across a gradient in natural resource richness. D. dentifera had higher
   relative fitness than C. reticulata when raised in the poorest resource
   environment from a deep lake. However, under richer resource conditions
   typical of shallow lakes, C. reticulata outperformed D, dentifera. We
   further created a gradient in natural resource quantity (by dilution) to
   test whether this trade-off in species relative fitness involved aspects
   of resource quality. No trade-off in species performance was evident
   across the dilution gradient, indicating that resource quality was
   important to the trade-off. We conclude that shifts in daphniid species
   composition along a gradient of lake depth involve an adaptive tradeoff
   in ability to exploit rich versus poor resource quality.}},

Abstract = {{Pupae of the pandora moth, Coloradia pandora, a Blake, were collected in
   central Oregon and stored at 5 degrees C for 8 to 24 weeks, then
   incubated at 25 degrees C. The minimum cold storage time required to
   break diapause was 12 weeks, but emergence rates were highest (87.5\%)
   for 14-18 weeks. In a separate experiment, 1000 pupae were maintained in
   field enclosures for 3 years while soil temperature was monitored.
   Seventy-two percent of these pupae emerged in Year 1. Soil temperature
   fell below 5 degrees C for 21.7, 22.9, and 25.1 weeks over the three
   consecutive winters, and the minimum soil T was -2 degrees C. In the lab
   study, greater than or equal to 22 weeks at 5 degrees C limited
   emergence to <40\%, therefore mortality from duration of cold could be
   considerable in winters such as Year 3. Prolonged (extended) diapause
   was observed in only 0.6\% of the sample population.}},

Abstract = {{Dam impacts on the downstream section of dammed rivers are known to be
   important for fish because of changes in the physical and chemical river
   characteristics. However, the available data seem to be insufficient to
   draw general conclusions regarding the transformation of fish
   communities. A hydroelectric dam was built on the Sinnamary River in
   French Guiana and closed in January 1994. From December 1991 to December
   1996 fish collections were made from the downstream section. The results
   show a rapid decrease in fish abundance in the middle downstream course
   immediately after dam closure. This low abundance was observed until the
   end of the filling phase, when the flow was maintained at a minimum
   level. Afterwards, abundance returned to a level comparable with that
   prior to dam closure. Fish collection in different zones showed that the
   decrease in abundance was probably due to the escape of fish to shelter
   areas. Another marked effect was the reduction of sample diversity due
   to a decrease in species richness, as well as in the regularity of the
   distribution of species' relative abundance. Examination of biological
   traits of species suggests that under these conditions feeding
   strategies could have been the most important factor affecting the
   abundance of populations. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical composition of crude oil and even of refined petroleum
   includes hundreds of different alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. Among
   these are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known
   carcinogens and widespread environmental contaminants. Some compounds
   present in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils are rapidly removed by the
   activities of autochthonous bacterial populations while other PAHs,
   especially those with four or more fused aromatic rings, are refractory
   to biodegradation. The persistence of high molecular weight polyaromatic
   hydrocarbons (hPAHs) in soils implies either that their low solubility
   renders them poorly available to bacteria, or that autochthonous
   bacteria do not contain the metabolic or co-metabolic pathways required
   for their degradation or both. The rate and extent of PAH degradation in
   contaminated soil is not always predictable for standard biological
   treatment strategies. This study examines a matrix of treatments
   suitable for land farming in order to identify those that maximize the
   removal of hPAHs. The treatments include those intended to increase the
   bioavailability of hPAH, such as additions of biosurfactant-producing
   bacteria (i.e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa \#64) and addition of light oils,
   as well as treatments intended to increase the metabolic potential of
   the bacterial community. The latter includes the addition of inorganic
   nutrients and bacterial strains capable of degrading hPAHs
   co-metabolically (i.e. Sphingomonas paucimobilis EPA 505). The efficacy
   of immobilizing PAM-degrading bacteria on vermiculite is also
   considered, as will be the monitoring of leachate for biodegradation of
   PAHs in a simulated land farming operation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Microsatellites were used for genetic analysis of maternal half-sib
   families of Quercus robur, pedunculate oak, a highly outcrossing tree
   species. A model half-sib family including the mother tree and 28
   offspring individuals as well as samples from six single tree harvests
   from a forestry company, 4-8 individuals each, were genotyped at 9
   microsatellite loci. No prior information about the genotypes of the
   mother trees were available for these six seedlot samples. Analysis of
   the model half-sib family revealed that the maternal genotypes can be
   inferred from the offspring genotypes due to codominant Mendelian
   inheritance of the microsatellites. Analysis of the single tree
   harvests, supplied as six maternal half-sib families, revealed
   contaminations with unrelated seedlings in four out of six cases.
   Average relatedness between the remaining individuals indicated that
   they were indeed half-sibs, probably with a proportion of full-sibs
   among them. For five samples the genotypes of the mother trees were
   partially inferred from the offspring genotypes, The supposed number of
   five different mother trees was confirmed by direct comparison of the
   maternal genotypes and by pairwise F-ST calculations between families,
   We show that correct genotype reconstruction can be confirmed by
   monitoring recombination events between linked markers. Our results
   demonstrate that microsatellite analysis is a suitable means to approach
   two key problems of legal regulations on the marketing of seed material
   from pedunculate oak: the number of trees included in seed harvests and
   the detection of seed contaminations.}},

Abstract = {{The only remaining self-sustaining population of striped bass Morone
   saxatilis in the Bay of Fundy spawns in the tidal bore-dominated
   Shubenacadie-Stewiacke watershed, Nova Scotia, but how this population
   spawns in such a harsh watershed is unknown. Egg deposition and water
   quality were monitored in the Stewiacke River about 2 km downstream of
   the spawning grounds from May 23 to June 15, 1994. Replicate samples
   taken every 1.5 h (16 times/d) were cued to within 30 min before and
   after the tidal bore and 15 min after high slack tide. On spring tide,
   the tidal bore and flood tide changed the river elevation 3.7 m and the
   salinity from 0 parts per thousand to 20 parts per thousand within 1 h;
   neap tide changes were the smallest measured during the study. Three
   major spawning peaks were observed: June 2-4, 6-9, and 13-14. Major
   spawning activity was cued to the neap tide, which had the smallest
   fluctuations in salinity (0-8 parts per thousand) and temperature
   (16.2-18.1 degrees C) and the greatest water clarity (10-45 cm). Major
   spawning activity commenced when water temperature reached 18 degrees C;
   water temperatures fluctuated more with tidal cycle than with seasonal
   progression. Approximately 67\% of the eggs collected were less than 10
   h old, and 9\% were 30 or more hours old. Only 61 larvae were collected.
   Total estimated egg production (+/-SD) for this population in 1994 was
   106.185 +/- 10.6 million, based on all eggs less than 10 h old caught in
   paired surface and paired bottom nets. Most eggs less than 10 h old were
   collected during ebbing tides at water velocities below 0.4 m/s, water
   temperatures of 18.0-21.9 degrees C, and salinities of 0-1.9 parts per
   thousand. Unfertilized eggs had a density of 1.0016 at 17 degrees C,
   eggs less than 10 h old had a density of 1.0029, and eggs with fully
   developed larvae had a density between 1.0060 and 1.0066. Youngest eggs
   were most buoyant, and oldest eggs were heavier, which probably plays an
   important role in the eggs being retained within lowest salinity waters
   and within or near the tidal bore on hood tides until hatching.
   Shubenacadie striped bass apparently require environmental conditions
   similar to populations in other watersheds, but the fate of eggs and
   larvae in this system is quite different, which are factors that should
   be considered if this population is used in aquaculture programs or
   population restocking efforts.}},

Abstract = {{A travel cost demand model was estimated for recreational angling for
   snapper Pagrus auratus in Port Phillip Bay based on an on-site
   expenditure survey conducted during the 1996-1997 season. The model
   explaining angling trip frequency was initially based on exploratory
   analysis and Fisher tests on variables including trip-specific
   expenditure and nonexpenditure factors. A final preferred Poisson count
   model was then estimated and used to calculate the annual angler surplus
   (Aus\$7,100 per boat party) and the total benefits to the angling
   population (\$128,000,000). The recreational and commercial sectors of
   the Port Phillip Bay snapper fishery are neither monitored by the same
   statistics nor valuated by the same methods. Considerable socioeconomic
   research is needed to calibrate the sectors in support of equitable
   harvest allocations.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of changing wastewater composition and SRT on an anaerobic
   mixed population were modelled and compared with the results from
   continuous degradation studies of a lactic, butyric, propionic and
   acetic acid containing wastewater. Particular attention was paid to the
   population dynamics in the membrane-coupled anaerobic pilot-scale
   reactor, with population data provided by in situ hybridization
   techniques. The microbial community structure was characterized using
   fluorescent, ribosomal RNA targeted oligonucleotide probes specific for
   Bacteria, Archaea and phylogenetically defined groups of methanogens and
   sulfate-reducing bacteria. Specific cell counts were determined by a
   combination of in situ hybridization and epifluorescence microscopy. The
   anaerobic population was dominated by Archaea belonging to the genus
   Methanosaeta, whereas sulfate-reducing bacteria were monitored to a less
   extent.
   The mathematical model was successful in simulating organic substrate
   degradation, pH in the reactor, liquid-gas transport of gaseous products
   and the long-term development of the anaerobic consortia. In the model
   the microbial population was grouped into substrate-specific organisms
   and compared to the measured amounts of acetogenic and methanogenic
   cells. At high SRT the hybridization data underestimated the actual
   number of active cells in the system. With the new technique of in situ
   hybridization and mathematical simulation promising tools were combined
   which help to understand the complex interactions in anaerobic mixed
   populations and the influence of reactor operational modes. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Recently, there have been attempts to identify a set of key
   environmental indicators for Victoria's marine and coastal environments.
   The recommendation that seagrass density and abundance be used as
   indicators requires that the effects on seagrass resulting from changes
   in the physical environment be predictable. This paper presents a
   stochastic population model for Zostera muelleri in Port Phillip Bay,
   Victoria. Building the model identified a number of issues that relate
   to constructing models for modular organisms. Of particular importance
   are the assumptions made when devising demographic structure and
   modelling complex population ecology in data poor environments. The
   project has provided a preliminary framework for the evaluation of
   potential environmental indicators and the monitoring programs developed
   for them. Using the probability of falling below a range of population
   densities, we were able to specify a background risk against which
   impacts may be measured. In this case, there was a 50\% chance that the
   population density would fall below 230 individuals per m(2) at least
   once in the next 20 years. Simulations representing the impacts of
   turbidity plumes are presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{At the end of the 19th century, after prolonged and extensive
   harvesting, indigenous giant tortoises had been eliminated from all
   islands in the Indian Ocean, except Aldabra atoll, where only a few
   survived. With greatly reduced levels of exploitation during the 20th
   century, the population recovered to a revised estimated total of 129
   000 in 1973-1974, when the first sample census was conducted. A repeat
   census in 1997 revealed a highly significant reduction in numbers over
   the past 24 years to an estimated total of 100 000. The great majority
   of tortoises are still found at relatively high density in south-eastern
   Grande Terre, where the number of animals has declined by more than
   one-third. In contrast, low-density subpopulations on Malabar and Picard
   have almost doubled in size, but they represent less than 5\% of the
   total population. Corroborative evidence for the crash in the Grande
   Terre subpopulation comes from two independent observations: a
   significant increase in tortoise mortality; and a significant decline in
   tortoise counts on long-term population monitoring transects. These
   population changes are attributed to natural population regulatory
   mechanisms, exacerbated by low rainfall years in the period 1980-1997,
   including two consecutive years of below average rainfall in 1995-1996
   and 1996-1997.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding behaviour of the Talek dan of spotted hyaenas in the Masai
   Mara National Reserve, Kenya, was monitored continuously for 7 years.
   Talek hyaenas adapted to large temporal variations in prey abundance by
   being opportunistic predators. During the first half of the year, the
   hyaenas fed on resident ungulates, and their diet consisted mainly of
   topi and Thomson's gazelles. Upon arrival of the migratory herds of
   wildebeest and zebra from the Serengeti, Talek hyaenas switched to
   feeding on the wildebeest which provided them with a superabundance of
   food for about 3 months. After the migratory animals returned to the
   Serengeti, Talek hyaenas experienced a period of reduced prey abundance
   due to the temporary dispersion of resident ungulates. At this time
   hyaenas hunted the few remaining wildebeest, and also increased their
   use of the remaining resident animals. Although Talek hyaenas were
   generally opportunistic in their feeding behaviour, they did exhibit
   clear dietary preference for larger pl ey species, particularly
   wildebeest. Finally, carrion comprised only 5\% of the biomass consumed
   by Talek hyaenas, the lowest proportion of carrion in the diet of any
   Crocuta population studied to date.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworms, which inhabit soils and litter layers in most landscapes,
   can offer an important tool to evaluate different environmental
   transformations and impacts. Agricultural landscapes, urban and
   industrialized habitats have some earthworms that represent interesting
   indicators to monitor different contaminations, to assess different
   farming practices and different landscape structures and
   transformations. Species number, abundance and biomass can give easily
   measurable elements. Ecological guilds can help in comparing different
   environments.
   Taxonomy is relatively well known, at least in temperate areas, when
   species identification is in general easily solved. CD-ROM based
   programs facilitate rapid identification of collected specimens.
   The substantial amount of research carried out on these invertebrates
   has made these soil organisms more promising for further improved and
   accurate work in assessing sustainability of different environments. In
   most cases earthworm biomass or abundance can offer a valuable tool to
   assess different environmental impacts such as tillage operations, soil
   pollution, different agricultural input, trampling, industrial plant
   pollution, etc. In rural environments different farming systems can be
   assessed using earthworm biomass and numbers. (C)1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Pollinators and pollination are crucial in the functioning of almost all
   terrestrial ecosystems including those dominated by agriculture because
   they are in the front line of sustainable productivity through plant
   reproduction. Pollinators are bioinidicators as individuals and
   populations in that they can be used to monitor environmental stress
   brought about by introduced competitors, diseases, parasites, predators
   as well as by chemical and physical factors, particularly pesticides and
   habitat modification. Honeybees an useful as samplers of the
   environments in which they are kept and have been used to assess
   atmospheric and other types of pollution. Pollinator guildes offer new
   means of assessing ecosystemic health because the species diversity and
   abundance relationship is changed from the log-normal standard expected
   from ecological principles and niche theory. (C)1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A simple modification to the hive bottom board was tested as a
   non-chemical or cultural control method for varroa mites. Wire mesh
   hardware cloth was used to replace the majority of the surface area of
   the bottom board underneath the brood area, allowing varroa to fall
   through and potentially excluding them from reentering the colony.
   Thirty colonies received no chemical treatment but were fitted with
   screen bottom boards, sticky boards or normal bottom boards. Mite fall
   was monitored in these colonies on a monthly basis and revealed
   approximately 14\% and 28\% lower mite fall in the two modified bottom
   boards compared to the normal bottom board in June and July,
   respectively. However, by September mite Levels in all three sets of
   colonies had reached damaging Levels. Thus', the bottom board
   modification slowed the growth rate of varroa, but is not sufficient
   alone. Mite invasion pressure into colonies was monitored using
   Apistan(R) in three colonies and increased in August and September to
   greater than 100 mites per colony over a three day period. This level of
   invasion surely added to the decline of all colonies. A modified bottom
   board that allows varroa to fall through and prevents direct contact
   with bees showed promise in the current studies by slowing varroa
   populations and is proposed as a cultural control. Additionally,
   colonies with mesh bottom boards had significantly more sealed brood
   than colonies on normal bottom boards, an added benefit to using this
   hive modification. The use of a screen bottom board or screen insert in
   conjunction with resistant lines of bees, smoke, dusts, or other control
   agents should provide a more integrated approach to varroa control and
   could reduce the number of chemical treatments required.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of seedlings to survive for extended periods beneath intact
   forest increases the likelihood of regeneration of many species of
   canopy trees in rainforests. I studied the demographics of Argyrodendron
   actinophyllum (F.M.Bail.) H.L.Edlin seedlings in a subtropical
   rainforest in northern New South Wales. A mast seeding of A.
   actinophyllum was observed and subsequent survival of seedlings
   monitored over a four year period. Densities of seedlings that emerged
   correlated with seedfall, while seedfall depended on the size and
   distance to the surrounding trees. Mortality of seedlings showed
   density-dependence at higher seedling densities (above about 100
   seedlings m(-2)), apparently in response to browsing pressure that
   varied with the density of seedlings. Seedlings that were protected from
   vertebrates by exclosure cages had lower mortality rates than
   unprotected seedlings and showed no density response. Glasshouse
   experiments showed seedling growth was reduced by defoliation, light
   intensity and initial seed weight, and that seedlings could nor, persist
   at light intensities below about 1\% ambient, which occur in darker
   patches on the forest floor. Possible mechanisms whereby the observed
   spatial and temporal patterns of seedling recruitment could reduce the
   likelihood of the species becoming more common relative to other tree
   species in the forest are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Operational scale field trials were conducted in 1996 and 1997, in the
   east of rite Niger Republic, on 50 and 800 hectare plots, to compare the
   efficacy of an oil based formulation of the entomopathogenic fungus,
   Metarhizium anisopliae (flavoviride) var. acridum (Deuteromycotina:
   Hyphomycetes) with fenitrothion for the control of Sahelian
   grasshoppers. The Senegalese Grasshopper Oedaleus senegalensis Krauss
   was the most abundant species in the trials. M. anisopliae was applied
   at 5 x 10(12) spores ha(-1) at volume application rates of 2 and 0.5 l
   ha(-1) in successive years. Fenitrothion was applied at 220 g ha(-1) at
   1.25 and 0.22 l h(-1) volume application rates. Ultra low volume
   equipment mounted on a vehicle (1996) or a fixed wing aircraft (1997)
   was used for application. The M. anisopliae treatment reduced the
   grasshopper population significantly after 7 days and by 93\% within 16
   days. Fenitrothion caused a population reduction of more than 90\%
   shortly after application, but due to immigration, the grasshopper
   population recovered to the initial level within 16 days. Grasshoppers
   treated with the fungus and given the opportunity to thermoregulate in
   the sun died more slowly than grasshoppers incubated in the shade. The
   survival of spores in the spray residue of the M. anisopliae plots
   assessed by exposing grasshoppers to the sprayed vegetation at intervals
   and monitoring disease levels during subsequent laboratory incubation,
   showed the spray residue to remain highly infective, for three weeks
   after spraying. At the end of the 1997 season, egg pod density and
   viability in the plot treated with the fungus was reduced compared with
   both untreated and the fenitrothion plots.
   Compared with the existing practice of large-scale treatment of
   grasshopper infestations with fenitrothion, use of M. anisopliae would
   not only be safer to mammals and less damaging to non-target organisms,
   but also be more effective in the long-term control of grasshoppers.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation history of an endemic New Zealand reptile, tuatara
   (Sphenodon spp.) is used to illustrate the necessity for accurate
   knowledge of population abundance for the effective management and
   subsequent recovery of threatened species. The precision and relative
   cost of line transect and mark-recapture estimates of abundance were
   compared in a population of tuatara (Sphenadon punctatus) on Lady Alice
   Island in the Hen and Chicken Group, northern New Zealand. Estimates of
   density ranged 13.6-17.7 tuatara per hectare. Line transect methods
   provided estimates of density which were not detectably different from
   mark-recapture estimates. Both methods are likely to underestimate
   `true' tuatara abundance where only a proportion of the population is
   ever available for sampling. Line transects created less animal stress,
   less environmental disturbance, and required significantly less cost in
   time, effort, and personnel. The monitoring of population abundance is
   an integral part of the recovery process for any threatened species.
   Recommendations for the future monitoring of tuatara status include the
   further use of line transect methods as cost effective estimators of
   population abundance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Characters involved in pollinaror attraction are likely maintained by
   selection. Plants that invest more in flora displays and/or rewards are
   expected to attract more pollinators than those that do nor. A large
   number of plants, however, are severely pollen-limited yet either
   produce small rewards or none at all. The orchid, Comparettia falcata,
   is a pollinator-dependent, self-compatible epiphyte distributed
   throughout the Greater Antilles, Central and South America. In Puerto
   Rico where it is pollinated by the hummingbird Chlorostilbon maugaeus,
   C. falcata presents a smaller nectar reward than most other plants
   pollinated by the same species. To determine whether or nor selection
   would favor the production of higher nectar levels, we enhanced the
   quantity of nectar offered by flowers in a Puerto Rican population for
   two flowering seasons. We monitored visitation frequencies, pollen
   movement, and reproductive success at three sites with different canopy
   coverages. Daily censuses of hummingbirds provided estimates of relative
   pollinator abundance. A multiway contingency test employing Wald's
   statistic showed no overall differences in reproductive success between
   plants with enhanced rewards and unmanipulated controls. Site
   differences, however, were clear. Plants of the mid- and high-light
   sites had greater success than those of the low-light sire, and the
   differences were usually at lease two-fold. There was a significant
   site-treatment interaction in reproductive success that could be
   attributed to the overall trend whereby controls of both mid- and
   high-light sites did better than the nectar-enhanced plants. Most of the
   observed pollinations (85\%) with stained pollinia resulted in
   self-pollinations that did nor differ among treatments. Seed crops from
   self and cross-pollinations revealed no differences in the number of
   viable seeds. Because we found little evidence of selection for
   increasing nectar reward via inbreeding depression or male and female
   reproductive success, and previous studies have indicated that meager
   natural levels of reward are better than none at all, we suspect thar
   reward production in C. falcata may be driven by a combination of
   pollination-limitation and resource constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Dadia Forest in north-eastern Greece is well known for its diversity of
   breeding birds of prey. In 1980, the area was declared a wildlife
   reserve. One of the most endangered species at that time was the Black
   Vulture Aegypius monachus. To help the population of Black Vultures a
   feeding station was established in 1987. A monitoring programme from
   1984 until present indicates that the operation of the feeding station
   has coincided with an increase in the numbers of Black Vultures
   wintering in Dadia by nearly threefold, an increase in the number of
   breeding pairs from 10 to 21, and an increase in breeding success from
   40\% to a peak of 95\% A slight faltering in the continued rise in the
   numbers of Black Vultures in Dadia is attributed to a poisoning event in
   1995.}},

Abstract = {{Two rotating smelt traps were used through 4 consecutive years to
   monitor emigrations of age-0 chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
   from two watersheds of the upper South Umpqua River basin, Oregon,
   U.S.A. The number of wild smelts moving past the mainstem South Umpqua
   River trap ranged from 26 455 in 1991 to less than 5000 in 1993. The
   number of wild smelts passing the Jackson Creek trap ranged from 13 345
   in 1991 to 0 in 1993. Higher numbers of wild smelts were significantly
   (P = 0.003) correlated with higher numbers of prespawning adults counted
   in index reaches the preceding year. Timing of emigration of smelts was
   found to be significantly related to stream temperature (P < 0.05) and
   phase of the lunar cycle (P < 0.05) but not related to changes in
   discharge (P > 0.05). Median emigration dates, which varied over 9
   weeks, were earlier when spring water temperatures were higher. On
   average, two thirds of yearly smelt runs occurred when the moon was
   either waning or new, even though these moon phases were present only
   about half of the time. Significantly (P < 0.05) more fish than expected
   emigrated past both traps when day length was increasing.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy cattle and pig manure mixed with sphagnum peat and a little barley
   straw was composted in a continuously working horizontal drum composting
   system in three successive series. Changes in microbiological and
   chemical parameters were monitored during the six days' processing in
   the drum and the subsequent three months' curing in heaps.
   The temperature of the composting mass in the middle of the drum varied
   between 42-45 degrees C; the outfeeds had an initial temperature of 40
   degrees C; and within two to three days the heaps had reached a
   temperature of 65-70 degrees C which was maintained for a few days.
   Hygienization, as determined by the absence of fecal streptococci, was
   mostly reached in six days' active composting in the drum. The most
   abundant bacteria in the feeding materials were mesophilic bacteria. The
   amounts of these fell slightly during the processing in the drum, but
   they rose again during the curing period as a whole and remained high,
   varying from 4.2x10(8) to 1.7x10(10) CFU/g(dw). Thermophilic bacterial
   populations remained fairly constant during the composting, varying
   between 10(7) and 7x10(8) CFU/g(dw).
   Microbial activity in the feeding material, measured in terms of
   dehydrogenase activity, was typically high during composting, varying
   from 24.4 to 27.8 mu mol TPF/g(dw)/3 h. During processing in the drum it
   remained high, but during curing it showed a decreasing trend, and by
   the end of the experiment it had stabilized at a low level in all the
   experimental heaps, varying from 0.71 to 1.53 mu mol TPF/g(dw)/3 h,
   indicating maturation of the compost.
   The ratio C/N-final to C/N (initial) fell to 0.66-0.77 and then to
   0.55-0.74 after two months' and three months' curing, respectively. The
   average loss of C, calculated from C/P data, was during the drum
   composting 12\%, and 39\% when calculated for the mature composts. The
   average N loss was 16\% in the drum, but only 5\% when calculated for
   the mature compost. The total amount of water-soluble mineral N fell
   from c. 450-500 mg/100 g(dw) in the infeeds to c. 90-160 mg/100 g(dw) in
   the composts after the 1st turn. Thereafter it gradually rose again to
   the initial level. During composting the proportion of NH4-N declined
   from 100\% to below 20\%. PO4-P concentration showed an increasing trend
   during the whole composting process, and stabilized after two to three
   months' curing to a level of 400 mg P/100 g(dw).}},

   bias, however, is not likely to cause bottlenecks to go undetected or to
   cause misguided management recommendations. The bias was nearly
   negligible for bottlenecks of effective size greater than or equal to
   10, until approximately five bottleneck generations had passed. Three
   causes of the bias are the loss of alleles, the assumption that the
   increase in variance in allele frequencies with time is additive
   (instead of multiplicative), and the assumption that selfing can occur
   when it cannot. We derived a new equation that substantially reduces the
   bias. The precision of N-c estimates was sufficient that, when true N-c
   was 4, the 95\% confidence interval bracketing a N-c estimate was <25 in
   95\% of 500 simulations (when only five microsatellite loci were
   monitored and when 30 individuals were sampled with a sampling interval
   of one generation). When the true N-c was 20, however, only 80\% of the
   confidence intervals were <50 when we sampled 45 individuals and 20
   microsatellite loci (i.e., loci with five alleles). High power to detect
   a bottleneck of effective size 4 can be achieved by monitoring interval
   of one generation. But achieving high power to detect bottlenecks of
   size N-c = 20 requires approximately 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci
   and 45 individuals with a one-generation sampling interval.}},

Abstract = {{It is often hypothesized that bacteria that are superior competitors
   when resources are abundant must be inferior competitors when resources
   are scarce, and vice versa. Most previous studies that sought to test
   this trade-off hypothesis compared kinetic parameters of extant strains
   of bacteria, with mixed results. We employed an experimental approach in
   which bacterial populations were propagated for many generations under
   two distinct regimes and their evolutionary responses were monitored.
   Thirty-six populations of bacteria were allowed to adapt evolutionarily
   to either abundant (batch culture) or scarce (chemostat culture)
   resource regimes. The competitive fitness of each derived line, relative
   to its ancestor, was then measured under both regimes. The trade-off
   hypothesis predicts that adaptation to either selective regime causes a
   concomitant loss of fitness under the alternative regime. Overall, our
   findings failed to support this hypothesis, and several cases contradict
   it. Only two derived lines showed clear trade-offs, having significantly
   adapted to the selective regime while becoming significantly less fit in
   the alternative regime. By contrast, five derived lines significantly
   improved in the alternative regime even as they adapted to their
   selective regime. Summing over all 36 derived lines (including those for
   which the observed fitness changes were nonsignificant under one or both
   regimes), 15 cases support the trade-off hypothesis, whereas 21 indicate
   the opposite result. These data therefore refute the necessity, or even
   general tendency, for evolutionary trade-offs in performance under
   conditions of resource abundance vs. scarcity. Instead, these data
   suggest that bacteria are able to adapt to a particular level of
   resource via multiple evolutionary pathways, which may produce either
   gains or losses in fitness at some different level of resource.}},

Abstract = {{Factors affecting individual variation in between-year territory change
   and dispersal distance were measured in a long-term study of Black Kites
   (Milvus migrans) living in an area of similar to 100 000 ha in and
   around Donana National Park in southern Spain. Adult birds (N = 210) and
   fledlings (N = 3061) were individually marked, and breeding birds were
   monitored annually during 1989-1996 to detect banded individuals. Of
   these 3271 birds, 652 breeding birds were resighted, and 164 of them
   were sexed through copulatory behavior. Nests were checked annually to
   monitor breeding performance.
   Frequencies of return between years were 83.1\% for breeding males and
   89.5\% for breeding females. Frequencies of territory change were 25.6\%
   and 32.8\%, respectively. Females >8 yr old rarely changed territories.
   Dispersing birds departed significantly more from low-quality
   territories (evaluated through breeding success variables). Breeding
   failure and mate loss (divorce or death) favored breeding dispersion,
   both in males and females, but females changed territories more
   frequently after nest predation. We did not detect effects of resource
   availability, conspecific breeding density, or mate quality on the
   frequency of territory change. When all the variables were included into
   a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), only breeding success, mate loss, and
   the interaction between the two had significant effects on territory
   change. Dispersal distance of birds that had changed territory was
   similar for males and females (median = 302 m). Ninety percent of
   individuals moved <5 km, and none moved >10 km. Distance moved depended
   on the bird's age and territory quality, but a GLM model retained only
   age as a significant variable: older birds (males and females) dispersed
   shorter distances.
   These results indicate that breeding territory change and dispersal
   distance are different individual decisions and are determined by
   different selective pressures. Dispersal consequences were significant
   only for females: they tended to change to territories with a lower risk
   of predation and obtained higher breeding success in the new location.
   Moreover, individuals in the new territories had higher breeding success
   than those occupying abandoned territories the same year. Dispersal
   distances were not correlated with the new territory quality and
   probability of breeding failure. Black Kites remained close to their
   former breeding places; individual competitive abilities may determine
   the final dispersal distance. Short-distance movements in dispersal are
   probably related to benefits of philopatry (ecological and genetic) and
   dispersal costs associated with finding a new territory in a saturated
   population, such as the one studied.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral theories, insights, and techniques are too frequently ignored
   by conservation biologists. Yet an animal's survival and reproductive
   success clearly depend on its behavior. Using examples from marine,
   freshwater, and terrestrial realms, I assert that behavioral information
   is invaluable in five conservation areas: (1) managing wild species
   (e.g., designing marine reserves; reducing animal-human conflicts;
   understanding and managing species' responses to human-induced
   environmental stress such as fishing, introduced species, and chemical,
   visual, and acoustic pollution); (2) actively reversing the decline of
   imperiled wild species (e.g., reducing by catch by improving selectivity
   of fishing gear; re-establishing breeding populations and boosting
   reproduction); (3) assessing biodiversity (e.g., modeling population
   viability; censusing and monitoring populations and species); (4)
   captive breeding and reintroduction programs (e.g., minimizing loss of
   valuable phenotypes; teaching or maintaining valuable survival skills);
   and (5) changing human behavior in resource exploitation (e.g., using
   principles from social psychology). Both realized and potential
   applications to fishes are stressed. Finally, behavioral diversity, a
   valuable but neglected element of biodiversity, needs to be explicitly
   conserved to maintain diverse populations. Arguments are presented that
   the conservation of species diversity and genetic diversity alone does
   not necessarily protect important behavioral diversity. The maintenance
   of both individual and population variability may be essential for the
   preservation of a species.}},

Abstract = {{In April of 1996 the rough-fairway interface of a golf course consisting
   entirely of perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L., was altered by
   implementing a new mowing regime. The experiment contained 4
   replications of 4 treatments: turf mowed to fairway height 1995-1997,
   turf mowed to rough height 1995-1997, turf that was fairway height in
   1995 and was allowed to grow to rough height in 1996-1997, and turf that
   was rough height in 1995 and was cut to fairway height in 1996-1997.
   Glass vials were used as pitfall traps to monitor activity of
   surface-dwelling predators and adult Ataenius spretulus (Haldeman). In
   1996, the most A. spretulus larvae were found in plots where the turf
   was mowed to fairway height the previous year, regardless of how the
   turf was mowed that year. However, adult Philonthus spp. (Staphylinidae)
   were found in the highest numbers in the plots that were mowed to rough
   height, regardless of how the turf height in past years. In 1997, the
   highest populations of A, spretulus adults and larvae were found in
   plots mowed to fairway height in 1996 and in 1997, regardless of 1995
   mowing height. Also, twice as many larvae were infected with a milky
   disease causing pathogen, Bacillus sp., in the rough (68\%) compared
   with the fairway (31\%). The most prevalent staphylinids, Philonthus
   cognatus Stephens and P. carbonarius (Gravenhorst),were 3 times more
   abundant in rough-mowed turf compared with fairway-mowed turf. With
   grass species, irrigation, and previous pesticide use controlled by our
   experimental design, it appears that mowing practices are an important
   factor contributing to the skewed distribution of A. spretulos toward
   golf course fairways and away from the rough.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring traps baited with lepidopteran sex pheromones and synthetic
   floral volatiles were used to collect adult Hymenoptera in fields of
   cotton and corn. Species from Apoidea, Pompiloidea Scolioidea,
   Sphecoidea, and Vespoidea were collected, including the genera
   Ammophila, Apis, Bombus, Cerceris, Larra, Melissodes, Myzinum, and
   Tachytes, More Bombus spp. were collected from traps baited with
   Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) sex pheromone than those baited with
   phenylacetaldehyde, whereas more Sphecoidea were collected in
   phenylacetaldehyde-baited traps. Trap design was also an important
   factor in capture of various species. More Sphecoidea and Tiphioidea
   were collected in fabric cone-shaped traps than plastic funnel traps.
   Efforts should be made to develop traps and lures that consistently
   capture the target pest but do not attract or easily capture aculeate
   Hymenoptera to preserve beneficial populations.}},

Abstract = {{Pink bollworm, Pectinphora gossypiella (Saunders), has failed to
   establish economically damaging populations on southeastern U.S, cotton
   (Gossypium spp.). Failure to establish may be the result of prevention
   and quarantine programs or the physiological tolerances of the species.
   The objectives of this study were to determine which regions within the
   southeastern United Slates might support pink bollworm survival and
   reproduction and which environmental factors might preclude
   establishment. Three independent analyses based on logistic regression
   of output from climate matching software, Climex, indicate that the
   probability of establishment was >50\% in parts of Missouri, Arkansas,
   Louisiana Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia Florida, South Carolina North
   Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. At least 2 analyses concurred that the
   probability of establishment was greater than or equal to 80\% in
   portions of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and
   Georgia. All logistic regression models correctly classified 89-93\% of
   the locations where pink bollworm occurs in the southwestern United
   States or does not occur outside the United States cotton belt. The
   models incorrectly classified 13-18\% of the cases where successful
   establishment was predicted and 5-8\% of cases where establishment was
   considered unlikely. Cold winter temperatures, causing direct mortality,
   or cool summer temperatures, providing inadequate degree-days for
   development, reduce the probability of establishment in more northern
   states. Slowed population growth caused by excessive moisture also
   lessens, but does not eliminate, the chances for establishment in
   certain southeastern slates. These analyses do not indicate the
   potential severity of infestations. Nevertheless, the risk assessment
   suggests that monitoring efforts for presence and establishment of pink
   bollworm in the southeastern United States are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Few experimental studies have examined the movement of forest pest
   populations, particularly in response to management tactics that disrupt
   the growth of pest infestations. We quantified the interinfestation
   patterns of dispersal of the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus
   frontalis Zimmermann (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), by monitoring the fates
   of fluorescently marked beetles after emergence from small natural
   infestations. Dispersal patterns from 3 untreated infestations were
   compared with those from 6 infestations treated with the widely used
   disruption suppression tactic, cut-and-leave (infested trees are felled
   and left in the forest). Among untreated infestations, 10 +/- 4\% (+/-1
   SE) of the marked beetles were successful in colonizing experimentally
   created infestations located 100-500 m away. The highest proportion of
   marked beetles was recaptured at the nearest experimental infestations
   (at 100 m) and recaptures declined precipitously with distance from the
   source. Dispersal by beetles emerging from disrupted infestations showed
   a similar pattern to untreated infestations with respect to distance,
   but a much greater fr action of the beetles were recaptured at each
   distance. Overall, colonization success for treated infestations was 37
   +/- 6\%, almost a 4-fold increase over untreated infestations. This
   suggests that by altering the dispersal patterns of beetles, the
   cut-and-leave suppression tactic map favor increased densities of flying
   beetles, and possibly more infested timber, in the surrounding region.
   Effective control of mobile pests may be enhanced by expanding our
   spatial scope and seeking to maximize the area-wide, not just the local,
   efficacy of management tactics.}},

Abstract = {{Southwest metropolitan Mexico City children are repeatedly exposed to
   high levels of a complex mixture of air pollutants, including ozone,
   particulate matter, aldehydes, metals, and nitrogen oxides. We explored
   nasal cell 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a major mutagenic
   lesion producing G-->T transversion mutations, using an
   immunohistochemical method, and DNA single strand breaks (ssb) using the
   single cell gel electrophoresis assay as biomarkers of oxidant exposure.
   Nasal biopsies from the posterior inferior turbinate were examined in
   children in grades one through five, including 12 controls from a
   low-polluted coastal town and 87 Mexico City children. Each biopsy was
   divided for the 8-OHdG and DNA ssb assays. There was an age-dependent
   increase in the percentage of nasal cells with DNA tails > 10 mu m in
   Mexico City children: 19 +/- 9\% for control cells, and 43 +/- 4, 50 +/-
   16, 56 +/- 17, 60 +/- 17 and 73 +/- 14\%, respectively, for first
   through fifth graders (p < 0.05). Nasal ssb were significantly higher in
   fifth graders than in first graders (p < 0.05). Higher levels (2.3- to
   3-fold) of specific nuclear staining for 8-OHdG were observed in exposed
   children as compared to controls (p < 0.05). These results suggest that
   DNA damage is present in nasal epithelial cells in Mexico City children.
   Persistent oxidative DNA damage may ultimately result in a selective
   growth of preneoplastic nasal initiated cells in this population and the
   potential for nasal neoplasms may increase with age. The combination of
   8-OHdG and DNA ssb should be useful for monitoring oxidative damage in
   people exposed to polluted atmospheres.}},

Abstract = {{The Mayak Production Association was the first Russian site for the
   production and separation of plutonium. The extensive increase in
   plutonium production during 1948-1955, as well as the absence of
   reliable waste-management technology, resulted in significant releases
   of liquid radioactive effluent into the rather small Techa River. This
   resulted in chronic external and internal exposure of about 30,000
   residents of riverside communities; these residents form the cohort of
   an epidemiologic investigation. Analysis of the available historical
   monitoring data indicates that the following reliable data sets can be
   used for reconstruction of doses received during the early periods of
   operation of the Mayak Production Association: Temporal pattern of
   specific beta activity of river water for several sites in the upper
   Techa region since July 1951; average annual values of specific beta
   activity of river water and bottom sediments as a function of downstream
   distance for the whole river since 1951; external gamma-exposure rates
   near the shoreline as a function of downstream distance for the whole
   Techa River since 1952; and external gamma-exposure rate as a function
   of distance from the shoreline for several sites in the upper and middle
   Techa since 1951.}},

Abstract = {{Growth, biomass and production of one year old mussels (Mytilus edulis
   L.) were monitored in mussel raft systems over a 15 month experimental
   period in Loch Etive (LE) and Loch Kishorn (LK) on the west coast of
   Scotland. Water temperature, salinity, seston, particulate organic
   matter and chlorophyll a were also determined. Salinity, amount of
   seston and transparency were significantly higher in LK than LE
   (p<0.05). Results showed that growth of mussels was relatively rapid
   from May to November and very slow during the rest of the year. Length
   increments were similar in both sites with 31.01 mm in LE and 28.75 mm
   in LK. Mussels reached market size (> 50 mm) about two years after spat
   settlement. The mean specific growth rate was 5.5\% in LE and 4.5\% in
   LK. Live weight was significantly higher in LE while tissue weight was
   higher in LK (p<0.05) and this was attributed to heavier shell weight in
   LE. Tissue growth showed a clear seasonal trend, increasing during late
   spring and summer and decreasing in the winter. The monthly mortality
   was 9.1\% in LE and 9.3\% in LK. There were high fluctuations in biomass
   between sampling months, and significant differences between sites at
   the end of the experimental period (p<0.001). The apparent positive
   relationships between specific growth rate and temperature and salinity
   in LE, and temperature in LK, indicate that these are two main factors
   controlling growth when food is available in both sites.}},

Title = {{Long-term harvesting and male migration in a New Zealand population of
   Himalayan tahr Hemitragus jemlahicus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{1. Sexual differences in behaviour and ecology have important
   implications for the management of harvested ungulate populations.
   2. This study investigated the long-term effects of harvesting on the
   abundance and distribution of sexes within an introduced population of
   Himalayan tahr in the Two Thumb and Sibbald Ranges, New Zealand. Annual
   counts of tahr were made from 1984 to 1996 in two catchments subject to
   different harvest regimes.
   3. Although populations in the two catchments increased at similar rates
   over the study period, their adult sex ratios diverged significantly in
   the late 1980s. In Carneys Creek, which was subject to unrestricted
   harvest, the adult sex ratio was initially equivalent to the estimated
   population sex ratio, but from 1991 it was significantly male-biased. In
   North Branch, 10 km from Carneys Creek but subject only to adult
   (trophy) male harvest, the population was significantly female-biased in
   all years.
   4. There was a large and male-biased harvest in Carneys Creek in 1993,
   suggesting that immigration of males may have been responsible for the
   long-term changes in sex ratio observed there. In contrast, the harvest
   of males in North Branch was insufficient to explain its female-biased
   population.
   5. Monthly counts of male and female tahr in Carneys Creek between
   December 1993 and February 1996 revealed a consistent seasonal change in
   the abundance of subadult males, and perhaps adult males, but not
   females. Sub-adult males immigrated into Carneys Creek during spring,
   increasing to a summer maximum before emigrating during autumn; few
   sub-adult males were present during winter.
   6. Counts at six additional sites during summer and autumn 1996
   indicated that the probable source of these males was an adjacent
   hunting reserve. This hunting reserve, which included North Branch,
   contained a female-biased population with moderate female density.
   7. The observed changes appear to have been a consequence of sexual
   differences in habitat selection and mobility. In particular, outside
   the rut the larger-bodied males avoided habitats containing high
   densities of females.
   8. Harvesting has the potential to affect the spatial distribution of
   age-sex classes for sexually dimorphic ungulates. Managers need to
   consider these effects when designing and interpreting harvest and
   monitoring programmes.}},

Abstract = {{During experiments in our laboratory to assess the progression and
   severity of gas bubble trauma (GBT) in juvenile spring chinook salmon
   Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, we had the opportunity to assess the influence
   of Renibacterium salmoninarum (Rs), the causative agent of bacterial
   kidney disease, on the susceptibility of salmon to GBT. We exposed fish
   with an established infection of Rs to 120\% total dissolved gas (TDG)
   for 96 h and monitored severity of GET signs in the fins and gills, Rs
   infection level in kidneys by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA), and mortality. Mortality occurred rapidly after exposure to
   120\% TDG, with a LT2O (time necessary to kill 20\% of the population)
   of about 37 h, which is at a minimum about 16\% earlier than other
   bioassays we have conducted using fish that had no apparent signs of
   disease. Fish that died early (from 31 to 36 h and from 49 to 52 h) had
   significantly higher infection levels (mean +/- SE ELISA absorbance =
   1.532 +/- 0.108) than fish that survived for 96 h (mean +/- SE ELISA
   absorbance = 0.828 +/- 0.137). Fish that died early also had a
   significantly greater number of gill filaments occluded with bubbles
   than those that survived 96 h. Conversely, fish that survived for 96 h
   had a significantly higher median fin severity ranking than those that
   died early. Our results indicate that fish with moderate to high levels
   of Rs infection are more vulnerable to the effects of dissolved gas
   supersaturation (DGS) and die sooner than fish with lower levels of Rs
   infection. However, there is a substantial amount of individual
   variation in susceptibility to the apparent cumulative effects of DGS
   and Rs infection. Collectively, our findings have important implications
   to programs designed to monitor the prevalence and severity of GBT in
   juvenile salmonids in areas like the Columbia River basin, and perhaps
   elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{1 An experiment was carried out in a species-poor acid grassland to
   determine the effect of insect, mollusc and rabbit herbivory on the size
   and composition of the seed bank and on seedling recruitment from the
   seed bank and seed rain. From 1991 to 1997, insects and molluscs were
   excluded with pesticides, and rabbits with fences. Seedling recruitment
   was monitored over 22 months in gaps established in the vegetation in
   summer 1995.
   2 The most common species recorded from the seed bank in early summer
   1995 were dicots (17 species), but perennial grasses (five species) were
   numerically the most abundant (65\% of total). There was no relationship
   between the species composition of the seed bank and the established
   vegetation.
   3 The size of the seed bank of eight species was greater on fenced
   plots, a result that reflected increased seed rain where rabbits were
   excluded. Insects and molluscs had no effect on the size of the seed
   bank of any species. The number of species in the seed bank was not
   affected by any of the herbivore exclusions.
   4 A comparison of seedling emergence in gaps formed over the original
   soil with gaps where the soil had been sterilized indicated that only
   Galium saxatile and Cytisus scoparius recruited fi-om the seed bank.
   Seedling recruitment was almost entirely derived from the recent seed
   rain, was dominated by the most abundant perennial grasses in the
   vegetation (Festuca rubra and Holcus lanatus), and had a species
   composition that resembled the established vegetation. Results highlight
   that the potential for seedling establishment in gaps to bring about
   vegetation change in this grassland is low.
   5 Six species had higher seedling densities on rabbit-fenced plots, but
   the significant effect of fencing disappeared by plant maturity for most
   species. Survival of seedlings was lower on fenced plots where
   non-grazed biomass accumulated, so that after 22 months Agrostis
   capillar is was the only species with more plants present where rabbits
   were excluded. Rumex acetosa and Stellaria graminea showed higher
   seedling emergence where molluscs were excluded. More seedlings of Rumex
   acetosa were also found where insects were excluded. These invertebrate
   effects were still evident at plant maturity.}},

Abstract = {{The balsam twig aphid, Mindarus abietinus Koch, causes distortion, loss,
   or both, of needles on balsam iir Christmas trees. Insecticides are
   often applied for control of twig aphids with little monitoring of
   population levels or their subsequent damage. This study compared the
   utility of 2 techniques (beating discs and visual counts of infested
   shoots) that could easily be used by Christmas tree growers to monitor
   aphids. A beating technique was better than visual counts for detecting
   numbers of fundatrices before and during budbreak, whereas visual counts
   of midcrown infested shoots were more feasible for estimating aphid
   abundance after budbreak. Sample size analysis indicated that a minimum
   of 15 trees could be used for either method to estimate mean numbers of
   fundatrices or mean proportions of potentially infested shoots.
   Correlation analyses between mean numbers of aphids or proportions of
   infested shoots and resulting proportions of undamaged shoots were
   variable with a significant and negative correlation between infested
   shoots and subsequent undamaged shoots (r = -0.83). Paired comparisons
   were also made between selected and nonselected Choose-and-Cut Christmas
   trees to evaluate public perception of aphid damage. The public did not
   differentiate between aphid-damaged and undamaged trees, but they did
   show a preference for larger trees. Our results indicate that growers
   need to monitor aphids before budbreak and limit insecticide
   applications to trees with predictable levels of infestation (e.g., 2 or
   more fundatrices per disc results in approximate to 50\% infested
   shoots) that will be harvested for shipment rather than grown for
   Choose-and-Cut.}},

Abstract = {{The citrus bud mite, Aceria sheldoni (Ewing), has a reputation as being
   a serious pest of lemons in California, although recent studies failed
   to reveal a consistent economic impact. To resolve some previous
   inconsistencies, we evaluated the economic value of treatments to
   suppress citrus bud mite populations on a commercial scale over 3yr.
   Experiments were conducted in 6 groves and included 2 treatments of 100
   trees each. In 1 treatment (treated), trees were managed according to
   conventional commercial practices and included 1-2 annual applications
   of narrow-range oil to suppress citrus bud mite populations. In the
   other treatment (untreated), experimental trees were managed identically
   as treated trees, except that oil spray applications for citrus but mite
   were withheld. Bud mite density and incidence on experimental trees were
   monitored monthly, as were the number of fruit and the proportion of
   distorted fruit. Fruit from all 100 trees in each treatment per grove
   were commercially harvested, graded and packed. Crop volume, grade, size
   distribution, and value were compared across treatments. Although oil
   sprays effectively suppressed citrus bud mite populations, this yielded
   no consistent benefit to crop volume, grade, or value. For all groves,
   the value of fruit from treated trees was not significantly greater than
   that from untreated trees, even before the cost of oil sprays was
   subtracted. In 4 of 6 cases, crop value was numerically lower in the
   treated treatment. Results suggest that the oil sprays themselves may
   have had deleterious effects on fruit initiation and abortion, The
   potential phytotoxicity of oil sprays, although long known, may not be
   fully considered in contemporary treatment decisions for the citrus bud

Abstract = {{The disruption of the endocrine systems of gastropod molluscs and
   consequential physiological changes (imposex and intersex) are used as
   biomarkers for environmental contamination by tributyltin compounds. The
   first international laboratory performance study on the determination of
   imposer and intersex in neogastropod molluscs, Nucella lapillus and
   Littorina littorea has been undertaken by the QUASIMEME (Quality
   Assurance of Information for Marine Environmental Monitoring in Europe)
   project. Samples of live gastropods were distributed and participants
   were asked to record shell height and sex, together with penis length
   and vas deferens sequence stage (VDS) in Nucella or the intersex stage
   (IS) and prostate length in Littorina. Calculations were made of vas
   deferens sequence index (VDSI) and the relative penis size index (RPSI)
   in Nucella and of intersex stage index (ISI) and the average female
   prostate length (FPrL) in Littorina. Thirteen (87\%) of the 15
   participating laboratories returned data. The remaining two laboratories
   asked to participate in later exercises. For Nucella, seven laboratories
   reported sex ratios significantly different from the reference
   laboratory data. Differences in penis length measurements between
   laboratories were largely random, although there were indications of
   systematic errors affecting the data from three laboratories. Seven
   laboratories reported satisfactory data (Z-score
   \textbackslash{}Z\textbackslash{} < 2)for VDSI. The inclusion of a high
   proportion of sub-adults in the Nucella samples may have made separation
   of the sexes more difficult than in mature adults. The sub-adults will
   have had smaller pene than mature adults in the same population, and
   therefore any errors (random or systematic) in the measurement of penis
   length or observation of reproductive organs would have a potentially
   greater impact on the final reported values of the summary imposer
   indices. The Littorina sample did not show a high degree of intersex
   (ISI = 0.41). The laboratories could determine the sex of Littorina
   reliably and only one laboratory reported data significantly different
   from the reference laboratory. All except two laboratories reported
   satisfactory data for ISI.}},

Abstract = {{Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii Woloszynska is a prominent constituent of
   a number of water bodies in northern Australia. In Solomon Dam, this
   species occurs as two distinct morphological forms, one with straight
   trichomes and one with coiled trichomes, Isolates of the two forms have
   been grown in pure culture and have been shown to maintain their
   respective characteristic form over successive generations. Both forms
   were similar with respect to cylindrospermopsin content expressed as a
   percentage of freeze-dried culture material, ranging from 0.14\% to
   0.20\%, depending on the N source provided in the medium, A
   morphological comparison between natural populations of the two forms
   showed significant differences in vegetative, heterocyst, and akinete
   cell dimensions, These characteristics are the primary taxonomic
   criteria at the species level in this genus. In culture, the coiled form
   grew slightly faster than the straight form over the range of conditions
   investigated in this study. The coiled form was better suited to growth
   under low-light conditions. These clear and consistent morphological and
   physiological differences contrast with the 99.8\% similarity between
   the two forms in their 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequences. It is
   concluded that although taxonomic separation of the two forms at the
   species level might not be warranted, the two strains investigated are
   clearly distinct morphotypes, and it is recommended that they be so
   recorded in monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{We studied Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in the afro-alpine area
   (elevation 3500-4000 m) of the Bale Mountains in Ethiopia. We monitored
   seven territories from 1-5 successive years for a total of 26
   territory-years. Home ranges varied from only 1.5-9 km(2), the smallest
   size recorded for the species. This was probably due to the abundance of
   prey, mainly hares and grass rats, that made up 50\% and 30\% of prey,
   respectively. Despite this, productivity of these Golden Eagles was
   quite low averaging only 0.28 young per occupied territory (N = 25).
   This was due to a large number of unmated territorial adults and poor
   bleeding performance by pairs (0.4 young per pair per year, N = 17). The
   high density and frequent interspecific interactions with Verreaux's
   Eagles (Aquila verreauxii) were key factors affecting the dynamics of
   this Golden Eagle population. The unusual coexistence of these two
   closely related species was a novel component of the rich predator guild
   in the area that included five other wintering or resident eagle
   species. This richness was related to the high density of rodents and
   lagomorphs, a characteristic of the Ethiopian afro-alpine ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Paralytic shellfish toxin profiles of Alexandrium tamarense (Lebour)
   Balech and mussels (Aulacomya ater) contaminated by the dinoflagellate,
   were obtained from eight sampling stations along the Valdes Peninsula,
   Chubut, Argentina. The samples were collected from November 1995 to May
   1996. The data show, that the monitoring began after an outbreak during
   a bloom of A. tamarense. The highest cell densities were found in
   November 1995 at Bengoa (1.81 x 10(3) cells/L) and Larralde (1.2 x 10(3)
   cells/L), both stations are located in the San Jose Gulf. Occurrence of
   other species of phytoplankton are also reported. A. tamarense was never
   more than 2\% of the total phytoplankton population. Low temperatures
   and high salinity were found in November 1995, when the highest A.
   tamarense cell density was observed. Using a postcolumn derivatization
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, the PSP toxin
   profiles of Patagonian coast phytoplankton and mussel samples were
   obtained for the first time. The average PSP toxin profile of over 30
   mussel samples from all monitoring stations showed the gonyautoxins 1-4
   (GTX 1-4) epimers to be the most abundant PSP toxins. These epimers were
   the most prevalent ones in the A. tamarense present in the phytoplankton
   samples analyzed. Other PSP toxins quantified in mussel samples were:
   STX, dcSTX, and C1-C4. NeoSTX was never found in mussel or phytoplankton
   samples. The highest toxicity in the phytoplankton samples was 490 fmol
   of PSP toxins/cell and mussels 631 mu g STX eq./100 g, both of which
   were obtained in November, 1995. The decrease of the toxicity in the
   filter feeder Aulacomya ater, occurs following an exponential decay of
   the first order, showing that, in the San Jase Gulf Valdes Peninsula,
   the natural depuration process of A. ater can be interpreted by a
   one-compartment model. According to the detoxification rate determined
   for A. ater, a native South American filter-feeder bivalve, can be
   classified as a moderate detoxifier.}},

Abstract = {{In order to monitor spawning success in earthen ponds, individual
   channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus broodfish were identified prior to
   stocking by genotype analysis with polymorphic microsatellite DNA
   markers. Individual spawns were collected and reared in a hatchery, and
   eight sac-fry per spawn were sampled for genotype analysis. Mendelian
   inheritance of microsatellite alleles was used to identify parents of
   each spawn. The probability of detecting a falsely matched offspring and
   spawning pair was >99\%. Average spawning success was 44\% (17-80\%).
   Multiple spawning by males was found in seven of the eight ponds
   sampled. In these ponds, 47\% of the males fertilized 2-6 egg masses
   over 1-8 wk, although most were 2-3 wk apart. Four different spawns were
   identified as two full-sib families and were probably due to interrupted
   spawning. Parent/offspring genotype analysis will be useful for
   production of half-sib families for estimation of genetic components of
   variation, estimation of effective breeding population, and selection of
   broodstock for multiple reproductive traits under natural spawning
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, there have been significant declines in Brown
   Hare Lepus europaeus numbers throughout Europe, leading to concern for
   their status in many countries. In Britain, there were no quantified
   data on the extent of this decline, on current population levels, or any
   baseline against which to monitor future population changes. The need
   for a quantified national hare survey led to this evaluation of the
   techniques available to assess hare numbers. Published information on
   counting hares is reviewed, and various techniques compared by applying
   them to a number of sites in southern England.
   Three basic approaches are available: counts of inactive hares, counts
   of active hares and indirect methods. Counts of inactive hares include
   total clearance, wide belt and line transect counts. Total clearance
   counts give an absolute figure, but are labour intensive and can only be
   applied to restricted areas. Wide-belt assessments are difficult to
   apply in certain habitats and even in open areas tend to produce a
   substantial over-estimate. Line transect counts are easy to undertake
   and are not labour intensive but should only be applied to large areas,
   or data from several small areas combined. Counts based on active hares
   are more problematical, because it is difficult to determine what
   proportion of the population is inactive at any one time. Spotlight
   counts based on variable circular plots are the most accurate but
   difficult to apply widely, and twilight counts are very subjective in
   their interpretation, especially when surveying small areas or areas
   with a large proportion of concealing habitats. Of the indirect methods,
   dung pellet counts can be valuable in specific areas but are difficult
   to apply across a range of habitats.
   We concluded that, of the various techniques considered, line transect
   counts have the greatest potential for a national survey, but need to be
   stratified so that enough transects are undertaken within each habitat
   stratum to obtain a reliable mean population estimate for each stratum.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial assemblage- and population-level variables were assessed at
   five sites along the Cuyahoga River in Northeastern Ohio during three
   seasons. Assemblage-level parameters (total, culturable, and
   lactose-positive bacteria) increased in a downstream direction during
   spring when discharge was elevated. Population-level responses were
   examined using colony hybridization with species-specific probes for
   Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomonas putida. Also a group-specific probe
   for the gamma-proteobacteria was used to monitor the abundance of this
   widespread bacterial taxon. Abundances of culturable individuals of
   these taxa exhibited spatio-temporal differences; patterns typically
   were different from those observed for assemblage-level parameters.
   Seasonal changes in the abundances of these taxa were frequently large;
   for example, in winter and spring the y-proteobacteria represented 20 to
   80\% of the colony forming units (CFU) while in summer this group
   accounted for 5\% or less of the CFU. Likewise, B. cepacia populations
   peaked in spring and became nearly undetectable in summer.
   Assemblage-level variations appeared to often mask population dynamics.
   These changes in bacterial populations imply that studies designed to
   monitor abundances for bioremediation or ecological purposes: 1) must
   account for seasonal blooms of bacteria of different species and 2)
   consider documentation of bacterial populations to detect more sensitive
   environmental responses.}},

Abstract = {{Correlations between breeding date and the life history or energy stores
   of individuals might stem from a combination of two different
   mechanisms. The conventional view is that individual size and condition
   influence breeding date (i.e., condition dependence), a different view
   is that heritable maturation schedules allow temporally separated
   population components to adapt to selective regimes associated with
   particular breeding times (i.e., adaptation-by-time). Considering each
   of these hypotheses. we examined a population of sockeye salmon
   (Oncorhynchus nerka) for evidence of correlations among life history
   traits (age, body size, egg size, and reproductive life span). patterns
   of energy allocation (somatic energy stores and gonadal investment), and
   breeding date. Life history traits were measured for 705 individually
   tagged adult salmon monitored from the onset of breeding until death.
   Energy stores were quantified for 60 fish collected when they entered
   the stream and 46 fish collected at death.
   Multiple repression models revealed that most of the variation could be
   explained by simple linear relationships among traits: older fish were
   larger, and larger fish haj. larger gonads, larger eggs, and more
   available energy when they started breeding. Condition dependence did
   not appear relevant to breeding date because fish that started breeding
   early were similar in size and did not have more stored energy than fish
   that would breed later. Similarly. adaptation-by-time had little
   influence on variation in body size or egg size (predicted relationships
   a ere significant but very weak). In contrast, adaptation-by-time
   appeared very important to variation in reproductive life span and
   patterns of energy allocation. Early-breeding fish lived considerably
   longer than late-breeding fish (females, R(2) = 0.525; males, R(2) =
   0.533). This pattern arose because late-breeding fish expended more
   energy before breeding, and because late-breeding females invested more
   energy into egg production and retained less for metabolism during
   breeding. Adaptation-by-time may play an important role in life history
   evolution within some species, particularly those with breeding systems
   characterised by semelparity. capital breeding, and heritable breeding
   times.}},

Abstract = {{Pycnotropis tida (Chamberlin, 1941) (Diplopoda, Aphelidesmidae) inhabits
   mixed- and whitewater inundation forests from the upper to the central
   Amazon Basin (Nauta/Peru-Manaus/Brazil) as well as a non-flooded upland
   forest at Manaus. This polydesmidan species is capable of populating
   inundation forests despite the adverse living conditions i.e., annual
   flooding of up to 7 months duration and low relative humidity on the
   bark of tree trunks, where adults pass the aquatic phase. The
   development of immature stadia takes 7 months and therefore P. tida
   cannot inhabit forests with more than 5 months flooding. Fresh weight in
   adult P. tida varied, depending on the collection site (inundation and
   upland forests). Females were generally heavier than males. In the
   laboratory, longevity in adults from an upland forest was higher
   compared to animals from inundation forests, regardless of both
   temperature and sex. The highest number of mature eggs, monitored in
   females of inundation forests throughout the year, was found at the end
   of the aquatic phase (n less than or equal to 605). Highly variable
   numbers of eggs and and ovipositions reflect the instability of the
   environment. The seasonal phenology observed in the univoltine P. tida
   from inundation forests is caused by the flood pulse,: as the juveniles
   cannot survive or escape flooding. The populations from non-flooded
   upland forests are plurivoltine, with terricolous immatures and adults
   occurring throughout the year. The origin of P tida in seasonal upland
   forests of the Western Andes and its propagation downstream of the
   Solimoes/Amazon River is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring conducted in French vineyards since 1994 led to detection of
   three anilinopyrimidine-resistant phenotypes in field populations of
   Botrytis cinerea (Botryotinia fuckeliana). A few strains were highly
   resistant to anilinopyrimidines (e.g., pyrimethanil) only and were named
   Ani(R1). Analysis of tetrads obtained from crosses between Ani(R1) and
   sensitive strains (Ani(s)) showed that one major gene is probably
   involved in the Ani(R1) phenotype. The resistance mechanism has not yet
   been elucidated but the Ani(R1) strains did not seem to display a
   reduced accumulation of {[}C-14]pyrimethanil in their mycelium. We also
   distinguished two different patterns of cross-resistance, named Ani(R2)
   and Ani(R3) phenotypes. Both were weakly resistant to
   anilinopyrimidines, highly resistant to tolnaftate, a squalene epoxidase
   inhibitor (used only in medicine), and appeared less sensitive to
   dicarboximides (e.g., iprodione). Moreover, Ani(R2) strains were weakly
   resistant to phenylpyrroles (e.g., fludioxonil) while Ani(R3) strains
   displayed a slight decrease of sensitivity to sterol C14-demethylation
   inhibitors (e.g., prochloraz, tebuconazole) and to the experimental
   hydroxyanilide fenhexamid. Genetic analysis showed that there is no
   disjunction of multiple resistances in ascospore progenies and we found
   a 1:1 segregation of sensitive:resistant phenotypes, suggesting that
   Ani(R2) and Ani(R3) phenotypes are each probably encoded by a single
   major gene. Studies on the uptake of {[}C-14]pyrimethanil did not show
   any difference between the sensitive and the resistant strains. However,
   the addition of fluazinam, an uncoupler, led to an accumulation of the
   fungicide in mycelium, suggesting that an active efflux occurred.
   Experiments carried out on the uptake of {[}C-14]tebuconazole and
   {[}C-14]triadimenol, two sterol C14-demethylation inhibitors, showed a
   lower accumulation of these fungicides in mycelium of resistant strains
   than in sensitive strains. The effect of fluazinam demonstrated that
   this phenomenon was correlated with an energy-dependent efflux, which
   seemed to be inducible in sensitive strains and constitutive in
   resistant strains and could be a multidrug resistance mechanism. (C)1999

Abstract = {{The pattern of organophosphate resistance in field populations of
   Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) was monitored in Pakistan from 1994
   through 1997 using an IRAC leaf-dip method. Generally, moderate to high
   resistance was found to an orthophosphorate, monocrotophos and to a
   dithiophosphorate, ethion. Resistance to the commonly used
   thiophosphorates, chlorpyrifos and profenofos, was very low during 1994
   and 1995 but showed an upward trend during 1996 and 1997. Resistance
   factors to the other thiophosphorates such as quinalphos,
   parathion-methyl, methamidophos and triazophos remained very low.
   Baseline lethal concentrations for ethion, methamidophos and triazophos
   were at least four to five times higher than those for the other
   organophosphates tested, suggesting their low intrinsic efficacy against
   H armigera. (C) 1999 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of shrubs in a winter-rainfall (ca. 70 mm yr(-1)) desert
   community (Succulent Karoo), dominated by leaf succulents, showed
   remarkable dynamics over a 17-yr period. After a severe drought in 1979,
   which caused high plant mortality, perennial species number in a
   permanent 10 m x 10 m plot doubled between 1980 and 1996, when the
   maximum of 41 species was recorded. Numbers of individuals of evergreen,
   leaf succulent shrubs also doubled over the same period, but showed
   fluctuations in response to dry years during the monitoring period.
   Detailed observations on the four dominant leaf succulent shrubs (all
   members of the Mesembryanthemaceae) between 1983 and 1996, showed
   species-specific patterns in population turnover. Mortality of all
   observed individuals ranged between 60\% and 85\%, and the proportion of
   the population that was recruited over this period ranged from 62\% to
   89\%. In only one species did individuals persist throughout the
   monitoring period. Mean ages of individuals, excluding seedlings with
   lifespans of < 1 yr, and individuals observed at the beginning of the
   monitoring period, ranged from 4.6 yr to 5.6 yr. Patterns of mortality
   and recruitment showed substantial differences among species and were
   not all attributable to rainfall patterns. Overall, the turnover of the
   shrub populations over the 15-yr monitoring period was remarkably high
   for a system of desert perennials. These unusual population patterns may
   explain the unique structure of leaf succulent-dominated communities in
   the Succulent Karoo.}},

Abstract = {{Port Lockroy, situated on the Antarctic Peninsula, is one of the most
   visited tourist sites in Antarctica. The effects of visitor disturbance
   on the breeding performance of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at
   Goudier Island, Port Lockroy was investigated during the austral summer
   of 1996/1997 by comparing pairs in treatment areas (visited by 35-55
   tourists every 12 days) and control colonies (not visited by tourists).
   There were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of
   birds that laid, in hatching success or the proportion of single-chick
   broods. Pairs in treatment colonies laid a higher proportion of
   single-egg clutches, but this was related to colony location and
   unusually high snow accumulation. Most treatment colonies were situated
   on low-lying ground or in the lee of buildings, and probably had more
   late layers at the initial census. Only 11\% of tourist visits had
   occurred by laying, making human disturbance an unlikely explanation for
   the higher proportion of single-egg clutches. Nests monitored in a
   disturbed colony and a control colony showed no differences in chick
   mass or survival up to 20 days of age. The overall breeding success,
   based on counts of creched birds, was similar to other southern
   populations of gentoo penguins, after correcting for mortality between
   creching and fledging. Historical data from Goudier Island indicate that
   the colony established itself in 1985 and has rapidly increased in size
   since then. The neighbouring colony at Alice Creek, which has been
   regularly visited by tourists for at least a decade, has also shown a
   population increase, although this expansion has been at a slower rate.
   We conclude that disturbance from tourist visits is unlikely to have
   been a major determinant of gentoo population change at Port Lockroy.}},

Abstract = {{Aphia minuta (Risso, 1810) is by far the most common pelagic gobiid of
   the Adriatic Sea and it is seasonally exploited by some local
   small-scale fishing fleets. Despite this, very few data on its biology
   in this area have been reported to date. Accordingly, age and growth of
   A. minuta were investigated by counting microincrements (daily rings) in
   the sagittal otoliths of 262 specimens caught in the central Adriatic
   between May 1996 and March 1997. Age of fish from 14 to 55 mm total
   length ranged between 42 and 275 days, confirming the short life span of
   this species. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated by the
   age-length data pairs for the whole population were: L-infinity = 68.7
   mm; K = 1.55 year(-1); t(0) = 0.077 year. The analysis of the monthly
   length-frequency distributions showed the simultaneous presence in late
   spring-early summer of two main cohorts which, together with the
   back-calculated hatch date distribution, indicated a more extended
   spawning period than previously reported in the literature. Because the
   fishery for A. minuta in the central Adriatic exploits the spawning
   stock it should be monitored and, if necessary, regulated.}},

Abstract = {{The response to different levels of metal pollution by assemblages of
   microbenthic algae and bacteria was investigated in a lowland stream.
   Colonized glass-discs and samples of natural assemblages on coarse sand
   were used to test zinc tolerance. Tolerance was characterized by
   measuring inhibition of C-14-incorporation in microalgae and inhibition
   of H-3-thymidine incorporation in bacteria. Bacterial assemblages on
   both glass and sand from a high zinc and cadmium site were resistant to
   zinc when compared to populations from a cleaner upstream site. Algae
   from the strongly polluted site were only slightly affected by the
   highest test concentrations of zinc, in contrast to other algal
   communities. A change towards metal tolerant bacteria and algae was
   indicated and seems to occur despite the strong binding of metals by
   precipitates of iron hydroxide and organic deposits in the biofilm. The
   observations were compared with published data on short-term and long
   term zinc toxicity in algae and bacteria. The gradual changes in micro-
   and macrobenthos under high metal loads is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{From the 1970s to the 1990s, changes in breeding waterfowl populations
   were monitored at 26 well-vegetated lakes in southern Finland. Extreme
   total population levels were found to differ by 40\%, but between
   successive years fluctuations did not exceed 20\%, the most unstable
   populations being garganey Anas querquedula, tufted duck Aythya
   fuligula, coot Fulica atra and pochard Aythya ferina. Multiple
   regression analysis was used to determine the effects of weather factors
   during wintering, spring and brood seasons on the variation in breeding
   waterfowl populations. The following weather factors were statistically
   significant in explaining fluctuations observed in four species; in
   garganey: spring temperature; in pintail Anas acuta: brood season
   temperature, winter severity in France and spring temperature; in
   goldeneye Bucephala clangula: winter severity in the Baltic and spring
   temperature; and in mallard Anas platyrhynchos: brood season temperature
   of the previous year. Mallard, teal Anas crecca, wigeon Anas penelope
   and goldeneye were shot in larger numbers than would be expected
   considering their respective proportions of the breeding waterfowl
   community. Hunting pressure on mallard, tufted duck and goldeneye was
   clearly higher in our study area than in other parts of Finland. Our
   results indicate that the level of hunting pressure in our study area
   may affect population densities of mallard.}},

Abstract = {{Ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) populations have been
   surveyed extensively throughout the Midwest for several decades. For
   pheasants, mean brood size provides a measure of annual recruitment.
   Regressing mean brood size on year from population surveys conducted in
   9 Midwestern states and 25 regions within 5 states, we found that mean
   brood size increased on surveys in Nebraska (P<0.001) and declined in
   Illinois (P<0.001), Minnesota (P=0.004), North Dakota (P=0.001), South
   Dakota (P=0.01), and Wisconsin (P<0.001). Mean brood size increased on
   surveys in 6 of 6 regions in Nebraska (P less than or equal to 0.057)
   and declined in 1 of 5 regions in Iowa (P less than or equal to 0.022),
   2 of 5 regions in Kansas (P less than or equal to 0.045), 2 of 6 regions
   in Minnesota (P less than or equal to 0.058), and 1 of 3 regions in
   North Dakota (P=0.008). Averaging mean brood size among 10-year survey
   intervals, we found that the change in mean brood size occurred more
   specifically between 1956 and 1965 and 1976 and 1985 in Illinois
   (P<0.001), 1962 and 1971 and 1972 and 1981 in Iowa (P<0.001), 1960 and

Abstract = {{Indigenous populations of the North America river otter (Lontra
   canadensis) were extirpated from Indiana by 1942. To initiate a
   statewide restoration program, 25 otters (15M:10F) from Louisiana were
   released at Muscatatuck National Wildlife Refuge in southern Indiana. We
   evaluated their post-release survival, movements, and reproductive
   activity using radiotelemetry with 15 animals (9M:6F), field surveys,
   and observations for >1 year. Cause of death for 4 radiotransmittered
   otters (2M:2F) and 1 non-radiotransmittered male included collisions
   with vehicles (n=3), research-related factors (n=1), and unknown causes
   (n=1). Survival for radiotransmittered otters was 71\% during the first
   year following release. We monitored 14 otters (8M:6F) for 235.1+/-112.9
   days and obtained 1,218 radio locations ((x) over bar=87.0/otter; range
   24-144). Adaptive kernel home ranges averaged 35.1 (SD=26.4), 10.9
   (SD=8.0), and 3.0 (SD=2.6) km(2) for the 95\%, 75\%, and 50\%
   utilization distributions, respectively. Otters dispersed an average of
   2.8+/-1.5 km, but distance traveled did not differ between sexes. Twelve
   of 15 otters known to have survived >100 days established 50\% core
   areas on the refuge or adjacent waterways. Extensive intrasexual ((x)
   over bar=59\% between males; (x) over bar=36\% between females) and
   intersexual overlap ((x) over bar=48\%) of these areas, sightings of
   otter groups, and concurrent use of common den sites suggest a high
   degree of post-release interaction among radiotransmittered animals.
   Recruitment was not confirmed in the first year, but 3 litters were
   documented in the second reproductive season after release. Data
   obtained since this study indicate that otters persist in the release
   area and have expanded to adjacent portions of the watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of deer responses to hunting pressure may affect the duration,
   intensity, and framework of hunt programs designed to maximize
   population reductions. We investigated the effects of archery hunting on
   deer movement and activity patterns in an urban-residential landscape.
   We compared deer activity, home-range size, shifts in diel core-area
   use, and fidelity to home ranges between hunted and unhunted deer before
   and during a 9-week archery hunt. We monitored 28 radiocollared does for
   a 24-hour period each week from April 1995 to December 1996. During the
   hunt, 4 of 5 hunted deer and 4 of 4 unhunted deer remained within their
   annual home range. Home-range size for hunted and unhunted deer was
   similar between the prehunt and hunt periods. However, clay home-range
   size expanded at least 3-fold for 2 of 5 hunted deer during the hunt
   compared to the prehunt period, presumably from increased human activity
   associated with hunting. We detected changes in deer movement patterns
   during the hunt within 2 weeks of the 9-week hunt. Significant shifts
   (<10\% overlap) in core-area use between the prehunt and hunt period
   occurred for 4 of 5 hunted deer during the day and 3 of 5 hunted deer
   during the night. There were no significant shifts in core-area use for
   unhunted deer between the prehunt and hunt periods. Three of 4 unhunted
   deer did not shift either their day or night core-area use between the
   prehunt and hunt periods. Collared deer killed during the hunt used the
   hunt zone more often during the prehunt period than collared deer
   surviving the hunt. Day use of the hunt zone by hunted deer was less
   during the hunt period than during the prehunt period. Night use of the
   hunt zone was similar between the prehunt and hunt periods. Archery
   hunting had no effect on home-range size. Although most deer exhibited a
   strong fidelity to annual home ranges throughout the 9-week hunt, deer
   shifted core-area use within home ranges. We suggest that a series of
   short, intense hunt periods, separated by periods of no hunting, may
   decrease deer responses to hunting pressure and increase vulnerability
   during the hunt.}},

Abstract = {{Attitudes and perceptions toward caribou (Rangifer tarandus) management
   practices held by users and managers of the Western Arctic Herd (WAH) in
   Alaska and the Beverly and Qamanirjuaq herds (BQH) in Canada were
   compared through structured interviews with both users and managers.
   Collection of population dynamics data received highest priority by
   managers in both Alaska and Canada, with aerial photocensuses,
   recruitment surveys, and calving-ground surveys emphasized. Alaskan
   managers also emphasized making natality and mortality surveys and
   plotting herd movements, whereas in Canada, range-use patterns, wildfire
   effects on movements, delineation of calving grounds, and access of
   caribou to traditional users are important in management. Differences in
   priorities to collect biological data to manage the WAH and the BQH
   resulted from the larger range for the BQH, complications of monitoring
   2 herds with overlapping ranges in Canada, somewhat greater funding and
   logistic resources available in Alaska, and the greater number of
   jurisdictions in Canada. Indigenous hunters, who are the primary users
   of the caribou of the WAH and the BQH, found herd monitoring practices
   used by managers, such as radiocollaring and aerial surveys, more
   acceptable in Alaska than in Canada. In Alaska, hunters indicated a
   greater willingness to accept restrictive hunting quotas, if they were
   to be imposed, than was the case in Canada. Managers are increasingly
   recognizing that indigenous knowledge has a role to play in caribou
   management; caribou users are including, with their traditional views of
   the ways of the caribou, information derived from biological
   investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Snags (standing dead trees) provide important habitat for forest
   wildlife, as well as a source of coarse woody debris important in forest
   succession. Because of their importance, some land-management agencies
   have standards for snag retention on lands under their jurisdiction
   (e.g. U.S. Forest Service, British Columbia Ministry of Forestry).
   Despite these guidelines, however, little information is typically
   available on snag numbers or dynamics on these lands. As part of a
   long-term effort to monitor snag dynamics, snag populations were sampled
   on 114 1-ha plots randomly located across six Ranger Districts on two
   National Forests in northern Arizona. Sixty plots were located in
   ponderosa pine forest, with the remainder in mixed-conifer forest. Small
   snags and snags in later decay classes numerically dominated snag
   populations. Because large snags are most useful to forest wildlife,
   this suggests a need to retain large trees as future snags. Only 6.7 and
   16.7\% of plots in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forest,
   respectively, met or exceeded current U.S. Forest Service standards for
   retention of large snags (defined as snags greater than or equal to 46
   cm in diameter at breast height and 9 m in height) in this geographic
   region. Even plots with no evidence of timber or fuelwood harvest seldom
   met targets for retention of large snags, however. Only 30 and 32\% of
   unlogged plots met or exceeded standards in ponderosa pine and
   mixed-conifer forest, respectively. This suggests that current standards
   for snag retention may be unrealistic, and that those standards may need
   to be reconsidered. Snag guidelines should be based on an understanding
   of both, snag dynamics and the requirements of snag-dependent wildlife
   species. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A survey conducted in 1995 investigated long term declines reported in a
   population of box turtles Terrapene carolina monitored each decade since
   1945 in bottomland hardwood forest at the Patuxent Wildlife Research
   Center, Maryland. Methods duplicated past surveys in most respects, but
   were supplemented by radiotelemetry and a survey of dominant vegetation.
   Seventy different turtles were found on the 11.8 ha study area, a
   decline of > 75\% since peak populations were recorded in 1955.
   Searchers were less efficient in 1995 than in 1945-1975 for a variety of
   possible reasons. Among turtles recorded, approximately equal numbers
   persisted from each of the past five decades, with some individuals
   surviving > 70 years. A sex ratio strongly favoring males was first
   recorded in 1975 and continued in 1995, but juveniles and subadults were
   found in greater proportion in 1995 than in any other survey. Six of
   nine radio-marked turtles left the bottomland study area and migrated to
   the adjoining bluffs to hibernate, suggesting more extensive movements
   and perhaps less stable home ranges than formerly thought. Age structure
   of trees indicated a gradual change to more shade-tolerant species.
   Examination of rates of change from survey data suggested that major
   losses probably resulted from changes in hydrology that exacerbated
   flooding in 1972, with recovery only beginning in 1995 and perhaps
   limited both by repeated flood events and successional changes in the
   forest. Slow recovery from losses may indicate that populations of this
   species would respond poorly to exploitation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) appears to show
   regular shore attendance in the form of seasonal oscillations. This
   phenomenon should be quantified to properly interpret counts of fur
   seals >1 year old (i.e., non-pups). Here we test the predictability of
   peaks in the annual shore-attendance oscillation on Otago Peninsula
   using an autoregressive sine model and >2 years of intensive survey
   data. We predicted that the peak in fur seal numbers ashore would lie
   between 14 January - 4 April (1996) and 8 January - 2 April (1997),
   although this low predictability is undesirable when attempts are made
   to monitor population trends. Estimating population size from counts of
   non-pups also requires knowledge of the rate of turnover of individuals.
   Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ragged animals from other
   colonies are immigrants to Otago Peninsula. With sightings on Otago
   Peninsula of fur seals tagged elsewhere in New Zealand, we used a Monte
   Carlo approach to simulate the expected frequency of single and multiple
   sightings of individuals. We found that the observed frequency of
   multiple sightings was significantly less than predicted by the model (P
   < 0.0001), indicating that tagged animals were transients. We also
   discovered that the sex ratio of tagged animals varied with breeding
   colony of origin (G(1) = 52.07, P < 0.0001), suggesting that the impetus
   for emigration differs among colonies. We concur with the view that
   counting pups is the only way to estimate the relative abundance of New
   Zealand fur seals. In addition, we showed that counts of non-pups cannot
   be used to estimate population size because an unknown proportion of
   individuals is transient. However, counting of pups does not address the
   issue of estimating relative abundance for locations with large numbers
   of nonbreeding individuals and few or no breeders. With few or no pups
   it is impossible to estimate relative abundance using counts of pups.}},

Abstract = {{We do not know whether the movements of irruptive migrants are
   fundamentally different from more conventional migration of birds to
   their wintering areas because irruptive migration has never been
   thoroughly described for any species on a continent-wide scale. We use
   data from a citizen-based monitoring program, Project FeederWatch, to
   describe the patterns of movements of redpolls (principally Carduelis
   flammea) across North America in 1993-1994, the winter of a major
   irruptive migration. Although redpolls moved into new areas during this
   irruptive migration, the normal wintering range was not completely
   abandoned. In fact, redpolls were more prevalent in the southern part of
   their normal wintering range in an irruption year than was typical in
   non-irruption years. There also was no indication that the majority of
   the North American population of redpolls moved continuously through the
   winter: although redpolls peaked in prevalence at different times across
   the continent, their spring departure was relatively synchronous across
   the entire continent. Group sizes were typically smaller the later
   redpolls arrived in a region, also suggesting that the entire redpoll
   population did not move continuously. in contrast to a non-irruptive
   migrant, the American Tree Sparrow (Spizella arborea), redpolls arrived
   at feeders in a given region later but reached peak densities more
   quickly. Our results suggest that the irruptive migration of redpolls is
   more allied to conventional winter migration than to nomadism.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic range and numbers of Buff-breasted Flycatchers (Empidonax
   fulvifrons) have decreased in Arizona in this century. We conducted
   surveys to locate additional populations, and studied habitat use in
   relation to availability, and reproductive success. Results suggested
   that some small populations have disappeared but that others have
   increased. We estimated reproductive success using an index based on
   adults' behavior. We found 67 Buff-breasted Flycatcher nests constructed
   by 44 pairs, Distance to opening was positively correlated with
   reproductive success rank, We compared used to available areas and nest
   sites to used areas and found that Buff-breasted Flycatchers inhabited
   areas dominated by pines, with a sparse oak understory. We found
   significant associations between Buff-boasted Flycatcher presence and
   vegetation type, structural stage. canopy cover, and forest patch width.
   We developed a habitat model to help manage this rare species, We
   recommend continued monitoring of Buff-breasted Flycatcher populations
   and creation of open pine forest with an open understory of oak. Fire
   may facilitate development of potential habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Constant-effort mist-netting has become an increasingly popular tool in
   longterm monitoring of bird populations. Monitoring programs often
   assume that variation in the capture rates of adults reflects variation
   in breeding densities of the sampled population. We test this assumption
   by comparing annual variation in mist-net capture rates to known
   variation in breeding densities of four species breeding in coastal
   scrub habitat st Point Reyes National Seashore, California. For the
   period 1980 to 1992, breeding densities for each species were assessed
   using spot-mapping observations of color-banded individuals. These were
   compared to capture rates calculated from constant-effort mist-netting.
   Capture rates of adults correlated significantly with breeding density
   for Spotted Towhees (Pipilo maculatus), Song Sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia), and Wrentits (Chamaea fasciata), but not for White-crowned
   Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys). Analysis of covariance confirmed that
   the relationship of mist-net capture rates to breeding density differed
   among species. Independent of the effects of breeding density on capture
   rates, adult capture rates of the four species were higher in years with
   high rainfall. Among Wrentits and Song Sparrows, approximately 50\% or
   more of adults caught were not occupying territories at the study site;
   the same bias may exist among other species as well. We conclude that
   relative changes in breeding density over time can he inferred from
   variation in mist-net capture rates for some, but not all, species.
   Additional studies are needed to validate the use of mist nets to assess
   spatial differences in abundance and to monitor temporal changes in
   abundance in habitats other than coastal scrub.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of studying the effects of stress on individual organisms
   is addressed by considering the use of individual-level information to:
   (1) elucidate the mechanistic bases of interpopulation variation; (2)
   predict population-level effects; and (3) monitor stress in natural
   communities. Examples discussed include interpopulation variation in the
   sensitivity of freshwater shrimps to zinc stress; the use of
   individual-based models to predict the effects of copper stress on
   earthworm populations; the use of single-species in situ assays to
   monitor pollution. It is contended that knowledge of organism-level
   responses is essential for understanding how stressors cause adverse
   biological effects and the strategies adopted by organisms to tolerate
   stress. It is also contended that the effects of stressors on
   populations can be predicted from a knowledge of the effects of
   stressors on individual energy budgets. Organism-level responses can be
   used to monitor stress in natural environments. In situ assays, based on
   the physiological energetics of ecologically relevant species, can
   provide sensitive and general stress indicators that are correlated with
   community-level responses.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of recruitment and post-recruitment factors in
   controlling population fluctuations and determining population sizes in
   open marine systems is still poorly understood. To address this issue, I
   conducted an experiment investigating whether very early
   post-recruitment mortality of a coral reef fish, Thalassoma bifasciatum,
   is dependent on recruitment density. To quantify the extent to which
   local populations are likely to be controlled primarily by recruitment
   or by post-settlement density-dependent mortality, I also measured
   natural mortality rates and recruitment variation at sites around the
   island of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
   I manipulated densities of 1-3-d post-settlement T. bifasciatum on large
   natural patch reefs in Tague Bay, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Manipulated recruits were followed for similar to 30 d. The loss rate
   over the initial 24-h period following placement of recruits on the reef
   was positively related to the density at the beginning of that period.
   After this period, initial recruit density had no effects on mortality.
   Natural monthly mortality rates approximating the monthly mortality
   monitored during the experiment were measured for naturally recruited
   fish at sites around the island. Mortality was positively correlated
   with recruitment density. The effect was strong enough that across sites
   the relationship between recruit density and juvenile density the
   following month was not proportional; that is, juvenile density tended
   to reach an asymptote with increasing recruitment. The relationship
   between total recruitment per season at a site and adult abundance at
   the end of the season was similarly asymptotic, indicating the
   persistence of a density-dependent effect at the scale of the island.
   Mortality rates around the island were extremely variable and density
   independent at densities below similar to 1 recruit/m(2). Above that
   level, mortality rates were higher and tended to increase with further
   increases in recruitment density. Around St. Croix, three out of eight
   sites consistently received recruitment above this ``threshold,{''}
   while five sites never experienced recruitment above that level during
   the study. Because spatial patterns of recruitment around St. Croix were
   consistent over time, some local populations may be controlled mainly by
   recruitment and density-independent mortality at all times, while others
   may be chronically affected by post-settlement density dependence. This
   study gives support to the idea that recruitment limitation and density
   dependence are not mutually exclusive. Rather, local populations must be
   characterized by the degree of recruitment, the resultant population
   density, and the subsequent degree of density-dependent regulation.}},

Abstract = {{This article is a description of the current situation in France with
   regard to occupational cancer: research, prevention, and occupation.
   Toxicologic experiments are carried out using in vitro and in vivo
   tests, particularly using transgenic mice. Several epidemiologic studies
   have been conducted over the last decades: population-based case-control
   studies; mortality studies and cancer incidence studies carried out in
   historical cohorts of workers employed in the industry; and case-control
   studies nested in occupational cohorts. French ethical aspects of
   toxicologic and epidemiologic studies are described. The results thus
   obtained are used to establish regulations for the prevention and the
   compensation of cancers attributable to occupational exposure. This
   French regulation for prevention of occupational cancer involves several
   partners. ai the states authorities, including labor inspectors,
   responsible for preparing and implementing the labor legislation and for
   supervising its application, particularly in the fields of occupational
   health and safety and working conditions; b) the Social Security
   Organisation for the analysis of present or potential occupational risks
   based on tests, visits in plants, complaints or requests from various
   sources, and statistics. These activities are performed within the
   framework of the general French policy for the prevention of
   occupational cancer. This organization includes the National Institute
   for Research and Safety, particularly involved in research in the
   various fields of occupational risks-animal toxicology, biologic
   monitoring, exposure measurements epidemiology, psychology, ergonomy,
   electronic systems and machineries, exposure to chemicals, noise, heat,
   vibration, and lighting; and c) companies where the regulation defines
   the role of the plant manager, the occupational physician, and the
   Health, Safely and Working Conditions Committee (comprising the manager,
   employees' representatives, the occupational physician, and the safety
   department) in dealing with any problem regarding safety, occupational
   hygiene, and working conditions. These organizations along with medical
   practitioners are involved with the compensation of occupational
   cancers. The regulation for compensation includes the tables of
   occupational cancer, the possibility of recognition of a cancer case
   when the requirements of the tables are not met, and the
   postprofessional follow-up of workers exposed to a carcinogenic agent.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect exposure approaches offer a feasible and accurate method for
   estimating population exposures to indoor pollutants, including
   environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). In an effort to make the indirect
   exposure assessment approach more accessible to people in the health and
   risk assessment fields, this paper provides examples using real data
   from a) a week-long personal carbon monoxide monitoring survey conducted
   by the author; and b) the 1992 to 1994 National Human Activity Pattern
   Survey (NHAPS) for the United States. The indirect approach uses
   measurements of exposures in specific microenvironments (e.g., homes,
   bars, offices), validated microenvironmental models (based on the mass
   balance equation), and human activity pattern data obtained from
   questionnaires to predict frequency distributions of exposure for entire
   populations. This approach requires fewer resources than the direct
   approach to exposure assessment, for which the distribution of monitors
   to a representative sample of a given population is necessary. In the
   indirect exposure assessment approach, average microenvironmental
   concentrations are multiplied by the total time spent in each
   microenvironment to give total integrated exposure. By assuming that the
   concentrations encountered in each of 10 location categories are the
   same for different members of the U.S. population (i.e., the NHAPS
   respondents), the hypothetical contribution that ETS makes to the
   average 24-hr respirable suspended particle exposure for Americans
   working their main job is calculated in this paper to be 18 mu g/m(3).
   This article is an illustrative review and does not contain an actual
   exposure assessment or model validation.}},

Abstract = {{It is more and more recognised that an estimation of the exposure of the
   population to air pollutants is more relevant than the ambient air
   quality, since it gives a better indication of health risk. Outdoor
   workers in an urban region are generally of low income status and are
   exposed to higher levels of both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Hence
   respondents from this population subgroup have been selected for this
   study. Outdoor workers are divided into two categories, viz. traffic
   constables and casual outdoor workers like watchmen, roadside
   shopkeepers etc. Most of the respondents are from the lower income
   group. Each respondent is monitored for a continuous 48-hour period. The
   sampling frequency is once a week.
   The study region is situated in the north-west part of the Greater
   Mumbai Municipal Corporation. It can be classified as industrial cum
   residential area. The daily integrated exposure of the outdoor workers
   consists of two major micro-environments, viz. occupational and indoor
   residential.
   A personal air sampler was used along with a cyclone to measure levels
   of Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM). The cyclone has a 50\% removal
   efficiency for particle diameter of 5 mu m. Paired samples of PM10
   (ambient) and RPM (personal) were collected to establish the correlation
   between them. The average 24-hour integrated exposure to RPM was 322 mu
   g/m(3) and exceeded the corresponding PM10 level observed at the nearest
   Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station by a factor of 2.25. The 90\%
   confidence interval for this exposure is 283-368 mu g/m(3). This study
   clearly demonstrates that the daily integrated exposure and therefore
   the health risk of outdoor workers in an urban area is significantly
   more serious than that indicated by ambient air quality data.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal variation of salinity, specific conductivity,
   temprature, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, soluble
   reactive phosphate (SRP), ammonium, nitrate, phytoplankton and
   mesozooplankton within Baffin Bay, Texas were monitored monthly from
   April 1995-July 1996 to understand better the seasonal variability of
   the Texas `brown tide', Aureoumbra lagunensis.
   High A. lagunensis densities (0.05-5.97 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) were
   observed in the summer months, whereas low densities (<0.01-3.6 x 10(6)
   cells ml(-1)) occurred during the winter. Statistical analysis of
   results gave no significant relationship between A. lagunensis densities
   and any physical parameters during most sampling events. Most sampling
   events exhibited high salinities (S>40) and A. lagunensis densities were
   greatest between 25 and 30 degrees C. This suggests that A. lagunensis
   is well adapted to the warm hypersaline environment. Surface water SRP
   and ammonium concentrations were inversely related to A. lagunensis
   densities at: all sample stations (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively).
   Aureoumbra lagunensis densities showed no relation with other chemical
   parameters. Acartia tonsa, Oithona brevicornis and Oithona sp. were the
   predominant mesozooplankton during the study. Although A. tonsa occurred
   in higher concentrations than other mesozooplankton, A. lagunensis and
   A, tonsa densities showed no significant relationship. Densities of
   Oithona sp, were inversely related to A. lagunensis cell densities
   (P<0.05) signifying possible grazing pressures. These results suggest
   that additional parameters other than those investigated are
   contributing to the seasonal variability and the persistence of Texas
   `brown tide.' (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{1. Long-term studies allow the outcomes of repeated selection events to
   be monitored. Here, we investigate phenotypic selection in successive
   winter mortality events in the Soay sheep of St Kilda, Scotland, between
   1985 and 1996. Selection of three quantitative morphometric traits, body
   weight, hindleg length and incisor arcade breadth, was investigated in
   different sectors of the population.
   2, Evidence from fitness differentials of positive directional selection
   for large size was repeatedly found in lambs and adult females.
   Selection in the opposing direction was only found in one year in lambs.
   3. Selection gradients showed that in most years when significant
   selection occurred, body weight was the focus of direct selection,
   whereas selection of hindleg length and incisor breadth was indirect,
   arising from their correlation with body weight.
   4, Selection was strongest in years of low over-winter survival and
   almost absent in years when survival was high. Intensity of selection
   was greatest in lambs, emphasizing the differences in selection pressure
   experienced by different sectors of the population, in addition to the
   temporal variation in selection pressure due to population density and
   environmental conditions.
   5. Despite repeated positive selection of body weight, no evidence of a
   change in the population mean was found over the course of the study.}},

Abstract = {{In 1996, the exotic white-spotted tussock moth (WSTM), Orgyia thyellina
   (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), was discovered in Auckland, New Zealand.
   Because establishment of WSTM would threaten New Zealand's orchard
   industry and international trade, eradication of WSTM with microbial
   insecticide was initiated To monitor and complement eradication of WSTM
   by capture of male moths in pheromone-baited traps, pheromone components
   of female WSTM needed to be identified. Coupled gas
   chromatographic-electroantennographic detection analysis of pheromone
   gland extract revealed several compounds that elicited responses from
   male moth antennae. Mass spectra of the two most EAD-active compounds
   suggested, and comparative GC-MS of authentic standards confirmed, that
   they were (Z)-6-heneicosen-11-one (Z6-11-one) and
   (Z)-6-heneicosen-9-one, the latter termed here ``thyellinone.{''} In
   field experiments in Japan, Z6-11-one plus thyellinone at a 100:5 ratio
   attracted WSTM males, whereas either ketone alone failed to attract a
   single male moth. Addition of further candidate pheromone components did
   not enhance attractiveness of the binary blend. Through the 1997-1998
   summer, 45,000 commercial trap lures baited with 2000 mu g of Z6-11-one
   and 100 mu g of thyellinone were deployed in Auckland towards
   eradication of the residual WSTM population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach-grey compromise programing-for siting
   new air quality monitoring stations in a metropolitan region. In
   particular; cost, effectiveness and efficiency characteristics for
   expanding the existing air quality monitoring network are postulated in
   the multi-criteria decision-making process. In order to test the impacts
   of the growth of population and emission sources, a series of technical
   settings in the grey compromise programing model were examined and the
   uncertainties possibly embedded in the planning procedure were
   recognized for assessing the optimal expansion alternatives in the air
   quality monitoring network. The practical implementation was established
   by a case study for the city of Kaohsiung in Taiwan. It appears that
   such an approach is useful for screening the expansion alternatives in
   the air quality monitoring network under uncertain environments, that
   may further help planners and decision makers find more flexible
   solutions based on those multiobjective design principles. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{We monitored a natural population of arctic ground squirrels
   (Spermophilus parryii kennicottii) on the North Slope of Alaska for
   seasonal changes in body mass and composition and dates of immergence
   into and emergence from hibernation. Yearlings and adult females were at
   the lowest body mass of their active season at emergence in spring.
   Their mean body mass did not increase for 1 month after emergence and
   peaked in July (adult females) and August (yearlings). Body mass of
   adult males was near the highest of the active season when they emerged
   from hibernation and decreased by 21\% over the subsequent 10-day mating
   season. Juveniles gained body mass during their active season, except
   for significant losses associated with dispersal. During hibernation,
   females lost >30\% of their body mass, but adult males emerged in spring
   without significant decreases in body mass, fat, or lean. Yearling and
   nonreproductive males were significantly lower in fat but not lean mass
   at emergence than immergence, and females were significantly lower in
   fat and lean mass. Arctic ground squirrels entered hibernation over a
   >1-month interval beginning in early August; females entered before
   males, and adults of each sex immerged before juveniles. Reproductive
   males emerged before females, and fatter females emerged significantly
   earlier than leaner females. Vaginal estrus was maximal at 3 days
   post-emergence. Nonreproductive males emerged last from hibernation.
   Mean +/- SE days in hibernation was 240.1 +/- 12.1 for adult females
   (69\% of the year), 235.8 +/- 10.3 for juvenile females, 230.3 +/- 4.2
   for nonreproductive males, 220.3 +/- 12.5 for adult males, and 214.7 +/-
   6.5 for juvenile males. Timing of immergence into and emergence from
   hibernation for arctic ground squirrels did not differ significantly
   from sciurid populations in temperate latitudes.}},

   found shelter in dense grass. Two large caves were used as shelters and
   also to raise young. The degree of conservation of the forest and human
   disturbance around the shelters did not influence use by otters.
   However, otters used shelters located higher on the river banks more
   frequently, probably because they were less vulnerable to flooding.
   Considering all shelters found during 1 year, shelters of L, longicaudis
   were distributed at random along the stream, and scent marks were not
   concentrated around them. Number of shelters in use per month was
   constant throughout the year, indicating that this can be used to
   monitor populations of river otters.}},

Abstract = {{Subdivision of a population into reproductive units and rates of
   exchanges among them may influence population dynamics. Unfortunately,
   subpopulation units and flows of immigration and emigration are
   difficult to estimate because of the lack of data on spatial behavior of
   individuals. By studying two populations of chamois (Rupicapra), 244
   marked animals, and a 10-year monitoring program, we determined that
   subpopulation units were related closely to topographic limits in which
   >90\% of the females were philopatric. Males had a greater tendency to
   disperse than females, especially before reproduction, but females did
   more exploratory movements. We found no difference in sex-specific
   dispersal rates between sites, despite differences in densities and
   sex-ratio. The relatively high dispersal rate of males and the lack of
   effects of sex-ratio and density on dispersal rates support the
   inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis as a main cause of dispersal. High rates
   of exploratory movements, especially among females, indicates that local
   resource competition within female groups also may play a role.
   Dispersal patterns have to be explained in the context of possible
   different motivations between sexes, related to social and spatial
   segregation. Moreover, we argue for an effect of topography, which
   determines where dispersal is possible. Accordingly, dispersal occurred
   at a site with continuous connections with favorable habitat.
   Colonization of new areas from protected reserves is limited by low
   dispersal rates of females and increasing isolation between favorable
   areas in mountains. Management and conservation policies have to take
   these aspects into account to predict distribution of chamois on a large
   scale and cope with high local densities resulting from female
   philopatry.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies were conducted in 2 types of grasslands in the Pryer
   Mountain Wild Horse Range of northern Wyoming and southern Montana to
   examine plant biomass production and nitrogen responses to the separate
   and combined effects of graminoid defoliation and increased
   environmental resource (water or nutrients) supply. Short-term plant
   responses were monitored over 2 years which differed substantially in
   growing season precipitation. In the arid, low elevation grassland,
   total grass biomass was significantly lower in the dry year than the wet
   year in all treatments. Defoliation of the grasses did not reduce their
   aboveground biomass production in the wet year, but severely reduced it
   in the dry year, primarily because of a decrease in tiller density. Mass
   of remaining individual tillers increased with clipping in the dry year,
   and nitrogen concentrations of the grasses increased with clipping in
   both years. Irrigation alone increased total belowground biomass
   compared to the other treatments, but did not increase the aboveground
   biomass production of any plant functional group. Clipping plus
   irrigation resulted in greater total aboveground biomass production and
   higher nitrogen concentrations of the grasses than control or irrigated
   treatments. Clipping graminoids in the more mesic montane grassland did
   not decrease their biomass production in either year, but did increase
   their nitrogen concentrations and increase the collective aboveground
   biomass production of the other plant functional groups. Fertilization
   and fertilization plus clipping significantly increased total
   aboveground biomass production in both years, and total belowground
   biomass was greatest in fertilized plots.}},

Abstract = {{Harbour seals in the Wadden Sea (The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark)
   have been monitored by aerial surveys since the 1980s. Annual maximum
   figures reported in the various regions (38 separate tidal basins) and
   the number of pups counted were used to estimate vital population
   parameters and to quantify the net migration of harbour seals within the
   Wadden Sea before (1980-1987) and after an epizootic (1990-1994). The
   total pre-whelping population increased at a mean annual rate of 9 and
   14\%, respectively, and varied considerably among the various regions of
   the Wadden Sea. The overall mean annual survival was found to increase
   from 0.88 during the pre-epizootic period to 0.93 during the
   post-epizootic period. The distribution of pups and of older seals over
   the 38 separate sub-areas was highly uneven. Based on between-year
   population changes and the number of pups reported, net dispersal fluxes
   among the four regions of the Wadden Sea were estimated for the two time
   intervals. During the pre-epizootic period: only Schleswig-Holstein,
   Germany, produced a surplus of animals which counter-balanced the low
   recruitment of the other regions. During the post-epizootic period, the
   net dispersal fluxes were at a much lower level. Nevertheless, in The
   Netherlands, a continuous influx of seals was required because the
   recruitment was insufficient to explain the observed numerical increase.
   At the level of the 38 separate tidal basins, the actual pattern of
   dispersal showed that the majority of sub-areas were not self-supporting
   with respect to the local pup production and thus dependent on the
   influx of animals. More than 65\% of all immigrants originated from only
   7 sub-areas, which are considered `key areas' of vital importance for
   the Wadden Sea harbour seal population. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet-B (UVB, 280-320 nm) radiation is a natural component of
   sunlight that harms organisms and disturbs natural communities in
   surface waters. A natural planktonic assemblage of organisms (<240 mu m)
   was studied in a mesocosm experiment for 7 d under varying conditions of
   UVB radiation: UVB excluded, natural radiation, and UVB enhanced at two
   different levels. The dynamics of several populations at different
   trophic levels comprising heterotrophic bacteria (<1 mu m),
   heterotrophic flagellates (2-10 mu m), small phytoplankton (<5 mu m),
   large phyto plankton (5-20 mu m), and ciliates (15-35 mu m) were
   monitored during the experiment. Enhanced UVB provoked a significant
   decrease in the number of ciliates (66\%) and large phytoplankton (63\%)
   relative to natural WE conditions. The severe effects of UVB radiation
   on ciliates and large phytoplankton communities shown here would
   strongly limit upward transfer of mass and energy. The decline of
   predator abundance (ciliates) under UVB stress relative to natural
   conditions resulted in a positive feedback between enhanced UVB
   radiation and prey abundances, shown by increased abundances of bacteria
   (49\%), heterotrophic flagellates (up to 300\%), and small phytoplankton
   (41\%). Similarly, with respect to carbon partitioning, the decrease in
   ciliate and diatom carbon biomass (64 and 56\%, respectively) under
   enhanced WE exposure was balanced by an increase in the carbon biomass
   of heterotrophic bacteria (48\%), heterotrophic flagellates (126\%), and
   autotrophic flagellates (162\%). As a manifestation of enhanced UVB at
   the community level, the ecosystem develops toward a microbial food web
   in preference to an herbivorous food web. Thus, enhanced UVB radiation
   can change the structure and dynamics of the pelagic food web.}},

Abstract = {{A large-scale field experiment was used to test whether exposure to a
   suite of potential environmental factors (flow speed, temperature,
   salinity, and low dissolved oxygen) influences the level of parasitic
   infection of the oyster Crassostrea virginica. The parasite was the
   protozoan Perkinsus marinus, which has decimated populations of oysters
   in estuaries of North America. The environmental factors were considered
   stressors because they influence the physiological condition of either
   the host or parasite. Between December 1994 and July 1995, flow speed,
   temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), Perkinsus
   infection, and mortality of oysters were monitored across 24
   experimental oyster reefs in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina.
   Eight reef treatments were created consisting of an orthogonal
   combination of three factors: water depth (3 m vs. 6 m deep), reef
   height (2 m vs. 1 m tall), and position on reef (base vs, crest).
   Principal component analysis revealed that there was clear separation of
   environmental factors among reefs and that a majority of the variation
   (96.2\%) among treatments could be explained by two principal component
   axes (PCs): one (24.3\% of variation explained) was formed by flow and
   the other (71.9\% of variation explained) by temperature, salinity, and
   DO. Oysters with the highest proportion of individuals infected
   (prevalence), highest intensity of infection, and highest mortality were
   located at the base of reefs, where flow speeds and food quality were
   lowest and sedimentation rates highest. However, there was no
   significant effect of hydrographic conditions on Perkinsus infection or
   mortality of oysters, despite large differences in mean salinity, DO,
   and exposure to hypoxia-anoxia. Temperature did not vary among
   treatments. Correlation of disease responses (infection prevalence and
   intensity, and mortality) with the first two PCs showed that these
   response variables were significantly (and negatively) correlated with
   flow only. Oysters in low flow were hypothesized to have:the greatest
   susceptibility to Perkinsus infection because of their poor
   physiological condition. The restoration of oyster reefs increases reef
   height and thus flow speeds (by elevating oysters higher above the
   boundary and by actively influencing flow), thereby reducing the
   negative effects of disease by restoring reef morphology to its natural
   size.}},

Title = {{Predation on lizard eggs by ante: species interactions in a variable

Abstract = {{One explanation for long-term fluctuations in population density is that
   the intensity of interactions between species is variable. A population
   can experience variation in the intensity of a species interaction if
   (1) the density of species with which it directly interacts changes
   and/or (2) the strength of the interaction (i.e., per capita effects)
   changes. At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, the tropical lizard Anolis
   limifrons exhibits wide annual fluctuations in density. Previous studies
   have indicated that (1) the density of A. limifrons is negatively
   correlated with the amount of wet-season rainfall, (2) fluctuations in
   density are related more to variation in egg mortality than to variation
   in lizard mortality or to fecundity, and (3) most egg mortality is the
   result of predation by Solenopsis ants. We hypothesized that the amount
   of wet-season rainfall indirectly alters the density of A. limifrons by
   producing variation in the intensity of egg predation by Solenopsis.
   Additionally, we also wanted to determine if variation in the amount of
   egg mortality was influenced more by variation in the density of
   Solenopsis, or by variation in the rate of predation. We tested this
   hypothesis by manipulating litter moisture on experimental plots to
   simulate the wettest (HW) and driest (LW) wet seasons in the last 20
   years, and then monitoring the density of Solenopsis, amount of egg
   mortality, and rate of predation. The amount of egg mortality was
   greater on the HW than on the LW treatment and all egg mortality
   resulted from predation by Solenopsis. ANCOVA indicated that the amount
   of egg mortality was significantly higher on plots with a greater
   density of Solenopsis. Treatment effects, however, explained more of the
   variation in the amount of egg mortality than did Solenopsis density.
   Our water manipulations did not change the density of Solenopsis, but
   Solenopsis found and attacked eggs faster on the HW than on the LW
   treatment. This suggests that moisture during the wet season modified
   the strength of the interaction between Solenopsis and A. limifrons,
   supporting the hypothesis that annual variation in the amount of
   wet-season rainfall indirectly produces parallel variation in annual
   density of lizard populations by modifying the rate of ant predation on
   eggs.}},

Abstract = {{We studied three types of movements: (1) movements leading to permanent
   transfer of individuals between habitat patches, (2) movements
   (excursions) into habitat corridors and (3) into a barren matrix area,
   and the demographic consequences in 12 enclosed populations of the root
   vole, Micrototus oeconomus. Each population was subdivided into two
   demes inhabiting one habitat patch each. The two patches were
   approximately two male home range diameters apart in a vole-hostile,
   devegetated matrix. While the patches were connected by a narrow (0.5 m)
   habitat corridor for six of the populations, the other six populations
   inhabited isolated patches. The experiment was initiated by introducing
   laboratory raised founder demes onto each patch in the beginning of
   July. The populations were thereafter monitored by live trapping for the
   next 4-5 months during the snow-free season. After the snow melted the
   following spring the experiment was terminated by removal trapping. The
   experiment was run over two years (1994 and 1995) with six population
   replicates each year. Movements into the corridors and permanent
   transfers of animals between patches were registered during ordinary
   live trapping at 15-d intervals. Movements into the barren matrix
   habitat were registered continuously during the snow-free season by
   activating edge traps along the fences of the enclosures every night.
   Except for males early in the summer, movements leading to transfer of
   individuals between dames were rare relative to mortality and
   recruitment, and transfer did not act to synchronize the dynamics
   between demes. Moreover, transferred animals possessed the same survival
   probability as those staying in their natal deme. Corridors slightly
   enhanced the rate of transfer in females, but not in males. Excursions
   into corridors and the matrix area took place much more frequently than
   transfer and most frequently in the first cohorts early in the season
   and more in males than in females. Movements in the hostile matrix had a
   considerable negative effect on survival and, thus on the demography of
   the populations. Predation by birds is the most likely cause of this
   movement related mortality which may play an important role in the
   dynamics of patchy vole populations during the snow-free season.
   Movements into the corridors did not have any independent effect on
   survival probability, and habitat corridors may thus act to transfer
   animals more safely from one patch to another.}},

Abstract = {{Since early 1989, we have conducted a large-scale ecological
   manipulation in a semiarid thorn scrub community in north-central Chile.
   We have excluded vertebrate predators (raptors and mammalian
   carnivores), and larger small mammal herbivore/competitors (i.e., degus,
   Octodon degus) from replicated 0.56-ha plots, and monitored small mammal
   population and plant responses over more than ten years. Repeated
   measures ANOVAs on minimum number known alive (MNKA) estimates of small
   mammals for a six-year period (1990-1996) spanning an El Nino event in
   1991-1992 showed strong responses of some species to predator exclusions
   (e.g., O. degus; Darwin's leaf-eared mouse, Phyllotis darwini; the
   chinchilla-rat, Abrocoma bennetti). However, responses varied in time
   with significant effects during pre-El Nino (1990-1992) and El Nino
   (1992-1994) periods (i.e., 0. degus), or pre-El Nino and post-El Nino
   (1994-1996) periods (P. darwini. A. bennetti). Other species showed no
   responses to predator exclusions (e.g., olivaceous field mouse, Akodon
   olivaceus; long-haired field mouse, Abrothrix longipilis; long-tailed
   rice rat, Oligoryzomys longi caudatus). Some effects of competitor
   (degu) exclusions were detected (e.g., A. bennetti during the El Nino
   and post-El Nino periods; O. longicatrrlntus during the El Nino).
   ``Top-down,{''} factors (i.e., biotic interactions) appear to have
   greater effects on ``core species{''} (i.e., P. darwini, O. degus) which
   persist in the thorn scrub. Other species (e.g., A. longipilis, O.
   longicaudatus) are transitory residents or ``opportunistic{''} with
   lesser effects of biotic interactions, and their populations may be
   controlled by source-sink dynamics. All species had strong, responses to
   the 1991-1992 El Nino indicating primary control by ``bottom-up{''}
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Soil suppressiveness to Heterodera schachtii was demonstrated in a field
   at the research station of the University of California, Riverside. In
   two field trials planted to Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris), introduced H.
   schachtii multiplied 2.7 and 1.7 times more in preplant metam
   sodium-fumigated plots than in nontreated plots in 1994 and 1995,
   respectively. In greenhouse experiments, preplant treatments with metam
   sodium, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, formaldehyde, and aerated steam
   reduced suppressiveness of soil against H, schachtii to undetectable
   levels. H. schachtii multiplied significantly less in nontreated soil
   than in treated soil on Swiss chard. At harvest, the number of infective
   second-stage juveniles in suppressive soil was close to the lowest
   detection level, whereas high numbers were encountered in soils
   initially treated. In a crop rotation trial with host crops of H.
   schachtii, introduced H. schachtii populations were monitored for five
   cropping periods over 30 months in initially fumigated versus nontreated
   suppressive field plots. In fumigated plots, H, schachtii population
   levels increased in the first and second cropping periods and then
   declined in the third cropping period. In the fourth and fifth cropping
   periods, the nematode reproduction factor in the initially fumigated
   plots was not significantly different from that in suppressive plots.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of fungicides in controlling cottonball disease of
   cranberry was tested during 1996 to 1998 at three locations in
   Wisconsin. For some fungicides, the efficacy of four applications, two
   each during shoot elongation and bloom, was compared with two
   applications during bloom only. Spraying twice during bloom was as
   effective in controlling secondary infection as spraying twice during
   shoot elongation plus twice during bloom. Azoxystrobin, cyprodinil, and
   propiconazole were equally effective. None of the treatments affected
   yield, fruit retention, or berry weight compared with the controls.
   Sensitivity of M. oxycocci, the cottonball pathogen, to fenbuconazole
   and propiconazole was tested in vitro by comparing the distributions of
   ED,, values of populations collected from three sites that differed in
   previous exposure to fungicides. Median ED,, values for fenbuconazole
   were significantly greater at sites where sterol demethylation inhibitor
   fungicides had been used compared with a site where fungicides had never
   been used, but median ED,, values for propiconazole did not differ among
   sites. There was no correlation between the sensitivities to
   fenbuconazole and propiconazole. The data will form the basis of
   recommendations aimed at delaying the onset of fungicide resistance and
   will provide a baseline for monitoring resistance to fenbuconazole and
   propiconazole in populations of M. oxycocci in the future.}},

Abstract = {{On the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia two species of predatory
   beetle, Trechisibus antarcticus and Oopterus soledadinus (Coleoptera,
   Carabidae), were accidentally introduced. The colonisation process
   offers unique opportunities for testing ecological hypotheses in the
   field. As a basis for such studies, the spatial dynamics of the two
   species in the coastal lowland around Stromness Bay and Cumberland Bay
   were monitored during the period 1988-1996. Data are presented on the
   expansion of the two species and on the thermal characteristics of the
   tussock-forming grass Parodiochloa flabellata, which dominates the
   coastal lowlands. The largest expansion was shown by T. antarcticus,
   occurring as two populations in the Stromness Bay area. The origin of
   one of the populations, discovered in 1982, is Husvik Harbour, from
   where the species has colonised the central part of Stromness Bay. The
   second population. discovered in 1988 at Harbour Point, is invading the
   northern part of the area around Stromness Bay. Up to the present, three
   populations of O. soledadinus have been discovered. One population was
   found in 1988 at Husvik Harbour, co-existing with T. antarcticus, from
   where it is slowly expanding its distribution into the coastal zone. A
   second, very small, population of O. soledadinus was found in 1996 at
   Jason Harbour (Cumberland West Bay). The largest population of O.
   soledadinus, first reported in 1963, inhabits the area around Grytviken
   and King Edward Point (Cumberland East Bay), where it is the sole
   carabid species. The tussock grass vegetation offers a highly stable
   thermal environment compared with the more variable surroundings.
   Together with an ample food supply in the form of small arthropods and
   beetle larvae, and a vacant niche for arthropod predators, the benign
   microclimate of the tussock vegetation may explain the success of these
   predator introductions. Results of field observations on population
   parameters of the carabids, and laboratory measurement of egg production
   indicate the potential for large-scale co-existence.}},

Abstract = {{Hair samples of 15 adult male Atlantic walruses (Odobenus rosmarus
   rosmarus) collected from anaesthetized individuals at Svalbard, Norway,
   were analysed for cadmium and total mercury. The mean level of cadmium
   was 0.860 +/- 0.321 mu g/g dry weight (median = 0.811, range =
   0.349-1.51 mu g/g dry weight) and the mean level of mercury was 0.235
   +/- 0.100 mu g/g dry weight (median = 0.251, range = 0.121-0.424 mu g/g
   dry weight). Levels of cadmium and mercury in hair of walruses from
   other areas are not known. Both cadmium and mercury levels in hair of
   walruses from Svalbard are relatively low compared to the levels found
   in the hair of other marine mammal species. It has been documented from
   a number of marine species, including marine mammals such as ringed
   seals and polar bears, that both cadmium and mercury levels at Svalbard
   are lower than in other areas. It is uncertain as to what degree levels
   in hair reflect levels in internal organs in walruses. In rare and
   highly endangered species or populations tissue samples can be difficult
   to collect. In walruses, it is possible to collect hair from
   anaesthetized individuals or at the haul-out sites during moult, to
   monitor heavy metal levels of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment toxicity test and bioassay protocols are currently being
   standardised in order to meet European legislative requirements for
   product assessments and environmental monitoring. Most existing test
   methods require that sediment-dwelling organisms are exposed to test
   substances bound to sediment in test systems with uncontaminated
   overlying water. These test systems have not been widely compared with
   responses of field populations under realistic exposure conditions. In
   this study, sediment toxicity data generated in the laboratory were
   compared with the response of a field population of the midge Chironomus
   riparius exposed to the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin. In the field
   this insecticide was applied to the overlying water column of artificial
   pond systems to give nominal concentrations of 1, 10, 50 and 100 mu g/L.
   The field response, as measured by larval density and adult emergence,
   was not predicted by bulk sediment chemical concentration, sediment
   toxicity test or laboratory bioassay results. All three measurements
   underestimated acute toxic effect. Rather, toxicity to C. riparius in
   the field was predicted more accurately using a short-term water-only
   toxicity test. No chronic or sublethal effects due-to sediment-bound
   permethrin were observed. This indicates that the primary route of
   exposure in the field was probably via the water column. Primary routes
   of exposure are difficult to predict a priori for different chemical
   types until the factors affecting bioavailability have been fully
   elucidated. Until this time, there isa need for the validation of
   predictive sediment toxicity tests and for the measurement of in situ
   biological response in conjunction with sediment chemistry and toxicity
   for environmental monitoring purposes, particularly when ongoing
   exposure via the water column is likely. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A diagnostic procedure based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
   developed for the myxosporean parasite Ceratomyxa shasta. Three sets of
   oligonucleotide primers were designed to specifically amplify C, shasta
   ribosomal RNA genes and several parameters of the assay were tested and
   optimised. A simple protocol for the processing of fish tissue samples
   was also developed. In a single round, 20 mu l volume reaction the
   optimised procedure allows the detection of 50 fg of purified C. shasta
   genomic DNA, or 0.01 spore from a seeded fish intestine sample. This
   protocol is considerably faster, cheaper and more reliable than any
   previous diagnostic procedure for a myxosporean parasite, and can be an
   invaluable tool for the monitoring of early and/or subclinical C, shasta
   infections in wild and cultured salmon populations.}},

Abstract = {{Acorn production is characterized by extreme variation among years and
   among individual trees. The size of acorn crops affects many components
   of the ecosystem, and both annual and individual variation in acorn
   production influence the regeneration and management of oak forests. In
   order to assess the variation within a stand, we sampled the acorn
   production of 120 red oaks (Subgenus Erythrobalanus) for 11 years. Half
   of the trees were treated by thinning 2 years before the study began,
   and half were unthinned controls. Trees in the thinned part of the stand
   produced more acorns per tree than those in the unthinned area, but the
   treatment effect was small in comparison with individual and annual
   variation. Differences in acorn production between the most productive
   and least productive individual trees were about 11-fold for thinned and
   28-fold for unthinned trees. The largest yearly acorn collection
   exceeded the smallest by 135 times for the thinned treatment and by 109
   times for the unthinned treatment. The two best years (1991, 1993)
   accounted for 55\% of the total 11-year acorn collection, while the five
   poorest years provided only 10\% of the total collection, suggesting
   that efforts to enhance regeneration should coincide with mast years.
   Thinned and unthinned sample populations exhibited synchronous masting
   patterns, and good and poor producers within each population also
   exhibited year-to-year synchrony in acorn production. There was no
   evidence of cyclic acorn production by this population. Half of the
   total acorn collection was produced by about one-third of the trees. On
   average, we were able to identify 87\% of the better-than-average acorn
   producers by monitoring individual tree production for any three
   consecutive years. This method of identifying superior acorn producers
   is effective and conceptually simple but it requires at least 3 years to
   implement. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal reproductive success was examined in Styrax obassia
   (Styracaceae), a bumble-bee pollinated mass-flowering tree in a
   cool-temperate deciduous forest in northern Japan. The effects of flower
   number on the success of individual flowers at three levels
   (inflorescence, individual, and population) were considered. During 1995
   and 1996, variations in size, light availability to branches, floral
   display size, and fruit set were monitored in 37 out of 211 individual
   S. obassia trees in a 4-ha forest plot. In addition, the locations of
   the 211 trees in this plot were mapped and the number of inflorescences
   in each tree was counted. A multiple regression analysis showed that
   flower number per inflorescence and inflorescence number per individual
   had negative effects on fruit set, and inflorescence number of
   aggregated clumps of flowering trees, tree size, and light resource had
   positive effects on fruit set although significant level were marginal.
   It is concluded that pollinator attraction may occur not at the
   individual tree level, but at the level of a clump of flowering trees.
   It is also suggested that geitonogamy increased with inflorescence
   number of tree and inflorescence size and that resource limitation was
   related to the light condition and variation of tree size.}},

Abstract = {{Horsenettle (Solanum carolinense: Solanaceae) plants possess the ability
   to bear both hermaphroditic and male flowers on the same plant, a
   breeding system referred to as andromonoecy. As part of an ongoing
   investigation into the evolution and maintenance of andromonoecy in
   horsenettle we conducted a field investigation that addressed the
   following questions:
   1. Are fruit and seed production in horsenettle populations pollen
   limited?
   2. Do pollen additions affect sex expression?
   3. Is the size of the floral display or the percentage of flowers that
   are male associated with percentage fruit set, and therefore possibly
   related to the attraction of pollinators?
   We conducted pollen additions on 25 plants in each of two populations,
   and monitored 25 open pollinated control plants at each site. Mean
   percentage fruit set and seed set per fruit was significantly greater in
   the pollen addition treatment than in the control, which indicates that
   both populations were pollen limited. The percentage of flowers on a
   plant that were male was significantly greater in the pollen addition
   treatment than in the control, which suggests that pollen addition
   affects sex expression in horsenettle. Percentage fruit set did not
   correlate with total flower number or percentage of male flowers, which
   indicates that a larger floral display does not affect pollinator
   behavior in ways that influence female reproductive success. The results
   document the existence of pollen limitation in the two horsenettle
   populations studied and suggest that future studies should determine if
   male flower production influences male fitness or vegetative
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-four plant species native or naturalized in Britain were grown in
   the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, UK and evaluated as potential
   resources for nectar-foraging bees, butterflies and hoverflies. In ten
   plant species a series of measurements were made, at regular intervals
   from dawn to dusk, of nectar secretion rate and standing crop, and in
   all species insect visits were monitored throughout daylight hours. The
   study revealed differences between plant species in the composition of
   the assemblage of insect visitors, and in the magnitude and temporal
   distribution of the nectar reward. In some cases we found interesting
   correlations between temperature and secretion rates or patterns of
   insect visits. Species that received numerous insect visits in our study
   are potentially valuable forage plants that might be planted by
   gardeners to support local :pollinator populations. Deep flowers whose
   nectar is accessible to long-tongued bumblebees (Bombus hortorum, B.
   pascuorum) but not to honeybees may provide long-tongued pollinators
   with a resource refuge relatively free from honeybee competition.
   Features that make some of those plant species particularly interesting
   to observe in the garden include robbing by short-tongued bumblebees in
   Saponaria, baseworking by honeybees on closed flowers in Malva
   sylvestris, and apparent displacement of bumblebees by territorial
   behaviour of the solitary bee Anthidium manicatum on species of Stachys.

Abstract = {{Snail Kites (Rostrhamus sociabilis) in Florida were monitored between
   1969 and 1994 using a quasi-systematic annual survey. We analyzed data
   from the annual Snail Kite survey using a generalized linear model where
   counts were regarded as overdispersed Poisson random variables. This
   approach allowed us to investigate covariates that might have obscured
   temporal patterns of population change or induced spurious patterns in
   count data by influencing detection rates. We selected a model that
   distinguished effects related to these covariates from other temporal
   effects, allowing us to identify patterns of population change in count
   data. Snail Kite counts were influenced by observed differences, site
   effects, effort, and water levels. Because there was no temporal overlap
   of the primary observers who collected count data, patterns of change
   could be estimated within time intervals covered by an observed, but not
   for the intervals among observers. Modeled population change was quite
   different from the change in counts, suggesting that analyses based on
   unadjusted counts do not accurately model Snail Kite population change.
   Results from this analysis were consistent with previous reports of an
   association between water levels and counts, although further work is
   needed to determine whether water levels affect actual population size
   as well as detection rates of Snail Kites. Although the effects of
   variation in detection rates can sometimes be mitigated by including
   controls for factors related to detection rates, it is often difficult
   to distinguish factors wholly related to detection rates from factors
   related to population size. For factors related to both, count survey
   data cannot be adequately analyzed without explicit estimation of
   detection rates, using procedures such as capture-recapture.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the occurrence of introduced raccoons was collected for
   62 islands of the Queen Charlotte archipelago, to determine their
   current and potential distribution relative to colonies of native,
   burrow-nesting seabirds. Raccoons or their sign were found on 32 of 37
   islands (86\%) requiring crossings of up to 400 m, six of 21 islands
   (29\%) requiring crossings of 400-800 m, and one of four islands
   surveyed beyond this distance, located 950 m offshore. An estimated 83\%
   of burrow-nesting seabird colonies, and 80\% of burrow-nesting seabirds
   are potentially accessible with over-water crossings of 950 m or less.
   Evidence of raccoons has been found on three islands that historically
   contained seabird colonies, and on 11 active colony islands, on which
   14\% of the region's seabird population breeds. A logistic regression
   model using island isolation and size as predictors indicated that 55\%
   of burrow-nesting seabirds occur on islands with a probability of
   raccoon occurrence greater than or equal to 0.5. A second model
   incorporating oceanic exposure as well. provided a better fit to the
   raccoon occurrence data and reduced the above value to 22\%. However,
   the data set used contained relatively few exposed (west coast) sites,
   thus the true influence of exposure warrants further investigation.
   Future management efforts should include continued, standardized
   monitoring, quantitative evaluation of monitoring techniques, and
   research into effective control methods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Bat diversity and activity patterns were monitored using mist-nets and
   bat detectors, and roosting habitat was investigated using
   radio-telemetry in western Newfoundland during June-Angust 1995. Of the
   three species of bat known to occur in Newfoundland (Lasiurus cinereus,
   Myotis lucifugus, and M. seprentrionalis), only the latter two were
   detected or captured. Myotis bats were recorded with detectors at 87\%
   of the riparian sample sites, although at relatively low levels (mean of
   19.4 commuting passes/hr). These detector results suggest that myotis
   bats are ubiquitous, yet not very abundant in western Newfoundland. Most
   captures were of M lucifugus (66\%, n = 30), yet M, septentrionalis
   appear to be more common than previously thought, representing 34\% (n =
   15) of the captures. Myotis bats roosted in holes (n = 4), in cracks (n
   = 2), and under loose bark (n = 2) of standing dead trees, generally
   close to cutblock edges and sources of water (presumably foraging
   sites). Compared to those trees available (based on random transects in
   cutblocks and forests), bats did not appear to select roost trees based
   on many of the characteristics I measured (\% bark remaining, diameter
   at breast height, stand slope, or species group (deciduous or conifer)).
   However, bats tended to select roost trees of smaller height classes
   (0-5 and 11-15 m) and with greater numbers of cavities than those
   available. Because most roosts were located along edge habitat, forest
   harvesting may increase accessibility to roosts for some bats by
   creating corridors and openings through the forest. However, it is still
   unclear how habitat fragmentation and loss of forested areas may affect
   but populations.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the ongoing ecological monitoring initiatives at Pukaskwa
   National Park, Ontario, park staff have been monitoring Pitcher's
   Thistle (Cirsium pitcheri, Asteraceae) annually since 1981. This species
   is endemic to the Great Lakes region and is considered ``threatened{''}
   by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada
   (COSEWIC). Over 17 years, the population has fluctuated greatly
   (mean=401.7 plants with a standard deviation of 182.9). This fluctuation
   is attributed to the bursting of an upstream braver dam in 1986 that
   wiped out much of the colony along the stream banks. The population
   remained low (< 300 total plants) for five years before rebounding in
   1991, reaching a peak of 497 plants, in 1996. Although natural
   succession is of concern, there is no reason to believe that the
   population will not survive under current management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Serum progesterone and testosterone concentrations were measured during
   different stages of oestrous and pregnancy in paired and unpaired female
   common voles (Microtus ar arvalis). Hormone concentrations were measured
   by ELISA, and cycle stages were determined by vaginal smears. Paired
   females usually had serum progesterone concentrations of more than 10
   ng/ml in the oestrous cycle. A significant maximum was detected in
   prooestrous (51.70 +/- 7.54 ng/ml, mean /- S.D.). Serum progesterone
   concentrations increased from about 40 ng/ml at the beginning of
   pregnancy to about 70 ng/ml on days 15 and 16. The last 2 days before
   parturition (days 19 and 20) were characterised by a decrease of
   progesterone concentrations to ca. 30 ng/ml. The maximum concentration
   of testosterone was found in prooestrous (1.58 +/- 0.31 ng/ml).
   Concentrations during pregnancy varied between 1.5 and 2.1 ng/ml. In two
   of three cases unpaired females exhibited progesterone values below 10
   ng/ml, but with varying vaginal smear patterns. The combination of
   progesterone concentrations and vaginal smear patterns was found to be
   regular in only 23.8\% of the cases. The most frequent cycle stage found
   was the oestrous (44.2\%). Mean concentrations of progesterone (10.43
   +/- 13.81 ng/ml) and testosterone (0.85 +/- 1.11 ng/ml) in unpaired
   females were significantly lower than in paired females, thereby
   denoting reproductive inactivity in the former. The study presents basic
   data for several parameters of the reproductive biology in the common
   vole and confirms the importance of combining hormone assays and vaginal
   smear monitoring in reproductive research. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Several increasingly popular paradigms in conservation remove organismal
   information and life-history requirements from management planning with
   claims that species-specific information is not necessary to the
   understanding and management of ``ecosystem function{''} and may
   therefore be discarded. Although several authors have called attention
   to the fact that ecosystem management has not yet been articulated
   sufficiently to comprise an adequate paradigm for wildlife protection,
   there has been a series of suggestions paralleling ecosystem
   management's popularity that the perceived or imagined emergent
   properties of communities should be at the root of conservation
   planning. Such reductions most commonly take the form of abstracted
   species diversity measures that may be irrelevant or misleading with
   respect to site-specific planning and to the monitoring of specific
   management treatments. Following earlier examinations of ecosystem
   management, I emphasize that several of its apparent outgrowths may be
   too vague to inform specific recommendations, that the historical
   mechanics of ``ecosystem processes{''} are essentially unknowable, and
   that anecdotal definitions of ecosystems allow one to justify virtually
   any protocol as management. The primacy of process-dependent,
   landscape-functional considerations in conservation planning is specious
   in the absence of species- and population-specific information, which
   should form the foundation fro understanding such processes in the first
   place. Only by viewing nature in terms of the relationships between
   processes and organisms, rather than in terms of emergent properties of
   organismal assemblages or abiotic factors divorced from organismal data,
   can conservation plans claim to protect biological elements.}},

Abstract = {{For marine species with open populations, patterns of larval settlement
   can have important consequences for performance and abundance at later
   life-stages. In this study, I tested whether larvae of a reef-dwelling
   goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum) settled differentially to reefs
   occupied by varying numbers of adults. I monitored settlement daily to
   reefs on which the density of adult gobies varied naturally, or was
   manipulated experimentally. Rates of settlement were constant across a
   broad range of adult densities, suggesting that larvae do not choose
   settlement sites based on the number of adults in their immediate
   vicinity.}},

Abstract = {{I used a reciprocal sowing experiment in the held to reveal
   differentiation in adaptive traits between two neighbouring northern
   populations of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. I compared a peat bog
   population with a mineral soil population. Seedling survival was
   monitored during seven growing seasons and the plants were then
   harvested to obtain data on pine traits associated with growth and
   resource allocation, i.e. height, needle length, total dry weight,
   relative growth, proportion root and proportion needles. Seeds From the
   pear bog populations had lower germination capacity and were smaller
   than those from the mineral soil population. Despite their smaller size,
   the seeds from the bog population were superior for establishment of
   pines on the bog. On the mineral soil, the traits were strikingly
   similar in the two pine populations. In contrast, the traits were more
   variable and differentiated on the bog. Here, the native bog pines grew
   faster and had a larger proportion root than those originating from the
   population on the adjacent mineral soil. It is suggested that the
   differentiation between peat bog populations and mineral soil
   populations might represent a major direction of differentiation in
   northern Scots pine populations.}},

Abstract = {{Host specialization plays a central role in the diversification of
   herbivorous insects and yet we know very little about the evolution of
   this trait. Populations of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris),
   are specialized and locally adapted to either alfalfa or clover.
   Preference for either plant produces assortative mating, and gene flow
   between alfalfa and clover populations is consistently restricted (Via,
   1991a,b, 1994). Behavioural studies of freely-moving aphids on the plant
   surface for 30 min suggest that host preference is chemically mediated,
   involves chemoreception, and is most likely due to secondary compounds
   located in the epidermal or mesophyll cells. Pea aphids do not
   distinguish between hosts and non-hosts at a distance but determine
   whether the plant is suitable or not after only a short probe.
   Thirty-minute recordings of the activities of aphid stylets using an
   electrical monitoring system (EPG), where aphids are attached to a gold
   wire with silver paint, provide a different picture, suggesting that EPG
   experiments do not accurately reflect natural behaviour during the first
   30 min of the aphid-plant interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Biological monitoring of the Fly River system in Papua New Guinea has
   shown that floodplain habitats (oxbow lakes, blocked valley lakes and
   seasonally inundated grassed floodplain) support diverse and abundant
   populations of freshwater fishes. Since monitoring first commenced in
   the early 1980's, a total of 66 fish species representing 33 families
   has been sampled, with gillnets and rotenone, from a range of sites
   located on the floodplains of the Fly and Strickland rivers. The fish
   fauna was dominated by catfishes in the families Ariidae (11 species)
   and Plotosidae (7 species), with aquatic invertivores being the dominant
   feeding group. Herring species (Nematalosa spp.) were often very
   abundant in the oxbow lakes, forming 66\% of the total catch in all the
   floodplain habitats. The fish communities in the oxbow lakes and blocked
   valley lakes were distinctly different, with several of the smaller fish
   species being more abundant in the blocked valley lakes, while the oxbow
   lakes supported more of the larger predatory species. Catches in the
   oxbow lakes were also generally higher and more diverse than the blocked
   valley lakes or grassed floodplain sites. Since the commencement of
   monitoring, catches from the floodplain sites have varied considerably,
   both spatially and temporally. Reduced catches seen at some sites are
   probably associated with natural climatic factors, particularly `El
   Nino' - induced droughts and algal blooms. Introduced species and
   increased commercial and artisanal fishing may also be affecting stocks
   of native fish. Fish populations were shown to recover only slowly in
   lakes affected by severe drought conditions, with extensive mats of
   floating grasses hindering fish recolonisation. Fish stocks in a lake
   affected by an algal bloom recovered more quickly than stocks in lakes
   affected by drought.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{55}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between fluoride-induced lesions, measured using an
   incremental scoring system, and fluoride concentration was investigated
   in the teeth of the field vole (Microtus agrestis). Both the magnitude
   of lesion score and the severity of observed lesions in both incisor and
   molar teeth was correlated with the respective tissue fluoride
   concentration. This: relationship was observed not only in animals
   trapped from sites contaminated by industrial fluorides, but also those
   bred and maintained under laboratory conditions and consuming fluoride
   in either diet or drinking water. Although some variation occurred
   between field and laboratory animals as to the mean fluoride
   concentrations in the incisor or molar for each specific lesion score,
   this may result in part from differences in the nature of the
   assimilable fluoride in laboratory diets compared to those consumed by
   wild animals. The practical application of the relationship between
   dental lesion score and tissue fluoride concentration to monitoring
   environmental fluoride contamination is discussed, Because the incisor
   and molar teeth of the field voles are open-rooted and grow throughout
   life, they are sensitive to even minor temporal changes in fluoride
   concentration in tissue fluids and blood and, by inference, in the diet
   and the environment. Therefore, assessment of visual lesions in the
   dentition of wild-caught field voles may provide the basis of a scheme
   to monitor the magnitude and effects of environmental fluoride
   contamination on populations of wild and domestic mammals. The
   development of nondestructive methods to allow the repeated examination
   of the teeth of captured field voles, and hence the dynamic monitoring
   of environmental fluoride contamination, is also considered.}},

   The composition of the cecal flora of LF rabbits was stable for a long

   the SPF rabbits, different types of bacteria, e.g., enterobacteriaceae
   and streptococci, which could not be isolated in the isolator were
   detected at a low population level at an early stage in the
   establishment of the SPF colonies, but the basic composition of the
   cecal flora was mainly bacteroidaceae and clostridia and did not change
   over a long period, and the floral composition became similar to that of
   CV rabbits. The fertility and weaning rates of the SPF rabbits were
   satisfactory for a SPF rabbit colony. In addition, these SPF colonies
   were free of more than one year rabbit-specific pathogens.}},

Title = {{Contramensal interactions between two collembolan species: effects on

Abstract = {{1, In the laboratory, a microcosm experiment was set up to study (1) the
   interaction between two collembolan species Onychiurus furcifer (Borner)
   and Heteromurus nitidus (Templeton) during 24 weeks of incubation; (2)
   the influence of slug (Arion rufus L.) cast material on the outcome of
   this interaction; and (3) the influence of collembolan activity on
   microbial biomass, respiration and nutrient mobilization.
   2. The CO, production was monitored every other week and NH4+, NO3- and
   PO43- contents of leachates were determined every 4 weeks. After 12 and
   2 1 weeks of incubation, the number of collembolans, basal respiration
   (O-2 consumption), microbial biomass (substrate-induced respiration
   method), specific respiration (qO(2)) and the content of NH4+, NO3- and
   PO43- in soil were determined.
   3, Generally, the number of collembolans in microcosms with cast
   material exceeded that of microcosms without cast material considerably
   on average by factors of 20 and 26 for O. furcifer and H. nitidus,
   respectively. This increase was attributed to the additional food supply
   provided with the cast material. Numbers of collembolans declined during
   the experiment.
   4. At both sampling dates, the presence of H. nitidus led to a reduction
   in the number of O, furcifer, whereas H, nitidus benefited from the
   presence of O, furcifer. Either trophic or non-trophic mechanisms, or
   both, may have caused this interaction (contramensalism, sensu Arthur \&
   Mitchell 1989).
   5. Both collembola species caused a decrease in microbial respiration,
   decomposition rates and tentatively also microbial biomass at high
   densities, whereas at low densities microbial respiration was stimulated
   while decomposition rates and microbial biomass remained unaffected.
   These effects were more pronounced for O.furcifer than for H, nitidus.
   6, In treatments with cast material N-mobilization was increased by
   collembolan activity.}},

Abstract = {{Infestation with Ostrinia nubilalis (Hb.), the European corn borer (ECB)
   can be detected by using different sampling techniques in the field and
   statistical models aimed to assess the development time of ECB larvae
   and crop damage. An appropriate monitoring for this polyphagous species
   to show a relationship between the kind of sampling or a model and the
   subsequent damage in a particular crop, is very difficult. Sex pheromone
   traps, generally, are also not reliable for monitoring ECB. The
   possibility of employing new types of traps baited with a sex pheromone
   and a maize kairomone, the phenylacetaldheyde (PAA) (multibaited traps)
   was investigated. In sweet corn, trapping experiments were conducted
   over a 2-year period with two kinds of cone traps (XLa and XLb) set up
   at the borders of fields (four replicates). ECB attacks of first and
   second generation larvae were evaluated in the corn ears as a percentage
   of damage and using a damage index (DI). A correlation was found between
   the number of females caught per trap and either the percentage of
   damaged ears (r = 0.73 for XLa; r = 0.65 for XLb) and the DI (r = 70 for
   XLa; r = 0.60 for XLb). Conversely, the number of males caught per trap
   was not correlated with ECB larval damage. A linear model of multiple
   correlation fitted to the data of simultaneous captures of males and
   females showed that the coefficients were not higher than simple
   correlation. The correlation coefficients obtained by fitting a
   curvilinear response surface were higher (r = 0.81 for XLa and r = 0.84
   for XLb, respectively, related to percentage of damaged ears; r = 0.79
   for XLa and r = 0.76 for XLb, respectively, related to DI) thus
   indicating that the simultaneous counting of males and females in cone
   traps can be an efficient and simple monitoring tool.}},

Abstract = {{The probing and feeding behavior of 2 biotypes (B and Q) of the
   sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), were monitored using
   the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique on tomato, Lycopersicon
   esculentum (Mill) ('Riofuego'). Seven EPG waveform patterns were
   distinguished. B. tabaci (B biotype) showed a shorter duration of
   potential drop pattern (4.73 +/- 0.45 s {[} mean +/- SE], n = 125),
   longer time to reach the phloem (209 +/- 23.42 min, n = 22),and more
   complex pathway patterns than the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes
   vaporariorum (Westwood). Some differences were observed in feeding
   behavior of the 2 B, tabaci biotypes (B and Q) tested. Interestingly,
   significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in those parameters
   related with phloem events: total duration of the E(pd),E(pd)1,and
   E(pd)2 (P<0.01), as well as mean duration of E(pd) and E(pd)B. In
   addition, there also were significant differences in the total number of
   probes (P < 0.05). The Q biotype showed fewer number of probes and a
   longer phloem ingestion time (pattern E(pd)B) than those from the B
   biotype. Hence, our results revealed a clear difference in the probing
   and feeding behavior between the B and the Q biotypes of B. tabaci on
   tomato plants.}},

Abstract = {{Plantation pine production in the Great Lakes region of the United
   States is often affected by a pine root weevil complex consisting of
   Hylobius pales (:Herbst) and Pachylobius picivorus (Germar), which breed
   in dead and dying host material, and H. radicis Buchanan and H.
   assimilis (Miller, Benjamin \& Warner), which attack and breed in
   healthy host tissue. Baited pitfall traps were used to assess temporal
   and spatial changes in weevil populations in newly planted clear-cut
   stands over a 2-yr period. The number of weevils breeding: in dying
   tissue comprised the majority of total weevils trapped, but their
   percentage of the total declined drastically by the 2nd yr because the
   slash used for brood development was used: or became too degraded. The
   number of weevils attacking healthy host tissue became more prevalent by
   year 2, as the volatiles emanating from the newly established seedlings
   became more predominant. There was a positive relationship between the
   number of weevils trapped in year 1 and the number of weevils; trapped
   in year 2. A slow-release bait dispensing system was analyzed using
   specific synthetic compounds as baits. The synthetic
   alpha-pinene-ethanol mixture in slow-release polyethylene vials proved
   effective for monitoring the pine root weevil complex in recently
   planted clearcuts. The regional variability of weevil response to baited
   pitfall traps and the feasibility of using these traps to monitor pine
   root weevils in clearcut plantations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance of Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus serratus
   and F: vesiculosus were described at four sheltered, rocky shores in the
   south of the Isle of Man. Canopy removal experiments were performed at
   mid tide level of one sheltered, canopy dominated shore to investigate
   the interactions between the dominant canopy alga, Ascophyllum nodosum
   and the competitively inferior canopy species of Fucus serratus and F.
   vesiculosus. Ascophyllum was removed from replicated plots, 2x2m in
   size, in both winter and summer; the early growth and survival of
   fucoids in the presence and absence of the Ascophyllum canopy were
   monitored and the eventual development of a new canopy described.
   Juveniles of F. serratus originally present beneath the undisturbed
   canopy of Ascophyllum died following canopy removal but new recruitment
   resulted in some canopy development, principally in the winter
   experiment. Fucus vesiculosus, despite being completely excluded from
   the Ascophyllum zone of all four shores described, dominated the canopy
   removal plots of both winter and summer experiments. The Ascophyllum
   canopy did not recover over a five year period of observation, although
   a considerable increase in the abundance of Ascophyllum juveniles
   occurred.}},

Abstract = {{For the regeneration niche to contribute to the maintenance of species
   diversity interspecific differences in sensitivity of seedling
   recruitment to environmental conditions is assumed. We experimentally
   tested differences between meadow species for the response of seed
   germination to chilling, and sensitivity of seedling recruitment to
   microscale heterogeneity. We also compared the dynamics of seedling
   recruitment in gaps. Seed germination was tested in standard laboratory
   germination tests, comparing control seeds with seeds chilled at +4
   degrees C, and at -14 degrees C for one month. Species responses varied
   from significant increases in germinability after chilling (e.g. Cirsium
   palustre, Betonica officinalis, Angelica sylvestris) to significant
   decreases (e.g. Hieracium umbellatum, Succisa pratensis, Selinum
   carvifolia). In some species, chilling at +4 degrees C has a similar
   effect to chilling at -14 degrees C, in others the effect of chilling at
   +4 degrees C was intermediate, and in some, there was no effect of
   chilling at +4 degrees C, but an effect of chilling at -14 degrees C.
   Different chilling temperatures also affect timing and speed of seed
   germination under greenhouse conditions.
   The dynamics of seed germination under field conditions was studied by
   sowing seeds into artificially created gaps and following their
   germination, both where the seedlings were removed after emergence and
   where they were not removed. Species differ in their germination
   dynamics: they all start late April, but then differentiate from an
   abrupt maximum and early finish of germination (in the second half of
   May), to prolonged germination without a marked maximum. Seedling
   removal increased the total number of germinated seeds, with a marked
   density dependence at this stage. Seeds were also sown into plots with
   treatments (1) gaps, sod stripped, above-ground vegetation removed; (2)
   mown, moss layer removed; (3) mown; (4) untouched control. Seedling
   emergence was monitored for 3 yr. Seedling recruitment decreased from
   treatments (1) to (4), but sensitivity differed between species. With
   increasing seed weight, the difference between gaps and other treatments
   decreased. The results show that there are considerable differences in
   seedling recruitment sensitivity between species.}},

Abstract = {{Because the interior population of least tem (Sterna antillarum) was
   listed as endangered in 1985, information on population status, trends,
   and productivity is needed to guide management of this population. We
   compared recent estimates (1986-95) of tern numbers to objectives
   identified in the Recovery Plan, used linear regression to estimate
   trends for local areas (e.g., river segment, reservoir), anti route
   regression to estimate trends for larger segments of the breeding range.
   We also compared observed estimates of fledging success to the minimum
   valve (0.51 fledglings/pair) thought necessary for population
   maintenance to determine whether observed productivity could support
   recent population trends. Although the interior population exceeded the
   recovery goal of 7,000 birds in 1995, this was due to large increases in
   tern numbers along a 901-km stretch of the Lower Mississippi River, and
   numbers for most breeding areas have not reached recovery levels. Trend
   (lambda) was significant for 7 (5 positive, 2 negative) of 31 local
   areas for which trend could be calculated. At larger scales, lambda was
   not discernibly different from 1 for the Platte and Missouri river
   drainages, but lambda was >1 for the Lower Mississippi River drainage.
   Overall trend for the interior population was 1.090 (95\% CI =
   1.056-1.111), and 1.024 (95\% CI = 0.998-1.045) when data from the Lower
   Mississippi River were excluded. Fledging; success ranged from 0.00 to
   2.33 fledglings/pair, and was <0.51 in 9 areas. Based on available
   fledging success estimates, there is no evidence that productivity
   within the interior range caused recent increases in tern numbers.
   Improved rangewide monitoring of numbers and productivity, and
   information on movements and postfledging survival, are needed to assess
   recovery criteria and management options for this population of least
   terns.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to measure reproductive hormones in urine and feces permits
   physiologic evaluations of free-ranging animal populations. The data
   from previous reports indicate specific events such as gonadal
   recrudescence, ovulation, conception, pregnancy, and lactation can be
   detected and defined by fecal hormone analysis in a wide range of
   animals. The present study was undertaken to determine if combined data
   from a longitudinal and cross-sectional hormonal study of free-ranging
   cow tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes) and simultaneously collected
   observational data would permit an accurate estimation of the pregnancy
   rate of the population. Ovarian and placental function were monitored in
   34 radiocollared cow tule elk from the onset of ovarian recrudescence in
   the summer of 1996, through the calving season in the spring of 1997.
   Estrogen and progesterone metabolites were measured by enzyme
   immunoassay (EIA) in fecal samples collected from both radiocollared and
   uncollared cows. The radiocollared cows were located and identified for
   individualized observations of fecal deposition and later confirmation
   of pregnancy by observation of nursing. Hormonal concentrations from the
   samples collected from the radiocollared cows in which pregnancy and
   outcome were known were used to set criteria for designation of a cow as
   pregnant in the cross-sectional samples collected from a population of
   approximately 208 uncollared cows. Progesterone metabolite (PdG)
   concentrations were 100\% reliable at predicting pregnancy within the
   first trimester of gestation through parturition, while estrogen
   metabolite (E1C) concentrations were not a reliable indicator until the
   last trimester of gestation. A progesterone metabolite concentration
   greater than or equal to 1.01 ug/g dry mass feces (dmf) after the
   breeding season was set as confirmation of pregnancy status in fecal
   samples collected From uncollared cows. Analysis of hormonal
   concentrations after the 1997 calving season in conjunction with
   observations of nursing permitted pregnancy detection estimates via the
   calving rate of the collared cows for the 1996-97 breeding and calving
   season. These same parameters were estimated and evaluated in the
   uncollared cows. Our results provide strong evidence that the measure of
   fecundity in free-ranging animals can be obtained through fecal steroid
   analyses, and that this measure is an accurate predictor of fertility.}},

Abstract = {{We undertook migration monitoring surveys and analysis of long-term
   banding data to determine if there was a significant premolt movement of
   Canada geese (Branta canadensis) from restored and reintroduced
   populations in southern Canada and midcontinent United States into
   northern Ontario and western James Bay. We examined migration
   chronology, origins, and demographic characteristics of molt migration
   of Canada geese in northern Ontario and on Akimiski Island, Northwest
   Territories. From 1985 to 1989, a conspicuous northward migration of
   large Canada geese was documented throughout northern Ontario from
   mid-May to the end of June, well after the April migration of the
   subarctic nesting subspecies of Canada geese (B. c. Interior); most
   nesting interior Canada geese in the Hudson Bay and James Bay lowlands
   were incubating eggs at this time. Summer-banded Canada geese
   originating from populations in 26 states and 6 Canadian provinces were
   captured in coastal areas of James Bay and Hudson Bay between the
   borders of Quebec and Manitoba. Morphometric discrimination indicated
   the presence of molting giant Canada geese (B. c. maxima). Most foreign,
   summer-banded birds were yearlings (53\%) and 2-year-olds (17\%), but
   birds up to 15 years old were captured. Approximately 58\% of
   2-15-year-old females had brood patches, which indicated a nesting
   attempt in the year of recapture. We suggest that increasing populations
   of giant Canada geese and declining habitat availability on northern
   brood-rearing areas will result in increasing levels of competition
   between populations of Canada geese. Presence of molt migrants on
   northern breeding areas will also complicate management of some Arctic
   and subarctic nesting populations of Canada geese.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the effect of interactions between predation
   and hunting on the rate of game bird mortality throughout the year. We
   monitored 134 radiotagged willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus lagopus) on 3
   contiguous areas, 2 nonhunted and 1 hunted, in central Sweden between
   1992 and 1995. We recorded 100 known mortalities: 22 from hunting, 40
   from raptors, 19 from mammalian predators, and 19 from other causes.
   Excluding hunting, cause of death was similar on hunted and nonhunted
   areas (P > 0.5), with raptors the most important cause of death in all
   seasons. We did not record any deaths due to mammalian predators in
   winter or spring, and deaths through collision with power lines only
   affected winter, but not annual, survival rates. Cox proportional hazard
   modeling revealed season (autumn, winter-spring, summer) and area
   (hunted, nonhunted) as the only variables to affect risk of death (P <
   0.001). The greatest rates of hunting mortality (0.24) and natural
   predation (0.32) occurred on the hunted area during autumn. Autumn
   survival on the hunted area (0.49) was lower (P = 0.029) that on the
   nonhunted areas (0.71). Survival increased in winter-spring to 0.69 on
   the hunted area and 0.81 on the nonhunted areas, and remained high
   (>0.78) through the summer period. We believe hunting mortality was
   mostly, if not totally, additive to natural mortality in our study. The
   population density on the hunted area did not decline as expected from
   the results, and we suggest that immigration from beyond the neighboring
   nonhunted areas was sustaining the population. We conclude that a
   harvest model for willow grouse must take account for dispersal and
   predation rates at a landscape scale.}},

Abstract = {{Exfoliated skin was collected from bowriding dolphins with the use of a
   sterilized nylon scrub pad affixed to a wooden dowel. Initial tests of
   the effectiveness of the technique and dolphin behavioral responses were
   conducted on dusky dolphins off Kaikoura, New Zealand. During 14
   sampling days, 128 contacts using this procedure were made with
   bowriding dolphins, of which 114 showed behavioral response. Responses
   during sampling were mild, with 11\% of contacted individuals showing no
   visible response, and 66\% of individuals which could be monitored for
   30 sec after contact returning to bowride within 30 sec. Mean return
   time was 10 sec postcontact and did not vary significantly for groups of
   different sizes. Behavioral controls suggest that a proportion of
   responses could be explained by typical dolphin behavior in the presence
   of boats. Seventy-eight percent of contacts resulted in successful
   collection of tissue samples. Sample time was three minutes on average.
   Size of group and behavioral state did not appear to influence sample
   time. Preliminary genetic analyses revealed that tissue collected by
   this technique was suitable for amplification and sequencing of
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) via,in PCR. Comparisons of mtDNA control
   region sequences with those from known L.obscurus and other delphinid
   samples verified that this technique was robust against contamination
   from elements in sea water.}},

Abstract = {{We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals,
   Phoca vitulina richardsi, in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the
   1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out
   sites during the annual mole period each year from 1990 through 1997. A
   generalized linear model indicated that time of day, dare, and time
   relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson
   regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey
   conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6\% per
   year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically
   significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals
   on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining
   since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63\%
   through 1997.
   Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sites should
   account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of
   abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can
   improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is the primary tool used in restoring and maintaining suitable
   habitat for the endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa
   samuelis Nabokov) and its sole larval host plant, wild lupine (Lupinus
   perennis L.), at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. To minimize the
   possible detrimental effects of fire on Karner blue butterfly
   populations, managers at the national lakeshore have developed fire
   management strategies to prevent complete mortality of isolated
   populations and maximize the speed of repopulation following burns.
   Butterfly sites are divided int three or more burn units, and adjacent
   units are not burned in successive years to provide opportunity for
   repopulation. Burns conducted in areas known to support Karner blue
   butterfly populations contain at least one fire exclusion area. Fire
   exclusion areas are small, open habitat patches containing lupine that
   intentionally remain unburned to protect eggs and larvae from
   potentially lethal effects of fire. If fire causes Karner blue butterfly
   mortality, fire exclusion areas serve as refuges within burn areas and
   reduce flight distances required for recolonization of portions of
   burned units. Populations were monitored by walk-through surveys to
   determine trends and to identify significant changes in butterfly
   abundance. Survey results suggest that relatively fewer Karner blue
   butterflies are present in recently burned areas than in unburned areas.
   However, butterflies were found within burn units during the first brood
   following prescribed fires, and walk-through surveys indicate that
   Karner blue butterfly populations survive Indiana Dunes National
   Lakeshore's fire management methods.}},

Abstract = {{Many gulls (Larus spp.) that nest on and north of the Great Lakes
   concentrate along the south shore of western Lake Erie in early winter.
   Monitoring population trends of these gulls is important because of
   increasing conflicts between gulls and humans. We used data from four
   Christmas Bird Count locations to examine population trends of four gull
   species on western Lake Erie during nine 5-year periods, 1951-1995.
   Overall, ring-billed gulls (L. delawarensis) were the dominant species
   (59\% of gulls counted) followed by herring (L, argentatus, 20\%),
   Bonaparte's (L, philadelphia, 18\%) and great black-backed (L, marinus,
   0.2\%) gulls. Ring-billed gulls displayed the most dramatic population
   changes over the 45-year period, increasing 23-fold (P <0.05) from
   1951-1955 to 1981-1985. The population then declined (P <0.05) by 57\%
   from 1981-1985 to 1991-1995, Population trends for Bonaparte's gulls
   followed the same general pattern as ring-billed gulls. Herring gulls
   showed an 11-fold increase (P <0.05) from 1951-1955 to 1971-1975 (10
   years before the ring-billed and Bonaparte's peak) followed by a
   decline. Great black-backed gulls showed slight (P >0.05) increases
   among 5-year periods from 1951-1990 with a 3.3-fold increase (P <0.05)
   from 1986-1990 to 1991-1995, Early winter numbers of herring,
   ring-billed, and Bonaparte's gulls have stabilized or declined from peak
   numbers recorded. on western Lake Erie in the 1970s and 1980s whereas
   great black-backed gull population numbers have increased. Continued
   monitoring of both early winter and nesting populations, combined with
   studies of feeding habits and migratory patterns, are needed to evaluate
   long-term trends of Great Lakes gull populations and to provide a
   foundation for management programs to resolve gull-human conflicts.}},

Abstract = {{The return of the Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx to Oman symbolized the
   success of a new approach to species conservation and established
   reintroduction as a conservation tool. Ten years after the species had
   been exterminated in the wild by poaching, the first 10 founder oryx,
   descendants of the `World Herd', were reintroduced to the desert,in
   central Oman in January 1982. A second release followed in 1984 and the
   population grew slowly through a 3-year drought that was broken by rain
   in. June 1986. Further years of good rainfall and more founders meant
   that by April 1990 there were over 100 oryx in the wild, independent of
   supplementary feed and water, and using a range of over 11,000 sq km. At
   that time a new monitoring programme was implemented that allowed the
   transition from individual- to population-based monitoring and
   management. The population continued to grow and by October 1995
   numbered approximately 280 in the wild (of which 22 were surviving
   founders) and used over 16,000 sq km of the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary.
   However; in February 1996 poaching resumed and oryx were captured for
   sale as live animals outside the country. Despite the poaching the
   population continued to increase and by October 1996 was estimated to be
   just over 400. However, poaching intensified and continued through late
   1996 and 1997. By September 1998 it had reduced the wild population to
   an estimated 138 animals, of which just 28 were females. The wild
   population was no longer considered viable and action was taken to
   rescue some of the remaining animals from the wild to form a captive
   herd.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of pyrethroid resistance in a field population of cotton
   bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) was demonstrated by continuous
   monitoring with twin discriminating dosages, and the influencing factors
   were also experimentally analysed. Resistance in a Field population in
   China increased rapidly in the 3rd and 4th generations when population
   density became higher and insecticides were applied repeatedly, then
   decreased suddenly during over-wintering and slowly in the 1st and 2nd
   generations when insecticide spraying was suspended. Resistance increase
   could be countered by dilution as a result of immigration of susceptible
   moths from corn fields, which were found to be a natural refuge for this
   pest in China. The reduction of resistance during over-wintering and the
   1st and 2nd generations was affected by the lower fitness of resistant
   cotton bollworms to low temperature and disadvantages in reproduction.
   The possibilities of managing the resistance in field populations on the
   basis of these observations are discussed. (C) 1999 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {{Widespread use of Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca to improve native
   pastures in northern Australia makes it necessary to monitor changes in
   the anthracnose pathogen, Collerotrichum gloeosporioides, because new
   damaging races have arisen to devastate many agronomically promising
   cultivars in the past. A total of 103 isolates collected during the past
   20 years were analyzed by using virulence and molecular markers to
   determine whether aggressive strains have evolved in the field. Data on
   severity for eight host differentials were obtained from a greenhouse
   assay and analyzed by linear discriminant functions developed from
   existing data on 182 isolates of known races. A molecular analysis of a
   subset of 21 isolates by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and
   electrophoretic karyotyping gave comparable results for both markers,
   although electrophoretic karyotyping detected a higher level of
   polymorphism. The majority of the 103 isolates were placed into three
   groups on the basis of RAPD analysis. Virulence analysis detected
   isolates that were highly aggressive toward Seca. During the past 20
   years, the frequency of aggressive isolates has increased. Many of the
   aggressive isolates were collected during the 1990s, and one had a
   distinct RAPD genotype. The lack of a strong association between RAPD
   genotypes and pathogen races suggests that races have arisen
   independently within each genetic group. This work highlights the need
   for regular monitoring of the pathogen population.}},

Abstract = {{A significant negative relationship between tiller height and resistance
   to Fusarium ear blight (FEB), following inoculation, was observed in 17
   cultivars of winter wheat in the 1995/96 growing season. Tall cultivars
   such as Kraka and Spark showed fewer symptoms of FEB (6 and 4\%) than
   the shorter cultivars Brigadier and Virtue (35 and 51\%). To determine
   if this relationship was caused by a genetic association or an effect of
   the microclimate, height and disease were measured in segregating
   populations derived from tallxshort cultivars and humidity was measured
   in near-isogenic lines with and without the Rht1 and Rht2 dwarfing
   genes. Among random F-3 populations there was a clear tendency for tall
   strawed lines to show less severe disease symptoms than shorter strawed
   lines following inoculation. The effect of the individual dwarfing genes
   Rhr1 and Rht2 on the severity of FEB was also studied in an inoculation
   trial using a number of near-isogenic lines of Maris Huntsman and Maris
   Widgeon. Within isogenic lines of Maris Huntsman, there was a clear
   tendency for tall straw to be associated with fewer symptoms, but this
   was not apparent within lines of Maris Widgeon. Monitoring relative
   humidity at ear height in a short and tall isogenic line of Maris
   Huntsman revealed no significant differences between these genotypes
   from GS 65 to GS 85, suggesting that microclimate cannot explain
   differences in severity of FEB between these lines. It is suggested that
   there are independent genes affecting the severity of FEB that may allow
   plant breeders to select resistant cultivars of any height.}},

Abstract = {{Isozyme analysis of seed samples derived from natural and managed
   populations of the tropical pine Pinus caribaea vars `bahamensis' and
   `caribaea' was used to assess population genetic structure in its native
   range and to detect changes occurring during early domestication of the
   species. Baseline data from natural populations of the two varieties
   showed that populations sampled as seed are characterized by high gene
   diversity (mean H-e = 0.26) and a low level of inbreeding( mean F-is =
   0.15). A UPGMA tree of genetic relatedness among populations indicates
   that the two varieties represent distinct evolutionary units. Within
   each variety there is significant differentiation among populations, and
   this is greater for the more fragmented populations of var `bahamensis'
   (F-st = 0.08) than for var `caribaea' (F-st = 0.02). Seed from a seed
   orchard population of var `caribaea' established within its natural
   range showed no change in genetic diversity but did show a reduced
   inbreeding coefficient (F-is = 0.09) compared with its progenitor
   populations, suggesting a decrease in selfing and/or biparental
   inbreeding. A bulked seed sample from an exotic plantation of var
   `bahamensis' in Australia displayed a large increase in the inbreeding
   coefficient (F-is = 0.324) compared with that found in natural
   populations, possibly due to elevated self-fertilization. Finally, a
   bulked seed sample from an exotic plantation population of var
   `caribaea' from China showed enhanced genetic diversity, an increase in
   the inbreeding coefficient and more linkage disequilibrium than its
   presumed progenitor populations. It was also genetically divergent from
   them. RFLP analysis of chloroplast DNA variation in the Chinese sample
   suggested that seeds of the related taxa P. elliottii and P. taeda, or
   seeds derived from hybridization with these taxa growing in the seed
   production area, had been included in the seed crop during harvesting.
   We conclude that monitoring of appropriate genetic markers may be an
   effective means of identifying potentially deleterious genetic changes
   occurring during forest tree domestication.}},

Abstract = {{We report results from a breeding strategy designed to accumulate
   favorable QTL alleles for grain yield identified in the Steptoe x
   `Morex' (SM) barley germplasm. Two map lines (SM73 and SM145) from the
   original mapping population were selected based on their marker genotype
   and QTL structure. When crossed. these lines would be expected to
   produce progeny with most favorable QTL alleles. One hundred doubled
   haploid (DH) lines from the F-1 hybrid of this cross were enotyped with
   ten RFLP markers and one morphological marker defining grain yield to
   monitor QTL segregation. A subset of 24 lines representing various
   combinations of putatively favorable and unfavorable QTL alleles,
   together with Steptoe,'Morex', SM73, and SM145, were phenotyped for
   grain yield in five environments. Multiple regression procedures were
   used to explore phenotype and genotype relationships. Most target QTLs
   showed significant effects. However, significance and magnitude of QTL
   effects and favorable QTL allele phase varied across environments. All
   target QTLs showed significant QTL-by-environment interaction (QTL x E)?
   and the QTL on chromosome 2 expressed alternative favorable QTL alleles
   in different environments. Digenic epistatic effects were also detected
   between some QTL loci. For traits such as grain yield, marker-assisted
   selection efforts may be better targeted at determining optimum
   combinations of QTL alleles rather than pyramiding alleles detected in a
   reference mapping population.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the activity behaviour and time-budget of a female
   free-ranging lynx (Lynx lynx) in Slovenia during the first five months
   of post-partum from June-October 1995. Activity was monitored by means
   of a radio-collar with activity sensor, employing continuous automatic
   recording and discontinuous time-sampling. A total of 1818 data hours
   was analysed with respect to the prey status, distinguishing between
   days with and without kill, and age of the kittens. On average the
   female was active for 8.5 h per 24-h day. Activity at twilight and
   during daytime was generally higher than during night. On days when the
   female hunted she was more active and more diurnal than on days when she
   had access to a kill. During the later post-partum mobile phase the
   female covered a considerably larger home range, was much more active,
   and showed higher twilight and daytime activity than during the earlier
   stationary phase. Movements to and from a kill occurred irregularly
   throughout the night during the stationary phase, while the whole family
   went to a kill around sunset and returned back around sunrise during the
   mobile phase. When a kill was available, the female spent on average
   81\% of the 24-h day with her kittens, but only 63\% on days with no
   kill. Times of absence from the den did not increase during the
   stationary phase as the kittens grew older. Activity timing is
   interpreted as a highly differential temporal adaptation to meet various
   contrasting challenges, i.e., hunting, defence of kills against
   competitors, protection of young, and home range patrolling. Comparison
   with data from Switzerland suggest that habitat structure in addition is
   likely to shape lynx activity in different areas.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulative field experiments carried out on sheltered rocky shores
   investigated settlement and post-settlement interactions between
   Semibalanus balanoides and three species of fucoid canopy algae, Fucus
   spiralis L., Ascophyllum nodosum (L,) Le Jolis and Fucus serratus L. All
   three species had a negative effect on settlement and early recruitment
   of S. balanoides, densities being significantly lower on settlement
   tiles beneath the canopy compared to cleared areas. Investigation of the
   mechanism by which settlement and recruitment were inhibited showed the
   importance of sweeping of algal fronds at all three shore heights. In
   addition, we found that the F. serratus canopy inhibited settlement not
   only by its sweeping action but also by limiting the access of cyprids
   to the substratum. Detailed examination of the sweeping effect in F.
   serratus showed that newly settled cyprids transplanted beneath a canopy
   suffered extremely high mortality (between 82 and 97\%) over just one
   high water period. Mortality was significantly reduced for individuals
   that had settled within a matrix of adults. Metamorphosis of cyprids to
   spat conferred no additional resistance to sweeping-induced modality but
   resistance increased in 6 day old spat. Mortality in S. balanoides after
   the end of the settlement season was monitored for three months in
   experimental treatments and controls. Mortality rates were significantly
   lower under the canopy than in cleared areas in both the F. spiralis and
   Ascophyllum zones. The overall influence of each canopy species on the
   development of barnacle populations on sheltered shores is discussed.

Abstract = {{Litter fall plays a major role in the cycling of energy and nutrients in
   woodland ecosystems. The amount of litter produced and nutrients
   returned in two population-density trials of Eucalyptus brookerana and
   E. saligna short rotation forests were monitored over a one-year period
   in Palmerston North, New Zealand. The results showed that the higher the
   plant density, the greater the weight of the litter fall and with higher
   levels of nutrients. The differences were less evident after tree canopy
   closure. The highest annual litter fall recorded was >10 Mg ha(-1) oven
   dry, of which leaves contributed over 90\%. Total nitrogen and
   phosphorus return was up to 140 and 8.2 kg ha(-1), respectively. About
   70\% to 80\% of the total annual litter fall occurred during summer
   time. To minimise depletion of nutrients from the site, trees should be
   harvested in autumn or winter to ensure a sustainable production system.
   However, to remove as many nutrients as possible in an effluent land
   treatment system where nutrient removal is the main objective, trees
   should be harvested in summer before the peak time of nutrient return.

Abstract = {{The montane alternative silvicultural systems (MASS) study was
   established to test the feasibility and ecological consequences of
   alternative silvicultural systems in montane old-growth forests of
   coastal British Columbia. The experiment includes replicated treatments
   representing a range of overstory removal (shelterwood, patch clearcut
   and green tree retention), adjacent old-growth and clearcut `control'
   areas and pre- and post-harvest measurement of a variety of ecological
   attributes. In this paper, we report results from vegetation and bird
   studies. Forest trees and understory vegetation were sampled on a series
   of permanent plots. Forest birds were monitored using transect methods
   during winter and point-counts during the breeding season.
   The cover, frequency and number of species of understory plants
   decreased after all harvesting treatments. Three years after harvest,
   cover increased in the harvested areas primarily due to herbaceous
   colonizers. The shelterwood, where understory vegetation was protected
   in undisturbed groups of leave trees, retained the greatest diversity of
   understory trees, shrubs and bryophytes compared to the other systems.
   Shelterwood species richness and abundance were greater 3 years after
   harvesting than before harvesting, but changes in species composition
   were quite variable. Presence of bryophytes and herbs that prefer moist,
   shaded habitats generally decreased after harvesting.
   Pre-harvest breeding bird communities were dominated by a few abundant
   species. Of 26 species detected, 4 species accounted for 64\% of all
   bird detections, and 10 species accounted for 96\%. Different levels of
   canopy retention produced dramatic effects on breeding birds. Species
   richness and bird abundance were reduced 3 years after harvesting. Most
   common species (9 species) showed evidence of population decline, 2
   species showed significant increase, and 3 species showed unchanged
   abundance. Few species were completely lost or added to the avifauna.
   Only 17 species were recorded during winter surveys, of which 2 species
   accounted for the majority (68\%) of detections. The vast majority
   (85\%) of winter resident birds were concentrated in the old growth and
   the unlogged portions of patch-cut blocks. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Relative population levels of the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus
   (L.) (Coleoptera, Scolytidae) and associated insects were estimated in
   12 spruce stands in central Sweden. Spruce bolts and window traps baited
   with semiochemicals were used for the monitoring. Six stands were
   unmanaged and had ongoing attacks on standing trees by I. typographus.
   This had led to an accumulation of dead spruce trees during several
   years. These six stands were compared pairwise with six old-managed
   stands with similar forest structure, but with no attacks during the
   previous years and with low amounts of dead trees. Catches of 17 species
   were included in a quantitative analysis. Four species, all known to be
   common predators in I. typographus galleries, were caught in
   significantly higher numbers in the unmanaged stands (two- to three-fold
   difference). In contrast, the number of I. typographus caught was almost
   identical for the two stand types. Our results indicate that predators
   of the spruce bark beetle may be more sensitive to certain forestry
   operations than their prey. Caging or baiting of bolts strongly
   influenced the colonization of predatory species and the number of I.
   typographus offspring that emerged. Compared to uncaged, unbaited bolts,
   offspring production was ca. 30\% higher in bolts caged with a fine
   nylon netting and ca. 30\% lower in uncaged bolts baited with ethanol
   and alpha-pinene. No difference between stand types was found in the
   production of offspring by I. typographus in the bolts. In a
   multiple-regression analysis, including the density of certain predators
   and of I. typographus galleries, one factor, namely `Thanasimns larvae
   per bolt', could significantly explain some of the variation in I.
   typographus offspring production in the 36 bolts. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Opuntia stricta (Haworth) Haworth and Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller
   are the most prominent of the cactus weeds that have become invasive in
   several countries in Africa. Opuntia stricta has no useful attributes
   but O. ficus-indica is extensively exploited as fodder for livestock and
   fruit for human consumption. Biological control of Opuntia weeds has not
   been attempted in North Africa for fear that introduced agents could
   deplete the valued resources provided by O. ficus-indica. Recent
   confirmation that there are at least two distinct biotypes of
   Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell), each specific to particular groups of
   Opuntia species, has enhanced prospects of O. stricta being controlled
   biologically with no threat to O. ficus-indica. One biotype of D.
   opuntiae, referred to as the `stricta' biotype, only survives on
   low-growing species such as O. stricta while the other, the `ficus'
   biotype, is associated with tree-like cacti, including O. ficus-indica.
   The `stricta' biotype has been used with considerable success for
   biological control of O. stricta in Australia for over 60 years. To
   corroborate the contention that the `stricta' biotype of D. opuntiae
   could be used specifically to control O. stricta, with no threat to
   tree-like opuntias, the development and survival of the insects was
   monitored on several cultivars of O. ficus-indica, including the feral,
   spiniferous form and six spineless forms, Robusta, Fusicaulis, American
   Giant, Gymno Carpo, Algerian and Morado. The study showed that, with one
   possible exception, the O. ficus-indica varieties were unsuitable hosts
   for the `stricta' biotype of D. opuntiae and demonstrated that the
   insects could be used with safety for biological control of O. stricta
   in North Africa.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term study of the population cycles of Helicoverpa armigera
   (Hubner), Tortrix capensana (Walker) and Cryptophlebia leucotreta
   (Meyrick) on citrus at Zebediela was undertaken to establish a
   phenological model for the planning and implementation of control
   strategies. Helicoverpa armigera and T. capensana were monitored with
   light-traps and orchard scouting. In H. armigera the relationships
   between adult activity, oviposition on citrus blossoms, the presence of
   larvae on citrus trees and the correlation between moth activity and
   climatic factors were determined. A correlation between moth activity in
   autumn and pest status in the following spring was demonstrated.
   Although the oviposition levels on Navel blossoms were higher than on
   Valencia, both cultivars were subject to an oviposition peak in the
   first week of September. The larval population peaked on both cultivars
   in the third week of September during full bloom. Larvae appeared
   earlier on Navel and but persisted longer on Valencia. In a simple
   regression analysis, light-trap catches correlated with minimum and
   maximum temperatures, evaporation, and wind and saturation deficit. In a
   multiple regression analysis a positive correlation was demonstrated
   between minimum temperature and wind, and moth catches. The packhouse
   culling figure owing to damage by H. armigera damage for 1986-1993 was
   0.43 \% (S.D. = 0.27) for Navel and 0.29 \% (S.D. = 0.25) for Valencia
   fruit. Tortrix capensana activity in winter and the following spring
   were correlated through light-trap catches. The adult population with
   the highest economic impact on citrus fruit quality occurred in the
   fourth week of September. Larvae produced by these moths appeared two
   weeks later. Subsequent moth generations between December and May were
   of no economic importance. In a simple regression analysis, light-trap
   catches showed the highest positive correlation with ambient
   temperature. In a multiple regression analysis evaporation and rainfall
   correlated positively with moth catches. The packhouse cull averaged
   0.64 \% (S.D. = 0.68 \%) on Navels and 0.52 \% (S.D. = 0.56 \%) on
   Valencias. Lemons were not damaged. Male populations of C. leucotreta
   were monitored with virgin-female traps. The highest moth activity
   occurred in the second week of February. The relationship between moth
   catches and climatic factors were investigated, as well as the pattern
   and number of fruit lost as a result of C. leucotreta in Navel and
   Valencia orchards. The highest single incidence of Navel fruit loss
   occurred in December and Valencia fruit loss in July. In a simple
   regression analysis, weekly moth catches showed a correlation with
   minimum and maximum temperature, evaporation and rainfall. In a multiple
   regression analysis maximum temperature correlated positively and
   evaporation negatively with moth catches. A relationship between moth
   catches and fruit loss was established According to a regression between
   moth catches and Navel fruit loss, a weekly average of 10 males/trap/22
   ha of trees per week resulted in a loss of 0.53 cartons of fruit/ha/week
   four weeks later. The average percentage crop loss due to false codling
   moth was 1.6 \% in Navels and 0.3 \% in Valencias.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to address two wildlife management problems
   in central African rainforests: the need for local communities to take
   responsibility for wildlife management, and the lack of simple and
   appropriate wildlife monitoring techniques. The method uses encounters
   of game species during net hunts to calculate abundance indices as well
   as to estimate population densities for the four principal game species
   in the Dzanga-Sangha region: the duikers Cephalophus monticola
   (10.7-20.4 km(-2)),C. dorsalis (1.2-2.0 km(-2)), and C. callipygus
   (0.9-1.2 km(-2)), and the brush-tailed porcupine Atherurus africanus
   (2.7-5.3 km(-2)). Game species behaviour, the hunting practice, and
   comparisons with results from other research across central Africa
   suggest that the method can provide valid density estimates for C.
   monticola and C. dorsalis, but only abundance indices for C. callipygus
   and A. africanus. Nevertheless, the method can be applied by hunters in
   the course of their normal activities, and is adapted to the local
   habitat types and game species. As such, it can be an important tool for
   local communities in developing sustainable wildlife management
   programmes.}},

Abstract = {{This short review outlines the contribution of modeling techniques,
   particularly physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, in
   promulgating biological monitoring as a practical tool for the
   occupational health professional. The impact of modeling techniques is
   discussed in helping to establish the relevant biomarkers to measure,
   the appropriate time of sampling, and the relationship between
   atmospheric exposure limits and concentration of biological analyte. Of
   particular interest is the use of ``population{''} PBPK techniques.
   These can explore the influence of physiological differences between
   workers or of particular susceptible subgroups (e.g., pregnant women,
   breast-feeding mothers, and infants) on the relationship between
   atmospheric exposure levels and biomarker concentration. Such techniques
   will become more widely used as biological monitoring guidance values
   (e.g., biological exposure indices, biological tolerance values) are
   increasingly established by various international professional and
   regulatory bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Cydia succedana (Denis dt Schiffermuller) has been introduced into New
   Zealand for the biological control of gorse seeds (Ulex europaeus).
   Traps baited with a sex attractant were developed for monitoring the
   flight timing and number of adult male moths and were used as a new tool
   for monitoring the establishment, phenology and efficacy of the agent.
   The best hare tested was (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-yl acetate, although
   high catches were also made with the E,Z isomer. There was no difference
   in the total catch across a range of doses from I to 300 mu g/lure (7151
   insects caught). Male flight was recorded at the bottom, middle and top
   of a hillside between 280 and 370 m altitude, along with the percentages
   of plants at each site bearing flowers and seed pods. There was an
   initial seasonal linkage between the catch of males and plans phenology,
   but a lack of synchrony was evident between the insect and the plant in
   the second generation, indicating a potentially important limitation for
   biological control at this site. The prospects for using sex attractants
   in traps as an aid for monitoring populations of weed biological control
   agents are excellent. Other potential applications include the
   cost-effective detection of establishment and the determination of the
   optimal size of founding populations to ensure establishment of control
   agents.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial structure and dynamics of local populations of an endangered
   specialist butterfly, the cranberry fritillary Boloria aquilonaris
   living on peat bogs was studied in Southern Belgium. Seventeen
   populations an the Ardenne uplands (Plateau des Tailles, Hautes-Fagnes,
   Plateau de Recogne, Plateau de St-Hubert) and one population in the
   forested lowlands of Lorraine were monitored in 1996. The population
   structure and dynamics were investigated on the ``Plateau des
   Tailles{''}, the most important area for B. aquilonaris in Belgium with
   12 distinct populations. A. mark-release-recapture survey was carried
   out on four sites in 1995 and 1996 within an area of 85 km(2). An
   unexpectedly high degree of interchange was detected between sites. This
   connectivity, together with the asynchrony of local dynamics suggest
   that populations act as a single metapopulation within the whole study
   area. We observed that adult butterflies were less prone to move out of
   their natal patch when this patch was small (< 1 ha), isolated and
   sheltered. Therefore, such patches must also be taken into account when
   planning the conservation of the species. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Trapa natans is an aquatic plant native to the Old World. In the late
   1880s this plant was found to be naturalized in the eastern United
   States where it has become an important weed. To evaluate the potential
   of biological control to reduce this weed, surveys for natural enemies
   of Trapa spp. were made in Northeast Asia and Europe, In addition,
   populations of Trapa japonica in South Korea were monitored for one
   season to evaluate the occurrence and impact of insect natural enemies.
   Among the insects found, the leaf beetle Galerucella birmanica was the
   most common and damaging species in Asia. It can cause complete
   defoliation of whole populations of plants. Nymphuline pyralid moths
   were also common and at times damaging. Both the beetle and the moths
   feed and develop on unrelated plants and so have no potential as
   biological control agents of T. natans in North America. Two Nanophyes
   weevils were found in Asia which feed in petiole floats of the leaves.
   They are thought to be specific to Trapa but were not observed to be
   damaging, Low level populations of polyphagous Homoptera were common.
   Chironomid midges were also frequently associated with the plants, but
   for the most part were filter feeders, not herbivores. The greatest
   impact on the monitored plants in South Korea was by the leaf beetle G.
   birmanica which defoliated most of the plants, causing the mats of
   plants to sink. In Europe, a similar and related insect fauna was found,
   but none of the insects was very damaging to the plants. One Italian
   weevil, Bagous rufimanus, feeds within the fruit stems and might be more
   damaging at higher than observed population levels. Some diseases were
   seen on some plants in both regions. European populations of T. natans
   have declined significantly, stimulating conservation efforts.
   Literature records of Trapa insects from warm areas are presented. These
   could be of interest if I: natans spreads into warmer areas of North
   America.}},

Abstract = {{order to ensure that the intake of iodine from iodized salt is adequate,
   the effects of cooking, storage and iodination on iodine content in
   iodized salt have been studied. For monitoring the analytical
   performance, a quality control examination was also undertaken. The loss
   of iodine was greater when salt was stored in plastic bag than in glass
   bottle. The loss was greater in fortified salt stored at 37 degrees C:
   and under 76\% humidity than in that at 20 similar to 25 degrees C: and
   under lower humidity. The retention of iodine varied with the kind of
   foods and also was influenced by the water content of cooked food. In
   general, the retention of iodine during cooking varied considerably
   (from 36.6\% to 86.1\%). The iodine concentration in salts varied
   greater from 3.0 to 100.3 mg/kg in salt for markets, and from 0 to 90.0
   mg/kg in salts for households. 48.3\% of samples from markets were found
   to be in compliance with national standards (30 similar to 50 mg/kg),
   and 72.0\% of samples from households were in compliance with national
   standard (20 similar to 50 mg/kg). Analytical data collected from 8 of
   the cooperative laboratories for an analytical reference material showed
   a 95\% confidence interval of the population mean for both precision and
   accuracy, falling within X +/- 2SD and passing quality control
   examination.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes the results of an ongoing survey (1975-96) of
   wintering birds in twelve 10 km x 10 km squares around Banbury,
   Oxfordshire. Trends in both abundance and distribution were discernible
   for 48 species of the 93 recorded. These trends mirror those published
   for breeding birds in the UK as a whole. The severe decline of many
   farmland species that has been documented elsewhere is clearly shown
   here, although recently several species in our study are showing
   encouraging increases or stability. This study, carried our by the
   Banbury Ornithological Society, is the only long-term scheme monitoring
   terrestrial wintering birds in the UK. Ils results are particularly
   important because, in winter, the UK may support a significant
   proportion of the European population of some species, and if
   demonstrates the validity of winter census.}},

Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{104-111}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Male Hoopoes Upupa epops, (Coraciformes) have a very simple song, with a
   repertoire size of one. The number of elements per strophe (strophe
   length) is the only difference between strophes of the same male, and
   the main difference between males. The function of this song was
   analysed in a colour-ringed population of Hoopoes in Granada, southern
   Spain, by monitoring the pattern of male song activity and response to
   an experimental song throughout the breeding season. Both spontaneous
   songs and responses to playback experiments decreased after the onset of
   egg-laying, and song production was not associated with feeding sites or
   nest holes. Moreover, some of the breeding males that had lost their
   females resumed singing, Males also used song to recover lost contacts
   with their mates. These findings suggest that the principal function of
   song in the Hoopoe is intersexual, for attracting females, and that, in
   an intrasexual context, its use is restricted to defence of mates. The
   dual function of Hoopoe song suggests that it provides information both
   for males and females, probably about male quality.}},

Abstract = {{Although most vascular plants have symbiotic relationships with soil
   microbes, and there is an extensive theoretical literature on the
   evolution of mutualism, there has been little experimental examination
   of the evolution of mutualism between plants and their microbial
   symbionts. We inoculated red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) seedlings from
   three high- and three low-elevation populations with crushed nodule
   suspensions containing the nitrogen fixing bacterium Frankia from either
   the parent trees (familiar strains) or the other plant population
   sampled within the parent watershed (unfamiliar strains). The inoculated
   seedlings were planted on three high- and three low-elevation sites.
   Growth was monitored over the second and third year following planting,
   after which the whole plants were harvested. The proportion of nitrogen
   derived from fixation was estimated from the ratio of stable nitrogen
   isotopes in the harvested leaves. On low-elevation sites, which had high
   soil nitrogen, plants with familiar Frankia strains were half the size
   and derived less fixed nitrogen from their symbionts compared with
   plants inoculated with unfamiliar Frankia strains. On high-elevation
   sites, which had low soil nitrogen, the type of inoculum had little
   effect on plant performance, although plants with familiar inoculum were
   consistently larger than plants with, unfamiliar inoculum. These results
   suggest that the degree of mutualism in this symbiosis depends on
   environmental conditions and may decrease with time.}},

   and acoustic emission (AE) counts on adjacent wood. Bait stations were
   added as needed. Six to fourteen aboveground bait stations u ere
   installed in each structure at 3 or 6 placement sites, Termites fed in a
   mean of 73.3\% of the stations installed to consume a total of 42-149 g
   of bait matrix. FST at the home had ground contact and consumed 2- 3.5
   times more bait matrix than aerial infestations of FST at the
   condominiums. Acoustic emission counts generally declined from
   pretreatment levels at all monitoring locations following installation
   of the bait stations, with the exception of one condominium where AE
   counts peaked 6 weeks following installation. At all sites, bait matrix
   consumption in stations peaked during the first two months following
   installation of the aboveground bait stations. Baiting eliminated
   detectable FST activity in all structures, as indicated by lack of
   visual signs of termites and AED activity for at least two months.
   Elimination of detectable activity followed two or more months of bait
   matrix consumption by termites. Mean time to elimination of detectable
   activity for FST populations was 3.3 months (range 2-4 months).}},

Title = {{Integrating indicators, endpoints and value systems in strategic
   management of the rivers of the Kruger National Park}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{439-451}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. In trying to operationalize the notion of sustainable ecosystem
   health, ecologists have focused on identifying sets of indicators which
   can be used to assess river condition relative to some normative,
   undegraded condition. Recognition and description of this normative
   state has proved elusive, particularly in highly variable semiarid
   ecosystems. Without an operational definition of the desired system
   condition that reflects both scientific rigour and broader societal
   value systems, rivers are unlikely to be managed effectively.
   2. Managing river health should not be confused with measuring it. Many
   monitoring or assessment programs become ends in themselves instead of
   being the means to achieving specific management goals. The absence of a
   test of the results of monitoring further introduces the risk of
   management by observation and `pseudo-fact'. Health `endpoints' provide
   a scientific description of management goals, while `values' provide a
   societal perspective. Together they complement the use of indicators and
   provide the basis for a strategic rather than reactive approach to
   management.
   3. The integration of value systems, endpoints and indicators of
   ecosystem health or ecosystem integrity forms the cornerstone of a
   consultative management process for the rivers of the Kruger National
   Park.
   4. An objectives hierarchy has been developed to service management's
   institutional hierarchy. `Vision' and objectives serve upper levels of
   management with value based statements of strategic intent which have
   been tested against public opinion. Goals provide managers on the ground
   with specific ecological endpoints termed `thresholds of probable
   concern' (TPCs). TPCs are described by a range of spatially and
   temporally bounded indicators of the system's response to the main
   potential agents of change.
   5. TPCs represent statements or hypotheses of the limits of acceptable
   change in ecosystem structure, function and composition. They thereby
   provide an inductive and strategic approach to adaptive management in a
   data poor situation. Integrated monitoring, research and modelling track
   criteria relative to TPCs and question whether management action, or
   recalibration of the TPC, is needed. TPCs thus provide direction for
   management but their validity and appropriateness are frequently
   challenged and adaptively modified.
   6. The objectives hierarchy gives Kruger Park management a mandate to
   `maintain biodiversity in all its natural facets and fluxes'.
   Alluviation, as a consequence of increased sediment supply and decreased
   sediment transport capacity, is a major threat to the biodiversity of
   the bedrock-controlled rivers which flow through the park. Thus, for
   example, TPCs for geomorphic diversity reflect permissible ranges of
   change in bedrock character of the physical template. They are measured
   as change in the proportion of different geomorphic units in identified
   representative reaches. TPCs for riparian vegetation are measured as
   change in population structure of selected species within the
   representative reaches. They reflect a likely range of biotic responses
   to change in the physical template. A specific set of indicators,
   reflecting response to the major agents of change, therefore provides a
   parsimonious program for assessing ecosystem condition relative to
   explicit goals and a clearly defined management process.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical concentration profiles of airborne particulate matter were
   measured in four different indoor environments - library, coffee room,
   workshop and undergraduate student hostel - on the University Campus at
   Sutton Bonington. Measurements were carried out using an
   electronically-controlled lifting platform carrying a real-time optical
   particle monitor for sampling air sequentially at different heights
   within the breathing zone. Data was automatically logged at the
   different receptor levels, for the determination of the average Vertical
   concentration profile of the various particle size ranges which include
   inhalable, thoracic, alveolic, PM10 and PM2.5. Vertical concentration
   profiles measured in these different indoor environments exhibited
   different characteristics but in almost all cases it was clear that
   different height groups of the population are exposed to different
   concentrations of the pollutant. This has implications on setting of air
   quality standards for the protection of public health. The results
   indicate that we may have to re-think the whole concept of air quality
   standards and develop protocols for indoor air quality monitoring and
   modelling which would take into account the above-mentioned factor.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial pattern of the Rio Cuarto Corn Disease vector, Delphacodes
   kuscheli (Hom., Delphacidae), was analysed in oat fields within the
   endemic area of the disease, during the growing seasons 1993 and 1994.
   The spatial pattern was analysed by fitting the probabilistic models
   Poisson and negative binomial and estimation of single-date and overall
   aggregation indices. The population of the different stage classes, sex:
   and wing forms showed a significant trend to aggregation as the negative
   binomial model fitted the observed frequency distributions in more than
   78\% of the cases (sampling dates) while the Poisson model fitted well
   in only 28\% of cases or less. Single-date aggregation index, C-A,
   ranged from 0.3 to 0.84. Overall (whole season) aggregation index,
   C-A{*}, estimated through the Bliss and Owen's regression method, ranged
   from 0.18 (female adults) to 1.08 (nymphs I-II), indicating a moderate
   degree of aggregation compared with other planthopper species. There
   were no significant relationships between aggregation and population
   density. The minimum number of sampling units and critical lines for
   sequential sampling plans were calculated based on the estimation of
   C-A{*} for the precision levels (D) 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3. Even low degrees
   of aggregation, like that of adults, demand much more sampling effort
   than randomly distributed populations, particularly at high densities.
   General implications and limitations of the proposed sampling plans for
   monitoring the vector population abundance are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of five (5 000, 10 000, 15 000, 20 000, 24 000 kg ha(-1)
   year(-1)) different doses of organic fertilizer (cow dung) were studied
   on pond productivity in terms of plankton production and fish biomass in
   freshwater fish ponds. The grow out period was 60 days. Physico-chemical
   factors of pond waters were also monitored. With an increase in the
   fertilizer dose, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (1.7 +/- 0.1 - 10.35
   +/- 0.05 mg L-1), O-PO4 (0.04 +/- 0.0 - 0.77 +/- 0.02 mg L-1) and NH4-N
   (0.03 +/- 0.02 - 0.32 +/- 0.02 mg L-1) increased significantly (P <
   0.05). Alkalinity (79.0 +/- 1.6 - 164.0 +/- 3.8 mg L-1) also increased
   with the increase in fertilizer dose, declining after 60 and 75 days
   (48.8 +/- 1.13 - 67.9 +/- 2.1 mg L-1). NO3-N was maximum (1.66 +/- 0.2
   mg L-1) in the ponds which received cow dung at 15 000 kg ha(-1)
   year(-1), and declined (0.93 +/- 0.5 mg L-1) at higher doses. Dissolved
   oxygen (DO) remained significantly high (4.7 mg L-1) up to the third (15
   000 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) treatment. Highest plankton population
   (phytoplankton 17350.0 +/- 1250.0 no L-1), zooplankton (373.0 +/- 22.0
   no L-1), species diversity (phytoplankton 3.0, zooplankton 2.3), fish
   biomass (4.45 kg) and specific growth rate (SGR) (2.36 \% body weight
   (BW) d(-1)) were also observed in ponds which were treated with
   fertilizer at 15000 kg ha(-1) year(-1). However, at higher doses, a
   decline in these parameters (phytoplankton, 0.0 - 8810.0 +/- 690.0 no
   L-1; zooplankton, 0.0 - 205.0 +/- 25.0 no L-1; fish biomass, 2.3 kg;
   SGR, 1.25 \% body weight (BW) d(-1)) was observed. Furthermore, with a
   decrease in the water temperature from 24 degrees C (on day 60) to 21
   degrees C (on day 75), a decline in nutrient release, plankton
   population L-1 and species diversity was observed. Sediment analysis
   indicated that with an increase in the fertilizer dosage, a significant
   and progressive increase in the accumulation of organic carbon (0.787
   +/- 0.006 - 0.935 +/- 0.01), total nitrogen (0.877 +/- 0.071 - 1.231 +/-
   0.03), NH4-N (554.3 +/- 0.57 - 68.95 +/- 0.81), NO3-N (78.5 +/- 1.21 -
   98.5 +/- 0.35), total P (140.0 +/- 0.50 - 151.0 +/- 1.27) and soluble P
   (7.15 +/- 0.18 - 10.1 +/- 0.56) took place; similarly, electrical
   conductivity (EC) values of sediment also increased progressively (from
   200.0 +/- 7.1-300.0 +/- 10.63 mu mhos cm(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{We used high-frequency surveillance radar as a non-intrusive method to
   census nocturnal burrow-nesting Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus
   aleuticus) on the world's largest colony, Triangle Island, British
   Columbia. In the largest subcolony, West Bay, the radar unit was
   operated 2200-0510 h nightly from 30 Apr.-11 May 1996 during the onset
   of hatching. Radar images were stored on video cassette for subsequent
   image analysis. We report total nightly activity based upon cumulative
   samples from the tapes at 30-s intervals to determine the percent of
   bird activity within a fixed area. Estimates of the average image size
   of an individual bird were used to develop conservative counts of birds
   in the sample area. Activity at the colony began approximately 1.5 h
   after sunset and ended at least 15 min before sunrise. Activity levels
   increased over the study period and showed considerably nightly
   variation. Nightly activity was continuous at low levels through the
   sampling period from 30 Apr. to 3 May. Late evening peaks of activity
   around 2300 h were evident and tended to increase in intensity from 3
   May onward. Nightly activity at the colony was correlated with the
   number of chicks hatched the following day. The maximum estimate of
   individual birds detected was 156,327 on 10 May. Radar has great
   potential to elucidate patterns of seasonal activity We contrast and
   evaluate the use of radar and traditional methods based on burrow counts
   and identify several major advantages for radar in long-term population
   monitoring and seabird research programs.}},

Abstract = {{Nest reuse, here defined as within-year laying of a second clutch in an
   unmodified nest by the same female, is rare to unknown for most
   non-colonial, open-nesting passerines and has not been reported for
   Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii). Therefore, we report two
   instances of nest reuse, both by the same female, in a small population
   of banded Willow Flycatchers in Arizona. One of 12 nests was reused in
   1996 and one of 18 nests in 1997. Because of the possibility of reuse,
   investigators monitoring Willow Flycatcher nests should consider
   re-examining previously used nests if a new nest can not be found for a
   female which continues to exhibit nesting behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of translocation on timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus)
   was assessed experimentally by moving 11 specimens distances of between
   8 km and 172 km away from their native populations and releasing them
   into a study area having a resident rattlesnake population. All
   translocated snakes were equipped with radio transmitters, and their
   behavior, survival, and interaction with resident snakes were observed.
   Eighteen resident snakes were also telemetrically monitored during the
   four-year study. Six of the 11 (54.5\%) translocated snakes are known to
   have died while only 2 of the 18 (11.1\%) resident snakes experienced
   mortality during the period they were radiotracked. Of the six
   translocated specimens that died, three experienced overwinter mortality
   despite their location of resident hibernacula, two were killed by
   predators, and one died from disease. The mean daily survival rate of
   translocated snakes (0.9973) was significantly lower than that of
   resident snakes (0.9993). Translocated snakes selected habitats similar
   to that of residents, foraged successfully, and maintained body mass.
   However, translocated snakes exhibited atypical movement patterns
   consisting of extensive and long-distance traveling. The six
   translocated male rattlesnakes averaged 15,017 m (SE = 2184.3) in total
   distance traveled from release until hibernation with daily movements of
   123.8 m (SE = 19.40) and convex polygon activity range areas of 600.6 ha
   (SE = 253.0). Comparatively, the total active season distance traveled
   by the seven resident male rattlesnakes averaged only 5575 m (SE =
   936.5) with mean daily movements of 36.9 m (SE = 5.36) and convex
   polygon activity ranges of 59.9 ha (SE = 13.04). Mean activity
   parameters 3 to 5 times larger than those of resident snakes were also
   typical for translocated female rattlesnakes. Translocated snakes
   located active hibernacula apparently by following resident snakes;
   however, their overwintering mortality was higher than that of
   residents. Translocated snakes that successfully survived the first
   overwinter period continued to exhibit more extensive movements in their
   second active season than did residents. However, there was evidence of
   the establishment of a more resident-like pattern of movement among
   these specimens during the second year. Translocation of adult snakes is
   not recommended as a standard conservation practice because of its
   immediate and long-term negative impacts.}},

Abstract = {{The use of light traps in sampling moth populations is an established
   technique used by entomologists and ecologists. However, trap data
   partly reflect the variable attractiveness of UV light to different
   species of moth. There are also potential problems of the practicality
   and expense of running traps in certain locations.
   An alternative method of recording moth populations is developed, using
   a modification of the transect count technique used for butterflies
   (Pollard and Yates, 1993) and recently applied to moths (Spalding,
   1997). During transects, moths were observed by torch-light in a 5 by 5
   m box, before the recorder walked on for 10 paces, and recorded moths in
   the next 5 m box. The transect approach was tested in the field,
   alongside traditional light trap and sugar methods.
   Transects recorded moth species for relatively little effort, produced
   repeatable measures of relative density, and provided habitat-specific
   data. This approach is likely to provide a valuable addition to light
   trapping in biodiversity inventories, species surveys, and in monitoring
   the effects of habitat management for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Data from the Greater Manchester Butterfly Atlas (UK) reveal a highly
   significant and substantial impact of visits on both species' richness
   and species' incidence in squares. This effect has been demonstrated for
   three different zones mapped at different scales. The significant impact
   of number of visits persists when data are amalgamated for coarser
   scales. The findings demonstrate that it is essential for distribution
   mapping projects to record data on recording effort as well as on the
   target organisms. Suggestions are made as to how distribution mapping
   may be improved, including a geographically and environmentally
   representative structure of permanently monitored squares and closer
   links between distribution mapping and the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme
   (BMS), which primarily monitors changes in butterfly populations. The
   benefit to conservation will be data that can be better used to analyse
   the reasons for changes in ranges and distributions, fundamental for
   determining priorities and policy decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Population densities of nematodes in held soil without plants were
   monitored for 10 months following application of organic amendments to
   pots in a greenhouse. The four treatments consisted of three different
   kinds of organic amendments: homogeneous crop residues of maize (Zea
   mays, C:N = 48.0:1), Texas panicum (Panicum texanum, C:N = 32.9:1), or
   velvetbean (Mucuna pruriens, C:N = 18.6:1), plus a control without any
   amendment. Plant-parasitic nematodes declined in all treatments due to
   absence of a food source. Bacterivore numbers increased following
   amendment application and remained greater than initial population
   levels until 4 months after application. Fungivore numbers were higher
   than initial levels until 6 months after amendment application and did
   not decline below the initial numbers during the course of the
   experiment. On several sampling dates, the bacterivorous genera
   Cervidellus and Eucephalobus were most abundant in pots with maize
   residues. Among the fungivores, Aphelenchoides numbers early in the
   experiment were greatest in pots amended with velvetbean, whereas
   numbers of Aphelenchus, Nothotylenchus, and Tylenchidae (mainly
   Filenchus) were greatest during the latter half of the experiment
   following the maize amendment. Omnivorous nematodes, particularly
   Eudorylaimus, showed two peaks in abundance during the course of the
   experiment. Results provided some evidence that population levels of
   some genera of bacterivores and fungivores may be affected by specific
   organic amendments.}},

Abstract = {{Field samples of Anopheles gambiae s.s. from Cote d'Ivoire were tested
   with 5 pyrethroids (cyfluthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, alpha-cypermethrin,
   deltamethrin, permethrin), 1 pseudo-pyrethroid (etofenprox), and an
   organochlorine (DDT). With the use of World Health Organization
   diagnostic tests, 5 out of 6 samples were found cross-resistant to these
   insecticides. A strong decrease in knockdown effect and mortality was
   also observed when testing deltamethrin-impregnated nettings. With a
   polymerase chain reaction amplification of spe cific alleles diagnostic
   test, resistance was found associated with the presence of a kdr
   mutation. The strong correlation between kd, allelic frequency and
   resistance to DDT or etofenprox indicated that kdr was the main
   resistance factor for these 2 insecticides. On the contrary, a lower
   correlation was observed between kdr frequency and resistance to 4 of
   the 5 pyrethroids tested, suggesting that another mechanism was also
   involved, likely a metabolic detoxification. These results point out the
   necessity to monitor pyrethroid resistance and the presence of kdr
   before implementation of any impregnated bed-net programs for malaria
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Examination of phenological patterns of tropical trees at different
   temporal and spatial scales can elucidate biotic and abiotic factors
   that correlate with fruiting, flowering and/or leaf set patterns. In
   this study, 3793 trees from 104 species in Kibale National Park, Uganda
   were monitored. The trees were selected from two sites (Kanyawara and
   Ngogo) separated by 10 km. Trees were monitored monthly to document
   community-wide and population-level fruiting and flowering patterns for
   a maximum of 76 mo. Analysis of two sites over a number of years
   permitted examination of generalities of patterns found on smaller
   spatial and temporal scales. Spectral analysis indicated that
   community-level flowering and fruiting at Kanyawara exhibited regular
   annual peaks, although the flowering peaks were of shorter duration. At
   Ngogo, community-level flowering also displayed regular annual peaks,
   but fruiting had an irregular pattern with no distinct peaks. The
   abundance of fruiting trees at Kanyawara was negatively related to the
   minimum temperature in the previous season (3-7 mo prior). Since
   fruiting tended to peak when the first wet season of the year was ending
   and the dry season was beginning, this suggests that the minimum
   temperature in the previous dry season is important in determining how
   many individuals fruit. Flowering at Kanyawara peaked immediately after
   the maximum annual period of high irradiance. Within-species
   synchronization was evident in the flowering for all species examined at
   Ngogo and for 64\% of those at Kanyawara. Fruiting was synchronous
   within species for 64\% of the species at both sites. Despite this
   general community-level synchronization, the months of peak fruiting and
   flowering for some species varied markedly among years. Furthermore, for
   a number of species the timing of fruiting or flowering events differed
   between Kanyawara and Ngogo. For some species, trends that were
   suggested from one year of data were not supported when additional years
   were considered. Although these two sites are close together, share many
   of the same species, and experience similar climatic regimes, many
   phenological patterns were site-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the results of a 4-year study examining the use of
   nest boxes by Red Squirrels. Two different designs of nest box were
   erected in a conifer woodland which supported a high density of animals;
   spring population estimates were between 3.5 and 4.0 individuals per
   hectare. Boxes were used by adults, subadults, lactating females and
   their young. Breeding females more frequently used the larger of the two
   box designs, although this preference was not statistically significant.
   There was no difference in the mean sizes of litters found within the
   two box types. The mean size of litters present in boxes was 2.7 (n =
   31, SE = 0.23) which was similar to the mean litter size of 2.5 (n = 8,
   SE = 0.50) found in dreys. Thus, nest boxes proved to be a valuable
   research tool for monitoring parturition dates, litter sizes, nestling
   sex ratios, and preweaning mortality.}},

Title = {{Contemporary patterns of mercury contamination in the Portuguese

Abstract = {{Mercury concentrations in 1809 egg and plumage samples of adults and
   chicks of seabirds from colonies in the Portuguese Atlantic (30-40
   degrees N, 8-32 degrees W) were determined. Species and tissues were
   selected to ensure varied levels of ecological (epipelagic vs
   mesopelagic), spatial (coastal vs pelagic) and temporal (short-to
   medium-term) integration of mercury contamination. There was an overall
   general agreement in the information provided by species and types of
   tissues employed. Results show a four-fold increase in mercury
   bioaccumulation from the epipelagic to the mesopelagic compartment.
   Fourteen out of 20 inter-location comparisons of mercury concentrations
   in tissues yield statistically significant differences. However, 11
   differences did not rise above the intra-specific variability of the
   monitor species and were not considered to reflect genuine geographic
   variation in mercury contamination. The remaining three differences
   indicate slightly enhanced mercury contamination in the epipelagic food
   web adjacent to the southwest Portuguese coast, which deserves further
   elucidation. Seabird indications of mercury contamination in the study
   region were assembled with similar information in a brief meta-analysis
   for the North Atlantic and adjoining regions. An overall comparison
   indicates that contamination levels in the Portuguese Atlantic are in
   agreement with levels reported for populations of the same species in
   `non-polluted' areas elsewhere. Such mesoscale background uniformity of
   mercury contamination in the North Atlantic conveys further evidence of
   global pollution by mercury due to atmospheric deposition at long
   distance from emission sources. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic environmental stress is a likely contributor to outbreaks
   of disease due to immunosuppression or increased host vulnerability.
   Estuarine organisms are exposed to variable concentrations of marine
   antifouling agents, such as tributyltin (TBT), with higher exposures
   existing near ports and marinas. Eastern oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica), inhabiting the northern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
   coast of North America, are susceptible to a protozoan pathogen,
   Perkinsus marinus, which has devastated oyster populations and depleted
   oyster fisheries throughout its range. This study examined the effects
   of exposure to environmental levels of TBT on susceptibility and
   survival of oysters when subsequently challenged with P. marinus.
   Oysters were exposed to TBT (0, 30 and 80 ng/L) in Bow-through aquaria
   for 9 weeks, then moved to static aquaria, where they were challenged
   with parasites and monitored for an additional 8 weeks for mortality and
   disease. Results indicated increased infection intensity and oyster
   mortality in the TBT-exposed treatments relative to unexposed controls.
   It is hypothesized that TBT exacerbates the infectious disease process
   and that exposed oysters succumb at lower levels of infection. Published

Abstract = {{The insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen (a juvenoid) effectively
   inhibits the hatching of eggs of the tobacco or cotton whitefly, Bemisia
   tabaci, as well as causing pupal mortality. Since 1991, this insecticide
   has been one of the main agents for controlling B tabaci on Israeli
   cotton. Seasonal trends of susceptibility to pyriproxyfen in field
   populations were monitored from June (prior to treatment) through late
   summer at different locations in Israel. After seven years of
   pyriproxyfen use within an insecticide resistance management strategy
   that limits this insecticide to a single application per season,
   susceptibility has been maintained in many areas. In other locations
   where pyriproxyfen had been used against geographically isolated
   populations of B tabaci, moderate to high levels of resistance have been
   observed. Ecological and agronomic factors that may contribute to
   geographical variation in selection for resistance are discussed.
   The dynamics of pyriproxyfen-susceptible and -resistant populations of B
   tabaci following a single application of pyriproxyfen were investigated
   under simulated field conditions in the laboratory. The susceptible
   population was suppressed very effectively, whereas effects of
   pyriproxyfen against the resistant population were much more transient.
   Differences in the productivity of susceptible and resistant strains in
   the absence of pyriproxyfen treatment could reflect a fitness cost
   accounting for observed reductions in resistance levels between seasons
   in the held. They may also explain why, following a recent reduction in
   the use of pyriproxyfen in cotton fields, resistance in 1998 declined to
   levels observed in 1995/6. (C) 1999 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral heterogeneity in terms of co-existing domains with a distinct
   molecular organization is an area of increasing interest in membrane
   biology, The structural and dynamic aspects of the in-plane domain
   organization of lipids are becoming well documented, especially for
   model membrane systems. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L, cv, Desiree) callus
   cells and roots of plantlets from stem node culture were doped with a
   spin-labeled analog of the methyl ester of palmitic acid bearing the
   paramagnetic nitroxide group at position C-5 of the acyl chain, which
   serves as a monitor of membrane fluidity of the region close to the
   polar phospholipid head groups of the bilayer, Model reconstruction of
   the line-shapes of the expert mental spectra revealed the co-existence
   of two types of membrane domains with different ordering and dynamics of
   lipids in the membranes of both callus and root cells, With changes in
   temperature, relatively small differences were detected in either type
   of domain in the lipid ordering of the bilayer as characterized by order
   parameter S, However, the relative population of domains in the bilayer
   exhibited stronger temperature dependence, Typically, the relative
   proportion of disordered domains with less molecular order (smaller S)
   was larger in the membranes of callus cells compared to those of root
   cells, indicating higher fluidity throughout the measured temperature
   range (5-35 degrees C). The Arrhenius activation energies for
   rearrangement of lipid molecules within the bilayer were found to be
   higher for root tissue membranes, indicating the ability of root cells
   to oppose actively any drastic changes of membrane structuring under
   temperature stress. The distinctions in organization of lateral domains
   between the callus and root cell membranes may be correlated with
   differences in growth rate and metabolic activity between these two
   types of tissue.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacies of the new strobilurin fungicide kresoxim-methyl for the
   protection of apple leaves from infection by baseline populations of
   Venturia inaequalis were uniform across five major apple growing regions
   in North America. The mean ED50 value determined for 25 populations was
   0.35 mu g ml(-1), with values ranging from 0.11 mu g ml(-1) to 0.75 mu g
   ml(-1). The mean level of scab control achieved at the kresoxim-methyl
   dose of 4 mu g ml(-1) was 93\%. For one of the five orchards sampled in
   each region, kresoxim-methyl sensitivities of germinating conidia were
   determined. Sensitivities of 250 isolates were broadly distributed, with
   ED50 values ranging from 0.003 mu g ml(-1) to 0.14 mu g ml(-1) and a
   mean of 0.02 mu g ml(-1). This broad range of in vitro sensitivities was
   not reflected for the in vivo efficacy of kresoxim-methyl in the
   protection of apple leaves from scab infections. The discrepancy between
   in vivo and in vitro sensitivities implies that in vivo tests are more
   useful for the monitoring of kresoxim-methyl sensitivities of orchard
   populations. Because it can be expected that only isolates resistant
   under both test conditions will be prone to future selection, such
   isolates will contribute to increased frequencies of the least sensitive
   isolates described in this baseline study. Testing of in vitro isolate
   sensitivities will, therefore, provide an additional tool in the

Abstract = {{We tested whether lead exposure, as evidenced by liver lead
   concentration, affected body composition and organ sizes of canvasback
   ducks Aythya valisineria in Louisiana during winter 1987-88. After
   adjusting for body size, sex, age, and site and month of collection, we
   found decreases in ingesta-free body mass; breast, leg, and body
   protein; body fat; intestine length; and liver and gizzard masses
   associated with increased liver lead concentrations. There were no
   apparent associations between liver lead concentrations and testes and
   body ash masses, or caecal length. We used the concentration of 26.7 ppm
   of liver lead on a dry matter (dm) basis as indicative of lead
   toxicosis. We predicted that a canvasback with 26.7 ppm dm liver lead
   would weigh 209 g less and have 105 g less fat than an unexposed
   individual. Whereas many lead exposed canvasbacks may survive through
   winter, their subsequent survival, ability to reproduce and perform
   other annual cycle events may be compromised. We recommend management to
   make lead unavailable to waterfowl at major concentration areas and
   periodic monitoring of lead contamination in waterfowl populations.}},

Abstract = {{The haulout pattern of seals, i.e. the distribution of the time they
   spend on shore or on ice, may be influenced by a large number of
   extrinsic factors such as season, time of day and weather, as well as
   factors related to the animal's internal state. In this study we used a
   time-lapse video system at a haulout site, and satellite relay data
   loggers attached to 11 individual seals to monitor haulout pattern of
   grey seals Halichoerus grypus in the Baltic Sea during summer and early
   winter from 1989 through 1996. Time of day had the greatest influence on
   haulout patterns with the maximum numbers of seals ashore at night.
   Season and habitat specific characteristics also had important effects
   on haulout pattern. We suggest that diel changes in prey behaviour and
   distribution account for the nocturnal haulout pattern observed. The
   size of the population of grey seals in the Baltic Sea has been
   estimated by the number of seals ashore. Our results demonstrate the
   possibility of improving future estimates using a correction based on
   time of day.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the less numerous trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator)
   harvested in tundra swan (C. columbianus) hunts is a management concern.
   As trumpeter swan ranges expand, their populations become more sympatric
   with tundra swans during fall and winter, but the 2 species are
   difficult to separate in the field. Eight states currently allow limited
   permit hunting for tundra swans. The hunting of trumpeter swans is
   currently limited by experimental quota to 3 states in the Pacific
   Flyway. We compared bill measurements (tip to posterior edge of nares
   opening) for trumpeter swans captured in Idaho (n = 672) with
   measurements of tundra swans harvested in Utah (n = 1,414) and with
   measurements reported on postcards (n = 890) returned by hunters who
   harvested swans in Montana. Mean bill measurements for adult and cygnet
   trumpeter swans were 68.8 mm and 67.6 mm, respectively, and for tundra
   swans, 54.0 mm and 52.4 mm, respectively; differences were significant
   (P < 0.001) between species and in each age class. Over 99\% of
   trumpeter swan adults and cygnets measured greater than or equal to 62
   mm and greater than or equal to 61 mm, respectively, whereas 99\% of
   tundra swan adults and cygnets were less than or equal to 60 mm and less
   than or equal to 59 mm, respectively. Over 96\% of adult tundra swans
   also were identifiable by yellow lore spots, which were rare (0.3\%) in
   adult trumpeter swans. Utah data showed that 10 (0.7\%) of 1,424 swans
   checked during the 1994-96 seasons were trumpeter swans. A Montana
   postcard survey was mailed to swan hunters during 1992-96 requesting
   bill measurements, presence or absence of a yellow lore spot, and
   plumage color to assess age. Of 890 swans reported, 19 (2.1\%) were
   judged to be trumpeter swans. The postcard survey identifies species
   with minimal error, is a useful and inexpensive technique to monitor
   minimum trumpeter swan harvest in tundra swan hunts, provides age
   composition of the harvest, and could be used in tundra swan hunting
   states. The utility of the technique is dependent on accurate
   measurements and a high compliance rate by hunters.}},

Abstract = {{Fishers (Martes pennanti) are important forest carnivores and furbearers
   that are susceptible to overharvest. Traditional indices used to monitor
   fisher populations typically overestimate litter size and proportion of
   females that give birth. We evaluated the usefulness of 2 indices of
   reproduction to determine proportion of female fishers that gave birth
   in a particular year. We used female fishers of known age and
   reproductive histories to compare appearance of placental scars with
   incidence of pregnancy and litter size. Microscopic observation of
   freshly removed reproductive tracts correctly identified pregnant
   fishers and correctly estimated litter size in 3 of 4 instances, but
   gross observation of placental scars failed to correctly identify
   pregnant fishers and litter size. Microscopic observations of
   reproductive tracts in carcasses that were not fresh also failed to
   identify pregnant animals and litter size. We evaluated mean sizes of
   anterior nipples to see if different reproductive classes could be
   distinguished. Mean anterior nipple size of captive and wild fishers
   correctly identified current-year breeders from nonbreeders. Former
   breeders were misclassified in 4 of 13 instances. Presence of placental
   scars accurately predicted parturition in a small sample size of
   fishers, but absence of placental scars did not signify that a female
   did not give birth. In addition to enabling the estimation of
   parturition rates in live animals more accurately than traditional
   indices, mean anterior nipple size also provided an estimate of the
   percentage of adult females that successfully raised young. Though using
   mean anterior nipple size to index reproductive success looks promising,
   additional data are needed to evaluate effects of using dried, stretched
   pelts on nipple size for management purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for release of ammonium (NH4+) and/or urea from the pool
   of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was examined in samples taken from
   Lake Kinneret (Israel), the River Charente estuary and coastal water
   near lie de Ri! (French Atlantic coast). After prefiltration through 1.0
   or 1.2 mu m membranes to remove most of the microbiota with the
   exception of bacteria, water samples with or without supplements (40 mu
   M) of various organic nitrogen compounds (arginine, glucosamine,
   guanine, hypoxanthine, lysine, ornithine or thymine) were incubated at
   in situ temperatures, in the dark, for 7 to 14 d. Concentrations of NH4+
   and urea were monitored during the incubation period. Increases of NH4+
   with time were observed in 8 out of 12 experiments with unsupplemented
   lake samples, and in a single trial with coastal water, but not with
   Charente estuary water. In some experiments, increases of urea
   concentrations were also observed. The addition of organic nitrogen
   compounds almost always led to NH4+ increases in samples from all
   locations; guanine, hypoxanthine, arginine and, in the case of Charente
   water, glucosamine gave rise to urea. The addition of nitrification
   inhibitors (40 PM) at the start of some experiments gave inconsistent
   results, but in some cases appeared to increase the concentrations of
   NH4+ with time. Taken together, the results of these experiments clearly
   indicate the potential in natural waters for degradation of DON pool
   constituents by indigenous bacteria and/or free dissolved enzymes to
   NH4+ or urea; these in turn can be effectively exploited by the ambient
   microbiota. The breakdown of DON with the concomitant release of readily
   available compounds such as NH4+ or urea could be an important process
   in the nitrogen nutrition of phytoplankton and bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the comparative growth and mortality of two crosses
   involving S85 and S89, two Ostrea edulis strains selected by IFREMER for
   their resistance to Bonamia ostreae. A first year of monitoring had
   revealed that the two crosses grew significantly better than two control
   populations from Quiberon Bay (Brittany) and Palavas (Mediterranean
   Sea). In a second and final year experiment which lasted from April to
   November 1995, the cross between the first generation of S89 and wild
   oysters (G0G1) performed better for most growth characteristics (whole
   weight, shell weight, length and width), than both the cross between the
   first generation of S89 and the second generation of S85 (G1G2) and the
   Quiberon control group, which were not significantly different from each
   other. Mortality was quite high during the experiment but was lower for
   the G0G1 cross (61\%) than for both G1G2, (67\%) and the Quiberon
   controls (76\%). A low level of B. ostreae infection was detected during
   the experiments indicating early infections. These results are
   consistent with the previous one showing a direct or indirect effect of
   selection to B. ostreae resistance on growth. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The major nesting areas for loggerhead turtles in Brazil are estimated
   to produce about 90\% female hatchlings on account of their warm
   temperatures. In the present study, sand temperatures were monitored at
   the southern cooler end of the nesting range (Comboios, Espirito Santo):
   the temperatures were cool enough to produce a far greater proportion of
   males than at the major beaches further north. Particular beaches may be
   thermally suited for the production of a particular sex. Protection of
   rookeries that appear minor in terms of numbers of turtles nesting could
   be important for the health of a larger population by insuring that
   there is an appropriate sex ratio. Temperatures were also monitored in a
   central guarded hatchery, set back from high seas. The hatchery was
   thermally similar to zones on the beach where turtles commonly lay,

Abstract = {{The seasonal dynamics of two eelgrass species, Zostera marina L. and Z
   noltii Hornem., were examined for 2 years in a Mediterranean lagoon
   (Thau, south France), within mixed stand in two contrasting sites. A
   number of environmental parameters (water temperature, light, nutrients
   in water and in sediment) were also monitored during the study period.
   The similarity in seasonal conditions and the mixed nature of stands
   allowed to tackle species specific effect and those imposed by habitat
   characteristics on seasonal dynamics of these two species. The
   examination of ecological conditions at the two sites showed that the
   pattern of dominance arose from differences in physical climate and
   nutrient regime: Z noltii prevailed at the south site (SS) which
   experienced frequent wind generated waves and currents, and Z marina at
   the north site (NS) which was more sheltered and permanently supplied
   with nutrients (reared shellfishes and watershed). Despite apparent
   species-specific responses to seasonal forcing (biomass of Z marina
   being controlled by solely temperature while that of Z noltii varied
   with both temperature and light) and species-specific branching
   potential (Inax: Z noltii: 32-50 10(-3) day(-1), and Z marina: 5-7
   10(-3) day(-1)), the two species, when they were dominant, exhibited
   comparable seasonal pattern with annual biomass maxima (215-226 and
   157-287 g DW m(-2) in Z noltii and Z marina, respectively) and shoot
   density maxima (2764-2944 and 152-296 shoots m(-2) in Z noltii and Z
   I,marina, respectively) in July and August. When they were not dominant,
   the two species displayed more patchy distribution and consistent
   reproductive effort (23-39\% of generative shoots) which affected their
   seasonal biomass pattern (April-June). Shoot size (length and weight)
   and the way population increased their standing crop appeared to be
   habitat dependent. The two species built up their biomass through shoot
   density in exposed area (SS) and through shoot size increase in
   sheltered area (NS). These results an discussed with regards to the
   coexistence of these two species within the same stand. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is a manganese-based
   gasoline additive used to enhance automobile performance. MMT has been
   used in Canadian gasoline for about 20 yr. Because of the potential for
   increased levels of Mn in particulate matter resulting from automotive
   exhausts, a large-scale population-based exposure study (similar to 1000
   participant periods) was conducted in Toronto, Canada, to estimate the
   distribution of 3-day average personal exposures to particulate matter
   (PEM2.5 and PM10) and Mn. A stratified, three-stage, two-phase
   probability, longitudinal sample design of the metropolitan population
   was employed. Residential indoor and outdoor, and ambient levels (at a
   fixed site and on a roof) of PM2.5, PM10, and Mn were also measured.
   Supplementary data on traffic counts, meteorology, MMT levels in
   gasoline, personal occupations, and activities (e.g. amount of vehicular
   usage) were collected. Overall precision (\%RSD) for analysis of
   duplicate co-located samples ranged from 2.5 to 5.0\% for particulate
   matter and 3.1 to 5.5\% for Mn. The detection limits were 1.47 and 3.45
   mu g m(-3) for the PM10 and PM2.5 fractions, respectively, and 5.50 and
   1.83 ng m(-3) for Mn in PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. These low
   detection limits permitted the reporting of concentrations for >98\% of
   the samples. For PM10, the personal particulate matter levels (median
   48.5 mu g m(-3)) were much higher than either indoor (23.1 mu g m(-3))
   or outdoor levels (23.6 mu g m(-3)). The median levels for PM2.5 for
   personal, indoor, and outdoor were 28.4, 15.4 and 13.2 mu g m(-3),
   respectively. The correlation between PM2.5 personal exposures and
   indoor concentrations was high (0.79), while correlations between
   personal and the outdoor, fixed site and roof site were low (0.16-0.27).
   Indoor Mn concentration distributions (in PM2.5 and PM10), unlike
   particulate matter, exhibited much lower and less variable levels that
   the corresponding outdoor data. The median personal exposure was 8.0 ng
   m(-3), compared with 4.7 and 8.6 ng m(-3), respectively, for the indoor
   and outdoor distributions. The highest correlations occurred for
   personal vs indoor data (0.56) and for outdoor vs roof site data (0.66),
   and vs fixed site data (0.56). The concentration of Mn in particulate
   matter, expressed in ppm (w/w), revealed that the fixed site was the
   highest, followed by the roof site, outdoor, indoor, and personal. The
   personal and indoor data showed a statistically significant correlation
   (0.68) while all other correlations between personal or indoor data and
   outdoor or fixed-site data were quite small. The low correlations of
   personal and indoor levels with outdoor levels suggest that different
   sources in the indoor and outdoor microenvironments produce particle
   matter with dissimilar composition. The correlation results indicate
   that neither the roof- nor fixed-site concentrations can adequately
   predict personal particulate matter or Mn exposures. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We studied the ranging behavior of translocated and non-translocated
   groups of Alouatta pigra in Belize, Central America from March 1994 to
   May 1995. Home range size, day-range length and monthly range size were
   determined for all groups. In high density populations, home range size
   and day-range length increased with group size. Home range size
   increased with translocation to a low density population, but day-range
   length did not, and neither were affected by group size. These patterns
   are consistent with differences in the distribution of important food
   resources in the two areas. The costs of translocation to A. pigra were
   not revealed by variation in ranging patterns between newly translocated
   and previously established groups but may be evident in the intensity of
   range use. Previously established groups use their ranges more
   intensively than newly translocated groups while the new groups explored
   the release site and then began to reuse areas explored earlier. Newly
   translocated groups generally established their home ranges six months
   after translocation but continued some exploration one year after they
   were moved. This suggests that a full year of monitoring is not
   necessarily sufficient to determine the size and location of the home
   ranges of translocated monkeys, but that monitoring should continue
   through all seasonal phases of food abundance. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Kokako Callaeas cinerea wilsoni (Callaeidae) populations are declining
   in unmanaged primary forests of the North Island, New Zealand. An 8-year
   experiment to determine the cause of decline was undertaken by
   controlling introduced browsing and predatory mammal pests in two forest
   areas, then monitoring pest abundance, kokako chick output and adult
   density in the managed forests and an unmanaged non-treatment block.
   Treatments were switched between the unmanaged and one of the managed
   areas after 3-4 years. Reduction of pests, especially brushtail possums
   Trichosurus vulpecula and ship rats Rattus rattus, to very low levels
   resulted in significant increases in kokako chick output and adult
   density in all three study populations. This was due primarily to
   increased success of nesting attempts, which then increased the number
   of pairs attempting to breed, initially as newly recruited young females
   formed pairs with residual single males. The `adaptive management'
   approach of using routine large-scale pest control in a co-ordinated
   experiment to directly test the pest-limitation hypothesis enabled
   researchers and managers to investigate the cause of decline and to
   increase populations simultaneously. Predation is a more immediate cause
   of current kokako declines than competition. Management to recover
   vulnerable kokako populations should aim to reduce possums and ship rats
   to very low levels (<1\% trap catch for possums; <1\% tracking rate for
   ship rats, using particular indexing techniques) at the onset of the
   kokako nesting season, for several consecutive years. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The gharial Gavialis gangeticus Gmelin is' endemic to the Indian
   subcontinent and was on the-verge of extinction in India by the
   mid-1970's. As a conservation measure, since 1979 captive reared
   gharials have been reintroduced in several protected areas. The
   reproductive success and hatchling survival in one of these managed
   populations was determined by monitoring 124 nests between 1987 and
   1989. Population rate of increase in a 425 km stretch of the Chambal
   River, National Chambal Sanctuary, was determined by surveys every
   alternate year between 1988 and 1992. The mean clutch size (36.51 +/-
   0.65 eggs) showed no significant variation between years (ANOVA, F =
   0.821, p = 0.443). Number of infertile eggs per clutch was (2.99 +/-
   1.160) and no significant difference in the mean number of infertile
   eggs per nest was found between years (ANOVA, F = 0.534, p = 0.588). The
   overall fertility was 91.8\%. and it did not vary among years (ANOVA, F
   = 0.075, p = 0.927). A substantial number of eggs (32.1\%) were lost
   between egg laying and hatching, largely due to eggs being damaged
   during nest searches, predation, desiccation and unknown reasons.
   Predation losses increased between 1987 and 1989, and varied
   significantly between years (ANOVA, F = 3.970, p = 0.021). During the
   study period the overall hatching success was 67.9\%. Mean recruitment
   of 1-year old to the population was 7.7, 8.8 in 1987-1988 and 6.6\% in
   1989-1990. This indicates 92.3\% hatchling mortality within the first
   year. The egg to post monsoon survivorship was 6.6\% in 1987-1988 and
   4.3\% in 1989-1990; with a mean of 5.5\% during the study period. The
   density of gharial increased from 1.93 gharial/river km in 1988 to 2.52
   during 1992. The overall exponential rate of increase in the population
   was 0.179 (p = 0.012) or equivalent to 19.6\% p.a between:1979 and 1992.
   The total number of nests increased from 45 in 1987 to 57 in 1989. The
   average annual exponential rate of increase in the nesting between 1979
   and 1989 was 0.149 (p = 0.002) or equivalent to 16;1\% p.a. Variations
   in egg and hatchling survivorship, inconsistency in the number of
   gharial released, the location and the time of release, and mortality in
   fishing nets are biases in the data. (C) 1998;Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{During the last 40 years, the once abundant and widespread Ara macao
   population in Costa Rica has been reduced to two major groups and one
   remnant group, which survive isolated from one another within three
   protected areas. To maintain the genetic diversity of one of these
   populations located within the Carara Biological Reserve, which is
   threatened by frequent poaching, an aviculture program was initiated for
   repatriation. This study is concerned with monitoring the genetic
   diversity of confiscated birds to use for this reintroduction. Sixteen
   confiscated animals were analyzed by DNA fingerprinting with
   oligonucleotide probes, which detect tandem repeats of the nucleotide
   sequences CAC and GGAT in microsatellites. Birds were sexed by
   amplification of a nonrepetitive DNA sequence region from the female W
   chromosome. Our data reveal a high genetic diversity among these
   individuals, with average band-sharing coefficients of 0.058 for the CAC
   repeat and 0.066 for GGAT. Only two pairs show a closer relationship.
   Our results suggest that there is still considerable genetic diversity
   within Costa Rican scarlet macaw populations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{I report an episode of anuran mortality and decline in the Reserva
   Forestal Fortuna, Chiriqui, Panama. The symptoms of decline at this site
   include population reductions, the presence of dead or dying adults, and
   tadpole abnormalities. Streamside anurans were abundant and diverse in
   1993-1995, were restricted to a few streams in December 1996-January
   1997, and then became rare throughout the reserve In July-August 1997
   Between December 1996 and January 1997, I found 54 dead or dying frogs
   belonging to 10 species, and 12\% of tadpoles had abnormalities of the
   oral disc. In July-August 1997 I monitored nine streams 37 times and
   captured only six individuals whereas 13 terrestrial surveys along five
   trails resulted in 18 captured individuals No dead or dying animals were
   found during those two months, but 11\% of tadpoles had mouthpart
   abnormalities. Necropsies revealed that 18 of 18 dead anurans had a
   fungal infection of the skin; because this fungus was the only infection
   shared among all dead frogs, I suggest that it killed them and
   contributed to the decline of these populations. The presence of mouth
   part abnormalities during a period of adult mortality suggests that this
   symptom may also be linked to the fungus infection. Clinical signs of
   decline in the anurans of Fortuna are similar to those found in the
   anurans of Monteverde and Las Tablas, Costa Rica, and I hypothesize that
   this pathogen was involved in the declines at all three sites.}},

Abstract = {{The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) population that nests at Tortuguero,
   Costa Rica, is the largest in the Atlantic by at least an order of
   magnitude. Surveys to monitor the nesting activity on the northern 18 km
   of the 36-km beach were initiated in 1971 and extended to the entire
   beach in 1986. Front the survey data, we estimated the total number of
   nesting emergences on the northern 18 km for each year from 1971 through
   1996. Evaluation of the trend in nesting emergences indicated a
   relatively consistent increase from 1971 to the mid-1980s, constant or
   perhaps decreasing nesting during the late 1980s, and then resumption of
   an upward trend in the 1990s. Evaluation of trends in sea turtle nesting
   populations requires many years of data because of the large degree of
   annual variation in nesting numbers The trends reported in this study
   must be evaluated with caution for several reasons. First, if the the
   mean number of nests deposited by each female each year (clutch
   frequency) varies significantly among years, changes in the number of
   nesting emergences among years could reflect changes in the number of
   nesting females, clutch frequency, or both. Second, we only assessed the
   trend in one segment of the population (mature females), which may or
   may not represent the trend of the entire green turtle population and
   which, because of late maturity, may not reflect changes in juvenile
   mortality for many years. Third, survey frequency, and thus confidence
   in annual estimates varied among years. The upward population trend must
   be assessed from the perspective of the catastrophic decline that the
   Caribbean green turtle populations have experienced since the arrival of
   Europeans. If careful management is continued in Costa Rica and adopted
   throughout the region,the collapse of the Caribbean green turtle
   populations-which seemed imminent in the 1950s-can be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{The history of wildlife management in the national parks can be traced
   in the ungulate management policies of the National Park Service (NPS).
   These policies have, at various times, embraced total protection at the
   expense of other species, authorized culling to maintain explicit
   population levels, and since 1970 advocated natural regulation combined
   with limited human interference with park ecosystems. Current policy has
   had important ramifications for ungulate populations in parks as
   discussed in the preceding papers in this Invited Feature. This paper
   synthesizes those papers, interpreting the answers to three questions in
   relation to NPS wildlife management: (1) how does this management differ
   from other public resource managers; (2) can thresholds for management
   intervention be established for the species of concern; and (3) is
   scientific knowledge adequate to make and implement management
   decisions? The paper finds that NPS management does differ significantly
   from other federal land management and state wildlife management
   agencies, which is a factor complicating coordination and understanding
   of management approaches. It concludes that management thresholds can be
   and have been established in the past; however, given the ecological
   complexity of parks, scientific support for such thresholds will
   probably always be inadequate. This situation argues for an experimental
   management approach with continued monitoring of conditions both in and
   outside the parks.}},

Abstract = {{We used a case study of a coastal bottlenose dolphin population to
   present a framework for determining the number of individuals present
   and assessing the likely time scale over which trends in abundance may
   be determined. Such a framework is appropriate for animal species that
   possess natural markings sufficient for individual recognition, and may
   be valuable in the development and implementation of management and
   monitoring programs for vulnerable populations.
   Population abundance was estimated using mark-recapture methods applied
   to photoidentification data. This experiment was designed to minimize
   violation of method assumptions so as to allow use of the most
   parsimonious model for analysis. The data were examined critically to
   investigate mark-recapture assumptions, while analytical methods and
   data were selected to minimize and, where necessary, account for
   violations. The estimated number of animals with long-lasting marks from
   left and right side estimates were 73 +/- 12 and 80 +/- 11 individuals,
   respectively (means +/- 1 se). When divided by the estimated proportion
   of such animals in the population (0.57 +/- 0.043 and 0.61 +/- 0.035,
   respectively) and averaged, weighted by inverse variance, a total
   population size of 129 +/- 15 individual animals was estimated (95\% CI
   = 110-174 animals).
   Data on calves observed and carcasses recovered suggest that the
   population could be increasing or decreasing at an annual rate of up to
   5\%. A power analysis, undertaken to investigate the length of
   monitoring program required to detect changes in population abundance at
   a 90\% level of certainty, showed that detection of a trend could only
   occur following >8 yr of research effort. Biennial sampling has power
   similar to that of annual sampling, but savings in resources are offset
   by the loss of data on the reproductive histories of individuals.}},

Abstract = {{1. This study attempts to identify the main community characteristics
   that contribute to variability in dung beetle assemblage composition and
   structure across a range of spatial and temporal scales.
   2, Dung beetle assemblages (Aphodius, Sphaeridium, and Geotrupes
   species) were monitored by: dung-baited pitfall trapping at: 10-day
   intervals during the seasonally active period at eleven. sites in
   southern ireland. Three of the sites were monitored over at lease 2
   years between 1991 and 1996.
   3, Although the species composition of the above taxonomic groups was
   comparable among sites and years, relative abundances of component
   species varied considerably. Detrended correspondence analysis
   ordinations indicated a similar level of variability in dung beetle
   assemblage structure among years, and among sites approximate to 1-180
   km apart.
   4. Processes that may contribute to spatio-temporal variability in dung
   beetle assemblages are discussed, and strategies for future research are
   suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Application of a sentinel species-based population evaluation using
   creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), a common minnow in eastern North
   America, could provide a framework for environmental assessments and
   focus future research in small streams. Analysis of creek chub endpoints
   (growth, condition, fecundity) was based on an assessment framework for
   white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) populations (Gibbons \&
   Munkittrick, 1994). We evaluated creek chub and fish community endpoints
   simultaneously in two streams with differing degrees of urbanization,
   agriculture, and thermal regimes during spring, summer, and fall. Fish
   from the more altered stream appear to be suffering from a feeding-based
   niche shift, and demonstrate reproductive anomalies suggestive of
   exposure to some unknown sublethal stressor(s). Fish community
   assessments identified modified habitat and water quality but did not
   detect the presence of any additional stressor(s). Similarity in fish
   community and population responses, widespread distribution of creek
   chub, limited within-stream movements, and the ability of this species
   to populate even the smallest streams where the resident fish community
   may be depauperate and fish community-type assessments limited, makes
   the potential use of creek chub as a monitor for small streams promising
   over a wide geographic zone.}},

Abstract = {{The use of felt traps to estimate oviposition by the cabbage root fly,
   Delia radicum (L.), and turnip root fly, Delia floralis (Fall.), was
   compared with soil sampling at seven localities between 1992 and 1994 in
   Denmark and Norway. In all, 281 comparisons were made, based on 6800
   samples. In 4.6\% of these comparisons no eggs were found by either
   method. In 16\% of the comparisons, 2.0 +/- 0.41 (+/- S.E.) eggs were
   found per soil sample and no eggs were found in felt traps, whereas in
   0.7\% of the comparisons 0.10 +/- 0.03 eggs were found per felt trap and
   no eggs in soil samples. When eggs were found using both methods, the
   ratio between soil sampling and felt traps varied from 13.1 +/- 3.2 when
   the egg laying rate was very low to 1.8 +/- 0.2 at high egg laying
   rates. Regression analysis showed significant correlation between felt
   trap catches and soil sampling (P < 0.001), whereas locality did not
   influence felt trap efficiency (P=0.096). The influence of the physical
   conditions of felt traps, i.e., whether they were clean and dry, were
   analysed in a single year. Tentative action thresholds for control
   measures against cabbage root flies and turnip root flies were developed
   for cauliflower, Brassica oleracea, convar. botrytis (L.) Alef., var.
   botrytis, based on data from the literature and the present results.}},

Abstract = {{Models of the dynamics of forest caterpillars and viral disease are
   sensitive to virus persistence at low host densities. Nuclear polyhedral
   virus could persist in the environment on tree bark or in the soil, or
   by infecting caterpillars even at low host population numbers. We
   monitored populations of western tent caterpillars at 4 locations in
   southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to describe the relationship
   between host numbers and viral infection and to determine if virus is
   maintained in low populations of caterpillar hosts. We evaluated the
   persistence of virus on tents. Vital infection was detected by DNA-dot
   blotting of larvae and extracts from field-collected tents. Although
   active virus persisted over winter on experimentally contaminated tents,
   few tents collected from low field populations were positive for viral
   contamination. Tents are therefore unlikely to be a source of
   environmental contamination when host numbers are low. Virus was
   generally, but not always present in a few larvae even in years of low
   host numbers. In 2 populations the level of infection increased with
   host numbers, and it remained high at the beginning of the decline in 1
   population but decreased to a low level even at high host numbers in the
   other. Western tent caterpillars at 2 mainland locations did not show a
   typical pattern of cyclic population fluctuation and for these the
   levels of viral infection did not vary consistently with host numbers.
   Presence or absence of infection was not related to the size of the egg
   mass from which the family of larvae hatched although egg masses
   associated with contaminated tents tended to be smaller than those of
   noncontaminated tents.}},

Abstract = {{In the late 1980s, a new outbreak of the introduced winter moth,
   Operophtera brumata (L.), occurred in Richmond, on the lower mainland of
   British Columbia. This was accompanied Ly the introduced parasitoid,
   Cyzenis albicans (Fallen). Populations were monitored at 2 birch
   woodlands and 2 blueberry plots between 1989 and 1993. Parasitism by C,
   albicans and predation by generalist predators were important mortality
   factors during the outbreak. Predation of moth pupae increased at all
   sites between 1989 and 1990. Parasitism by C. albicans caused
   significant mortality each year reaching a maximum in 1991 and remaining
   high through to 1993 at birch sites. The winter moth populations
   collapsed simultaneously in 1992 at all study sites, despite different
   levels of parasitism and 2 very different host plants. As the outbreak
   collapsed at Richmond, the moth continued to increase in numbers and
   cause severe defoliation of birch at new sites in southern Vancouver
   where parasitism remained low. C albicans is unable to prevent the
   initial outbreak of winter-moth even when the 2 species are introduced
   simultaneously. The parasitoid requires high density host populations
   before becoming well established, but may contribute sufficient
   additional mortality to prevent subsequent prolonged outbreaks. The
   control of high density winter moth populations in North America by C,
   albicans supports the hypothesis that natural enemies that are rare in
   their native habitat will be effective control agents when released into
   exotic habitats without competitors or their own natural enemies.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of the health effects of pesticides have concentrated on
   occupational exposure. Little is known about community environmental
   exposure to agricultural pesticides. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate nonoccupational pesticide exposure among farmers' families
   in rural El Salvador, a country known for intensive use of extremely
   toxic compounds. The study population included all residents 8 years and
   older living in five agricultural communities in El Salvador. Current
   exposure to organophosphate insecticides (OPs) was established through
   analysis of urine samples for alkyl phosphate metabolites of OPs. Nearly
   half of 358 analyzed samples had detectable levels of OP metabolities.
   Of subjects not performing agricultural fieldwork, 30\% nonetheless
   excreted detectable levels of metabolities. Similar rates held for
   children and adults. The best independent predictors for an individual's
   excretion of OP metabolites were (a) performing fieldwork during the
   past 2 weeks, (b) the head household farmer's application of OPs during
   the past 2 years, and (c) the household mother reporting use of OPs in
   the home or yard. The latter factors were significantly associated with
   metabolite excretion regardless of whether the individual had done
   fieldwork. The results of this study support the hypothesis that a large
   proportion of rural Salvadorans, including: children, is exposed to
   pesticides through environmental as well as occupational routes. (C)

Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{12-21}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Contributing to the controversies that have surrounded fish hatcheries
   in recent years are a number of misconceptions or myths about hatcheries
   and their effects on natural populations. These myths impede productive
   dialogue among those with differing views about hatcheries. Most of the
   myths include a measure of truth, which makes it difficult to recognize
   the elements that are not true. Consideration of these myths leads to
   the following conclusions: (1) Hatcheries are intrinsically neither good
   nor bad-their value can be determined only in the context of clearly
   defined goals; (2) genetic changes in cultured populations can be
   reduced but not eliminated entirely; (3) empirical evidence exists of
   many adverse effects of hatcheries, but some risks have been overstated;
   and ( 1) monitoring and evaluation programs are important but should not
   be used as a substitute For developing risk-averse hatchery programs in
   the first place. A key step in resolving some of the controversies will
   be moving toward agreement on a common version (rather than two or more
   separate versions) of the realities about hatcheries. More efforts are
   needed in four major al eas: identifying goals, conducting overall
   cost:benefit analyses to guide policy decisions, improving the
   information base, and dealing with uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Weirs and traps were used to monitor the movement of two strains of
   stocked brown trout, Salmo trutta L. Within 24 h of stocking, 15\% (n =
   13) of a Danish strain and 21\% (n = 19) of a hybrid strain moved at
   least 100 m from their release site. In the following 5-6 days, no
   further movement was found for Danish fish, but hybrid fish continued to
   move, totaling 32\% (n = 29) of the fish stocked. During this same
   period, 36 wild brown trout (approximate to 3.5\% of the population)
   were captured, moving over the weirs. Two weeks later, and one week
   after a flood, 70\% (n = 59) of the Danish strain were recovered within
   their release sites and 89\% (n = 76) were recovered during an electric
   fishing survey within the 3.5-km-long experimental area. In contrast,
   43\% (n = 31) of the hybrid strain were recaptured in their release
   sites and 49\% (n = 45) within the experimental area. The total
   recapture of wild adult fish was only 16\% (n = 41). The flooding event
   was insignificant in comparison with strain-specific behaviours in
   determining patterns of movement and residency.}},

Abstract = {{1. Conifers have a tendency to produce detrimental changes in the soil
   that suppress decomposition. It is also possible that clear-felling and
   the short plantation rotation (40-50 years), usual in Britain, will
   eventually cause nutrient depletion. Decomposition rates are important
   in determining the level of nutrients available, to both the crop and
   the soil invertebrate community, and this study has compared them at
   three stages during the plantation cycle.
   2. Cotton cloth buried in the soil of open areas decomposed at twice the
   rate of cloth buried in the soil of closed canopy plantations.
   3. The rate of decomposition in the soil layer 0-80 mm from the surface
   was 1.5 times that in the 81-160 mm layer.
   4. In young plantations, the decomposition rate of cloth decreased with
   an increase in the age of the plantation. It is suggested that the
   decrease in decomposition rate with plantation age is associated with
   increased shading and a decrease in the amplitude of the diurnal
   temperature cycle.
   5. Springtail (Collembola) densities were high in spring on an open area
   and decreased in summer. The opposite occurred in the closed canopy
   plantation. Drying on the exposed open area is suggested as the cause of
   the decreased summer densities.
   6. On the site where Collembola densities were monitored, decomposition
   rates were higher in the upper soil layer of the closed canopy
   plantation than in an open area. It is probable that this was due to the
   upper layers on the exposed area drying, rather than to the high
   Collembola densities checking fungal decomposition.
   7. The nutrient release that accompanies decomposition has potential
   importance for the rate of growth of the conifer crop. This preliminary
   study suggests that the decomposition rate is highest in the years
   immediately after felling, probably favouring the establishment of the
   next rotation.
   8. This study has not detected suppression of decomposition on open or
   clear-felled areas in Hamsterley Forest (NZ0530), suggesting that
   present planting and harvesting methods are appropriate and should
   continue. However, further investigation of the interactions between
   fungi, meso- and macrofauna is needed to understand both nutrient
   cycling and the invertebrate community structure in plantation forestry.}},

Abstract = {{1. Earthworms (Annelida: Oligochaeta) were sampled on four occasions
   (spring, summer, autumn and winter) at 14 sites along two transects from
   a primary lead/zinc/cadmium smelting works at Avonmouth, UK,
   2. Total abundance and biomass of earthworms decreased with proximity to
   the smelter. No worms were collected from the two sites closest to the
   factory (<0.6 km) and catches were significantly lower than controls at
   a further five sites (<3 km).
   3. Seasonal composition of sampled communities differed only for summer
   with lower numbers of individuals and species collected at all sites.
   Reduced catches in the summer sample is a response to drought.
   4. Species richness was lowest at sites close to the factory. For
   example, worms such as Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny) and
   Allolobophora chlorotica (Savigny) that were dominant at relatively
   clean sites further from the smelter are absent from the most
   contaminated soils.
   5. Reduced species richness resulted in lower Shannon-Weiner diversity
   and higher Berger-Parker dominance. Multivariate cluster analysis for
   spring, summer and winter indicated that sites could be split into three
   groups based upon relative species composition. In autumn, two clusters
   were identified.
   6. The absence of sensitive species from sites close to the smelting
   works supports the inclusion of earthworms as a key group in a
   terrestrial prediction and classification scheme for quantifying the
   effects of pollutants on soil biodiversity. However, sampling should be
   carried out in spring or autumn to obtain an accurate picture of
   community structure.}},

Abstract = {{1 We monitored flowering and fruiting of individual male and female
   plants of Oemleria cerasiformis over a 6-year period in a population in
   western Canada, and calculated fruit set (percentage of pistils
   maturing) and reproductive effort (RE) (gram of reproductive tissue per
   gram of leaf).
   2 Over 6 years, male O. cerasiformis had on average much lower total RE,
   but much higher RE at flowering, than females.
   3 In males, strong correlations between RE and light suggested that
   investment in reproduction was largely determined by light levels. There
   were strong positive correlations of RE between years, with no evidence
   of periodic fluctuations.
   4 In females, in contrast to males, RE at flowering was not related to
   light. However, fruit set was strongly correlated with light. Flowering
   RE and fruit set were uncorrelated in females, indicating that these are
   affected by different factors.
   5 Correlations of RE between years in females, although often
   significant, were lower than in males, indicating that RE fluctuates
   more between years in females than in males and may respond to past
   levels of RE. Flowering may reflect adjustments in response to past
   reproduction, or may be controlled by resources other than light. Fruit
   set was not significantly related to previous RE.
   6 The greater total RE of females and their limited ability to adjust
   fruit set are probably major factors contributing to the greater
   mortality rates of females and the male-biased sex ratios in O.
   cerasiformis.}},

Abstract = {{Baseline carbaryl susceptibility and potential resistance mechanisms
   were identified in U.S. populations of western corn rootworm, Diabrotica
   virgifera virgifera LeConte, using lethal concentration, diagnostic
   concentration, and synergism bioassays. Twenty-two adult rootworm
   populations were examined from the states of Indiana, Illinois: Iowa,
   Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Virginia.
   Lethal concentration bioassays, conducted within carbaryl-coated glass
   vials on 12 populations, identified resistance in only 2 Nebraska
   populations. A diagnostic concentration of carbaryl was subsequently
   identified which caused 100 and 40\% mortality in standard susceptible
   and known resistant populations, respectively. In diagnostic
   concentration bioassays on all 22 populations, substantial decreases in
   mortality were observed only in 3 populations from outside of Nebraska.
   Synergism bioassays on standard susceptible and resistant Nebraska
   populations indicated significant reductions in resistance levels with
   inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and esterases,
   suggesting an involvement in resistance by both these classes of
   detoxification enzymes. Results are discussed with respect to the
   validation of diagnostic concentration bioassays as a resistance
   monitoring tool for existing corn rootworm areawide management programs,
   and the potential roles of cytochromes P450 and esterases in carbaryl
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to determine the response of female oriental
   fruit flies, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), and 2 fruit fly parasitoids,
   Fopius arisanus (Sonan) and Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead), to
   the color, shape, and size of visual sticky traps. Numbers of females
   captured on yellow spheres increased as sphere size increased with
   diameters of 5-11 cm. Preference of females for yellow spheres over
   green and red spheres was positively correlated with sphere size.
   Yellow-colored spheres and rectangular blocks of equivalent surface area
   were equally attractive to females; however, females were more attracted
   to red spheres than to red blocks of equivalent surface area. The
   influence of background colors on the attractiveness of spheres was
   investigated by comparing the response of flies to 8 color combinations
   of the panels and spheres of Ladd traps. Standard Ladd traps, with red
   spheres attached to the center of yellow panels, captured more females
   than any other trap tested and could be used to monitor populations of
   oriental fruit flies in orchards. Female oriental fruit flies may be
   attracted to standard Ladd traps because of the visual contrast of red
   spheres against a light background.}},

Title = {{A comparative study of ultraviolet radiation tolerance in different

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{387-400}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A series of experiments was conducted to test the hypothesis that
   populations of Diaptomus minutus routinely experiencing high levels of
   ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are more tolerant of UVR than are those that
   routinely experience low levels of UVR. The relative degree of UVR
   tolerance was determined by monitoring mortality induced by either lamp
   or solar UVR. Diaptomus minutus from the low-dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), high-UVR Lake Giles were consistently more tolerant of lamp and
   solar UVR than were those from the moderate-DOG, low UVR Lake Lacawac.
   This difference in WR tolerance was apparent throughout the year in
   freshly collected animals, but it did not persist in cultured animals.
   The lamp UVR tolerances of cultured D.minutus were similar, except for
   those initiated from September collections. The September culture of
   Lake Giles animals was significantly more tolerant than the Lake Giles
   cultures initiated in December, May and June. The September culture of
   Lake Lacawac animals was significantly more tolerant than the June
   culture. The lamp UVR tolerance of freshly collected Lake Giles animals
   was greatest from late June through October, but the Lake Lacawac
   population was least tolerant in July and August. No differences in lamp
   WR tolerances were detected between animals collected from the surface
   and those collected from deeper water of either lake. It is concluded
   that the Lake Giles population was more tolerant than the Lake Lacawac
   population and that the period of greatest tolerance occurred several
   months after the time period with the highest ambient levels of solar
   UVR. Collectively, the experiments with both field and
   laboratory-cultured animals suggest that acclimation time plays a large
   role in WR tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Data from a PM2.5 (i.e., D-p < 2.5 mu m) particulate matter monitoring
   network was used to quantify the effects of outdoor pyrotechnic displays
   on the regional air quality of western Washington State. Linear
   regression and principal component analysis demonstrated that the fine
   particulate matter generated by these displays was primarily composed of
   Sr, K, V, Ti, Ba, Cu, Pb, Mg, Al, S, Mn, Zn, and soot. The maximum
   24-hour averaged PM2.5 mass concentration apportioned to the pyrotechnic
   displays by absolute principal component scores regression analysis was
   18.5 mu g/m(3). The majority of this mass (54\%) was composed of It and
   S, which originated from the combustion of black powder. The
   distribution of smoke emissions from the displays closely resembled the
   population distribution of western Washington. The PM2.5 aerosol
   monitoring network tracked the pyrotechnic smoke plume for a period of
   two days as it was advected by low-level winds. The geometric mass mean
   diameter of the It particles was similar to 0.7 mu m after transport of
   similar to 100 km. In the absence of rain, which is the primary sink for
   particles of this size, the particulate matter generated by the
   pyrotechnic displays could have an atmospheric residence time of more
   than one week.}},

Abstract = {{A large-scale experimental landscape study was conducted to examine the
   use of corridors and the forest matrix habitat by the hispid cotton rat
   (Sigmodon hispidus). The role of micro-habitat selection by S. hispidus
   in influencing routes of movement was also investigated. The
   experimental landscape consisted of ten 1.64-ha patches (each 128 x 128
   m) established in a loblolly (Pinus teada) forest. Four of the patches
   were isolated while the other six were connected in pairs by a 32-m wide
   corridor. Cotton rats (N = 96) were simultaneously released into both an
   isolated and connected patch, and monitored by radiotelemetry for 10
   days. We found that the forest matrix was not a barrier to movements of
   cotton rats. Fifty percent of the cotton rats moved through the matrix.
   Corridors had no significant effect on the number of animals leaving
   connected patches (60\%) compared to isolated patches (50\%). However,
   corridors were the preferred route to leave a connected patch.
   Colonization success for cotton rats leaving connected and isolated
   patches did not significantly differ. Cotton rats exhibited
   micro-habitat preferences and these preferences differed within
   patch/corridor and matrix habitats. In patch/corridor habitats, cotton
   rats selected sites with tall (>1 m) shrubs and high percent cover. In
   the forest matrix, cotton rats selected sires with abundant cover by
   vines and low tree canopy cover. Movement patterns of Sigmodon hispidus
   are not strongly influenced by large-scale landscape spatial structures.
   Micra-habitat selection, however, does influence movement patterns.
   These findings have important implications regarding habitat
   connectivity for small mammals.}},

Abstract = {{The age structure of mosquito populations is of great relevance to
   understanding the dynamics of disease transmission and in monitoring the
   success of control operations. Unfortunately, the ovarian dissection
   methods currently available for determining the age of adult mosquitoes
   are technically difficult, slow and may be of limited value, because the
   proportion of diagnostic ovarioles in the ovary declines with age. By
   means of reversed-phase HPLC this study investigated the malaria vectors
   Anopheles gambiae and An, stephensi to see if changes in fluorescent
   pteridine pigments, which have been used in other insects to determine
   the age of field-caught individuals, may be useful for age determination
   in mosquitoes. Whole body fluorescence was inversely proportional to age
   (P < 0.001, r(2) > 91\%) up to 30 days postemergence, with the
   regression values: y = 40580-706x for An. gambiae, and y = 52896-681x
   for An, stephensi. In both species the main pteridines were 6-biopterin,
   pterin-6-carboxylic acid and an unidentified fluorescent compound. An.
   gambiae had only 50-70\% as much fluorescence as An, Stephensi, and
   fluorescent compounds were relatively more concentrated in the bead than
   in the thorax (ratios 1:0.8 An. gambiae; 1:0.5 An. stephensi). The
   results of this laboratory study are encouraging. It seems feasible that
   this simpler and faster technique of fluorescence quantification could
   yield results of equivalent accuracy to the interpretation of ovarian
   dissection. A double-blind field trial comparing the accuracy of this
   technique to marked, released and recaptured mosquitoes is required to
   test the usefulness of the pteridine method in the field.}},

   treatments}},

Abstract = {{Three fields of marine clay soil were fumigated with 150 l/ha
   1,3-dichloropropene (DD) (Telone Pi(TM), Shell 95(TM)). On three dates
   after application, concentrations of Z- and E- 1,3-dichloropropene were
   measured per 5 cm layer of soil to a depth of 40 cm and integrals of
   concentration time products were calculated. When the fumigant was no
   longer detectable, a top soil treatment with either 150 l/ha
   metam-sodium or 180 kg/ha dazomet (active compound methyl
   isothiocyanate) was applied, followed immediately by autumn ploughing.
   Soil samples were taken before and after fumigation and after the top
   soil treatment to extract potato cyst nematodes (PCN). Survival was
   determined from hatching tests. Mortality after the DD treatment,
   defined as the complement of the percentage of survival, was estimated
   for each 5 cm layer of soil to a depth of 30 cm to construct dosage
   response curves. Fumigation with DD killed 48, 48, and 72\% of the PCN
   per field, respectively. Accelerated breakdown of DD by micro-organisms
   accounted for the two lower mortality rates. The additional top soil
   treatment with metam-sodium increased mortality to 90\% or more.
   Dazomet, however, was less effective (53 and 80\%) considering that
   twice as much of the active compound was applied as in the metam-sodium
   treatment. Multiplication, in pot experiments, of hatched juveniles
   originating from the injection layer after the DD treatment was 25\%
   less than that of those from untreated plots. This was caused by a lower
   fraction of juveniles developing into cysts. PCN could be retrieved from
   soil layers as deep as 80 cm below the surface. Fumigation reached only
   a fraction of the infested soil, down to 25-30 cm. The infestation foci
   were so small compared to the standard minimum area fumigated (1 ha)
   that 90\% of the active compound would be wasted on non-infested soil.
   Soil fumigation, whether or not combined with an additional top soil
   treatment, will seldom be profitable. Monitoring for infestation foci is
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of desiccation tolerance during germination has been described in
   general terms for many orthodox seeds and has been used as a framework
   to elucidate the mechanisms that confer tolerance to quiescent embryos.
   A more detailed description of the time course during which desiccation
   tolerance is lost Kill allow us to build a more comprehensive picture of
   the events that contribute to the toss of tolerance, To more thoroughly
   characterize the loss of desiccation tolerance, we monitored the
   viability of germinating pea (Pisum sativum L, cv,Alaska) seeds after
   drying them to a range of moisture contents, Desiccation tolerance is
   lost in different embryonic tissues at different times during
   germination, Thus, Hr looked separately at the effects of drying on
   radicle and epicotyl survival and on electrolyte leakage from the whole
   embryonic asis, Using statistical and graphical analysis. ne calculated
   the moisture content at which the population of germinating seeds began
   to be damaged by dehydration (threshold moisture content, TMC) and at
   which dehydration damaged the majority of the population (critical
   moisture content, CMC). CMCs and TMCs differed for each tissue and
   increased as germination progressed, TMCs appeared at 18 h of imbibition
   for radicle survival and electrolyte leakage and at 24 h for epicotyl
   survival. CMCs appeared at 21 h for radicle survival and electrolyte
   leakage., Among the asis tissues, epicotyls were the least sensitive to
   dehydration during germination, CMCs for epicotyl survival did not
   appear until 30 h of imbibition and did not increase to the extent that
   they did for either radicle survival or electrolyte leakage, Results
   from these experiments can be used as a framework to correlate the
   progression of biochemical and anatomical changes to the progressive
   loss of desiccation tolerance in germinating pea embryos.}},

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the fungal mycoparasite Coniothyrium minitans applied as a
   spray to crops infected with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (causal agent of
   white mold) on contamination of soil with S. sclerotiorum sclerotia was
   studied in a 5-year field experiment. Sclerotial survival also was
   monitored during two subsequent years, when the field was returned to
   commercial agriculture. In a randomized block design, factorial
   combinations of four crops and three treatments were repeated 10 times.
   Potato (Solanum tuberosum), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), carrot (Daucus
   carota), and chicory (Cichorium intybus), which are all susceptible to
   S. sclerotiorum, were grown in rotation. Plots were treated with C.
   minitans or Trichoderma spp. or were nontreated (control). Crops were
   rotated in each plot, but treatments were applied to the same plot every
   year. After 3 years during which it showed no effect on sclerotial
   survival, the Trichoderma spp. treatment was replaced by a single spray
   with C. minitans during the fourth and fifth years of the trial. The
   effect of treatments was monitored in subsequent seasons by counting
   apothecia as a measure of surviving S. sclerotiorum sclerotia and
   scoring disease incidence. Trichoderma spp. did not suppress S.
   sclerotiorum, but C. minitans infected at least 90\% of S, sclerotiorum
   sclerotia on treated crops by the end of the each season. C. minitans
   lowered the number of apothecia compared with the other treatments
   during the second year after the bean crop. C. minitans reduced the
   number of apothecia by approximate to 90\% when compared with the
   control and Trichoderma spp. treatments and reduced disease incidence in
   the bean crop by 50\% during the fifth year of the trial, resulting in a
   slightly higher yield. In 1993, but not 1994, a single spray with C.
   minitans was nearly as effective at reducing apothecia as three sprays
   (monitored in 1995). The final population size of sclerotia in soil at
   the end of the 7-year period was lower in all C. minitans plots than at
   the beginning of the trial, even in plots where two highly susceptible
   bean crops were grown during the period. The results indicate that the
   mycoparasite C. minitans has the potential to keep contamination of soil
   with sclerotia low in crop rotations with a high number of crops
   susceptible to S. sclerotiorum.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies have shown that primary infections of winter wheat crops
   by septoria tritici blotch are initiated in autumn by air-borne
   ascospores of the teleomorph stage, Mycosphaerella graminicola, which
   originate from sources outside the crop. Subsequent disease development
   within the crop, and damage to the upper leaves in summer, were commonly
   ascribed to the anamorph stage, Septoria tritici, which first arises
   from primary, ascosporic lesions and develops to give rise to
   splash-borne pycnidiospores produced in pycnidia. Trapping studies,
   using a Burkard volumetric trap sited adjacent to field trials of winter
   wheat, skewed that ascospores are released from pseudothecia throughout
   the year; peak release is not restricted to the autumn and early winter
   when the primary infections occur. As M. graminicola ascospores can be
   confused with those of other species, their authenticity was established
   by incubating ascospores on trap tapes for 24-48 h before counting.
   Examination of wheat plants cv. Riband, removed from unsprayed crops
   just prior to harvest and exposed to external weather conditions over
   the winter in 1995 and 1996, showed that pseudothecia mature on residues
   of the upper leaf layers between August and March. However, peak
   development occurred in December/January, when there was a corresponding
   decline in pycnidial formation. On regenerated wheat in set-aside (left
   uncultivated) fields, sources of pseudothecia of M. graminicola were
   exhausted by February of the following year. Natural development of the
   teleomorph stage was monitored in an unsprayed crop of winter wheat cv.
   Riband during the 1996-97 season, and was present on leaf 8 at growth
   stage 32 (24 April) and on leaf 3 at growth stage 85 (8 July), then a
   week later, on both leaf 2 and the flag leaf. The temporal development
   of M. graminicola asexual and sexual phases was also studied in
   inoculation experiments under external weather conditions on pot-grown
   seedlings of winter wheat cv. Longbow, using inoculum from two
   single-ascospore cultures.}},

Abstract = {{To define the temporal and spatial patterns of agonism and foraging
   activity in blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), we monitored five
   free-ranging animals in the Rhode River subestuary of the central
   Chesapeake Bay by ultrasonic telemetry during the summers of 1991-93,
   The interdependence between the two activities was of special interest.
   High crab densities have been associated with more frequent aggressive
   interactions and decreased foraging success in previous laboratory
   studies. High crab population density is correlated with increased
   frequency of aggression-related injury (autotomy) and cannibalism in the
   field. Consequently, we predicted that as crabs aggregate to clam
   patches during feeding periods in the field, the level of aggressive
   interactions would increase. In early trials, we collected data on
   location and agonistic activity (the stereotypical spreading of the
   chelae in the `meral spread' threat display) of crabs moving freely in
   the estuary by using single-channel telemetry transmitters. With
   subsequent technological advancements, we received simultaneous data on
   agonism and feeding.
   Crabs exhibited a diel pattern of agonism with peaks in threat display
   occurring in mornings and sometimes in evenings. Crabs fitted with
   single-channel telemetry transmitters were observed interacting
   aggressively most often at times previously identified as feeding
   periods, although the highest levels of agonism came slightly later than
   periods associated with the highest levels of feeding. Simultaneous
   telemetry of the two behaviors indicated that periods of increased
   agonism and feeding overlapped. Feeding activity tended to wane as
   threat activity increased, consistent with the hypothesis that
   aggressive interference impairs foraging. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science BN.

Abstract = {{The freshwater bivalve Hyridella depressa accumulates metals in
   extracellular granules distributed through its tissues and the elemental
   content of these granules was examined by X-ray microanalysis. The
   influence of two specimen-preparation techniques, chemical fixation and
   freeze-substitution, on the elemental data generated by granule
   microanalysis was compared to assess their application for environmental
   monitoring. Chemical fixation and wet sectioning resulted in lower
   proportions of Ca and Mn, and higher proportions of Fe, P, Cu, Zn and Pb
   compared with freeze-substitution and dry sectioning. Chemical fixation
   and wet sectioning also resulted in an increase in among-mussel
   variability. Wet sectioning of freeze-substituted tissue yielded similar
   results to chemical fixation and wet sectioning, suggesting that much of
   the dissolution and redistribution of elements associated with the
   chemical fixation procedure was due to aqueous processing. Granule
   microanalysis is a new approach to monitoring metal levels in the
   environment. Comparison of the data obtained by the two preparatory
   methods by analysis of variance and multi-dimensional scaling revealed
   the necessity of cryopreparation for maintaining elemental distribution
   and concentration. Use of the granules as biomonitors may be
   particularly useful when used with the mantle biopsy method for
   non-destructive sampling of mussel populations. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Possible stimulatory or acaricidal effects of thiodicarb, dimethoate and
   endosulfan on the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch,
   were tested in a glasshouse. Population development of T. urticae was
   monitored, with the expectation that any stimulatory or acaricidal
   effects would be reflected in different population growth relative to
   untreated plants. Acaricidal activity of the three insecticides was also
   investigated using a standard bioassay technique. Population growth on
   thiodicarb- or dimethoate-treated plants was no different to that on
   untreated plants but was slower on plants treated with endosulfan.
   Bioassays showed that endosulfan was moderately acaricidal, that T.
   urticae was highly resistant to dimethoate and that thiodicarb was of
   very low acaricidal activity. No evidence of stimulatory effects of
   dimethoate or thiodicarb was found. The data suggest that stimulation is
   an unlikely explanation for outbreaks of T. urticae in cotton and that
   endosulfan sprayed for control of Helicoverpa spp. may delay the

Abstract = {{The effects of tree bark-stripping by Sika deer (Cervus nippon) on
   population dynamics of forest trees were studied in a cool-temperate
   mixed forest in Ohdaigahara, western Japan. Detailed observation of all
   trees greater than or equal to 2 cm in diameter at breast height in a 1
   ha plot for 2 years showed that stems of Abies homolepis, Clethra
   barvinervis, Viburnum furcatum, Stewartia pseudo-camellia and Ilex
   geniculata suffered serious bark-stripping by deer. Smaller stems of A.
   homolepis were girdled all at once, and dead soon after that. Larger
   stems were bark-stripped Little by little, and did not die unless
   completely girdled. Stems of C. barvinervis and S. pseudo-camellia did
   not die soon after bark-stripping even if completely bark-stripped. The
   tree population monitored in two 0.2 ha belt transects for 15 years
   demonstrated that the mortality of A. homolepis and V. furcatum has
   increased consistently, especially in the last 5 years. In contrast, no
   tendencies were found for Fagus crenata, Pourthiaea villosa and
   Symplocos coreana; these species were seldom bark-stripped by deer.
   Recruitment rate in the whole forest decreased in recent years. Thus the
   density of smaller trees decreased due to high mortality of
   bark-stripped species and low recruitment rate for all species. Though
   the bark of trees is less important as forage for deer than green forage
   such as dwarf bamboo, bark-stripping does more serious damage to trees
   than browsing on leaves and twigs because the injury by bark-stripping
   does not readily recover and kills considerably large trees. The ratio
   of canopy gap will be increased by browsing unless the density of deer
   is reduced. Furthermore, bark-stripping accelerates the increase of
   canopy gap ratio. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pteropus poliocephalus is endemic to coastal eastern Australia (20-28
   degrees S), where infrequent, but extreme droughts and floods, commonly
   across large parts of the range, cause major swings in the availability
   of forage -primarily eucalypt blossom, supplemented with fruits and
   leaves. It can establish camps in most types of closed vegetation > 3 m
   in height and it can breed opportunistically. Nevertheless, camp
   occupation is persistent in most areas in most years, and most births
   coincide with the southern spring. Mean (+/- SD) age at recovery of
   banded animals was 40.4 (+/- 18.8) months; the oldest was 96 months (30
   recovered/1840 banded). Seventy-six percent of foraging records (n =
   433) were within 20 kin of the camp of origin. Pteropus poliocephalus
   has experienced a range reduction since European settlement and it is
   widely believed to be vulnerable to extinction. Possible causes of a
   decline are climate change, competition with congenerics, habitat loss
   and modification, and pest control. Conservation effort has been
   expended primarily on protective legislation, reservation, and promotion
   of the benefits of P. poliocephalus as well as other flying-foxes; the
   problems they cause (mostly off-reserve) have been poorly addressed and
   monitoring has been inadequate. Collaborative management by major
   stakeholders (= cost-bearers) would facilitate both the development of
   cost-effective and benign methods for excluding flocks from
   inappropriate areas, and monitoring of population status. Measures
   developed to manage P. poliocephalus could inform management of other
   flying-foxes for most problems are generic.}},

Abstract = {{Major developments are occurring in aquaculture, various of which
   involve application of molecular biology and biotechnological
   approaches. These comprise such critical areas as animal reproduction,
   growth and development, nutrition, and disease control and drug
   delivery. Also included are innovative approaches to management
   techniques in fish feeding systems. A variety of monitoring methodology
   to maintain water quality and achieve optimal feed conversion rates,
   along with innovative aquaculture engineering practices, represent
   significant developments in aquaculture. Efforts are being made to
   produce fish with elevated growth rates using biosynthetic fish growth
   hormones. In disease control, novel drug delivery systems are being
   examined for efficient vaccination of farmed fish, along with
   development of disease resistant and harder genetic stock. Specific
   examples can be readily seen in research in genetics of tilapia, leading
   to improved stocks. Basic research is occurring in state-of-the-art
   genetic techniques involving chromosomal manipulation, production of
   monosex populations, gene transfer, and molecular discrimination and
   gene mapping. Distinctive species/strain characteristics involving
   production related traits, i.e., temperature and salinity tolerances,
   fecundity, and feeding habits and growth all are being studied, leading
   ultimately to more successful aquaculture practices. Other technological
   approaches are being used in bioremediation practices involving
   application of selected microorganisms to control critical
   microbial/ecological processes in the culture system itself. Such
   probiotic applications allow more effective use of supplemental feed and
   maintenance of a more balanced culture system, especially in decreased
   buildup of potentially hazardous compounds. With such reduction of
   stress-related factors, improvements in growth and survival of the
   aquatic species are anticipated. These considerations assume noteworthy
   significance under intensive culture conditions and where sustainability
   of the farming operations is critical.}},

Abstract = {{Belgium has five major urban areas or conurbations with a total
   population of 2 million people, representing 20\% of the total

   past and present sulphur dioxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide and ozone
   situation in the conurbations of Antwerpen, Brussel, Charleroi, Gent and
   Liege are summarized and analyzed over a period of 15 to 25 years.
   Major conclusions are marked downward trends in the ambient levels of
   sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and lead in all five conurbations
   reducing the present levels under all legal national and European limit
   values, and bringing them in general, beneath the guideline values for
   the protection of human health recommended by the World Health
   Organization. For ozone the trend over the past 10 to 15 years has been
   stationary. Ozone guideline values, as well as recommended threshold
   values are still frequently violated.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, over the
   past decade was accompanied by improved standard of living and increased
   population and associated activities and services such as
   transportation, electric power generation, and industrialization. As a
   result, the air quality both ambient and indoor became an important
   issue for the city. A funded research project was conducted during the
   period July 1992 through November 1994. The project was designed to
   evaluate indoor and ambient air quality in and around buildings of
   different types and uses in Riyadh. Thirty intercity buildings and two
   outercity (background) sites were carefully selected and monitored for
   air duality. Ten air pollutants, together with relevant meteorological
   parameters, were monitored indoor and outdoor at each site continuously
   and simultaneously for a period of two weeks covering summer and winter
   seasons.
   This paper discusses the results of three important and interrelated
   criteria pollutants (NO, NO2, and O-3) Results of this investigation
   showed NO and NO2 levels that are not acceptable and exceeded the
   standard indoor and outdoor in most locations. Ozone, on the other hand,
   showed levels that are acceptable in all locations. Statistical and
   frequency analyses were performed on the collected data, showing
   seasonal and sector by sector variability, and outdoor-indoor
   correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Moose (Alces alces) density, hunting pressure (days/km(2)), sport
   harvest, and harvest rate (\% of the population killed) were monitored
   in study blocks supporting different types and sizes of clear cuts in
   order to identify the impact of road access on moose hunting. The block
   with the lowest moose density (0.11 moose/km(2)) was the Control Block
   which was dominated by virtually unexploited mature coniferous stands.
   Densities were moderate to high in the cut blocks (0.22-0.58
   moose/km(2)). We measured a 3 - 6\% non-significant (P > 0.05) increase
   in harvest rate by sport hunting in 2 blocks surveyed before and after
   cutting. After cutting, harvest rate was moderate in the first (15.4\%)
   and high in the second block (23.7\%). In the blocks surveyed
   exclusively after cutting operations, harvest rates were high (23-29\%).
   Overall, among all blocks and years, harvest rate was 19.6\% before
   cutting and 23.5\% after. Hunting pressure increased in recently cut
   blocks but moose density and proximity from urban areas were as
   important as road access in influencing hunting pressure. Camp-hunters,
   who yielded the majority of harvested moose, did not rely exclusively on
   forest roads for access to their hunting sites. The majority of them
   (70\%) hunted in 2 km(2) or less, and consequently their hunting sites
   were not adequately protected by existing forest harvesting guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the demography of a population of Alaskan moose (Alces alces
   gigas) that was closed to immigration or emigration on Kalgin Island,
   Alaska, USA, from 1980 to 1987. This island population experienced
   neither severe weather nor predation from large mammalian carnivores.
   Effort and success by hunters was monitored carefully, and the age
   structure from harvested moose was used to estimate population size
   during each year. Moose were harvested heavily during permit hunts to
   reduce the population that had overshot carrying capacity. The estimated
   population declined from 212 to 8 moose between 1982 and 1986. Harvest
   was linearly related to population size, but moose killed per unit of
   hunter effort (CPUE) exhibited a disparate pattern with hunter success
   initially declining with population size but then increasing
   dramatically at lower population sizes of moose. The overall age
   structure of moose became younger as harvest reduced the size of the
   population. The percentage of moose 3.5 - 5.5, and 6.5 - 12.5 years old
   declined with population size, whereas 0.5 year-old moose increased as
   the population declined. Recruitment of yearlings into the population on
   Kalgin Island exhibited a strong density-dependent response. Our
   analysis indicated an extremely high intrinsic rate of increase (r =
   0.35 - 0.44) for those moose. Even with that high productivity, moose on
   Kalgin Island could not withstand the heavy harvest to which they were
   subjected, which exceeded maximum sustained yield during the early years
   to meet initial management objectives. Moose on Kalgin Island exhibited
   a strong density-dependent response to harvest, and we hypothesize that
   density-dependent mechanisms interact with harvest, predation, and
   severe weather to influence other populations of moose in Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1994 and 1997, we surveyed moose hunters in Quebec to assess the
   social impacts of the 1994-1998 moose management plan. The number of
   hunters that stopped hunting and the number of hunting days practiced
   were estimated as indices of hunting activity changes, while hunters'
   opinions about population abundance and the number of moose seen and
   killed per 100 hunting days were monitored as indices of population
   change as perceived by hunters. The number of moose found dead per 100
   hunting days was used to assess the proportion of animals accidentally
   or illegally killed. Knowledge and perception of the regulation were
   measured to evaluate the acceptance of the selective harvest program by
   hunters. Between 3,500 and 7,000 questionnaires were sent each year to
   hunters randomly chosen in 5 hunting zones where different harvesting
   scenarios were applied (limited number of cow permits, no cow harvest
   for 5 years, cows allowed every 2 years, no cows for 2 years and limited
   number of cow permits thereafter, and nonselective harvest) to determine
   their relative efficiency. Over 13\% of the hunters quit hunting each
   year but were replaced by a similar number that started or resumed
   hunting. The number of hunting days per hunter did not vary
   significantly between 1994 and 1997, but 22 - 38\% of the hunters
   indicated they hunted for a longer period in 1994 than in 1993 to
   increase opportunities to harvest a moose under the selective harvest
   program. An increasing number of hunters thought that moose populations
   were growing. The number of moose seen per 100 hunting days and the
   hunting success increased in some hunting zones. In zones where no cow
   harvest was allowed, hunters indicated that a large number of dead moose
   were left in the forest; this figure is likely voluntarily overestimated
   by hunters considering their proportion in relation to the legal
   harvest, the absence of a difference between the sexes of moose that
   were presumably found dead, and the low illegal harvest reported by
   wildlife officers. Hunters correctly understood the regulation of their
   hunting zone, approved its objectives, and still considered that the
   regulation allowed for an enjoyable hunting experience. Overall, hunters
   seemed satisfied with the 1994-1998 management plan despite the
   considerable changes brought about by the selective harvest program.
   This emphasizes the need for their participation in elaborating hunting
   strategies. Among the different hunting scenarios, the harvest of cows
   every 2 years seemed the most acceptable to hunters because it is easy
   to manage (no computer draw) and understand, is fair for all hunters,
   and permits a moderate population increase.}},

   moose (Alces alces americana) were harvested within 5 experimental
   blocks ranging from 539 - 1,257 km(2). Those blocks were located in
   central Quebec between 45 - 150 km north of Trois-Rivieres. A block of
   544 km2 was added to monitor a moose population in the absence of
   hunting. Hunting pressure was unequally distributed within the 5 blocks
   (0.7 - 6 hunting days/km(2)), whereas hunting effort (hunting
   days/capture) ranged from 21 - 115 during the same period. The
   relationship between finite rate of increase (lambda) of moose
   populations, derived from aerial moose counts conducted at the beginning
   and at the end of the study, and hunting pressure, led us to observe
   that the moose population began to decrease when hunting pressure

   without hunting pressure. A negative correlation also existed between
   hunting pressure and the mean age of moose harvested.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle grazing has been shown to alter various features of desert
   communities that may impact microhabitats required by various species of
   desert rodents, with unknown implications for desert rodent communities.
   We conducted a series of studies at heavily and lightly grazed sites to
   investigate effects of cattle grazing on desert rodent relative
   abundances, home range sizes and microhabitat use in salt desert shrub
   communities of the western Great Basin Desert. Monitoring of rodent
   populations with repeated live trapping showed that different levels of
   grazing were associated with differences in relative abundances of some
   species of rodents. Specifically, Dipodomys merriami was significantly
   more abundant in heavily grazed areas, and Perognathus longimembris was
   significantly more abundant in lightly grazed areas. Our studies showed
   that cattle, by preferentially feeding on certain plants, can create
   conditions that are more suitable for some species of rodents, while
   reducing important microhabitat for other species.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of predator removal on predator and mountain hare (Lepus
   timidus) populations was studied in southern, eastern and northern
   Finland in 1993-1998. In predator removal areas predators were
   intensively hunted, and in predator protection areas hunting was
   prohibited. Both predator (red fox Vulpes vulpes, pine marten Martes
   martes, stoat Mustela erminea and raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides)
   and mountain hare populations were monitored in the study areas. Fox and
   marten populations were affected by predator removal/protection in
   eastern and northern Finland but the effect was not as evident in
   southern Finland. The stoat population was not affected by removal, but
   the raccoon dog population was to some extent. Trends in hare
   populations were similar in the removal and protection areas, indicating
   that localized control/protection of predators did not affect hare
   numbers. Hare population even increased in the protection area of
   northern Finland although predator numbers increased and vole numbers
   declined.}},

Journal = {{ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{257-289}},
Abstract = {{Baculoviruses, among other insect viruses, are regarded as safe and
   selective bioinsecticides, restricted to invertebrates. They have been
   used worldwide against many insect pests, mainly Lepidoptera. Their
   application as microbial pesticides, however, has not met their
   potential to control pests in crops, forests, and pastures, with the
   exception of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus of the soybean caterpillar
   (Anticarsia gemmatalis), which is used on approximately 1 million ha
   annually in Brazil. Problems that have limited expansion of baculovirus
   use include narrow host range, slow killing speed, technical and
   economical difficulties for in vitro commercial production, timing of
   application based on frequent host population monitoring, variability of
   field efficacy due to climatic conditions, and farmers' attitudes toward
   pest control, which have been based on application of fast-killing
   chemical insecticides. Farmer education regarding use of biological
   insecticides and their characteristics is considered one of the major
   actions necessary for increased use of baculoviruses. Strategies to
   counteract Some of the limitations of baculoviruses, especially their
   slow killing activity, have been investigated and are promising. These
   include the use of chemical or biological substances added to virus
   formulations and genetic engineering of the viruses themselves to
   express insect toxins or hormones. Such strategies can enhance viral
   activity and increase speed of kill as well as reduce larval feeding
   activity. The use of baculoviruses against Lepidoptera is reviewed, with
   the utilization of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus of A. gemmatalis in
   Brazil serving as a case-study.}},

Abstract = {{1. In the Maldives, coral mining for the: construction industry has
   resulted in widespread degradation of shallow reef-flat areas. Due to
   the loss of these coastal resources and the associated problems of
   coastal erosion, there is an urgent need to find practical methods for
   rehabilitating mined reefs.
   2. The slow rates of natural recovery of mined reefs has prompted
   interest in the potential of artificial reef structures to rehabilitate
   these degraded habitats. An experimental artificial reef programme was
   initiated in 1990 to discover whether it is feasible to use a
   bio-engineering approach to kick-start natural reef recovery.
   3. The main goals of the project were to restore the capacity of
   degraded reefs for sea defence and their ability to harbour fish
   species. Accordingly, 360 t of concrete structures of varying levels of
   topographic complexity, stabilising effect and cost were deployed on a
   heavily mined study site close to the capital island, Male.
   4. Within 1 year of deployment, the artificial reef structures had
   similar or greater species richness and densities of reef fish than did
   control pristine reef flats. However, the community structure of the
   fish populations on the artificial reef structures was significantly
   different to that on unmined reef flats.
   5. Preliminary results of a monitoring programme indicated that
   substantial coral recruitment had occurred on the larger reef structures
   which were each supporting ca. 500 colonies, some of which were
   approaching 25 cm in diameter after 3.5 years. An evaluation of the
   effectiveness of the various artificial reef structures is discussed in
   relation to their design features and costs and in line with timescales
   for the recovery processes. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Manila clam (Tapes philippinarum) culture and sediment interactions were
   tested by comparing two rearing areas, including an oceanic
   ('Le-Ferret') and a more estuarine ('Les-Jacquets') sites in the bay of
   Arcachon (France). The growth of a calibrated clam population (10-mm
   spat) was monitored in these two areas with a concomitant sediment-water
   interface survey over a 1.5-year period. Two sites per area, including
   control and rearing plots, were sampled on a monthly basis. The
   potential clam farming impacts by bioturbation and interactions were
   examined at three sediment depths: 0-1, 1-2 and 2-10 cm. Moreover, the
   main hydrobiological parameters were measured on a weekly basis to
   establish a relationship between these parameters and sediment-water
   interface characteristics. The existence of a gradient between the three
   depths was revealed for most of the parameters examined, with the
   exception of silt and organic carbon levels, and this regardless of the
   area examined. Clam growth showed a rate improvement in the oceanic
   area, which is characterized by a lower silt content. The clam effect
   was minimal and the activity identified at the `Ferret' site was in fact
   due to the presence of a net which acted as a particle trap. No
   significant relationship was established between water column parameters
   and those of the sediment-water interface at the two geographical sites
   examined. These results demonstrate that clam rearing had only a limited
   effect on the environmental sediment parameters (i.e. water percentage,
   and phaeopigments and silt levels) from a spatio-temporal point of view.
   Therefore, a return to environmental conditions existing before the
   implementation of clam farming is likely to occur upon cessation of this
   activity. (C) Ifremer/Elsevier, Paris.}},

   Ardea purpurea in Mediterranean France}},
Journal = {{ARDEA}},

Abstract = {{The breeding population of Purple Heron Ardea purpurea in Mediterranean
   France showed a general decline since 1982 with a further reduction in
   number of breeding pairs in the early 1990s that has been reversed since
   1995. In addition to this general decline, the population showed large
   annual fluctuations in size. We studied colony dynamics to determine
   which type of colony contributes most to the annual variation in total
   population size. Almost all (98\%) annual variation in population size
   could be explained by the number and size of occupied colonies in three
   clusters with discrete dynamics, a cluster of large and stable colonies,
   one of intermediate-sized unstable colonies and a rest cluster of
   non-specified colonies. In general, colonies had high turnover rates and
   were very variable in size from year to year. Large colonies of stable
   presence played a pivotal role in the total population size. However,
   the hypothesis that when some local ecological factor caused a large
   site to be unavailable groups of birds moved to other, smaller and less
   reliable sites was not supported. An alternative hypothesis of a
   regionally operating factor affecting all sites similarly was rejected
   by the observation that the number and size of occupied colonies in the
   stable cluster was neither positively nor negatively related to any
   other cluster. We surmise that the high variability in colony size in
   the study population was a result of a combination of various local
   scale ecological factors, probably related to the inundation state of
   the individual colony sites, and determined the large fluctuations in
   population size. It remains to be established by demographic studies
   whether the total French Mediterranean population, thus including
   non-breeding birds, fluctuates along with the local possibilities for
   breeding, or whether it remains largely unaffected by local breeding
   conditions.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{129-140}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fog was sampled at four locations in California's San Joaquin Valley
   (SJV) during December 1995 and January 1996 as part of the 1995
   Integrated Monitoring Study (IMS95). The fog sampling campaign was
   conducted in two phases. During the first phase, fog was sampled at
   three southern SJV surface locations, two urban (Fresno and Bakersfield)
   and one rural (near the Kern Wildlife Refuge). Both bulk samples
   (representative of the entire fog drop spectrum) and size-fractionated
   samples were collected. During the second phase, bulk fog samples were
   collected at three elevations on a 430 m television transmission tower
   in the northern SJV, representing some of the first observations of
   vertical variations in fog composition. SJV fog was observed to be
   consistently alkaline. The median pH measured in the southern SJV was
   6.49, with a range from 4.97 to 7.43. Dominant species in the fog water
   were ammonium (median southern SJV concentration of 1008
   microequivalents/l (mu N)), nitrate (483 mu N), sulfate (117 mu N),
   acetate (117 mu N), formate (63 mu N), and formaldehyde (46 mu M).
   Concentrations of the inorganic ions were similar in the urban and rural
   fogs, although occasionally much higher spikes of S(IV) and sulfate were
   observed in Bakersfield fog. Acetate, formaldehyde, and total organic
   carbon, by contrast, were observed to be present in greater
   concentration in the urban fogs. Bakersfield IMS95 fog concentrations of
   most species were similar to those measured there in the early 1980s,
   although concentrations of S(IV) and sulfate were much lower in IMS95
   fogs. Significant differences were found between the composition of
   large and small fog drops, with pH differences at times exceeding one pH
   unit. The chemical heterogeneity present among SJV fog drop populations
   is likely to result in significant enhancement of aqueous sulfate
   production rates over those expected from average fog properties.
   Significant vertical variations were also observed in fog composition.
   Liquid water content was observed to increase strongly with elevation,
   while major ion aqueous concentrations in fog drops decreased with
   altitude. The total amount of solute contained within the fog (per unit
   volume of air) was observed to increase with altitude. These
   observations form a unique data set to be used for model evaluation and
   for further analysis of aerosol processing by fogs. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Journal = {{AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{4-10}},
Abstract = {{Disease suppressiveness can be viewed as one of the characteristics of a
   healthy soil. From an ecological point of view, soil health implies
   ecosystem stability, diversity, functional connectedness, and resilience
   in response to a disturbance or stress; Disease suppression can be
   Viewed as a manifestation of ecosystem stability and health. Previously
   suggested indicators for soil health and disease suppression have mainly
   been lists of variables that were correlated to more or less disturbed
   soils (ranging from conventional and organic agricultural soils, to
   grassland and forest soils) or to root disease conduciveness. We suggest
   that indicators for soil health and disease suppression could be found
   by monitoring responses of the soil microbial community and nutrient
   availability to the application of a disturbance or stress. This
   approach is illustrated by wave-like responses of microbial communities,
   soluble carbon and nitrogen, and damping-off by Pythium spp. after
   incorporation of a cover crop in soil. The amplitudes of the waves were
   mostly wider when cover crop debris was incorporated in fallow soil than
   in cover cropped soil. Pythium damping-off was less severe in
   cover-cropped soil. These results suggest that the proposed approach to
   the search for indicators of soil health and disease suppression, namely
   measuring the amplitude of fluctuations in microbial populations and
   resilience to a disturbance or stress, is promising.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in government and international policy, coupled with
   consideration of sustainable management strategies, will lead to the
   demise of methyl bromide as a soil disinfestation treatment for high
   value cropping industries within the next decade. Methyl bromide has
   provided excellent disease, pest and weed seed control and finding
   alternative chemical and non-chemical options which replace all the
   benefits of methyl bromide is providing a challenge to researchers. The
   advantages and disadvantages of alternative chemical and non-chemical
   control strategies are considered in this paper. Alternative chemicals
   treatments showing promise include lower application doses of methyl
   bromide, such as methyl bromide/chloropicrin (30:70) and the use of
   other fumigant mixtures such as, 1,3-Dichloropropene/chloropicron and
   metham sodium combined with chloropicron. Investigations in Victoria
   have led to the development of an integrated pest management (IPM)
   strategy which partially offsets the need for methyl bromide in the
   flower bulb industry. IPM systems, however, will require more input from
   farmers, and support services, in such areas as the monitoring of pest
   and disease populations and the use of disease resistant stock and
   disease-free nursery material, before IPM systems fully offset the
   benefits of methyl bromide. Consideration of grower profits, reliability
   and insurance afforded by soil disinfestation with methyl bromide must
   be taken into account when assessing the suitability of alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{A simple, inexpensive chamber was developed and tested as an evaluative
   tool to monitor Trichogramma cordubensis dispersal in the laboratory.
   The chamber consisted of a continuous, winding channel which was cut
   into an aluminum block. Wasps were released at one end of the channel
   and allowed to walk in the channel for 21 h and to parasitize Mamestra
   brassicae eggs placed 3.4 m from the point of wasp introduction.
   Comparisons between two T. cordubensis populations demonstrated that one
   population (TCM) dispersed more in the chamber and located host eggs
   more successfully than the other population (TCD). Subsequent greenhouse
   releases confirmed that the TCM population dispersed more readily and
   had significantly higher parasitism rates on sentinel Ephestia
   kuehniella eggs on tomato plants. The potential utilization of this
   chamber as a tool to evaluate quality of Trichogramma populations,
   mainly dispersal activity, is discussed.}},

Title = {{Classical biological control in an ephemeral crop habitat with
   Anticarsia gemmatalis nucleopolyhedrovirus}},
Journal = {{BIOCONTROL}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{403-419}},
Abstract = {{Anticarsia gemmatalis nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgNPV) was released as a
   single spray in soybean at two sites in Louisiana, near Crowley and
   Baton Rouge, after which viral prevalence and population density were
   monitored for 3-4 years. Each site had a plot with no treatment
   (control) and two virus-treated plots, one planted with soybean yearly
   for 3-4 years, and the other planted with soybean for 3-4 years except
   for rotation to a different crop in year 2. In year 1, the single spray
   of AgNPV resulted in viral prevalence rates ranging from 25-100\% A.
   gemmatalis mortality over the entire growing season. By the end of this
   season, viral accumulation in soil averaged 4.1 x 10(4) occlusion bodies
   (OB)/g at Crowley and 7.4 x 10(3) OB/g at Baton Rouge, which had a
   sandier soil than Crowley. At Crowley, prevalence of AgNPV reached 49\%
   insect mortality in the unrotated plot in year 2, and 31\% in the
   rotated plot and 38\% in the unrotated plot in year 3, in spite of
   moderate to low population densities of A. gemmatalis. At Baton Rouge,
   AgNPV prevalence decreased to peak prevalence rates of 25\% insect
   mortality in year 2, 4\% in year 3, and 11\% in year 4, even though A.
   gemmatalis population densities were moderate in years 2 and 3. Viral
   concentration in soil decreased to 2.7 x 10(2) OB/g (rotated plot) and
   1.4 x 10(4) OB/g (unrotated plot) by the end of year 3 at Crowley and to
   10 OB/g (rotated plot) and 31 OB/g (unrotated plot) by the end of year 4
   at Baton Rouge. In forward stepwise multiple regressions, the
   concentration of OB in soil was significantly (p = 0.0001) and
   positively correlated with AgNPV prevalence, but correlations of the
   latter parameter with host population density and rainfall were not
   significant (p > 0.05). Prevalence rates of the fungal entomopathogen
   Nomuraea rileyi were significantly (p < 0.01) and negatively correlated
   with AgNPV prevalence at Crowley but not in the combined data set.
   Prevalence of N. rileyi was negatively correlated (p = 0.0001) with
   precipitation and positively correlated (p = 0.0001) with A. gemmatalis
   population density. The research demonstrated that AgNPV can be
   introduced and established for long-term suppression of A. gemmatalis in
   an ephemeral crop habitat, but certain site-related conditions, perhaps
   relating to soil, are necessary for its continued success.}},

Abstract = {{Settling and growth of the Asian freshwater mussel Limnoperna fortunei
   on experimental PVC frames in the Parana de las Palmas river, ca 130 km
   north of Buenos Aires was monitored at monthly intervals in 1998. Frames
   were deployed in January. In February and March colonization reached
   38000-44000 mussels m(-2) with early juveniles (< 2 mm) accounting for
   over 98\% of the population. in April through August the total densities
   decreased to 9000-2000 individuals m(-2), the populations being
   dominated by older (> 2 mm) mussels. In September through December
   densities grew steadily again, with early juveniles (< 2 mm) accounting
   for over 95\% of the mussels recorded. During their first month, animals
   born in January grew to ca 3-4 mm in length; in March they reached 7-8
   mm, and by mid April 11-12 mm. In late April through July the growth
   rate decreased to < 2 mm per month, and in August it stopped almost
   completely, resuming again in late September. During the first year
   animals born in January reached 20 mm in length; by the end of the
   second year the estimated length was 30 mm, with a maximum theoretical
   length of 35 mm being reached after 3 years. The data agree with the
   reported population dynamics of L. fortunei in Hong Kong in that both
   populations are characterized by extended reproduction periods lasting
   ca 9 months, and that the spring onset of breeding is triggered by a
   rise in temperature above approximately 16-17 degrees C. On the other
   hand, in the Parana river reproduction was found to be continuous
   between September and March, and the period of lowest yearly
   temperatures was characterized by a very strong breeding decline,
   whereas for the Chinese populations 2-3 yearly spatfalls and breeding
   pulses roughly coinciding with the lowest and highest water temperatures
   were described.}},

Abstract = {{Bioheap leaching of secondary copper ores is applied commercially at
   operations in Chile and Australia. Bioheap leaching of sulfidic
   refractory gold ores has been demonstrated at large scale. There is
   limited comprehension of what actually occurs microbiologically in
   full-scale bioheap operations, despite the commercial achievement of
   copper ore bioheap leaching and the anticipated technical and commercial
   success of gold ore bioheap leaching. Copper bioheaps are typically
   inoculated with the bacteria contained in the raffinate, whereas,
   sulfidic refractory gold ore bioheaps can be inoculated with bacteria
   developed in a separate reactor. Chemical and physical conditions within
   bioheaps change radically from the time the bioheap is stacked and
   inoculated until bioleaching is completed. Redox, acidity, temperature,
   oxygen and solution chemistry conditions can vary widely during the
   oxidation period. Such conditions likely select for microorganisms or
   may, in fact, effect a succession of organisms in portions of the
   bioheap. Bioheap solutions are recycled and constituent build-up over
   time also affects the microbiology. Heterotrophic microorganisms may
   also play some role in bioheap leaching. Understanding the microbiology
   of bioheaps is key to advancing commercial bioheap applications. Such
   knowledge will increase the ore types as well as the diversity of
   mineral deposits that can be processed by bioheap technology. It will
   also enable better control of conditions to improve leach rates, metal
   recoveries and costs. This paper briefly explains commercial practices,
   describes chemical, physical and microbiological monitoring of bioheap,
   considers conditions that control microbial populations in bioheaps, and
   examines the types of ore deposits that could be bioleached, if the
   microbiology was elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{The beneficiation of mineral substances through biotechnology forms the
   objective and basis of the present study of the pyrite bacterial
   leaching (bioleaching) process. The use of ferrous and sulfide oxidizing
   bacteria in bioleaching processes is a recent technique that has found
   industrial applications in copper, uranium, cobalt and gold extraction.
   To pursue its application and extend it to the upgrading of other ores,
   its technical and economic viability must be continually demonstrated
   and optimized, through credible technological innovations in terms of
   scale-up and better control of biochemical activity. This is what this
   work aims to achieve by improving the knowledge of the intimate
   mechanisms governing the action of microorganisms.
   The substrate used is formed of finely ground pyrite. The cultures are
   batch-prepared and kept at a temperature of 35 degrees C, agitated and
   aerated. The bacterial population used comprises three species
   (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Thiobacillus thiooxidans and Leptospirillum
   ferrooxidans). Specific equipment was developed and adapted for the
   study, including the design of special pyrite electrodes and the use of
   electrochemical methods for corrosion and interface investigations.
   These tools served to identify and monitor the electrochemical reactions
   occurring during bioleaching, both in solution and on the surface of the
   pyrite electrodes. The overall chemical process of pyrite bioleaching
   was determined and subdivided into distinct elementary stages. The key
   factors of each elementary stage and their respective roles were
   identified. This made possible, for each stage, to differentiate the
   electrochemical reactions occurring in solution and at the interfaces,
   which, when combined, leaded to overall reactions that advance the
   bacterial leaching of pyrite.
   These results completely contradict the theory of direct dissolution of
   the pyrite by the bacteria and indicate that: i) the ferric ion hence
   remains the only powerful oxidant of pyrite during its bacterial
   leaching, ii) the only role of the bacteria is (re)generation of ferric
   ions in solution and iii) the process of bacterial adhesion or contact
   or attack no longer has the same meaning as it was hitherto attributed.}},

Abstract = {{Tamboraque is the first industrial BIOX(R) plant in Peru. This plant is
   located in the Department of Lima at 3,000 m, above sea level and will
   allow to recover gold and silver through biooxidation from arsenopyrite
   concentrate. This concentrate of arsenopyrite is coming from zinc
   flotation tailings accumulated by years from older metallurgical
   campaigns.
   This concentrate is highly refractory with a gold recovery by direct
   cyanidation of only 10\%. Tamboraque concentrate grade is 25 gr/ton of
   gold, 57 gr/ton of silver, 30\% sulphide sulphur, 32\% total iron, and
   22\% of arsenic.
   Series of batch tests have been carried out during between 7 to 10 days
   in 10, 100 and 1000 litres bioreactors. The use of acid mine drainage
   during the preparation of 10\% w/v slurry increased the ferric iron
   content, reduced the initial consumption of sulphuric acid and also
   reduced the need of a direct treatment of this acid mine drainage before
   discharging into the Rimac river. Regrinding of the concentrate was 85\%
   -325 mesh. The major control parameters during these tests were:
   temperature at 38-40 degrees C, 2-5 ppm of dissolved oxygen
   concentration, and pH between 1.6-1.3. The process was monitored daily
   by checking the ferrous, ferric and arsenic concentrations, bacterial
   population in the leaching solution, dissolved oxygen levels and the
   REDOX potential in the slurry.
   After biooxidation treatment, removal of arsenic, iron and sulphur were
   96\%, 94\% and 90\% respectively. Cyanidation of this biooxidized
   product reached 92\% gold recovery. This preliminary study indicated the
   technical feasibility of biooxidation treatment for this arsenopyrite
   concentrate with high content of arsenic at 3,000 m. above sea level.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial consortia composed of complex mixtures of autotrophic and
   heterotrophic bacteria are responsible for the dissolution of metals
   from sulfide minerals. Thus, an efficient copper bioleaching operation
   depends on the microbial ecology of the system. A microbial ecology
   study of a mixed oxide/sulfide copper leaching operation was conducted
   using an ``overlay{''} plating technique to differentiate and identify
   various bacterial consortium members of the genera Thiobacillus,
   ``Leptospirillum{''}: ``Ferromicrobium{''}, and Acidiphilium. Two
   temperatures (30 degrees C and 45 degrees C) were used to select for
   mesophilic and moderately thermophilic bacteria. Cell numbers varied
   from 0-10(6) cells/g dry ore, depending on the sample location and
   depth. After acid curing for oxide leaching, no viable bacteria were
   recovered, although inoculation of cells from raffinate re-established a
   microbial population after three months. Due to low the pH of the
   operation, very few non-iron-oxidizing acidophilic heterotrophs were
   recovered. Moderate thermophiles were isolated from the ore samples.
   Pregnant liquor solutions (PLS) and raffinate both contained a diversity
   of bacteria. In addition, an intermittently applied waste stream that
   contained high levels of arsenic and fluoride was tested for toxicity.
   Twenty vol\% waste stream in PLS killed 100\% of the cells in 48 hours,
   indicating substantial toxicity and/or growth inhibition. The data
   indicate that bacteria populations can recover after acid curing, and
   that application of the waste stream to the dump should be avoided.
   Monitoring the microbial ecology of the leaching operation provided
   significant information that improved copper recovery.}},

   PCR protocols and amplification conditions were developed using
   prokaryotic universal primers that amplify whole community 16S ribosomal

Abstract = {{In continuing and new research efforts, we are examining marine
   environmental constraints and attempting to quantify the factors that
   limit or accelerate the rate of natural attenuation of polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in contaminated marine sediments. Most
   previous research in bioremediation has been directed toward terrestrial
   sites. We are fortunate to enjoy collaborations with Hart Crowser, a
   contractor evaluating alternative remediation designs, and the National
   Marine Fisheries (NOAA). In these collaborations, we examine some of the
   research questions raised by the ongoing monitoring of a
   partially-capped, approximately 50-acre submerged Superfund Site in
   Puget Sound, marine habitat to fish important to the regional economy.
   This paper presents some conceptual models and experimental results
   regarding PAH mineralization, using a sensitive radioisotopic method to
   monitor the evolution of CO2 from labelled target compounds, in the
   undisturbed upper similar to 10 cm of marine sediment. We are addressing
   target compound mineralization by natural microbial populations. In
   addressing contaminant sorption and bioavailability, we focus on the
   potential for microorganism to influence bioavailability using
   extracellular enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate potential biases in productivity indices and
   survival-rate estimates from four years(1992-95) of data from the
   Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) Programme, we
   examined correlations and regressions of trends in adult captures on
   population changes modelled from productivity indices and survival-rate
   estimates for target species at both local and regional scales. We
   estimated trends in adult captures from regressions of drain indices on
   year. We calculated mean numbers of young per adult, and estimated
   time-constant, annual adult survival rates from mark-recapture data
   using both non-transient and transient models. We used these
   productivity indices and survival-rate estimates in a simple demographic
   model to calculate predicted rates of population change. We modelled
   survival of young birds (phi(y); from initial capture, generally during
   juvenile dispersal, to recruitment into the following year's breeding
   population) relative to adults (phi(a)) as phi(y) = 0.75 x phi(a). At
   the local scale, correlation coefficients between trends in adult
   captures and modelled population changes tended to be positive, but the
   strengths of the correlations were often weak. As expected, trends in
   adult captures generally were better correlated with modelled population
   changes than with either productivity or survival. Stronger correlations
   between trends in adult captures and modelled population changes tended
   to be found using survival estimates from the non-transient model, but
   modelled population changes using the transient model gave values for
   mean population changes closest to those derived from trends in adult
   captures. Modelled population changes sometimes were less well
   correlated with trends in adult captures at the regional than at the
   local scale, presumably because of spatial heterogeneity in the factors
   affecting population dynamics of target species. These results suggest
   that absolute measures of productivity derived from MAPS are likely to
   be biased, but do not show unequivocally the extent to which such biases
   might differ between species. Nevertheless, given the relatively low
   precision of analyses based an only a few years of data, these results
   suggest that relative measures of productivity and survival derived from
   MAPS do reflect observed population changes. Longer runs of data should
   allow the demographic mechanisms causing population changes to be
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{We estimated survival rates of Swainson's Thrush, a common neotropical,
   migratory landbird, at multiple spatial scales, using data collected in
   the western LISA from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship
   Programme. We evaluated statistical power to detect spatially
   heterogeneous survival rates and exponentially declining survival rates
   among spatial scales with simulated populations parameterized from
   results of the Swainson's Thrush analyses. Models describing survival
   rates as constant across large spatial scales did not fit the data. The
   model toe chose as most appropriate to describe survival rates of
   Swainson's Thrush allowed survival rates to vary among Physiographic
   Provinces, included a separate parameter for the probability that a
   newly captured bird is a resident individual in the study population,
   and constrained capture probability to be constant across all stations.
   Estimated annual survival rates under this model varied from 0.42 to
   0.75 among Provinces. The coefficient of variation of survival estimates
   ranged fi om 5.8 to 20\% among Physiographic Provinces. Statistical
   power to detect exponentially declining trends was fairly low for small
   spatial scales, although large annual declines (3\% of previous year's
   rate) were likely to be detected when monitoring was conducted for long
   periods of time (e.g. 20 years). Although our simulations and field
   results are based an only four years of data from a limited number and
   distribution of stations, it is likely that they illustrate genuine
   difficulties inherent to broadscale efforts to monitor survival rates of
   territorial landbirds. In particular our results suggest that more
   attention needs to be paid to sampling schemes of monitoring programmes,
   particularly regarding the trade-off between precision and potential
   bias of parameter estimates at varying spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{Developing cost effective methods for monitoring vertebrate populations
   is a persistent problem in wildlife biology. Population demographic data
   is too costly and time intensive to acquire, so researchers have begun
   investigating presence/absence sampling as a means for monitoring
   wildlife populations. We examined three important assumptions regarding
   the probability of detection (POD) requisite to implementing presence!
   absence sampling for wildlife monitoring: constant POD within species
   among sampling visits, among years, and among habitats. POD was constant
   for all small mammals examined between habitats and for most small
   mammals among visits and between years. Presence/absence may eventually
   serve as an effective means of monitoring some wildlife populations for
   demographic changes over time, but additional research will be necessary
   to further test these and other assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with a population of Undaria pinnatifida (Harvey)
   Suringar, established in the coastal area around St Male. In another
   study, during a monthly monitoring program, growth rate was estimated.
   Simultaneous morphological observations permitted the identification of
   two morphs, one resembling f. typica and the other f: distans.
   Anatomical characters of the two morphs are the same. The punched-holes
   method and the induced bifurcation of thalli permitted estimation of the
   contribution of the stipo-frondal region to overall growth. The
   structure of the midrib, pinnules and sporophylls are described and new
   data are given about the formation of Yendo cells. These latter serve as
   an early distinctive character between Undaria pinnatifida acid
   Saccorhiza polyschides (Lightfoot) Batters which does not possess such
   cells. This criterion was used to identify juvenile blades in the study
   of monthly recruitment. Thallus morphology and bifurcation are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of the deliberate introduction of Undaria pinnatifida
   (Harvey) Suringar into the Rance Estuary for aquaculture purposes, this
   kelp has now established itself naturally in the coastal area around St
   Male. A population of U. pinnatifida in the Dinard area was subjected to
   a monthly monitoring programme, conducted in the lower eulittoral zone
   during low water of Spring tides. Tagging of thalli and punching: of
   holes on the blades were methods used to estimate growth rate. Five
   parameters were measured: total length, stipe length, midrib width,
   sporophyll number and sporophyll width. During the 20 months of this
   study, 4 series of thalli (two per year) developed successively, in
   spring and autumn. Thalli appeared throughout the year, although very
   few were present during a period of three weeks, from the end of August
   to mid-September. Maximal daily growth rates occurred in March-April (21
   mm/day) for spring thalli appearing from January to March, and in
   November (18 mm/day) for those appearing in October. The highest growth
   rate was observed both in the spring rise and autumnal fall of
   temperature and illumination. Thalli that appeared in autumn and winter
   produced the widest sporophylls. Thalli that appeared in spring and
   early summer gave rise to sporophylls less wide but more numerous. The
   maximal life-span noted in the field was 222 days (about 7.5 months);
   but most had a life-span of about 6 months. Maximal size observed was
   1.90 m, with 1.470 g wet weight and 190 g dry weight.}},

Abstract = {{Some aspects of the life cycle of the ascidian Phallusia nigra at Sao
   Sebastiao (southern Brazil) were studied and compared with its life
   history traits studied at Jamaica. Population dynamics was monitored on
   natural substrates sampled on a monthly basis. Longevity, recruitment
   and mortality rates were obtained by monitoring permanent quadrats. The
   breeding period was assessed by dissection of animals and searching for
   full gonoducts. P. nigra adults are 5-8 cm long and are distributed
   mostly on vertical and inclined surfaces. Recruits are found throughout
   the year, but a marked peak of abundance was observed during the fall
   (April to June). Adults had full gonoducts during summer (November to
   February). High mortality was observed during the first 3 mo after
   juveniles were observed the first time. Most animals died before the
   first year of life, but a few would persist for at least 2 yrs. Some
   life history traits of the Brazilian population, such as timing of
   reproduction and the number of recruitment peaks per year, are similar
   to those shown by the Caribbean population. On the other hand, size of
   adults, mean longevity and abundance of recruits were all lower in the
   Brazilian animals.}},

Abstract = {{Flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris were stocked in 1990 and 1994 in a
   31 ha Virginia impoundment to control stunted and undesirable fish

   harvest decreased from 2,285 in 1992 to 25 in 1998. Average weight of
   harvested brown bullheads increased (r(2) = 0.94; P < 0.0001) as
   population numbers declined. Brown bullheads harvested in 1998 averaged
   761 g; whereas, those harvested before flathead catfish introduction
   rarely exceeded 150 g. Brown bullhead catch in gill nets followed a
   similar trend from 1993 through 1998, and average weight increased (r(2)
   = 0.86; P = 0.024); whereas, catch declined significantly (r(2) = 0.73;

Abstract = {{Here, we present data derived from a long-term health monitoring (from
   1976 to 1996) of groups of people affected by the fallout of TCDD over
   Seveso and the nearby area which occurred on July 10, 1976. These data
   present advantages in that: (1) they were derived from individuals of
   both sexes covering all age ranges; and (2) since then serum samples
   have been kept frozen and we have been recently able to measure (at CDC,
   Atlanta, USA) the TCDD blood lipid content. We can therefore correlate
   exposure with health effects during the years and the lever of pollution
   in the soil which gave rise to zones A, B and R - zone A. being the most
   polluted. The results indicate that:
   1 serum TCDD levels in residents of zone A. showed a much elevated
   exposure (up to 56,000 ppt) than in zone B;
   2 chloracne was the only clinical alteration positively correlated to
   TCDD contamination levels, even if not completely, and with differing
   individual susceptibility;
   3 miscarriages, perinatal mortality, low birthweight or congenital
   malformations did not significantly increase;
   4 clinical monitoring of children and adults did not prove any clear
   association between morbidity (except chloracne) and TCDD exposure;
   5 laboratory results showed minimal differences between exposed (even if
   hugely exposed) and controls in the period of acute exposure (1976-1977)
   with relation to liver function tests, complement haemolytic activity,
   white blood cells, lymphocytes and haemoglobin. These differences were
   subclinical, faded and then disappeared with time.
   Part of the exposed people were controlled in 1992-1996 and the results
   showed that:
   1 no laboratory pathology was related to TCDD levels in both the acute
   and chronic phase;
   2 cytochrome P450 IA2 did seem to be induced after about 17 years in
   exposed people compared to controls as measured by the Caffein Breath
   Test;
   3 the half-life of TCDD was longer in women (about 9 years) than in men
   (about 7.5 years), while in children it is much shorter.
   A check of people born after 1976 from exposed parents was recently
   started. In zone A, from 9 months after the accident (April 1977) to
   December 1984, corresponding to about one TCDD half-life in adults,
   there was a significant modification of the sex ratio with an excess of
   females (26M vs 48F) associated with high TCDD exposure of both parents.
   This fact later declined (60M vs 64F) and is no longer significant.
   These results, never reported before in any other TCDD exposed group of
   people, suggest the need to continue following-up the population in
   order to monitor their health and better understand the TCDD mode of
   action as well as the individual susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{The Bosco delle Querce is located 20 km from Milan, between the towns of
   Seveso and Meda, in the area which suffered from the highest
   concentration of dioxin. The 43 ha have undergone a complex project of
   landscape reconstruction and returned to the local population 20 years
   after the accident. In 1985, 5,000 trees and 6,000 bushes of local
   species were planted. The Seveso Special Bureaux was closed the
   following year and the area was entrusted to the Forests Regional Agency
   under the co-ordination of the Parks and Natural Environmental
   Department of the Lombardy Regional Council. Activities began by
   organizing a team of local workers, who in the first 10 years have
   accumulated 7,613 days worked. At the same time, 4,332,000,000 liras was
   spent on: completing the project; creating five natural areas; extensive
   reforestation; setting up a second generation of thousands of trees;
   restructuring buildings; purchasing adequate vehicles; monitoring in
   co-ordination with public bodies, universities, local institutes and
   associations; creating green barriers; planning and implementing
   landscape interventions in the neighbourhood; creating new cartography;
   and performing accurate daily maintenance. Twelve years after
   desertification, the Bosco delle Querce has become a significantly
   developed ecosystem for fauna and vegetation, and herons and foxes. The
   landscape appears pleasant and diversified, alternating between wild
   wooded areas of different colours, meadows and gardens. In 1994, the
   Bosco delle Querce was divided into areas, each identified with a
   specific function at regional and local level, both to remember the
   accident and to prove its overcoming:
   1 Landscape and green barrier (5 ha);
   2 Naturalistic area (17 ha);
   3 Playground and leisure area (7 ha);
   4 Natural recreational aspects (9 ha);
   5 Preservation of technological plants (5 ha).
   Since 1987, various initiatives have been undertaken in order to connect
   the park to the local population. The institutions involved intend to
   develop attractions compatible with the ecosystem and to open the park
   for regulated access, expand the wooded area and involve the local
   population and associations in the area management.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of native and alien crayfish inhabiting the British
   Isles is described separately for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern
   Ireland, Irish Republic, and some associated islands. Distribution of
   the single native species, Austropotamobius pallipes, is largely
   determined by geology, water quality and human intervention. Very large
   populations exist in England, Wales, and the Irish Republic, but in
   recent years some of these have been eliminated, particularly by
   crayfish plague in the 1980s. Active measures are being taken to
   conserve the remaining stocks of this species in line with the terms of
   the Rio Convention and European Directives. Since the 1970s, a number of
   alien crayfish have been introduced into England, Wales, and Scotland.
   Pacifastacus leniusculus is cultivated in a number of extensive and
   semi-intensive facilities. Astacus leptodactylus is not cultivated to
   any extent but those caught from the wild are used for culinary
   purposes. Large populations of both species now exist in the wild as a
   result of escapes and implants, particularly in central and southern
   England. The wild harvest of these two species is now probably greater
   than that derived from cultivation. Other alien crayfish such as Astacus
   astacus, Procambarus clarkii, and Orconectes limosus are also present in
   the wild in England, and Cherax quadricarinatus is kept by aquarists.
   Due to the environmental impact that wild populations of alien crayfish
   are having in Great Britain, stringent legislation has recently been
   introduced to try and stem their spread and that of crayfish plague.
   Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic ban the import of alien
   crayfish, although Great Britain does not. Reintroduction programs for
   A. pallipes are being initiated and monitoring of populations of both
   native and alien crayfish are being carried out at national and local
   level.}},

Abstract = {{Wild populations of crayfish in Europe include five native species and
   four species introduced from North America. Three of the native species
   are considered as `vulnerable' in the IUCN Red List of Threatened
   Animals. Prospects for the future of crayfish in Europe appear
   different, depending on which crayfish group one considers. For the
   alien species the situation is good as they steadily increase their
   distribution, whilst for the native species the situation in general is
   very bad. The alien species are competitive superior and also carry the
   crayfish plague which kills the European species. This paper looks at
   the future from the native species point of view and focuses on
   necessary management actions and measures. Actions include: restore
   aquatic habitats, determine and monitor crayfish distribution and
   abundance, establish `Native Crayfish Areas', secure fulfilment of
   national crayfish protection aims in different management authorities
   and levels, and prevent spread of alien crayfish. The spread of alien
   crayfish is the main threat to the native, European crayfish. The
   different actions are discussed and elucidated with a number of
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworm species diversity, population density, biomass, age-structure,
   average individual weight, and pattern of distribution were studied in
   the agricultural landscape of two adjacent villages in Qianjiang
   Municipality located on the Jiang-Han plain, Hubei Province, China. We
   identified 16 earthworm species belonging to three families
   (Moniligastridae, Megascolecidae, and Lumbricidae). Among these,
   Amynthas hupeiensis and Metaphire guillelmi were the dominant species,
   and were recorded in significant numbers in different seasons and in the
   various land-use systems studied.
   The highest earthworm population density was found in June, before the
   hot summer, and averaged 23 ind. m(-2), with a maximum of 239 ind.
   m(-2). Among the nine land-use systems distributed in the landscape,
   home gardens, intensively cropped commercial vegetable fields and their
   margins with weeds and bushes generally showed a higher earthworm
   population density, species diversity, and biomass compared with the
   other systems. These observations confirm the importance of an
   heterogeneous agricultural landscape in preserving earthworm abundance
   and diversity and the possibility to use this group as a possible tool
   for monitoring landscape changes and sustainability of agricultural
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to show the possibilities of using the
   characteristics of the bioluminescent fields to monitor the marine
   planktonic communities. The data bank contains 3500 vertical casts of
   bioluminescent potential and near 1000 planktonic organisms obtained at
   500 oceanographic stations executed in 21 expedition to the
   Mediterranean Sea basin in 1970-1995. Studies were carried in different
   seasons in the Mediterranean and the Black Seas where different trophic
   conditions and considerably different species composition and abundance
   occurred in the phytoplankton. There are of coarse differences between
   abundance of various dinoflagellates and an intensity of measurement of
   bioluminescence, but the main features of these appeared to be similar,
   the intensity of bioluminescence increased in proportion to their number
   and physiological state.
   Seasonal changes are also well developed and mostly in the Black Sea.
   Two intensive periods of bioluminescence were recorded , one in May-June
   and the other one, more intensive, in October-November. The
   bioluminescent potential was achieving 1.4 10(-2) microwatt cm(-2)
   l(-1), which exceeded minimum numbers in February 500 times. Seasonal
   cycles are weakly developed in the ogliotrophic regions in the
   Mediterranean Sea: differences of the bioluminescent potential between
   summer and winter periods achieve 3.5 times only.
   Macroscale trends of bioluminescence changes within the Mediterranean
   basin are comparable with that of the plankton spatial distribution.
   General trend of bioluminescence increase, from the Aegean Sea to the
   west and from the Algerian coast to Spain, was evaluated on the basis of
   the whole basin. Bioluminescence in the central part of the Black Sea is
   3 times weaker than in the Alboran Sea. However, it is one order higher
   than that in the central part of the Mediterranean Sea.
   As we have stated there are regions of ``clean{''} and ``polluted{''}
   waters in both nertic and open sea waters. For example, in the
   Mediterranean Sea the sentral regions of the Alboran, Ionian and Aegean
   Seas, and the central part of the western gyre and Karadag marine
   reserve of the Black Sea were all considered to have relatively good
   water quality while the regions of the intensive shipping (straits,
   southern part of the Ionian Sea near-Bosphorus region. Black Sea
   north-western part) and densely inhabited riparian zones(Crimean
   southern coast) were considered to be regions of ``ecological risk{''}.
   There are considerable differences between the parameters of the
   regression lines from the studied regions. For example, to obtain the
   same bioluminescence intensity in the 0-100 m layer, the quantity of
   dinoflagellates in polluted regions of the Mediterranean Sea would have
   been twice as abundant as those from ``clean{''} waters. Similarly the
   numbers of bioluminescent algae in the Black Sea would have increased
   3-4 times to obtain the same bioluminescent intensity. As the
   anthropogenic pressure in the Black Sea is higer, due to the population
   density in the river drainage areas and to the low water exchange the
   differences are more apparent. It can be presumed, that an organism's
   metabolic state (and hence its bioluminescence) could serve as an
   indicator for the levels of pollution in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{As a first step in the development of a conservation plan for grassland
   birds in the northeastern United States. we prioritized species based on
   the percent of estimated total breeding population in states and
   provinces throughout North America. As expected, most species had only a
   small percent of their total breeding population in the Northeast. We
   estimated that 82 percent of all Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus
   sandwichensis), 47 percent of Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus), and
   37 percent of Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorous) breed in Canada. An
   estimated 60 percent of North American Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus
   savannarum) breed in Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
   The grassland species we consider to be most at risk, Henslow's Sparrow
   (A. henslowii), has a relatively restricted breeding range with most of
   the population (more than 50 percent) in Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin
   but with a substantial percent (more than 20 percent) in the Northeast
   as well. This highlights the responsibility of different regions to the
   global, long-term persistence of species. A species-level analysis,
   however, does not consider regional genetic variability that may include
   taxonomic recognition below the species level. We considered this factor
   by repeating the above process for each subspecies of eastern grassland
   bird. We found that 100 percent of Eastern Henslow's Sparrows (A. h.
   susurrans) breed in the northeastern United States. Similarly, the
   Northeast supports 12 percent of the breeding Eastern Grasshopper
   Sparrows (A. s. pratensis) but only 4 percent of the total breeding
   population (all subspecies combined). This perspective counters the
   suggestion that the northeastern United States is unimportant for
   grassland birds. A regional grassland bird conservation plan should
   include (1) standardized inventory and monitoring, particularly for
   Henslow's Sparrow. (2) identification of key nesting sites supporting
   high diversity and abundance of grassland birds and development of plans
   for management or acquisition of these sites where appropriate; (3)
   completion of a preliminary population viability analysis for the least
   abundant species to assess the relative importance of different sites;
   and (4) development of guidelines for how private landowners and public
   land managers can manage grasslands to benefit grassland birds.}},

Abstract = {{In 1992 the George M. Sutton Avian Research Center initiated a five-year
   project to examine the nesting ecology of birds using tallgrass-prairie
   habitats in Oklahoma. The project was designed to help determine why
   grassland bird populations in the southern Great Plains are experiencing
   widespread and rapid declines. One of our objectives was to determine
   the effects of contemporary fire and grazing regimes on the nesting
   ecology of birds breeding in tallgrass prairie. From 1993 to 1995 we
   monitored nests on six 16.2-hectare plots at The Nature Conservancy's
   Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Osage County, Oklahoma. Three of these
   plots were undisturbed (unburned and ungrazed), and three were disturbed
   (burned and/or grazed) during each year of the study. We monitored
   nesting success, clutch size, and fledging rates at each of 313 Eastern
   Meadowlark (Sturnella,,magna). Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus
   savannarum), and Dickcissel (Spiza americana) nests on the six plots. We
   observed 42, 12, and 87 Eastern Meadowlark, Grasshopper Sparrow, and
   Dickcissel nests, respectively, on undisturbed plots and 60, 26, and 86
   nests, respectively, on disturbed plots. On undisturbed plots, the
   average Mayfield probabilities of nesting success for the incubation and
   brood-rearing periods combined were 0.17, 0.17, and 0.19 for Eastern
   Meadowlarks, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Dickcissels, respectively; the
   average probabilities of success on disturbed plots were 0.07, 0.06, and
   0.06, respectively. Clutch sizes and fledging rates from successful
   nests were not statistically different between plot types. These results
   suggest that physiologically the reproductive performance of these
   species was not affected by burning and grazing; however, rates of
   nesting success for Eastern Meadowlarks and Dickcissels may be
   negatively affected by these activities. Through cooperative efforts
   with private landowners, we are currently developing management
   recommendations to mitigate the effects of burning and grazing on these
   species.}},

Abstract = {{We censused vocalizations of night-migrating birds by making continual
   audio recordings of the night sky from a transect of seven recording
   stations across New York State in fall 1991-1993 and at one recording
   station in south Texas in spring 1995. Bird calls on these audio
   recordings were later detected,by human listening and by automatic
   sound-detection software. Vocalizations of several migratory bird
   species that breed in North American grasslands were found on these
   recordings. We present basic evidence for the identification of
   nocturnal flight calls of migrant grassland birds east of the Rocky
   Mountains, and we introduce a method for quantifying nocturnal
   flight-calling that theoretically derives a minimum number of
   individuals' passing over a recording station from analysis of calling
   data. Our recordings show that large numbers-of certain grassland
   species can be detected by monitoring their nocturnal flight calls and
   that using a transect of recording stations can reveal migration
   corridors. Such information illustrates this monitoring technique's
   potential as an independent means of assessing population trends and
   migration pathways. Also evident is the potential for monitoring
   secretive species and species that nest in remote areas or regions
   difficult to census by other techniques. Information gained from
   monitoring-nocturnal flight calls can be useful in determining locations
   for other,avian monitoring operations, in making decisions regarding
   long-term habitat management, and in considering such,questions as where
   to site communications towers and wind-turbine generator farms.}},

Abstract = {{Dickcissels (Spiza americana) were studied in 1990-1993, and briefly in
   1995, during the nonbreeding season in agricultural regions of the
   Venezuelan llanos. These llanos comprise the Dickcissel's core wintering
   area, and birds occurred there for more than seven months, September
   through April. Dickcissels were gregarious, feeding and roosting
   together in large flocks. We found that sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) fields
   were the preferred roosting habitat, and we estimated that individual
   roost sizes could reach three million birds. Dickcissels were mainly
   granivores in winter, and while in the llanos they fed on wild grass
   seeds and agricultural crops, especially sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) and
   rice (Olyza sativa).
   Since the 1950s, increases in cereal agriculture in Venezuela have
   provided Dickcissels with a superabundant food supply, yet the Breeding
   Bird Survey has indicated a 40 percent population reduction in North
   America since monitoring efforts were initiated in 1966. We think this
   decline has likely resulted from high overwinter mortality induced by
   lethal control operations. In many areas of Venezuela, farmers consider
   Dickcissels to be agricultural pests. Although most farmers use
   nonlethal controls to mitigate damage, some intentionally kill
   Dickcissels with agricultural chemicals. The Dickcissel's highly
   gregarious nature and small geographic range make the entire population
   vulnerable to catastrophic mortality. We propose that further efforts to
   prevent declines, and possibly to restore Dickcissel populations to
   historical levels, be aimed at reducing lethal control on the species'
   central wintering grounds in Venezuela.}},

Abstract = {{The North Sea has for many decades been one of the most heavily fished
   seas in the world. Most stocks of large predatory fishes are depleted.
   Stocks of herring and mackerel were greatly reduced during the 1970s.
   Current annual landings of sand lance are the largest single species
   catch from the North Sea at up to 1 million t. About 4 million seabirds
   breed around the North Sea. Most depend largely on sand lance as food
   during breeding. Over recent decades seabird numbers in the North Sea
   have increased considerably. Removal of sand lance by the fishery might
   be expected to have negative effects on seabirds. Seabird populations
   and breeding productivity in the North Sea are intensively monitored,
   yet there is no convincing evidence that the sand lance fishery has yet
   affected seabird numbers or breeding success.
   Three factors may explain this. First, seabirds are generally long-lived
   and have behavioral mechanisms to buffer themselves against effects of
   short-term fluctuations in fish abundance. Second, seabird consumption
   of sand lance is partly spatially separated from sand lance fishing
   effort. Third, the industrial fishery may represent a substitute for
   removal of sand lance by adult mackerel and some gadoids that occurred
   previously, such that combined predation imposed by those fishes plus
   industrial fishing appears to have remained approximately constant. All
   these possible explanations present important implications for future
   management of fishing effort in the North Sea if the fisheries and
   seabirds are to continue to coexist.}},

Abstract = {{The reliance on earthworms as test organisms in risk assessment studies
   of polluted environments raises the question whether they can evolve
   resistance, e.g., by adaptation to specific toxicants, Protection
   criteria may be biased if sensitivity data from adapted populations are
   used. Increased resistance to the heavy metal cadmium has not yet been
   determined for terrestrial Oligochaeta. Eisenia fetida was exposed to a
   sublethal concentration of cadmium sulfate for more than 10 generations.
   Clitellate worms from this culture were used in experiments to determine
   the extent of possible tolerance for the heavy metal. Preexposed animals
   as well as worms with no previous history of exposure to cadmium were
   exposed to a control substrate without cadmium and also to two
   substrates with 600 and 1200 mu g g(-1) cadmium. Changes in biomass,
   cocoon production, and hatching success were monitored. The results
   obtained indicated that in both substrates in which cadmium was present
   the preexposed worms performed better than the unexposed worms with
   respect to growth rate but not reproductively. In the substrate without
   cadmium the preexposed worms exhibited signs of poisoning after a few
   weeks. Preexposed and unexposed worms were also exposed to
   concentrations of 1500 to 4000 mu g g(-1) cadmium sulfate in an artisol
   medium for a period of 2 weeks. The preexposed worms survived higher
   concentrations of cadmium than the unexposed group and some specimens
   from the unexposed group had a gross increase in body fluids. It is
   concluded that worms with a long-term history of exposure to the metal
   developed resistance to cadmium. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Methanotrophic bacterial populations were quantified in an aquifer that
   was amended with air (oxygen), methane, triethyl-phosphate, and nitrous
   oxide to evaluate their effectiveness to stimulate aerobic
   bioremediation of vinyl chloride (VC), dichioroethylene, and
   trichloroethylene (TCE). Contaminants in groundwater resulted from
   leachate originating from a nearby landfill. Groundwater samples were
   taken during gas injection and analyzed for changes in bacterial
   populations. The methanotrophic populations were monitored in
   groundwater using direct fluorescent antibodies (FA) and the most
   probable number (MPN) technique. Acridine orange direct counts (AODC)
   were used to determine the total bacterial population. Methanotrophic
   populations increased significantly in groundwater during the course of
   gaseous nutrient injections. As methanotrophic bacteria reached a
   maximum population in 3-4 days, contaminant levels (TCE) decreased.
   Cis-dichloroethylene (c-DCE) demonstrated a transient increase in
   concentration during the experiment but decreased rapidly over the
   course of the experiment. The total number of groundwater microorganisms
   did not change, indicating a selective stimulation of the methanotrophic
   bacterial population. These bacterial data were compared to physical
   parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, redox) and contaminant (TCE, c-DCE,
   VC) concentrations within the saturated and unsaturated zone to reveal
   the efficiency of the system. The loss of contaminants appears to be due
   to cometabolic biodegradation through biostimulation since loss by
   volatilization was accounted for and was minimal. This work clearly
   demonstrates that one can effectively change the subsurface bacterial
   population in a relatively short period of time.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{115-124}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent focus has been placed on ecoregion delineations for providing an
   appropriate framework for monitoring and assessment of region-specific
   attainable water/habitat quality. Using an ecoregion approach to
   stratify variance, this study was conducted to determine whether earlier
   (subjectively) selected Swedish reference lakes may be considered as
   regionally representative reference sites when compared with a randomly
   selected lake population. Predictive modeling by discriminant function
   analysis with lakes classified by ecoregion and lake surface area and
   six physicochemical variables showed that the greater majority of
   reference lakes may be considered as regionally representative. The
   highest proportion of lake ``misclassifications{''} occurred in the
   boreonemoral ecoregion, a relatively diverse ecoregion of southern
   Sweden. This apparent bias may be in part be due to the criteria used in
   selecting regional reference lakes. In the earlier selection of
   reference lakes emphasis was placed on lakes not being adversely
   affected by land usage or pollutant discharges, consequently forest
   lakes were often overrepresented and sites in agricultural areas
   underrepresented in the selected reference sites. As a complement to
   predictive modeling, PCA ordination showed the placement of reference
   lakes within the random lake population and indicated where reference
   sites might be missing along potentially important ecological gradients.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes an intelligent system for evaluation and prediction
   of marine fish stocks and determination of allowable quotas. The system
   can forecast population abundance and biomass, possible total allowable
   catch, determine the quota allocation to subjects of fishery, based on
   various criteria. As knowledge sources, the system uses the results of
   long-term observations and research, regular dependencies established by
   experts, and human experts themselves. As initial data, monitoring and
   sampling results are used. Practical use of the system in 1995-1997
   demonstrated satisfactory agreement between the values predicted by the
   system and the actual population characteristics. The system has been
   developed using SIMER + MIR intelligent techniques (Osipov, G.S.,

Abstract = {{The persistence of an island of remnant vegetation within a tailings
   retention system provided an opportunity to conduct a pilot study to
   develop hypothesis concerning the impacts of acid spray and radiation on
   arid zone flora and fauna. Ecological changes were investigated by
   comparing species abundance and condition on both the study island and
   remote control areas. Hopbush (Dodonaea viscosa), geckos and a common
   ant species, Iridomyrmex rufoniger sp. B were abundant in control
   regions but absent from the study region, whereas densities of
   colonising plant species, Helen beetles and scorpions were unusually
   high at the impacted site. These disparities are probably attributable
   to acid spray at the impacted site and hence are potentially useful
   bioindicators of these impacts. Dragon and skink populations were
   apparently unaffected by the polluted ecosystem, although Ctenophorus
   nuchalis proved to be a significant bioaccumulator of radionuclides.
   Bioaccumulation of the radionuclides, U-238, Th-230, Pb-210 and
   particularly Po-210 were significantly greater than that reported
   elsewhere in the literature. Further radionuclide monitoring of
   herbivorous dragon species, possibly concentrating upon Po-210 levels,
   was the suggested outcome of this pilot study.}},

Abstract = {{In July 1997 the Republic of Korea became the 15th country to exceed
   10-million registered motor vehicles. The number of cars has been
   increasing exponentially in Korea for the past 12 years opening an era
   of one car per household in this nation with a population of 44 million.
   The air quality effects of the growth of increasingly congested motor
   vehicle traffic in Seoul, home to more than one-fourth of the entire
   population, is of great concern to Korea's National Institute of
   Environmental Research (NIER). AIL's Open-Path FTIR air quality monitor,
   RAM 2000(TM), has been used to quantify the ozone increase over the
   course of a warm summer day. The RAM 2000 instrument was setup on the
   roof of the 6-story NIER headquarters. The retroreflector was sited
   180-m away across a major highway where it was tripod-mounted on top of
   the 6-story Korean National Institute of Health facility. During the
   Open-Path FTIR data taking, an NIER Air Physics Division research team
   periodically tethered an airborne balloon containing a pump and a
   potassium iodide solution to obtain absolute ozone concentration results
   which indicated that the ambient ozone la el was 50 ppb when the
   Open-Path FTIR measurements began. Total ozone concentrations exceeded
   120 ppb for five hours between 11:30 AM and 4:30 PM. The peak ozone
   concentration measured was 199 ppb at 12:56 PM. The averaged
   concentration for five and a half hours of data collection was 145 ppb.
   Ammonia concentrations were also measured.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife species inhabiting contaminated sites are often exposed to
   complex mixtures of chemicals that have known effects on physiological
   and biochemical function. We evaluated the induction of major hepatic
   cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes through O-dealkylation of various resorufin
   ethers in wild cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) inhabiting three
   reference areas and three contaminated areas at an abandoned oil
   refinery Superfund waste site in Oklahoma. Isoenzyme activities were
   monitored in animals from these sites in summer and winter for 2 years.
   O-dealkylation of ethoxyresorufin and methoxyresorufin was significantly
   greater (170-180\%) in cotton rats from contaminated areas compared to
   those from reference areas in summer, but not winter. These results
   indicate that the cotton rat may be a sensitive model species for
   biomonitoring petrochemical-contaminated ecosystems and demonstrate the
   importance of multi-season sampling in biomonitoring studies. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Ground-level ozone continues to be a cause for concern in terrestrial
   ecosystems in the northeastern United States and Canada. Spreading
   dogbane (Apocynum androsaemifolium L.) is one of many indigenous
   herbaceous plant species exhibiting foliar injury that are commonly
   monitored in ecosystem assessment programs. Details about possible
   effects of ambient ozone on reproductive components of these species are
   lacking. For 103 days, from 31 May to 10 September, A. androsaemifolium
   plants were grown in open-top chambers in either carbon-filtered air
   (CF), non-filtered air (NF) (approximately 1 x ambient), or chamberless
   ambient air plots (AA). Aspects of sexual reproduction were measured to
   determine whether impairment occurs in polluted air. Additionally, the
   ozone protectant chemical ethylenediurea (EDU) was applied to foliage to
   determine its effect on foliar injury. By the end of the experiment
   visible foliar injury was absent in CF air and nominal in the NF and AA
   treatments. Plants grown in CF-chamber air produced significantly more
   flowers and fruits than those grown in either NF-chamber air or AA
   plots. Flowers produced by plants grown in CF air also survived to
   mature fruits at a rate 1.7 x greater than plants in NF air and 1.5 x
   greater than plants in AA plots. We were unable to conclude whether EDU
   protected plants from foliar ozone injury due to the general lack of
   foliar injury in ozone-exposed plants. The results demonstrate that
   foliar injury is not necessarily required to elicit negative effects on
   sexual reproduction in A. androsaemifolium. Implications for the
   population biology of A, androsaemifolium related to adverse effects of
   chronic ozone exposure on sexual reproduction are discussed. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{We studied the horizontal distribution of Cu, Ni and enchytraeid worms
   (Cognettia sphagnetorum, Vejdovsky, Oligochaeta, Enchytraeidae) in
   forest soil near a Cu-Ni smelter in SW Finland. Soil samples were taken
   from a polluted site (2 km from the smelter) and a reference area (8 km
   from the smelter). We used a hierarchical sampling design in the
   polluted area for studying possible scale-dependent variability in
   parameters measured, distance between the samples (different scales)
   being 5, 50 and 500 cm. Distribution of metals was moderately
   heterogeneous in the polluted soil; coefficient of variances (CV), 26\%
   for Cu and 32\% for Ni. Instead, distribution of enchytraeids in the
   area was highly heterogeneous (CV, 135\%) and the variability increased
   with increasing a distance between the samples: CV increased from 67 to
   104\% from the smallest to the largest sampling scale. Soil metal
   concentrations did not correlate with enchytraeid densities in the
   polluted area. However, three out of our four sampling plots having
   distance of 500 cm between each other had lower enchytraeid density than
   the reference area. Results may indicate that C. sphagnetorum has quite
   low sensitivity to metal pollution, at least on the forest stand scale.
   On the other hand, enchytraeids may have population dynamics connected
   to patches (sources-sinks) caused by uneven distribution of metals. This
   can mitigate the effects of metals on their population densities. Due to
   importance of enchytraeids in decomposition processes and the fact that
   usually only one enchytraeid species is present in boreal coniferous
   forests, they may be appropriate for field monitoring in these humus
   rich soils. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},

Abstract = {{Jaccard's distances between the aquatic bryophyte assemblages recorded
   in 1972-1973 and in 1997 in nine study sites along the Belgian course of
   the rivers Meuse and Sambre were correlated with the differences of
   concentrations of 13 physico-chemical factors (O-2, N-NO2-, N-NH4+,
   N-NO3-, P-PO43-, K+, pH, Ca++, Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn and Mn) between 1972-1973
   and 1996. The strong decrease in heavy metals pollution and the decrease
   of the trophic level are correlated with the recolonization of the most
   polluted sites in the 1970s by the pollution-sensitive species present
   in the valleys at the beginning of the century. Conversely, N-NO2-,
   N-NO3- and K+ have increased between the two surveys. They currently
   reach much higher concentrations in the Sambre than in the Meuse, as
   well as N and micro-pollutants such as pyrene and anionic detergents.
   The different loads of these factors in the studied rivers might explain
   their different recolonization patterns. Although some species might
   have developed a tolerance to certain factors, an effort to improve the
   quality of the effluents coming from industrial areas still remains to
   be made, especially in the frame of the projects of river flooding of
   the riverine areas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{441-448}},
Abstract = {{The International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, has recently
   classified crystalline silica as carcinogenic to man. This new
   assessment calls for the determination of the concentration levels of
   crystalline silica to which the general population is exposed to. This
   paper reports the results of the determinations of airborne quartz - the
   most common form of crystalline silica - in a site of the metropolitan
   area of Pome, Italy. We studied the respirable fraction of the airborne
   particulate (PM10) sampled in spring 1996 with a cascade impactor, by
   means of a scanning electron microscope equipped with an X-ray
   microprobe. Ten components were identified of which 3.7\% on the average
   was total silica (crystalline and amorphous). On the basis of these data
   we started a methodical study of quartz concentrations in the historical
   series of the PM10 daily sampled with an Airborne Particles Monitor
   (APM) apparatus at the above-mentioned site. PM10 was collected on
   cellulose filters which were then incinerated in oxygen plasma at low
   temperature to eliminate the organic component. The residue was
   deposited on silver membrane filters that were then read with a
   conventional X-ray diffractometer to determine quartz amounts. Twenty
   eight filters were analysed which corresponded to four weeks
   representative of the four seasons of 1994, the year when samples
   started to be systematically collected. Results show that the mean
   weekly concentration of airborne quartz ranged between 0.6 and 1.5 mu
   g/Nm(3), which corresponded to 1.7\% and 3.4\% of total PM10,
   respectively. These data are substantially in agreement with our
   previous data obtained with electron microscopy, and show that the
   quartz levels present in the urban atmosphere under study were
   approximately 100-fold lower than the threshold limit value (TLV),
   currently suggested by the American Conference of Governmental
   Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) for the workplaces, namely 100 mu g/Nm(3)
   - threshold that is currently applied in Italy. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{For the most population in the world, it is very important to estimate
   the yield of crops in China on Remote Sensing by satellite. For the
   complicated natural condition in China, there are many different crops
   and cultivation systems. We must divide it into different regions. On
   the base of regionalisation, we chose sample spots, monitored on spot,
   and compared with satellite images of NOAA, Landsat TM, and SPOT. We
   gain crops areas by fuzzy supervision classification, and gain yield by
   unitage yield model. Considered the influence of disaster (flood,
   drought, and typhoon), we can forecast the crop yields in 3 or 4 weeks
   before harvesting.
   In China crop yield estimation has been done for 10 years. We had formed
   a running system for wheat. Its precision is reached 98\%. The corn is
   distributed in north provinces, its estimation precision is reached
   90\%, and the corn system will be run in whole country. The rice is
   distributed in south provinces. We can forecast the yield of the
   provinces of Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei. For many
   mountains and cloudy in Sichuan province, we must do more works for it.
   The system of Chinese crop yield estimation on remote sensing has done
   many works for management of national crops product, crop
   transportation, and crops future market. We also do some work for
   circumjacent country.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional satellite control systems are based largely on operators
   monitoring screens of information and carrying out repetitive pre-set
   tasks. However increasing demands are now being placed on Satellite
   operations due to the ever-expanding population of the satellites under
   control and the complexity of the environments these spacecraft operate
   within. In an attempt to control escalating costs satellite operating
   companies are looking to more advanced techniques to assist in the day
   to day operations of the modern satellite control centre.
   This paper describes Space UNiT (Universal intelligent Toolkit), a
   component-based suite of graphical products that can accommodate any
   legacy, or new Control System. This is achieved through UNiT's key
   features that include high level automated procedures, schedules, and

Abstract = {{Predation risk can influence habitat use and activity of potential prey.
   I explored how the risk of predation by vertebrates influenced the
   behavior of grasshoppers. I monitored the height in vegetation and the
   frequency of resting, moving, and feeding behaviors of both tethered and
   free-ranging grasshoppers under exposure to various predators.
   Grasshoppers protected from birds remained high in the vegetation, while
   those protected only from small mammals and lizards remained low in the
   vegetation. Grasshoppers exposed to all predators occupied an
   intermediate height. Lower positions in the vegetation were associated
   with cooler thermal conditions, lower feeding rates, and lower food
   availability. My results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   grasshoppers utilize different microhabitats to balance the trade-off
   between reducing mortality from predators and experiencing greater food
   availability, and warmer conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The primary aim in assessing the amount of gene flow from higher plants,
   in the context of risk assessment of the release of GMO's, is to obtain
   an estimate of the distribution of the dispersal stages (e.g. pollen and
   seeds). A knowledge of this distribution will then permit estimation of
   the probability of the dispersal stage travelling further than a
   specified distance from its source. Such cumulative dispersal
   probabilities,can then be used to design both any appropriate
   confinement measures for a release and monitoring procedures to ensure
   the efficacy of the confinement.
   A standard statistical method for analysing gene-flow data is described
   and applied to data obtained from crop plants or their relatives,
   previously published in the scientific literature. The concept of
   relative risk is developed and applied to this data. Attention is drawn
   to the inherent variability of both gene flow and its estimates in these
   experiments and to the consequent problems in attempting to quantify
   risk to the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Results from monitoring the incidence and persistence of genetically
   modified (GM) oilseed rape volunteers at National List sites and at
   eight large scale release sites throughout the UK show that volunteer
   numbers in subsequent crops can vary considerably from site to site. At
   some sites volunteers were fully controlled in subsequent crops. At
   other sites viable GM seeds persisted in the soil, producing volunteer
   populations for up to three years after the release. Where GM and non GM
   varieties were grown together, the proportion of transgenic volunteers
   in subsequent crops appears to be lower than the original percentage
   grown. Initial results from this study suggest that weediness and
   invasiveness of oilseed rape volunteers is not enhanced by the specific
   genetic modifications studied.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to establish a practical index that considers
   both the size of the global range, and the mean relative abundance of
   species within their range. Detailed general distribution maps provide
   the basis for a classification of ranges into nine size categories. The
   abundance data are arranged into five categories, ranging from very rare
   to very common. These categories are derived directly from floristic
   literature. The Area-abundance-index is calculated using an empirical
   formula, i.e. by the addition of the mean relative global abundance and
   the range size category number. Values of the index range from 2 (very
   rare and range less than or equal to 10 km(2)) to 13 (very common
   throughout and range >10(7) km(2)). The main advantage of the index is
   that species become comparable in terms of their global population
   sizes. Frequently, regional Red Lists contain species that are common
   elsewhere and occupy wide areas, or may not include locally abundant
   species that occupy only very small geographical ranges. The application
   of the Area-abundance-index for the prioritizing of species within Red
   List categories and, hence, a varying assignment of conservational
   efforts, is discussed. Furthermore, the application of the index on a
   local scale, and the regional responsibility for species conservation or
   monitoring are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a project assessment and selection, planning and
   controlling system for land-use and forestry project aimed at mitigating
   net emissions of carbon to the atmosphere. Candidate projects are
   evaluated based on a catalogue of criteria that reflects the basic
   requirements projects should meet, such as acceptance by all partners
   involved (including local governments and the local population),
   consideration of property and tenure rights, consideration of
   environmental and socio-economic aspects, financial and environmental
   additionality, and minimization of leakage and reversibility. Based on
   data and qualitative information collected with a questionnaire, an
   overall project assessment is carried out 1) to determine whether
   criteria that are seen as minimum requirement or precondition to proceed
   with the project are satisfied, 2) to provide an ex-ante calculation of
   carbon stocks and fluxes of the project, and 3) to grade a number of key
   criteria according to a standardized rating system. This procedure
   allows the investor to make a selection among alternate projects. A more
   detailed plan of the key project features will then form an integral
   part of the project contract, and at the same time the basis for
   monitoring and controlling of the project as it proceeds. The project
   plan will be audited by an independent certification organization, which
   also takes on the task of auditing and certifying the ongoing project,
   including any carbon credits accrued, on a regular basis.}},

Abstract = {{A population of great crested newts (Triturus cristatus) in central
   England was monitored from 1988-1995. Recognition of individuals was
   used to quantify population dynamics. Adult annual survival varied from
   31-100\%. Long-term members of the breeding population had a
   significantly higher rate of annual survival (65\%) than individuals
   breeding for the first time (57\%). The population showed variable
   patterns of recruitment. A period of six years with little recruitment
   was followed by a rapid increase in population size, more than
   three-fold, over two years. The change in the population characteristics
   coincided with a crash in the population of predatory three-spined
   sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), raising the possibility that newt
   recruitment was held in check by predation. Juveniles were rarely
   captured, but their recapture rate between years (49\%) indicated that
   the rate of annual survival for juveniles in this population could be
   relatively high (estimated as 59\%). Most juveniles matured at two years
   of age. The study population thus consisted of long-lived adults,
   showing variable survival, and erratic recruitment. The longevity of
   adults enabled the population to persist under adverse conditions until
   beneficial circumstances could be exploited by rapidly increasing the
   population size. These demographic traits may be common in T. cristatus
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{A breeding population of Japanese toads, Bufo japonicus formosus was
   studied at two ponds in Yamakita-machi, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan,
   during the three breeding seasons of 1992-1994. The movement of toads
   between the ponds was monitored by mark-recapture studies. Although the
   two ponds were only 30 m apart, most toads did not switch ponds within
   or between years. A binomial test and bootstrap simulation rejected the
   null hypothesis that individual toads selected their breeding ponds
   randomly from year to year. Mating success and other ecological and
   behavioural characteristics were compared between male toads that
   exhibited site fidelity and those that switched ponds during the study
   period, but we could not detect any significant differences between
   them. This study demonstrated strong site fidelity in B. j. formosus,
   but failed to show quantitative advantages or disadvantages of returning

   years located on stream orders 1, 5, 6 and 8, 3. a weekly survey of the
   exceptional 1994/95 high water stage at 4 stations upstream and
   downstream of Greater Paris (10 M. people). Due to very low relief and
   even rainfall distribution over the year, the Seine and its river
   network from order 3 to 8, are characterized by very low TSS: 79\% of
   medians (C50\%) are between 8 and 32 mg l(-1) and maximum TSS barely
   reach 300 mg l(-1). Due to similar relief distributions, runoff patterns
   and geology in all sub-basins, major tributaries have near-identical
   long-term TSS regimes and seasonal variations during the 1994/95 flood
   stage. Second order TSS variations are linked to lithology: streams
   draining argillaceous and marl terrains are up to 3 and 4 times more
   turbid than those draining limestones and chalks. Basin size was also
   tested: the TSS range (quantiles C1\% to C99\%) decreases from order 1
   to 8, and quantiles levels C10\% to C75\% double from order 3 to 8.
   Human impacts on TSS levels are quite limited: Greater Paris influence
   on longitudinal profiles is not observed; in periurban streams, where
   population density reach 1000 p km(-2), TSS levels are twice those
   observed in rural conditions (40 p km(-2)): C75\% are 32 +/- 12 and 17.5
   +/- 9 mg l(-1), respectively. In orders 6 to 8, the lower TSS quantiles
   (C10\% and C25\%) are higher than in orders 3 - 5, this can be
   attributed to eutrophication and/or to an important fluvial traffic. No
   significant trend was observed on the TSS distributions at the river
   mouth from 1971 to 1997. Comparison with a previous daily survey in
   1863-1866 showed present marked decrease of average TSS and TSS yearly
   range attributed mostly to locks.}},

   simultaneously, but usually in distinct layers. Fish died in the
   relatively clear epilimnion where 10-40 million Prymnesium cells per
   litre were recorded (chlorophyll a range 6-18 mu g l(-1)). Fish survived
   in the metalimnion dominated by the hepatotoxic P. agardhii (chlorophyll
   a 20-40 mu g l(-1)). The deeper layers were anoxic. The Prymnesium-rich
   water remained ichthyotoxic until the end of August but the toxicity was
   less marked in tests with Artemia salina. As even inconspicuous
   haptophyte blooms with low chlorophyll a concentrations may be harmful,
   safety and monitoring issues need reconsideration.}},

Abstract = {{A new ice-control structure (ICS) in the Lamoille River should reduce
   ice-jam flooding in Hardwick, Vermont, by arresting breakup ice runs and
   forming stable ice jams. We are monitoring changes in aquatic habitat
   and the populations of macroinvertebrates and fish associated with this
   structure. The structure has primarily increased the area of pool
   habitat immediately upstream, likely causing three ecological changes: a
   shift from riffle- to pool-dwelling species of macroinvertebrates, a
   seasonal increase in fish abundance upstream of it, and an increase in
   the proportion of mimic shiners (Notropis volucellus) near it. These
   changes are similar to those:caused by habitat-restoration structures.
   However, we observed no influence on the abundance or distribution of
   salmonid fishes, which were very rare in all four study sections.
   Assessing the ecological impact of controlling ice breakup, the major
   effect of the ICS, will require longer term study.}},

Abstract = {{Greater Cairo is faced with increases in population and unplanned
   extensions in urbanization. This has not been followed by an equal
   expansion in water supply and sanitary drainage, thus resulting in poor
   environmental conditions. Cairo covers 300 km(2) with intensive and
   varied urban land uses and encompasses the oldest industrial areas of
   Egypt, such as Shubra-Mostorad and Helwan. In addition, new industrial
   communities are located in the western desert fringe of Greater Cairo
   with many industrial areas located in zones of highly vulnerable
   groundwater. Pollution sources of industrial origin threatening
   groundwater occur in a wide variety of both large and small industrial
   areas. Moreover the desert fringes of Cairo are being reclaimed by using
   sewage (waste) water for irrigation. The adverse environmental impacts
   of unplanned urban expansion and industrial and agricultural activities
   could lead to deterioration in groundwater quality. This has dictated
   quick interventions based on groundwater quality monitoring systems
   designed to detect pollution sources and their spatial extension. This
   paper presents groundwater quality indicators for domestic, agricultural
   and industrial pollution at representative sites within Greater Cairo.}},

Abstract = {{Current techniques for monitoring pollutant-degrading microorganisms are
   limited to standard culturing methods despite documented deficiencies.
   Fortunately, techniques based upon detection of cellular genetic
   elements can more sensitively monitor microbial populations without
   requiring culturing. Aerobic bioremediation of aromatic hydrocarbons
   generally requires the use of ring attacking and ring cleavage
   dioxygenase enzymes. Two types of ring cleavage dioxygenases exist, meta
   and ortho cleavage. Meta cleavage dioxygenases are more extensively
   characterized. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers have been
   designed using these characterizations that can detect a subclass of
   dioxygenase genes encoding enzymes responsible for the degradation of
   toluene, phenol, xylenes, and the single ring metabolites of biphenyl
   and naphthalene. These primers were used to quantify meta cleavage
   dioxygenase genes. In pure cultures this technique has been used to
   detect and enumerate eight different bacteria with various substrate
   specificities. Through optimization of PCR conditions as few as 10(3)
   genes were detected, translating to a detection limit of at least 10(3)
   cells. Overall this technique proves to be more sensitive than standard
   culturing methods and can be used to more accurately monitor
   pollutant-biodegrading microorganisms. Thus, bioremediation in the field
   can be optimized to more efficiently use resources based upon the
   response of the appropriate microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{The management of fish stocks and fisheries depends crucially on the
   availability of reliable stock assessments. More specifically, a useful
   assessment usually must include reliable estimates of the quantity of
   fish in the stock, its age and/or size composition, its rate of renewal
   (recruitment and growth), and its rate of mortality (by fishing and by
   other causes). Typically these estimates are derived from two sources;
   research surveys and data from commercial fishing operations, combined
   with biological knowledge from targeted research programmes. In recent
   years, however, the reliability of assessments has been criticised in
   many regions, and unfortunately at least some of the criticisms have
   some validity. Even more regrettably, the states of fish stocks in many
   regions are poor or declining, and in many of those cases unreliable
   assessments are implicated as part of the problem. The serious
   consequences of what has become known as ``the retrospective problem{''}
   within the stock assessment community is demonstrated to be widespread
   and prevalent even in countries which invest heavily in research and
   stock assessments. The collection of reliable data from fisheries
   operations is not just a good way, but possibly the only feasible way to
   correct the anomalies in the data associated with unreliable
   assessments. Accordingly, the features of data sets, and the biological
   and fisheries events which may cause a strong' retrospective pattern to
   occur in data sets are examined and improvements to traditional
   assessment estimates illustrated through the use of high quality
   commercial data on catches, and on the technology and procedures used in
   harvesting. To view the value of data from monitoring programmes as
   simply an opportunity to improve traditional assessments, however, is to
   undervalue those programmes. Several illustrations are presented of how
   advice on management and conservation of fish stocks can be improved if
   assessments expand beyond their traditional catch-at-age basis. Data on
   the spatial and temporal dynamics of fisheries operations, in
   particular, may be vital to detecting important trends in stocks and
   fisheries. Moreover, the singular importance of complete and accurate
   data from monitoring processes and their contribution to significant
   improvements in both research surveys and targeted scientific research
   programmes is illustrated. Finally, contemporary fisheries science and
   management has historically progressed beyond single-species assessments
   and management initiatives, to consider multi-species and ecosystem
   interactions, and the effects of the physical environment on marine
   populations. Although outside the subject matter of this discussion,
   sound monitoring programmes can contribute greatly to our knowledge in
   this larger framework, as well as contributing to improved
   single-species assessments of target species.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to monitor daily outdoor pollution conditions in order
   to issue advisory notices for those of the population more susceptible
   to the effects of pollution. These conditions are currently conveyed to
   the public via a single number and descriptor, known as the Pollutant
   Standards Index (PSI). The objective of the present work is to improve
   on some of the shortcomings in the PSI.
   Given the constraints inherent in a single value representing the
   complex associations called air quality, the New Pollutant Index (NPI)
   has been introduced that is a more adaptable index than the current PSI.
   New standards can be incorporated easily, and synergistic effects can be
   accounted for and adjusted pending conclusive studies. The NPI needs to
   be tested in the longterm to verify that it is a reasonable reflection
   of the air quality for widespread areas. This can be done by comparing
   the air ratings given by the index with the documented complaints of
   respiratory and other ailments associated with the criteria pollutants.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-47}},
Abstract = {{Many lakeside Phragmites australis reeds are frequently harvested or
   burnt in winter for several purposes like extraction of raw material,
   natural preservation or facilitation of professional fishing or fish
   breeding. The question is, whether these practices support a sustainable
   development of the reeds. Data from a long term monitoring program at
   Lake Constance (Germany) demonstrate that culm morphology, stand
   structure and aboveground peak biomass are strongly influenced by the
   treatment. Winter harvested and burnt reeds exhibited higher culm
   densities (+76\% of the untreated controls), and a higher peak biomass
   (+13\%). The mean culm height was reduced by -13\%. The percentage of
   insect infested shoots was 8.8\% of the total shoot population compared
   with 20.1\% of the untreated controls. Consecutive harvesting treatments
   intensified these effects. In the first two years after the treatment
   had stopped the reed stands showed an `overshoot' biomass production,
   and a strong trend towards the features of the untreated controls. The
   possible mechanisms (mechanical damage, frost kill of the growth tips
   and breaking of the apical dominance) are discussed. It is concluded
   that winter harvesting and burning treatments make the reeds more
   susceptible against some environmental hazards, and should therefore
   applied with precaution on the basis of a close examination of risks and
   benefits.}},

Title = {{Allometry of territory size and metabolic rate as predictors of
   self-thinning in young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17-26}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Self-thinning is a progressive decline in population density caused
   by competitively induced losses in a cohort of growing individuals and
   can be depicted as: log(10) (density) = c - beta log(10) (body mass).
   2. In mobile animals, two mechanisms for self-thinning have been
   proposed: (i) the space hypothesis predicts that maximum population
   density for a given body size is the inverse of territory size, and
   hence, the self-thinning slope is the negative of the slope of the
   allometric territory-size relationship; (ii) the energetic equivalence
   hypothesis predicts that the self-thinning slope is the negative of the
   slope of the allometric metabolic rate relationship, assuming a constant
   supply of energy for the cohort.
   3. Both hypotheses were tested by monitoring body size, population
   density, food availability and habitat for young-of-the-year Atlantic
   salmon (Salmo salar) in Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick. The results were
   consistent with the predictions of the space hypothesis. Observed
   densities did not exceed the maximum densities predicted and the
   observed self-thinning slope of -1.16 was not significantly different
   from the slope of -1.12, predicted by the allometry of territory size
   for the population under study.
   4. The observed self-thinning slope was significantly steeper than
   -0.57, predicted by the allometry of metabolic rate. perhaps because of
   a gradual decline in food abundance over the study period. The decline
   in density was more rapid in very shallow sites and may have been partly
   caused by a seasonal change in water depth and an ontogenetic habitat
   shift rather than solely by competition for food or space.
   5. The allometry of territory size may be a useful predictor of
   self-thinning in populations of mobile animals competing for food and
   space.}},

Abstract = {{The population dynamics of a ``leading edge{''} (= at the edge of the
   expanding gypsy moth invasion) gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.),
   population was monitored for 3 years (1995-97), with emphasis on the
   interactions of the gypsy moth nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdNPV) and
   the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu, \& Soper. Gypsy moth
   populations in the woodlots varied from very sparse to high (potentially
   defoliating) levels. LdNPV was strongly density dependent, being
   confirmed only from the higher populated woodlots. In contrast, the
   fungus was similarly active in both sparse and highly-populated
   woodlots. In 1995, the fungal epizootic developed late in the season,
   with most larvae succumbing during stadia 5-6 and producing mainly
   resting spores (azygospores). Estimated mortality due to fungus averaged
   68\% in high-density plots and 85\% in low-density plots. LdNPV
   mortality occurred in a two-wave epizootic, although second-wave LdNPV
   mortality was undoubtedly reduced because of the reduction of
   late-season larvae due to fungus activity. Estimated mortality due to
   LdNPV averaged 14\% in highly-populated plots and 1\% in low-population
   plots. In 1996, high levels of fungal-induced mortality occurred earlier
   in the gypsy moth season than in the previous year. Most gypsy moth
   larvae in 1996 died in a mid-season wave of fungal-induced mortality,
   with necropsied cadaver containing only conidia. This resulted in
   relatively few larvae surviving to late instars. At this time, a second
   wave of fungus-induced mortality occurred, with over half of the
   necropsied cadavers containing resting spores, The depletion of the
   gypsy moth populations by the fungus in 1995 resulted in a greatly
   reduced first wave of LdNPV in all plots in 1996, and perhaps due to the
   early appearance of the fungus in 1996, LdNPV was nearly absent from
   late-season larvae collected from all plots. In 1997, gypsy moth
   populations were uniformly low, and no dead larvae were found in any of
   the plots.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of caesium isotopes (Cs-134 and Cs-137) from the
   Chernobyl fallout in nestlings of two breeding populations of Pied
   Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) in central Norway was determined from
   1986 to 1992. The birds at the Luru site showed a mean accumulation of
   844, 535, 383, 607, 515, 348 and 327 Bq kg(-1) during these years. At
   Lauvsjoen, the corresponding accumulation was 102, 111, 74, 89, 293, 175
   and 193 Bq kg(-1). In 1996, the levels had decreased to 118 Bq kg(-1) at
   Luru and 32 Bq kg(-1) at Lauvsjoen. The mean values of radiocaesium
   activity in the nestlings rose a few years (1989 and 1990) after the
   accident in 1986. The data show large variations within and between
   years in the initial period of this study, suggesting that these
   ecosystems were not at equilibrium during this period. However,
   equilibrium may have been approached during the last years. The
   measurements from 1992 and 1996 correspond to an ecological exchange
   rate of 0.22 year(-1) at Luru and 0.34 year(-1) at Lauvsjoen (on average
   0.28), implying an approximate ecological half-life equivalent for
   caesium transfer in the monitor organisms, the young flycatchers, of 3.2
   years at Luru and 2.0 years at Lauvsjoen (on average 2.6 years). (C)

Abstract = {{Po-210 is available to the Irish marine environment as a result of
   natural and anthropogenic processes. As it constitutes a significant
   portion of the radiation exposure of the population through the
   consumption of seafood, it is of interest to identify a suitable
   bio-indicator to monitor fluctuations of Po-210 concentrations in the
   marine environment. Mytilus edulis was examined to assess the
   geographical variation in Po-210 concentrations around the coast of
   Ireland. Temporal variations and the effect of mussel size on their
   Po-210 contents at two sites, Sutton and Carlingford, were also
   examined. Chemical techniques for the separation of Po-210 from mussels
   seawater and suspended particulate are described. These methods use
   Po-209 as a chemical yield monitor, microwave systems and Teflon bomb
   procedures for sample digestion. The concentration of Po-210 in mussels
   around the coast was found to vary between 80 +/- 9 Bq kg(-1) (dry wt.)
   at Seapark near Belfast and 468 +/- 32 Bq kg(-1) (dry wt.) at Sutton in
   Dublin. The two sites at Sutton and Carlingford, which displayed
   similarities in terms of mussel morphology and Po-210 concentration in
   water, exhibited significant temporal variations in mussel
   concentration. Furthermore, relationships derived from both sites
   indicate a strong linear dependency between mean Po-210 content and mean
   mussel dry weight with higher concentrations of Po-210 found in smaller
   mussels at a given site. Concentration ratios for mussels and water are
   also presented. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Mexico City with a population of about 18 million people relies on
   groundwater to supply about 70\% of its water needs. In order to
   understand the extent of microbial pathogen contamination of these
   reserves, a 10 month long monitoring study of the southern aquifer was
   undertaken. Groundwater samples were collected from five different
   locations and analyzed (100 mL) for total coliforms, fecal coliforms,
   and fecal streptococci. Larger volume samples (5 L) were collected and
   concentrated for quantitative and qualitative (presence/absence)
   determination of microorganisms including bacteriophages. Gene
   amplification (PCR) approaches were employed to screen for Escherichia
   coli/Shigella specific (uid) sequences. Laboratory microcosms were
   conducted to evaluate the potential survival of pathogenic viruses in
   the groundwater using MS-2 and PRD-1 as model viruses. Coliphage as a
   single indicator, or in conjunction with fecal coliforms and fecal
   streptococci were found to have value as an indicator of fecal pollution
   in this geographical region. The results indicate that the southern
   aquifer underlying metropolitan Mexico City can pose a significant risk
   to public health when water is distributed and used without adequate
   disinfection. The pumping wells located in the transition and mountain
   areas indicated the presence of extensive microbial pathogen
   contamination. There was surprisingly, no difference between the dry and
   rainy seasons in terms of the presence of fecal pollution microbial
   indicators.}},

Abstract = {{The developmental origin of phenotypic plasticity in morphological shape
   can be attributed to environment-specific changes in growth of overall
   body size, localized growth of a morphological structure or a
   combination of both. I monitored morphological development in the first
   four nymphal instars of grasshoppers (Melanoplus femurrubrum) raised on
   two different plant diets to determine the ontogenetic origins of
   diet-induced phenotypic plasticity and to quantify genetic variation for
   phenotypic plasticity. I measured diet-induced phenotypic plasticity in
   body size (tibia length), head size (articular width and mandible depth)
   and head shape (residual articular width and residual mandible depth)
   for grasshoppers from 37 full-sib families raised on either a hard plant
   diet (Lolium perenne) or a soft plant diet (Trifolium repens). By the
   second to third nymphal instar, grasshoppers raised on a hard plant diet
   had significantly smaller mean tibia length and greater mean residual
   articular width (distance between mandibles adjusted for body size)
   compared with full-sibs raised on a soft plant diet. However, there was
   no significant phenotypic plasticity in mean unadjusted articular width
   and mandible depth, and in mean residual mandible depth. At the
   population level, development of diet-induced phenotypic plasticity in
   grasshopper head shape is mediated by plastic changes in allocation to
   tissue growth that maintain growth of head size on hard, low-nutrient
   diets while reducing growth of body size. Within the population, there
   was substantial variation in the plasticity of growth trajectories since
   different full-sib families developed phenotypic plasticity of residual
   articular width through different combinations of head and body size
   growth.
   Genetic variation for diet-induced phenotypic plasticity of residual
   articular width, residual mandible depth and tibia length, as estimated
   by genotype-environment interaction, exhibited significant fluctuation
   through ontogeny (repeated measures MANOVA, family x plant x instar, P <
   0.01). For example, there was significant genetic variation for
   phenotypic plasticity of residual articular width in the third nymphal
   instar, but not earlier or later in ontogeny. The observed patterns of
   genetic variation are discussed with reference to short-term constraints
   and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.}},

   needed to build a strong scientific foundation for informed decision

Title = {{The phytoplankton zooplankton link in the Lake Ontario food web}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{239-249}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring in Lake Ontario in 1970 and 1982 demonstrated that the
   zooplankton community was dominated by microzooplankton, which suggested
   a longer, perhaps inefficient food chain. In this study, annual
   monitoring of the offshore region of lab Ontario between 1986 and 1992
   was used to determine if microzooplankton were still dominant despite
   recent changes in nutrient loading and species introductions.
   Microzooplankton accounted for 49.7\% of the total summer zooplankton
   biomass while small edible phytoplankton accounted for 67.0\% of the
   biomass during the summer. By direct in situ measurement using a Haney
   grazing chamber, rather than size grazing relationships, the relative
   impact of micro- and mesozooplankton grazers on phytoplankton production
   during the summer of 1995 was evaluated. Microzooplankton filtration
   rates (\%/d) for 1995 were significantly higher than mesozooplankton
   filtration rates. Zooplankton consumed only 17.5\% /d of the primary
   production with microzooplankton grazing representing 69.8\% to 93.2\%
   of this amount. Microzooplankton are clearly still dominant and their
   consumption of primary production in Lake Ontario is low. The major
   pathway of energy transfer can not be through the classical
   phytoplankton > large zooplankton > planktivore > piscivore food chain
   but rather through the phytoplankton > microzooplankton and presumably
   predacious zooplankton and fish. The longer food chain is a result of
   the introduction of a size-selective planktivore, the alewive, which has
   decreased the length and presumably lowered the consumption rate of the
   entire zooplankton community. This structural impact, a longer food
   chain, theoretically creates a higher factor of biomagnification of
   organic chemicals for top-level predators along with lower rates of
   energy transfer within the food web and suggests lower fish production
   than in a shorter food web.}},

Title = {{Rapid increase and subsequent decline of zebra and quagga mussels in
   Long Point Bay, Lake Erie: Possible influence of waterfowl predation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Distribution and density of two introduced dreissenid specics of
   mollusks, the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and quagga mussel D,
   bugensis, were monitored ill the Inner Ba at Long Point, Lake Erie.
   1991-1995. Since populations of certain waterfowl species have been
   reported to alter their dietary intake and migration patterns in
   response to the ready availability of zebra mussels, the percent
   occurrence of migration mussels in the diet of 12 duck species (552
   birds) was studied concurrently, and several spring and fall aerial
   waterfowl surveys were flown between 1986 and 1997 (n = 75), to document
   changes in duck populations at Long Point. The first reproductive
   population of zebra mussels on the bay most likely appeared in 1990.
   After an initial rapid increase in density and colonization of the Inner
   Bay, zebra mussels began to steadily and consistently decline in
   absolute numbers, density per station and occupied area. Mean density
   per station in 1995, was 70\% less than in 1991, the first year of rapid
   colonization, and 67\% less than in 1992, the year of peak abundance in
   the bay (P < 0.05). Occupied area peaked in 1992, with 80\% of sampling
   stations supporting mussels; the followings 3 years showed consistent
   declines in the proportion of stations suppporting mussels: 1993 =
   75.9\%. 1994 = 63.2\% and 1995 = 57.1\% (P < 0.05), Mussels in size
   class 0 to 5 mm were most abundant in 1991, 1993 and 1995, whereas those
   in size class 6 to 10 mm pre dominated in 1992 and 1994 (P < 0.05). Very
   few mussels over 15 mm were found. Lesser Scaup Aythya affinis (75.4 to
   82.5 \% occurrence), Greater Scaup A. marila (66.7 to 81.5 \%
   occurrence), and Bufflehead Bucephala albeola (46.7 to 60 \%
   occrrrrence), were the only three waterfowl species that consistently
   incorporated zebra mussels in their diet, and the mussel decline
   coincided with a substantial increase in the populations of these
   species at Long Point. Waterfowl days for Lesser and Greater Scaup
   combined increased rapidly from 38,500 in 1986 (prior to the zebra
   mussel colonization of Long Point) to 3.5 million 1997 (P = 0.012).
   Bufflehead days increased from 4,700 to 67,000 during the same period (P
   = 0.001). Oligotrophication of Lake Erie, through reduced plankton and
   chlorophyll concentration, has occured since the invasion of zebra
   mussels. probably a result of filtering activities of introduced
   mussels. While a reduction in plankton availability may have contributed
   to the zebra mussel decline, high rates of waterfowl prediction probably
   had the most substantial effect on mussel densities at Long Point,
   Waterfowl predation also probably influenced the size structure of the
   zebra mussel population. since waterfowl are size-selective foragers and
   increased water clarity would have facilitated their ability to select
   preferred medium and large size classes of mussels. Quagga mussels,
   which were first detected in 1993, experienced a decline in both
   density. and area occupied ol,er the next two years. Quagga mussels
   rarely attached to soft substrates, and their decline is possibly
   related to the decline of suitable hard substrates, such as zebra
   mussels, as well as to predation by waterfowl.}},

   paddy soils. The study focused mainly on the effect of pesticides on the
   nitrogen cycle such as nitrification, ammonification, protease activity
   and ammonium oxidizing bacterial population (AOB) being what was
   monitored. The coefficient of variation(CV) was the statistical tool
   used to monitor the variability in the study. During the two growing
   seasons, the CV for nitrification, ammonification, protease activity and
   AOB were 16-20, 39-53, 31-62 and 88-174\%, respectively, which reflects
   the fluctuation caused by the natural stresses as well as anthropologic
   stresses. These results were much wider than the fluctuation observed in

Abstract = {{Evidence is presented for the importance of western lowland gorillas as
   seed dispersers in the Lope Reserve, Gabon. The survival and growth of
   seedlings of three tree species, growing from dung deposited at gorilla
   nest sites, were monitored for up to 2 y after deposition. A comparison
   was made between this and seeds (i) deposited in dung on gorilla feeding
   trails, (ii) dropped (spat out) under conspecific canopies, and (iii)
   scatter-dispersed (spat out) by other consumers away from conspecific
   trees but under intact forest canopy. The highest survival and the best
   performance of seedlings was always at a gorilla nest site, although not
   every site was favourable for survival or growth. Seedling performance
   was related to the surrounding vegetation conditions: better performance
   was observed in seedling clumps with less vegetation cover. Gorillas at
   Lope apparently provide high quality seed dispersal for these species,
   not just because they consume large quantities of seeds, but because the
   pattern of seed deposition, especially in nest sites, can result in the
   enhanced survival and growth of seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{I collected line transect data and capture-recapture data to estimate
   basic demographic parameters of Zenaida doves (Zenaida aurita) in
   farmlands and second-growth forests in eastcentral Puerto Rico during
   1990-92. Zenaida doves are widely hunted, and data on demographic
   parameters are needed for population management and monitoring. Mean
   survival rate and mean capture rate per sampling period of hatching-year
   (HY; <(<(phi)over cap>)over bar>(i) = 0.73, <((p) over cap)over bar>(i)
   = 0.07) and after-hatching-year (AHY; <(<(phi)over cap>)over bar>(i) =
   0.75, <((p) over cap)over bar>(i) = 0.06) doves did not differ (Ps >
   0.10). The standard Jolly-Seber model with time-specific survival and
   capture rates fit the capture-recapture data (Model A in JOLLY; P >
   0.10). There was no difference between the survival and capture rates of
   newly versus previously captured HY and AHY birds (Ps > 0.10). Survival
   and capture rates varied by sampling period (Ps < 0.01). For AHY and HY
   birds combined, mean survival rate per sampling period was 0.84, and
   mean capture rate was 0.05. Mean population size was 1,451, and mean
   recruitment rate (births + immigrants) was 591/sampling period. Density
   of Zenaida doves was 0.97-1.78/ha during 1991-92. Density of nests was
   2.44/ ha during January-December 1991, 1.69 during April-June 1991, and
   1.44 during April-June 1992. Line transect surveys of Zenaida doves and
   nests were positively correlated (P < 0.01). The number of Zenaida doves
   and nests was positively correlated with capture-recapture estimates of
   population size (P < 0.10) and number of fledglings trapped for the
   first time (P < 0.02). Predator abundance was negatively correlated with
   number of nests located on the transects (P < 0.01), number of
   fledglings trapped for the first time (P less than or equal to 0.001),
   and estimates of recruitment rate (P < 0.05). Overall, mean daily nest
   survival rate was 0.98, and mean nesting success rate was 0.51; mean
   number of young fledged per nest was 1.31. Predation caused 88\% of nest
   losses. Zenaida doves are well adapted for multiple brooding and
   extended nesting, and they are able to compensate for periods of low
   survival (deaths and emigration) via high recruitment rates (births +
   immigration).}},

Abstract = {{Translocation of nuisance raccoons (Procyon lotor) is a common practice,
   but the fates of translocated animals after release are not known. We
   monitored postrelease survival rates and dispersal of radiocollared
   raccoons that were trapped as nuisance wildlife in suburban Chicago and
   translocated to a rural forest preserve (translocated urban), trapped in
   another wooded area and translocated to the forest preserve
   (translocated rural), and trapped and released in the forest preserve
   that served as the release site for the translocations (resident).
   Thirty-one raccoons were radiotracked in autumn 1993, and 45 were
   radiotracked in autumn 1994. We detected no differences in survival
   rates among the 3 treatment groups (P > 0.05). Resident raccoons tended
   to remain in the vicinity of the release site, whereas translocated
   raccoons left the release site within hours to days and dispersed into
   the surrounding area. Dispersing raccoons had high daily movement rates
   for the first 2 weeks postrelease but then seemed to establish new home
   ranges. Translocated raccoons frequently denned near human residences
   and in agricultural fields, whereas resident raccoons denned primarily
   in the forest preserve. Because translocated raccoons survived well,
   translocation could be an effective way to supplement depleted or
   reestablish extirpated populations of this species. However,
   translocating large numbers of raccoons for animal damage control could
   cause problems for other wildlife and human residents near release
   sites, and translocated animals could serve as vectors for wildlife
   diseases during zoonotic outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Effective, economical management of waterfowl populations requires an
   understanding of age-, sex-, and cause-specific forces of mortality. We
   used radiotelemetry to estimate survival rates of immature mallards
   (Anas platyrhynchos) from fledging to autumn migration in northcentral
   Minnesota. We monitored 48 females and 42 males during 1972-74 and
   observed 31 deaths during 2,984 exposure-days. We attributed 7 deaths to
   predation and 24 to hunting. Survival rates were 0.86 (SE = 0.047) for
   the postfledging-prehunting period, 0.29 (SE = 0.107) from the onset of
   hunting to migration, and 0.25 (SE = 0.094) for both periods combined.
   Natural mortality of fledged young had a negligible effect on
   recruitment to migration. Reducing natural mortality of fledged juvenile
   mallards would not have been a feasible means of increasing recruitment.
   Management strategies that increased nest success, increased brood
   survival, or decreased hunting mortality would more likely have produced
   meaningful gains in recruitment and are worthy subject's for continuing
   study. In northcentral Minnesota, changes in waterfowl habitats,
   predator populations, and hunting pressure have probably not changed the
   relative importance of hunting and nonhunting mortality to fledged
   juvenile mallards since our data were collected.}},

Abstract = {{Aspects of coexistence between the dwarf crocodile Osteolaemus tetraspis
   and the Nile monitor lizard Varanus niloticus were studied in swamp rain
   forests of south-eastern Nigeria, central Africa. Crocodiles were
   si,significantly smaller than monitor lizards. There was no significant
   sexual size dimorphism in the examined sample of Varanus, whereas the
   female size exceeded the male size in Osteolaemus. The food niche
   breadth was narrower in young than in adults of both species, and V.
   niloticus showed a narrower niche breadth than O. tetraspis. Crabs
   constituted the main prey type category for both species, whereas
   vertebrates were more rarely preyed upon. The diet composition of males
   and females was similar in V. niloticus, but it was different in O.
   tetraspis. The general diet composition of the two species was similar
   (78.2\% of overlap), and even the habitats where these two species were
   found were similar. These interspecific similarities suggest that O.
   tetraspis and V. niloticus could be potential competitors in the
   freshwater ecosystems of the Nigerian rainforest. However, it is
   suggested that the main prey type for these species (crabs) is not
   limited in the environment, which may minimize interspecific
   competition. Interference competition can also occur between these
   species, as suggested by one case of direct predation of the one species
   (V. niloticus) towards the other species (O. tetraspis). A case of
   cannibalism was observed in V niloticus. This could indicate that
   intraspecific competition can be important for regulating the dynamics
   of monitor populations in the rainforests of south-eastern Nigeria.}},

Abstract = {{Seabirds become mature at a late age, experience low annual fecundity,
   often refrain from breeding, and enjoy annual adult survival rates as
   high as 98\%. This suite of life history characteristics limits the
   capacity for seabird populations to recover quickly from major
   perturbations, and presents important conservation challenges. Concern
   over anthropogenic impacts on seabird populations has led to the
   initiation of long-term field programs to monitor seabird reproductive
   performance and population dynamics. In addition, seabirds have been
   recognized as potentially useful and economical indicators of the state
   of the marine environment and, in particular the status of commercially
   important prey stocks. This paper reviews demographic and Tife history
   attributes of seabird populations and uses this information to explore
   the consequences of longevity from the respective standpoints of
   conservation and monitoring goals. Analysis of a simplified life cycle
   model reveals that maximum potential population growth rates (lambda)
   under ideal circumstances fall within the range of 1.03-1.12 for most
   species, though growth rates realized in nature will always be lower.
   Elasticity analysis confirms that seabird population growth rates are
   extremely sensitive to small Variations in adult survival rates, and
   dictates that survival monitoring should be considered an essential
   component of conservation strategies. As in other organisms with long
   life spans, ecological and physiological costs of reproduction are
   expected to figure prominently in seabird reproductive decisions.
   Consequently, understanding how seabirds allocate reproductive effort in
   response to varying environmental conditions is an important
   prerequisite for correctly interpreting held data from monitoring
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Long-lived marine species are particularly vulnerable to human
   perturbations for reasons related both to the species' demographics and
   human perception. Marine turtles provide an illustrative example:
   species delay maturity from 10 to as late as 30-60 years, and human
   monitoring of turtle populations focuses primarily on nesting adult
   females and nest production. Apparently marine turtles are trading early
   reproduction for later reproduction at a larger size, facilitating
   higher fecundity to overcome variable, often very high, natural
   mortality in eggs and early life stages. Human perturbations increase
   mortality of marine turtles at all life stages. However, population
   modeling has shown that annual survival of some stages, particularly
   large juveniles and adults, may be particularly critical to population
   maintenance and recovery. At the same time, monitoring focused on the
   larger, usually older, life stages of long-lived marine species may be a
   relatively poor indicator of actual population health and trends. High
   bycatch of long-lived marine species in long-line fisheries is outlined
   and concerns raised. Precautions, based on long-lived species'
   vulnerability and the limitations of our ability to adequately monitor
   population status, should be built into management regimes.}},

   artificial and natural types. An hierarchical approach gives the
   opportunity for estimation of the quantitative behavior of both

   can use interactions of studied macroorganisms (man, animal, higher
   plant) with selected microorganisms as key indicating factors of the
   organisms immune status. The most informative factor for the
   population/community level is an age structure of populations and
   relationships of domination/elimination. The integrated key factors of
   the ecosystems level are productivity and rates of cycling of the
   limiting substances. The key factors approach is of great value for
   growth regulations and monitoring the state of any ecosystem, including

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to assess the ability of gulf toadfish
   (Opsanus beta) from an intertidal population in northern Florida to make
   and excrete urea as a nitrogenous waste product, Using an electronic
   tide gauge and data logger, we were able to demonstrate that toadfish in
   the intertidal mudflats at Panacea, Florida were air-exposed
   approximately 9.3\% of the over 2000 h monitored, and that these periods
   could last as long as 9 h, Toadfish were collected from this site during
   several seasons in 1993-1994, and were subjected to experiments which
   measured their nitrogenous waste production (as ammonia and urea).
   Samples were also analyzed for several biochemical proxies of urea
   excretion (including liver ornithine-urea cycle (O-UC) enzyme
   activities, and activities of nitrogen feeder enzymes, including the key
   enzyme glutamine synthetase, GSase), as well as plasma cortisol, urea
   and other variables. Although freshly collected toadfish from Panacea
   exhibited relatively high activities of thr O-UC enzymes, they showed
   rather low activities of GSase, indicating a low potential for immediate
   urea production. Furthermore, urea excretion rates were extremely low
   during the first 24-36 h in captivity, even when toadfish were subjected
   to an experimental emersion period of 8 h intended to simulate
   air-exposure in nature. When compared to responses and values of
   subtidal toadfish From Biscayne Bay, Florida published in a prior
   report, and from a single sample of subtidal toadfish at Panacea, it is
   apparent that urea synthesis and excretion in the gulf toadfish are
   likely not a direct consequence of air-exposure during the tidal cycle.
   Our data ate discussed in the context of an ammonia-exposure hypothesis
   explaining urea synthesis and excretion in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Planktonic populations and benthic resting stages (akinetes) of the
   common bloom-forming cyanobacteria Anabaena circinalis Rabenhorst and
   Anabaena flos-aquae f. flos-aquae (Lyngb.) Komarek were monitored in the
   Murray River near Nildottie and in adjacent floodplain wetlands
   (lagoons) from 1995 to 1997, to determine the extent of sporulation and
   the contribution of recruitment from the sediments to seasonal
   development of blooms. Physical and chemical characteristics of the
   water in the river and the lagoons were examined in relation to the
   succession of key life-cycle stages and growth. The warm, shallow
   lagoons supported considerably higher populations of Anabaena in the
   summer than did the river, with correspondingly higher incidence of
   sporulation. Viable akinetes were abundant in the sediments of both the
   river channel and the lagoons, providing a potentially significant
   inoculum for cyanobacterial growth. The apparent germination of akinetes
   early in summer and immediately following sporulation in mid summer
   indicated a strategy for both initiation and maintenance of populations.
   A. circinalis also persisted as a planktonic population throughout
   winter. Germination is considered more likely to occur in the shallow
   lagoons than in the main channel, principally because of frequent
   resuspension of sediments containing resting stages to the euphotic zone
   or because of direct penetration of light to the sediments.}},

Abstract = {{As the biomass of a fish population is reduced by fishing, the mean size
   (length or weight) of individuals in the population can be expected to
   decrease. Thus, it should be possible, in principle, to detect changes
   in fishing pressure by monitoring mean size. A simulation experiment was
   carried out to see whether this might work in practice with New Zealand
   freshwater eel fisheries. Information on the dynamics of eel populations
   was used to construct a simulation model of a fishery with a range of
   exploitation scenarios. It was found that size data, by themselves,
   could be useful for detecting large longterm changes in stock status,
   but are not likely to be good indicators for use in year-to-year
   management. Natural variations in eel recruitment cause substantial
   year-to-year variations in the mean size of eels, even when fishing
   pressure is constant. This makes it difficult to detect changes in size
   caused by longterm changes in fishing pressure. Even without sampling
   error, biomass would need to drop by more than 40\% (or more, if the
   drop is gradual) before this change could be reliably detected. The
   presence of typical levels of sampling error makes this detection even
   harder.}},

Title = {{Scope for growth of the estuarine mysid Neomysis integer (Peracarida :

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{1999}},

Pages = {{233-241}},
Abstract = {{Mysids (Peracarida: Mysidacea) are standard test organisms used
   routinely in acute tests to evaluate the comparative toxicity of
   chemicals to aquatic organisms. The criticism of such lethal
   measurements for ecosystem monitoring has resulted in a clear need for
   sub-lethal tests that enable a more comprehensive understanding of the
   potential impacts of toxicants on natural populations. Neomysis integer,
   the dominant mysid of the upper reaches of European estuaries, has
   relatively low 96 h LC50 values for pesticides and trace metals, and is
   under investigation as a suitable species for monitoring the pollution
   status of European estuaries. In this paper, the effects of
   environmentally realistic concentrations of the organophosphate
   pesticide chlorpyrifos on some basic physiological processes of N.
   integer are evaluated as potential end points for indicators of
   environmental pollution. Oxygen consumption, egestion rate (used as a
   measure of feeding rate) and scope for growth (an integrated measure of
   the overall physiological status of an organism) were significantly
   affected by chlorpyrifos exposure. In contrast, absorption efficiency
   was unaffected by pesticide exposure. Chlorpyrifos effects were most
   pronounced following short (i.e. 48 h) compared with longer exposure
   periods (e.g. 168 h). Increased oxygen consumption was the most
   sensitive toxicity Lest end point for detecting chlorpyrifos exposure,
   however, this response may not apply to all toxicants. Reduced scope for
   growth and egestion rate are considered more representative of the
   effects of chlorpyrifos on natural mysid populations, but were only
   affected significantly at near-lethal exposure concentrations. All 3
   responses were affected at concentrations lower than those currently
   acceptable by European Community legislation for potable waters.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the patch dynamics of the intertidal seagrass Zostera
   novazelandica an 2 reef platforms in order to understand the processes
   governing the establishment, maintenance and mortality of patches. The
   size distribution of patches at 3 tidal heights (low, mid and high
   shore) was assessed. Eighty patches, ranging in initial size from 0.1 to
   2.4 m(2) surface area, were tagged and video image analysis was used
   bi-monthly for 14 mo to calculate rates of expansion and contraction of
   these patches. Permanently marked 150 m(2) areas of reef were monitored
   monthly to record patch recruitment and mortality. initially, 75\% of
   patches were <0.5 m(2). All patches decreased in size during winter,
   probably due to increased wave action, and expanded during spring and
   summer. The proportional expansion and contraction of patches was
   independent of initial patch size. At the end of the study the size
   distribution of patches was similar to the initial distribution. Patch
   mortality was restricted to those <0.4 m(2), of which 60\% disappeared
   during the study. Larger patches suffered partial mortality through
   fragmentation. No large patches were formed through the amalgamation of
   smaller patches. Seedlings recruited into small sediment pockets in
   tidepools during spring, but few survived through summer because of
   removal by wave action. Experimental perturbation of patches resulted in
   increased erosion followed by decreased growth rates and, in many small
   patches. mortality. Removing only seagrass blades, however, resulted in
   increased production of new shoots relative to controls. Overall,
   seagrass patches are susceptible to disturbance, successful recruitment
   by seedlings may be rare or at least episodic, and populations are
   probably long-lived and depend on slow vegetative growth for maintenance
   and expansion.}},

Abstract = {{The dominant components of the mid-shore community of 4 sheltered, rocky
   shores in the south of the Isle of Man, UK, were surveyed. A 2-way
   factorial experiment to investigate the community structuring roles of
   Ascophyllum nodosum (hereafter Ascophyllum) canopies and Patella vulgata
   grazing was undertaken at 1 site and monitored over a period of 6 yr.
   Removal of the canopy had a marked impact on the understorey community,
   with both direct and indirect effects. In contrast, the effect of limpet
   removal was limited, owing to the restriction of this grazer to small
   patches of bare substrate within a turf of red algae. The Ascophyllum
   canopy directly facilitated the presence of the red algal turf in the
   mid-shore; canopy removal resulted in bleaching and death of turf
   species with a consequent loss of entrapped silt. This degradation of
   the turf resulted in an increase in the area grazed by limpets and a
   subsequent increase in limpet recruitment, proportional to the increased
   area of bare substratum. Thus, the Ascophyllum canopy indirectly limits
   the population of P. vulgata by facilitating the growth of a red algal
   turf. Eighteen months after Ascophyllum removal, a mixed canopy of Fucus
   vesiculosus and Fucus serratus developed. This acted in a similar manner
   to the original canopy, providing shade for turf species, which resulted
   in restoration of the balance between algal turf and limpet grazing.
   Despite this, the red algal turf had not fully recovered 5 yr after it
   was originally bleached, illustrating the long-term effects of
   Ascophyllum canopy loss on this community. Removal of the canopy also
   resulted in high levels of Ascophyllum recruitment, but the slow growth
   rate of these juvenile plants meant that nearly 6 yr after canopy
   removal, an Ascophyllum canopy had still not developed. Nonetheless, we
   predict that Ascophyllum will eventually outcompete the established
   Fucus spp. canopy. Detailed examination of the distribution of
   Ascophyllum juveniles suggests that the low density of juveniles in the
   natural population is due to a lack of substratum free from both limpets
   and space-occupying turf, rather than a direct effect of the canopy.}},

Abstract = {{A natural planktonic assemblage of organisms (<240 mu m) was studied in
   mesocosm experiments for 7 d under varying conditions of ultraviolet-B
   radiation (WB: 280 to 320 nm): UVB excluded, natural radiation and WE
   enhanced at 2 different levels. Specifically. the changes in
   Prymnesiophyceae abundance and Light scatter properties attributed to
   cell size (CS) were investigated by flow cytometry during the first 72 h
   with 4 h temporal resolution and were thereafter examined during the 4
   following days with twice daily sampling. In addition, the specific rate
   of photosynthesis (p(cell)) of phytoplankton <5 mu m, ciliate abundance
   (predator 15 to 35 mu m) and dynamics of nutrients were monitored.
   Prymnesiophyceae ranged in size between 2.7 and 4 mu m and dominated the
   phytoplanktonic community <5 mu m (more than 94\%). Prymnesiophyceae
   exhibited marked diel variability with synchronized cell division: CS
   increased during the day and diminished at nighttime, indicating cell
   division. Shortterm UVB exposures during the first 3 d of the experiment
   did not affect CS, probably due to vertical water mixing in the
   mesocosms moderating harmful UVB exposure. In contrast, long-term UVB
   treatments (3 to 7 d) induced progressive CS increases in
   Prymnesiophyceae as a function of increasing UVB doses. The successive
   inhibition of p(cell) of phytoplankton <5 mu m was also observed as a
   function of increasing WE doses. The results suggest that enhanced UVB
   provokes the retardation of cell division and inhibition of p(cell)
   which causes Prymnesiophyceae CS enlargement. CS enlargement and
   probably a change in the food quality of Prymnesiophyceae could result
   in food limitation for the ciliate population. although ciliates seem to
   be directly affected by WE enhancement. This study highlights the
   ecological implications of CS changes and photosynthetic capacity of
   phytoplankton, with respect to predator-prey interactions in response to
   WE enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis was proposed that shore fishes and crabs, predators other
   than gastropods, may be primarily responsible for depletion of barnacle
   populations in the vicinity of crevices through thigmotactic behaviour
   during foraging. To test this hypothesis, movements of mobile predators
   on barnacle-dominated rock in the lower intertidal zone were observed
   using a fixed underwater television camera. An area of 0.2 m(2) was
   monitored continuously for 14 d on a vertically oriented but relatively
   protected shore on the west coast of Scotland. Infrared lights during
   nighttime high tides Lit the area. Stereo photography was used to
   determine the topography of the area. The principal species seen by day
   was the blenny Lipophrys pholis (L.) while the shore crab Carcinus
   maenas (L.) was the most frequent species at night. Scorpion fish
   Taurulus bubalis (Euphrasen), dogwhelks Nucella lapillus (L.) and a
   single North American mink Mustela vison Schreber were also seen.
   Movements of crabs, and especially blennies, were concentrated around
   small-scale concavities in the rock surface of less than 10 cm
   dimensions, supporting the primary hypothesis. Times spent by Lipophrys
   pholis and Carcinus maenas in 0.001. m(2) (10 cm(2)) areas within the
   Video frame varied by 3 and 2 orders of magnitude. respectively These 2
   species are known to be active predators of barnacles Semibalanus
   balanoides and showed behaviour consistent with attacks on barnacles as
   prey. Observed movements and apparent spatial concentration of attacks,
   especially around crevices. may be a cause of patchiness in barnacle
   populations at this scale.}},

Abstract = {{A monthly census of resident fishes in tide pools was made at 3 sites on
   the Portuguese west coast, from 1993 to 1997. A total of 43 tide pools
   was monitored. Results of manipulation (addition and removal)
   experiments are presented. There is a very high level of consistency in
   the numbers of species at 1 site. Experiments on removal and addition
   show that the number of fish in the pools returns to normal in a few
   weeks. The inter-annual fluctuations of recruitment are less pronounced
   as the fish grow, possibly due to density dependent mortality. At the
   other 2 sites, where the pools are disturbed by storms that reshape
   their contents and move large quantities of sand, there is a less
   consistent pattern. The agonistic behaviour of tide pool fishes is
   strongly related to the priority of access to holes and crevices and
   this may place Limits on the number of fishes of a given size that can
   exist in each pool as a function of topographic complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Nearshore fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages of the Port
   River-Barker Inlet estuary, South Australia, were sampled by beach seine
   at monthly intervals between January 1985 and December 1994.
   Multivariate analyses were used to determine patterns in species
   distribution and abundance, to determine the influence of site, month
   and year on assemblage structure, and to identify trends in species
   composition over the decade. A total of 403 626 individuals representing
   56 species were recorded, with Aldrichetta forsteri, Hyporhamphus
   melanochir, Sillaginodes punctata and Pelates octolineatus responsible
   for 76\% of the total abundance. Estuarine-opportunistic species were
   consistently dominant over the decade with marine stragglers and
   estuarine-dependents important in some years only. Abundances of the 19
   species determined to be dominant varied between years, with some
   species, e.g. Spratelloides robustus, Hyporhamphus regularis,
   Arenigobius bifrenatus, Nesogobius sp. 3 and Cristiceps australis,
   demonstrating considerably greater inter-annual variability compared
   with others, e.g. S. punctata, A. forsteri, H. melanochir, P.
   octolineatus, Haletta semifasciata and Sillago schomburgkii. The
   importance of temporal scale in any assessment of community stability is
   re-stated; although individual species varied in abundance between
   months and years, assemblage structure was shown to be reasonably stable
   over the decade. Water temperature and salinity were weakly correlated
   with patterns in species composition and abundance. Further experimental
   studies are required to improve ecological understanding of the system's
   fish fauna and on-going monitoring is necessary to assess future changes
   to fish populations in relation to adjacent wetland developments.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history aspects of 2 common cnidarians, Parazoanthus axinellae and
   Alcyonium acaule, were studied in the northwestern Mediterranean over 2
   yr. Rates of growth (i.e, area gained) and shrinkage (i.e. area lost),
   colony fission and fusion, mortality, feeding activity and preliminary
   data on recruitment (for A. acaule) were measured. Independent growth
   and shrinkage rates of P, axinellae were measured as area gained and
   lost per month respectively using a photographic and computer-assisted
   image analysis. Measurement of growth in A, acaule was based on size
   variations of the colonies over 2 yr. Results indicated moderate growth
   dynamics for P. axinellae and very slow growth by A. acaule. Growth
   rates and shrinkage rates in P. axinellae showed non-significant
   differences over time, although growth rates peaked during summer to
   autumn periods for both monitored years. In general, growth dynamics for
   the cnidarians studied were similar to or lower than those reported for
   related species from temperate and tropical habitats. Fission events
   were common in P. axinellae. Of the colonies monitored, 29 \% underwent
   at least 1 fission event in 2 yr. Fusion events occurred less
   frequently; only 8 \% underwent 1 fusion event. Neither fusion nor
   fission occurred in A. acaule. Mortality rates were about 10 \% yr(-1)
   for both species. Preliminary data showed low recruitment rates for A.
   acaule. Data on life-history traits were interpreted as evidence for
   distinct biological strategies used to persist and to occupy new
   substrata. P. axinellae based its strategy on a greater dynamic
   spreading over the substrata at moderate rates, by somatic growth and by
   fission. In contrast, A. acaule showed relatively slow growth but
   greater longevity.}},

   and total monocyte count. Wild harbor porpoises had fewer white blood
   cells, lower relative total number of neutrophils and lymphocytes, and
   higher percentages of monocytes and eosinophils than reported in the
   literature far captive porpoises. Compared to published values for other
   odontocetes, the hemograms of harbor porpoises were most similar to
   those of Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus). These
   hematology data represent a baseline from free-ranging harbor porpoises
   that can be used as a reference for long-term monitoring of the health
   of this population and as a tool for rehabilitation facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change, oil development, and environmental contamination are
   threats to the polar bear population of the Barents Sea. The
   international ``Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears{''}
   mandates that Norway, and other jurisdictions, shall manage polar bear
   populations in accordance with sound conservation practices. Yet,
   despite long term recognition of their importance, estimates of polar
   bear population size and trend in the Barents Sea are not available. To
   explore the utility of line transect methods for estimating polar bear
   abundance, we reanalyzed data collected in previous aerial surveys.
   Also, we performed a pilot survey in the Barents Sea in April-May 1994.
   Reanalysis of strip surveys performed in 1986-1988, revealed encounter
   rates of 0 to 11.33 bears/100 km and densities of 0 to 19.83 bears/100
   km(2). We saw no bears during 667 km of transect line near Sorkapp in
   May 1994. During 3,089 km of transect lines also flown in 1994 near
   Hopen Island, 29 bears were observed within 1000 m of the flight line.
   Seven bears were seen along the first 1,942 km of that survey. By
   concentrating survey effort nearer the ice-edge in the second half of
   the survey, we observed 22 bears along the next 1,147 km of transect
   line. Three key functions (uniform, half normal, and hazard rate) were
   examined to model the detection function, g(x). The key function was
   adjusted by one of three series expansion (cosine, simple polynomial,
   and Hermit polynomial). Analyses were run with all nine combinations of
   the three key functions and three adjustment functions. Analyses assumed
   a common detection function in the two surveys. Model selection was
   based on minimum Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The uniform
   function with a cosine adjustment of order one gave the smallest AIC.
   The densities were estimated to 0.33 and 1.78 bears/100 km(2) for the
   two surveys, respectively. Our density estimates were generally higher
   than those from other aerial surveys of polar bears in drifting pack
   ice. We compared aerial line transect surveys with the mark and
   recapture technique to estimate polar bear population size. We believe
   line transect surveys will be the most economical and effective means to
   estimate and monitor the polar bear population size in the Barents Sea.}},

Abstract = {{The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) occupies the Bering and
   Chukchi seas between the United States and Russia, and has fluctuated
   over the past 200 years as a result of exploitation. Between 1880 and
   1980, annual harvests were as high as 9000 in some years. High harvests
   in much of that time interval were not sustainable. While the present
   harvest is below historical highs, its impact on the population is not
   known. Efforts to monitor the population size and trend are necessary to
   conserve walrus populations. Surveys of Pacific walruses have been
   hampered by a variety of problems. Early efforts were not coordinated
   between American and Russian researchers. The chronology of efforts was
   coordinated in 1975, 1980, and 1985, but survey designs differed. In
   1990, scientists were exchanged and sampling designs were shared.
   However, ice distribution confounded interpretation of results. Walrus
   numbers often were estimated without estimates of precision. Variances
   were calculated only for portions of sea-ice surveys, and land haulouts
   usually were counted only once. When they were calculated, confidence
   limits approached the size of the estimate. On sea ice, walrus numbers
   were estimated from counts on one or two days when very large numbers
   were observed. It was assumed that on these days a peak fraction of the
   population was hauled out. Problems with past surveys include: walruses
   could move between land haulouts acid nearby sea ice in the Western
   Chukchi Sea during the course of a survey, walrus groups on sea ice,
   numbering up to several thousands, were difficult to count with
   accuracy, weather and lack of aircraft restricted timing and location of
   sampling efforts. After participating in and reviewing results of past
   surveys, I recommend consideration of a survey in the spring. This
   survey should incorporate deployment and monitoring of satellite
   transmitters, and replicated counts on both the sea ice and at land
   haulouts. Data for all surveys should be averaged then corrected for the
   average fraction of observations of walruses available to be counted.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of aggregation sites can provide unbiased estimates of annual
   trends in population size if the proportion of the population counted at
   these sites does not vary systematically among years. However, counts at
   these sites tend to be highly variable and resulting trend estimates
   typically have poor precision. I developed an index based on a simple
   parametric model for counts of Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus
   divergens) at haul-out sites in Bristol Bay, Alaska that accounted for
   the general temporal pattern of variability in the proportion of the
   population at the sites. Simulations suggested that an index based on
   mean annual counts was a more sensitive indicator of trend than the
   model-based index or the currently used index based on maximum annual
   counts. The model-based index may be more useful for other situations
   where timing of the aggregation peak is more variable.}},

Abstract = {{Demographic parameters were investigated as potential biological indices
   of population status (i.e,, population size relative to ca. capacity)
   for walrus using an individual, age-based population model.
   Density-dependent changes in juvenile survival rates, birth rates and
   maturation rates regulated growth in the simulated population. Because
   only qualitative knowledge of population regulation is available for
   large, long-lived mammals, like walrus, different functional
   relationships between the regulatory parameters and population size were
   used to examine changes in potential biological indices. Age-specific
   rates of survival and reproduction specified in the model yielded a
   maximum growth rate of 8\%. Because survival rates are unknown for
   walrus, the model's growth rate should not be considered an estimate of
   the maximum growth rate for walrus. Only birth rates, measurable as
   successful ovulation rates, appear to be relatively robust to the
   assumptions of population regulation incorporated in the model, and thus
   may be a potential index of population status. However before biological
   indices can be incorporated into a management scheme for walrus,
   variability in parameter estimates due to the availability bias of the
   harvest needs to be quantified and a measure or index of population size
   identified.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in pollution control and monitoring technologies,
   improved analytical capability, changes in government priorities and
   results of scientific studies have substantially changed our views and
   perceptions towards marine pollution in the last two decades. Globally,
   the problems caused by eutrophication, water borne pathogens and
   xenobiotic compounds are likely to be exacerbated and pose significant
   ecological and/or public health risks in the coming years, especially in
   developing countries. The large amount of anthropogenic input of
   nutrients has caused major changes in the structure and function of
   phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic and fish communities over large
   areas, and such a trend is likely to continue in many coastal waters.
   Escalated public health risks associated with the increases in frequency
   and severity of toxic algal blooms are also of growing concern.
   Reduction of nutrient input through changes in land-use and farming
   practises, and the development of cost-effective methods for nutrient
   removal are required. Water borne pathogens affect large numbers of
   people through consumption of contaminated seafood and direct contact
   with contaminated water, and such problems are much more serious in
   developing countries. Current techniques in monitoring bacterial
   indicators in water and shellfish have clear limitations and cannot
   afford adequate protection to safeguard public health. Emerging
   molecular techniques, such as multiplex PCR and specific gene probes,
   are likely to provide new and cost effective tools for monitoring water
   borne pathogens in the coming years. Nowadays, xenobiotic compounds can
   be found almost everywhere in any marine ecosystems. Although these
   compounds normally occur at very low concentrations and their effects
   are not well understood, there is growing concern about the chronic
   exposure and bioconcentration/biomagnification of xenobiotic compounds.
   In particular, endocrine disrupters which may cause reproductive
   dysfunction and threaten species survival, are of growing concern. At
   present, most of our knowledge on toxic effects of xenobiotic compounds
   is derived from short-term exposure of a single species to high
   (environmentally unrealistic) and uniform concentrations under
   laboratory conditions. Data so derived are largely inadequate in
   predicting ecological effects in the field, in which multi-species are
   being exposed to varying, low concentrations under an interacting and
   complex environment. NOEC and LOEC for population/community/ecosystem,
   as well as the time required for population/community/ecosystems to
   recover after toxicant insult, are poorly known. These important
   topics,will become the major endeavours for ecotoxicologists in the
   years to come. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal marine ecosystems in many parts of the world are under
   unrelenting stress caused by urban development, hazardous or toxic
   substances, overfishing, habitat destruction, the introduction of exotic
   species and natural toxins. Biomonitoring plays a vital role in
   governmental and industrial strategies to identify, assess, control and
   reduce these problems. Sensitive and practical techniques in
   biomonitoring are needed in all of the strategic approaches - from toxic
   chemical rating and classification, to pollution source control, status
   and trends monitoring, and assessments of ``marine ecosystem health{''}.
   Due to the shear magnitude and scope of the challenge, biomonitoring
   coastal ecosystems demands new and innovative approaches that are
   relatively easy and cheap to deploy and that provide timely and
   accessible information to environmental managers and policy makers.
   This paper explores recent developments in microscale toxicity testing -
   a branch of aquatic toxicology involving the discovery and application
   of small-scale, innovative, sensitive, practical, inexpensive and
   frequently automated biological techniques. Highlights of a recent
   unique synthesis (Wells et al., 1998) are given, describing microscale
   tests at various biological and phylogenetic levels. Many of these tests
   are marine and focus on gametes, embryos and other young life stages.
   They can be utilized in the field (in vivo), with field collected
   samples, and in the laboratory. Their low cost, sensitivity,
   practicality and speed are their strengths, and commercial test kits
   have been developed as a result. But being largely ``single-species{''}
   and sub-individual-level biomonitors, do such microscale tests provide
   information directly useful to protecting vital ecosystem processes?
   Indeed, how can this question be addressed? The needs and challenges of
   matching the most promising of the microscale tests with higher level
   (population, community, ecosystem) measurements to protect habitats and
   biodiversity are discussed. Improving marine biomonitoring and
   protecting coastal ecosystem health demands such new techniques within
   the context of new paradigms and rigorous approaches for their
   application. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anilinopyrimidines constitute a novel group of broad spectrum
   fungicides. In Switzerland three representatives are registered to
   control Botryotinia fuckeliana (Botrytis cinerea) causal agent of grey
   mould. Two anilinopyrimidine fungicides, mepanipyrim and pyrimethanil,
   are used as solo compounds and one, cyprodinil, is used in a mixture
   with the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil. Currently in Switzerland the
   application of anilinopyrimidine solo products is restricted to one
   application per year and plot to control B. fuckeliana and twice per
   year and plot if the anilinopyrimidine is used in combination with
   fludioxonil. In our previous work we have established a method to test
   the sensitivity of anilinopyrimidines in vitro by using a defined
   minimal medium. We established a baseline and developed a monitoring
   procedure based on testing on one single discriminatory dose. Cross
   resistance between all three anilinopyrimidines in B. fuckeliana was
   demonstrated. Finally, we studied the genetic basis of field resistance
   to anilinopyrimidines. In this paper we focus on the presentation of
   results from a special trial site in Richterswil, Switzerland where we
   have observed a population shift towards reduced sensitivity of B.
   fuckeliana to anilinopyrimidines. The significance of our data is
   discussed with respect to the antiresistance strategy recommended in
   Switzerland.}},

Abstract = {{Cyprodinil, an anilinopyrimidine fungicide, has broad-spectrum activity
   against a range of important plant pathogens, including Venturia
   inaequalis, Botrytis cinerea, Tapesia spp. and Erysiphe graminis. To
   help assess the risk of resistance against cyprodinil and design
   appropriate use recommendations, reliable methods have been developed to
   measure the sensitivity of these pathogens to the compound. The
   sensitivity of V. inaequalis is monitored by both in vitro (germ tube
   elongation on synthetic medium), and in vivo tests ton apple seedlings).
   Baseline sensitivity was established with 59 isolates from Europe in
   1994 and 1995 which showed a narrow sensitivity range-factor of up to 13
   between the least and most sensitive isolates. Monitoring of populations
   originating from cyprodinil treated orchards between 1994 and 1997
   showed only sensitive isolates, and good product performance was
   recorded. Current data also show that cyprodinil is not cross-resistant
   to triazole and strobilurin fungicides, but is cross-resistant to other
   anilinopyrimidines, e.g. pyrimethanil and mepanipyrim. Under
   experimental conditions of excessive exposure to anilinopyrimidines (up
   to 18 applications per season for 5 years) and high disease pressure,
   sensitivity of V. inaequalis populations can be forced to shift. To
   manage this risk, anilinopyrimidine fungicides must be used with an
   appropriate anti-resistance strategy. Within the framework of
   FRAC-Anilinopyrimidine Working Group guidelines, NOVARTIS therefore
   recommends maximum of 4 applications per season, applied between bud
   burst and end of flowering, followed by treatment with fungicides
   belonging to other non cross-resistant chemical groups e. g. the
   triazoles. Used in this manner under commercial conditions, no shifts in
   sensitivity have been observed at locations in Italy, Switzerland and
   Germany. As has been previously also recommended for the control of
   Botrytis cinerea, strict adherence to anti-resistance use strategies is
   essential to the durability of this new class of compounds.}},

Title = {{Detection of linked QTL for soybean brown stem rot resistance in `BSR

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to map the gene(s) conferring resistance
   to brown stem rot in the soybean cultivar BSR 101. A population of 320
   recombinant inbred lines (RIL) was derived from a cross of BSR 101 and
   PI 437.654. Seedlings of each RIL and parent were inoculated by
   injecting stems with a suspension of spores and mycelia of Phialophora
   gregata, incubated in a growth chamber at 17 degrees C, and assessed for
   resistance by monitoring the development of foliar and stem symptoms.
   The population also was evaluated with 146 RFLPs, 760 AFLPs, and 4
   probes for resistance gene analogs (RGAs). Regression analysis
   identified a significant association between resistance and several
   markers on Linkage Group J of the USDA-ARS molecular marker linkage map.
   Interval analysis with Mapmaker QTL identified a major peak between
   marker RGA2V-1 and AFLP marker AAGATG 152M on Linkage Group J. A second
   peak, associated only with stem symptoms, was identified between the
   RFLP B122I-1 and RGA2V-1, also on Linkage Group J. When composite
   interval mapping with QTL Cartographer was used, two linked QTL were
   identified with both foliar and stem disease assessment methods: a major
   QTL between AFLP markers AAGATG152E and ACAAGT260, and a minor QTL
   between RGA3I-3 and RGA3I-2, These results demonstrate that composite
   interval mapping gives increased precision over interval mapping and is
   capable of distinguishing two linked QTL. The minor QTL associated with
   the cluster of RGA3I loci is of special interest because it is the first
   example of a disease resistance QTL associated with a resistance gene
   analog.}},

Abstract = {{Methylene chloride is present in shallow groundwater beneath an
   industrial facility. Groundwater sampling results from the study area
   indicate a limited, well-defined plume smaller than that predicted by
   groundwater modeling. To explain the difference between the model
   prediction and sampling results, laboratory microcosm studies were
   performed to assess microbial activity, and natural attenuation
   parameters were added to the sampling program. Laboratory microcosm
   data, using soil and groundwater from within and upgradient of the
   contamination, showed that the microbial population within the plume
   could utilize methylene chloride as a source of carbon and energy and
   also demonstrated that these organisms were absent outside of the area
   of contamination. Groundwater sampling results provide evidence of
   significant anaerobic microbial activity and dechlorination based on
   elevated levels of carbon dioxide and methane within the plume and
   elevated levels of chloride downgradient of the plume. These field data
   indicate an anaerobic, microbial dechlorination process is occurring
   within the plume. From these data we conclude that natural attenuation,
   due to a localized microbial population, has inhibited movement of the
   methylene chloride plume.}},

Abstract = {{Battelle conducted an evaluation of the ecological and human health
   effects of the February 1994 blowout of AGIP's oil well Trecate No. 24,
   located near Trecate, Italy, that is ongoing. Battelle's ecological
   assessment consisted of: 1) estimating exposure and effects of selected
   receptor species to oil and residual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs); and 2) monitoring the recovery of wildlife populations in the
   affected areas. Battelle's human health assessment consisted of an
   evaluation of exposure of the local fanning community to PAHs in
   bioremediated soils, those dissolved in the underlying acquifer, and
   those present in foods such as fish, frogs, and garden fruits and
   vegetables. By 1997, estimated ecological risks to predators of frogs
   and small mammals, both common in the agricultural area affected by the
   oil spill, were generally within acceptable limits in comparison to a
   similar background area. However, ecological risks for the same
   receptors were ten to one hundred times higher in areas of highest soil
   contamination immediately around the well site. These risks were due
   primarily to potential cancerogenic rather than toxic effects. By 1997,
   bird and small mammal populations had generally returned to normal in
   the effected area. The ecological effects due to habitat change, i.e.,
   closing of the affected area to irrigated agriculture, appear to have
   been greater than those caused by exposure to oil and its PAH residuals.
   With regard to preliminary human health effects due to exposure to PAH
   residuals in food, estimated cancer incidence and toxicological risk for
   adults, based on conservative assumptions, are on the order of 10(-3)
   divided by 10(-4) and 6.88 (hazard index), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated willow removal as a technique for enhancing habitat for
   birds of braided rivers by monitoring five bird species at three sites
   in the Mackenzie Basin, New Zealand, from 1991 to 1994 Four species -
   banded dotterel (Charadrius bicinctus), pied stilt (Himantopus
   novaezelandiae), black-fronted tern (Sterna albostriata) and South
   Island pied oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) used the areas of
   riverbed cleared of willows for nesting and foraging, at the same or
   greater density than other areas of riverbed already free from willows.
   Wrybills (Anarhynchus frontalis) were occasionally seen in cleared areas
   of riverbed but were not nesting there during the study. Densities of
   banded dotterel and wrybill were lowest at sites with the greatest
   densities of willows, and only three out of 327 monitored nests were
   located in willow habitat. Nest predation rates did not differ
   significantly among sites with differing levels of willow infestation,
   nor did they differ between areas of cleared riverbed and riverbed
   already free from willow. In addition to weed control, predator control
   may be necessary to increase bird populations. This study indicates that
   willow removal increases foraging and nesting habitat for some river
   bird populations, but further surveys are necessary to assess whether
   willow removal has any long-term benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Large scale aerial poison operations with 1080-carrot baits are used
   extensively to control possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) populations in New
   Zealand forests for ecosystem conservation purposes and to stop the
   spread of bovine tuberculosis. Although various procedures have been
   implemented to reduce the incidence of bird kills, dead birds continue
   to be found after poison operations. Colour-banded North Island robins
   (Petroica australis longipes) were monitored in treatment and
   non-treatment areas to determine the costs and benefits of aerial
   1080-carrot bait operations to robin populations. An August 1996
   operation, that included much chaff or fine particles of bait, resulted
   in 43\% mortality of territorial birds (banded and unbanded or 55\%
   mortality of colour-banded birds. During the same period there was no
   robin mortality in the non-treatment area. By comparison, the September
   1997 operation, that included minimal amounts of chaff, resulted in just
   8.6\% and 9.7\% robin mortality as determined by territory mapping and
   of banded birds, respectively. These levels of mortality did not differ
   significantly from that evident in the non-treatment area. Monitoring of
   possums and rats indicated that both populations were at very low
   densities and remained so during the robin nesting seasons
   (September-February) following the operations. Robin breeding was
   particularly successful in the treatment areas following the two poison
   operations (mean of 3.7 and 3.8 fledglings per pair) compared with that
   in the non-treatment area in 1996-97 (0.4 fledglings per pair) and in
   the post-treatment area in 1997-98 (1.5 fledglings per pair). Through
   recruitment of the fledglings, both populations had more robins and a
   greater proportion of females one year after the possum control
   operations than immediately before. Thus the results suggest that as
   long as carrot bait protocols are strictly adhered to and baits are
   distributed over large blocks of forest so that mammalian predator
   populations remain low during the next robin nesting season, the robin
   populations will benefit from aerial 1080-carrot possum control
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{This study was initiated in response to concerns that vertebrate pest
   control operations in New Zealand may be having deleterious impacts on
   invertebrate populations and, secondarily, on insectivorous non-target
   vertebrate populations. Invertebrates feeding on non-toxic baits of the
   types used for vertebrate pest control were collected and identified.
   The bait types were diced carrots and three types of cereal-based baits
   (No.7, RS5, and AgTech). The study was conducted in two rata/kamahi
   dominated forests (Bell Hill Scenic Reserve and Kopara Forest, West
   Coast), in July and September 1996. The most common species found on
   baits was the ant Huberia brouni (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Other common
   taxa were Orthoptera (at least eight species of weta including
   Zealandosandrus aff. gracilis, Gymnoplectron sp., and Pleioplectron
   sp.). Coleoptera (at least nine species of beetles including Saphobius
   nitidulus, Nestrius sp., and Phrynixus sp.), Dermaptera (at least one
   species of the earwig Parisolabis sp.), Opiliones (at least three
   species of harvestmen), and Acarina (at least three species of mites).
   The ants and weta were found predominately on cereal-based baits, and
   the beetles, earwigs, harvestmen, and mites predominantly on carrot
   baits. More invertebrates were found on carrot and RS5 cereal-based
   baits than on the other two bait types, and more on baits at night than
   during the day. Fewer invertebrates were found on cinnamon-flavoured
   baits (used for 1080-poisoning of possums) than on plain baits (used for
   brodifacoum-poisoning of rodents). The number of species and number of
   individual invertebrates found on baits were a small proportion of the
   number likely to be present in the forest litter. We predict that
   vertebrate pest control operations are unlikely to have any long term
   deleterious impacts on invertebrate populations. This prediction should
   be tested by monitoring populations of invertebrate species, found to
   ear baits, during vertebrate pest control operations.}},

Abstract = {{Stoats were monitored by three methods through an aerial 1080 poisoning
   operation at Waimanoa, Pureora Forest in August 1997. Tracking rates and
   number of live captures were used as indices of abundance, and
   radio-transmitters were used to follow individual animals. All 13 stoats
   with radio-transmitters within the poisoned area died between 2-18 days
   after the operation. No mustelids were tracked or live-trapped after the
   operation for three months. Of the radio-tracked stoats that died, rat
   remains occurred in 67\%, passerine birds in 17\%, cave weta in 17\% and
   possum in 8\%. Residues of 1080 were found in 12 of the 13 dead stoats.
   Our findings have important implications for the management of
   threatened species. Stoats are known to be a major factor in the
   continuing decline of some native birds. Previously, the potential of
   secondary poisoning to control stoats land other predators) in New
   Zealand had focused on the use of anticoagulants, as these compounds
   persist and can accumulate in predators over a longer period. However,
   our results suggest that secondary poisoning with an acute toxin can
   also be highly efficient. This may also have greater public
   acceptability.}},

Abstract = {{Brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) in central Northland have been monitored
   for up to 32 months of sustained exposure to brodifacoum poison. The
   cereal baits were placed in bait stations to target brushtail possums
   (Trichosurus vulpecula). Annual survival of 55 radio-tagged adult kiwi
   in two poisoned forest patches has been high (95.9\%), and similar to
   that in two nearby unpoisoned forest patches and in the patches before
   poison was used (95.3\%). The two adult birds tested of the four that
   died in the poisoned areas had no traces of brodifacoum at the detection
   limit of 0.05 mg kg(-1). With an improved detection limit of 0.02 mg
   kg(-1), no traces of brodifacoum were found in nine eggs collected over
   18 months after adults were first exposed to the poison. Of four chicks
   tested (detection limit: 0.005 to 0.02 mg kg(-1)), that had apparently
   died of natural causes or were killed by predators, three contained
   traces of brodifacoum (0.01 - 0.18 mg kg(-1)). The median survival of 39
   radio-tagged chicks in the poisoned areas (36 days) was significantly
   better than that of 18 chicks in untreated areas nearby (15 days). Kiwi
   chicks may be more vulnerable than adult kiwi to accidental poisoning
   because of physiological or behavioural differences; however, the
   effects of sustained exposure to low levels of brodifacoum poison may
   not be visible in the adult population for several years. At this stage
   of the ongoing study, the benefits to kiwi of this method of pest
   control outweigh the costs, because chick survival is greatly improved.}},

Abstract = {{In 1996 an eradication operation against two species of rats (Rattus
   norvegicus and R. exulans was conducted on Kapiti Island (1965 ha) and
   its small offshore islands. Trials with non-toxic baits had been carried
   out to help determine the risks to non-target species, and research was
   undertaken to collect baseline data for measuring the response of
   vegetation, invertebrates, reptiles and birds to the removal of rats.
   Talon 7-20 bait (containing 0.002\% brodifacoum) was distributed over
   Kapiti Island in September and October by helicopter and by hand, while
   bait stations were used on the offshore islands. Impacts on birds and
   reef fish were investigated. Although there were non-target bird deaths
   as a result of the poisoning operation, post-eradication monitoring
   indicated that the toxin had no deleterious effect on breeding and most
   losses would be rapidly made up by recruitment of new individuals into
   the breeding population. There was no evidence that reef fish were
   negatively affected.
   The successful removal of rats has apparently resulted in a
   significantly improved survival rate for stitchbirds (Notiomystis
   cincta) and saddlebacks (Philesturnus carunculatus). Benefits to other
   taxa are expected and will be documented as follow-up studies are
   completed.}},

Abstract = {{Experience with many inventories for single and multiple resources has
   resulted in suggestions to be considered when sampling multiple
   resources. Discussion begins with the design of the sampling unit and
   continues for such items as sampling design, sampling over time and
   projections of future status. Specific recommendations are given for
   each area discussed.
   Many inventories are originally designed to monitor status and trends of
   a single resource. There have been inventories for timber, wildlife,
   agricultural crops, wetlands and other resources. In almost every case,
   those relying on information from the inventories have concluded that
   other information is needed. Plant and animal responses are usually
   affected by their surroundings. Timber must be characterized by its
   environment in order to evaluate its availability for harvest. Wildlife
   inventories usually must combine habitat measures as well as population
   densities and trends. Before long, it appears that there are many multi
   resource inventories-that each single-resource inventory has now become
   an inventory of multiple resources. Then pressure is exerted or felt to
   combine these inventories in order to eliminate waste and overlap. There
   are good reasons for doing this as well as several reasons for being
   very cautious in doing so. Unless there is agreement among users that
   the information derived from a single multi resource inventory meets
   their needs, the inventory may create more problems than it solves.
   Putting many things together does not necessarily save money. Larger
   field crews may be needed, and measurement times may be greatly
   increased. What follows are some guidelines for a multi resource
   inventory based on my experience with several single-purpose inventories
   and some efforts to expand those inventories to multi resource
   inventories.}},

Abstract = {{Amazingly little is known about the biodiversity of the U.S. due to a
   lack of systematic, multi-scale surveys of multiple biological groups.
   Even the best studied areas, the U.S. National parks, report a knowledge
   of only 50\% to 80\% (or less) of their species of vascular plants,
   birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes. More is known about
   ``charismatic megafauna{''} and less is known about small creatures that
   contribute most to biodiversity. Wildlife surveys are not often
   coordinated with habitat surveys or controlled studies, so Little is
   known about the causes of population trends. Often poor sampling designs
   and field techniques are used to survey and monitor biodiversity. Many
   existing monitoring program are poorly standardized and are not
   cost-effective. New resource inventory and monitoring programs must be
   carefully designed, statistically sound, peer reviewed, and well
   supported.
   I discuss commonly used vegetation sampling designs that are poorly
   suited for monitoring plant diversity, grazing effects, and exotic plant
   invasions. I then discuss new approaches to surveying and monitoring
   large natural areas such as forests and grasslands. The new approaches
   rely on multi-phase sampling techniques: using two resolutions of
   remotely sensed information, cluster sampling for map accuracy
   assessments, and multi-scale field sampling techniques of multiple
   biological groups.
   The protection of forest biodiversity relies on our ability to: (1)
   rapidly assess hot spots of biodiversity and areas of unique species
   assemblages at landscape scales; (2) quantify and predict spatial and
   temporal trends of key species; (3) maintain natural disturbance regimes
   and key ecological professes; (4) prevent detrimental effects of exotic
   species; and (5) limit harmful human activities. Our challenges in North
   America land the world) are to: (1) develop and test various design
   strategies (optimum sampling strategy) and multiple-scale field methods
   for inventorying and monitoring multiple biological groups and ecosystem
   processes; (2) conduct standardized monitoring of key indicators of
   multiple stresses to biodiversity, and (3) develop better mapping,
   information management, and predictive modeling capabilities at multiple
   spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial patterns of settlement and abundance of older life stages were
   examined for three species of damselfish in the genus Dascyllus by
   monitoring natural colonization of standard amounts of initially empty
   juvenile microhabitat (anemones for D. trimaculatus; branching coral for
   D. flavicaudus and D. aruanus) transplanted to a series of sites within
   lagoons of Moorea, French Polynesia. Large spatial differences in larval
   colonization were observed, which were temporally consistent but
   different among the species. At the whole-island scale, D. trimaculatus
   settled primarily on the northern shore, while settlement of the other
   two species was greatest at the southern end. The three species also
   showed different patterns of settlement within lagoons: D. aruanus
   settled mainly nearer to shore, D. flavicaudus primarily on offshore
   lagoon portions and D. trimaculatus colonized equally across the
   lagoons. Among sites around the island, the relative abundance of order
   juveniles after 10 months was a curvilinear function of the relative
   abundance of settlers for two species (D. trimaculatus and D.
   flavicaudus). There was no relationship between patterns of settlement
   and abundance of older juveniles for D. aruanus, although juvenile
   abundance was inversely related to that of juvenile D. flavicaudus. At
   the within-lagoon scale, settlement mirrored almost exactly the relative
   abundance of older lifestages of D. trimaculatus and D. flavicaudus,
   whereas there was just a qualitative match for D. aruanus. A competition
   experiment revealed that juvenile D. flavicaudus had a greater effect on
   population growth of D. aruanus than vice versa, and this mechanism
   helped explain why the modification of settlement patterns was greatest
   in D. aruanus. Interspecific variation in abundance of older stages was
   shaped to differing extents by both patterns of larval delivery and
   subsequent density-dependent processes involving competition for shelter
   space.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored population changes and breeding success of Curlews Numenius
   arquata in a 18 km(2) arable farmland area in southwestern Finland over
   a four-year period (1995-1998). During this time, the breeding
   population decreased from 30 to 23 pairs (23\% decline). The majority of
   breeding failures took place during the incubation (57/84, 68\%), and
   further losses occurred during chick rearing period as a result of which
   only 20\% (17/84) of verified breeding attempts produced fledglings.
   There were 17 pairs (more than half of the breeding population) that
   failed in their breeding attempts every year. The overall reproductive
   success was 0.32 fledglings/pair, which was calculated to be too low to
   maintain a stable population. Nest predation (81\%) and nest losses due
   to agricultural practices (16\%) were the most important reasons for
   failed breeding attempts. We suggest that continual breeding failures
   (especially due to nest predation) may be the most important reason for
   the observed decline of Curlew populations in southern Finland.}},

Abstract = {{Data from 22 seasons were used to analyse the occurrence of Long-tailed
   Tits (Aegithalos caudatus) in relation to the habitat distribution in 26
   one km-squares on the island Aasla in the SW archipelago of Finland. The
   one km-squares most frequently used by Long-tailed Tits had considerably
   higher proportions of deciduous/mixed (all species) and alder forest,
   whereas the number of habitat patches in the km-squares were less
   correlated to bird occurrences. A threshold for the frequent presence of
   Long-tailed Tits showed at 15-20\% deciduous/mixed forest in km-squares
   in a logistic regression model, which agrees with the level suggested
   from a study in a Swedish landscape where the total proportion of
   deciduous/mixed forest was much lower. Further, the occurrence pattern
   of Long-tailed Tits over time suggested a density dependent
   relationship. The six km-squares occupied in low density seasons had a
   mean proportion of deciduous/mixed forest twice as high and a mean
   proportion of alder forest three times as high as the 20 others.
   Long-tailed Tits were also present in these six km-squares in all
   seasons with higher population densities, as predicted by a density
   dependent habitat selection. The importance of long-term monitoring,
   scale considerations and the use of population densities for habitat or
   landscape assessments are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Malagasy chameleons are threatened by the relentless pace of habitat
   destruction. Their great popularity amongst herpetoculturalists has also
   resulted in collection for international animal markets. Most previous
   fieldwork has focused on the compilation of much needed species
   inventories, but little attention has been given to estimating chameleon
   population densities. This lack of information prevents a reliable
   assessment of the effects of habitat loss and direct exploitation on
   wild populations. A simple and repeatable methodology for the monitoring
   of chameleon populations is therefore urgently required. The present
   study developed sun ey techniques based on distance sampling within an
   area of relatively undisturbed rain forest at Ranomafana National Park.
   In total 394 individuals from six species were recorded and population
   densities (+/- SE) of 27.2 +/- 5.4/ha Brookesia spp and 21.4 +/- 4.0/ha
   Calumma spp. were estimated using the computer program DISTANCE. The
   authors propose that monitoring of chameleons in areas subject to
   different threats should begin immediately using the methods outlined in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{To measure the level of replication needed to detect changes in arboreal
   arthropods, a data set based on the arthropod faunas of 26 replicate
   trees of the species Melaleuca linariifolia was analysed. Analysis
   showed that the number of species, individuals per tree and Chao 1
   estimation of species per tree were not normally distributed and that
   this was best corrected by using log transformed data. It was found that
   20 replicates were needed to detect a 23\% change in the observed number
   of species per tree in the study population. The estimation of the ct
   diversity index and the Chao 1 estimation of the number of species per
   tree required even larger numbers of replicates for the same precision.
   Detecting changes in the evenness of diversity, measured as Simpson's D
   or equitability E, also required large numbers of replicates.
   In practice, more replication than that suggested by this study will be
   needed as many relevant sources of increase in variance, for example
   time and location, were avoided and this almost certainty reduced the
   standard deviation between trees. It is clear that further exploration
   of the measurement of species level biological diversity Is urgently
   needed. For the present, richness, evenness and the number of
   individuals which are independent of one another, should all be reported
   in biodiversity studies.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that host plants exert selection pressure on Heterodera
   schachtii populations was tested. Host selection of genotypes from three
   genetically distinct isolates of H. schachtii was assessed using
   cabbage, sugar beet, oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus), and white
   mustard (Sinapis alba). The plants represent a range of susceptibility
   to H. schachtii and included R. sativus and S. alba, because cultivars
   of those species have been used as trap crops for H. schachtii in
   Europe. Genotypic differences in amplified fragment length polymorphism
   (AFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were detected
   among the isolates after they reproduced on the different hosts. The
   poorest host plant, R. sativus, resulted in the greatest number of
   changes in both AFLP and RAPD markers. Oilseed radish selected nematode
   genotypes in less than four nematode generations. The nematode
   population genotypes detected by RAPD analyses after selection on
   oilseed radish were observed even after nematode populations were
   transferred back to the other three hosts. The genetic markers that were
   detected after selection were influenced by the genotypes of the
   original nematode isolates. The results indicate the utility of RAPDs
   and AFLPs for identifying and monitoring intraspecific genetic
   variability in nematodes and for understanding nematode population
   responses to host plants. Nematode management practices such as using
   resistant cultivars may alter gene frequencies, thereby reducing the
   efficacy of the tactic and exacerbating the nematode's potential to
   damage subsequent crops.}},

Abstract = {{Both laboratory and field research have shown that phytoremediation can
   be effective for treating contaminated soils, but we cannot yet
   confidently predict success. A trade-off inherent in using
   phytoremediation is that, although it is inexpensive to implement and
   maintain, it takes longer than traditional treatments. Acceptance of
   phytoremediation has been hindered because of the longer treatment times
   and the uncertainty of achievable rates and endpoints. If a requirement
   for using phytoremediation is spatially and temporally intense
   monitoring, much of the inherent cost savings are negated. Although we
   are gaining experience in using phytoremediation at a number of sites,
   we remain somewhat limited in our ability to effectively predict
   success. The operative mechanisms for phytoremediation are largely
   contaminant dependent. For many organic contaminants, the accepted
   phytoremediation mechanism is enhanced microbial activity and altered
   microbial community structure in the rhizosphere, which in turn enhances
   degradation of contaminants. We hypothesized that a potential tool for
   predicting long-term success and monitoring endpoints of
   phytoremediation could be based on changes in the soil microbiology.
   At a site in Fairbanks, Alaska, we compared the effects of vegetation
   and nutrient additions on remediating both diesel- and
   crude-oil-contaminated soils in a factorial experiment with appropriate
   control treatments. We sampled periodically and measured changes in
   petroleum concentrations. Concomitantly, we characterized the microbial
   populations by species richness-a diversity index. We used fatty acid
   methyl ester (FAME) profiles to identify bacterial isolates fi om the
   soils. The most effective treatment for reducing petroleum
   concentrations, vegetation with nutrient additions, was also
   characterized by differences in the bacterial species richness compared
   to the control treatment. In both treatments, there was an increase in
   bacterial species richness as contaminant concentrations decreased, but
   species richness and remediation were greatest in the vegetation and
   nutrient treatment in the diesel-contaminated soil. Bacterial species
   richness in the crude-oil contaminated soil was both more constant and
   lower than in the diesel-contaminated soil. During the study, the TPH
   concentrations in the crude-oil contaminated soil did not decrease as
   rapidly or to the same extent as that in the diesel-contaminated soil.
   An improved understanding of the time-dependent relationships between
   contaminant concentration changes and microbial community changes,
   coupled with improved techniques to readily characterize microbial
   communities, may provide a useful tool for monitoring the functioning of
   phytoremediation, evaluating desirable endpoints, or both.}},

Abstract = {{Soil nematode communities have the potential to provide unique insights
   into many aspects of soil processes. Since most nematodes are active in
   soil throughout the year, they can potentially provide a holistic
   measure of the biotic and functional status of soils. In contrast to
   other soil microbial groups, representative samples of soil nematode
   communities are relatively easy to obtain. However, most current
   nematode ecological information has been survey-based or purely
   observational in nature, with a persistent focus on detailed taxonomic
   analysis of nematode communities. The development of a Maturity Index,
   MI, represents a significant advance in classifying communities and it
   continues to be refined and developed. But, to develop a wide capacity
   to use soil nematode information for diagnostic and predictive purposes,
   particularly for agricultural soils, we need a new, more robust
   approach, which does not require extensive taxonomic skill and includes
   more functional criteria. One of the key attributes of nematodes is the
   relationship between structural form (principally oesophagal feeding
   apparatus) and function (i.e. trophic group). Nematode form is readily
   determinable by direct observation of extracted nematodes and high-level
   taxonomic skills are not needed to assign the major community components
   to their different trophic and ecological groups. Consequently, the
   trophic structure of nematode communities is relatively easy to
   determine and can provide an integrated measure of the status of the
   other groups on which they feed. Similarly, population numbers and
   proportions of juveniles and adults can be readily determined,
   permitting calculation of relative biomass and dynamics of population
   growth. The size distribution of individuals within the community is
   likely also to be an indicator of the structural status of soils from a
   biotic standpoint. However, fundamental gaps remain in our understanding
   which limit our ability to relate differences in nematode communities to
   functional differences. There needs to be a greater emphasis on the
   development and experimental testing of hypotheses, a greater
   integration of nematology into soil-process related studies, and the
   development of a specific, soil-nematode related theoretical framework
   for understanding epidemiological and soil colonisation processes.}},

Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},

Pages = {{307-319}},
Abstract = {{A portion of nitrate (NO3-), a final breakdown product of nitrogen (N)
   fertilizers, applied to soils and/or that produced upon decomposition of
   organic residues in soils may leach into groundwater. Nitrate levels in
   water excess of 10 mg L-1 (NO3-N) are undesirable as per drinking water
   quality standards. Nitrate concentrations in surficial groundwater can
   vary substantially within an area of citrus grove which receives uniform
   N rate and irrigation management practice. Therefore, differences in
   localized conditions which can contribute to variations in gaseous loss
   of NO3- in the vadose zone and in the surficial aquifer can affect
   differential concentrations of NO3-N in the groundwater at different
   points of sampling. The denitrification capacity and potential in a
   shallow vadose zone soil and in surficial groundwater were studied in
   two large blocks of a citrus grove of `Valencia' orange trees (Citrus
   sinensis (L.) Obs.) on Rough lemon rootstock ( Citrus jambhiri (L.))
   under a uniform N rate and irrigation program. The NO3-N concentration
   in the surficial groundwater sampled from four monitoring wells (MW)
   within each block varied from 5.5- to 6.6-fold. Soil samples were
   collected from 0 to 30, 30 to 90, or 90 to 150 cm depths, and from the
   soil/groundwater interface (SGWI). Groundwater samples from the
   monitoring wells (MW) were collected prior to purging (stagnant water)
   and after purging five well volumes. Without the addition of either C or
   N, the denitrification capacity ranged from 0.5 to 1.53, and from 0.0 to
   2.25 mg N2O-N kg(-1) soil at the surface soil and at the
   soil/groundwater interface, respectively. The denitrification potential
   increased by 100-fold with the addition of 200 mg kg(-1) each of N and
   C. The denitrification potential in the groundwater also followed a
   pattern similar to that for the soil samples. Denitrification potential
   in the soil or in the groundwater was greatest near the monitor well
   with shallow depth of vadose zone (MW3). Cumulative N2O-N emission
   (denitrification capacity) from the SGWI soil samples and from stagnant
   water samples strongly correlated to microbial most probable number
   (MPN) counts (r(2) = 0.84 - 0.89), and dissolved organic C (DOC) (r(2) =
   0.96 - 0.97). Denitrification capacity of the SGWI samples moderately
   correlated to water-filled pore space (WFPS) (r(2) = 0.52). However,
   extractable NO3-N content of the SGWI soil samples poorly (negative)
   correlated to denitrification capacity (r(2) = 0.35). However, addition
   C, N or both to the soil or water samples resulted in significant
   increase in cumulative N2O emission. This study demonstrated that
   variation in denitrification capacity, as a result of differences in
   denitrifier population, and the amount of readily available carbon
   source significantly (at 95\% probability level) influenced the
   variation in NO3-N concentrations in the surficial groundwater samples
   collected from different monitoring wells within an area with uniform N
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Isolates of Venturia inaequalis were sampled from apple orchards during
   1990 to 1996 and isolate sensitivities to dodine were determined by
   testing the relative growth (RG) of mycelial colonies at a
   discriminatory dose of 0.2 mu g ml(-1). Sensitivities were not
   significantly different for a wild-type population and several
   populations sampled from orchards never or rarely treated with dodine,
   and respective data were combined to provide a reference for baseline
   populations. The baseline sensitivity was compared with sensitivities
   determined for four orchards with evidence for practical dodine
   resistance. At these sites, increases of phenotype frequencies were most
   pronounced for isolates with RG values >90; they had increased from a
   baseline level of 0.9 to >30\% and, therefore, were rated
   dodine-resistant. For two orchards with confirmed cases of previous
   dodine resistance, frequencies of resistant isolates had declined to 11
   and 14\% after dodine use was discontinued for 13 and 4 years,
   respectively. Sensitivities had not returned to baseline levels, and
   indirect evidence suggested that practical dodine resistance could recur
   rapidly in response to resumed dodine usage. Monitoring of commercial
   orchards in New York and Michigan revealed that dodine sensitivities
   were not uniform throughout regions where dodine resistance was
   widespread in the late 1970s. Sensitivities ranged from baseline to
   dodine-resistant and appeared to reflect the dodine use history at
   particular sites. Because the history of dodine use is not always known
   to growers, applications of dodine remain risky when accurate historical
   records are not available.}},

Title = {{Developing tests of successional hypotheses with size-structured
   populations, and an assessment using long-term data from a Ugandan rain

Abstract = {{In 1947, W. J. Eggeling published an account of forest succession at
   Budongo, Uganda. This interpretation was based on a large-scale
   comparative plot study, performed in the 1930s and 1940s. This account,
   with its implication that species richness declines in late succession,
   endures as a controversial corner-stone in theories and disputes about
   community diversity. Data have now been collected over six decades from
   five of Eggeling's original plots.
   This paper evaluates Eggeling's successional interpretation of the
   Budongo vegetation. The first set of analyses assesses the consistency
   of the original data with the predictions of compositional progression
   and convergence implicit in Eggeling's model. The second analyses do the
   same for the time-series observations. A logical approach shows how
   temporal information may be derived from both between plot, and within
   plot, evaluations using size-structured data. A
   Detrended-Correspondence-Analysis (DCA) of canopy-tree composition, from
   the original data, ranks the plots in perfect correspondence to
   Eggeling's successional sequence. A `development-scoring' procedure is
   developed using passive-ordination against this sequence; this is then
   applied to composition by plot and stem-size class.
   Eggeling's original data are consistent with each prediction assessed.
   The analyses show compositional progression and apparent convergence
   across the plot series, and also progression and convergence within each
   plot. A monodominant-Cynometra forest is the natural end-point of this
   progression. The time-series results, though in apparent agreement for
   one early successional plot, do not generally accord with Eggeling's
   ideas. The analyses illustrate a general means for evaluating explicit
   and implicit compositional trends in communities with structured
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the estuarine fishes of the Tha-Chin River in the Gulf of
   Thailand near Bangkok was carried out in May and July 1997 using a
   bamboo beam net (6.5 m wide, 16.0 m long and 1.5 cm codend). Abiotic
   factors including depth, temperature, salinity, pH and distance from
   shoreline were recorded. As a result, 55 species of fish were obtained
   from 7 stations (both day and night collections), representing 39 genera
   and 26 families. Most of the fishes were relatively small and immature.
   The most abundant species were Ambassis gymnocephala (Ambassidae) in
   number and Eleutheronema tetradactylum (Polynemidae) in biomass. Slight
   differences were observed in fish diversity between night and day
   collections. Several species are economically important, e.g.,
   Stolephorus commersonii and Mugil subviridis. The recent development of
   human activities (pollution, urbanization, shrimp farming) caused the
   reduction of the mangrove areas and consequently that of the fish
   populations.}},

   size on poult survival. Poult survival to 21 days posthatch averaged
   0.203 (SE=0.05) during 1992 and 0.418 (SE=0.11) during 1993 (T= 1.37. P
   >0.10). No correlations were detected (P greater than or equal to0.10)
   between macrohabitat and forest cover type variables and poult survival.
   Poult survival was correlated with the percentage of brood habitat
   composed of herbaceous understory vegetation (P=0.058). Poult survival
   was also examined in relation to a simple brood habitat classification
   system. however, no correlations were detected (P greater than or equal

Abstract = {{To study the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) in the
   mountains of Virginia. wt: monitored 349 nest boxes at 26 sites from
   October 1985 to May 1996. The northern flying squirrel was captured 112
   times at 6 of these sites. 78 individuals were ear-tagged. Il neonates
   were not ear-tagged, and 6 escaped. Twelve northern flying squirrels
   were recaptured at least once. Most of the individuals (84.8\%) were
   captured at 3 sites in Grayson and Smyth counties. The remaining
   individuals were captured at a fourth site in Grayson County and 2 sites
   in Highland County. The northern flying squirrel is now documented from
   7 sites in 3 Virginia counties. The northern flying squirrel occupied 28
   of the 349 nest boxes. The mean number of squirrels/occupied box was 2.1
   (range= 1-5). The sex ratio of adult squirrels was 1.4 males/female. The
   juvenile to adult female ratio was 1.2 young/adult female during the
   breeding season. Eleven litters were observed between 1987 and 1994 and
   mean litter size was 2.5 (range=1-4). Mean body mass of adult males and
   adult females was 109.8 g (range=93-126) and 170.6 g (range=98-141),
   respectively. Reproductive activity was first recorded in December for
   males and in March for females. Mean tail length for squirrels in
   Grayson and Smyth counties was 128.3 mm. suggesting this population is
   more closely related to G. s. colorarus than to G. s. fuscus.}},

Abstract = {{Squirrels (Sciuris spp.) are important game species: however, it is
   believed that southern fox squirrel(S. niger) populations in many
   regions are declining. Changes in forest management practices may have
   reduced habitat availability and diversity, thereby contributing to
   declining population trends. However, relationships among forest
   management practices, active management of wildlife habitats, and
   wildlife populations requires an understanding of relationships among
   forest communities and wildlife populations. We used linear regression
   to build predictive models of gray squirrel (S. carolinensis) and fox
   squirrel relative abundance based on winter and summer habitat
   conditions. Relative abundance of gray squirrels was greatest in older
   hardwood stands containing high basal areas. regardless of season.
   Southern fox squirrel abundance also was correlated with percentage
   hardwood, indicating the importance of the hardwood component to
   southern fox squirrels. Our data suggest that the hardwood component
   within mixed and pine-dominated stands is an important cue for habitat
   selection by southern fox squirrels and should be monitored when
   managing for sustainable populations of southern fox and gray squirrels.}},

Abstract = {{Water uptake of Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts was measured after
   transfer into hypo-osmotic conditions. The time-dependent swelling of
   protoplast populations was monitored by a Coulter counter device. In
   order to ascertain the contribution of the plasma membrane intrinsic
   protein 1b (PIP1b) to the membrane's water permeability, protoplasts of
   five different plant lines that were transformed with a PIP1b antisense
   construct were compared to controls. The size distribution of 5
   independent protoplast preparations provided similar results for control
   and antisense lines under iso-osmolar conditions. After transfer into
   hypo-osmotic conditions, a time difference for the swelling of
   protoplasts from the different sources was observed. The sizes of
   control protoplasts changed in less than 20 s, which indicates high
   water influx rates. In contrast, the protoplast populations obtained
   from 5 different antisense plants look about 75 s to reach a
   steady-slate cell size distribution. The difference in time by a factor
   of about 3 confirms the significance of the aquaporin PIP1b for the
   water permeability of plant plasma membranes and the cellular water
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{For the purposes of dose limitation and dose control, the harm, or
   detriment, of exposure to radiation is assessed by the quantity
   effective dose. Effective dose is evaluated by the application of
   factors to the averaged absorbed dose in the organs and tissues of the
   body. Radiation monitoring instruments are generally calibrated in terms
   of the quantity ambient dose equivalent which is defined in a simple
   spherical phantom. The relationship of these quantities is described.
   Requirements for the radiation protection of aircraft crew are given in
   the European Union Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM. There are
   requirements to assess the exposure of aircraft crew, to inform them of
   health risks, to reduce higher doses, and to control the dose to the
   fetus. There are no explicit dose limits, other than a dose objective to
   be applied to the exposure of the fetus, and no requirements for
   designation of areas or classification of workers. There are significant
   differences between the exposure condition of aircraft crew and workers
   in most other industries where there is occupational exposure to
   radiation. There are greater ranges of radiation types and energy, and
   there rue different dose distributions and characteristics of the
   working populations. However, the field intensity is predictable and,
   with the exception of rare solar events, there is no risk of significant
   unexpected exposures. Dose assessment is anticipated to be by folding
   staff roster information with estimates of route doses, since there is
   little variability of dose rate within an aircraft. Route doses, which
   may be either an agreed average value for a given airport pairing and
   aircraft type, or be flight specific, will be closely linked to measured
   values. Requirements as to the accuracy of dose assessment should be
   applied which are broadly similar to those used in individual monitoring
   generally.}},

Abstract = {{To provide instrumental validation of radioecological dosimetric models
   used for estimation of external doses to the Chernobyl population, about
   1000 direct dose measurements were conducted in 1996-1997 in 54
   settlements in contaminated territories of Ukraine. The areas covered by
   the measurements have Cs-137 contamination density ranging from 55 to
   491 kBq.m(-2) Individual dose measurements were conducted using standard
   LiF dosemeters, type Harshaw 8814 (TLD-100), and automated TLD system
   Harshaw 8800. Relatively low contamination and, thus, an unfavourable
   `Chernobyl/natural background' dose ratio, called for sophisticated
   analysis of experimental results. Linear regression of dose relative to
   Cs-137 contamination density which was conducted in two different ways
   provided consistent results. Annual background dose, as derived from the
   results of individual dose measurements, is about 1.1 mSv per annum; the
   Chernobyl related component is expressed by the rate of 1.24-1.3 mu Sv
   per kBq.m(-2) per annum. These results are in reasonable agreement with
   somewhat conservative modelling parameters which are assumed to be 1.91
   mu Sv per kBq.m(-2) per annum for the case of the rural population.}},

Abstract = {{Brown trout (Salmo trutta) were sampled from tributaries of Glomma, the
   largest river system in Norway. Brown trout were formerly known to
   migrate long distances, but several dams and river regulations have made
   migration difficult, as fishways constructed at the dams are not
   efficient. To compensate for the resultant reduction in brown trout, the
   river system has been stocked with hatchery fish reared from native
   brown trout.
   Genetic analysis by enzyme electrophoresis was conducted to monitor
   possible genetic effects on native fish. Brown trout were obtained from
   a fishway at Lopet in the South Rena River, and from a section at Deset,
   16 km upstream of the fishway. One sample was taken from a cohort of
   first generation hatchery fish, based on only six spawning fish
   collected in the fishway, and one sample was taken from the second
   hatchery generation, bred from a mixture of two cohorts of first
   generation hatchery fish. The pooled broodstock of these two first
   generation cohorts numbered five females and five males. Eight samples
   were taken from second-, third- and fourth-order streams containing
   populations differing in size and degree of isolation.
   Tissue samples taken from eye, liver and muscle were analyzed using
   starch gel electrophoresis for protein polymorphism to determine genetic
   population structures. Allele frequencies, heterozygosity and
   polymorphism were compared. The fraction of heterozygosity ranged from
   3.3 to 13.5\% in the wild populations, and the lowest fraction was found
   in the most isolated population. Heterozygosity was 8.0\% in the first
   generation of hatchery reared fish and 7.3\% in the second generation.
   The number of detected polymorphic loci ranged from one to seven, with a
   mean of 4.5, in wild populations, but was three in the first generation
   and four in the second generation of hatchery fish. Polymorphism seemed
   to be lost at three loci in the first generation, but one locus was
   restored in the second generation, probably due to breeding with another
   hatchery cohort. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is known that ram spermatozoa exhibit hyperactivated
   motility under capacitating conditions, quantitative analyses of the
   head and flagellar movement of washed ram spermatozoa have not been
   published. Motile spermatozoa were recovered from semen by swim-up into
   HSOF medium, and their movement in 30-mu m-deep chambers was
   videorecorded. Spermatozoa of interest were identified during tape
   playback (hyperactivated spermatozoa were identified by visual
   assessment of flagellar movement) and sequential head and tail images
   were traced onto overhead projector film attached to the video monitor.
   The flagellar movement characteristics beat angle (FBA), beat envelope
   (FBE) and curvature ratio (FCR) were determined by first principles, and
   head centroid kinematics were determined using Cartesian methods.
   Hyperactivated spermatozoa had significantly higher FBA and FEE and
   significantly lower FCR values than non-hyperactivated spermatozoa (all
   P < 0.0001). The centroid kinematic values were also found to be
   significantly different, and kinematic criteria for ram sperm
   hyperactivation were developed. These criteria were refined by
   consideration of 60-Hz CASA-derived trajectories, and ram sperm
   hyperactivation was defined by: VCL > 250.0 mu m s(-1) and VSL less than
   or equal to 100.0 mu m s(-1) and LIN less than or equal to 30\% and
   ALHmax greater than or equal to 9.0 mu m.}},

Pages = {{167-173}},
Abstract = {{Studies were conducted on chital deer hinds (Axis axis) living in a
   temperate region to advance the understanding of the patterns of
   reproduction of a tropical cervid species. The hinds exhibited regular
   patterns of oestrus cyclicity throughout the year as evidenced by
   concentrations of serum progesterone monitored over a 14-month period,
   and detection of behavioural oestrus by vasectomized stags, The mean
   length of the oestrous cycle was 18.0 +/- 0.7 days (range, 12-23 days).
   Profiles of serum progesterone showed concentrations of <0.5 ng mL(-1)
   at the time of oestrus, which rose to a peak (range 1.5-5.0 ng mL(-1))
   about Day 13, and then declined to low concentrations at the next
   oestrus. Observations following parturition showed that the first
   detected oestrus occurred at a mean (+/- SEM) time of 26.9 +/- 3.0 days
   later for seven of nine hinds. The mean length of the oestrous cycle
   after the first post-partum oestrus was 16.6 +/- 1.0 days (range 7-20
   days); The presence of a stag may influence the length of the
   post-partum period in chital deer hinds, and hinds in contact with a
   stag in this study had a significantly shorter interval from parturition
   to first ovulation (P<0.01) compared with hinds not in contact with a
   stag. By 7 weeks post partum a corpus luteum was detected in 93\% of
   hinds, In comparison only 43\% of hinds with no stag contact had a
   corpus luteum by 7 weeks post partum. It is suggested that the tendency
   towards seasonal calving in the study population may be related more to
   male than female factors.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995 and 1996 we conducted point count surveys and nest searches to
   examine the need to manage Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater)
   populations in eight western national parks. Our goal was to examine
   what impact, if any, Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism was having on
   passerines in the parks, and how current management practices might be
   affecting cowbird activity. The parks selected for this study were:
   Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Great Basin National Park, Lake
   Mead National Recreation Area, Montezuma Castle National Monument, Organ
   Pipe Cactus National Monument, Point Reyes National Seashore,
   Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks, and Yosemite National Park. We
   located and monitored 1295 nests of potential cowbird hosts. Parasitism
   had a significant impact on host reproduction in four of the eight
   parks: Golden Gate, Great Basin, Lake Mead, and Montezuma Castle. All of
   the parks had some form of livestock within or adjacent to their
   boundaries (cattle or horses), and proximity to grazing was
   significantly correlated with parasitism rates.}},

Abstract = {{The Least Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus) is an obligate riparian
   breeder brought to the brink of extinction in the last 50 years by
   habitat loss and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism.
   Although cowbird removal programs have effectively reversed the species'
   decline and promoted a rangewide population rebound, limitations on the
   timing, duration, location, and scope of trapping efforts permit
   parasitism to continue in some vireo populations. We quantified the
   impact of cowbirds on vireo productivity during a 9-yr study of one such
   population at the San Luis Rey River, California, where trapping of
   adults and removal of cowbird eggs from vireo nests were conducted
   annually to control parasitism. Cowbird parasitism occurred in every
   year of the study, and extended throughout the entire breeding season
   (April-August). Nineteen to 43\% of nests (N = 667), and 19-56\% of
   pairs (25-66), were parasitized at least once during a given year. On
   average, 29\% of parasitized nests (N = 207) were abandoned before
   cowbird eggs could be removed, and parasitism was responsible for up to
   29\% of all nest failures. Of 139 nests from which cowbird eggs were
   removed, 99\% remained active, and half eventually fledged vireo young.
   However, reduced clutch size and hatch rate in these ``rescued{''} nests
   resulted in the production of up to four times fewer young per nest, and
   half as many young per egg, than non-parasitized nests. Nevertheless,
   nest monitoring and cowbird egg removal enhanced annual productivity by
   11-44\% over that expected in the absence of monitoring and removal.
   While monitoring and egg removal are effective tools in reducing impacts
   of parasitized nests, it is essential that appropriate trapping protocol
   be implemented to prevent access of cowbirds to nests and thus eliminate
   the impacts that monitoring cannot control. Long-term plans for
   management of cowbirds and their hosts should emphasize controlling
   landscape level factors influencing cowbird abundance as opposed to
   reliance solely on localized trapping programs.}},

Abstract = {{Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were trapped on the:Cleveland
   National Forest from 1992 to 1997 in an attempt to increase the
   reproductive success of the endangered Least Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii

   extimus) on National Forest lands. Over this time period the flycatcher
   population has been stable, while two of three vireo populations have
   declined. We postulate that the remote locations of vireo populations
   made cowbird trapping an ineffective tool for reducing the impact,of
   brood parasitism. The lack of road and trail access to these areas
   limits both the number of traps that can be employed and the selection
   of trap locations. Where these conditions exist, our data suggest that
   nest monitoring and cowbird egg removal may be more effective and less
   costly than cowbird trapping.}},

Abstract = {{The Afrotropical Varanus niloticus is subdivided in two distinct
   subspecies which are morphologically easily recognizable from each
   other. Boehme \& Ziegler (1997) concluded that these two forms have
   markedly surpassed the subspecific level and have to be neared as
   distinct species, the one typical of savannas (K niloticus) and the
   other of rainforest biota (V. ornatus). These authors also reported on
   the sympatric occurrence (without hybridization and intergradation) of
   both the forms in the Niger Delta (southeastern Nigeria), which is a
   further demonstration of the specific status of these taxa.
   We studied the ecology of monitor lizards in southeastern Nigeria
   between September 1996 and July 1998. Including both free-living and
   dead specimens offered in local bush-meat markets, we determined the
   taxonomic status of several dozens of monitor lizards, ail were typical
   ornatus. Ornatus specimens were observed not only in forest biota, but
   also in derived savannas and cultivated lands of southeastern Nigeria
   and of the Lagos state, where the two forms were said to coexist. Thus,
   as far as southern Nigeria is concerned, the coexistence of these two
   Varanus ``species{''} is still in doubt. In general, Nigerian ornatus
   proved to be habitat generalists, but they were found mainly in
   secondary swamp forests and along riverine forests. Nigerian ornatus did
   not show any aestivation phase, contrary to niloticus from other African
   countries. There was evidence of a strong reproductive seasonality in
   these lizards. Main food of Nigerian ornatus were crabs, a very abundant
   food resource in the environment. About 10\% of the total number of prey
   items were vertebrates. Food niche breadth of adults was wider than that
   of juveniles. Some general implications of the presented ecological data
   for the evolutionary history of Varanus niloticus species complex are
   discussed. In addition, some data on the relationships between monitor
   lizards and local human populations are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive regulation of the Middle Rio Grande's natural flow regime,
   together with the effects of introduced tree species, landscape
   fragmentation, and increasing wildfires, are obstacles for any level of
   restoration of its native riparian forest (bosque). However, carefully
   monitored partial restoration is possible and greatly needed to prevent
   the bosque's serious decline. Monitoring can reveal temporal and spatial
   changes in the bosque's ecological dynamics. The Bosque Ecosystem
   Monitoring Program, which currently uses volunteers to synchronously
   record changes in biological populations and ecological processes at
   four sites in the middle valley, shows how this can he done. Partial
   restoration depends on well timed releases following heavy spring
   runoff. When these exceed bankfull stage, overbank flooding will (1)
   establish new cottonwood-willow stands at suitable locations and (2)
   enhance ecological maintenance of mature stands. Partial restoration can
   potentially involve alternative, non mutually exclusive manipulations of
   the river's hydrology within a given reach. A different approach,
   currently exemplified by the Albuquerque Overbank Project, involves
   lowering a bank so that natural flooding can establish new native
   vegetation. These conceptual and empirical efforts can build a
   foundation for bosque managers to assess where modified native bosque
   can persist, and can be the beginning of a comprehensive program to
   manage the riparian forest on a sustainable basis.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated surface management techniques for pipeline construction
   through arid and semi-arid rangeland ecosystems are presented in a case
   history of a 412-mile pipeline construction project in New Mexico.
   Planning, implementation and monitoring for restoration of surface
   hydrology, soil stabilization, soil cover, and plant species succession
   are discussed. Planning phases included baseline survey for native plant
   community composition and noxious weed populations, seed mixture design,
   critical area identification, construction specifications for seeding,
   weed control and erosion controls, and information meetings.
   Implementation phases included daily inspection of equipment, seed
   quality and quantity, planting, mulch cover and anchoring, erosion
   control blankets,water diversion structures, and arroyo stabilization
   structures. Monitoring commitments for seeding success, noxious weed
   spread, and condition of erosion controls on public land were
   established for three years following project completion. Two years of
   noxious weed monitoring showed that most noxious weed populations appear
   to have been contained by project-specific weed management. One
   Population of halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus) was contained after the
   first year but increased in area after the second year. Monitoring of
   seeding success will occur in a one-time assessment three growing
   seasons after completed seeding (1998).}},

Abstract = {{Two locations were chosen during dry and wet seasons, in Western Saudi
   Arabia, during 1996 and 1997 to monitor field populations of the
   harvester termite Anacanthotermes ochraceus (Burmeister). Data showed
   that the activities of this termite increased significantly during and
   after the rainy season, Chi-square (chi(2)) analysis showed that the
   population of A, ochraceus during dry and wet seasons were significantly
   related (P<0.001), The minimum and maximum nest size in the first
   location, Dallah Tower, during dry and wet seasons, ranges from 57cm(3)
   to 4253cm(3) with an average of 1068cm(3) and from 340cm(3) to 9188cm(3)
   with an average of 1068cm3, respectively, whereas in the 2nd location,

   average of 717cm(3) and from 355cm(3) to 5988cm(3) with an average
   1756cm(3), respectively. Nests monitored showed more activity and an

Abstract = {{We conducted the first extensive population genetics study of sympatric
   subterranean termite populations of the genus Reticulitermes (Isoptera:
   Rhinotermitidae) in which maternal gene flow across a large and varied
   geography was examined. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was chosen as a
   molecular marker because each termite colony is founded by a single
   diploid pair to whom all progeny are related. Each colony, therefore,
   carries the unique mtDNA of the foundress. Also, gene dispersion is
   limited to swarming or budding, neither of which results in long
   distance dispersion. Intra- and interspecific population subdivision was
   expected, therefore, to be geographically localized with colonies
   related by distance: the closer the more related. Species used in the
   study, Reticulitermes flavipes and R. virginicus, are sympatric and
   continuously distributed throughout the state of Georgia, U.S.A., a
   large and geographically diverse area. Further, colony sites cover four
   soil provinces and most have been regularly monitored for at least three
   years. Seventy-eight individuals were sampled from 21 Georgia colony
   sites and one Canadian colony site for comparison. Amplified mtDNA
   fragments were sequenced from each individual in both directions.
   Phylogenetic relationships were then inferred using cladistic and
   phenetic methods. Both methods differentiated species but demonstrated
   low levels of molecular divergence among R. flavipes populations.
   Lineages were, therefore, difficult to resolve for this species.
   Reticulitermes flavipes and R. virginicus populations were also
   significantly different genetically according to the Hudson, Boos and
   Kaplan (HBK) statistic, R. flavipes geographic populations, however,
   were not. Assumptions of intraspecific relatedness, therefore, cannot be
   based on geographic locations in Georgia as expected.}},

Abstract = {{The South African pelagic resources have been monitored acoustically
   since 1983. The results of these surveys are currently used to determine
   catch limits for anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax.
   Two main surveys are conducted annually, in winter to determine the
   strength of the year's recruitment and in summer to estimate the size of
   the adult stock. The results of the surveys conducted between 1990 and
   1997 are presented and discussed in the context of the time-series of
   stock abundance. Distribution patterns, size structure and biomass
   levels are related to general trends in the life-history strategies of
   anchovy and sardine, as well as the major environmental features in the
   southern Benguela in the 1990s. The biomass of adult anchovy appears to
   be driven largely by the strength of the early recruitment,
   corresponding to fish spawned in the first half of the summer spawning
   season. The biomass of adult sardine, however, is better explained on
   the basis of the biomass of 2-year-old and older fish in the previous
   year's survey. Anchovy tend to move east with age, whereas sardine
   appear to move both north, along the south African west coast, and east
   with increasing age.}},

Abstract = {{Coral reefs support great biological diversity, which has been equated
   with ecosystem stability and strong interactions (e.g. competition,
   predation) among species, making them poor candidates for stock
   enhancement. Sustained monitoring of reef fish dynamics and large-scale
   natural experiments suggest otherwise; lessons that can be extended
   logically to other systems. Under normal circumstances, natural
   variations in recruitment modify patterns of abundance and demography.
   Post-settlement predation provides imperfect compensation for variable
   replenishment, and the persistence of dominant cohorts in populations
   suggests that numerical density dependence is limited to juveniles.
   Following major disturbances that result in expanded resources, the
   densities of specialists show little change, apparently because of
   limiting larval supply.
   Some coral reefs have low larval supply because of poor connectivity
   with other spawning sources. Such units have most potential to benefit
   from sea ranching and they provide natural laboratories for low risk
   trials into stock enhancement. The broad geographical distribution of
   strong cohorts suggests that recruitment limitation may be a chronic
   condition. While this provides a theoretical basis for enhancing most
   reefs and, by analogy, other systems, it is not clear whether the
   stocking costs, particularly `predator swamping', are affordable. Where
   indicated, sea ranching may be more benign ecologically when applied
   selectively within metapopulations than to enhance single-unit stocks.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, the genetic principles which should be observed so as
   to maximize success in enhancement and ranching exercises are first
   considered. The consequences of interactions with wild conspecifics are
   then discussed. The difference in the proportion of genetic variability
   which occurs within and between populations of marine and anadromous
   species is noted. Within-population variability is then discussed with
   regard to collection of wild broodstock, artificial spawning, captive
   rearing and release strategy, all with the objectives of maintaining
   family number and minimizing selection. Optimal molecular monitoring
   methods are described, with the micro- and minisatellite DNA being
   recommended in general, and with mitochondrial DNA being suggested to
   monitor effects of low broodstock numbers. Genetic marking to assess
   survival, using either batch or individual marks, is described, and
   between-population variation is then considered. It is suggested that
   where possible, native populations be used as donors, but a strategy is
   recommended where this is impossible. Improving strain performance by
   selection is described, but it is concluded that caution must be adopted
   in this approach. This cautionary approach is urged with regard to all
   enhancement and ranching exercises, since deliberate releases usually
   result in genetic interaction between reared and wild conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in hatchery technologies, as well as improved ocean rearing
   conditions, have led to a dramatic increase in returns of Japanese chum
   salmon Oncorhynchus keta (Walbaum) and pink salmon O. gorbuscha
   (Walbaum) during the last 20 years. From the 1960s to the 1990s, the
   number of returning adults increased from 5 to 88 million chum salmon
   and 1.2 to 19 million pink salmon. In Hokkaido, return rates, which
   indicate marine survival, reached about 5\% for chum salmon from the
   1991 brood-year and more than 10\% for pink salmon from the 1992
   brood-year. The Japanese salmon hatchery programme is regarded as a
   pioneer in the field of sea ranching. The rapid increase in chum salmon
   abundance, however, may have led to population density-dependent effects
   such as reduction in somatic growth and increase in age at maturity.
   Intensive hatchery activities also reduced genetic diversity and
   resulted in the loss of wild salmonid populations in Japan. For salmonid
   hatchery programmes, therefore, it is extremely important to clarify the
   mechanisms of population regulation such as density-dependent effects
   and carrying capacity, and to monitor the biological characteristics of
   populations such as migration patterns, body size, age composition and
   fecundity, and biological interactions between wild and hatchery
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{From 1990 to 1994, 125 000 microtagged juveniles of European lobster
   (Homarus gammarus (L.)) were released at the islands of Kvitsoy in
   south-western Norway. The juveniles were about 8 months of age, at a
   size of about 14mm carapace length. The monitoring of the commercial
   fishery started in 1991 in close cooperation with local fishermen. The
   landings of lobster increased during the investigated period. Number and
   proportion of cultured lobster in the commercial landings increased as
   well. In autumn 1997, as much as 43\% of the landings were found to have
   been previously released. This number is likely to rise considering that
   in the same season, 73\% of the sub-legal sized lobsters were of
   cultured origin. Further, data on catch per unit effort show that
   cultured lobster represents an addition to wild lobster at Kvitsoy. Of
   the six cohorts released, four have reached catchable sizes. A sample of
   sub-legal sized lobster caught during autumn 1997 showed that all the
   remaining release cohorts were present, thus indicating survival so far.
   Recruitment starts at 3 to 4 years of age, with peak recaptures in the
   fifth and sixth years. Tag loss appears to be high for some release
   groups, and an attempt is made to elucidate this. The highest total
   recovery rate for a single year-class is presently about 8\%. The
   overall conclusion from this large-scale experiment is that enhancement
   of a depleted lobster population is feasible. In order to obtain a
   long-term effect, the necessary fishery regulations must be applied.}},

Abstract = {{A sustained production of fish and shellfish, with the spectacular
   increases of world population, is only possible by increasing the
   aquaculture production. The present aquaculture yield of 26 million
   metric tonnes (mmt) in 1996 must increase to about 55 mmt by the year
   2025 to meet the demand of fishery products. Unfortunately all
   production processes produce wastes as well, which is true also for
   aquaculture. The present paper aims at discussing various technologies
   to restrict the discharge of wastes to the environment. AU
   aquaculturists must consider the complex structure of biological,
   technical and economical factors involved in farming activities when
   choosing production systems to minimize the output of organic material
   and nutrients from open cage culture to surrounding waters or outlets
   from farms on land. The flow-through systems, e.g. an open cage system,
   is usually a comparatively cheap way of producing fish but
   simultaneously it is difficult to reduce wastage from this type of
   technology. In landbased flow-through systems the possibilities to
   collect wastes are easier than open cage systems. In integrated
   aquaculture on the other hand waste itself can be used as fertilizer for
   agriculture farming on land or fish production in ponds. The opposite
   way is also possible to use off-fall from urban areas and landproduction
   to raise fish, shellfish and algae in ponds. The best method to control
   the discharge of wastes is a recycle system on land. In theory 100\% of
   the waste can be collected and used e.g. on farmland. The paper
   discusses the various filter technologies to collect suspendid solids
   and the complex structures of biofilter to transform excreted ammonia
   into nitrite, nitrate and finally nitrogen gas. Implemented improved
   feed technology based on the behaviour of fish, e.g. the feeding
   periodicity, can decrease the amount of waste from aquaculture
   operations. New technology has been designed to reduce fodder spill by
   using hydroacoustic monitoring of fish in cages to regulate food
   administration to the fish. Great progress has been made to improve the
   feed quality and hence minimize the discharge of wastes. The composition
   of feed ingredients in salmonid fodder has changed very much by reducing
   the protein content and increase the lipid content in the feed, which
   reduce the amount of discharged nitrogen to the environment. Various
   system analyses in combination with coastal zone management have
   decreased the environmental contamination of aquaculture operations.}},

   eight major regions(Japan, Russia, northwest Alaska summer run, Yukon
   River fall run, Alaska Peninsula-Kodiak Island, southeast Alaska,

   populations predominated in the fishery with estimates ranging from 0.52

   the Japanese component from the rest of the Pacific Rim stocks was
   assayed in 400 of the 1994 samples. Estimates from the allozyme and

Abstract = {{Spawning migration of adult male chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha
   was monitored by radio telemetry to determine their response to the
   presence of metals contamination in the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene
   River, Idaho. The North Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River is relatively
   free of metals contamination and was used as a control. In all, 45
   chinook salmon were transported from their natal stream, Wolf Lodge
   Creek, tagged with radio transmitters, and released in the Coeur d'Alene
   River 2 km downstream of the confluence of the South Fork and the North
   Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. Fixed telemetry receivers were used to
   monitor the upstream movement of the tagged chinook salmon through the
   confluence area for 3 weeks after release. During this period, general
   water quality and metals concentrations were monitored in the study
   area. Of the 23 chinook salmon observed to move upstream from the
   release site and through the confluence area, the majority (16 fish,
   70\%) moved up the North Fork, and only 7 fish (30\%) moved up the South
   Fork, where greater metals concentrations were observed. Our results
   agree with laboratory findings and suggest that natural fish populations
   will void tributaries with high metals contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Gulf sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi, a subspecies of Atlantic
   sturgeon A. oxyrinchus, were once abundant in coastal rivers of the
   eastern Gulf of Mexico but have declined substantially due to habitat
   loss and overexploitation. Because relatively little is known about
   their population status in the Apalachicola River, Florida, we used
   capture-recapture data collected during 1982-1991 to assess the
   population of Gulf sturgeon at the Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam, which
   limits upstream migration. Wt, estimated that about 100 fish greater
   than 45 cm total length were present below the dam, although the
   estimates were biased to an unknown degree because of violations of
   capture-recapture model assumptions. To obtain a less biased estimate,
   we conducted an intensive 10-week capture-recapture experiment in 1993
   that accounted for most of the assumption violations. We also used
   radiotelemetry to test the assumption that the population remained
   closed to immigration and emigration during sampling. The 1993 results
   also indicated a population of about 100 Gulf sturgeon below the dam;
   however, movement in and out of the sampling area occurred, so the
   population at the dam was not closed. Using simulation, we found that
   Jolly-Seber and Schnabel capture-recapture models were generally
   unbiased when fish had a high probability of returning to the study area
   after temporary emigration. However when fish had a low probability of
   returning to the study area after temporary emigration, substantial bias
   occurred in both models. Length composition data from 1982 to 1991 and
   for 1993 suggested that low recruitment may account for the failure of
   the population to rebuild. We recommend identifying all areas of
   concentration of Gulf sturgeon in the Apalachicola River and developing
   a standardized sampling program for monitoring this threatened species.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1994, we have used Trailmaster(TM) Model TM1500 camera systems to
   monitor mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations and habitat use in
   the central Sierra Nevada. Factory-provided mounts, I-m tall wooden
   stakes, and an infrared pulse length of 0.25 sec (5 pulses) were used
   with the systems during the winters of 1994-95 and 1995-96. We used
   three plywood boxes, 1.5-m tall steel t-posts, and an infrared pulse
   length of 0.75 sec (15 pulses) during the winters of 1996-97 and
   1997-98. Different mounts and pulse settings were used from 1996-1998 to
   minimize problems we encountered with factory mounts, stakes, and
   shorter pulse from 1994-1996. The number of pictures with deer increased
   (P < 0.001), while the number of pictures without deer decreased (P <
   0.001) with the boxes, t-posts, and longer pulse used in 1996-98. The
   boxes and t-posts protected the units from inclement weather, and
   provided a stable platform for die transmitter and receiver. Lengthening
   the pulse made the units less sensitive to rain, snow, and fog and
   leaves, twigs, and vegetation blowing in the wind that might break the
   infrared beam and trigger the camera to take photographs of non-animal
   events.}},

Title = {{Social aspects of public waste management in Switzerland}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{417-425}},
Abstract = {{It is becoming increasingly evident that a waste management program, and
   especially a waste treatment technique, which ignores social aspects, is
   doomed to failure. Aspects concerning the problems of public acceptance,
   public participation in planning and implementation, consumer behaviour
   and changing value systems are no less important than the technical or
   economic aspects in waste management research and decision-making. As
   part of the Integrated Research Project ``Waste{''}, Swiss Priority
   Program Environment (SPPE) 1996-1999 (funded by the Swiss National
   Science Foundation), this sub-project focuses on the results from two
   main areas. 1. Results of the three-round written
   Delphi-Expertquestioning ``Contributions to the development of waste
   management in Switzerland{''} show that decision transparency,
   interregional cooperation, information policy and public participation
   are important factors with regard to the public acceptance of waste
   management in Switzerland. 2. The much discussed problem area of public
   acceptance of waste policies is directly linked to the concept of Social
   Compatibility, which is identified as an essential component of
   sustainable and successful waste management. As an additional aspect,
   the significance of mediation as a participatory process for public
   acceptance will be investigated. Public dialogues on concrete waste
   management projects not accepted by parts of the population, will
   therefore be initiated, monitored and evaluated. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Potable and monitoring wells located in close proximity to a large
   groundwater recharge project which utilizes a blend of surface water and
   reclaimed wastewater for recharge were tested for coliphage over a
   period of 6 months to assess the potential for virus migration. During
   the first 3 months FRNA phage were detected once at a shallow monitoring
   well. In late summer, an unexpected pulse of phage was detected in all
   wells, including control sites, suggesting an ecological phenomenon
   independent of recharge operations. Cubic and filamentous F-specific
   coliphage, consistent with the Levivridae and Inoviridae groups, and a
   noncontractile tailed phage consistent with the Siphoviridae family were
   detected. There was no discernible relationship between recharge
   operations and the pattern of phage populations detected. Phage were
   detected using a host designated HS12, a variant of KS(pFamp)R
   (Debartolomeis, J. and Cabelli, V. J. (1991) Evaluation of an
   Escherichia roll host strain for enumeration of f male-specific
   bacteriophages. Appl. Environ. Microbiol, 57, 1301.). During the study
   it was found that HS12 contained a temperate Myoviridae phage;
   Myoviridae phage were subsequently excluded from the results. A total of
   26 production wells, including 3 control sites, were sampled monthly and
   6 monitoring wells were sampled every two weeks: Water reclamation plant
   effluents and river water upstream of effluent discharges were randomly
   sampled. The concentration and distribution of phage isolated was quite
   different in chlorinated effluent compared to river water. The majority
   of isolates from reclaimed water were filamentous DNA F-specific phage
   suggesting this group was more resistant to chlorine. Groundwater
   samples were analyzed using a novel large volume enrichment technique
   that proved very sensitive for detecting low concentrations of phage.

Abstract = {{During the winter months, the application of large quantities of glycol
   based anti- and de-icers to aircraft and runways poses a serious threat
   to receiving waters because of their toxicity and BOD effect. The
   orthodox approach has been to store runoff waters in aerated lagoons
   before discharge to receiving waters or to sewage treatment works. In
   the development of a pollution control strategy for Heathrow Airport
   Ltd. (HAL), a combination of alternative methods for treatment are being
   considered, and amongst these is the use of constructed wetlands on a
   pilot scale. Results from this study indicate that most constructed
   wetland plants and substrate micro-organism populations throughout the
   beds are nor adversely affected by airport runoff or exposure to
   shock-loads of glycols at initial total concentrations of 1l80mg/1 and
   632mg/1 in the subsurface and surface flow reedbeds respectively. Apart
   from Typha spp, the aquatic macrophytes have adapted well to the
   exposure to airport runoff. Glycol removal efficiencies have improved as
   the beds have matured, and average removal efficiencies of 78\% for the
   sub-surface system and 54\% for the surface system have been recorded.
   Complimentary monitoring of substrate micro-organism populations prior
   to and after glycol dosings have shown that aerobic microbial groups of
   bacteria, fungi and actinomyctes, are present in higher numbers
   (10(5)-10(7) CFU/g substrate dry weight) than their anaerobic
   counterparts (10(3)-10(5) CFU/g substrate dry weight). In the
   laboratory, studies have shown fungi and bacteria to be most tolerant of
   glycol, with several strains able to utilise these compounds. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A better understanding of the mechanisms and ecology of resin acid
   biodegradation will contribute to improved performance of existing
   treatment systems and development of new treatment systems for pulp and
   paper mill effluents. Using molecular genetic methods; we have partially
   elucidated the biochemical pathway for degradation of abietane resin
   acids by Pseudomonas abietaniphila BKME-9. We identified genes encoding
   putative membrane-associated proteins that are required for abietane
   metabolism. These proteins may function in cellular uptake of, or
   response to, resin acids. Genetic and physiological evidence suggests
   that a monooxygenase is involved in the biochemical pathway. A
   quantitative PCR assay was developed for ditA1, a gene from BKME-9
   encoding resin acid degradation. In an aerated lagoon treating pulp mill
   effluent, a population carrying ditA1 was found, which was a small
   fraction (10(-7)) of the total microbial community. This population was
   evenly distributed throughout the system and was a stable member of the
   community over time. Quantitative PCR assays were used to monitor
   Pseudomonas abietaniphila BKME-9 and Zoogloea resiniphila DhA-35 when
   they were separately used to inoculate a complex microbial communities
   in laboratory sequencing batch reactors. Both inocula were stably
   maintained in the community for 24 days. These inocula stimulated resin
   acid removal by the community when it was stressed by high pH or by high
   resin acid loading. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf

Note = {{International Conference and Workshop on Integrated Management of Water
   Quality at CSIM, TEOLO, ITALY, MAY 11-16, 1997}},
Abstract = {{Concern over agricultural diffuse pollution sources in integrated water
   quality management has been growing recently. Such sources are likely to
   be even more critical in developing countries, including India; where
   agriculture and rural habitats are still dominant, unlike the G7 or
   other affluent industrialised nations. A number of special features of
   the Indian scene need to be considered. These include: (i) extremely
   varying rainfall and stream-flow patterns; (ii) still largely
   traditional agricultural practices with average application of
   fertilizers and pesticides and significant areas under dry farming or
   only marginal irrigation; (iii) a very large cattle population, with
   agriculture almost always linked with animal husbandry; (iv) a culture
   of living close to the river (if not in the river) with dominating
   instream uses of bathing, washing, cattle wading, waste disposal, etc.
   and large-scale floodplain farming; and (v) scant respect for rules,
   regulations and laws alongside an extremely weak law-enforcement
   machinery.
   The paper shows that in the non-monsoon (non-flood) periods, which may
   account for all but 2 months of a year, agricultural diffuse pollution
   sources seem to have no impact on stream water quality. During these
   periods flows are low to minimal and pollution is dominated by the
   in-stream uses, sullage waters of rural communities and point discharges
   from urban/industrial sources, if any. Pollution due to agricultural
   return waters, either as wash-off or as seepage, appears to be rare
   during the 8-10 fair weather months. However, surface wash-off of
   pollutants from agricultural sources becomes the dominant factor during
   flood flows, and seepage/drainage from agricultural fields/soils
   continues to pollute streams far a month or two after the monsoons are
   over.
   Application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides (or any other
   agricultural chemicals) in India is still low compared to developed
   countries, and while eutrophication due to high levels of washed-off
   nutrients is observed in rural ponds and other stagnant bodies of water
   receiving agricultural drainage, and excessive pesticide residuals are
   often reported for vegetables, fodder, milk, etc., monitoring of streams
   and rivers does not show any significant pollution due to nutrients or
   pesticides from agricultural diffuse pollution during fair weather
   months. High nitrate concentrations have been reported in groundwater
   and in many areas, such as Punjab and Haryana, these can often be linked
   directly to diffuse agricultural sources. The major problem of
   agricultural diffuse pollution appears to be the heavy silt loads, along
   with large quantities of dissolved salts, nutrients, organics and even
   heavy metals and bacterial contaminants washed off during floods. The
   silt tends to clog up the flow channel to further encourage seasonal
   floodplain agriculture. This results in a vicious circle, which degrades
   the channel. increases flood-damage and is undesirable from ecological
   and sustainability points of view. High concentrations of salts and
   nutrients encourage growth of weeds and macrophytes after the floods
   have passed. The presence of organics, heavy metals and bacterial
   contamination renders the streamwater unfit for in-stream use or
   abstraction.
   With the introduction of intensive agriculture and adoption of modern
   farming techniques involving the application of much irrigation water
   and agricultural chemicals, the problems caused by diffuse agricultural
   pollution are bound to grow. Routine pollution control methods of
   discharge permits (or consent letters), EIAs or environmental audits,
   and normal enforcement measures by regulatory agencies are not likely to
   work for control of such pollution. Using the example of a small river
   in central India, Paisuni (Mandakini), the paper brings out the nature
   of the problems, and suggests a possible management approach. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The performance of a bench-scale horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized
   sludge (HAIS) reactor treating a synthetic substrate under increasing
   influent sulfate (SO42-) concentrations was investigated. The synthetic
   substrate was composed of glucose, methanol and ammonium acetate,
   besides bicarbonate and trace metal nutritional solution. The reactor
   was filled with polyurethane foam cubic matrices for biomass
   immobilization. Influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) was kept almost
   constant along the experiments (2162 +/- 250 mg.l(-1)) while influent
   sulfate concentration was increased from 9 to 501 mg.l(-1), resulting in
   COD/SO42- ratio of 249, 66, 19.7 and 4.3 in the four experimental phases
   tested. After a short start-up period, no significant variations in COD
   removal efficiency were observed for the COD to sulfate ratios
   evaluated. Although sulfate reduction was expected to interfere with the
   methanogenic process, detrimental effects on the overall reactor
   performance were not observed. Moreover, monitoring parameters indicated
   that the reactor achieved stable operational conditions immediately
   after short transient periods following the increase of influent sulfate
   concentrations. Microscopic analysis of the sludge within the reactor
   permitted to observe the presence of both methanogenic and sulfate
   reducing bacteria, indicating that syntrophism and not competition
   seemed to be the predominant relationship between these two groups under
   the COD to sulfate ratios assayed. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is very little known about the effectiveness of wastewater
   treatment systems for saline wastewater generated by seafood processing
   industries, aquaculture and tourism activities. In particular, the
   effect of salinity on nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater
   treatment processes is not well understood. Therefore we devised
   experiments to examine the treatment of highly saline wastewater, by
   using artificial seafood processing wastewater, for removal of nitrogen
   and phosphorus. Lab scale sequencing batch reactors (SBR) were initially
   operated at low, and then at increasing salt levels, to determine the
   overall effects of salinity on the nutrient removal performance. The
   microbial populations during these experiments were monitored to
   determine the specific effect of salinity on the various bacterial
   groups responsible for nutrient removal. The methods used were whole
   cell probing with fluorescently labelled RNA-directed oligonucleotide
   probes. Experimental data showed that the SBRs achieved good biological
   nutrient removal (BNR) when salinity levels in the influent were low
   (0.03\% to 0.2\% NaCl) but showed difficulties with biological
   phosphorus removal at salinity levels of 0.5\%. It was found that there
   was a dominance of Grampositive bacteria with a high mol\% G+C in their
   DNA in the SBR treating wastewater with NaCl at 0.03\% to 0.2\%. The
   addition of acetate to improve BNR performance increased the proportion
   of bacteria from the beta Proteobacterial subclass. (C) 1999 IAWQ

Abstract = {{An input-output mass balance watershed model was developed and tested on
   ten large benchmark watersheds in the northeastern United States. Inputs
   of chlorides, sulfates, potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen were
   calculated from published census data on population, wastewater
   discharges, land use, air emissions, agriculture, forestry, and
   transportation. Attenuation factors were selected for the inputs, (for
   example, air deposition, fertilizer, point source discharges) and the
   average annual riverine export flux for the watersheds was calculated
   for the period from 1900 to 1995. Historic chlorides, sulfates,
   potassium phosphorus and nitrogen river export fluxes were independently
   calculated for each watershed using long term monitoring data obtained
   primarily from the USGS and public water supplies. A comparison of the
   attenuated watershed inputs and the monitored output river flux suggests
   that it is possible to obtain reasonable estimates of watershed export
   fluxes from existing landscape input data. The above methodology was
   applied to two major tributaries of the Hudson River and the results are
   described. Input-output models which can simulate long term historical
   changes in riverine fluxes based on inputs rather than on land use types
   will be useful for the development of effective and efficient nutrient
   control programs on a watershed basis. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In an attempt to gain a better understanding of ammonia and nitrogen
   removal processes in multi-pond wastewater treatment lagoons, an
   analysis was carried out of data obtained during regular monitoring of
   Lagoon 115E at the Western Treatment Plant in Melbourne. To do this, a
   contour plot approach was developed that enables the data to be
   displayed as a function of pond number and date. Superimposition of
   contour plots for different parameters enabled the dependence of ammonia
   and nitrogen removal rates on various lagoon characteristics to be
   readily assessed. The importance of nitrification as an ammonia removal
   mechanism was confirmed. Temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and
   algal concentration all had a significant influence on whether or not
   sizeable nitrifier populations developed and persisted in lagoon waters.
   The analysis made it evident that a better understanding of microbial,
   chemical and physical processes in lagoons is needed before their
   nitrogen removal capabilities can be predicted with confidence. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{A pilot-scale, two-stage (carbon oxidation stage one, ammonia oxidation
   stage two) fixed film biological aerated filter (BAF) process was
   operated during the wintertime on-site at a domestic wastewater
   treatment plant. Over the study period hydraulic loadings to the system
   were varied and generated a range of organic and ammonia loading
   conditions. Nitrification performance was monitored based on water
   quality along the length of the filters, effluent water quality, and
   activity levels of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria within the biofilm using
   an oligonucleotide probe. Overall nitrification efficiency for
   wintertime conditions (average temperature 12.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C) was
   greater than 90 percent when ammonia-N loadings to the second stage were
   0.6 kg/m(3)-day or less. Nitrification efficiency started to deteriorate
   at loadings beyond this point Biofilm and liquid samples were collected
   along the distance of the two columns at high and low ammonia loadings.
   The degree of activity observed by ammonia oxidizing bacteria in the
   biofilm corresponded with the disappearance of ammonia and the
   generation of nitrate as water passed through the columns. The zones of
   ammonia oxidizing activity progressed along the length of the columns as
   organic and ammonia loadings to the system increased. The
   oligonucleotide probe data suggest that this shift in the location of
   the nitrifier population is due to higher BOD loads to the second stage,
   which supported higher levels of heterotrophic growth in the column. (C)

Abstract = {{Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a volatile oxygenate commonly used
   in fuels, is a frequent contaminant of some shallow groundwater. Based
   on limited reporting, concentrations of MTBE in drinking water were
   generally less than 10 mu g/L but excursions up to 770 mu g/L have been
   reported. Based on current MTBE toxicological data with emphasis on
   carcinogenic potential, and reproductive and developmental effects, a
   maximum drinking water level of 100 mu g MTBE/L is suggested. This
   recommended advisory level takes into consideration the equivocal
   evidence of the carcinogenicity of MTBE in humans and low potency in an
   oral exposure animal study. Definitive conclusions regarding health
   risks to the general population from MTBE contamination of drinking
   water are not possible due to a paucity of monitoring data. There is
   increased evidence of contamination of storm water and shallow
   groundwater from primarily, nonpoint sources. Considering MTBE mobility
   and stability in water, movement to deep groundwater and drinking water
   supplies seems probable. In light of projected increased MTBE use, there
   is a need for a more rigorous monitoring program to define the frequency
   of MTBE contamination of drinking water supplies and to develop risk
   management policies. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The great majority of adult Wilson's Phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor) is
   thought to stage at Great Salt Lake, Utah, Mono Lake, California, and/or
   Lake Abert, Oregon, before making a nonstop flight to South America.
   Their concentration at a few localities provides an exceptional
   opportunity for studying trends species-wide, so long as several
   important assumptions are fulfilled Observations from 1980 through 1997
   indicated that numbers of staging adults approximated 500,000-600,000 in
   the 1980s, then dropped by about half in the 1990s. Data from the
   breeding grounds in 1967-1992, including Breeding Bird Surveys, also
   indicated a general decline had been in progress, but did not indicate
   any sudden recent changes. The validity and severity of the decline is
   hard to test because correspondence between population sizes predicted
   from BBS trends and observations from staging areas is poor.
   Difficulties in gathering and interpreting data from a species that is
   easy to study raises questions about our ability to monitor and
   understand population trends in less amenable species. Whether
   population fluctuations in Wilson's Phalaropes are related to the
   availability of habitat in the main breeding range requires
   confirmation.}},

Journal = {{WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-53}},
Abstract = {{Because of concerns about apparent population declines and low
   productivity of Cull-billed Terns (Sterna nilotica) along the coast of
   Virginia, we investigated whether food limitations may result in
   retarded growth rates of young. Several colonies of Gull-billed Terns
   were monitored from May to July each year from 1994 to 1996 on both
   sandy barrier islands and marsh/shellpile islands in coastal Virginia.
   Nests were visited one to three times a week to monitor clutch size and
   hatching success, and enclosures were installed around selected nests to
   monitor chick growth from hatching to at least two weeks of age. When
   comparing chick growth, we found significant year, habitat and hatch
   order effects. Chicks from marsh shellpiles had higher mass and culmen
   growth rates than did those from barrier islands, and first-hatched
   chicks had significantly higher culmen growth rates than did
   second-hatched chicks. Year effects were only found for mass growth
   rates. Growth rates of Gull-billed Terms in these Virginia colonies seem
   to be low relative to those of six other North American tern species
   from other geographic areas. These findings suggest that growth rates of
   young Gull-billed Terns, as well as other reproductive parameters, need
   to be examined in detail in other coastal areas such as Texas, where the
   species is more abundant, to determine whether our growth results are
   species- or region-specific.}},

Abstract = {{Because of a long-term population decline in Gull-billed Terns (Sterna
   nilotica) nesting along the coast of Virginia, we began a three-year
   study in 1994 to monitor hatching success and survival of Gull-billed
   Tern chicks at several Virginia colony sites. Colonies were located on
   either small, storm-deposited shellpiles along marsh fringes or large,
   sand-shell overwash fans of barrier islands. Nests were monitored one to
   three times a week for hatching success, and enclosures were installed
   around selected nests to monitor chick survival from hatching to about
   two weeks Of age. Hatching success was lower in marsh colonies than
   island colonies, and was lower in 1995 than in 1994 and 1996, primarily
   because of flooding. The average brood size of nests where at least one
   chick hatched was 1.99 chicks. Survival rates of chicks to 14 days
   depended on hatch order and year but not brood size (one vs. two or
   more) or time of season. First-hatched chicks had higher survival rates
   than second-hatched and third-hatched chicks (0.661 compared to 0.442
   and 0.357, respectively). The year effect Has significant only for
   first-hatched chicks, dth lower survival in 19994 (0.50) than in 1995
   (0.765) or 1996 (0.758). Overall, productivity was low (0.53 chick per
   nest) compared to estimates for colonies in Denmark and was attributable
   to nest flooding by spring and storm-driven high tides and chick
   predation, mostly by Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus).}},

Abstract = {{The White-faced Storm-petrel (Pelagodroma marina) breeds on several
   tropical, sub-tropical and temperate islands in both hemispheres, but
   some aspects of its breeding biology are still poorly known. The
   European subspecies hypoleuca is almost confined to a small archipelago,
   the Salvage Islands,:about 300 km south of Madeira Island, North-east
   Atlantic. Because of its very localized distribution, this subspecies is
   relatively vulnerable to extinction and its population dynamics need to
   be understood and monitored. We studied the breeding biology of the
   White-faced Storm-petrel at Selvagem Grande Island in 1996. Birds first
   arrived at the colony in mid-December, eggs were laid from mid-March to
   early June, and the last chicks fledged in mid-August. Mean incubation
   period was 53.7 days, but was highly variable due to frequent
   egg-neglect that affected at least two thirds of the clutches. Mean
   nestling period was 60.3 days. Chick growth (body mass and wing length)
   is described. Hatching success was 60.7\% (N = 89) and fledging success
   was 88.9\% (N = 54). Breeding success (53.9\%) was not low, in spite of
   frequent predation by house mice (Mus musculus), the main cause of
   nesting failures. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cunniculus) and Yellow-legged
   Gulls (Larus cachinnans), two species thought to pose threats to other
   seabirds of the region, had no measurable negative effect on breeding
   performance at our study nests. However, we had some evidence that gulls
   prey upon chicks and adult birds. Breeding success did not correlate
   with egg size. There was a highly significant seasonal decline in both
   hatching and fledging success. Using data on burrow density and
   occupancy obtained in the main colony, we estimated the breeding
   population on Selvagem Grande at around 36,000 pairs.}},

   Breeding of Fea's Petrel was not confirmed and new sites of Bulwer's
   Petrel were not found (previous status: one site, 50 pairs), but
   previously undocumented colonies were identified for the remaining
   species. Manx Shearwater occurred in four colonies with 115-235 pairs
   (previous status: probable breeder),Little Shearwater occurred in 28
   colonies with 840-1,530 pairs (previously: four locations, >150 pairs),
   hot-season Band-rumped Storm-petrels occurred in 5 colonies with 250-300
   pairs (previously: two locations, 200 pairs) and cool-season Band-rumped
   Storm-petrels were found in eight locations with 665-740 pairs
   (previously: three locations, 600 pairs). Most colonies were confined to
   precipitous cliffs and islets, which may be a result of predation
   threats by introduced mammals. Although these surveys provided a
   valuable revision of the status and distribution for these species of
   conservation concern, further survey work is warranted and target areas
   are indicated. We discuss the potential and limitations of listening for
   nocturnal vocalizations as a method to sun ev and monitor shearwater and
   petrel populations in inaccessible habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Adelie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are sensitive indicators of change
   in Antarctic marine and terrestrial habitats, and have been intensively
   monitored as part of international efforts to understand the role of
   apex predators in the Southern Oceans. Among the key variables annually
   assessed by these monitoring programs are measures of population change
   which are typically obtained with ground and aerial censuses. Aerial
   censuses, how ever, are expensive and logistically complex, while the
   accuracy of ground censuses tends to decrease as colony size increases,
   especially in complex landscapes where high relief may block sections of
   the colony from the observer's view. Here we describe the use of kites
   equipped with remote-controlled cameras to census Adelie Penguin
   colonies at Palmer Station, a research site in the western Antarctic
   Peninsula region. We suggest that this method, which produced excellent
   results, may bridge an important gap between ground and aerial censuses,
   offering the opportunity to obtain better data for large or difficult to
   census colonies at a fraction of the cost of aerial surveys.}},

Pages = {{35-52}},
Abstract = {{The abundance of the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, was
   estimated using a model that incorporated estimated pup production. Pups
   are born at only five sites, four of which are at the sub-Antarctic
   Auckland Islands, which lie to the south of New Zealand. The remaining
   breeding site is at Campbell Island in the same region. Pup production
   was estimated during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons from
   mark-recapture studies at the two largest sea lion rookeries, at the
   Auckland Islands (Sandy Bay and Dundas Island), which account for almost
   90\% of total pup production for the species. Pup production for the
   other sites was estimated from direct counts or, in the case of Campbell
   Island, from recent tagging data. Total pup production estimates for all
   sites during the 1994/95 and 1995/96 breeding seasons are 2640 and 2807
   respectively. During the four-week pupping season, pup mortality at most
   sites was estimated to be about 10\%. The estimates of absolute
   abundance based on pup production for the two breeding seasons were
   11700 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 10500-13100) and 12500 (95\% CI:
   11100-14000) respectively. This population abundance is among the
   smallest reported for a species within the Otariidae. The highly
   localised, and historically reduced distribution make this species
   vulnerable to impact and warrants particular attention from conservation
   managers. In particular, the potential impact of the annual bycatch of
   P. hookeri in a trawl fishery requires close monitoring and, ideally,
   some mitigation action.}},

Pages = {{81-99}},
Abstract = {{There are few published studies of the population ecology of the larvae
   of Australian native anurans. In this study we report on the population
   dynamics of the larvae of the Australian frog Crinia signifera at a
   study site near Bridgewater in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia. The
   predator community was also monitored to provide an indication of the
   importance of predation in influencing the population dynamics of C.
   signifera larvae. Pool drying meant larvae failed to metamorphose from
   temporary pools in all years of the study. In a permanent pond,
   mortality was high and variable, with an average of 10\% survival over
   the three years of the study. There was a complete failure to recruit to
   the terrestrial phase in one year. Predation pressure was thought to be
   the most important source of mortality in the permanent pond, although
   predator numbers Varied considerably between and within years. When
   combined with information on the population ecology of the embryonic
   (Williamson and Bull 1994) and terrestrial (Williamson and Bull 1996)
   stages, the data suggest that the aquatic phase is the key phase in the
   population dynamics of this species.}},

Abstract = {{The former distributions of stick-nest rats (Leporillus conditor and L.
   apicalis), both extinct on the Australian mainland since about the
   1930s, were determined from literature reports, museum records,
   interview responses and field surveys of key areas. Population
   parameters were determined for L. conditor from early literature
   accounts, studies of remnant stick-nests in caves, a three-year study of
   the last known naturally-occurring populations on the Franklin Islands,
   records maintained for a captive-breeding program since 1986, and
   further population data obtained during systematic monitoring of
   reintroduced populations. Comparable data for L. apicalis could be
   obtained only from early literature accounts and remnant stick-nests in
   caves; this species has not been recorded since 1933 and is presumed
   extinct.
   Leporillus conditor is a predominantly ground-dwelling, herbivorous
   rodent of semi-arid, perennial shrubland habitats, which builds nests of
   interwoven sticks for protection from the elements and from predators.
   Leporillus apicalis apparently occupied similar habitats, often in
   sympatry with L. conditor, but extended its range further into the arid
   zone and may have had a more arboreal life-style and a more diverse
   diet, including invertebrates. The demise of both species from the
   mainland was almost certainly due to severe habitat degradation caused
   by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before, and leading
   into, severe drought conditions. The resulting reduction in availability
   of food and cover also led to an increased vulnerability to predation
   (primarily by foxes, cats, dingoes and owls).
   In current L. conditor populations, females reproduce throughout the
   year and have well-defined home-ranges with relatively small core
   activity areas. Males have considerably larger home ranges. Predation by
   owls, especially barn owls (Tyto alba) is a significant cause of
   Leporillus mortalities, highlighting the importance of cover for the
   rats' survival.}},

Abstract = {{Malaria is still one of the greatest causes of mortality in the world;
   in Brazil there are over 500.000 reported cases each year. Malaria,
   caused by the protozoon Plasmodium, has been aggravated by the
   increasing resistance of Plasmodium to the traditional drugs chloroquine
   and mefloquine. The study of new drugs resulted in the identification of
   anti-malarial activities of an endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone,
   called Qinghaosu or Artemisinin, extracted from the leaves of Artemisia
   annua L., from the Asteraceae family. The research work developed at
   MEDIPLANT (Switzerland) and CPQBA-UNICAMP (Brazil) involved the
   selection and breeding of genotypes rich in artemisinin and presenting
   high biomass followed by a second selection to adaptation to Brazilian
   climatic conditions. Through controlled hybridization between selected
   genotypes from China and Vietnam, genetic gain was obtained as
   artemisinin and population uniformity. Through the increase of biomass
   and artemisinin content (estimated by analytical monitoring), it was
   possible to increase the artemisinin production of 5 Kg/ha for the base
   population to approximately 25 Kg/ha for the genetically bred
   population. Ln the cultivation carried out in Brazil, 3 hybrid lines,
   2/39 x 1V, 1V x 2/39 and Ch x Viet.55 produced respectively 21.38, 19.27
   and 15.80 Kg of artemisinin/ha. The cultivation of these new hybrid
   lines in Brasil is technically viable and highly competitive, due to the
   production obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The INTEX-project is an interdisciplinary approach to combine
   agricultural research and farming system development. In focus are two
   of the current farming systems: a) conventional farming, according to
   ``Good Farming Practice{''} (three course rotation, inversion tillage);
   b) Integrated Farming System (four course rotation, flexible inversion
   or non-inversion tillage). Field size and crop management are according
   to practical demands. All crops of the rotation are established in every
   year. Starting in 1990, presently at least two cycles of the rotations
   are completed.
   During 9 years experimental time, populations of Galium aparine were
   monitored. Populations showed similar behaviour in Good Farming Practice
   and in Integrated Farming. Despite of higher densities during the first
   rotation in integrated Farming, abundance of cleavers decreased again
   with course of rime. The occurrence of the perennial weed Cirsium
   arvense was mapped in three successive years on two single fields of
   each farming system. Number of Cirsium-patches increased in winter
   barley and were suppressed again in the following oilseed rape. Again
   there was only a slight difference between the two farming systems.
   Using a geometrical ``available area{''}-approach, the population
   changes could be rested statistically.
   This on-farm study showed that integrated weed management in farming
   systems can be maintained in the long term. Weed problems must not be
   worse than in conventional farming. Problems and perspectives of
   studying weeds in a field scale versus plot: experiments are discussed.}},

Title = {{Molecular and immunogenetic analysis of major histocompatibility
   haplotypes in northern bobwhite enable direct identification of

Abstract = {{The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a group of genetic loci
   coding for haplotypes that have been associated with fitness traits in
   mammals and birds. Such associations suggest that MHC diversity may be
   an indicator of overall genetic fitness of endangered or threatened
   species. The MHC haplotypes of a captive population of 12 families of
   northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) were identified using a
   combination of immunogenetic and molecular techniques. Alloantisera were
   produced within families of northern bobwhites and were then tested for
   differential agglutination of erythrocytes of all members of each
   family. The pattern of reactions determined from testing these
   alloantisera identified a single genetic system of alloantigens in the
   northern bobwhites, resulting in the assignment of a tentative genotype
   to each individual within the quail families. Restriction fragment
   patterns of the DNA of each bird were determined using the chicken MHC
   B-G cDNA probe bg11. The concordance between the restriction fragment
   patterns and the alloantisera reactions showed that the alloantisera had
   identified the MHC of the northern bobwhite and supported the tentative
   genotype assignments, identifying at least 12 northern bobwhite MHC
   haplotypes. Eighteen northern bobwhite alloantisera were then used to
   detect a minimum of 17 masked bobwhite MHC haplotypes. Subsequent
   restriction fragment pattern analyses using cDNA probes for chicken MHC
   genes were in agreement with agglutination patterns displayed by the
   antisera, showing that the immunogenetically identified alloantigen
   system constituted the MHC of the masked bobwhite. These data
   demonstrate that a non-endangered species may be used to provide
   antisera for differentiating MHC haplotypes in a closely related
   endangered species, thus providing a practical basis for long-range
   monitoring of MHC haplotypes of birds surviving in their native
   habitats. Zoo Biol 18:279-294, 1999. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and the ribbed mussel,
   Geukensia demissa, were compared on intertidal shores of a New Jersey
   salt marsh where their distributions overlap. Individuals were tethered
   to stakes in Spartina patches, in open spaces without Spartina, or in
   pools and were monitored between June and September 1995. More M. edulis
   died than G. demissa in all habitats. M. edulis survived best in
   Spartina patches while G. demissa survived best in pools. Failure-time
   analysis was used to estimate median survival times for each species in
   each habitat. A typical blue mussel will die within the first 40 days,
   whereas a typical ribbed mussel is likely to survive for several years.
   Causes of death were not determined in this study, but their pattern was
   consistent with heat stress. Species-specific differences in mortality
   may have important consequences for the distributions and persistence of
   these mussels. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, scientists are being called upon to assist in the
   development of indicators for monitoring ecosystem health. For human
   health indicators, they may draw on environmental exposure, human
   morbidity/mortality or well-being and sustainability approaches. To
   improve the rigour of indicators, we propose six scientific criteria for
   indicator selection: (1) data availability, suitability and
   representativeness (of populations), (2) indicator validity (face,
   construct, predictive and convergent) and reliability; (3) indicator
   responsiveness to change; (4) indicator desegregation capability (across
   personal and community characteristics); (5) indicator comparability
   (across populations and jurisdictions); and (6) indicator
   representativeness (across important dimensions of concern). We comment
   on our current capacity to adhere to such criteria with examples of
   measures of environmental exposure, human health and sustainability. We
   recognize the considerable work still required on documenting
   environment-human health relationships and on monitoring potential
   indicators in similar ways over time. Yet we argue that such work is
   essential in order for science to inform policy decisions which affect
   the health of ecosystems and human health. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The farming system of the Kano close-settled zone, northern Nigeria, is
   known for its longevity and continued productivity in spite of
   population increases in the area. Mounting circumstantial evidence has
   led to its reputation of being `sustainable'. Rural population density
   in this region now exceeds 300 km(-2), and almost all land (86.4\%) is
   under annual cultivation. It is generally believed that such an
   intensive fanning system is only possible under high input levels. This
   study set out to determine the nutrient balance to see if the system
   really was sustainable. Agronomic and soil fertility management
   practices were monitored on three farms over a two year period. Inputs
   and outputs measured at the field level included fertilizer use (manure
   and inorganic), dry deposition, biological N fixation, and the harvest
   of crops and hedgerow products. The results indicate great variability
   among fields, farmers, and years, and showed that the N balance was
   strongly negative, whereas P, K, and Mg balances were close to zero. The
   Ca balance was quite positive as a result of dry deposition. The study
   also quantified nutrient dynamics within the farming system,
   highlighting, (1) the role of leguminous crops in bringing in N through
   fixation, and as a source of fodder for small ruminants, (2) the role of
   small ruminants in converting cop residues into manure, and (3) the
   input of nutrients through dry deposition. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science
