Abstract = {{By means of monthly in situ incubations, variations in oxygen uptake,
   nutrient release and C/N-ratio were monitored during a period of 14
   months of a mussel population (Mytilus edulis L.) located on an exposed
   beach. A condition index calculated as weight/length(3) showed that the
   condition of the mussels was highest in the spring. Specific oxygen
   uptake and nutrient release had separate maxima, with high oxygen uptake
   in the spring coinciding with a period of growth, and high nutrient
   release during summer when the temperature was highest. Oxygen uptake
   was significantly correlated with both the condition of the mussels and
   the temperature, while ammonium release was significantly correlated
   only with the temperature. Except in spring, the oxygen uptake,
   condition index and O/N-ratio were low, indicating a poor condition of
   the mussels. The mussels suffered from suboptimal conditions caused by
   inadequate food supply and failed to accumulate glycogen reserves
   essential for the development of mature gametes.}},

Abstract = {{Population dynamics of Black-browed and Grey-headed Albatrosses Diomedea
   melanophris and D. chrysostoma were studied at Bird Island, South
   Georgia, for 17 consecutive years (1975-1991). Over this period, almost
   all the Grey-headed Albatross colonies decreased at an average rate of
   1.8\% per annum. Although the total Black-browed Albatross population
   increased (at 0.8\% p.a.), 14 of the 23 colonies (including both study
   colonies) decreased. Black-browed Albatrosses follow an annual breeding
   cycle: over 80\% of birds successful in rearing a chick and 75\% of
   those failing to do so returned to breed the next year, 5-10\% of both
   categories delayed one further year (even when still paired).
   Grey-headed Albatrosses are essentially biennial: <1\% of successful
   birds bred the next year, 68\% returned to breed 2 years later, 11\% the
   next and 5\% not until the fourth year. In contrast, over 50\% of birds
   that failed to rear a chick bred the next year, 23\% delayed for one
   further year. Birds which failed after March did not return the next
   year, whereas 80\% of birds which failed during incubation did breed the
   following year. Grey-headed Albatrosses showed higher (39\%) and more
   consistent breeding success than Black-browed Albatrosses (29\%,
   including 4 years of almost complete breeding failure); hatching success
   was similar in both species, and fledging success was the main source of
   variation in Black-browed Albatross productivity. We link this to the
   dependence of this species on Antarctic krill, a variable resource
   largely absent in 3 of the 4 years of widespread failure. Modal age of
   first breeding was 10 years for Black-browed and 12 years for
   Grey-headed Albatrosses. Overall, survival rate of juvenile Black-browed
   Albatrosses to recruitment as breeding birds averaged 28\% and 14\% for
   1960s and 1970s cohorts, respectively; for Grey-headed Albatrosses
   comparable values were 38\% and 6\%. Studies of immigration and
   emigration between colonies showed that no breeding birds moved, that
   philopatry of fledglings was generally high but that recruitment rates
   need to be increased by 1-3\% to allow for juveniles returning to
   non-natal colonies. Annual survival of adults averaged 93\% (s.e. +/-
   0.6) and 95\% (s.e. +/- 0.8) for Black-browed and Grey-headed
   Albatrosses, respectively; for sexed birds, rates were similar for
   Grey-headed Albatrosses but 2\% higher for female Black-browed
   Albatrosses. With our data, lifetime productivity was 30\% higher for
   Black-browed Albatrosses, but this could be offset by a change in adult
   survival rate of less than 1\%. The proximate reason for the population
   decline in the studied colonies was high juvenile mortality, which has
   increased since the 1960s. It is likely that this reflects incidental
   mortality associated with fisheries (particularly entanglement in
   long-lines for tuna and collision with net-monitor cables of trawlers),
   but data are few and mainly circumstantial. Many differences between
   Grey-headed and Black-browed Albatrosses (e.g. the former showing later
   sexual maturity, less frequent breeding, higher and more consistent
   survival) probably relate to basic differences between annual and
   biennial breeding. Some differences (e.g. breeding success) probably
   relate to differences in diet; others (e.g. in juvenile survival) may
   reflect different at-sea distributions. Comparisons with other species
   revealed species and possibly site-specific differences rather than
   consistent patterns for annual and biennial breeders.}},

Abstract = {{An initial colony of 150 Neohydronomus affinis (Hustache) was imported
   from Australia in September, 1987. Between 1988 and 1991, about 8,000 N.
   affinis were released in five localities in northern Zimbabwe.
   Monitoring of water impoundments revealed that N. affinis caused severe
   damage and death of water lettuce plants through feeding scars caused by
   adults on growing shoots and mines by larvae on leaves. In less than ten
   months of initial releases, the populations of N. affinis reached 18
   insects per plant and the reduction in water lettuce permitted water
   hyacinth and other macrophytes to fill the vacant niche, particularly on
   the Manyame River system. However, in four other localities, where only
   water lettuce was a problem, more than 85\% of the water area became
   free from water lettuce. N. affinis populations decreased from 18 to 2
   per plant and at the same time water lettuce populations and plant size
   were reduced.}},

Abstract = {{(E)-11,13-Tetradecadienal (E11,13-14:Ald) is the major sex pheromone
   component of the eastern blackheaded budworm (EBB), Acleris variana
   (Fern.). The compound was identified in female pheromone gland extracts
   by coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD),
   coupled GC-mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode, and
   retention index calculations of candidate pheromone components.
   E11,13-14:Ald alone as trap bait was very attractive to male EBB.
   Addition of the corresponding diene alcohol or acetate or both did not
   enhance attraction. (Z)-11.13-Tetradecadienal in binary combination with
   (E)-11,13-14:Ald neither enhanced nor reduced trap catches. Increasing
   the amounts of pheromone from 0.01 to 10 pg increased trap catches, but
   increase of pheromone quantity above 100 mu g proportionately reduced
   attraction. Stabilization of slowly polymerizing E11,13-14:Ald and
   development of a sustained, adequate release rate is required for
   pheromone-based monitoring of EBB populations.}},

Abstract = {{Attraction and pheromonal activity of five major identified components
   of the male-produced sex pheromone of the Mediterranean fruit fly
   Ceratitis capitata to virgin laboratory-reared females was assessed in a
   laboratory flight tunnel. Dual-choice competitive assays were run to
   establish a baseline response of virgin females to live male pheromone,
   individual components, and an ensemble of all five compounds alone (air
   control) and competitively against one another. Approximately 50\% of
   the females released in the tunnel were captured on leaf models emitting
   pheromonal odors from five live males. Over 37\% of released females
   responded to an ensemble of five major identified components presented
   in individual capillaries. Response of females to individual components
   was less than 10\%. Competitive assays showed the live male-produced
   pheromone to be more attractive than either the five major component
   ensemble (FMCE) or individual components. Further research is likely to
   identify other male-produced compounds with pheromonal activity that
   could improve development of a pheromone-based trap for monitoring

   decreases away from the Central City toward the suburban fringe. It is
   important to note, however, that soil samples containing hazardous
   levels of lead were found in all neighborhoods of the county. These data
   suggest that although lead is concentrated in the central portions of
   cities, lead education, abatement, and monitoring may be necessary in
   all portions of cities. This suggested approach is in conflict with
   current strategies of lead monitoring that target one geographic area or
   that select a population for monitoring based upon socioeconomic status.}},

Abstract = {{Human serum transferrin (HSTF), human serum albumin (HSA) and rat serum
   were compared for their interaction with AlCl3, in a Tris-HCl buffer
   solutions (pH 7.4). The AlCl3 was tested in series of concentrations in
   the range of 50 mu M up to 500 mu M. HSTF, HSA and their 1:1 mixture and
   rat serum were incubated at 37 degrees C with series of AlCl3
   concentrations. The protein profile of the incubated solutions were
   compared to control using SDS-PAGE and FPLC tests. The results indicated
   that HSTF was more specifically responsive to AlCl3 showing a
   characteristic increase in its UV absorption, peak and area dimensions.
   Simultaneously, HSA was less affected, but it showed a significant shift
   with an increase in molecular weight accompanied with a change in its
   profile. The respective bands of transferrin and albumin in rat serum
   behaved similarly. The SDS-PAGE and FPLC data coincided and confirmed
   the preferential affinity of HSTF to bind with Al3+. These results
   support the suggestion of using HSTF for monitoring levels of Al3+ in
   human blood samples of exposed population. The importance of further
   developing such a biomarker is the increased demand for early detection
   of the hazardous levels of Al3+ in relation to its long term neurotoxic
   adverse effects.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate measurements of radiation exposure for individuals are critical
   to assessing radiation-mortality associations. This paper is based on a
   study of changes in recorded doses and in radiation monitoring programs
   at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy facility
   where whole body external penetrating radiation exposures have been of
   primary epidemiological interest. External radiation monitoring data
   from 1943-1984 are analyzed for a group of white males (N = 8,318). The
   proportion of workers monitored for external radiation increased from
   about 50\% in 1943 to over 80\% in 1944 to above 98\% after 1948. Mean
   radiation doses showed maxima in 1944 and 1957, followed by steady and
   long-term declines. Numerous changes in monitoring programs occurred
   during the study period, including changes in the types of dosimeters
   used, the frequency of reading dosimeters, methods of calculating doses,
   and practices of recording doses. Temporal patterns of doses in the
   lower range of the distribution showed some changes suggestive of
   changes in policies and practices for recording doses, which would
   influence dose values used in epidemiological studies. Reliable and
   accurate exposure measurements are especially important in studies of
   low level exposures due to small differences in outcomes between
   exposure groups. Evidence of changes in recorded doses due to monitoring
   and recording practices, rather than to actual changes in exposures in
   this well-monitored population, suggests the importance of comparable
   studies of other populations used for epidemiological studies of
   radiation-mortality associations.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal and annual changes in the  abundance of Amblyomma americanum
   (L.) larvae, nympbs, and adults were monitored over a 5-yr period in the
   Piedmont physiographic region of Georgia. Tick abundance was monitored
   with cloth drags (all life stages) and CO2-baited cloth panels (nymphs
   and adults) monthly during March through September from 1987 through
   1991. Larvae appeared in substantial numbers in July and were most
   numerous in August and September. Small numbers of unfed larvae
   apparently overwintered each year based on their presence during March,
   April, or May. Nymphs were most numerous from April through June and
   declined to much lower numbers by August and September. Adults were most
   numerous from March through May and virtually disappeared by August.
   These seasonal patterns were similar to those reported for A. americanum
   at other southeastern locations. Each life stage exhibited similar
   trends of annual abundance with an increase in 1988 followed by a
   relatively steady decline to levels equivalent to or below initial 1987
   values by 1991. Major environmental variables that potentially could
   have influenced annual abundance were identified from Haile \& Mount's
   (1987) computerized model of A. americanum population dynamics. Habitat
   type, host density, and day length were constants and rationally could
   be excluded as causes of annual variations in abundance; weather and
   host-finding rate were presumed to have been primarily responsible for
   these annual differences.}},

Abstract = {{A large scale study of human exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was
   conducted in the Los Angeles Basin, the only metropolitan area in the
   United States that exceeds the NO2 NAAQS. Data are available for a
   population representative sample of 482 households and 682 individuals.
   Personal exposures, as well as indoor and outdoor home levels, were
   monitored using passive time-integ rating filter badges. Monitoring
   extended over a one-year period (May 1987 to May 1988), with each
   individual providing two consecutive days of data. Information was also
   collected on activity patterns, household and personal characteristics,
   and spatial and temporal variables. This paper describes the study
   design, summarizes the sample characteristics and representativeness,
   and presents the distribution of personal, indoor, and outdoor NO2
   concentrations recorded by the monitors. Over the entire sample, median
   personal and outdoor levels were 35 ppb; median indoor levels were 24
   ppb. Personal exposures for those in homes with gas ranges with pilot
   lights average 10 ppb greater than those with electric ranges, and 4 ppb
   greater than those with gas ranges without pilot lights. Forty percent
   of the variation in indoor concentrations is explained by outdoor
   levels; 59 percent of the variation in personal exposures is explained
   by indoor levels; and 48 percent of the variation in personal exposures
   is explained by outdoor levels.}},

Abstract = {{Scent-station surveys have been widely used to monitor bobcat (Felis
   rufus) populations, but relationships between bobcat abundance and the
   index derived from scent-station surveys have not been validated. In
   autumn 1988 and 1989 we reintroduced bobcats (n = 31) to Cumberland
   Island, Georgia. We conducted 15 scent-station surveys during
   September-February 1988, 1989, and 1990 to obtain scent-station indices
   (SSI) as we increased bobcat density. We found a positive relationship
   (r2 = 0.45, P = 0.0066) between population size and SSI. However,
   because SSI variance also was correlated positively with SSI, we
   transformed data to meet the assumption of homoscedasticity for the
   regression model (r2 = 0.73, P < 0.001). Predictions of population size
   using individual scent-station surveys bad poor precision. Analysis of
   statistical power indicated that 4 replicate scent-station surveys had
   an 80\% probability of detecting only large (greater-than-or-equal-to
   25\%) changes in populations of high density (0.5 bobcats/km2). We
   recommend that (1) multiple scent-station surveys be conducted each year
   to monitor changes in bobcat populations; (2) SSI values should be
   calculated as proportions and transformed to reduce heteroscedasticity;
   (3) each stratum in a sampling design should contain as many stations as
   possible to minimize the problem of discrete data (no. of visits)
   analyzed as a continuous variable (proportion of stations visited); (4)
   scent stations should be placed as far apart as logistically feasible to
   minimize multiple visits by individual bobcats; and (5) results of the
   power analysis should be used as a minimum guideline for estimating
   sample-size requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Wood duck (Aix sponsa) preseason banding data are essential to monitor
   the population and to evaluate management programs. Historically,
   numbers of banded wood ducks have not reached established banding goals,
   particularly for the adult female cohort. The lack of data has led to
   difficulties in accurately determining annual survival and recovery
   rates. We hypothesized that these estimates may be improved by
   incorporating additional banding records from a period (15 Apr-30 Jun)
   prior to the traditional preseason banding period (1 Jul-15 Sep). We
   examined recovery distributions to determine if early and late-banded
   wood ducks were representative of the same populations. We next
   developed models that allowed for combining early (15 Apr-30 Jun) and
   late (1 Jul-15 Sep) preseason banding data for adult wood ducks to
   estimate summer survival rates, and annual survival and recovery rates.
   Early and late-banded female wood duck recovery distributions were
   different (P < 0.05); however, differences were less than the
   differences between sex and age classes (P < 0.01) banded during the
   same period. There was no difference (P > 0.19) in recovery
   distributions for early and late-banded male wood ducks. We concluded
   that, data from wood ducks banded early and late were representative of
   the same populations. Adult summer survival rates varied among
   geographic regions (P < 0.02). The mean summer survival rate for adult
   female southern wood ducks was estimated as 58.00\% (SE = 5.96\%), while
   for female wood ducks in northern areas it averaged 85.46\% (SE =
   4.49\%). Annual survival and recovery rate estimates realized gains in
   precision when early and late-banding data were combined.}},

Abstract = {{Although banding programs are the most important source of information
   for monitoring the status of wood duck (Aix sponsa) populations, banding
   quotas generally have not been achieved during the preseason period.
   LeMaster and Trost (1994) developed a model that accommodated banding
   during an early period (15 Apr-30 Jun) in addition to the traditional
   preseason period (1 Jul-15 Sep). Their analysis of existing band
   recovery data showed that precision of survival and recovery rates for
   wood duck populations was increased by inclusion of early banded birds.
   My objective was to develop statistical methodology for computing
   optimum allocation of effort in the 2 banding periods and to apply this
   methodology to banding programs for wood ducks. Required early period
   sample sizes were large, and the relative cost had to be small before
   banding in the early period became cost effective. However, summer
   survival rates and movement patterns only can be estimated using early
   season banding; hence, additional effort may still be warranted if these
   parameters are of importance. This methodology also can be used as a
   planning tool for the design of any study in which 2 banding periods per
   year are used.}},

Abstract = {{Field data were obtained that document the extent to which the
   facultatively filter-feeding polychaete Nereis diversicolor undertakes
   suspension feeding at different times of the year in 2 Danish shallow
   water areas, eutrophicated (Odense Fjord) and unpolluted (Fyns Hoved). A
   modified phototransducer system was used to make continuous long-term
   recordings of the characteristic undulating body movements (pumping
   activity) indicative of filter feeding. Filter feeding was `triggered'
   by the presence of phytoplankton in the water, and the worm was filter
   feeding 50 to 100 \% of the time monitored during the productive summer
   period. In early spring and autumn filter feeding occurred for about 5
   to 20 \% of total time. At Fyns Hoved in September, when light was
   beginning to be a limiting factor for primary production, the chlorophyl
   a (chi a) concentration fluctuated around the `trigger level' of 1 to 3
   mu g chi a l(-1), and filter feeding only took place during the
   afternoon when primary production had elevated the phytoplankton biomass
   above the trigger level. The grazing impact of N. diversicolor
   (potentially 5.6 m(3) m(-2) d(-1) in May, representing a volume 11 to 55
   times greater than the overlying water column in Odense Fjord) was
   probably restricted on days with low wind-caused mixing of the water
   column by a thin layer of refiltered water overlying the sediment.
   Increased pumping activity with rising temperature led to a doubling of
   the population filtration potential from March to June in Odense Fjord
   even though the population biomass was concomitantly reduced by 30 \%.
   No temperature adaptation of pumping activity was found in N.
   diversicolor. This study confirms that N. diversicolor utilizes a number
   of feeding methods, depending on season, phytoplankton biomass and local
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The inheritance of Mutator activity in maize was characterized by
   monitoring the meiotic transmission of mutability at bz1-Mum4. In a
   series of bz1-Mum4 near-isolines, transmittance of Mutator-derived
   mutability was found to occur at a variety of pseudo-Mendelian
   frequencies that were determined by a `'conditioned'' state of each
   starting bz1-Mum4 line. Trends in subsequent transmission frequencies
   could be predicted by knowledge of the past transmission frequencies of
   that particular Mutator line. Inactivations of Mutator-derived
   mutabilities at different genes in the same plant were concurrent in all
   cases investigated. Transmission of bz1-Mum4 mutability was about
   equally efficient through tiller and main-stalk pollen, Mutator-loss
   lines exhibited a continuum of levels of dominance/recessiveness in
   crosses with active Mutator lines. At opposite ends of this spectrum
   were lines that could and lines that could not be reactivated to
   bz1-Mum4 mutability by crossing with an active Mutator stock. Similarly,
   active Mutator lines showed a range of degrees to which they could
   reactivate a Mutator-loss line. These data demonstrate that both
   positive and negative regulation of Mutator-derived mutability can be
   quantitatively inherited as a conditioned outcome of the founding
   Mutator element population. A simple model to explain these results
   posits that the `'condition'' of a founding Mutator line is a product of
   the ratio of total Mu elements (which provide or elicit negative
   regulation) to autonomous Mu elements (MuDR, which is both necessary for
   Mutator activity and may act to prevent and/or reverse Mutator
   inactivation).}},

Abstract = {{Challis milkvetch (Astragalus amblytropis Barneby) is endemic to the
   dry, rain-shadow region created by the mountains of west-central Idaho.
   The objectives of the study were to determine significant autecological
   characteristics, identify significant threats, and provide management
   recommendations for this species. This perennial plant is restricted to
   deep (> 1 m), relatively porous soils on south- and west-facing slopes
   throughout the area mapped as the Challis volcanics. In a two-year
   study, populations of Challis milkvetch decreased and showed low percent
   survival of seedlings and of non-reproductive and reproductive
   individuals. There were sufficient pollinators, and the plants set and
   dispersed viable seed. However, in the dry and unpredictable climate of
   east-central Idaho, establishment of Challis milkvetch seedlings is
   dependent on rapid growth of the taproot. Establishment of new Challis
   milkvetch plants and population size both changed dramatically over two
   consecutive years of below average precipitation.
   Anthropogenic disturbances, such as domestic livestock grazing, off-road
   vehicle use, mining, and herbicide spraying appear to be only minor
   threats to Challis milkvetch. Agencies should continue to monitor the
   species to determine population trends. Challis milkvetch habitat should
   be protected because it holds the seed bank for this and many other
   endemic species.}},

Abstract = {{During 1984 an unsanctioned farm road was constructed through the known
   range of McGregor's skink (Cyclodina macgregori) on Mana Island (217
   ha). Monitoring of the island's lizard populations commenced in 1986 to
   assess the effects of habitat changes caused by the construction of the
   road. Between 1987/88 and 1988/89 the capture rate (pitfall traps) for
   McGregor's skink declined significantly. This decline is attributed to
   increased predation by mice (Mus musculus) following a buildup of mouse
   numbers after cattle (the only stock then present) were removed from the
   island in 1986. In August 1989. a successful programme to eradicate mice
   was implemented, and no mice or their sign have been seen since February
   1990. Since then, the capture rates have increased significantly for C.
   macgregori, the gecko (Hoplodactylus maculatus), and the Cook Strait
   giant weta (Deinacrida rugosa) (Orthoptera). Even though individual C.
   macgregori show strong site fidelity and are potentially long-lived (10+
   years), only three of 64 caught to April 1988 have been recaptured since
   the last mouse was trapped. Adults appeared more vulnerable to predation
   than juveniles. All captures of McGregor's skink on Mana Island were
   made within a small area (<5 ha) along the north-east coast; within this

Abstract = {{A historical review of human activities influencing stream and riparian
   ecosystems in eastern Washington and Oregon shows that cumulative
   effects of resource uses and management over the past two centuries are
   altering the health of many river basins.  Past practices such as
   livestock grazing and forest harvest near riparian areas and streams
   became collectively significant over long time periods and are
   continuing today.  Case histories for the Okanogan and Methow River
   basins (north central Washington), the Naches River (eastern Cascade
   Mountains), and the Grande Ronde and John Day River basins (eastern and
   north central Oregon) provide chronologies of events that shaped the
   present-day landscapes and socio-economic conditions of the region. 
   Historic cumulative effects on stream and riparian ecosystems include
   livestock grazing and mining from the 1860s until about 1910.  Timber
   harvest, roads, fire management, dams, irrigation, and fisheries
   increased in importance during the 20th century.  Management histories
   show minimal actions for reducing damage to stream and riparian
   ecosystems.  Managers commonly perpetuate the notion that streams and
   riparian areas are difficult to manage because little is known about how
   these ecosystems function.  Many agencies strive to develop procedures
   for treating the symptoms of degraded ecosystems while giving little
   consideration to the causes.  Other agencies and public groups concerned
   with conflicting issues like water allocations and minimum instream
   flows for fish usually disagree with plans for resolving these issues. 
   The continuous dissent by these parties only adds to the plight of fish
   as available water and habitats continue to decline.  Alternatively, new
   basin-wide management strategies of federal and environmental
   organizations offer hope for improving the ecosystem biodiversity and
   population levels of fish and wildlife.  Priorities include the
   protection, restoration, and monitoring of habitats and networks that
   connect stream and riparian ecosystems in degraded and intact
   watersheds.  Intact watersheds (e.g., roadless and wilderness areas)
   function as critical habitats and refuge areas for fish and wildlife of
   adjoining ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Counting the adult birds at breeding colonies is the only useful method
   for population monitoring in the Black Guillemot. Before the counts can
   be compared, however, information is needed on the optimal census time.
   Diurnal and seasonal rhythms of colony attendance were studied during
   three summers at Valassaaret, Gulf of Bothnia. The attendance always
   peaked in the early morning, soon after sunrise, and then declined
   sharply. Early morning counts should thus be preferred for monitoring,
   but counts conducted at other times of day can be transformed by use of
   correction factors to estimate the peak numbers. Counts made directly
   from the breeding islands are to be recommended in preference to
   undisturbed counts from a distance. Similar diurnal attendance patterns
   have been found in most study areas in Europe; in seasonal rhythm there
   seems to be more local variation. The biological significance of the
   pronounced early diurnal attendance peak at Black Guillemot colonies is
   discussed briefly.}},

   the European vine moth, Lobesia botrana Den. et Schiff. (LepidopteraL:

   manufactured septa were equally effective in attracting males to traps. 
   Within the range of 0.1 to 100 mug pheromone/dispenser, response of
   males increased positively with the pheromone dose.  Within the first 7
   days tested, pheromone loads of 1 or 10 mg/dispenser were significantly
   less attractive to males than 0.1 mg/dispenser.  The effect of aging of
   the dispenser (loaded with 1 mg pheromone) in the field up trapping
   efficiency was significant.  Captures in traps baited with 4- and
   5-week-old septa were significantly lower (by 24\%) than those in traps
   baited with 1-week-old septa.  The fairly slow loss of attractancy
   exhibited by rubber septa indicates that septa may be kept in traps for
   at least 5 weeks.  The release rate of the pheromone from the Israeli
   dispensers (1 mg loaded) was measured in a flow system.  The emission of
   the pheromone decreased gradually as a function of age, correlating well
   with the lower trap catches of field-aged septa.  Release rates were
   reduced by 56\%, 70\% and 84\% after 4, 5 and 6 weeks, repectively.  The
   nonsticky IPS trap was as effective in capturing the European vine moth
   males as the sticky Pherocon 1C trap.  The possibility of using the
   nonsticky, nonsaturating and easy-to-handle IPS traps may lead to better
   and easier monitoring of the European vine moth populations.}},

   February 1989 through 30 September 1990 hourly from roost to 1200 hours
   (morning) and 1300 hours to roost (afternoon) during spring (1 Feb-31
   May), summer (1 Jun-30 Sep), and fall/winter (1 Oct-31 Jan). Daily mean

Abstract = {{Scent stations are assumed to be a simple and economical method to index
   furbearer populations, but recent literature challenges the reliability
   of this technique. We examined several variables that could affect
   visitation rates of 2 commonly indexed species. Raccoon (Procyon lotor)
   and bobcat (Felis rufus) visitation rates of scent stations were
   monitored on the Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge in western Tennessee
   during summer and fall 1991. Factors tested included placement from
   water and roads, attractant type, and within-habitat variability of
   scent-station visitation rates. Placement of scent stations near water
   (less than or equal to 10 m) increased visitation rates of raccoons.
   Attractant type (visual vs. olfactory) did not affect visitation rates
   of bobcats or raccoons regarding visual attraction to a scent station.
   Differences existed between sites within a habitat for raccoons.
   Variability did not increase with increasing visitation rates in
   raccoons and showed only a slight positive slope in bobcats. Reliability
   of scent station indices may depend on random locations and optimal
   placements and will require standardization of techniques for each
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Bait stations have proven effective in monitoring black bear (Ursus
   americanus) population changes. However, little research has been
   conducted to investigate influences of habitat characteristics on bait
   station visitations. Vegetation (N = 20) and land-use (N = 3) variables
   were evaluated at bait stations visited (N = 27) and not visited (N =
   25) by black bears on 2 islands in Arkansas. Overstory, midstory, and
   understory vegetation composition were assessed by nested circular plots
   centered on bait stations. Distance to nearest road and type and time
   since last timber harvest also were recorded for each site. Vegetative
   composition between visited and not visited bait stations did not differ
   (MRPP, P = 1.00) indicating that site-specific variables measured had no
   influence on probability of a bait station being visited.}},

Abstract = {{The largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fishery and population
   structure at Victor Braunig Reservoir, Texas, were monitored from 1985
   through 1992 following changes in harvest restrictions from 254-mm
   minimum length and 10 fish daily bag limits to 533-minimum length and 2
   fish daily bag limits. Harvest rates were significantly reduced under
   the more restrictive limits and averaged 0.002 fish/angler-hour. Mean
   weight of harvested fish increased from 0.85 kg to 3.22 kg. Total catch
   rates ranged from 0.145 to 0.650 fish/angler-hour; the weighted mean
   annual catch rate during the study was 0.337 fish/angler-hour. Catch
   rates of fish greater than or equal to 533 mm averaged 0.004
   fish/angler-hour. Proportions of larger fish in the creel increased
   throughout the study. Electrofishing surveys showed increases in
   relative proportions of fish greater than or equal to 381 mm, and
   relative abundance of fish greater than or equal to 203 mm increased
   after 1989. Mean lengths-at-capture of age-1 fish declined, but relative
   weights remained above 100 for fish of all sizes. Results suggested
   relatively few largemouth bass recruited to lengths greater than or
   equal to 533 mm. Under the experimental regulations, the largemouth bass
   fishery failed to provide anticipated catch rates of trophy (greater
   than or equal to 3.2 kg) fish, but did provide a quality
   catch-and-release fishery in terms of weight of fish caught per hour.}},

Abstract = {{This laboratory, responsible for the monitoring of radon environmental
   pollution in the Piedmont Region (total area 25,400 km(2), population
   similar to 4.5 million), decided to promote surveys in areas where the
   presence of high radon concentrations is expected. Indoor radon
   concentrations in houses in the village of Peveragno (CN) were studied.
   Peveragno is a small centre (4000 inhabitants) in the western Alps where
   there was a uranium mine until the 1960s and where many water sources
   and wells with a high radon content were found. The measurement
   techniques employed were based on Kodak LR-115 type II etched track
   detectors. The number of houses monitored (during summer 1992) was 86,
   distributed throughout the Peveragno municipality. Usually, two
   dosemeters were employed for each house, one in the lower floor, the
   other in the higher. In special cases cellars were also measured. The
   radon content in public water supplies was also measured. High radon
   levels were found in many cases: about 13\% of all houses monitored
   showed concentrations above the Reference Level of 400 Bq.m(-3), with a
   maximum of over 2400 Bq.m(-3), The results are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 311 commercial beach-seine hauls monitored in False Bay
   between January 1991 and December 1992 yielded 38 930 juvenile teleosts
   from 31 species and 18 families.  Eight teleost species important in
   anglers' catches in the South-Western Cape together provided nearly 60\%
   of the total juvenile catch, of which Rhabdosargus globiceps (22,8\%)
   and Pomatomus saltatrix (20,3\%) were the most abundant.  Mean juvenile
   catch per haul for all species was 125 individuals, mean annual catches
   of juvenile teleosts so amounting to approximately 74 000 individuals. 
   Juvenile teleosts constitute <6\% of the total beach-seine catch in
   False Bay, considerably smaller than the proportion of juveniles in
   other South African commercial and recreational fisheries.  When
   compared to published estimates of natural mortality for juvenile
   teleosts frequenting nearshore sandy beach habitats, potential seine-net
   mortality was calculated to be insignificant for most of the species
   considered.  However, estimated annual catches of juvenile Lithognathus
   lithognathus make up a significant proportion (>30\%) of the total
   surf-zone standing stocks, and it is thought that juveniles of this
   species in False Bay may be under considerable threat because they are
   also caught in large numbers by shore-anglers.}},

Abstract = {{The chronically acid Hovvatn and the adjoining pond Pollen were limed in
   March 1981. During the first 4 yr after the liming, a total of 11437
   brown trout were stocked in the two locations. The fish population was
   monitored by annual testfishing in a five yr period following the
   liming. The stocking material constituted 6 cohorts and included fish
   stocked at age 0+, 1+ and 2+. The stocking program assured a 7.9 times
   higher density of fish ha(-1) in Pollen than in Hovvatn. Consequently,
   the fish from Hovvatn grew significantly better and had a significantly
   higher condition factor than fish in Pollen. Monitoring of water
   chemistry showed that the cohorts were exposed to a gradual
   reacidification process, abrupted by episodic events of severe
   acidification. Within 2-3 yr after the liming, the locations had
   reacidified to conditions which were considered critical for fish.
   However, the acid-induced increase in mortality appeared 1-2 yr later
   than what was expected from water chemistry data. This discrepancy could
   most likely be ascribed to the existence of water chemical refugia which
   enhanced the survival of the fish. Recaptures were significantly
   correlated to pH, Ca, labile-Al and ANC. Growth were significantly
   reduced throughout the reacidification period. Estimated yield showed
   that fish stocked at age 2+, as opposed to fish stocked at a younger
   age, managed to turn the high food availability into high growthrates
   before the reacidification retarded growth and survival.}},

Abstract = {{The Greater Tel-Aviv (Dan Region) urban area is composed of seven
   municipalities producing close to 100 million cubic meters per year
   (mcmy) of wastewaters, serving a population equivalent of over 1.7
   millions. The Dan Region Association of Towns for Sewerage serves the
   largest population, commercial and tourism center of Israel as well as
   an important part of its industry. The flow of wastewater in the region
   is expected to reach some 150 mcmy by the end of this decade due to its
   intensive growth. Due to the perennial and severe shortage of water,
   Israel has adopted a national policy of maximizing wastewater reuse,
   aimed principally at agricultural irrigation of crops without any
   restrictions (including fruits and vegetables eaten uncooked). The
   quality requirements for the reclaimed wastewater are quite stringent,
   due to the fact that a large proportion of the agricultural produce is
   intended for export to foreign countries. The Dan Region Third Line
   scheme is an example of a holistic approach to urban sewerage system
   integrated with reclamation and agricultural reuse, within an overall
   policy-making, engineering design, operation, monitoring, surveillance,
   management, administration and legal framework. It has a combined
   health, environmental and economical benefit to the urban communities
   and critical economic and livelihood benefit to the rural community.}},

   Cryptophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae.
   Downstream, the phytoplankton density increased gradually, while
   Bacillariophyceae tended to dominate. The high densities found in the
   lower R. Rhine represented only a few species of centric
   Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae. The dense blooms of phytoplankton
   in the lower R. Rhine am triggered by the input of phytoplankton from
   the upper reaches and tributaries, and are stimulated by large inputs of
   nutrients. These blooms are accompanied by blooms of zooplankton,
   especially rotifers, Dreissena polymorpha larvae and, in the lower
   Rhine, nauplii larvae. The species composition and biomass of plankton
   in the R. Rhine vary strongly during the year but also between years, as
   indicated for the period 1980-1990. However, the information at the
   species level needs further elaboration to allow interpretation of
   long-term trends. Notably, the input by tributaries should be included.
   To assess these long-term trends we recommend supplementing the
   large-scale biological inventory, as planned for the years 1995 and
   2000, with plankton observations in the years between and investigating
   the relationship between the benthic and pelagic communities of the
   river.}},

   quantify their presence in terms of biomass. In both plants, as the
   concentration of sludge or biofilm increased, the overall biomass of the
   ciliate community increased until reaching the highest values during the
   full-running phase. Ciliate biomass reached values of 250 mg/l (dry
   weight) in the activated sludge and 314 mu g/cm(2) (dry weight) in the
   RBC biofilm. The ciliate biomass/volatile solids ratio was over 9 \% for
   the activated sludge and 12 to 19\% for RBC biofilm. High correlation
   coefficients between ciliate biomass and volatile solids were also
   observed, which emphasized the close association of ciliate populations

Abstract = {{A computer-aided sequencing batch reactor, CA-SBR, was used in order to
   monitor, improve and control the microbial activity for xenobiotics
   degradation. The control parameter for the reactor operation was the
   carbon dioxide evolution rate. Activated sludge was acclimated to
   4-chlorophenol, 4CP, and was used as inoculum for the reactor. A
   specific substrate degradation rate, q(m), of 116 mg 4CP/gMLSS-h was
   obtained for the best conditions using the CA-SBR. Whereas, with a
   24-hour SBR cycle policy, q(m) was 20 mg 4CP/g MLSS-h. The ability of
   acclimated micro-organisms to degrade 4CP decreased as a consequence of
   starvation periods. Inductive enzyme activity decreased by as much as 80
   \% after 6 hours of starvation. Furthermore, a loss of 60 \% in cell
   viability was found after 20 hours of starvation.}},

Abstract = {{The first vortex solids separator facility in Germany for CSO control
   was installed in 1987.             Solids separation efficiency was
   optimized in the hydraulic laboratory using scaled down models and
   artificial tracers to simulate typical sewage particulates.   The
   facility comprises two parallel operating vortex separators servicing an
   impervious area of 11 ha with a population of 1,500 people. The specific
   storage of the facility including the separator volume and in-line pipe
   storage is 7.2 m3/ha, about 1/4 - 1/2 of that required per German
   standards. A multi-year evaluation program was conducted. The first
   phase noted operational reliability, hydraulic loads and overflow
   frequencies. In the second phase pollutant removal efficiencies were
   monitored. The results were favourable indicating that the separator is
   now ready for use.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-year study of Bat and Robertson caves in south-eastern South
   Australia provided information on the microlimatic conditions in a
   maternity cave of the bat Miniopterus schreibersii.  The study also
   monitored changes in the temperature and humidity conditions in what is
   believed to be a former maternity site, Robertson Cave, following
   restoration of the damaged done.  The maternity cave, Bat Cave, was
   characterised by mild hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions, high relative
   humidity, and temperatures in the roosting area of around 30-degrees-C. 
   Accumulated guano deposits had some areas of heat generation, but the
   bats themselves appeared to be the primary modifiers of their own
   microenvironment.  To support this finding, the recapping of Robertson
   Cave resulted in high humidities and a narrow range of temperature
   fluctuations; however, the temperature never reached the levels seen in
   Bat Cave.  Our conclusion that the heat production of the bats
   themselves is the prime factor affecting microclimatic conditions
   necessary for breeding may relate to the observation that few maternity
   sites serve large and widespread populations of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Change in rate of nest predation due to environmental modification is
   considered a major cause of population decline of many bird species. 
   Our ability to adequately understand and effectively manage this effect
   is limited by our ability to identify the relative roles of individual
   nest predators.  This is because nest predation is seldom witnessed
   despite its high frequency.  We describe and evaluate an inexpensive
   photographic technique for identifying nest predators at active nests. 
   Each camera unit (A\$220) was triggered by circuitry (A\$30), using a
   magnetic reed switch attached to a supplementary egg.  A total of 51
   nests of New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) was
   monitored with the equipment.  Of these, 39 were preyed upon.  Predation
   was never witnessed, but predators were captured on film for 72\% of
   nests at which predation occurred.}},

Abstract = {{A simultaneous monitoring system that used a team of local observers to
   count dugongs around Calauit Island, Busuanga, Palawan, Philippines,
   from eight vantage points was employed from March 1989 to May 1990 to
   identify important dugong habitats around the island.  On average, five
   dugongs were seen per survey day.  More dugongs were observed during
   March and July 1989 than in other months.  These periods coincided with
   the bimodal peaking of seagrass biomass in the region and the lull
   between monsoons for that year.  The site where dugongs were most often
   sighted was about 1.5 m deep, had the largest area of seagrass on the
   island (approximately 50 ha) and supported a seagrass (above-ground)
   biomass averaging 1060 g m-2 (wet weight).  The dugongs were shy, making
   observations difficult.  They were observed to graze at the study sites
   once per day, usually starting in the late afternoon or at night. 
   Animals usually stayed on the seaward side of the spur-and-groove
   sections of the reefs.  Short seagrasses such as Halophila ovalis,
   Halodule uninervis, Cymodocea rotundata, C. serrulata, Syringodium
   isoetifolium and Thalassia hemprichii showed more evidence of being
   grazed than the taller Enhalus acoroides.  By direct observations of the
   area grazed by a single dugong, an average consumption rate of 30.5 kg
   (wet weight) of seagrass (above ground only) per day was estimated.  The
   methodology developed in this study may be used to identify reserve
   areas for the protection of dugong habitats in the Philippines.  The
   dugong populations of Palawan require further attention and
   implementation of conservation measures.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes an approach to the monitoring of the condition of a
   relatively well-studied series of lakes, the purpose of which scheme
   sought the optimum combination of high sensitivity and low logistic
   effort. It involves the collection of three samples, corresponding with
   spring, early- and late-summer phytoplankton production, in every fifth
   or sixth year, phytoplankton is enumerated and categorised according to
   size, being < 65 mum or > 65 mum in unit (cell or colony) dimension and
   with an additional category for (larger) `cyanophytes'. Biomass scores
   averaged over the year prove to be very conservative in the lakes of the
   English Lake District, unless they have undergone significant
   eutrophication though (mainly) receiving sewage effluent (i.e.
   mineralised but not nutrient stripped). The method is shown to be
   sensitive to broad differences in trophic status but insufficiently so
   to more subtle changes over a five-year period, unless these are either
   anticipated or confirmed by more intensive study. For background
   monitoring of a previously well-studied lake or lake series, the present
   method should prove adequate.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses of Drunella coloradensis nymphs were examined in
   outdoor experimental stream channels after pH reductions of 1 and 2 pH
   units below ambient.  The severity of pH decline below the ambient of
   7.8 influenced the behavior patterns displayed by nymphs.  At pH 7.01
   (an intermediate pH decline) nymphs sat less frequently and burrowed
   more than controls.  Burrowing behavior frequency returned to control
   levels and drifting and crawling behaviors increased relative to
   controls at pH 6.02.  Ventilatory behaviors increased with pH decline,
   but were independent of the severity of acidity increases.  These
   results suggest that individual behaviors may offer a more sensitive
   indicator of sub-acute stress in aquatic insect communities than
   population or community monitoring.  Behaviors leading to increased
   activity levels in stream insects may have community-level effects via
   changes in predator-prey encounter rates or increased susceptibility to
   passive drift.  These potential changes are discussed in reference to
   monitoring for acidification effects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that information collected in the field of Public
   Health has the potential to provide a valuable contribution to the
   forecasting and evaluation of the impact of climate change. The
   well-developed sets of social and environmental health data collected to
   monitor the health of human populations could also offer sensitive
   indicators of the effects and potential effects of climate change. City
   collections of public health data and general demographic information
   are reviewed as examples of the availability of such monitoring systems.
   The interests of those monitoring climate change and those monitoring
   health march together in other ways as well. Changes in radiation,
   rainfall and temperature will change food and building safety levels, as
   well as waste disposal capacity. People who are on the poverty line or
   ill, or both, have little opportunity to respond to such changes, or the
   strategies designed to control them. Since the Canadian Lalonde Report
   of 1974, health services have increasingly linked their social and
   physical health information to environmental data. Coordinated planning
   using a multidisciplinary data base and responses to change which give
   due regard to equity are both central considerations in responding to
   changes in the environment as well as to risks to human health.}},

Abstract = {{Arthropods, the most diverse component of terrestrial ecosystems, occupy
   a tremendous variety of functional niches and microhabitats across a
   wide array of spatial and temporal scales. We propose that conservation
   biologists should take advantage of terrestrial arthropod diversity as a
   rich data source for conservation planning and management. For reserve
   selection and design, documentation of the microgeography of selected
   arthropod taxa can delineate distinct biogeographic zones areas of
   endemism community types, and centers of evolutionary radiation to
   improve the spatial resolution of conservation planning. For management
   of natural areas, monitoring of terrestrial arthropod indicators can
   provide early warnings of ecological changes, and can be used to assay
   the effects of further fragmentation on natural areas that no longer
   support vertebrate indicator species. Many arthropod indicators respond
   to environmental changes more rapidly than do vertebrate indicators,
   which may exhibit population responses that do not become evident until
   too late for proactive management Not all arthropod taxa are equally
   effective as indicators for conservation planning and the qualities of
   indicators can differ for purposes of inventory versus monitoring.
   Assemblages of arthropod taxa used as biogeographic probes in
   inventories should exhibit relatively high species diversity, high
   endemism, and encompass the geographic range of interest. For monitoring
   purposes, indicator assemblages should exhibit varying sensitivity to
   environmental perturbations and a diversity of life-history and
   ecological preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike other regions of North America, forested habitats in New England
   have increased substantially in the past 100 years. The proportion of
   land in New Hampsbire covered by forests was 47\% in 1880 and 87\% in
   1980. This increase was largely the result of a region-wide abandonment
   of farms and the subsequent colonization of these lands by second-growth
   forests. I examined the sequence of farm abandonment, forest
   colonization, and forest maturation that occurred in New Hampshire in
   relation to changes in the abundance and distribution of a group of
   forest mammals and birds that have undergone substantial declines. A
   modeled pattern of secondary succession resulted in the availability of
   approximately 195,000 ha of early seral habitats (10-25 years after
   abandonment) from 1905 to 1940 These habitats then matured into
   closed-canopy forests by about 1960. Concurrent to the loss of early
   successional habitats, populations of New England cottontails
   (Sylvilagus transitionalis) decreased from an apparent continuous
   distribution throughout 60\% of New Hampshire to fragmented populations
   that occupy less than 20\% of the state. Bobcats (Felis rufus) responded
   functionally (S. transitionalis in diet: 1951-1954 = 43\%, 1961-1964 =
   10\%) and numerically (mean annual harvest of bobcats: 1951-1954 = 350,
   1965-1969 = 36) to changes in cottontail abundance. Eighteen of 26
   species of migratory passerines that nest in the forests of northern New
   England also declined during the period their populations were monitored
   (1934-1987). Eight (44\%) of the species that declined are associated
   with early successional habitats, and these species consistently
   exhibited population declines during the 1950s. The reduction of early
   successional species may be extended in space and time by current land
   uses that fragment and isolate patches of habitat. Ownership patterns of
   forest lands in New England (excluding Maine) reveal 88\% private
   ownership with an average bolding of 10 ba This suggests that large
   tracts of early successional habitats will be restricted to industrial
   and state/national forests. Although even-aged management of a portion
   of these forests may be perceived as incompatible with area-sensitive
   and interior species, clustering of clearcuts and maintaining large
   tracts of mature habitats could sustain diverse populations of forest
   vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{To determine whether an economically important moth species emigrates
   from the western Com Belt (Iowa and Missouri) to the gulf coastal areas
   of Louisiana and Texas each autumn, adult populations of Agrotis ipsilon
   (Hufnagel) males were monitored with traps baited with female sex
   pheromone, 16 July to 31 October 1986-1987. Concurrently, to estimate
   the potential for southward displacement of A. ipsilon, moths marked
   with a vital dye, Calco Red N-1700, were released at dusk 28 September
   and 2 October 1986, and 10 and 17 September 1987, from Ankeny, Iowa.
   Increased nightly moth-capture in Texas was positively related to
   numbers of nights with near-surface (100-300 m) northerly airflow
   (southward displacement of air) and decreased moth-capture in the
   western Corn Belt. Capture in Louisiana was also negatively correlated
   with capture of moths in the western Com Belt. The recapture in autumn
   1986 of two moths in Missouri, 397 km and 460 km south of the release
   site, respectively, was possible because of nightly near-surface
   northerly airflow. Near-surface northerly airflow the night of and
   subsequent to 17 September 1987 was responsible for a marked moth being
   recaptured near Neota, Illinois, and another being recaptured near
   Brownsville, Texas, 276 km southeast and 1900 km southwest of the
   release site, respectively. We conclude that during late summer and
   autumn, A., ipsilon, and probably other insect species, respond to
   deteriorating environmental conditions by using certain weather systems
   with northerly (southward displacement) near-surface airflow to complete
   midcontinental migrations to more favorable areas.}},

   northern Australia between the 400 mm and 1000 mm isohyets; they are
   separated by 200 km of unsuitable habitat. The history of settlement,
   land degradation and the current status of these birds is dealt with in
   five localities. The Kimberleyan subspecies is estimated to be below
   7000 individuals, to be vulnerable and in need of conservation measures.
   The Carpentarian subspecies is at least twice as numerous and is not
   threatened at present; its future status will need monitoring because of
   its restricted habitat. In the past decade several new national parks
   that are strategically well placed for populations of M. coronatus have
   been gazetted. Even more importantly, land management appears to be
   moving out of the exploitive, habitat degrading stage towards practices
   that minimise erosion and maintain the riverside as a renewable
   resource. This should benefit the survival of the species, especially M.
   c. coronatus.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility has been investigated of using the PIXE method to yield
   long and reliable time series for indicating changes in the environment,
   with moths or butterflies as a sample target. The suitability of this
   approach was demonstrated by studying standard deviations of
   measurements of single moths and those of populations of moths. The
   properties of targeting at different anatomical sites were investigated
   and the wing gave the most stable results, perhaps because its metabolic
   development is completed ar the imago (newborn butterfly) stage.
   According to test measurements of different populations it seems
   possible to use moth or butterfly wing measurements to study
   environmental changes over the past century or so using moth or
   butterfly collections.}},

Abstract = {{A probability-based sample of 48 of the 152 lakes in the Sawtooth
   Wilderness, Idaho was conducted in summer 1988. Results from this sample
   were compared to the Environmental Protection Agency's 1985 probability
   survey of lakes throughout the western United States, which included 17
   lakes in the Sawtooth Wilderness. Although methods differed in several
   respects, including year, season, sampling location within the lakes,
   holding times, and sample size, general characterization of lake
   chemistry for the population of lakes in the wilderness based on the two
   surveys was very similar. The results indicate that general lake
   characterization in difficult-to-access wilderness areas of the West can
   be achieved with a modest investment in resources with the use of
   volunteers. However, accurate measurement of some non-conservative and
   low-level analytes such as NO3-,NH4+, total P, and aluminiun in the
   lakes probably requires more rigorous attention to sampling protocols
   and holding times. A two-stage sampling strategy employing extensive use
   of conductivity on a large number of lakes and intensive detailed
   chemical characterization on a smaller number of lakes offers an
   alternative design for describing large populations of wilderness lakes.
   The relatively high concentrations of fluoride and sulfate in many of
   the study lakes reflect the weathering of minerals not usually
   identified on geologic maps. These natural sources of acid anions
   violate the assumptions in commonly employed empirical models of
   acidification.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands have been intricately linked with humankind throughout the
   ages. Evidence of rice culture dates to the earliest age of humans, long
   before the era of historical records. Drain-field and raised-field
   agriculture occurred in wetlands throughout large areas of Mesoamerica
   before Hispanic exploration of the region. About 40\% of the world's
   population uses rice as a major staple; rice culture currently occupies
   about 15\% of the world's wetland area. Wetlands are valued for high
   biological productivity; as filters, sinks, and transformers for
   sediments, nutrients, and pollutants; and as buffers between aquatic
   systems and human activities on upland areas. Because of their varied
   ecological functions, wetlands are of interest to ecotoxicologists as
   potential sites for detoxifying pollutants. Estimates are that wetlands
   occupy about 3 to 6\% of the world's land area. Attempts to define,
   delineate, monitor, and regulate the use of wetlands in the United
   States have proven to be extremely complex. Considerable progress has
   been made in classifying and monitoring changes in wetland areas on a
   nationwide basis, but less success has been achieved in defining and
   delineating wetlands. The United States experience should be a useful
   model for developing countries to study as they attempt to deal with
   wetland management and protection. As long as the world's population
   continues to grow at exponential rates, it seems highly probable that
   pressure to use wetlands to meet society's demands will increase.
   Consequently, opportunities to set aside reserves will decrease, and the
   role that wetlands play in maintaining quality of life will depend more
   and more on our collective ability to develop and promote compatible
   uses on wetlands.}},

Abstract = {{Selective predation on certain sex or age components within prey
   populations may greatly affect prey population dynamics. We studied
   predation by the pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum on the different social
   groups of the field vole Microtus agrestis during the autumn after a
   peak year of cyclic microtine populations in central Finland. The
   availability of prey was monitored on a trapping grid consisting of
   field and forest habitats. The diet of the pygmy owl was studied in
   three separate areas with boxes available as food storage for the owls.
   Relatively more male field voles were taken than would be expected on
   the basis of their availability in the prey population. On average,
   males moved shorter distances than females during a trapping night,
   which indicates that the vulnerability of males is not due to their
   greater activity. Both the males and the females in the diet were
   lighter and obviously younger than the average of the prey populations.
   Lighter individuals in the population preferred the forest which is a
   suboptimal habitat for the field voIe. Trappability, which measures
   social dominance, was lower among these lighter individuals. Subordinate
   individuals are obviously more exposed to predation by the pygmy owl in
   a forest habitat, which offers less shelter in late autumn. Due to the
   density-dependent mortality they cause, avian predators have been
   thought to dampen fluctuations in the vole population. We discuss how
   the distinct choice of certain class of prey affects the interaction
   between avian predators and small mammal prey.}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation and fragmentation of tropical forests continues at
   alarming rates, resulting in problems ranging from species extinction to
   global environmental changes. Central to conservation science is the use
   of population biology studies for management and preservation of
   specific species. In this paper, two basic aspects of population biology
   - demography and genetics - of tropical plant populations are reviewed
   to assess the present state of knowledge, and its potential Implications
   for the conservation of tropical tress. Data on demography of tropical
   plants populations is obtained from complete or partial demographic
   studies on specific plants and from long-term surveys monitoring large
   plots of tropical forests. From these studies mortality schedules and
   growth and reproduction performance of several plant species have been
   obtained, providing a good picture of demographic patterns in tropical
   plants. In contrast, genetic studies of tropical plants are scarce.
   Those that do exist have focused on estimations of outcrossing rates,
   genetic diversity and the extent of genetic differentation between
   populations using isozyme markers. Future research in this area is
   needed to provide reliable proposals for the conservation biology of
   tropical trees. Meanwhile, strong efforts should be made to avoid the
   irrational destruction of remnant forests. Sociological, political and
   economical problems are intrinsically involved in conservation biology
   issues and, it is unlikely that the problem of conserving the remaining
   tropical forests will be solved if people's behavior and situation do
   not change.}},

   mites falling to the bottom of the hive. Mites in the debris were
   counted periodically on the plastic sheet on which they were collected.
   Two months later, colonies were treated with an acaricide to determine
   mite population. A high positive correlation was found between the
   number of mites collected in the hive debris over different periods and
   the final population size. Based on this correlation, it was possible to
   use hive debris counts to predict the degree of infestation.
   Furthermore, counting fallen mites over a period of two months, followed
   by an acaricide treatment, might be a useful method of estimating the
   rate of growth of V. jacobsoni in honeybee colonies.}},

Abstract = {{The residual pheromone content of laminated plastic,
   pheromone-dispensing tapes impregnated with (+)-disparlure, the sex
   pheromone of the gypsy moth, Lymantria diapar (L.), was assessed after
   exposure to field conditions in Gainesville. As determined by gas
   chromatography, lure tapes deployed on 26 August 1991 rapidly lost
   pheromone during the first 2 months in the field. Loss of pheromone was
   considerably less for the remaining 4-month exposure period (28 October
   1991 to 3 March 1992). Lure tapes at 5 locations differed slightly in
   their rates of pheromone loss, and traps placed on the north side of
   tree trunks retained more pheromone than traps placed on the south side.
   These data indicate that a pheromone lure used for monitoring gypsy moth
   during spring and early summer in north Florida may lose its
   effectiveness rapidly and may have to be replaced more often than is
   currently recommmended for other regions of the country.}},

Abstract = {{1. In a study of five ponds sensitive to acid precipitation, we document
   seasonal acidification profiles and assess the impact of short-term acid
   pulses on the reproductive success of resident sunfish (Lepomis spp.).
   2. Three years of water sampling at 2-3 week intervals showed
   substantial seasonal variation in pH and alkalinity consistent with a
   carbonate buffering system. Though all ponds shared a common seasonal
   pattern in pH, ponds with relatively low pH and alkalinity showed the
   greatest variation in these parameters. Spring minima may dispose some
   of the ponds towards episodes of extreme acidity during heavy spring
   rains. 3. Otolith analysis of young-of-the-year sunfish revealed
   recruitment failures for eggs laid early in spring in ponds with
   relatively low alkalinity and pH, and, in the most extreme case, missing
   day classes at subsequent irregular intervals even though average pH and
   alkalinity were well above those demonstrated to affect centrarchid
   fishes. 4. Age-class distributions of sunfishes revealed gaps in adult
   age distributions which could be traced through 3 years of the study,
   but there was no clear-cut relationship between pond acidification and
   the age structure of adult fish. 5. Seasonal profiles of acidity may
   enable researchers to predict the time during which a pond or lake may
   be highly sensitive to acid inputs. Comparative otolith analysis of
   young-of-the-year fishes and short-term continuous monitoring of water
   chemistry may provide an early warning of biological effects of
   acidification in sensitive bodies of water.}},

   (approximately 15 x 10 x 3 m) in Piraeus (southern Greece) for 15 months
   (Oct. 1990 through Dec. 1991). Continuous captures of L. serricorne on
   multisurface traps and Lasiotraps with and without addition of 10 mg
   anhydroserricornin (2,6-diethyl-3,5-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran)
   revealed a total catch of 720 662 tobacco beetles on 2 pheromone-baited
   multisurface traps, 2 pheromone-baited Lasiotraps as well as 2
   multisurface traps and 2 Lasiotraps without pheromone addition.  The 2
   pheromone-baited multisurface traps caught 501 481 tobacco beetles
   (approximately 69.6 \%), while the 2 unbaited multisurface traps caught
   131 865 L. serricirne (approximately 18.3 \%).  However, the 2
   Lasiotraps with pheromone addition captured 59 265 tobacco beetles
   (approximately 8.2 \%), whereas the 2 Lasiotraps without pheromone
   caught 28 051 tobacco beetles (approximately 3.9 \%) only (table 2).  It
   follows that pheromone-baited multisurface traps caught approximately
   3.8 times more L. serricorne than multisurface traps lacking pheromone,
   while multisurface traps provided with pheromone captured approximately
   8.5 times more tobacco beetles than pheromone-baited Lasiotraps. 
   Moreover, pheromone-baited multisurface traps caught approximately 17.8
   times more L. serricorne than pheromone-free Lasiotraps.
   It was concluded that multisurface traps (baited with 10 mg of
   anhydroserricornin) are very useful for mass-trapping of male L.
   serricorne and can promote insectistasis of this species in tobacco
   stores. Lasiotraps (baited with 10 mg of anhydroserricornin), having
   only one fifth the adhesive surface of multisurface traps, can detect
   infestations by tobacco beetles as early as multisurface traps and can
   thus be employed for monitoring populations of L. serricorne.
   The superiority of pheromone-baited multisurface traps over
   pheromone-baited Lasiotraps depends on the more efficient mass-trapping
   of male L. serricorne by the former, which is essentially due to their
   enlarged adhesive surface being vertically suspended around a concentric
   pheromone source.  The elevated attractiveness of pheromone-baited
   multisurface traps is probably based on combined sensory stimulation of
   male tobacco beetles following simultaneous exposure to figural and
   pheromone stimuli acting in a synergistic optical-olfactory
   relationship.}},

Abstract = {{1 Oak woodlands in California intermingle with annual grasslands. They
   frequently have a grassy understorey, which has a distinct species
   composition and abundance unlike adjacent open communities. Soil blocks
   were reciprocally transplanted in autumn (at seed stage) between oak
   understorey and open grassland. Changes in species composition and
   species population densities were monitored over the following two
   years.
   2 Species composition of adult plants in the reciprocally transplanted
   soil blocks resembled the original `donor' seed bank in the first spring
   after transplant, but in the second year it was not very different from
   the surrounding community in the `receptor' habitat.
   3 In the soil blocks transplanted from the open grassland to the oak
   understorey, overall abundance was severely reduced after two years, and
   light-exigent species like Lolium multiflorum, Bromus mollis and
   Hypochoeris glabra were eliminated. When understorey plots, which had
   low initial seed reserves, were reciprocally transplanted into the open
   grassland, they were readily colonized by the high seed producers Lolium
   multiflorum and Bromus mollis, which outcompeted shade-tolerant species
   like Montia perfoliata and Galium aparine. However, Stellaria media,
   with a persistent seed bank, still survived and reproduced after two
   years in the open grassland.
   4 In a second experiment, soil blocks from both habitats were
   transplanted onto the top of an uniform soil base in large boxes in a
   fenced experimental site, and half of them were then subjected to
   artificial dense shade. Total plant density was severely reduced by
   shading, although Bromus diandrus, Carduus pycnocephalus and Stellaria
   media were the species least affected.
   5 Half of the shaded and full-sun plots in the uniform soil were clipped
   periodically. Avena fatua dominated the full-sun, unclipped plots, while
   adult plant densities of Lolium multiflorum, Bromus mollis and B.
   diandrus increased with the clipping treatment.
   6 Reduced radiation under evergreen oak canopy caused high seedling
   mortality of the transplanted open species and seems the main factor
   precluding their distribution in the oak woodland. This hypothesis is
   further supported by the finding that artificial shading severely
   reduced the seedling density of open species. Reciprocally, strong
   interference by dominant tall grasses seems to limit the establishment
   of understorey species in the open grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Between May, 1988, and July, 1992, the University of Missouri Plant
   Nematode Diagnostic Laboratory collected data on Heterodera glycines
   populations in Missouri by offering diagnostic services to soybean
   farmers. A greenhouse bioassay (free), egg count (\$10/sample), and race
   determination test (\$25) were conducted by request on soil samples
   submitted to the lab. Each test was offered for a specific purpose: the
   bioassay for fields not known to be infested; the egg count for
   population monitoring in fields with known infestations; and the race
   test for fields with a history of resistant cultivars. Of 818 samples
   submitted for bioassay on a H. glycines-susceptible soybean cultivar, 13
   (1.6\%) contained brown cysts but no white females, and 364 (45\%)
   contained white females after 35 days in the greenhouse. Of 6,193 egg
   counts, 39\% were either free of H. glycines or contained fewer than 500
   eggs/250 cm(3) soil, the action threshold for Missouri. The remaining
   61\% ranged from 500-400,000 eggs/250 cm(3) soil (mean = 10,617). Eleven
   races were detected, with races 3 (45\%) and 1 (23\%) the most common.
   The data show that H. glycines is widespread in Missouri (with confirmed
   infestations in 80 of 114 counties), that most infested fields have
   population densities above the action threshold, and that there is
   considerable genetic diversity among H. glycines field populations.}},

   Park, California from 1985 to 1992. While abundances of barnacles
   (Balanus, Tetraclita, and Chthamalus), mussels (Mytilus californianus)
   algae (Pelvetia fastigiata, Hesperophycus harveyanus, and Endocladia
   muricata), and owl limpets (Lottia gigantea) remained relatively stable,
   black abalone populations declined precipitously, with less than 10\% of
   the 1985 levels present in 1992. At the southeastern islands, in the
   warm waters of the Californian Province, 90\% of the abalone died
   between 1985 and 1988, and the proportion of large individuals among
   survivors increased as the population declined to less than 1\% of its
   1985 level. In contrast, populations at the northwestern islands, in the
   cold water of the Oregonian Province, declined gradually, until after
   the southeastern islands' populations crashed and were closed to
   commercial harvest in 1991. The proportion of large individuals declined
   as abundance dropped at the northwestern islands, implicating harvest as
   a contributing factor in the decline there. In both Provinces,
   recruitment of juvenile abalone virtually ceased when adult populations
   dropped below 50\% of their initial abundance. Withered and weak abalone
   were frequently observed, suggesting an infectious agent. No single
   cause for the mass mortalities has been found to date.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of spatial heterogeneity on the population dynamics of a
   naturally occurring invertebrate host-pathogen system was experimentally
   investigated. At ten week intervals over a two year period, I quantified
   the spatial distribution of natural populations of the terrestrial
   isopod crustacean Porcellio scaber infected with the isopod iridescent
   virus (IIV). During the seasonally dry periods of summer and early fall
   in central California, isopod populations were highly aggregated and the
   degree of patchiness and distance between inhabited patches was
   greatest. Coincident with increased patchiness and patch spacing was an
   increase in isopod density within patches. During the wet seasons of
   winter and spring, isopod population patchiness, inter-patch spacing,
   and within-patch density was low. Seasonal changes in virus prevalence
   were negatively correlated with within-patch density, patchiness, and
   inter-patch spacing. The influence of the spatial distribution of
   isopods on virus prevalence was also tested in field experiments. The
   virus was introduced into arrays of artificial habitat patches colonized
   by isopods in which inter-patch distance was varied. The prevalence of
   resulting infections was monitored at weekly intervals. In addition,
   dispersal rates between artificial patches and natural patches were
   quantified and compared. The results showed that isopods in treatments
   with the smallest inter-patch spacing had the highest virus prevalence,
   with generally lower prevalence among isopods in more widely spaced
   patches. The spacing of experimental patches significantly affected
   virus prevalence, although the experiments did not resolve a clear
   relationship between patch spacing and virus prevalence. Rates of
   dispersal between patches decreased with increased patch spacing, and
   these rates did not differ significantly from dispersal between natural
   patches. The results suggest that rates of dispersal between isopod
   subpopulations may be an important component of the infection dynamics
   in this system. I discuss the consequences of these findings for
   host-pathogen dynamics in fragmented habitats, and for other ecological
   interactions in spatially heterogeneous habitats.}},

Abstract = {{I tested the following hypotheses of territorial polygyny on badgers
   (Taxidea taxus: Carnivora; Mustelidae): Competition among adult females
   for food should result in intrasexual territoriality, while male
   competition for females should result in larger territories that
   encompass multiple female territories. The sagebrush-grassland study
   area (Wyoming, USA) contained a depauperate terrestrial fauna with a
   dense badger population preying on high densities of ground squirrels
   (Spermophilus armatus). Implant telemetry generated locations for
   analysis of home range and spatio-temporal interaction. During the
   summer breeding season males doubled movement rates and nearly tripled
   home range areas to overlap those of females. Before and after the
   breeding season, males reduced their home ranges to sizes nearer those
   of stable female ranges ((\$) over bar x = 2.82 km(2)). Unexpectedly,
   home range overlap between males and females was no different than
   intrasexual overlap. However, analysis of spatio-temporal interaction
   revealed that females spatially avoided one another, while males were
   spatially and temporally attracted to one another, similar to that of
   male-female interactions. Presumably, olfactory mechanisms allow
   resource tracking and lagged communication. Male-male territoriality was
   not viable, most likely because the high density of badgers, combined
   with the severely male-biased sex ratio (1.75:1), effectively increased
   intruder pressure - as a resource, receptive females were too mobile and
   spatially unpredictable within their home ranges. Consequently, males
   monitored and searched widely for relatively scarce females during the
   breeding season with the effect of attracting each other. Male mobility,
   home range size, and possibly aggression increased with age, suggesting
   age-related breeding tactics, although dominance could only be surmised.
   This and other studies suggest how the spatial, temporal, and dominance
   components of carnivore resource partitioning and sociality will be
   understood better by unraveling the interplay of olfactory processes,
   attributes of disparate resources (e.g., food vs. females), seasonality,
   and population density and age-sex structure.}},

   IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF POPULATIONS OF
   ACANTHOSCELIDES ALBOSCUTELLATUS (COLEOPTERA, BRUCHIDAE)}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},

Abstract = {{This study provides an example of how variation in the quality of
   overwintering sites provided by the host plant of an insect seed
   predator can influence both the probability of overwintering survival
   and the size and composition of postwintering populations. Thus, the
   concept of host plant quality is extended to include variation in the
   suitability of the overwintering site of temperate region insects that
   overwinter within, or in habitats created by, their host plant. Adult
   Acanthoscelides alboscutellatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae)
   overwinter inside the fruit of Ludwigia alternifolia (L.) (Onagraceae).
   In early winter, however, fruits begin to dehisce, i.e., one or more of
   the fruit's four sides and/or top are shed. Variation in the onset and
   extent of dehiscence creates a range of overwintering habitats that vary
   in exposure to ambient conditions. In this study the frequency of
   possible overwintering sites in natural populations of L. alternifolia
   was determined by monitoring the phenology of fruit dehiscence from
   October through May in two populations for four years and for a third
   population for three years. Winter survivorship of adult A.
   alboscutellatus was assessed experimentally in eight environments
   representative of the conditions created by variation in dehiscence.
   These environments were produced by crossing four levels of exposure
   (degree of dehiscence) with two locations of the overwintering site,
   i.e., above or on the ground surface. The onset, phenology, and overall
   frequency of fruit dehiscence varied markedly among populations and
   years. Exposure, location, and their interaction had strong effects on
   survival and accounted for 80\% of the observed variation in winter
   survival. Survivorship was higher on than above the ground, and in both
   locations decreased with increasing exposure. Thus, variation in fruit
   dehiscence among L. alternifolia populations will influence the size of
   postwintering A. alboscutellatus populations by dictating the quality of
   overwintering sites. Adult beetles that overwinter inside indehiscent
   fruit experience selection for small body size, associated with high
   mortality, when they attempt to exit the fruit at eclosion. As a
   consequence, the frequency of fruit dehiscence at eclosion coupled with
   the relative survival rates of adults within indehiscent fruit will
   determine the body size composition of postwintering populations and
   hence the response to selection for small body size in this species.}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments was carried out to investigate the nature and
   controls (oxygen, microbial populations, agitation) on the degradation
   of soft tissues. Decay was monitored in terms of morphological change,
   weight loss, and change in chemical composition in the polychaete Nereis
   virens. Polychaetes include a range of tissue types of differing
   chemical composition and preservation potential: muscle, cuticle, setae,
   and jaws. Regardless of conditions, all the muscle had broken down and
   fluid loss through the ruptured cuticle had reduced the carcass to two
   dimensions within 8 days at 20-degrees-C. In most cases some cuticle, in
   addition to the jaws and setae, remained after 30 days. Where oxygen was
   completely eliminated, the rate of decay of the more volatile issues was
   significantly reduced. The degree of both osmotic uptake of water by the
   carcass and changes in water pH differed depending on whether the system
   was open or closed to oxygen diffusion. Autolytic and chemical processes
   are not sufficient to fully degrade the carcass in the absence of
   bacteria. Where internal bacteria are present, the presence or absence
   of water column bacteria made little difference to decay rate. Initial
   degradation (in the first 3 days) affects mainly the lipid fraction and
   the collagen of the cuticle. Later decay reduces the nonsoluble protein
   and increases the relative proportion of refractory structural
   components (tanned chitin and collagen) to more than 95\% by day 30.
   Thus, only the sclerotized tissues are likely to survive beyond 30 days
   in the absence of early diagenetic mineralization. The sequence of
   degradation predicted from the relative decay resistance of
   macromolecules in the sedimentary record (protein - carbohydrate -
   lipid) is not, therefore, a consistent indicator of the preservation
   potential of structural tissues which incorporate them.
   The experiments reveal five stages in the decay of polychaete carcasses;
   whole/shriveled, flaccid, unsupported gut, cuticle sac, jaws and setae.
   All are represented in the fossil record. This allows an estimation of
   how far decay proceeded before it was halted by the fossilization
   process. The most complete preservations occur in the Cambrian where the
   Burgess Shale preserves evidence of muscle tissues. Traces of the gut
   and cuticle are more widely preserved, as at Mazon Creek, Gres a
   Voltzia, Solnhofen, and Hakel. Preservation varies within
   Konservat-Lagerstatten. The most common whole body preservation includes
   only the more recalcitrant tissues, jaws (where present) and setae, with
   an impression of the body outline. The stage of decay can be used as a
   taphonomic threshold, to provide an indication of how significantly the
   diversity of an exceptionally preserved biota is likely to have been
   reduced by taphonomic loss.}},

Abstract = {{Gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar L., were accidentally introduced into the
   United States from Europe more than a century ago and have become a
   major forest pest in eastern North America. Recently, concern has arisen
   over possible establishment of gypsy moths of Asian origin in western
   North America. Because Asian moths have distinctive ecological and
   behavioral characteristics, it is essential to monitor their presence.
   Identification of pheromone-trapped males based on morphology is not
   straightforward, but comparisons of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
   restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and sequences reveal
   diagnostic differences between Asian and North American haplotypes. An
   mtDNA survey of moths trapped in the Pacific Northwest in 1990 and.1991
   documents the presence of moths of Asian origin at several sites in
   North America. These results provided the basis for undertaking efforts
   in 1992 to eradicate gypsy moth populations of Asian origin in both the
   United States and Canada:}},

Abstract = {{Maize seedlings were grown in soil mixed with coal fly ash at rates of
   35 t/ha, 70 t/ha, and 500 t/ha. Nuclei were isolated from the seedlings
   and analyzed by flow cytometry. Nuclei from seedlings grown in 70 t/ha
   and 500 t/ha fly ash had significantly higher fluorescence intensities
   when stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry than
   control plants. This increase in fluorescence intensity is correlated
   with alterations of the plant nucleus. Mean coefficients of variation of
   the G1 peaks were also increased in the fly ash treatments relative to
   controls. The high concentration of fly ash disrupted the cell cycle of
   seedlings, resulting in a higher frequency of G2 nuclei. Additionally,
   three triploid plants were found in the fly ash treatments. Despite the
   nuclear alterations, plants grown at 70 t/ha of fly ash appeared
   healthy. Thus, nuclear damage was evident at levels that do not
   significantly alter the phenotype. Because fly ash was revealed to
   induce nuclear changes in maize plants, its environmental safety should
   be carefully evaluated. Short-term field observation studies are
   inadequate for predicting the long-term consequences of large scale land
   application of this coal combustion product. In addition, the maize line
   used in this study has the potential to be used as a bioassay in
   monitoring potential contamination of land surrounding fly ash landfills
   and disposal ponds.}},

Abstract = {{A method for censusing upland breeding waders using constant search
   effort is described. Estimates of the size of breeding wader populations
   obtained using this method were usually underestimates compared to those
   derived from more intensive studies. In a sample of 28 fields, the
   numbers of breeding Lapwings Vanellus vanellus were underestimated by an
   average of 49\%. This error was consistent across a range of breeding
   densities, thus allowing correction of the original population
   estimates. Further validation studies are required for other species.
   Using the method a single field worker can survey approximately 80 km(2)
   in a single breeding season. The method is well suited to extensive
   survey and may also be of value in the long-term monitoring of upland
   breeding wader populations.}},

Abstract = {{Chamaecrista chamaecristoides is a legume endemic to the coastal sand
   dunes along the coasts of Mexico. Hard-coat dormancy of seeds is broken
   through naturally occurring temperature fluctuations, and seedlings can
   emerge and establish throughout the year. In the study site, winter
   storms (called Nortes) are responsible for moving large quantities of
   sand that bury young seedlings. The objectives of the study were (i) to
   elucidate the timing of seedling emergence, (ii) to investigate the
   effect of date of emergence on seedling survival, and (iii) to evaluate
   different factors of mortality. Seedling survival was monitored under
   natural conditions, from January 1988 to April 1991. Survivorship curves
   were compared using the log-rank Peto and Peto test. It was found that
   the probability of survival or reproduction was not strictly determined
   by chronological age but by size. Larger sized seedlings survived better
   during the Nortes. Timing of germination has a great impact on C.
   chamaecristoides populations, since it affects seedling growth
   possibilities and thus survival and reproduction. In a changing
   environment like the sand dunes, there seems to be a selective advantage
   for maintaining cohorts germinating during different seasons of the
   year.}},

Abstract = {{Data from allele frequencies of wintering American wigeon (Anas
   americana) from the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas were used to
   monitor changes in genetic characteristics of the wintering population
   through time, and to estimate the average proportion of total genetic
   variation partitioned among parent breeding populations. Wigeon were
   surveyed electrophoretically for genetic variation at 25 biochemical
   loci. Changes in total gene diversity were observed throughout the study
   period (5 October 1988 to 15 March 1989) at numerous loci. Significant
   temporal changes in the genetic composition of the wintering population
   were detected, and a minimum of 7\% of the total genetic variation in
   these wigeon was thought to be partitioned among the breeding
   populations represented on the SHP. A new influx of migrating wigeon,
   weather-related movements of wigeon, or spatial subdivision of breeding
   populations on the SHP may be responsible for shifts observed in the
   genetic characteristics of the wintering population. Significant
   heterozygote deficiencies in the sample of wintering wigeon suggest that
   this species maintains some degree of genetic structure on the breeding
   grounds. Genetic data collected from wintering waterfowl may provide
   minimum expectations of the degree of genetic subdivision among breeding
   populations and may help waterfowl biologists to detect changes in the
   composition of wintering waterfowl populations through time.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of Hurricanes Gilbert (1988) and Hugo (1989) on echinoderm
   assemblages were assessed in backreef habitats in Jamaica and St. Croix,
   respectively. One site on each island was censused before the
   hurricanes. Ophiuroids were monitored at the Jamaican site for three
   years following Hurricane Gilbert, and ophiuroids and echinoids were
   monitored at the site on St. Croix for two years following Hurricane
   Hugo. No hurricane-related changes in ophiuroid abundance were observed
   at either site. Likewise, there was no evidence that Hurricane Hugo
   altered echinoid abundance at St. Croix. These negative results
   correlated with an observed lack of hurricane-generated physical
   disturbance in the backreef areas, despite 6-m waves that broke on the
   reef crests at the two sites during the storms. Hurricane im acts on
   mobile faunas appear to depend directly on physical habitat alterations.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to catastrophic impacts from storms, disease epidemics and
   bleaching events, little is known about the effects of more routine
   chronic mortality in reef corals. To monitor this ongoing mortality,
   monthly visual assessments of the cause of tissue damage were related to
   mortality rates (changes in planar surface area) of tagged colonies of
   three common reef corals: Montastrea annularis, Porites astreoides and
   Diploria strigosa at Buck island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, US
   Virgin Islands. During the study Hurricane Hugo, the most powerful
   cyclone to affect the area in at least 60 y, made a direct impact on the
   site. Effects of the hurricane were extremely localized, with certain
   exposed sites being almost completely razed while others showed no
   detectable changes in community structure. Mortality caused both by the
   hurricane and by other factors during the 26 month study varied between
   species and also between site locations around the island. Differences
   in susceptibility were not dependent solely on gross morphology, because
   two robust, massive species showed opposite responses to hurricane
   damage and chronic mortality. Diploria strigosa was virtually unaffected
   by chronic factors, but was heavily damaged at exposed sites during the
   hurricane. In contrast, mortality from predation and tissue necrosis was
   high in Montastrea annularis, but it largely escaped damage from the
   hurricane because it was absent from the most severely scoured
   locations. Porites astreoides, with populations dominated by much
   smaller colonies, was affected by both chronic and hurricane-related
   mortality. Differences in susceptibility to the various types of natural
   disturbance among species, coupled with high spatial and temporal
   variability in the effects of such disturbances, may be critical to the
   maintenance of species diversity on the reef.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife conservation policy for endangered species restoration follows
   a six-phase process. Population viability analysis (PVA) can play a
   major contributing role in four of these. PVA, as discussed here, is a
   technique where extinction vulnerabilities of small populations are
   estimated using computer simulation modeling. The benefits and
   limitations of using PVA in wildlife decision and policy processes are
   reviewed based on our direct experience. PVA permits decision makers to
   set time frames for management, estimate the required magnitude of
   restoration efforts, identify quantitative targets for species recovery,
   and select, implement, monitor, and evaluate management strategies. PVA
   is of greatest value for rare species policy and management. However, a
   limitation of PVA simulation models is that they are constrained by the
   amount of biological data available, and such data are difficult to
   obtain from small populations that are at immediate risk of extinction.
   These problems may be overcome with improved models and more data. Our
   experience shows benefits of PVA far outweigh its limitations, and
   applications of the approach are most useful when integrated with
   decision analysis and completed within an adaptive management
   philosophy. PVAs have been carried out for 14 Victorian species and less
   used elsewhere in Australia. Management and recovery plans are developed
   from these PVAs. We recommend that PVA be used to guide research
   programs, develop conservation strategies, and inform decision and
   policy making for both endangered and nonendangered species because it
   can significantly improve many aspects of natural resource policy and
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Serum concentrations of the steroid hormone corticosterone were
   monitored over a four-year period in two male and two female immature
   captive whitetip reef sharks, Triaenodon obesus. Corticosterone
   concentrations in the serum ranged from 69-999 pg/ml (319.8 +/- 31.9; n
   = 36) for males and 3-246 pg/ml (116.0 +/- 15.1; n = 32) for females.
   Males had significantly higher values than females (P < 0.001). No
   significant difference was detected between females; however, a
   significant difference was observed between the two males. No
   seasonality was observed in corticosterone levels. Corticosterone levels
   in elasmobranchs are only 10\% the levels of the principal
   glucocorticoid, 1 alpha-hydroxycorticosterone, but the assay is
   inexpensive and readily available, and, once individual ranges are
   established, the corticosterone concentrations have utility. Our data
   suggest that, after these baseline levels are established for individual
   sharks, long-term monitoring of serum corticosterone in captive
   populations may be utilized to monitor health or, conversely, stress.

Abstract = {{To assess the effect of deer exclusion on populations of Ixodes
   scapularis Say (formerly I. dammini Spielman, Clifford, Piesman and
   Corwin) in the northeastern United States, host-seeking ticks and ticks
   on white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus (Rafinesque), were monitored
   inside and outside a wooded, residential deer exclosure (approximate to
   3.5 ha) in Lyme, CT, in 1991 and 1992. Another deer exclosure was added
   in Lyme (approximate to 7.4 ha) during 1992. Additional sample sites at
   other residences served as secondary controls. A seven-wire, slanted,
   high-tensile electric deer fence was used at both areas. Larvae of I.
   scapularis were 81.5\% (1991) and 97.8\% (1992) less abundant within the
   exclosure than immediately outside the deer exclosures. Nymphs of I.
   scapularis were 47.4\% (1991) and 55.8\% (1992) less abundant within the
   deer fence. The effect on adult ticks was mixed. No difference in tick
   abundance was seen at the 3.5-ha site. However, larvae, nymphs, and
   adults were 100, 83.8, and 74.1\% less abundant, respectively, in plots
   at the 7.4-ha exclosure greater than or equal to 70 m from the deer
   fence and isolated from woodlands outside the fence by lawns, driveways,
   and buildings. The recovery of larvae and nymphs of I. scapularis from
   mice captured within the deer exclosures indicates that infestations of
   nymphs and adults are probably, at least in part, a result of the
   movement of these rodents. Based upon the number of nymphs per 100 m(2)
   infected with Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt \&
   Brenner, the causal agent of Lyme disease, there were 73 and 82\% fewer
   infected nymphs within the deer exclosures in 1992 in comparison with
   the number of infected ticks outside the fence and at the secondary
   control sites, respectively. The exclusion of deer in conjunction with
   other tick control strategies in large areas could substantially reduce
   populations of I. scapularis and the risk of acquiring Lyme disease.}},

   using DNA hybridization and isozyme electrophoretic techniques and were
   dissected to determine follicular maturation and parity. Of 1,178 An.
   quadrimaculatus mosquitoes identified to species, 4\% were species A and
   96\% were species C. Dissections of females of both species indicated
   that 98\% were nonblood fed and nongravid with ovariole development at
   Christophers' stage II. Overall parity rates were 0.19 and 0.51 for
   populations of species A and species C, respectively. The duration of
   the gonotrophic cycle for species C females was estimated to be 5 d
   based on the interval between peaks in the number of nulliparous females
   collected on days 1 and 6 and peaks in the number of parous females
   collected 5 d later. Significant trends were observed in the number of

Abstract = {{The tree limit of Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa (mountain birch) in the
   southern Swedish Scandes was monitored during 1972-1992. The study
   included various aspects of growth, vigour and reproduction of Betula.
   The main focus was on the character and mechanics of the tree
   limit/climate equilibrium system. The tree limit, which changed in
   response to a temperature rise early this century, remained constant in
   position and tree physiognomy did not change, although the past 50 yr or
   so have been colder. Indeed. growth and reproductive effort and capacity
   decreased in this period. Obviously, most resources in Betula were used
   to resist stress in the mature phase, resulting in delayed recession of
   trees. Unless drastic warming occurs, stem dieback is predicted for the
   near future. Even a minorclimatic disturbance would have an effect.
   because resources are gradually being depleted. Radial growth correlated
   most closely with the mean temperature in July. Particularly at the
   present-day tree limit, the variance in annual growth could be largely
   explained by climatic factors. The hypothesis is that long-term tree
   limit dynamics during the late Holocene is merely a matter of
   fluctuations in vegetative vigour and stature of old individuals. At the
   population level, response to climatic variability appears to be greatly
   delayed.}},

Abstract = {{The demography of Picea mariana (black spruce) and Pinus banksiana (jack
   pine) seedlings was monitored through five censuses over 13 months in
   four different seed bed types after fire of four severity levels in
   lichen woodland. Most seeds germinated just before early frost in late
   summer 1990 or immediately after snow thaw in early spring 199 1; the
   germination rate subsequently decreased. For both species, germination
   rate decreased along a gradient of fire severity. The proportion of
   Pinus seeds that produced a seedling surviving 13 months after sowing
   was 4.3 \% and 0.4 \% respectively in the intact lichen mat and in the
   mineral soil seed bed type. For Picea these values are 3.2 \% and 0.2 \%
   respectively. The low germination rate in a severely burned seed bed
   type appeared to be associated with the formation of a water-repellent
   crust at the soil surface following the fire. Seedlings were
   contagiously distributed and were more frequent in flat and hollow
   microsites, where there is probably more water available than on bumps
   or among pebbles. Properties of experimentally burned seed bed types may
   differ from those under natural fires where regeneration by seed
   generally occurs following dispersal. However, the high germination rate
   observed in the intact lichen mat suggests that scattered lichen
   woodland patches may respond to increased seed input by a higher
   frequency of seedling establishment.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive cycle of the bipolar sipunculan Golfingia margaritacea
   collected from Ushuaia, Argentina (54 degrees 49' S; 68 degrees 13' W)
   in 1986 and 1987 is reported. The population sampled showed a sex ratio
   of 1:1. Males, however, frequently outnumbered females. Measurements of
   coelomic oocytes delineated an annual reproductive cycle. Small oocytes
   were present in the coelom all year: a subpopulation began to increase
   size about the middle of spring and reached its maximum size in late
   summer. Spawns may occur from the end February to April. May is
   characterized by resorption of large oocytes. Monthy monitoring of the
   gonads revealed mitotic activity and a continuous release of gametocytes
   to the coelom. Parasites were detected in the gonads. Large coelomic
   oocytes were also present in the coelom during the same season in the
   Northern and Southern Hemispheres, but egg sizes were significantly
   larger in boreal populations.}},

Abstract = {{The cryogenic archival of biological specimens for retrospective
   analysis is of significant value for present and future research on
   population genetics, pathology, systematics, toxicology and
   environmental monitoring. This realization is emphasized by the
   increasing support of this activity by various government agencies,
   institutions and international groups. The international Arctic
   community is no exception. Canada has been conducting such activities in
   association with environmental monitoring programs for many years.
   Similar efforts appear to be underway in other polar nations. From the
   perspective of the United States Arctic, the Alaska Marine Mammal Tissue
   Archival Project (AMMTAP) was the earliest organized effort to develop
   an environmental specimen bank specifically designed for long-term
   archival of biological specimens under cryogenic conditions. The AMMTAP
   emphasizes use of standardized rigorous sampling and archival protocols,
   procedures that minimize contamination of samples during collection and
   maintaining a detailed record of sample history. The development of this
   specimen bank, recent activities of this project and other cryogenic
   specimen banks being developed in Alaska are described.}},

Abstract = {{Stress proteins have been shown to provide information on the biological
   impact of toxic chemicals to organisms and to predict adverse
   consequences of that exposure. In this study we have examined the
   accumulation to two major stress proteins, hsp60 and hsp70, in banked
   samples to determine if they accumulate at high levels in organisms
   exposed to contaminants in their environment. We found that relative to
   laboratory controls, stress proteins concentrations were elevated in
   mussels and fish tissue collected as part of the NOAA National Status
   and Trends Program. Sediment and water chemistry from the stations where
   these organisms were collected and data on contaminant body burdens of
   these same organisms indicated that they had been exposed to
   contaminants for long durations in their environment. This study
   suggests that stress protein accumulation may provide a method for
   quantifying adverse biological impacts of exposure to chemicals in the
   environment when examined in wild populations from contaminated sites,
   This aproach may also prove valuable in retrospective studies when used
   in banked specimens which have been collected as part of a large scale
   surveillance monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation to a stressed environment leads to organisms bearing DNA,
   encoding defense mechanisms. These mechanisms can be heavy metal
   resistance, catabolism of organic xenobiotics or stress reactions. Genes
   responsible for these mechanisms can be used for monitoring changing
   environments and therefore it can be important to store such bacteria in
   a bank. DNA-probing will be presented by the use of DNA fragments (of
   Alcaligenes eutrophus) coding for heavy metal resistance or xenobiotic
   degradation. Some strains do not grow on petri dishes and accordingly
   cannot be isolated from soils. In order to isolate plasmids from such
   strains, coding for heavy metal resistances or xenobiotic degradations,
   an exogenous plasmid isolation method was developed. In this method, the
   endogenous population is conjugated with Pseudomonas or Alcaligenes
   strains bearing a retrotransfer plasmid like RP4. In that way new
   plasmids from various sources including non-culturable strains could be
   obtained. With these methods, a large number of specimens adapted to
   stressed situations can be isolated or constructed (in the case of the
   exogenous plasmid isolation method). They form a source of interesting
   genetic material that can be used to restore polluted areas in natural
   areas, if necessary with the aid of genetic engineering (in vitro or in
   vivo techniques). Full knowledge of such bacteria and their resistance
   mechanisms or degradation pathways, can lead to new constructions able
   to attack recalcitrant mixtures of different organics and to resist
   heavy metals.}},

Abstract = {{Biological specimen banking methodology dictates that when a number of
   specimens of a particular type are available then the selected specimen
   be representative of the population in question. It is apparent though
   that this sorting process may present a formidable task which can be
   facilitated by employing tomographic transmission techniques using
   photons. Thus it is possible to discriminate between and discern
   abnormalities in specimens by obtaining the distribution of the photon
   linear attenuation coefficient, a function of atomic number and physical
   density, in sections through the specimen whilst maintaining its
   integrity. Fresh and freeze-dried specimens of porcine kidney were
   initially examined under differing temperature conditions using a single
   point photon transmission method, which was not successful due to the
   heterogeneity of the tissues. Whereas photon transmission tomography is
   shown to be well suited in testing for homogeneity, highlights the
   importance of scanning before cryogenic treatment and provides the
   possibility of monitoring tissue status over storage period by observing
   small changes in linear attenuation coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effects of bleached pulp-mill effluents on long-term
   population size and dynamics were investigated for the isopod Saduria
   entomon and the common amphipod Monoporeia affinis. Short-term
   experiments focused on fundamental mechanisms important to the
   equilibrium population densities and dynamics of the species were
   performed. The bleachery effluents caused behavioral changes in the
   species. The predator attack rate decreased with increasing exposure. If
   the results of the short-term experiments presented here are valid also
   for a chronic-exposure situation, then the simple population model
   suggests increased equilibrium densities of both the predator and the
   prey populations as the concentration of the effluents increases, until
   the lethal concentration is reached. Here, the lethal concentration
   means that mortality before maturation increases due to toxicity. The
   field densities of M. affinis were consistent with the predictions from
   the model both in time and space. Eutrophication may produce similar
   changes in the population levels, but the reduced individual mass of M.
   affinis over the last few decades implies that changes other than
   increased food are involved. The mere fact that also toxic substances
   may cause increasing populations of both predator and prey, makes it
   necessary to be observant when interpreting trends in monitoring
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass of available elk (Cervus elaphus) forages was monitored
   throughout a winter cycle in an age sequence of 1-200+ yr-old
   Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)
   forests in the Cascade Mountains. Additionally, fecal pellets of elk
   were collected from old-growth and 1-35 yr-old regenerating forests,
   from which we estimated plant species composition, dry matter
   digestibility and crude protein content of the diets. We tested
   hypotheses that plant species composition of feces and nutritional
   indices of diets did not differ between those endpoints of the forest
   successional continuum. Trends in available forages following clear-cut
   logging were related to stand-age, topographic landform, season and snow
   accumulation. Elk feces contained mainly deciduous shrubs and herbaceous
   forages during November, conifers and evergreen shrubs during midwinter
   when snow largely covered herbaceous forages, and herbaceous forages
   during early spring regrowth. Elk feces from 1-35 yr-old regenerating
   forests contained more herbaceous forage overall during winter than did
   feces from elk in old growth (P less than or equal to 0.02).
   Consequently, we observed greater indices of dietary crude protein and
   dry-matter digestibility during winter in a 1-35 yr-old than in an
   old-growth forest ecosystem (P less than or equal to 0.05). Implications
   for elk populations and forest management are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the change in the isotope composition of sulfur, carbon,
   and nitrogen in broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) tissues in response to
   a change in the isotope composition of their food. One of two batches of
   2.5-yr-old fish raised in the laboratory were given a new food source
   with different delta(34)S, delta(13)C, and delta(15)N, which were
   monitored in muscle and liver tissue for 1 yr. A model including change
   due to tissue accumulation (growth) and metabolic replacement was
   developed. For all three isotopes, most of the change could be
   attributed to growth. Metabolic replacement expressed as a turnover rate
   was only 0.1-0.2\%.d(-1) and was similar for the three isotopes.
   Although liver tissue was -4.4 and -4.1 parts per thousand,
   respectively, for delta(34)S and delta(13)C relative to muscle tissue,
   the response over time to the new food was the same as for muscle. We
   expect that the complete change in the isotope composition of fish
   tissue in response to a change in food could take years in slow-growing
   wild populations. The stable isotope composition would represent a
   long-term average of the food. In fast-growing fish the rate of change
   would directly reflect the growth rate.}},

Abstract = {{An increased probability of death is thought to be an inherent risk of
   dispersal. To examine this hypothesis, we monitored 381 radiomarked
   Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) over 6 yr to determine if their
   vulnerability to mortality increased during dispersal. Estimates of
   mortality were calculated for the two distinct phases of dispersal:
   transience, a period of extensive movement from one area to another, and
   colonization, the period when an animal attempts to become established
   in a new area. Among juveniles (nonresidents), approximately equal
   proportions of both sexes exhibited transience, and for similar lengths
   of time. The difference between juvenile male and female mortality
   estimates was not significant during either transience or colonization.
   From autumn to spring (natal dispersal), juvenile transient dispersers
   did not experience greater mortality than colonization dispersers. Among
   adults, transience was more common among females than males, yet no
   mortality was recorded among either sex of adult transient dispersers.
   Residents (adults) survived at a higher rate than juveniles in either
   transient or colonization dispersal. However, the cost (i.e., increased
   mortality) of transience was greater for juveniles than adults,
   suggesting comparisons between different phases of dispersal be made
   within similar age classes. It was concluded that Ruffed Grouse, both
   adults and juveniles, were not more vulnerable to mortality during
   transient dispersal than during colonization dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine the effects of grasshopper density
   and plant composition on grass growth and destruction by the mixed
   grass- and forb-feeding grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes (F.). Using
   a completely randomized design, 125 1-m2 cages were placed on plots on
   mixed-grass rangeland in western South Dakota and stocked with 0, 5, 10,
   15, or 20 fifth-instar M. sanguinipes. Grasshopper densities within the
   cages were monitored approximately weekly, and total grasshopper
   feeding-days were calculated for each cage for 68 d. Before adding
   grasshoppers, biomasses of grasses and forbs within the cages were
   estimated visually and after 68 d, final biomass of vegetation was
   determined. Results from analysis of variance with regression and
   multiple regression analysis indicated that grasshopper density and the
   initial biomass of western wheatgrass and shortgrasses within the cages
   significantly affected the final biomass and growth of western
   wheatgrass and the amount of grass removed by grasshoppers. However,
   significant reductions in grass biomass occurred only in cages stocked
   with 15 and 20 insects, equivalent to 845 and 1, 112 grasshopper
   feeding-days, respectively. Grasshopper density had no significant
   effect on biomass of shortgrasses and Japanese brome, although growth of
   these species was affected by initial biomass of grasses in the cages.}},

Abstract = {{Sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), was sampled on peanuts
   during 1991 and 1992 in Alachua County, FL, to determine parasitoid
   abundance and levels of parasitism. Common parasitoid species of B.
   tabaci in 1991 were Encarsia nigricephala Dozier, Encarsia pergandiella
   Howard, and Eretmocerus californicus Howard. E. nigricephala, E.
   pergandiella, and E. transvena (Timberlake) were the most abundant
   parasitoid species in 1992, whereas E. californicus appeared only
   rarely. E. nigricephala was the most common species in both years and
   accounted for 91\% of adult parasitoids reared from whitefly-infested
   foliage in 1991, and for 54 and 71\% of parasitoids reared from foliage
   at two sites in 1992. E. pergandiella, E. californicus, and E. transvena
   were more common during the late season, whereas E. nigricephala was
   most prevalent during the early season. Parasitism contributed
   significantly to-whitefly mortality and, in 1992, 90\% of all fourth
   instars were parasitized by 10 September at the second site and by 21
   September at the first site. Vertical distribution within plants of
   sweetpotato whitefly stages, unparasitized and parasitized, was assessed
   in 1992. Red eye nymphs (late fourth instar) were most common on leaves
   4, 5, and 6 (from the top of a lateral stem), and 91\% were located on
   the lower leaflet surface. Parasitized fourth instars were most
   prevalent on leaves 5, 6, and 7 and were found on the lower leaflet
   surface 79\% of the time. All life stages were equally distributed among
   the four leaflets of the compound leaf. These data indicate that
   monitoring for whitefly parasitism in peanuts could best be accomplished
   by examining both surfaces of a leaflet picked from the fifth leaf down
   from the terminal lateral stem leaf. The conservation of parasitoids to
   increase natural biological control of sweetpotato whitefly in peanuts
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Confidence in results from monitoring genetic end points in
   environmentally or occupationally exposed individuals can be improved
   with knowledge of the normal variability of changes in genetic end
   points in the general population. Confounding effects can be determined,
   and study interpretation can be improved by correlation of this
   variability with various lifestyle factors such as sex and age, smoking
   and drinking habits, viral infections, exposure to diagnostic X-rays,
   etc. Eight blood samples were taken from each of 24 male and 24 female
   volunteers over a period of 2 years. Questionnaires pertaining to
   lifestyle were completed at the time of each sampling. Whole blood was
   cultured and slides prepared for chromosome abberration (CA) or sister
   chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis. Separated mononuclear cells were
   cultured with a range of phytohemagglutinin concentrations, and the
   maximum level of mitogen-induced blastogenesis was determined by
   measurement of {[}H-3]thymidine uptake. There was a significant effect
   of both year and season of sampling for all three end points. Because
   there was no consistent pattern in 2 successive years, effects were
   thought to be independent of season. No significant effects in any of
   the three end points were found with respect to sex or age nor any of
   the other lifestyle factors, although SCE frequency and mitogen-induced
   blastogenesis were nearly always higher in females than in males. These
   results point to the need for concurrent sampling of controls with
   exposed populations.}},

Abstract = {{A multidisciplinary study on a general population exposed to vehicle
   exhaust was undertaken in Pisa in 1991. Environmental factors such as
   air pollution and those associated with lifestyle were studied.
   Meanwhile, biological and medical indicators of health condition were
   investigated. Chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges
   (SCEs), and micronuclei in lymphocytes were included for the assessment
   of the genotoxic risk. Because of the large number (3800) of subjects
   being investigated, standardization of protocols was compulsory. The
   results on data reproducibility are reported. To assess the reliability
   of the protocol on a large scale, the population of Porto Tolle, a
   village located in northeast Italy, was studied and compared to a subset
   of the Pisa population. Preliminary results showed that probable
   differences between the two populations and invididuals were present in
   terms of SCE frequencies. The study was potentially able to detect the
   effects of several factors such as age, smoking, genetics, and
   environment. The in vitro treatment of lymphocytes with diepoxybutane
   confirmed the presence of more responsive individuals and permitted us
   to investigate the genetic predisposition to genetic damage. The
   possible influence of environmental factors was studied by correlation
   analyses with external exposure to air pollutants as well as with
   several lifestyle factors.}},

Abstract = {{The development of the cytokinesis-block (CB) technique has made the
   human lymphocyte micronucleus assay (MN) a reliable and precise method
   for assessing chromosome damage. Recent `studies in our laboratory have
   confirmed that this method is a sensitive indicator of in vivo radiation
   exposure in patients undergoing fractionated partial-body radiotherapy
   and rodents exposed to uniform whole-body irradiation, thus supporting
   the application of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for
   biological dosimetry. To further define the use of this assay in
   biomonitoring, we have also undertaken extensive studies to determine
   the spontaneous level of MN in normal human populations and its
   relationship to various lifestyle factors. During the past year, we have
   also developed a new variation to the CBMN assay that enables the
   conversion of excision-repairable lesions to MN within one cell-cycle
   using cytosine arabinoside. With this method the slope of the in vitro
   dose-response curves was increased by a factor of 1.8 for X-rays, 10.3
   for ultraviolet (254 nm) radiation, and approximately 40-fold for
   methylnitrosourea. Consequently, the CBMN assay can now be used not only
   to measure whole chromosome loss or chromosome breaks but also excision
   repair events. The versatility and simplicity of the CBMN assay together
   with new developments in automation should enable its successful
   application in monitoring exposed populations as well as identifying
   mutagen-sensitive individuals within a population.}},

Abstract = {{Several metals such as arsenic, beryllium, chromium and nickel are
   carcinogenic to man when they occur in certain well-defined
   physicochemical forms. The carcinogenic potential of these metals is
   linked to their mutagenic properties. The determination of the metal or
   possibly of its metabolites in biological media and the cytogenetic
   examination of somatic cells are two methods that can currently be used
   to monitor exposure of populations at risk. Due to the use of
   inappropriate methodology, the value of the positive cytogenetic results
   published so far appears questionable. By contrast, the concentrations
   of metals in blood, urine, or other biological materials can be
   determined with accurate and precise methods. Although it does not
   permit a direct assessment of the carcinogenic risk, this approach is
   currently the most suitable for monitoring exposed populations.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic mutations have been implicated as critical early events in
   carcinogenesis. Point mutations, deletions, and translocation events
   have been shown to activate oncogenes or inactivate suppressor
   oncogenes. In human population monitoring, quantitative analysis of
   mutation events that affect gene function is limited to those genes
   whose cellular phenotypes can be identified by selection procedures and
   to those tissues (like blood) that are accessible for analysis. In an
   effort to determine the frequency and types of mutations that can be
   detected at the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt)
   gene, we have used the T-cell cloning assay and have developed a
   strategy to propagate mutants and screen for point mutations and
   breakage events. Early in the clonal expansion of mutants, 1-2 x 10(4)
   cells are prepared as a crude cell lysate, and a sample is analyzed
   using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those mutants that
   yield altered DNA fragments are then expanded for Southern blot
   hybridization, PCR, flanking probe isolation, and I)NA sequencing. To
   date we have found presumed point mutations, intragenic deletions, and
   deletions that extend outside of the hprt gene. By analyzing mutations
   in selectable, nonessential gene markers, it should be possible to
   understand mechanisms of both spontaneous and induced genetic damage. An
   association of these specific genetic events with human diseases and the
   evaluation of the ability of environmental chemicals to induce these
   specific types of mutations will lead to a rational basis for evaluating
   risks from various chemical exposures.}},

Abstract = {{Genotoxic agents induce chromosomal alterations, such as aberrations,
   micronuclei, and sister chromatid exchanges as well as mutations both in
   vivo and in vitro. Ionizing radiation and typical radiomimmetic agents
   such as bleomycin are very efficient inducers of chromosomal
   aberrations. The type of aberrations induced by these agents are
   cell-cycle dependent, i.e, chromosome type in pre-replication stages and
   chromatid type in post-replication stages of the cell cycle. Under
   optimal DNA repair conditions, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) appear to
   be the most important lesion responsible for the production of
   aberrations. In human lymphocytes, fast-repairing DSBs lead to
   exchange-type aberrations. The fact that the dose-response curves for
   induction of exchange aberrations induced by ionizing radiation are
   similar in vitro and in viro allows one to use the yield of induced
   aberrations to estimate absorbed radiation dose in the case of
   accidents. In this respect, frequencies of translocations detected by
   the chromosome painting technique appear to be more sensitive. Mutations
   do not express immediately after exposure and require an expression time
   before they can be detected. In humans, it is estimated that for the
   mutations induced in bone marrow, it takes about 2 months for them to
   express and to be detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Hence,
   frequency of mutations is of limited value for estimating radiation
   doses immediately after an accident. This holds true for chemical
   exposure as well. Most of the lesions induced by chemical mutagens (such
   as alkylating agents) are converted into aberrations only during the S
   phase of the cell cycle, and therefore an intervening DNA synthesis
   following exposure is necessary for the visualization of aberrations.
   These agents induce mainly the chromatid-type aberrations and are also
   very efficient in inducing sister chromatid exchanges. Chemical mutagens
   are more efficient in inducing gene mutations than ionizing radiations.
   In monitoring human populations, mutations in the hprt locus in
   peripheral lymphocytes and hemoglobin mutations as well as glycophorin
   mutations in erythrocytes can be studied. The hprt mutations and
   glycophorin mutations can arise from single base-pair changes to large
   deletions, whereas hemoglobin mutations arise from changes in a single
   codon.}},

Abstract = {{A small proportion of fishery products contaminated with appreciable
   amounts of potentially hazardous inorganic and organic contaminants from
   natural and environmental sources seem to pose the greatest potential
   for toxicity to consumers of fishery products in the United States.
   Health risks due to chemicals (e.g, modest changes in the overall risk
   of cancer, subtle deficits of neurological development in fetuses and
   children) are difficult to measure directly in people exposed to low
   levels. Immunocompetence may increase cancer risk. Inferences about the
   potential magnitude of these problems must be based on the levels of
   specific chemical present, observations of human populations and
   experimental animals exposed to relatively high doses, and theories
   about the likely mechanisms of action of specific intoxicants and the
   population distribution of sensitivity of human exposure. Lognormal
   distributions were found to provide good descriptions of the pattern of
   variation of contaminant concentrations among different species and
   geographic areas; this variability offers a solution for reduction of
   exposure through restricting harvest of aquatic animals from certain
   sites and by excluding certain species. Available information suggest
   that risks are not generally of high magnitude; nevertheless, their
   control will significantly improve public health. The following
   recommendations will help to reduce risk to humans: existing state and
   Federal regulations and environmental monitoring must be strengthened
   and enforced to improve the quality of the environment; a program of
   shared responsibility where Federal agencies develop a set of monitoring
   and inspection practices and state governments are responsible for site
   closures and issuing advisories should be established; research and
   public education by government agencies and health professionals should
   be expanded; mandatory labeling should be considered for specific
   contaminants; and a better system requiring international agreements
   should be developed to identify country of origin of imported fishery
   products and to harmonize product safety and quality.}},

Abstract = {{It is now possible to formulate diagnostic selenium concentrations in
   four distinct ecosystem-level components; water, food-chain, predatory
   fish (consuming fish or invertebrate prey), and aquatic birds.
   Waterborne selenium concentrations of 2 mu g/1 or greater (parts per
   billion; total recoverable basis in 0.45 mu filtered samples) should be
   considered hazardous to the health and long-term survival of fish and
   wildlife populations due to the high potential for food-chain
   bioaccumulation, dietary toxicity, and reproductive effects. In some
   cases, ultra-trace amounts of dissolved and particulate organic selenium
   may lead to bioaccumulation and toxicity even when total waterborne
   concentrations are less than 1 mu g/1.
   Food-chain organisms such as zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and
   certain forage fishes can accumulate up to 30 mu g/g dry weight selenium
   (some taxa up to 370 mu g/g) with no apparent effect on survival or
   reproduction. However, the dietary toxicity threshold for fish and
   wildlife is only 3 mu g/g; these food organisms would supply a toxic
   dose of selenium while being unaffected themselves. Because of this,
   food-chain organisms containing 3 mu g/g (parts per million) dry weight
   or more should be viewed as potentially lethal to fish and aquatic birds
   that consume them.
   Biological effects thresholds (dry weight) for the health and
   reproductive success of freshwater and anadromous fish are: whole body =
   4 mu g/g; skeletal muscle = 8 mu g/g; liver = 12 mu g/g; ovaries and
   eggs = 10 mu g/g. Effects thresholds for aquatic birds are: liver = 10
   mu g/g; eggs = 3 mu g/g. The most precise way to evaluate potential
   reproductive impacts to adult fish and aquatic bird populations is to
   measure selenium concentrations in gravid ovaries and eggs. This single
   measure integrates waterborne and dietary exposure, and allows an
   evaluation based on the most sensitive biological endpoint. Resource
   managers and aquatic biologists should obtain measurements of selenium
   concentrations present in water, food-chain organisms, and fish and
   wildlife tissues in order to formulate a comprehensive and conclusive
   assessment of the overall selenium status and health of aquatic
   ecosystems.}},

   (C-12-TMAC) on growth, reproduction, cellulolytic enzyme activity, and
   larval colonization of Asiatic clams (Corbicula fluminea) were
   investigated in experimental stream mesocosms. Clams from three
   different populations and of two known morphotypes were evaluated for
   growth in two 8-week experiments in fall 1989 and spring 1990. Growth
   was impaired at 185 mug TMAC per liter or greater for both seasons and
   was not morphotype dependent. Mortality, cellulolytic enzyme activity,
   and adult reproductive condition were not altered up to concentrations
   of 1153 mug/L. However, larval clam (pediveliger) colonization was
   affected at concentrations of 43 mug/L. It is not known at this time to
   what extent the effects on pediveligers would be manifested relative to
   recruitment to later life stages. These findings were compared to a
   published safety assessment for mono-alkyl quanternaries, of which TMAC
   is a member. The findings reported here do not substantially alter
   conclusions from previous studies; however, clams appear to be among the
   more sensitive taxa studied thus far.}},

Abstract = {{A workshop on `Biological interactions of natural and enhanced stocks of
   salmon in Alaska', was held in autumn 1991 at the Prince William Sound
   Science Center in Cordova, AL, USA. The subject and site were relevant
   as the impacts of hatchery operations on wild salmon stocks have
   recently become an international concern and Prince William Sound
   contains one of the largest salmon hatchery operations in the world.
   This workshop was designed to review the evidence, or lack thereof, that
   hatchery salmon are affecting the growth, survival, and natural genetic
   diversity of wild salmon in Alaska. International, national, and
   regional perspectives identified the important biological interactions
   between hatchery and wild salmon stocks, and characterized them in terms
   of genetics, carrying capacity, and harvest management. The workshop
   participants unanimously agreed on the importance of `maintaining
   genetic diversity within and between natural populations of salmon to
   sustain productivity of both wild and enhanced stocks'. An expansion of
   stock assessment and identification research and monitoring programs
   using new technologies (acoustics, optics, electronic mapping, marking,
   and gene sequencing) is the key to the acquisition of information needed
   to protect wild stocks from future over-exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging activity of the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus), a
   medium-sized ground-dwelling marsupial, was monitored in a multi-aged
   eucalypt forest site and a regrowth eucalypt forest site in southeastern
   Australia, The probability of occurrence, abundance and characteristics
   of diggings left in the soil profile by P. tridactylus while foraging
   for hypogeal (underground) fungal fruiting bodies, were recorded in
   relation to topographic location. We simultaneously obtained data on the
   distribution of animals from trapping records at both sites. In the
   multi-aged forest site, the probability of occurrence of diggings was
   higher in midslope-sheltered and gully locations than elsewhere in the
   catchment. In contrast, the abundance of diggings was similar across
   most topographic locations, though increasing in late autumn and winter,
   particularly in gully locations. This was in response to increased
   production of hypogeal fruiting bodies of some fungi. The depth of digs
   decreased concomitantly with this shift in foraging pattern. Thus, digs
   in gully locations were shallower than digs in ridge and midslope
   locations. At the regrowth forest site, the probability of occurrence
   and abundance of diggings of P. tridactylus was significantly higher in
   midslope-sheltered aspects than elsewhere in the catchment. Dig depth
   was shallower in gully sites than ridge or midslope sites, but did not
   change over time in any seasonal pattern. Differences in the probability
   of occurrence, abundance and characteristics of diggings of the two
   study populations partially reflect differences in the use of hypogeal
   fungi as a food resource. The distribution of trapped P. tridactylus at
   both study sites did not entirely reflect patterns of foraging,
   highlighting the limitations of this type of data in interpreting
   patterns of resource use by forest-dwelling mammals. The utilisation of
   different slope and aspect classes by P. tridactylus for foraging has
   important implications for the management of mycophagous mammals in
   multiple-use forests.}},

   19 Bq m-3 (0.52 pCi L-1) and 56 Bq m-3 (1.5 pCi L-1), respectively.
   Measurements of radon gas with different detectors and on different
   floors were compared to each other within residences. Ratios of
   screening to annual average results became more extreme as the measured
   concentrations increased; the mean ratio of basement canisters to
   year-long living area alpha-track detectors was 5.6 vs. 2.7 for houses
   that screened above and below 150 Bq m-3 (4 pCi L-1), respectively.
   Although the residence sample from which these data were drawn is not
   necessarily representative of either state or national housing stock,
   these observations, if verified, may have important implications for
   procedures and decision strategies designed to reduce individual and
   population exposures to radon.}},

Abstract = {{Living organisms are continuously exposed to reactive oxygen species as
   a consequence of biochemical reactions as well as external factors.
   Oxidative DNA damage has been implicated in aging, carcinogenesis and
   other degenerative diseases. The urinary excretion of the DNA repair
   product 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG) has been proposed as a
   noninvasive biomarker of oxidative DNA damage in humans in vivo. We have
   developed a three-dimensional HPLC analysis with electrochemical
   detection for the analysis of 8OHdG in urine and studied factors
   affecting the excretion of this biomarker in 83 healthy humans and in
   various laboratory animals, including dog, pig, and rat. Previously,
   other groups have used comparable HPLC methods or gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry with selective ion monitoring for
   measuring the excretion of 8OHdG in humans, rats, mice, and monkeys. In
   the 169 humans studied so far, the average 8OHdG excretion was 200-300
   pmol/kg per 24 h with a sevenfold range, and the coefficient of
   variation was 30-40\%. This excretion corresponds 140-200 oxidative
   modification of guanine bases per cell per day. Thirty-two smokers from
   our study population excreted 50\% (31-69\%; 95\% confidence interval)
   more 8OHdG than 53 nonsmokers. This indicates a SO\% increased rate of
   oxidative DNA damage from smoking, adding to the other well-known health
   hazards of smoking. The biochemical-physiological basis is unknown but
   may be related to smoke constituents including or generating reactive
   oxygen species and/or consuming antioxidants and/or the well-known
   enhancing effect of smoking on the metabolic rate. In our 83 healthy
   subjects the 8OHdG excretion correlated with body composition. Thus,
   lean and/or male subjects excreted more than obese and/or female
   subjects, possibly related to differences in metabolic rate. In
   accordance, the excretion of 8OHdG decreased after calorie restriction,
   which will cause a decline in the metabolic rate. Across the
   investigated species, humans, dogs, pigs, and rats, the excretion of
   8OHdG correlated with the specific metabolic rate, confirming data from
   other groups on humans, monkeys, rats, and mice. The excretion of 8OHdG
   decreased with age in rats in parallel with the decline in metabolic
   rate with advancing age. The excretion of 8OHdG reflects the formation
   and repair of only one out of approximately 20 described oxidative DNA
   modifications. So far, methods are not available for the determination
   of the corresponding repair products, except 8OHdG and thymidine glycol,
   in urine. Moreover, the importance in terms of mutagenicity,
   particularly regarding tumour supressor genes and oncogenes, is mainly
   documented for 8OHdG in DNA. In mammalian cells an excission repair
   enzyme complex for 8OHdG has been demonstrated, but whether the main
   product is 8OHdG or the base is yet unknown. In addition, 8OHdG may
   derive from DNA during turnover of mitochondria and cells as well as
   from oxidation in the deoxynucleotide and deoxynucleoside pools that
   provide building blocks for new DNA. Thus, the excretion of 8OHdG will
   reflect the general average risk of promutagenic oxidative adducts in
   DNA of all tissues and organs. We suggest that the individual variation
   in the apparent massive extent of oxidative DNA-damage in humans
   predicts the rate of aging and the risk of cancer as well as other
   degenerative diseases. The use of 8OHdG and similar urinary biomarker of
   oxidative DNA damage offers a valuable tool for testing such hypotheses
   in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Hormone assays have been developed and applied for monitoring
   reproductive function using self-collected urine samples in non-clinical
   populations of women. Early pregnancy loss, menstrual dysfunction,
   reduced fertility as well as the site of toxicity can now be assessed
   using daily early morning urine samples. The understanding of the
   specific limitations of individual assay systems is important, however,
   to make the best use of these systems. The use of multiple end-points
   and computer algorithms is suggested to avoid misclassification of
   adverse reproductive events. the frequency of detection, the arithmetic
   mean, nor the geometric mean value for urine mercury was found to be
   statistically different when persons living near the site were compared
   to persons from the more distant comparison area. The risk of mercury
   exposure associated with demographic variables, residence, occupation,
   hobbies, dietary habits, water supply, housing, and activity patterns
   was evaluated. In the second stage of the evaluation, the
   Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery (NCTB) is being used to assess
   individual functional deficits and nervous system disorders associated
   with exposure to mercury and other neurotoxic chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Salt blocks placed afield by Swedish hunters for wild ungulates also are
   used by mountain hares (Lepus timidus). However, little is known about
   the seasonal patterns of salt use by hares, a fundamental consideration
   regarding the potential benefit of this mineral appetite. Thus, we
   monitored the use of salt-block (NaCl) stations by mountain hares at the
   Grimso Wildlife Research Station, Riddarhyttan, Sweden from April 1988
   to June 1989. Use of the stations peaked between April and July,
   declined to a low in january, and then rose again to the April-July
   peak. We suggest that this use reflects an appetite for sodium (Na) that
   may result from the ingestion of plant secondary compounds, a seasonal
   excess of dietary potassium, and/or the nutrient demands of growth and
   reproduction. We also suggest that wildlife managers might benefit by
   learning why mountain hares have increased Na appetites at certain times
   of the year.}},

Abstract = {{The American lobster Homarus americanus and kelp Laminaria longicruris
   and L. saccharina are prominent and often intimately associated members
   of the subtidal community in the western North Atlantic Ocean. However,
   no one has identified the nature of this relationship or specifically
   investigated whether kelp beds are a superior habitat for lobsters. We
   conducted field studies in 1990 and 1991 at a coastal site centrally
   located along the Gulf of Maine, USA, to determine how lobsters use kelp
   beds as habitat. Identically sized and spaced plots of live and
   artificial (plastic) kelp were established and monitored for lobster
   population densities. Adjacent featureless sediment plots of identical
   size served as controls. Lobster population density and biomass were
   significantly higher in both real and artificial kelp treatments than in
   non-kelp control plots (p < 0.0001). The change in lobster density was
   apparent the day following placement of the experiment, so a secondary
   trophic effect such as attracting prey into treatments is unlikely to
   have occurred. Thus, kelp beds can affect local lobster population
   densities by providing shelter for lobsters, thereby concentrating
   individuals and increasing the local carrying capacity of potential
   lobster habitats. The effect of kelp beds on the local carrying capacity
   of lobster habitats was further explored by testing how lobsters respond
   to differing patch sizes. A graded size series of circular patches of
   artificial kelp was established, in which kelp blade density and total
   area were held constant for each treatment. Treatments were subdivided
   into four 1 M2, two 2 M2, or one 4 m2 patches. Experiments were surveyed
   for lobster population density and size structure to determine ff
   statistical differences existed among treatments. Lobster density was
   significantly greater in the smallest patches (p < 0.001). Moreover,
   lobsters typically occupied the edges of kelp beds, and their abundance
   within kelp patches corresponded to the patch's perimeter-to-area
   relationship. This suggests that edge effects' influence the local
   carrying capacity for lobsters by influencing the lobsters' choice of
   kelp beds as habitat.}},

   Adenostoma fasciculatum were investigated by experimentally burning at
   various intensities an old stand in southern California chaparral.
   Survival after fire, time of resprouting, herbivory, and survival after
   resprouting were monitored for more than 1 year after the fire. Greater
   fire intensity increased plant mortality and the size of plants that
   died as a consequence of the fire. Time from the fire until resprouting
   increased with increasing fire intensity and was related to plant size:
   the larger the plants the earlier they resprouted. Post-resprouting
   mortality also increased with fire intensity and was related to time of
   resprouting. Herbivory increased with fire intensity and the size of
   plants affected by it changed with the intensity of the fire. Fire
   intensity had profound direct and indirect effects on the population
   structure of Adenostoma fasciculatum. Plant size strongly determined the
   direct and indirect lethal effects of fire.}},

Abstract = {{Population dynamics and chlamydospore germination of Fusarium oxysporum
   f. sp. niveum, as well as colonization of watermelon roots by F.
   oxysporum, were monitored in relation to other microorganism populations
   and the incidence of Fusarium wilt in four soils representing different
   suppressive and conducive conditions. The soils consisted of an induced
   suppressive soil developed through monoculture to watermelon c cultivar
   Crimson Sweet, a nonsuppressive monoculture soil, a conducive fallow
   soil, and the suppressive soil rendered conducive by microwave
   treatment. An orange-colored mutant isolate of the pathogen, comparable
   to the wild-type in growth, pathogenicity, and root colonization, was
   used to differentiate the pathogen from indigenous populations of F.
   oxysporum in the field soils. Pathogen populations remained stable in
   the monoculture soils over a 6-mo period, but increased somewhat
   initially and remained at higher levels when added to conducive soils.
   Suppressiveness was not associated with inhibition of pathogen
   chlamydospore germination. There were no differences among the field
   soils in pathogen chlamydospore germination with glucose amendments of
   0-1.0 mg/g of soil. Populations of general bacteria, actinomycetes, and
   fluorescent pseudomonads, both in soil and on watermelon roots, tended
   to be greater in suppressive than in conducive field soils, whereas
   fungal populations were greatest in conductive field soil. Root
   colonization by introduced F. a. niveum, indigenous F. oxysporum, or
   other microorganism groups was not consistently related to
   suppressiveness, suggesting that specific antagonistic strains rather
   than general populations of microorganisms may be involved in
   suppression.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit of the domestic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) accumulate
   soluble sugars primarily in the form of the hexoses, glucose and
   fructose. In contrast, the predominant sugar in fruit of the wild tomato
   relative, L. chmielewskii, is sucrose. In the present study, the
   inheritance and linkage relations of sucrose accumulation were examined
   in interspecific L. esculentum x L. chmielewskii populations. In
   backcrosses to either the wild or domestic tomato, segregation for
   sucrose accumulation permitted qualitative analysis of the trait and
   indicated monogenic recessive control, although deviations from
   Mendelian inheritance were observed in some populations. This major
   gene, designated sucr, was mapped in F-2, F-3, and BC1F2 populations
   using a set of 95 informative RFLP and isozyme markers covering the
   tomato genome. A map location near the centromere of chromosome 3 was
   established, with tight linkage to the genomic clone TG102. Association
   of sucrose accumulation with yellow fruit, encoded by an allele of the r
   gene, permitted alignment with the classical map, thereby confirming the
   map location of sucr. A linkage map of the region surrounding sucr was
   obtained by monitoring recombination between flanking markers in the
   backcrosses to tomato. A cDNA clone of tomato fruit acid invertase,
   TIV1, was mapped to TG102 and sucr, with no recombination between the
   two RFLP markers observed in over 1700 meiotic products. Despite the
   tight linkage, TG102 and TIV1 hybridize to distinct restriction
   fragments, hence do not represent the same gene. The genetic data
   strongly suggest that sucr is an allele of the invertase gene and thus
   support previous biochemical studies that demonstrated low invertase
   activity in sucrose-accumulating fruit. L. hisutum, another
   low-invertase, sucrose-accumulating species, was hybridized with L.
   chmielewskii and the resulting F-1 plants accumulated sucrose,
   indicating that genetic control of soluble sugar composition is
   conserved in these two species.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports analyses of C pools and fluxes in land-water
   interface zones completed at the International Workshop: Terrestrial
   Biospheric Carbon Fluxes; Quantification of Sinks and Sources Of CO2
   (Bad Harzburg, Germany, March 1-5, 1993). The objective was to determine
   the role of these zones as global sinks of atmospheric CO2 as part of a
   larger effort to quantify global C sinks and sources in the past (ca.
   1850), the present, and the foreseeable future (ca. 2050). Assuming the
   world population doubles by the year 2050, storage of atmospheric C in
   reservoirs will also double, as will river loads of atmospheric C and
   nutrients. It is estimated that C sinks in temperate and boreal wetlands
   have decreased by about 50\%, from 0.2 to 0.1 Gt C yr-1, since 1850. The
   total decrease for wetlands may be considerably larger when tropical
   wetlands are taken into account, however, the area and C density of
   tropical wetlands are not well known at this time. Changes in
   cultivation practices and improved sampling of methaneogenesis have
   caused estimates of CH4 emissions from ricelands to drop substantially
   from 150 to 60 Tg yr-1. Even with doubled N and P loads, rivers are
   unlikely to fertilize more than about 20\% of the new primary production
   in the coastal ocean. The source of C for this new production may not be
   the atmosphere, however, because the coastal ocean exchanges large
   quantities of DIC with the open ocean. Until the C fluxes from air-sea
   exchange Of CO2 and DIC are better quantified, the C-sink potential of
   the coastal ocean will remain a major uncertainty in the global C cycle.
   Analysis of model simulations of oceanic C uptake reconfirmed that the
   open ocean appears to take up about 2.0 Gt C yr-1 from the atmosphere
   and that model estimates are in better accord now, +/-0.5 Gt C yr-1,
   than ever before. Land use management must consider the unique C sinks
   in coastal and alluvial wetlands in order to minimize the future
   negative impacts of agriculture and urban development. Long-term
   monitoring will be essential to prove the success, or failure, of
   management practices to sustain wetlands in the future. Relative to the
   other systems examined at the workshop, the C-sink capacity of the ocean
   (excluding estuaries) is not likely to be measurably affected in the
   foreseeable future by the management scenarios considered at the
   workshop.}},

Abstract = {{A microcosm experiment was conducted to assess the effects of salinity
   on coastal lagoon plankton assemblages. Five salinity levels were
   replicated four-fold in 380 1 fiberglass tanks. Salinity levels used
   were 0, 8.5, 17, 34 and 51 ppt, or 0, 25, 50, 100 and 150 percent
   seawater. These were achieved by mixing concentrated lagoon water and
   tapwater in different proportions. Tanks were inoculated with plankton
   collected from San Dieguito Lagoon (Del Mar, San Diego County,
   California) and other fresh and saline waterbodies in the area. Selected
   physical-chemical variables, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and other
   invertebrate populations were monitored on five sampling dates over a
   114 day period (13 August-5 December 1986).
   Total phytoplankton abundance increased with salinity, for salinities >
   17 ppt. Most taxa showed marked effects of salinity, though the pattern
   of the effects often varied greatly from date to date. Chlorophytes
   tended to be most abundant at 51 ppt. Pyrrhophytes were most abundant at
   0 or 51 ppt, and least abundant at 8.5 or 17 ppt. Cryptophytes increased
   with increasing salinity. Euglenophytes exhibited no salinity effect on
   any date. Bacillariophytes were most abundant at 8.5-34 ppt and least
   abundant at 51 ppt, with individual taxa showing maxima at 0-17 ppt
   (Navicula, Synedra), 8.5-34 ppt (Surirella, Amphora), and 34 ppt
   (Cylindrotheca).
   Total zooplankton abundance decreased with salinity, for salinities > 17
   ppt. The dominant taxa were protozoans, rotifers, cladocerans, and
   copepods, and all but the first group showed strong salinity effects.
   Protozoan abundance was unaffected by salinity. Rotifers were most
   abundant at 0 ppt (Keratella, Filinia) or 8.5 ppt (Brachionus). With few
   exceptions, cladocerans (Alona, Ceriodaphnia, Scapholeberis) were found
   only at 0 ppt. Abundance of calanoid copepods decreased with increasing
   salinity, with individual taxa showing maxima at 0 ppt (Diaptomus),
   8.5-17 ppt (Pseudodiaptomus, Eurytemora), and 34 ppt (Acartia).
   Cyclopoid copepods were most abundant at 17 ppt, with individual taxa
   showing maxima at 0 ppt (Eucyclops), 8.5 ppt (Halicyclops), and 17 ppt
   (Oithona). Harpacticoid copepods (Cletocamptus, Tachidius) were most
   abundant at 17-34 ppt. Ostracods and mosquito (Culex) larvae were most
   abundant at 8.5 ppt and absent at 34 and 51 ppt. Polychaetes generally
   were most abundant at 17-34 ppt, and water boatmen (Trichocorixa) at
   8.5-34 ppt. Various physical and chemical variables also showed
   significant variations with salinity. Tending to increase with salinity
   were temperature, ammonia and orthophosphate concentrations. Decreasing
   with salinity were pH, dissolved oxygen and silica concentrations. The
   causes and interrelationships of these salinity effects are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The flight periodicities of three species of Dalbulus leafhoppers were
   monitored in a controlled-environment chamber using Johnson-Taylor
   segregating suction traps. To assess their effect on flight activity,
   photoperiod and host plant age were experimentally manipulated to mimic
   conditions at different seasons in central Mexico. All three species
   flew during the crepuscular periods. Comparisons of the flight
   periodicity of the three species suggested that the maize specialists,
   D. maidis (DeLong \& Wolcott) and D. elimatus (Ball), are more likely
   than D. gelbus DeLong (a gamagrass {[}Tripsacum spp.] and maize feeder),
   to fly from mature maize plants at the end of summer. The second flight
   of the day of D. elimatus under simulated autumn conditions occurred in
   the middle of the afternoon when atmospheric instability is greatest and
   flight would result in emigration. Unexpectedly, the widespread pest
   species D. maidis displayed a lesser tendency to leave old maize in
   autumn than the high elevation endemic, D. elimatus. However, the flight
   behavior of D. maidis is consistent with winter (short photoperiod)
   migratory flight. Winter flights coinciding with the northerly wind `'el
   norte'' would carry leafhoppers from the Central Highlands of Mexico to
   lower elevations close to the Gulf Coast, where winter and spring rains
   are more common. A return to the central highlands on the rain bearing
   trade winds could account for the sudden appearance of D. maidis on
   seedling maize in June. These findings are consistent with previous
   observations suggesting a continuum of life style within the genus,
   ranging from sedentary species of relatively low fecundity and
   specializing on gamagrasses to D. maidis, a maize specialist.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred seventeen viscose rayon workers exposed to carbon disulfide,
   and 66 workers who were not exposed to any toxic agent in the working
   environment, underwent an endocrinological examination that included
   determination of thyroxine, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating
   hormone, prolactin, and testosterone in serum by radioimmunoassay
   methods. In the viscose rayon factory, the working conditions had not
   changed subsequent to 1932. Personal monitoring performed in 17 jobs
   showed that carbon disulfide exposures varied from 4 to 112 mg/m3. A
   carbon disulfide cumulative exposure index was calculated for each
   individual. Univariate analysis of the hormone levels versus exposure
   showed significantly lower levels of prolactin in the exposed versus
   nonexposed subjects (p = .01). After adjustment for age, alcohol,
   smoking, body mass index, and stress level, the carbon disulfide
   cumulative exposure index was not associated with any of the hormones.
   This discrepancy from previous studies may result from differences in
   exposure, in selection of the population, or in confounding biases.}},

Abstract = {{If climatic warming occurs, the first impacts on polar bears (Ursus
   maritimus) will be felt at the southern limits of their distribution,
   such as in James and Hudson bays, where the whole population is already
   forced to fast for approximately four months when the sea ice melts
   during the summer- Prolonging the ice-free period will increase
   nutritional stress on this population until they are no longer able to
   store enough fat to survive the ice-free period. Early signs of impact
   will include declining body condition, lowered reproductive rates,
   reduced survival of cubs, and an increase in polar bear-human
   interactions. Although most of these changes are currently detectable in
   the polar bears of western Hudson Bay, it cannot yet be determined if
   climatic change is involved. In the High Arctic, a decrease in ice cover
   may stimulate an initial increase in biological productivity. Eventually
   however, it is likely that seal populations will decline wherever the
   quality and availability of breeding habitat are reduced. Rain during
   the late winter may cause polar bear maternity dens to collapse, causing
   the death of occupants. Human-bear problems will increase as the open
   water period becomes longer and bears fasting and relying on their fat
   reserves become food stressed. If populations of polar bears decline,
   harvest quotas for native people will be reduced and eventually be
   eliminated. Tourism based on viewing polar bears in western Hudson Bay
   will likely disappear. Should the Arctic Ocean become seasonally ice
   free for a long enough period, it is likely polar bears would become
   extirpated from at least the southern part of their range. If climatic
   warming occurs, the polar bear is an ideal species through which to
   monitor the cumulative effects in arctic marine ecosystems because of
   its position at the top of the arctic marine food chain.}},

Abstract = {{Solitary bees are known to be important pollinators of seasonal dry
   forest plants in Costa Rica. Recent assessments of the genus Centris
   (family Anthophoridae) and other solitary bee taxa indicate that
   populations of these bees have declined by 85-90 percent in this forest
   over the past 20 yr. Deforestation, wildfires, and conversion of forest
   land to agriculture are the main reasons for the decline.
   From 1987 to 1991 we studied the preferred nesting habitats of seven
   Centris species that specialize in making their nests in preexisting
   holes in dead trees. Special wooden sampling units, with preexisting
   standardized holes, were systematically placed in several habitat types
   in the Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Guanacaste Province. Female
   bees encountered the holes as they searched for natural holes for
   nesting. Systematic monitoring of the units over five years, 1987 to
   1991, provided a quantitative measure of habitat preference and changes
   in bee frequency through time. There were sufficient data for
   statistical analysis of three of the seven species (Centris nitida, C.
   bicornuta and C. analis).
   The dosed oak forest was the predominantly preferred habitat for the
   three common Centris species, and this pattern remained constant through
   time. At least one species (C nitida) apparently had less strict habitat
   requirements as it was commonly found nesting in a wide variety of
   habitat types. Significant increases and decreases in frequencies for
   individual species through time were recorded; however, there was no
   significant change in overall bee numbers through time.
   Results of the analysis, together with a qualitative assessment of the
   rare Centris species, suggest that the dry forest is actually a mosaic
   of preferred nesting sites, with each species having specific
   preferences. This pattern is consistent with other Centris species that
   have been studied in Costa Rica. The preference for oak forests is
   significant and suggests that more of this type of habitat should be
   conserved for Centris refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the blowfly Lucilia sericata Meigen in sheep pastures
   were monitored for three years (1990-1992) using sticky targets. A
   simulation model, developed previously from detailed analyses of the
   effects of temperature on the component stages of the life-cycle of L.
   sericata, was used to predict the pattern of seasonal abundance expected
   during these years at the temperatures observed. After inclusion of the
   effects of temperature over each catching interval, the model was able
   to explain 67\%, 52\% and 49\% of the variance in catch in 1990, 1991
   and 1992, respectively. The model was validated by using regression
   coefficients and constants derived from data collected over previous
   years to predict the expected catch in the following year. Up to 50\% of
   the variance in catch was explained by this analysis. The results
   confirm value of the day-degree modelling approach for this blowfly
   species and suggest that such predictive models may play an important
   role in the development of strategic control for flystrike prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Density-dependent and environmental effects on population size are both
   too weak to be useful for short term fishery management (Smith, 1985).
   Year-to-year variation of recruitment rate may be of the same order of
   magnitude as measurement uncertainty and population changes may have to
   be sustained for 2 to 3 years to be detectable using the precision
   available from current techniques. As fishing rates accelerate, the
   dependence of the fishable biomass on recruitment is increased.
   Pre-recruit survival and growth may be more episodic than adult survival
   and fecundity (Smith and Moser, 1988). The episodic nature of
   recruitment combined with higher fishing rates may make more frequent
   biomass estimates necessary. When variable recruitment and high total
   instantaneous mortality rates (ITMR) reach a certain level, effective
   fisheries management will require development of recruitment prediction
   procedures in addition to virtual population and biomass monitoring.
   Annual biomass surveys may be redundant because many stocks contain
   several year classes. The costs of implementing recruitment prediction
   and systems to monitor biomass may be a significant fraction of the
   value of the added catch and this should be considered during management
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{A 4-year field cage study was conducted to determine what effects
   feeding of alfalfa plant bug, Adelphocoris lineolatus (Goeze), late in
   the season had on alfalfa seed yields. When zero, one, two, or four
   alfalfa plant bugs were placed in sleeve cages containing stems of
   alfalfa at the green pod stage of growth, there was a significant
   decrease in the number of pods per cage and per raceme, the number of
   healthy seeds, and the weight of seeds with two or four bugs per cage.
   Increasing the duration of infestation resulted in significant increases
   in the number of damaged seeds per cage. An insecticide field trial was
   conducted in north central Saskatchewan in 1988 to determine what
   effects the occurrence of plant bugs had on seed yields of alfalfa.
   Alfalfa plant bug, lygus bug (Lygus spp.), pea aphid {[}Acyrthosiphon
   pisum (Harris)], and beneficial arthropod populations were monitored
   from 23 June to 1 September 1988. Seed yields were significantly greater
   in plots that were treated with trichlorfon in June and in June and
   August than in plots that were treated in August alone. The implications
   of a large alfalfa plant bug population late in the season to alfalfa
   seed production in the area are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We studied (1984-86) the diet of rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca
   monocerata) nestlings at three colonies on the British Columbia coast
   (Lucy Islands, Pine Island, and Triangle Island), On the Lucy Islands,
   Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) dominated nestling food loads
   in all years. In 1985, 0+ sand lance dominated the nestling diet on all
   colonies. Concurrent measures of nestling growth rate, independent
   indexes of ocean production, and the proportion of sand lance in
   groundfish stomach samples were also highest in 1985. This suggests a
   linkage between ocean production, 0+ sand lance abundance, and events on
   seabird colonies over a broad geographic range. We emphasize the
   importance of sand lance to temperate seabirds and contrast British
   Columbia with areas where sand lance are commercially exploited.
   Rhinoceros auklet nestling diet, growth, and other data collected on
   colonies suggest that long-term monitoring on seabird colonies can
   contribute timely and inexpensive information on the recruitment of sand
   lance stocks in Canadian waters.}},

Abstract = {{Annual abundances of eggs, yolk-sac larvae (YSL), post-yolk-sac larvae
   (PYSL), and young-of-the-year (YOY) stages of Morone americana and
   Morone saxatilis are summarized from a 17-yr monitoring program in the
   Hudson River Estuary. Variability in temperature and freshwater flow in
   the Hudson River explained little of the interannual variation of early
   life stages of either species. Year class strength as indicated by the
   abundance of early life stages does not appear to be strongly influenced
   by environmental conditions. YSL were positively related to the
   abundance of eggs, but these relationships were weak, reflecting the
   high uncertainty in egg abundance estimates. There were positive
   relationships between the abundances of YSL and PYSL for both species.
   Our analysis implies that interannual variability in mortality is less
   important in determining recruitment to PYSL than the abundance of the
   prior life stages. There was no relationship, however, between the
   abundance estimates of PYSL and YOY. Differential mortality among years
   during the larval stage may result in juvenile recruitment being
   independent of larval abundance. A second possibility is that YOY are
   poorly sampled so that the monitoring programs currently provide
   inadequate estimates of the abundance of YOY.}},

Abstract = {{Female Peromyscus maniculatus rarely breed as young of the year in the
   Kananaskis Valley, southwestern Alberta. We monitored breeding by
   young-of-the-year females in unmanipulated sites from 1985 to 1991 and
   on manipulated sites (females removed, males removed, and food added)
   from 1989 to 1991. Breeding by young females was uncommon on all
   manipulated sites (16\% when food was added, 3 \% when females were
   removed, 0\% when males were removed). Females that matured as young of
   the year tended to have relatively high growth rates as nestlings. We
   conclude that individual quality is more important than social cues in
   regulating maturation by young females in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Urinary ratios of urea nitrogen:creatinine and cortisol:creatinine have
   been used as indices of the nutritional and physiological health of
   cervid populations. These ratios are used to monitor temporal trends in
   dietary protein and (or) energy deprivation, and changes in net
   catabolism of endogenous protein as body-fat reserves are depleted. Over
   a 2-year period, we compared urine chemistries of free-ranging and
   captive Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) to
   examine seasonal and locational differences. We also determined body
   composition of all deer using tritiated water. Elevated urea nitrogen
   and cortisol ratios of creatinine did not consistently reflect
   individual animal body condition as measured by declining fat content in
   our free-ranging animals. Instead these urinary ratios more likely
   reflect immediate dynamics between fat depletion, protein catabolism,
   and energy intake rather than long-term changes in body-fat reserves.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of accepting a false null hypothesis can be `'ute in
   conservation biology because endangered populations leave little margin
   for recovery from incorrect management decisions. The concept of
   statistical power provides a method of estimating the probability of
   accepting a false null hypothesis. We illustrate bow to calculate and
   interpret statistical power in a conservation context with two examples
   based on the vaquita (Phocoena sinus), an endangered porpoise, and the
   Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). The vaquita example
   shows bow to estimate power to detect negative trends in abundance.
   Power to detect a decline in abundance decreases as populations become
   smaller, and, for the vaquita, is unacceptably low witin the range of
   estimated population sizes. Consequently, detection of a decline should
   not be a necessary criterion for enacting conservation measures for rare
   species. For the Northern Spotted Owl, estimates of power allow a
   reinterpretation of results of a previous demographic analysis that
   concluded the population was stable. We find that even if the owl
   population bad been declining at 4\% per year, the probability of
   detecting the decline was at most 0.64, and probably closer to 0.13;
   bence, concluding that the population was stable was not justified
   Finally, we show bow calculations of power can be used to compare
   different methods of monitoring changes in the size of small
   populations. The optimal method of monitoring Northern Spotted Owl
   populations may depend both on the size of the study area in relation to
   the effort expended and on the density of animals. At low densities, a
   demographic approach can be more powerful than direct estimation of
   population size through surveys. At higher densities the demographic
   approach may be more Powerful for small populations, but surveys are
   more powerful for populations larger than about 100 owls. The tradeoff
   Point depends on density but apparently not on rate of decline Power
   decreases at low population sizes for both methods because of
   demographic stochasticity.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of endangered plants often requires the creation of new
   populations in order to decrease the risk of extinction Despite numerous
   attempts, no plant species have been fully recovered by creating new
   populations. Here we report on initial efforts to recover Amsinckia
   grandiflora Kleeb. ex Gray (Boraginaceae) by re-establishing the species
   in appropriate habitat within its historic range, with consideration
   given to genetic and demographic characteristics of the founding
   population. An experimental framework with demographic monitoring was
   used to follow the fates of nutlets (propagules)from two sources (one
   wild, one cultivated) and to evaluate the effects of habitat
   manipulations (fire. herbicide application, clipping) for reducing
   competition from introduced grasses. Founding nutlets from two sources
   bad different germination and genetic characteristics. Nutlets directly
   descended from a wild Population bad half the germination potential of
   nutlets from a cultivated population because of their greater age (about
   25 years in cold storage). Levels of genetic variability, as measured by
   allozyme electrophoresis at 18 loci, were low overall, but much more so
   in the cultivated population These data were used to maximize genetic
   variability among founding nutlets and to predict the frequency of
   alternative allele carriers in the new population. After sowing and plot
   treatment at the Lougher Ridge re-establishment site, the 3460 founding
   nutlets produced a large number of germinules (1774) during the
   1989-1990 growing season, and many (1101) survived to reproduce- From
   these plants, and estimated 35,800 nutlets were produced, indicating
   that the population bad a high potential for growth during subsequent
   years. Introduced grasses baa significant negative effects on
   survivorship to reproduction, plant size, and nutlet production in the
   new Amsinckia population Grass cover was effectively reduced by using
   fire or a grass-specific herbcide. Burning significantly decreased
   Amsinckia mortality rates early in the growing season and significantly
   increased survivorship to reproduction and maximum plant size- Herbicide
   treatment bad no effect on mortality rates or survivorship to
   reproduction, but it significantly increased plant size and, therefore,
   nutlet output per plant and per plot. The new population should be able
   to maintain itself within the existing grassland community, but growth
   and short-term viability would be assured by management practices that
   increased the availability of low-competition habitat patches for
   Amsinckia occupation}},

Abstract = {{Emphasis in environmental protection is shifting from primary attention
   to human health to a more balanced consideration of human and ecological
   health. This shift provides opportunities and challenges to the
   scientific community. For example, success depends on development of
   operational definitions of ecological health and programs to measure
   that health. Ecological health is inextricably tied to concepts such as
   biological diversity and biological integrity. Water chemistry and
   toxicity testing have dominated water-quality programs for decades.
   Success in protecting the ecological health of water resources depends
   on our ability to supplement those methods with ecologically robust
   approaches. Existing definitions and approaches for measuring the
   quality of water resources provide a template to guide development of
   procedures to assess ecological health. Critical components of
   successful monitoring programs should include evaluations relative to
   regional expectations, use multimetric indexes that reflect the
   multivariate nature of biological systems, and include index components
   (metrics) that evaluate conditions from individual, population,
   assemblage, and landscape perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Seedling size and survival in relation to summer drought were examined
   for Chrysothannus nauseosus growing under field and greenhouse
   conditions. In the field, summer survival rates were less than 2\%
   annually for the three years monitored. The effect of initial seedling
   height on subsequent survival was examined in both the field and
   greenhouse by grouping seedlings into live and dead categories on each
   census dale and comparing the initial heights for seedlings in these
   categories. For a majority of the census dates, the initial height of
   surviving seedlings was greater than the initial height of those that
   subsequently died (significant differences ranged from 1 to S mm),
   indicating that seedlings that were taller at the initiation of the
   drought period had a higher probability of survival. In the greenhouse,
   taller seedlings had greater shoot and root biomass and rooting depth.
   Seedlings that are larger (i.e., taller and have greater aboveground
   biomass) in late spring appear to have a higher probability of surviving
   the summer drought due to greater rooting depth and hence increased
   access to moisture in deeper soil layers. Seed availability and safe
   sites for germination were probably not limiting since large numbers of
   seedlings successfully germinated in a patchy pattern during the study
   period. Seedling size and probability of survival were not related to
   either seedling density or the distance to nearest seedling neighbor.
   Survival through summer drought appears to be the main limitation to
   seedling recruitment in this population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper quantifies the distribution and abundance of birds in the
   White Mountains, Inyo and Mono counties, California, during
   spring-summer 1989-91, to establish a baseline for monitoring the area's
   avifauna. Overall, 58 species were encountered in the single-leaf
   pinyon-Utah juniper (Pinus menophylla-Juniperus osteasperma) zone, and
   61 species in the bristlecone-limber pine (P. longaeoa-P. flexilis)
   zone. The bristlecone-limber pine zone had a significantly greater
   overall bird abundance relative to the pinyon-juniper. Both zones were
   characterized by few very abundant species, a few moderately abundant
   species, and numerous rare species. The Black-throated Gray Warbler
   (scientific names in tables), Gray Flycatcher, and Pinyon Tay were the
   most abundant species in the pinyon-juniper, whereas the Clark's
   Nutcracker, Mountain Chickadee, and Cassin's Finch were the most
   abundant species in the bristlecone-limber pine. There were few
   ecological or taxonomic replacements of species between zones, with the
   differences in distribution and abundance related primarily to the
   interaction between elevation and vegetation. Significant inter-year
   variation in abundance was found for about 20 species in each zone-more
   species showed declining rather than increasing trends. The Mountain
   Chickadee and White-breasted Nuthatch declined, whereas the Gray
   Flycatcher and Rock Wren increased across years in both zones. Reasons
   for declines in some species might be the severe drought that continued
   throughout this study.}},

   birds has generated increased interest in how to monitor and manage

   nests also allows collection of life history data (e.g., clutch size,
   numbers of broods, numbers of nesting attempts, nesting success), which
   provide important insight into vulnerability of species to decimation or
   pertubations.  Comparisons of nesting success and habitat use across the
   geographic range of a species can determine local habitat effects on
   population recruitment and historical constraints on habitat use and
   species distributions. In this paper, standardized methods and cues are

Abstract = {{Future areas of emphasis for research and scholarship in nematode
   ecology are indicated by pressing agricultural and environmental issues,
   by new directions in applied nematology, and by current technological
   advances. Studies in nematode ecology must extend beyond observation,
   counting, and simple statistical analysis. Experimentation and the
   testing of hypotheses are needed for understanding the biological
   mechanisms of ecological systems. Opportunities for fruitful
   experimentation in nematode ecology are emerging at the ecosystem,
   community, population, and individual levels. Nematode ecologists will
   best promote their field of study by closely monitoring and
   participating in the advances, initiatives, developments, and directions
   in the larger field of ecology.}},

Journal = {{MICROBIAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{In the course of an in situ bioremediation, different hydrologically
   controllable test plots were installed on the ground of a waste-oil
   contaminated site, and continuously injected with nutrient solution and
   the electron acceptors NO3-, O2, and H2O2. In a two-year period,
   groundwater samples obtained from different recovery wells within these
   field plots, in addition to subsoil samples, were monitored for several
   chemical and microbiological parameters. The removal of hydrocarbons
   observed in the water samples could not unambiguously be attributed to
   biodegradation, and was probably caused by groundwater treatment
   measures. However, chemical (gaschromatographic) and microbiological
   data from the subsoil samples indicated a biological degradation of
   pollutants. Analysis of the groundwater samples of the different test
   plots revealed only minor quantitative differences. With time, only a
   slight increase in bacterial numbers on different media, including
   hydrocarbon-agar, was observed. In general, chemical and microbiological
   analyses of groundwater samples cannot replace analyses of subsoil
   samples for a sufficient documentation of in situ remediation processes
   in subsoil. From the groundwater and subsoil samples, 3,446 pure
   cultures, obtained from R2A agar, were characterized morphologically and
   physiologically, and identified in order to study the culturable
   bacterial communities. Several qualitative differences in composition
   and diversity of the bacterial communities among the test plots were
   observed. More than 70 different species or taxonomic groups (most of
   them known as hydrocarbon degrading taxa) could be identified from the
   groundwater samples; these were mainly the Gram-negative genera
   Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Comamonas, Hydrogenophaga, Pseudomonas,
   Flavobacterium/Flexibacter/Cytophaga, and others. A high proportion of
   Gram-positive organisms (42.5\%), belonging to Bacillus and the various
   genera of coryneform and nocardioform organisms, were isolated from the
   subsoil samples.}},

Abstract = {{We examined physical condition, niche dimensions, and survival of New
   England cottontails (Sylvilagus transitionalis) that occupied 21 habitat
   patches of different sizes during winter. Rabbits on small patches
   (less-than-or-equal-to 2.5 ha) were predominantly males, and both sexes
   had lower body mass than individuals on large patches
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 5.0 ha). Niche indices (beta, where beta
   ranges from 0 to 1, and values approaching 1 indicate generalized
   resource use) of habitat use revealed that rabbits on small patches used
   a greater variety of microhabitats (based on understory stem density:
   beta(s) = 0.81, and proximity to cover: beta(c) = 0.79) than rabbits
   occupying large patches (beta(s) = 0.65, beta(c) = 0. 66). Rabbits on
   small patches also consumed low quality forage more often and fed at
   sites farther from escape cover than rabbits on large patches. There
   were no significant correlations between rabbit densities and niche
   dimensions. Niche expansion was not a result of competitive release or
   relaxation of predator pressure. Rabbits on small patches apparently
   modified their niche dimensions in response to resource limitations.
   This response included occupying sites with limited understory cover
   that apparently resulted in rabbits on small patches having a lower
   survival rate (0.35) than rabbits on large patches (0.69) during a
   10-week monitoring period. Skewed sex ratios and low survival rates
   among rabbits on small patches suggest that these habitats act as sinks
   to dispersing, juveniles from large (source) patches. As a result, local
   populations of New England cottontails may become vulnerable to
   extinction if large patches of habitat are not maintained.}},

Abstract = {{In 1939, E. B. Ford and R. A. Fisher commenced a long-term study of the
   moth, Panaxia dominula, at Cothill, Oxfordshire, England. Each year the
   population size was estimated and the frequency of the phenotypically
   recognisable medionigra allele monitored; the work has continued for 54
   years (54 breeding generations). Two artificial colonies were
   established, one in 1951, monitored irregularly until 1961, the other in
   1961 which was apparently not examined again until re-discovered by us
   in 1989.
   The P. dominula project and the many publications arising from it was
   specifically directed against Sewall Wright's view that random drift
   rather than natural selection determined allele frequencies in colonies
   such as Cothill where the population size varied from small (ca. 200) to
   moderately large (ca. 20,000). Ford and Fisher argued that natural
   selection was all-important and that drift could be discounted. The two
   views remained essentially polarised, although another Cothill worker,
   P. M. Sheppard, thought that both selection and drift could play their
   parts, particularly in a species where the population size varies so
   much from year to year. Whatever the truth of the matter, the P.
   dominula debate became one of the cornerstones for the study of
   ecological genetics in wild populations.
   Here we present evidence that the primary data on P. dominula may be
   faulty. We argue that field scoring of the medionigra phenotype was
   inconsistent and that environmental effects (temperature variations and
   movement between colonies) could alter the expression of phenotypes to
   an extent that errors in scoring might have been considerable. Our
   re-assessment does not settle the selection/drift issue. but suggests
   (in retrospect) that the moth was a poor choice upon which to base what
   at times was a heated argument.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of local extinction on the structure of a nematode community
   were examined by monitoring soil nematode populations in cores that were
   isolated from surrounding soil. The cores were intact blocks of
   deciduous forest soil and litter of three different sizes (75, 250, and
   920 cm3), maintained in a controlled-environment room, and sampled at
   2-month intervals for 16 months.
   The number of nematode types per sample declined over time, from an
   initial average of 16 to less than 5 per 100 individuals. Types that
   were morphologically specialized for feeding on resources that were
   abundant in the cores persisted. Extinctions were associated with
   deficiencies of resources and with low initial population size. Nematode
   types that survived were generally abundant, of low trophic position and
   small body size. Abundance distributions at the end of the experiment
   were more strongly dominated by one or a few types and had higher
   logarithmic variances despite lower richness. Similar findings have been
   reported from studies of much larger, above-ground animals. Local or
   regional extinction appears to be a common phenomenon in ecological
   systems, and may affect the richness and population structure of many
   natural communities.}},

   represented a mixture of stocks. In addition, significant shifts in age

Abstract = {{An allozyme electrophoretic analysis was carried out to evaluate the
   impact of stocking, and to assess the amount and distribution of genetic
   variation among brown trout populations in Northwestern Spain. For this
   purpose, populations from both non-flowing (lagoon and reservoir) and
   flowing (rivers) waters, stocked and unstocked, were studied in
   comparison with the hatchery populations used for stocking in this
   region. Genetic variation was found at 11 of 35 loci analyzed. Detection
   of suitable genetic markers, especially the LDH-5{*} diagnostic locus,
   permitted us to monitor the incidence of stocking practices. The low
   viability of stocked individuals within river populations was
   remarkable, in spite of the long period and great intensity of
   repopulation. Only four individuals out of 197 analyzed were of hatchery
   origin. The absence of introgression detected in river populations was
   accounted for by the extreme Wahlund effect observed at the diagnostic
   locus LDH-5{*}. On the contrary, in non-flowing waters a large
   introgression was revealed. The longer the period of stocking, the
   larger the introgression detected. Gene diversity analysis demonstrated
   an important genetic differentiation among natural populations (G(ST) =
   0.273), mostly within drainages (86\%), which shows an important
   microgeographical differentiation component. In sharp contrast the
   stocking hatcheries exhibited genetic homogeneity (G(ST) = 0.014).
   Genetic distance (D = 0.046) between indigenous and stocking groups
   apparently shows the presence of two divergent evolutionary lineages of
   brown trout. The levels of genetic variation were far greater in
   populations from non-flowing waters and stocking hatcheries as compared
   with river populations. This fact can be accounted for by the mixed
   origin of the former populations.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to assess the relationship between critical
   acidic conditions (pH, monomeric aluminum) in Maryland coastal plain
   streams and predicted mortality of early life stages of migratory fish
   such at yellow perch, white perch, blueback herring and alewife (focal
   species). Physicochemical parameters were evaluated in three
   acid-sensitive coastal plain streams in Maryland (Mattawoman Creek,
   Bacon Ridge Branch and Faulkner Branch) during rain events. Monitoring
   of focal species was conducted to determine whether potentially toxic
   acidification conditions from episodic acidic rain events occurred
   simultaneously with the presence of susceptible early life stages of the
   four migratory species. Critical acidic conditions for larval alewife
   were reported in Mattawoman Creek concurrently when these life stages
   were present in the creek. Critical acidic conditions were also reported
   for blueback herring and alewife in Bacon Ridge Branch; however,
   populations of these two species were not reported during our monitoring
   efforts. Populations of yellow perch and white perch were also very low
   or absent. The few yellow perch collected in Bacon Ridge Branch were
   likely a result of a stocking effort. Alewife, blueback herring and
   white perch ichthyoplankton were collected at Faulkner Branch; adults of
   all four focal species, except blueback herring, were also collected.
   Critical acidic conditions for blueback herring and alewife were
   reported for only two out of eight possible intervals in this stream.
   Episodic acidification events in Maryland coastal plain streams are
   stressful to alewife and blueback herring and are inhibiting recovery of
   these depleted stocks.}},

   Argyrotaenia velutinana (Walker), codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.),
   and spotted tentiform leafminer, Phyllonorycter blancardella (F.) to
   complete one generation. For the four insect species at all geographic
   locations (North Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan),
   the degree-day requirement for a generation is significantly smaller if
   the requirement is measured between the beginning of flight periods
   rather than between flight peaks. The degree-day requirement per
   seasonal generation significantly increases from spring to autumn for
   redbanded leafroller and spotted tentiform leafminer. Latitudinal
   effects on generation time for the tufted apple bud moth and redbanded
   leafroller show that the insects develop significantly faster and
   exhibit more synchronized flight periods with increasing latitude.
   Similar elevational effects are shown for tufted apple bud moth.
   Laboratory data do not give developmental parameter estimates that yield
   accurate phenology model predictions for three of the four species, and
   tufted apple bud moth developmental data from field cage rearings
   likewise give inaccurate parameter estimates for phenology model
   predictions. Model predictions of seasonal male flights are most
   accurate if model developmental parameters are estimated from monitoring
   field populations and these parameters are specific both spatially and

Abstract = {{Two species of turtles that occupy different ecological niches were
   compared for their usefulness as monitors of freshwater ecosystems where
   both low-level radioactive and nonradioactive contaminants are present.
   The pond slider (Trachemys scripta) and common snapping turtle (Chelydra
   serpentina) were analyzed for the presence of Sr-90, Cs-137, Co-60, and
   Hg, radionuclides and chemicals known to be present at the contaminated
   site, and single-strand breaks in liver DNA. The integrity of the DNA
   was examined by the alkaline unwinding assay, a technique that detects
   strand breaks as a biological marker of possible exposure to genotoxic
   agents. This measure of DNA damage was significantly increased in both
   species of turtles at the contaminated site compared with turtles of the
   same species at a reference site, and shows that contaminant-''posed
   populations were under more severe genotoxic stress than those at the
   reference site. The level of strand breaks observed at the contaminated
   site was high and in the range reported for other aquatic species
   exposed to deleterious concentrations of genotoxic agents such as
   chemicals and ionizing radiation. Statistically significantly higher
   concentrations of radionuclides and Hg were detected in the turtles from
   the contaminated area. Mercury concentrations were significantly higher
   in the more carnivorous snapping turtle compared with the slider;
   however, both species were effective monitors of the contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{1. An experiment was conducted to investigate potential impacts of food
   limitation and copepod predation on juvenile survival of Chaoborus
   punctipennis. We tested the hypotheses that: (i) juvenile survival of
   Chaoborus is influenced more by copepod predation than by starvation in
   a productive environment, and (ii) food limitation and predation
   interact to affect survival.
   2. Effects of food concentration (approximately 800, 1400 and 2300
   microzooplankton l-1) and predator density (0, 1 and 2 Mesocyclops edax
   l-1) on Chaoborus development and survival were evaluated using a 3 X 3
   factorial design. Jars containing lake water, the appropriate food and
   predator treatments, and two Chaoborus (< 12 h old) were rotated on a
   plankton wheel at 25-degrees-C. Survival and developmental stage were
   monitored daily until all individuals had either died or moulted to
   instar II.
   3. Predation by Mesocyclops was the major source of mortality, causing
   87.5\% of Chaoborus deaths over all treatments. Chaoborus mortality was
   significantly higher in treatments with Mesocyclops (67-100\%) than in
   predator-free treatment (0-13\%).
   4. Development time was significantly longer in the low-density food
   treatment than in the highest food treatment.
   5. No significant interaction between food limitation and predation was
   detected.
   6. These results suggest that predation by copepods may limit
   recruitment of juvenile Chaoborus in productive lakes.}},

   Barnacle nauplii were only a minor component of the zooplankton in whole
   water-column samples. Surface zooplankton abundance and biomass were
   higher at night than during the day in April and early May, prior to
   stabilization of the water column. The day versus night differences were
   primarily due to diurnal vertical migration by barnacle nauplii. Obvious
   diurnal differences in abundance and biomass of zooplankton at the sea
   surface were not detected after pycnocline formation. After pycnocline
   formation, copepod biomass in the upper 5 m was about 5 times higher
   than that of the integrated water column. This may explain why many
   young fishes congregate in the surface layer to feed.}},

   hesperus (Knight) as well as some beneficial predatory arthropods
   (Geocoris spp., Hemerobius spp., Chrysopa carnea (Stephens), Orius
   tristicolor (White), and spiders) in California strawberry fields. The
   Allen-vac (A-vac) sampler best approximated the whole-plant sample for
   L. hesperus and beneficials except spiders.  The beating tray provided
   the most consistent though lower estimates, but could provide a useful
   estimate of L. hesperus and beneficial arthropod abundance in an
   integrated pest management monitoring program.  The D-vac provided a
   slightly lower estimate of L. hesperus density than did the A-vac
   samples or beating-tray samples at a greater cost in sampling time.  For
   each regression of relative technique against the corresponding
   whole-plant estimate, the intercept was not significantly different from
   0. Taylor's power law was used to develop variance-mean models for each

Abstract = {{The effect of the rice stink bug, Oebalus pugnax (F.), on rough rice
   yield, head yield, and peck was investigated during 3 yr of experiments
   at Beaumont and Eagle Lake in the Texas Rice Belt.  Natural infestations
   of rice stink bugs were manipulated by varying planting date and
   applying control measures at selected rice grain maturation stages. 
   Data were subjected to linear, quadratic, and square root functions to
   obtain best-fit relationships.  Damage functions were characterized as
   nested or nonnested models to facilitate statistical test selection. 
   Nested models were statistically evaluated using the Schwarz criterion;
   nonnested models were subjected to the Cox test.  In the case of peck,
   damage that manifests itself as discolored spots on the rice kernel and
   thus reduces quality, we detected no statistical differences in
   explanatory power between a model including both nymphs and adult rice
   stink bugs and a model with only adult rice stink bugs.  Head yield (the
   percentage of whole grains after milling) was not affected by nymphal
   populations. Linear models best fit the damage relationships between
   adult rice stink bug densities at various grain maturation stages.  Peck
   varied across grain maturation stages, with a low of 0.019\% in milk to
   a high 0.033\% in hard dough per observed adult rice stink bug.  Data
   also suggest that a significant level of peck was unaccounted for by
   rice stink bug populations in the milk and later grain maturation
   stages, indicating monitoring of rice stink bug populations should begin
   during panicle exsertion.  Rough rice yield was not affected by nymphal
   or adult rice stink bug populations encountered in the experiments.}},

   in Riverside Co., California, over a period of 16-19 months. Temporal
   changes in numbers, reproduction, survival, and recruitment generally
   were similar and synchronous at the three study sites. Peaks in
   abundance were observed in the late spring-early summer and were
   preceded by periods of intense reproductive activity and high
   recruitment. Males in reproductive condition were found in all months of
   the study, whereas reproduction in females was more temporally
   restricted. Within adult and subadult age classes, males and females had
   similar survival rates, but adults displayed higher survival than
   subadults. Demographic processes in these species were closely

Abstract = {{The small bivalve Abra tenuis (Montagu) (Bivalvia: Semelidae) reaches
   the north-eastern edge of its range in the Wadden Sea near the
   Dutch/German border. In the Wadden Sea it is restricted to a narrow
   intertidal zone close to the high-water level. Data are reported from a
   population at Balgzand, in the south-westernmost part of the Wadden Sea,
   which has been monitored for two decades. This population showed a
   strongly fluctuating density and was seemingly absent for more than
   three years following three severe winters in succession. Over-winter
   survival in adults was greater during mild than cold winters, and close
   to zero during all winters that were colder than average. Recruitment
   was higher in warm than in cold summers. Growth was more rapid in warm
   than in cold spring-summer periods. In warm years growth rates were
   higher than in more southern locations, and values for maximum size and
   life span were relatively high.
   It is concluded that a single environmental factor, viz. temperature, is
   limiting the distribution of this species in the Wadden Sea.}},

Abstract = {{The movement of settlement-stage fishes from the pelagic environment of
   Exuma Sound, Bahamas, to shallow nursery areas on the Great Bahamas Bank
   was monitored for 75 d during winter 1990-1991. Fishes were collected
   with channel nets suspended in tidal passes between islands on the edge
   of Exuma Sound. Large-scale movement of fishes through the channels was
   restricted to flood tides that occurred during dark, moonless times of
   the night; very little movement was observed during the day, on ebb
   tides, or on moonlit nights. Many of the dominant taxa (e.g.
   leptocephali, Bothidae) recruited on dark nights throughout the study
   period, with peak onshore movement on nights when winds and currents had
   strong cross-shelf components of motion. Other taxa had very short,
   discrete recruitment pulses associated with specific environmental
   events; 86 \% of the total annual recruitment of Nassau grouper
   Epinephelus striatus occurred during a single 4 d storm that triggered
   extensive cross-shelf movement of water, while another 10 \% of the
   recruitment occurred during a second storm event. This reliance on
   unpredictable storm events to drive local recruitment suggests that
   short-term variability in wind-driven currents is a possible mechanism
   behind the significant interannual variability of many fish species.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgal absorption, biomass, and photophysiology were monitored in
   conjunction with the vertical attenuation of photosynthetically active
   radiation and spectral irradiance within the lower congelation ice and
   the platelet ice layer in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica in 1989. Between 89
   and 99 \% of the algal biomass was located within the 0.68 m thick
   platelet layer where standing crop, measured as chlorophyll a (chl a),
   increased from 280 to 1090 mg m-2 between October 26 and December 3.
   Algal biomass was highly stratified within the platelet ice layer. An
   increasing fraction, 38 to 90 \%, of integrated chl a was collected from
   the upper 0.125 m of the platelet layer, near the base of the
   congelation ice. Algal pigments accounted for > 95 \% of total light
   attenuation (ice + particles) within this layer. Sea ice microalgae
   exhibited photosynthetic properties consistent with extreme shade
   adaptation, including low mean pigment-specific absorption, a{*}BAR,
   {[}0.0074 to 0.0040 M2 (Mg chl a)-1] and low assimilation numbers
   {[}0.032 to 0.180 mg C (mg chl a)-1 h-1], both of which declined with
   depth. Vertical profiles revealed that low quantum yields for platelet
   ice assemblages were not a function of low temperature, as had
   previously been suspected, but vary with depth (and hence light level)
   from 0.033-0.051 mol C (Ein absorbed)-1 just beneath the base of the
   congelation ice to 0.086-0.113 mol C (Ein absorbed)-1 (approaching the
   theoretical maximum) at a depth of 0.31 m. Microalgae at the platelet
   ice surface exhibited photosynthetic characteristics which suggested
   that they were well adapted to the ambient light field while algae at
   depth appeared to retain excess photosynthetic capacity. The low a{*}BAR
   and compensation intensity exhibited by sea ice microalgae allowed
   accumulation of viable chl a in excess of the theoretical maximum of 0.4
   g M-2 (proposed for planktonic diatoms) to be supported by the available
   irradiance beneath sea ice. Fine-scale vertical profiles of
   photosynthetic parameters implied that values derived from course
   sampling of dense, stratified microalgal populations do not reliably
   reflect rates in situ.}},

   from cereal rust field surveys of the Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and
   Gulf Coast states in 1991. Fifty-five virulence/avirulence phenotypes
   were found among 647 single uredinial isolates on 14 host lines that are
   isogenic for leaf rust resistance. The frequencies of virulence to lines
   with Lr24 and Lr26 during 1991 were greater than in previous years.
   Regional race distribution patterns again suggested that the central
   United States is a single epidemiological unit distinct from the eastern
   United States. The distinctive racial composition of collections from
   the Southeast, Northeast, and Ohio Valley indicate that populations of
   P. r. tritici in those areas are discrete, suggesting epidemics
   originate from localized overwintering sources.}},

Abstract = {{Following turbine installation at the Kielder dam, the River North Tyne
   downstream is now characterized by large daily fluctuations in flow. A
   survey of trichopteran populations (Hydropsychidae, Rhyacophilidae and
   Polycentropodidae) was carried out to assess the impact of hydroelectric
   power generation (Phase III), and to compare the results with similar
   pre-impoundment (Phase I) and post-impoundment (Phase II) surveys.
   Benthic samples were collected quarterly upstream from the reservoir and
   at four stations downstream. Although the same three species
   (Hydropsyche siltalai, Hydropsyche pellucidula and Rhyacophila dorsalis)
   continue to dominate, there were some notable differences found between
   sampling sites. Species diversity was drastically reduced at the station
   nearest the dam, where 99\% of all larvae collected were R. dorsalis. At
   the next station 5 km downstream, where previously H. siltalai had been
   dominant, R. dorsalis now constitutes 65\% of collections. At the two
   stations farthest away from the dam the former prevalence of H. siltalai
   was re-established. It is suggested that the unstable, high flows at the
   reservoir outlet are likely to favour the predatory R. dorsalis rather
   than the filter feeding hydropsychids whose nets may be susceptible to
   damage. Upstream from Kielder Water, R. dorsalis was prominent in
   benthic samples, whereas numbers of H. siltalai were 10 times lower than
   in Phase II and 60 times lower than in Phase I. The extent to which such
   upstream changes may be related to altered patterns of community
   structure below the dam is not known, but these observations may warrant
   a more cautious approach when considering upstream areas as unaffected
   `reference sites'. Instar analyses suggested that winter-warm,
   summer-cool discharges were continuing to modify larval growth rates, as
   noted in Phase II. The results of this study are discussed in relation
   to present trends in water resource development in Britain, especially
   with regard to future needs in monitoring and research.}},

Abstract = {{Birds are highly mobile animals and we need to understand the factors
   and processes that determine numbers throughout their range and annual
   life cycle. Most avian studies have concentrated on birds using one
   locality at a particular time of year, but the numbers breeding or
   wintering in any one locality may be affected by the size of the greater
   population of which the local group forms a part, as well as by local
   conditions. Equilibrium theory provides a useful framework within which
   to analyse populations at this larger scale, although the meaning and
   usefulness of some of the concepts used for investigating local groups
   may change. New approaches are required in which mathematical models are
   used to integrate the results of studies on the behavioural and
   population ecology of local groups with those of large-scale monitoring
   programmes of the kind conducted by the BTO.}},

Abstract = {{The snout-vent length, tail length, weight, sex, activity, and
   orientation of a population of swamp snakes (Seminatrix pygaea) in
   north-central Florida were recorded from 1985 through 1990. A small
   temporary pond was monitored for 1343 days, using a drift fence -
   pitfall trap sampling regime. I captured 123 different snakes, plus 45
   recaptures. Juveniles comprised 89\% of the snakes at the pond. Females
   were generally longer and weighed more than males, although regression
   analysis showed no differences between the sexes in the relationship of
   length versus wet body mass. Males had longer tails than females. The
   sex ratio of snakes with a snout - vent length of more than 150 mm was
   1:1. Activity occurred throughout the year but peaked during summer.
   Hydroperiod and weather conditions did not appear to influence snake
   activity. During the latter years of the study, a regional drought that
   began in the mid-1980s became quite severe. However, drought had little
   direct effect on overland migration or body condition but caused snakes
   to leave or to shorten the amount of time they spent within the pond
   basin. Snakes immigrated and emigrated nonrandomly; orientation was
   directed to and from the nearest large water body. Certain temporary
   ponds may comprise developmental habitat for Seminatrix pygaea. The
   dynamic wet-dry climatic cycles in southeastern North America may lead
   to the formation of metapopulations in some aquatic snakes.}},

Abstract = {{During three breeding seasons, variation in the timing of estrus was
   monitored in wild red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in a jack pine
   forest in central Alberta. The proximate environmental factors that
   affect the timing of the onset of the breeding season in female
   squirrels, and variation in dates of estrus, were studied in parallel
   laboratory and field manipulations. Wild squirrels given ad libitum
   sunflower seed experienced a positive energy balance (weight gains)
   earlier in the season than did females on a normal diet. Seed addition
   advanced dates of estrus by an average of 3 weeks. Three potential cuing
   mechanisms for the seasonal onset of estrus were proposed and tested:
   onset of estrus is cued by (i) a simple response to net energy gain,
   (ii) an interaction between an endogenous circannual rhythm and net
   energy gain, or (iii) an interaction between annual changes in
   photoperiod and net energy gain in the absence of a circannual rhythm.
   Our results refute the first and third mechanisms, and support the idea
   that red squirrels have a circannual reproductive cycle entrained by
   photoperiod. Net energy gain interacts with this annual cycle to fine
   tune the time of ovulation. In laboratory experiments, female squirrels
   exposed to increasing day length experienced estrus within the normal
   season. Squirrels kept in constant short-day conditions (< 12 h), had
   delayed estrus cycles. Short-day conditions did not prevent the annual
   cycle of reproduction, indicating that an endogenous rhythm exists and
   is entrained by increasing day length. Comparisons with hibernating
   squirrels are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{During November 1988-December 1991 we livetrapped, radio-collared, and
   monitored the survival, reproduction, and movements of snowshoe hares
   (Lepus americanus) in highly fragmented habitat near the species'
   geographic limit in central Wisconsin. Our 7 study areas centered on 5-
   to 28-ha patches of prime habitat: dense stands of willow (Salix), alder
   (Alnus), and regenerating aspen (Populus) on poorly drained soils.
   Maximum hare densities averaged 1.6-0.8/ha, and were unrelated to patch
   size. Rapid declines to extinction occurred on 3 of the 5 smallest study
   areas; on another, where extinction seemed imminent, juvenile ingress
   restored the population. On the 2 largest areas (23 -28 ha of prime
   habitat) hare populations were stationary during the first 2 years, but
   declined by 50-70\% in the third as mean annual (September-August)
   survival of radio-collared hares fell from 0.27 (1988-1990) to 0.07
   (1990-1991). Annual survival on the 3 extinction sites averaged just
   0.015 compared with 0.179 elsewhere. Reproduction did not differ between
   small (5-7 ha) vs. larger (23-28 ha) patches nor between years.
   Estimated dispersal of adult and juvenile hares from the 5 small study
   areas was twice as high as from the 2 larger, viz. 16 vs. 35\% annually.
   Dispersers appeared to have markedly lower survival. Predation, chiefly
   by coyotes (Canis latrans), was the proximate cause of 96\% (117 of 122)
   of natural deaths among radio-collared hares, and was therefore the
   overwhelming determinant of survival and thus population trend. Results
   of this study suggest that probabilities of extinction in such
   fragmented habitat depend importantly on patch size and attendant hare
   numbers; i.e., fall populations of < 10 hares frequenting patches of
   prime habitat less-than-or-equal-to 5 ha are not likely to persist long
   without ingress.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of plant and animal species in tropical regions provide a
   variety of non-timber products that are used by billions of people all
   over the world. Conservation and long term utilization of these species
   require that they be harvested on a sustainable basis. However, the
   extent to which non-timber forest products are exploited without adverse
   effects on natural populations is not known. There is in fact
   considerable evidence for non-sustainable harvest of non-timber
   products. We outline methods that may be used to assess the impact of
   harvest on population processes of the species that are being harvested.
   We present sampling protocols for rapid assessment as well as long term
   monitoring of populations. We briefly consider the limitations of these
   methods and suggest that the monitoring protocols we outline should be
   part of an overall management plan designed to extract and utilize
   non-timber tropical forest products on a long term basis.}},

   reduced fertility has diminished the populations at risk, close medical

Abstract = {{Renewed interest in urban forestry has resulted in significant public
   investment in trees during the past few years, yet comprehensive urban
   forest monitoring programs are uncommon. Monitoring is an integral
   component of a program to sustain healthy community forests and long

   continued public involvement and support in community forestry. To
   overcome constraints to monitoring in urban environments, programs must
   be personally relevant, socially desirable, scientifically credible, and
   economically feasible. A three-tiered monitoring approach is presented.
   Canopy cover analysis documents net gains and losses in regional urban
   forest cover. Simplified detection monitoring uses trained volunteers to
   better understand tree population dynamics, while intensive monitoring
   characterizes urban forest functions and stressors. Implementation of an
   urban forest health initiative to develop, place, and evaluate

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring has been an ongoing activity on the U.S.
   Department of Energy's Hanford Site in southeastern Washington for
   almost 50 years. Objectives are to detect and assess potential impacts
   of Site operations on air, surface and ground waters, foodstuffs, fish,
   wildlife, soil and vegetation. Data from monitoring effects are used to
   calculate the overall radiological dose to humans working onsite or
   residing in nearby communities. In 1989, measured Hanford Site perimeter
   concentrations of airborne radionuclides were below applicable
   guidelines. Concentrations of radionuclides and nonradiological water
   quality in the Columbia River were in compliance with applicable
   standards. Foodstuffs irrigated with river water taken downstream of the
   Site showed radionuclide levels that were similar to those found in
   foodstuffs from control areas. Low levels of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in most
   onsite wildlife samples and concentrations of radionuclides in soils and
   vegetation from on- and offsite locations were typical of those
   attributable to worldwide fallout. The calculated dose potentially
   received by a maximally exposed individual (i.e., based on hypothetical,
   worst-case asumptions for all routes of exposure) in 1989 (0.05 mrem/yr)
   was similar to those calculated for 1985 through 1988.
   In addition to monitoring radioactivity in fish and wildlife, population
   numbers of key species are determined. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha) spawning in the Columbia River at Hanford has increased in
   recent years with a concomitant increase in winter roosting activity of
   bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). An elk (Cervus elaphus) herd,
   established by immigration in 1972, is also increasing. The Hanford Site
   currently serves as a refuge for Canada goose (Branta canadensis), great
   blue heron (Ardea herodias), and various plants and other animals, e.g.,
   mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and coyotes (Canis latrans).}},

   session on biodiversity and population monitoring) have stressed the
   importance of choosing appropriate species and locations for ecological

Abstract = {{Annual and seasonal variability of Georges Bank zooplankton biomass and
   dominant species abundance are described and related to variations in
   mean surface temperature and average depth distribution. Data were
   obtained from plankton samples collected bimonthly with a 0.333-mm mesh
   net throughout a ten-year period: 1977-86. Biomass was measured by
   displacement volume and the dominant species analyzed were the copepods
   Calanus finmarchicus, Pseudocalanus minutus, Centropages typicus,
   Centropages hamatus, and Metridia lucens.
   Biomass levels were high in 1977 through 1979, low in 1982 through 1984.
   Biomass and copepod abundance in the spring of 1977 were extraordinary.
   Measurements over the entire bank were two to three times above a
   ten-year median. Unlike the first five years of monitoring, the average
   seasonal biomass cycle was not coherent from 1982 through 1986.
   Departures from the average seasonal cycle occurred several times during
   the second half of the time series,
   Calanus finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus minutus abundance trends were
   nearly identical, suggesting that their populations may be affected by
   similar factors. Centropages hamatus abundance in the central shoal
   depth zone (<61 m) was related to surface temperature variability and
   its spring abundance estimates were indirectly proportional to the
   abundance of other dominant copepods. Centropages typicus counts in
   autumn 1985 were nearly double all other years, and Metridia lucens
   abundance surged in late spring 1979 but was low from 1983 through 1986.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested an hypothesis that plant stress was a causative factor
   of Panolis flammea outbreaks on lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in
   Scotland. Twenty-four, 1 ha plots of lodgepole pine were established on
   deep peat and ironpan sites. Six of these, three on each soil type, were
   left as controls. The remaining plots, also divided equally between the
   two soil types, were treated by: ( 1 ) fertiliser application; (2)
   thinning; (3) both.
   Populations of Panolis flammea were monitored from 198 3-1988 over six
   generations. Populations peaked in 1984 and then declined. Populations
   in deep peat areas tended to be higher than in ironpan areas, although
   differences were small. Treatment effects were also small although some
   differences were found. Fecundity of adults was greater on deep peat
   sites.
   Compared with control plots, early larval mortality (egg-third instar)
   was greatest on ironpan sites, but also significantly greater in thinned
   sites. Mid-larval mortality (III-IV instar) was greater on deep peat
   sites but only in some years. Late larval mortality (IV instar-pupae)
   was greater on deep peat sites, and significantly greater on fertilised
   trees, but significantly reduced in thinned sites. Over-wintering
   mortality was not affected by soil type alone, only by year, treatment
   and soil type interactions, which tended to be greatest in ironpan
   sites. Adult fecundity was the most important key factor on both soil
   types and in all treatments. Early larval mortality and late larval
   mortality were next most important factors on ironpan and deep peat
   sites respectively. The data provided no evidence to suggest that plant
   stress was a causative factor of Panolis flammea outbreaks on lodgepole
   pine in Scotland.}},

Abstract = {{Between 22 December and 25 December 1991, approximately 570 L of
   tritiated water was released from the K Reactor at the Savannah River
   Site. Analyses of river flow rates and measured tritium concentrations
   showed that approximately 210 TBq of tritium had been released from the
   reactor and was being transported down the Savannah River. Elevated
   tritium concentrations in the Savannah River were first detected on 26
   December 1991. The maximum measured tritium concentration at Highway 301
   (a major sampling point 37 km downstream of the Savannah River Site) was
   2.5 Bq mL-1. A hypothetical maximum individual located at Highway 301
   would have received a drinking water dose of approximately 0.35 muSv,
   less than 1\% of the Environmental Protection Agency's 40 muSv y-1
   drinking water standard. Concentrations at the intake canals to two
   water treatment facilities, approximately 160 km downstream, began to
   rise above normal on 28 December. The population dose to users of the
   downstream domestic water supplies and consumers of Savannah River biota
   was estimated to be 4.7 x 10(-3) person-Sv.}},

Abstract = {{Melaleuca, Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav.) S. T. Blake, populations in
   Florida are quite different in appearance from those observed in
   Australia, its native home. In Florida, where melaleuca is an introduced
   weed, the trees are generally taller, straighter, and form very dense
   populations. Sixty small (approx. 0.5 m) saplings were grown in pots
   beside our shadehouse in Townsville, Australia, in order to determine
   the role which Australia's herbivorous insects may play in limiting the
   growth of melaleuca. Half of these were treated every fortnight with
   systemic insecticides, which limit (but do not entirely prevent) insect
   damage to the saplings. Sapling growth was regularly monitored, as was
   insect presence and damage. After just 84 days, insecticide treated
   saplings were significantly taller than their unsprayed counterparts.
   The trunk girth and diameter of the sprayed saplings became
   significantly broader after 147 and 161 days respectively. Harvesting of
   20 of the saplings after six months, revealed that the insecticide
   treated saplings had greater stem biomass. During the initial six months
   of this study, the greatest damage to the untreated trees seems to have
   been the tip-wilting caused by Pomponatius typicus (Heteroptera:
   Coreidae) and the death of young leaves resulting from the feeding
   activities of Apion sp. B (Coleoptera: Apionidae). Our finding that
   ambient, low-levels of insect herbivores can rapidly suppress the growth
   of a large woody tree species is discussed with respect to the prospects
   for biological control of melaleuca.}},

Abstract = {{3,13-Dimethylheptadecane (3,13-dime-17Hy) is the major sex pheromone
   component of the western false hemlock looper (WFHL), Nepytia freemani
   Munroe. It was identified in extracts of female pheromone glands by
   coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and
   coupled GC-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Traps baited with 100 mug of
   3,13-dime-17Hy attracted large numbers of male WFHL. Of five additional
   candidate pheromone dimethylated hydrocarbons, only
   3,13-dimethylhexadecane attracted male WFHL. However, neither
   3,13-dime-16Hy nor the other four compounds enhanced attraction to
   3,13-dime-17Hy when tested in binary or ternary combination at
   respective ratios of 100:10, 100:1, or 100:1:1. Identification of the
   complete WFHL sex pheromone requires structural elucidation of all 12
   EAD-active components in gland extracts, determination of their
   chirality, and field testing of antennally active isomers in appropriate
   combinations and ratios. Stereoisomeric 3,13-dime-17Hy as trap bait may
   already be used to monitor WFHL populations.}},

Abstract = {{An emergence trap was designed to estimate absolute populations of adult
   corn rootworms (CRW), Diabrotica species. This trap incorporated
   elements from previous trap designs and also had several new and unique
   features. For example, a collecting device was developed to fit on the
   top of the pyramidal trap which facilitated the rapid monitoring of the
   beetles. A program providing the dimensions and angles for the screen
   pattern was written in Microsoft Basic(R) on an IBM computer. A
   construction adhesive was used to join the screen edges which proved to
   be very cost-effective and efficient. This program substantially reduced
   the time required to fit a new screen pattern compared to a trial and
   error approach. This trap was set rapidly in the field and easily
   monitored. Higher initial investment in construction was rapidly offset
   by lower monitoring cost.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat condition and hunter density may affect mortality rates of elk
   (Cervus elaphus), and therefore, the amount of recreational opportunity
   offered hunters. Thus, we radio-monitored 121 elk in the forested
   habitats of northcentral Idaho during 1986-91 to determine
   cause-specific mortality. Sixty-nine deaths recorded during this period
   included: 43 recovered rifle kills, 8 rifle wounding losses, 4 archery
   wounding losses, 2 recovered archery kills, 3 poaching kills, and 9
   other mortalities. Eighty-six percent of all elk deaths occurred during
   September and October and were associated with hunting. Annual survival
   rate of cow elk was 0.886 (SE = 0.094). Annual survival rate of bull elk
   was 0.600 (SE = 0.063). The probability of mortality during the hunting
   season was modelled with stepwise logistic regression from habitat and
   hunter density variables. The probability of mortality increased with
   road and hunter densities, and was lower in areas with highly broken or
   dissected terrain. Estimating cause-specific mortality is integral to
   population management and modelling. Mortality models, along with
   improved population estimation methods, and habitat monitoring
   techniques have the potential to predict the effects of habitat change
   on populations and how this may affect recreational opportunity.
   Mortality models also may help determine elk vulnerability during the
   bunting season.}},

Abstract = {{Effective management and modelling of the Playa Lakes Region (PLR)
   mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) population requires season and cause
   specific survival estimates. Habitat protection and management
   strategies will benefit from survival data as well. Thus, we monitored
   153 radio-marked female mallards during 3 winters 1986-87 to 1988-89, to
   examine factors affecting survival in the PLR. Mean survival rate during
   the 100-day period 21 November to 1 March was 0.777 +/- 0.04 (SE). We
   did not detect any age or annual differences in survival. Precipitation
   and habitat availability varied among years. Survival rates (S) were
   higher (P < 0.10) for individuals in good body condition (s = 0.888 +/-
   0.07) than those in poor condition (S = 0.661 +/- 0.09). The hunting
   season mortality rate was 0.018 +/- 0.05. Natural mortality, which
   included avian predation, during the 100-day study period was 0.210 (+/-
   0.07). Crippling mortality could not be determined because of rapid
   carcass loss. Early season body condition and extended sub-freezing
   weather appear to impact mallard survival most in the PLR. Habitat
   management should encompass the entire PLR to include secondary habitats
   used by mallards during freezing weather.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of nest success in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) typically focus
   on upland nesting habitats, but mallards also nest over water where
   their success rates may differ from upland habitats. We monitored
   overwater and upland mallard nests in southwestern Manitoba as part of
   other ongoing research projects during 1985-91. Nest success estimates
   (Mayfield method) were higher (P = 0.005) for overwater nests (43.9\%; n
   = 47) than for upland nests (12.2\%; n = 49). Overwater nests were more
   likely (P = 0.0002) to be parasitized (primarily by redheads; Aythya
   americana) than were upland nests (11\% vs. 0\% parasitized,
   respectively). Parasitized nests contained an average of 1.2 fewer (P =
   0.03) mallard eggs and had 23\% lower (P = 0.006) egg success than
   unparasitized nests, but these costs were not sufficient to offset the
   large advantage in nest success that was associated with overwater
   nesting. Our data indicated that a large fraction of the local mallard
   population was nesting successfully in a habitat that is not searched
   during traditional nesting studies. If this pattern is widespread in
   other mallard populations, then nesting studies should include
   measurements of the frequency and success of overwater nesting to obtain
   unbiased estimates of overall nest success.}},

Abstract = {{Northern pintails (Anas acuta) exist as a single circumpolar breeding
   population but display weak fidelity to given breeding sites. If
   fidelity to wintering areas is strong, management on wintering grounds
   may allow local winter populations to increase. Thus, I delineated
   reference areas for wintering areas based on recovery data for pintails
   banded during the winter (Dec-Feb) in the United States. Fidelity to
   these reference areas varied with the strongest fidelity observed for
   pintails banded in areas along coastal areas or near large bodies of
   water such as western Washington-northwestern Oregon, central
   California, northwestern Utah, the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast, and the
   Greater Chesapeake Bay Region. My analysis suggests that pintails
   occurred in distinct wintering populations and that wintering ground
   affiliations to certain areas appear to be more stable population units
   than breeding ground affiliations. Consequently, winter banding programs
   may be useful in monitoring survival of specific wintering populations
   of concern.}},

Abstract = {{Photographs and maps of the floating canopy of the giant kelp,
   Macrocystis pyrifera, provide an important data source to monitor
   nearshore water quality in southern California. Declines in water
   quality related to turbidity from coastal development, ocean discharges,
   and non-point source runoff have caused reductions in the areal extent
   of these kelp beds. Historically the kelp beds have been monitored by a
   variety of methods including small format infrared and color
   photography. New digital remote sensing instruments combined with
   geographical information system (GIS) databases offer an efficient
   method for collecting and analyzing data on changes in kelp bed size and
   location. SPOT satellite imagery has been found to provide adequate
   resolution for mapping the larger beds of giant kelp along the
   California coast. Beds smaller than 10 ha are not resolved well with
   SPOT imagery and need to be mapped with a resolution greater than the 20
   m pixel size provided by the SPOT multispectral imagery. Imagery from a
   prototype of the Positive Systems ADAR system, an airplane mounted
   multispectral video sensor, provided a spatial resolution of 2.3 m in 4
   spectral bands. ADAR imagery taken on 2 October 1991 of the San Onofre
   Kelp Bed in northern San Diego County showed 39\% more kelp than small
   format color infrared photography made during the same time period.}},

Abstract = {{The use of a Norwegian suction cutter to harvest populations of the
   brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jolis in southwestern Nova Scotia
   started in 1985. The impact of this type of mechanical harvest on the
   algal population structure was evaluated. Changes in the length and
   density of individual plants (clumps) within 0.25 M-2   quadrats, as
   well as the length of individual shoots within clumps were monitored
   before and after an experimental harvest. The mechanical harvest cut
   mainly the longer plants, thus changed the initial bimodal size
   structure of the population to unimodal. There was a 20 to 36\% plant
   mortality, reducing the plant density from 92.6 to 73.6 individuals m-2.
   Preharvest size distribution of the tagged shoots was skewed to the
   right and became more normal after the harvest. Tagged shoots in the
   harvested quadrats suffered a 42\% mortality as compared to 11\% of
   those in the control quadrats. An understanding of the impact of the
   mechanical harvesting on the harvested population is essential in the
   design of a management strategy. Sources of variation in the impact of
   mechanical harvest include the tide level at time of harvest, length of
   time the machine operated in one site, skill of the machine operator,
   and sharpness of the machine cutting blades.}},

Abstract = {{1. This paper provides a detailed review of the status and distribution
   of wintering seaducks (Scaup, Eider, Long-tailed Duck, Common Scoter,
   Velvet Scoter and Red-breasted Merganser) in Britain and Ireland. It is
   based on a literature review plus analysis of National Waterfowl Counts
   (NWC) and other data. A summary of current knowledge of wintering
   seaducks is provided together with information on threats to
   populations, conservation goals and research needs.
   2. Each species is examined in turn, with the emphasis on aspects of the
   population, habitat use, current distribution, trends and history.
   Important areas for individual species are highlighted.
   3. Overall, seaduck populations have changed considerably, those for
   Eider and Red-breasted Merganser having expanded greatly, whilst those
   for Scaup, Common and Velvet Scoter have declined during historical
   and/or recent times. The trend for Long-tailed Ducks is unclear. British
   population estimates are considered to be out of date and need to be
   revised. The premier areas for seaduck communities are highlighted, thus
   providing basic information for conservation action and future
   monitoring.
   4. Seaduck populations are threatened in a number of ways and the main
   factors are discussed. Oil pollution and the actions of commercial
   fisheries are the most important current threats. Conservation goals are
   suggested. These include an urgent need to develop appropriate domestic
   legislation to facilitate the protection of seaduck populations. Such
   legislation is currently almost entirely lacking.
   5. Some priorities for research, particularly for better population
   monitoring of seaducks in British and Irish waters, are provided. These
   include: alterations to the NWC scheme to allow the collation of
   opportunistic counts, made when the conditions are amenable for
   censusing seaducks; extension of the scheme into areas not currently
   surveyed (e.g. most parts of Ireland); and the establishment of
   intensive survey programmes to monitor seaducks in the key areas of
   Britain and Ireland. It is hoped that this paper will serve to stimulate
   interest and commitment from all who play a part in safeguarding our
   seaduck heritage.}},

Abstract = {{Western culture views insects and arachnids as pests and vermin that
   need to be controlled. They usually are not considered as something to
   be preserved. Accordingly, arthropods and other small organisms have not
   been taken seriously for conservation by policy makers and the
   conservation community at large. Having existed for more than 400
   million years and after surviving the Permian and Cretaceous mass
   extinctions, arthropods have been the most successful of all living
   things and along with other invertebrates constitute more than
   three-quarters of today's global biodiversity. Arthropods are major
   components of diverse ecosystems and are the major players in
   functioning of ecosystem processes. Nevertheless, arthropods, which are
   the least known and, along with other plants and animals, are
   relentlessly vanishing before our eyes. Thus, aside from anthropocentric
   perception and societal prejudice, arthropods certainly are not pests in
   an ecological or evolutionary context and have an inherent biological
   right to exist in an evolutionary context, with ecological and
   instrumental values. They must be preserved because of their inherent
   values but also because we need them for human survival. Thus,
   arthropods must become an important and necessary part of the
   conservation strategy at all levels of environmental organization, from
   populations and species to ecosystems and landscapes.
   Insect conservation aims at saving both endangered species and ecosystem
   processes with a multitude of approaches targeted at different scales.
   Conservation efforts for arthropods are daunting because all the odds
   are against them: whereas species diversity, population size and biomass
   are so large, taxonomy and faunal information are inadequate; whereas
   the need for taxonomic and biodiversity information increases greatly,
   the shortage of taxonomic expertise worsens.
   Basic issues of biodiversity and the loss of species are reviewed. The
   goals and strategies for insect conservation are discussed with a focus
   on inventory and monitoring. Taxonomic and environmental surveys are
   compared, and the needs for biodiversity monitoring are discussed as
   ecological monitoring process based on inventory data. This monitoring
   focuses on the health of nested biodiversity (composition, structure and
   process) and the state of species, differing from other contemporary
   monitoring efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Field sampling of populations of Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) on spring

   consisting of 47 estimates of mean aphid density (m; number of aphids

   more than T = 0, 1, 2...10,15, 20, and 25 aphids, respectively; defined
   as the tally threshold. The average sampling error level of the
   four-year data set was 0.196 (SE = 0.013). The empirical relationship
   between m and P(T) was developed for each T value using the parameters
   from the linear regression of ln(m) on ln{[}-ln(P(T))] and was
   satisfactory when T = 2, 3, 4, and 5 (as evidenced by the high r2 Values
   and relatively small mean squared errors from the regression analyses
   relating to the T values). In comparing the variances estimated from
   different formulae for predicting m from P(T), the variance of Binns \&
   Bostanian (1990b) was found to be more conservative and reliable in
   estimating the prediction variance. This variance was used in the
   development of binomial sampling plans for each T and in the
   determination of associated sampling precision denoted by the half-width
   of the confidence interval (d). Binomial sample sizes based on the T
   values of 2-5 were found to be associated with relatively small d values
   that may actually be reached and thus, are recommended for use in
   monitoring aphid populations for control decision making. However, at
   population densities below one aphid per tiller, binomial sampling was
   found to be feasible only when counts were based on empty tillers (T =
   0).}},

   region is as important as the more local, diffuse effects of declines in
   more than 60 endemic, nonanadromous species and subspecies. The
   simultaneous decline of numerous taxa in basins not afflicted with dams
   or diversions suggests that cumulative damage to aquatic habitats caused
   by logging grazing, urbanization, and other land uses plays a major role
   in icthyofaunal impoverishment.}},

Abstract = {{Communities subject to disturbance are apparently vulnerable to invasion
   in that they contain a large fraction of the introduced plant species
   persisting in any given area. Still, ecologists have a poor
   understanding of how details of the disturbance regime influence the
   success with which invaders spread through a community. In this paper,
   we report results from an experiment that investigates how the spatial
   distribution of bare ground influences the rate at which offspring of an
   introduced invader spread through a perennial ryegrass community.
   Artificially created gaps of three sizes were positioned along linear
   transects according to one of two spatial distributions. These six
   transects (one for each treatment combination) were positioned as spokes
   on a wheel and Senecio vulgaris was introduced into the center. After
   controlling for the total amount of gap area, we monitored the number
   ard position of Senecio vulgaris establishing for two subsequent
   generations. Our results showed that the rate of spread of Senecio
   vulgaris was sensitive to both the gap size and the gap distribution;
   plants moved a greater distance when the gaps were large and
   underdispersed. Simulation models confirm that this pattern follows from
   the way in which gaps sample from seed shadows. We derive an analytical
   expression to explain why the mean seed dispersal distance does not
   predict the spread of Senecio vulgaris adults, and show how rates of
   spatial spread will change under different spatial patterns of
   disturbance. Finally, a model of spatial point processes confirms that
   the distribution of gaps mediates the rate of weed spread in two
   dimensions as well.}},

Abstract = {{It has been increasingly accepted that park management policies in some
   countries should allow for limited access to park resources by the local
   people to meet their subsistence and cultural needs. However, too much
   access to the natural resources of a park may simply cause people to
   rely on the park resource and manage their own lands less intensively
   than hitherto.
   The issue of illegal livestock-grazing and fodder-cutting in Royal
   Chitwan National Park (RCNP) by local people is examined. The study area
   was comprised of 16 village units having an estimated population of
   148,404 people in 21,621 households. Despite the presence of a large
   number of armed guards, the data from interviews with farmers indicated
   that illegal livestock-grazing and fodder-cutting in RCNP were
   prevalent. In the spring season, grazing intensity on the Park was
   higher than in other seasons, whereas cutting of fodder was intense in
   both winter and spring seasons.
   The actual monitoring of 11 patches (totalling 365 ha) of grasslands or
   savanna for a calendar year inside the Park but near its boundary,
   indicated that illegal grazing averaged 4.1 head per ha (3.0 cattle, 0.9
   buffalo, and 0.2 sheep/goats). In addition, the livestock biomass was
   found to be increasing by 2.36\% per annum in Park-adjoining villages.
   There is some evidence that villagers adapt their livestock practices in
   response to the availability (illegal) of grazing in, and fodder-removal
   from, the Park.
   The pressures for illegal access to park resources will continue to grow
   and eventually will exceed the capacity of the resource to recover from
   harvest. The best approach. to resolve this illegal livestock grazing
   issue is neither strict protection nor widely-expanded access. The Park
   should consistently work to induce a gradual behavioural change, on the
   part of the farmers, to stall-feed livestock from fodder originating
   from their own farms and/or from community plantation.}},

Abstract = {{Rural tropical ecosystems are subject to many traditional land uses that
   employ the indigenous karst resources: rock, water, soil, vegetation,
   and wildlife. Individual resource pressures often arc subtle, but their
   combined impact can precipitate instability in the tropical karst
   environment, potentially resulting in disruption of food, water, and
   fuel supplies. The karst of central Belize was used intensively for some
   six centuries by Maya farmers. but between the 10th and 19th centuries
   AD most of it reverted to secondary forest. Commercial logging dominated
   the 19th and early 20th centuries, followed by the expansion of
   subsistence and commercial agriculture after 1945. In the 1980s resource
   use has accelerated as population and other pressures increase. Much
   karst remains forested, but there is increasing clearance for
   agricultural uses, particularly for citrus cultivation and small-scale
   mixed agriculture. Soil depletion has begun to occur, water resources
   are increasingly taxed, and some wildlife is threatened by habitat
   destruction and increased hunting. Lime production for the citrus
   industry has promoted quarrying, water extraction, and fuelwood use.
   Environmental stresses currently do not exceed the threshold of
   instability, but the rapidly developing rural economy warrants careful
   monitoring of resource pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Southwest metropolitan Mexico City (SWMMC) inhabitants have been exposed
   several hours per day for the last 6 years to photochemical smog, ozone
   being the most important oxidant pollutant. Subjects exposed to the
   SWMMC atmosphere develop several histopathological changes in their
   nasal mucosa: dysplasia is the most significant, affecting 78.72\% of
   adult individuals within 60 or more days of residence in SWMMC. This
   study was originally designed to explore whether chemical intervention
   could modify nasal dysplasia, as determined by nasal cytology, in a
   defined adult population. In a placebo-controlled, randomized,
   double-blind trial, 177 healthy male subjects were divided into 5 groups
   to whom 5000 IU of vitamin A, 100 IU of vitamin E, a combination of
   vitamins A and E (5000 IU + 100 IU), 16 mg of beta-carotene, or placebo
   were administered daily for 4 months. Sixteen clinical and cytological
   variables were monitored. No effect on dysplasia was seen at the end of
   the 4-month trial; however, an apparent reversibility as well as
   progression of the dysplastic nasal lesions and high correlation
   coefficients between dysplasia and nasal cytology of polymorphonuclear
   leukocytes (PMNs; 0.85), squamous metaplasia (SM; 0.50), and nasal
   mucosa atrophy (NMA; 0.41) were found. A mathematical theoretical nasal
   dysplasia (tD) predictor equation for SWMMC adult male inhabitants is
   proposed (tD = 0.85 DELTA PMNs + 0.50 DELTASM + 0.41 DELTANMA + 0.98),
   in which PMNs are the best single dysplasia predictor, and all variables
   are independent. We suggest that the nasal cytological changes in SWMMC
   inhabitants may constitute an adaptative response to environmental
   pollutants, and long-term follow-up of these subjects will be necessary
   to establish the possible outcomes of the nasal abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{The ground crickets Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius meet in a
   mosaic hybrid zone that stretches from New Jersey at least as far west
   as Illinois. Within mixed populations from the contact zone, `'pure''
   species individuals predominate. To determine whether hybrids are less
   viable than pure-species individuals, and to assess whether the high
   proportion of pure-species individuals in mixed populations results from
   hybrid inviability, we performed a cohort analysis. In this study, five
   mixed populations from the hybrid zone were each sampled three to five
   times from the fall of 1986 to the spring of 1988. Individuals were
   assigned to one of three categories based on their genotypes: A. socius
   (individuals harboring only alleles unique to A. socius), hybrid
   (individuals with alleles unique to both species), and A. fasciatus
   (individuals harboring only alleles unique to A. fasciatus). This
   sampling and measurement scheme permitted monitoring of the proportion
   of hybrid individuals in a population over time. The results were fairly
   consistent. The relative survival of A. socius was greater than the
   relative survival of members of the other two groups in four of the five
   populations. The relative viability of A. fasciatus was greater than
   that of hybrids in one population, approximately equal to that of
   hybrids in two populations, and less than that of hybrids in two
   populations. These results not only shed light on an important component
   of fitness, viability from hatching to adulthood, but they demonstrate
   that loss of hybrid individuals during the course of the field season
   will not explain deviations from random mating expectations present in
   mixed populations in late summer. The deviations must be due to
   assortative mating or to a reproductive barrier operating prior to egg
   hatch.}},

Abstract = {{Directive 91/67/EEC lays down the health conditions which from 1 January
   1993, apply to the marketing of aquaculture animals and products within
   and between the 12 Member States of the EEC, and to their importation
   from countries outside the Community. The main purpose is to facilitate
   intra-Community trade whilst providing a common framework within which
   steps may be taken to prevent the introduction or spread of economically
   serious diseases of fish and shellfish. Although primarily aimed at
   preventing disease spread between aquaculture operations, these measures
   also take into account the risk of transfer of disease from farmed to
   wild populations and vice versa. For salmonids, there will be protection
   for areas ('approved zones') of the Community which are free of the List
   II diseases. Supplies of live fish (whether of farm or wild origin) of
   species susceptible to these diseases to any farm or natural waters in
   these zones will be allowed only from sources in other approved zones
   elsewhere in the Community. Dead fish (of the susceptible species)
   originating from non-approved zones must be eviscerated before marketing
   in an approved zone. Additional health guarantees may apply for areas
   free from one or more of certain other (List III) diseases, e.g.
   infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN), bacterial kidney disease (BKD),
   furunculosis and Gyrodactylosis, or when a voluntary or compulsory
   control programme is in force for the disease(s) in question.
   Importation of live salmonids and their ova or salmonid carcasses from
   outside the Community will be restricted to those originating from
   countries (or parts of those countries) with a satisfactory fish health
   situation (particularly the absence of List I diseases) and which have
   import controls and disease monitoring/control measures for both farmed
   and wild fish, to a standard at least equivalent to that operating
   within the Community.}},

   either cumbersome to deploy or ineffective. However, attempts to develop
   improved traps are often hindered by the lack of an understanding of the
   underlying fly response. The linking of currently available analytical
   techniques with an understanding of A. suspensa behavior should allow
   optimization of attractants and traps, and provide powerful methods for

Abstract = {{In an attempt to identify whether the phenological development of an
   associated plant species would be well synchronized with spruce seed
   maturation, we examined the floral development of fireweed (Epilobium
   angustifolium L.) by dividing the inflorescence into six distinct parts.
   Weekly harvest on five different sites across the distribution of white
   spruce in Quebec, showed a good correlation between the timing of white
   spruce seed maturation and the beginning of capsule bursting at the base
   of fireweed inflorescence (r(s) = 0.92). These two stages of development
   correspond to 1276 +/- 112 degree-days or 1943 +/- 155 thermal units,
   the latter yielding the greatest precision. Development of each section
   of the inflorescence progressed successively from the base to the top
   with a delay ranging between 3 and 7 days. Therefore, it appears
   possible to forecast the optimal moment for collection of white spruce
   cones 2 weeks in advance by monitoring the acropetal progression of the
   floral axis of fireweed. The influence of other factors, such as
   drainage class, light environment, and intra-population variations are
   also discussed.}},

Title = {{EFFECTS OF DIET QUALITY ON THE NESTLING GROWTH OF A WILD INSECTIVOROUS
   PASSERINE, THE HOUSE MARTIN DELICHON-URBICA}},

Abstract = {{1. Many studies have shown environmental effects on the growth and body
   size of wild birds. Most investigations have centred on the role of
   nestling nutrition in these effects. However, few of these studies have
   investigated the role of diet quality in the growth of wild birds. In
   this study I investigate the effect of altering nestling diet quality on
   the growth of a hirundine, the house martin.
   2. The quality of the diet fed to nestling house martins was reduced
   through direct fat feeding. This resulted in a diet of insects and fat
   which satisfied energy demand while providing fewer nutrients than the
   usual wholly insect diet. Effects of fat feeding were monitored by
   recording parental visits, by collecting the faecal Output of broods and
   by measuring nestling growth.
   3. In both years, fat feeding reduced parental feeding visits and
   fat-free faecal output of broods while producing little alteration in
   estimated total energy intake. Fat-free faecal mass was positively
   correlated with an index of parental visits. Mass of fat fed explained
   most variation in the faecal output of broods.
   4. Field metabolic rate of 14-day-old nestlings (mean 54.8 kJ day-1),
   measured using the doubly labelled water technique, did not differ
   between treatments after correction for nestling diet artefacts.
   5. Fat-fed broods grew more slowly and were smaller at day 20 and at
   fledging than control broods even though fledging later. Wing growth was
   correlated with fat-free faecal output.
   6. It was concluded that diet quality differences resulting from fat
   feeding had caused the difference in nestling growth and that this
   diet-quality effect may be present in wild bird populations. However, in
   house martins natural variation in food abundance is probably more
   important in determining growth than variation in diet quality.}},

Abstract = {{We studied habitat selection patterns of Merriam's Turkey (Meleagris

   vegetation of habitats using criteria from the Rocky Mountain Region,
   U.S. Forest Service, for determining effects of forest management and
   monitoring of wildlife populations. Most habitat units were 4-32 ha and
   corresponded to third-order habitats as described by Johnson (1980).
   Wens with poults selected large meadows and rarely selected dense
   ponderosa pine habitats. Younger poults used meadows more frequently
   than did older poults. Implementation of the Black Hills National Forest
   Land and Resource Management Plan in ponderosa pine habitats will not
   negatively impact hens with poults. Grazing by livestock reduces
   herbaceous biomass necessary far invertebrate food items of poults and
   cover for poults. Habitat selection patterns of hens with poults should
   be evaluated by age categories of poults.}},

   Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.; and zucchini, Cucurbita pepo L. Seven-
   and 14-d-old adult offspring from each host plant were tested for
   susceptibility to acephate in 12 laboratory bioassays (2 colonies x 3
   hosts x 2 ages). Twenty-fold differences in LC50 between colonies with
   environmental conditions held constant indicated a genetically based
   resistance to acephate. Host plant had no significant effect on
   susceptibility to acephate. The LC50 of 7-d-old adults was consistently
   double the LC50 of 14-d-old adults. Although the 95\% confidence limits
   of LC50 overlapped in pairwise comparisons between age classes, ANOVA
   showed that the effect of age was highly significant. Results suggest
   that differences in LC50 that are greater-than-or-equal-to 10-fold are
   likely to be based partly, if not entirely, on genetic differences. Much
   additional work is needed to determine if the results are broadly
   applicable. We encourage use of ANOVA in future studies because it
   provides simple and direct tests for overall effects of genotype,
   environment, and genotype X environment interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Six field populations of redbanded leafroller, Argyrotaenia velutinana
   (Walker), were monitored for azinphosmethyl resistance during the autumn
   flight of 1989 with a sticky-card bioassay in which adult males captured
   in sex pheromone traps were exposed to a concentration series of
   azinphosmethyl. This field bioassay, plus a laboratory bioassay
   performed on neonates from two of the field populations, did not detect
   azinphosmethyl resistance in this tortricid, even in an orchard where
   heavy reliance on azinphosmethyl led to azinphosmethyl resistance in
   another tortricid, Platynota idaeusalis (Walker). The sticky-card
   bioassay with a diagnostic concentration of 90 mug (AI) azinphosmethyl/g
   adhesive killed the expected 95\% of the adults captured in a population
   during the summer and autumn flights, but killed only 89\% of the males
   captured during the spring flight of 1990. We attributed the greater
   tolerance to azinphosmethyl in adult males from the spring flight to the
   significantly larger weight (1.4-fold) of males captured in the spring
   than in the autumn. A new diagnostic concentration of 120 mug (AI)
   azinphosmethyl/g adhesive, adjusted for adults captured during the
   spring flight, was evaluated during the 1991 spring flight and better
   approximated a concentration that killed 95\% of the susceptible adult
   males during this flight. Our report describes baseline data on the
   susceptibility of redbanded leafroller to azinphosmethyl.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of field infestations of the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis
   noxia (Mordvilko), on yield of winter wheat in the Texas Rolling Plains
   were studied. In 1988-1989, colonies established from three different
   population isolates were released into small plots in the fall and
   spring. In 1990-1991, aphids of one colony were released at three
   different infestation levels on each of four release dates during the
   growing season. Populations of all aphid species and number of mummified
   aphids were monitored in 1990-1991. In 1988-1989, the aphid colonies did
   not differ in population numbers or in their effect on yield, but fall
   infestations resulted in higher Russian wheat aphid numbers and greater
   yield loss than spring infestations. In 1990-1991, an early fall release
   was the only release that developed high numbers and caused yield loss.
   Infestations resulting from releases made in early and late winter and
   early spring did not affect yield. Initial infestation levels of 330,
   660, and 1,000 aphids per 12-m2 plot had no significant effect on
   Russian wheat aphid numbers during the late part of the season or on
   yield. Higher numbers of Russian wheat aphids developed in 1990-1991
   than in 1988-1989, but peaks in the populations during both years
   occurred in mid- to late April. Densities of greenbug, Schizaphis
   graminum (Rondani), and bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.),
   and aphid mummies were positively correlated with high Russian wheat
   aphid densities. Unsuitable wind direction and lack of alternate host
   plants are discussed as possible factors that limit Russian wheat aphid
   infestations in the Texas Rolling Plains.}},

Abstract = {{Between March and December 1990, a survey of Pine Marten Martes martes
   L. on the Balearic Islands of Minorca and Majorca was carried out. Pine
   Marten were found distributed over 55\% of Minorca and occupied Aleppo
   Pine and Holm Oak forests, mediterranean shrublands and riparian/cliff
   habitats. In Majorca, Pine Marten were found on 48\% of the island and
   three broad physiographic areas, the Sierra de Tramuntana, Sierra de
   Levant and the Massif de Randa. Droppings were collected along four
   designated routes during five bimonthly intervals in Minorca to describe
   the Pine Marten's differential use of habitat types.  The upland/open
   pine forest had the highest use index while the Holm Oak forest had the
   lowest. The number of Pine Marten faeces collected was greatest during
   the months of July-August.  The Balearic Island Pine Marten populations
   were once on the verge of extinction; however, protection during the
   last 20 years has enabled the species to recover throughout most of the
   forested habitats on both islands. Resource managers must carefully
   monitor the Pine Marten populations to provide the species and its
   habitat with adequate protection and management in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal and vertical changes of picocyanobacteria (PC) were monitored
   daily together with environmental variables during the summer
   stratification period (16 July to 9 August 1992) in the Seto Inland Sea,
   Japan. Coupled with wind mixing, N- and P-nutrients were introduced to
   the surface layer twice (19 July and after 30 July). A PC bloom (5 x
   10(4) ml-1) occurred following the first mixing event, and a rapid
   decrease of this bloom seemed to be attributed to high abundance (> 2 x
   10(3) ml-1) of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN). In contrast, the
   second mixing event did not induce a PC bloom in spite of the high
   nutrient concentration, low abundance of HNAN (< 2 x 10(3) ml-1) and
   optimum temperature for growth. Field experiments on PC growth in the <
   2 mum seawater fraction conducted during the second mixing period
   revealed that addition of metal buffer solution enhanced the PC growth
   rates significantly. Although trace metal concentrations were not
   monitored and clean techniques were not used in the experiments, we
   infer that growth stimulation was not an experimental artifact, but due
   to Fe-deficiency of the PC populations. This is based on results
   obtained in our previous studies concerning trace metal contamination.
   It is suggested that Fe-deficiency was responsible for the lack of a PC
   bloom during the second mixing period.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that herbivore selectivity, rather than plant response to
   defoliation, is the overriding factor in determining community level
   responses to grazing was tested in a Texas grassland. We monitored
   defoliation intensity and subsequent regrowth and reproduction of
   herbaceous dominants Schizachyrium scoparium and Paspallum plicatulum at
   the individual tiller, population, and community levels of organization.
   While long-term observations indicate that Schizachyrium declines and
   Paspalum increases in response to herbivory, individual Schizachyrium
   tillers exhibited little response to any level of defoliation and were
   able to fully compensate for lost tissue on a seasonal basis.
   Conversely, individual Paspalum tillers responded negatively to
   defoliation throughout much of the growing season, failing to compensate
   for leaf tissue lost to herbivory.
   Defoliation intensity was not proportional to availability.
   Schizachyrium tillers were selected by herbivores in preference to
   Paspalum tillers regardless of season or stocking rate. Herbivore
   pressure required to achieve uniform defoliation exceeded levels
   required to allow grazers to maintain adequate forage intake.
   New tiller recruitment per unit area declined over a four-year period as
   herbivore pressure increased for Schizachyrium. In contrast, Paspalum
   tiller recruitment remained constant over four years. The inability of
   heavily defoliated Schizachyrium plants to recruit new tillers and the
   ability of Paspalum to avoid defoliation and recruit new tillers into
   the population was manifest in measurements of standing crop over the
   same period. The ratio of Schizachyrium to Paspalum standing crop
   increased from 1.3 to 1.5 in protected areas. In treatments with extreme
   herbivore pressure the ratio declined from 1.3 to 0.6. Our hypothesis
   that herbivore selectivity, rather than defoliation tolerance, is the
   overriding factor mitigating species change was supported by these
   experiments and we suggest that predictions of competitive interactions
   within a lifeform based on individual and species responses to
   disturbances such as defoliation may not provide a valid assessment of
   community level responses.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms controlling seed dormancy maintenance and release are not
   understood. To characterize the molecular events accompanying dormancy
   release, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to monitor changes
   in soluble proteins and in vitro translation products of embryonic mRNA
   populations during imbibition of dormant and nondormant (after-ripened)
   Avena fatua L. caryopses. No differences were observed between in vitro
   translation products of mRNA extracted from dry dormant and nondormant
   embryos. However, the expression patterns of several imbibition- and
   germination-associated mRNAs were temporally modulated during the first
   24 h of imbibition. Two dormancy-associated mRNAs, represented by
   polypeptides D1 and D2, were differentially overexpressed in dormant
   embryos after 3 h of imbibition. mRNA levels for D1 and D2 were about 8-
   and 3-fold higher, respectively, in dormant embryos than in nondormant
   embryos after 3 h of imbibition. Overexpression of D1 continued through
   12 h of imbibition, while expression of both mRNAs fell to low and
   equivalent amounts in dormant and nondormant embryos after 24 h. Similar
   dormancy-associated changes in two soluble proteins were observed during
   imbibition. The results demonstrate that steady-state levels of specific
   mRNAs and proteins change during early imbibition of dormant and
   nondormant A. fatua embryos and indicate that these changes may be
   associated with differential gene expression responsible for the
   maintenance of dormancy.}},

Abstract = {{Florunner peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) planted in irrigated and
   nonirrigated plots were either not treated or sprayed four times with
   diniconazole at 0.07, 0.14, and 0.28 kg/ha in 1988 and 1989. Paired
   plots in the nontreated and 0.28 kg/ ha treatments were infested with a
   conidial suspension of Aspergillus parasiticus (a member of the
   Aspergillus flavus group) or left noninfested. Populations of the A.
   flavus group and the Aspergillus niger group were monitored in the soil
   throughout the season as well as in the shells and seed after harvest.
   Treatment with diniconazole had no effect (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05)
   on populations of the A. flavus group in the soil or shells, and reduced
   populations in seed only in 1989. The fungicide had no effect on soil
   populations of A. niger but reduced isolation frequencies from both
   shells and seed. Artificial infestation with A. parasiticus
   significantly increased A. flavus-group soil populations but had little
   effect on isolation frequencies from shells or seeds. Irrigation
   decreased isolation frequencies of both A.flavus and A. niger from
   shells and seed, but irrigation had no effect on soil populations of A.
   niger and variable effects on A. flavus populations. Aflatoxins were
   detected only in 1989. Mean concentrations were 11 and 2 ppb for the
   nonirrigated and irrigated plots, respectively. Neither fungicide
   treatment nor infestation with A. parasiticus affected aflatoxin levels.
   Aflatoxin concentrations were significantly correlated (P = 0.0001) with
   A. flavus-group populations in both shells and seed (r = 0.70 and 0.57,
   respectively).}},

Abstract = {{The effects of P application and stocking rate on the persistence of
   Siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum cv. Siratro) and shrubby stylo
   (Stylosanthes scabra cv. Fitzroy) were monitored in 2 experiments over 9
   years on 2 soil types in subcoastal, subtropical Queensland. Experiment
   1 examined the effects of 2 stocking rates (0.8 and 1.2 steers/ha) and
   annual rates of P application, ranging from 0-15 kg/ha P, on Siratro.
   Experiment 2 compared the response of Siratro. and Fitzroy to a
   restricted range of P and S treatments.
   Phosphorus application increased the yield of both legumes, but had only
   a negligible effect on the survival of the original plants. However, P
   application to Siratro resulted in the soil seed bank of the treatment
   receiving 15 kg/ha P (P15) being some 5 times higher than in the
   treatment receiving no P (P0).
   This in turn led to more recruitment of Siratro in the P-fertilised
   plots and a 3-fold higher plant density in the P15 treatment compared
   with the PO treatment at the end of the experiment. However, the density
   of Siratro decreased with time as recruitment of new plants did not
   compensate for death of older plants. The lower than median rainfall may
   have adversely affected Siratro recruitment. There was very little
   effect of stocking rate or soil type (red earth or yellow podzolic) on
   Siratro persistence.
   Fitzroy density increased with time whereas Siratro density declined.
   This is attributed to the higher seed set of Fitzroy which lead to
   reserves of soil seed being more than 100 times those of Siratro after 9
   years and to the successful recruitment of stylo plants from seedling
   strikes. Appreciable quantities of viable seed of Fitzroy were excreted
   in cattle dung.}},

   readily identified and located. The U.S. Navy's Geosat radar altimeter
   mission between 1985 and 1989 provided the first altimeter measurements
   with sufficient precision and extended duration to examine the utility
   of such measurements for long-term monitoring of inland waters. These
   measurements have been examined over the Amazon basin. Satellite
   observations are retrieved at four locations that overlap with river
   gauge measurements. A technique is developed to isolate radar return
   signals from the river. Two years of satellite measurements are compared
   with the river gauge retrievals. The overall level of comparison is 0.7
   m rms when the technique is applied manually, and 1.2 m rms when an
   automated version of the method is applied. At one location the average
   difference is 0.2 m rms. This level of accuracy may not be useful for
   routine hydrological measurements. However, there are a variety of
   difficulties that are specific to the Geosat altimeter measurement over
   rough terrain. Present altimeter satellites, ERS 1 (launched June 1991)
   and TOPEX/Poseidon (launched August 1992), correct many of these
   problems. This study suggests that the prospect for obtaining useful
   measurements of river level from space is promising.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal phenology and development of field populations of the
   strawberry bud weevil, Anthonomus signatus Say, were monitored in
   strawberry fields from 1983 to 1987 in southern Quebec. The results
   indicated a consistent 1:1 (male/female) sex ratio in spring and summer.
   The peak period of each life stage could be predicted by accumulated
   degree-days, base 0-degrees-C. The developmental period from egg to
   adult was almost-equal-to 63 d. Measurements are given for each stage.
   A. signatus is a univoltine species, and the summer adults enter a
   reproductive diapause at the beginning of August. Spring adult emergence
   is not gradual but is sudden with tremendous increases within a very
   short period of time. Therefore, because most adults hibernate inside
   the strawberry field, control measures should evaluate the possibility
   of controlling summer populations of the weevil at its maximum summer
   abundance.}},

   the Oregon Cascade Mountains. We monitored emergence from soil cores
   removed from four microsite types and recorded vegetation cover and
   seedling abundance on the site. Over 3 100 seedlings/m2 emerged from the
   greenhouse soil cores; the seed bank was dominated by Juncus species.
   Few vegetative sprouts emerged. Vegetated microsites produced
   significantly more emergents than did bare soils, but even bare soils
   contained abundant seeds. Overall site cover was low and few seedlings
   occurred on the site. Discrepancies between aboveground and belowground
   abundance were common. Phyllodoce empetriformis and Luetkea pectinata
   were abundant in the vegetation and produced many seeds but were poorly
   represented in the seed bank and as seedlings on the site. Other species
   were abundant in the seed bank, but rare in the vegetation. Our results
   indicate that despite the abundance of seeds in bare soil, colonization
   is likely to be extremely slow.}},

Abstract = {{In situ bioassays were conducted using native Adirondack brook trout
   (Salvelinus fontinalis) and blacknose ace (Rhinichthys atratulus) in
   four headwater streams. Conductivity, pH, temperature, and stage height
   were monitored continuously, and water samples for laboratory analysis
   were collected during hydrologic episodes. Fish survived well during
   baseflow conditions, but during periods of spring snowmelt or large
   precipitation events, survival was poor. Blacknose dace were more
   sensitive than brook trout, and mortality was best correlated with the
   log of median inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al(im)) concentration. Brook
   trout mortality was best correlated with a two-variable model that
   included dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and a concentration-duration
   variable (median Al(im) during the episode times the duration of the
   episode). Brook trout mortality was inversely correlated with DOC.
   Bioassay fish that had been in the streams 15-24 d survived episodes
   better than fish that had either not become acclimatized or recovered
   from handling. Duration of exposure to acidic episodes was critical.
   Extended periods of poor water quality resulted in fish mortality and
   may be more important to native populations than short acidic episodes.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that male White-crowned Sparrows
   (Zonotrichia leucophrys) discriminate among song dialects in the context
   of territorial behavior. We studied male response to song stimuli that
   differed systematically from the subjects' local dialect. We created
   four `'hybrid'' songs composed of elements from two adjacent dialects
   and monitored the responses of males from one dialect population to
   these four stimuli and to two unaltered dialect control songs. The most
   potent stimulus was the song from the dialect of the subjects, and the
   least stimulating song was that of the neighboring dialect. When we
   substituted the local dialect introductory components for those of the
   neighboring dialect, the response was as great as that given to the
   local dialect. Substitutions in other portions of the song caused
   decreased response in the subjects. Our results suggest that the vocal
   information controlling the territorial behavior of males in this
   particular dialect population is encoded in acoustic features located in
   the first part of the song.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting the environmental impacts of human activities on natural
   communities is a central; problem in applied ecology. It is a difficult
   problem because one must separate human perturbations from the
   considerable natural temporal variability displayed by most populations.
   In addition, most human perturbations are generally unique and thus
   unreplicated. This raises the problem of deciding whether observed local
   effects are due to human intervention or to the natural differences in
   temporal patterns that often occur among different sites. These problems
   can be successfully addressed with the Before-After/Control-Impact
   (BACI) sampling design, in which Impact and Control sites are sampled
   contemporaneously and repeatedly in periods Before and After the human
   perturbation of interest. In the present case, we use this design to
   examine the ecological effects of the cooling water discharge from a
   coastal nuclear power plant in southern California.
   The results suggest some general lessons about the process of impact
   assessments that are applicable in many ecological contexts. In systems
   where plants and animals are long-lived and recruit sporadically, the
   rates of change in density are often so low that sampling more than a
   few times per year will introduce serial correlations in the data. As a
   result, for studies of few years duration, few samples will be taken. A
   small sample size means that the tests of the assumptions underlying the
   statistical analyses, e.g., independence and additivity, will have low
   power. This injects uncertainty into the conclusions. Small sample size
   also means that the power to detect any but very large effects will be
   low. In our study, sampling periods of 2-3 yr both Before and After the
   impact were not long enough to detect a halving or doubling of
   populations at the impact site. We concluded that there were significant
   environmental impacts because: (1) the effect size was generally very
   large (almost-equal-to -75\%); (2) there was a consistent pattern among
   species; (3) there were two Impact sites, and effects were larger at the
   site nearest the discharge; (4) the observed effects accorded with
   physical changes that could be linked with the source of impact; and (5)
   a number of alternative mechanisms, unrelated to the source of impact,
   were examined and rejected.
   Relative to control populations, there were statistically significant
   reductions in density of snails, sea urchins, and sea stars, all of
   which occurred primarily on rocky substrates. All of the reductions were
   larger at the Impact station about 0.4 km from the discharge than at a
   second Impact station 1.4 km away. The most plausible mechanisms for the
   declines seem to be linked to the turbidity plume created by the power
   plant and the resultant increase in suspended inorganic and organic
   materials (+46\% at the Impact site nearest the discharge). Any
   associated flux of fine particles on rocks would have deleterious
   effects on many of the hard benthos. Populations of two filter-feeding
   species, a gorgonian coral and a sponge, showed relative increases in
   density. Although the increase in populations of filter feeders could be
   related to the ingestion, killing, and discharge of tons of plankton by
   the cooling system, an alternative natural mechanism was also considered
   reasonable.
   Monitoring studies of relatively long-lived organisms will often have
   low power to detect ecologically significant changes in density. The
   present study of kelp forest organisms extended over nearly 6 yr, yet
   the resulting statistical tests generally had power of <30\% to detect a
   doubling or halving in density at a significance level of .05. In such a
   community it would be a mistake to conclude that there were no
   significant ecological effects based on conventional hypothesis tests.
   Unless there is a willingness to accept the fact that changes in natural
   populations on the order of 50\% will often go undetected, the standards
   and types of evidence used to demonstrate environmental impacts must be
   changed.}},

Abstract = {{While probability sampling has the advantage of permitting unbiased
   population estimates, many past and existing monitoring schemes do not
   employ probability sampling. We describe and demonstrate a general
   procedure for augmenting an existing probability sample with data from
   nonprobability-based surveys ('found' data): The procedure, first
   proposed by Overton (1990), uses sampling frame attributes to group the
   probability and found samples into similar subsets. Subsequently, this
   similarity is assumed to reflect the representativeness of the found
   sample for the matching subpopulation. Two methods of establishing
   similarity and producing estimates are described: pseudo-random and
   calibration. The pseudo-random method is used when the found sample can
   contribute additional information on variables already measured for the
   probability sample, thus increasing the effective sample size. The
   calibration method is used when the found sample contributes information
   that is unique to the found observations. For either approach, the found
   sample data yield observations that are treated as a probability sample,
   and population estimates are made according to a probability estimation
   protocol. To demonstrate these approaches, we applied them to found and
   probability samples of stream discharge data for the southeastern US.}},

Abstract = {{A young birch (Betula ermanii) stand was monitored every year for 10
   years from 1982 to 1991 for tree diameter, height, and volume, in
   Hokkaido, northern Japan. Total tree volume of the stand (Y0) increased
   with a corresponding decrease in tree number (N0), giving a
   self-thinning line on a double logarithmic scale expressed as Y0 =
   HN0-c. The reciprocal equation, 1/Y = B/N+A, was applied to the
   relationship between cumulative volume (Y) and cumulative number (N)
   from the largest tree in the stand each year. B-points (N(B), Y(B); N(B)
   = B/A, Y(B) = 1/2A) of each Y-N curve also plotted on a double
   logarithmic scale gave a line parallel with the self-thinning line.
   Kendall's rank correlations of individual tree orders between successive
   two year periods usually lay above 0.936, indicating that the reversion
   of tree order rarely occurred. Increments in tree diameter during the 2
   years immediately before the trees' death were usually very small, while
   increments for living trees were usually positive. Using the Y-N curves
   and the B-point curve, and the two conditions (1) that a tree's order
   does not change with time and (2) that mortality occurs in the smallest
   trees whose growth rate becomes zero, a relation between tree volume and
   number in a stand was derived as a line parallel to the B-point line and
   was demonstrated to be equivalent to the self-thinning line.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the effects of lake acidification on large predatory
   zooplankton, we monitored population levels of four limnetic taxa for 6
   years in a lake with two basins, one of which was experimentally
   acidified (2 years at each of three levels: pH 5.6, 5.2 and 4.7).
   Concentrations of phantom midge (Chaoborus spp.), the most abundant
   large predator, remained similar in the treatment and reference basins
   until the fourth year (pH 5.2) when they increased in the treatment
   basin. In contrast, Epischura lacustris and Leptodora kindtii
   disappeared from limnetic samples, and water mites declined to near zero
   upon acidification. Treatment basin populations of E.lacustris declined
   sharply during the second year of acidification. The nature of the
   decline suggested sensitivity of an early life stage during the first
   year at pH 5.6. Leptodora kindtii showed no population response at pH
   5.6, but declined to essentially zero at pH 5.2. Treatment basin
   populations of water mites fluctuated until declining in the fifth and
   sixth years (pH 4.7). These changes indicate a variety of direct and
   indirect responses to lake acidification.}},

   divinyl Chl a labeling) increased from an initial value of 0.15 d-1 to
   0.96 d-1 following macronutrient addition (N, P, and Si). Diatoms,
   however, were unable to grow without added Fe. Diatom populations were
   severely colimited by Fe and macronutrients but achieved a specific
   growth rate of 2.5 d-1 following Fe and macronutrient additions. Results
   implied that grazing rates (g) on prochlorophytes were stimulated in
   approximate balance with prochlorophyte growth (mu) after 6 d (g: mu =
   0.85), but that grazing processes were not as efficient (g: mu = 0.40)
   at controlling the diatom standing stock. Our results suggest that
   grazing processes may be the most important factor regulating
   procaryotic biomass, but Fe limitation is the proximate control of
   diatom biomass and hence may limit the utilization of macronutrients in
   the equatorial Pacific Ocean.}},

Abstract = {{During April to September, plankton community structure was monitored in
   large enclosures (60 m3) in the presence and absence of planktivorous
   fish. Weekly sampling included inorganic nutrients, oxygen, pH, and
   transparency as well as biomass of phytoplankton, bacteria,
   heterotrophic flagellates, rotifers, and macrozooplankton. In fishless
   enclosures, concentrations of inorganic nutrients and transparency were
   higher than in enclosures with fish, whereas oxygen, pH, and biomasses
   of phytoplankton, picoplankton and rotifers were lower. As an average
   for the entire period, Ch1 a was 14 mug liter-1 in the enclosures
   without fish and 46 mug liter-1 in enclosures with fish.
   Macrozooplankton biomass was significantly lower in enclosures with fish
   than in enclosures without fish. Averaged over the entire period
   macrozooplankton biomass was 625 mug C liter-1 in enclosures with fish
   and 1, 149 mug C liter-1 in those without fish. Cladocerans dominated
   the macrozooplankton community in fishless enclosures and controlled the
   biomass of bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates. The rotifer community
   was depressed in enclosures without fish, which probably was a combined
   effect of mechanical interference with Daphnia and food competition. The
   initial buildup of a high macrozooplankton biomass and the dominance of
   cladocerans in the enclosures without fish, prevented cyanobacteria from
   forming large colonies. In contrast, cyanobacteria (Microcystis,
   Aphanizomenon, and Anabaena) bloomed in the enclosures with fish. The
   observed changes in the plankton communities support the theory of
   cascading trophic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass is a poorly documented parameter of the hydrothermal ecosystem,
   partly due to the difficulties in estimating it. Because the
   hydrothermal alvinellid polychaete worms mostly live in tubes, and on
   very irregular surfaces difficult to sample, an original biomass
   estimation method based on video analysis was proposed and tested on
   populations of the East Pacific Rise at 13-degrees-N. The area covered
   by the 3 main alvinellid species was accurately estimated from
   geometrical calculations in oblique-angle conditions, requiring only 3
   object measurements on the monitor screen. The total density of
   alvinellids was estimated on video by modelling the pattern of worm
   movements in and out of their tubes. The Richards function was found
   appropriate to model the resulting asymptotic curves. Biomass was
   calculated from mean alvinellid weights for populations from 3 white
   smokers and 1 black smoker. Values ranged from 10.7 to 70.1 g ash-free
   dry weight m-2, which is a much lower estimate than in previous studies,
   perhaps because of differences in sample size, sampling methods and the
   heterogeneity of studied assemblages. It was possible to discriminate
   Alvinella spp. from Paralvinella grasslei on the video because of
   differences in behaviour, allowing separate biomass calculations.
   Spatial variability of the alvinellid biomass was assessed f or one
   chimney. Biomass was maximal at the top and the base, and minimal in the
   middle. Coverage of the chimney by the alvinellid tubes was spatially
   heterogeneous, and the genera displayed different distribution patterns.
   P grasslei seems to move a lot and settle on chimneys in an
   opportunistic way, while Alvinella spp., more dependent on the
   environmental conditions, settle at the base and gradually move upwards
   as the chimney grows.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of a genetically engineered strain of Pseudomonas
   fluorescens introduced to the seeds, stems and leaves of maize plants
   was monitored using viable cell counts on selective agars. The bacterium
   was introduced to the seeds under vacuum and stored at either room
   temperature or 5-degrees-C. The bacterium was detected after 1 d, but
   not after 8 d, in seeds stored at room temperature, whereas at the lower
   temperature it was still detected after 43 d. Other inoculated seeds
   were grown either in a nutrient solution or in potting compost. Studies
   of survival within both seed remnants and roots, and on the aerial parts
   of the plants, demonstrated that the majority of bacteria remained in
   the seeds with some movement into the roots. Seeds retained a greater
   colonization frequency than roots in plants grown in both soil and
   nutrient solution. Those plants grown in nutrient solution maintained
   higher bacterial populations in seed remnants and roots than those grown
   in soil. Viable counts of P. fluorescens within seed remnants and roots
   decreased in soil-grown plants over a 43 d monitoring period. No
   introduced organisms were detected in either stem core sections or other
   aerial parts of any of the inoculated plants, yet the cores were shown
   to contain an indigenous population of up to 4.8 x 10(4) cells g-1
   tissue. When mature plants were injected with the bacterium viable
   counts of the pseudomonad below and above the injection points
   demonstrated the ability of the bacterium to translocate in the stem
   after the wounding process. P. fluorescens applied to the leaf surfaces
   remained viable for at least 20 d but showed great variations in numbers
   with values ranging from 0 to 1.4 x 10(6) g-1 tissue. The practical
   applications of introducing genetically engineered microorganisms into
   plants as control measures against pathogens and insect pests are
   briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of vertebrate predation have been monitored since 1989 on 16
   replicated 0.56 ha study plots in a semiarid thorn scrub community in
   north-central Chile. Using fences of different heights with and without
   holes and suspended game netting to alter principal predator (foxes and
   raptors) and large rodent herbivore (Octodon degus) access, four grids
   each have been assigned to the following treatments: 1) low fencing and
   holes allowing free access of predators and small mammals; 2) low
   fencing without holes to exclude degus only, 3) high fencing and netting
   with holes to exclude predators only; and 4) high fencing and netting
   without holes to exclude predators and degus. Small mammal population
   censuses are conducted monthly using mark-recapture techniques. Degu
   population trends during 1989 and 1990 showed strongly but
   nonsignificantly lower numbers in control plots during months when
   densities were characteristically low (September November) for this
   seasonally reproductive species; since March 1991, differences have
   become persistent and increasingly significant. Predators appear to have
   greater numerical effects when their prey populations are low. Survival
   times of degus, particularly established adults, were significantly
   longer in predator exclusion grids during the 2 1/2 years of
   observation; thus, predation also affects prey population structure.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus levels, phenology of roots and shoots, and development of
   vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi were monitored for two
   years in natural populations of the perennial alpine herb, Ranunculus
   adoneus. The purpose of this study was to understand how phosphorus
   uptake relates to the phenology of R. adoneus and to ascertain whether
   arbusculus, fungal structures used for nutrient transfer. were present
   when maximum phosphorus accumulation was occurring. Arbuscules were only
   present for a few weeks during the growing season of R. adoneus and
   their presence corresponded with increased phosphorus accumulation in
   both the roots and shoots of R. udoneus. In addition, phosphorus
   accumulation and peaks in mycorrhizal development occurred well after
   plant reproduction and most plant growth had occurred. The late season
   accumulation of phosphorus by mycorrhizal roots of R. adoneus is stored
   for use during early season growth and flowering the following spring.
   In this way R. adoneus can flower before soils thaw and root or
   mycorrhizal nutrient uptake can occur.}},

Abstract = {{Mast-seeding behaviour was monitored in 18 populations of eight species
   of the African cycad genus Encephalartos between 1988 and 1991. The
   coefficient of variation (V) in annual cone production for each
   population ranged between 88 and 200, indicating large fluctuations in
   reproductive effort between years. Data were collected to determine
   whether mast-seeding reduced levels of predispersal seed predation by
   satiating seed predators in mast years and whether it resulted in a
   reproductive advantage over plants which reproduced more frequently.
   Masting intensity was greatest in those populations in which individual
   plants suffered the highest levels of predispersal seed predation in
   years when only a few plants produced seeds. The principal seed
   predators were two congeneric weevil species, Antliarhinus zamiae and A.
   signatus. which develop exclusively on cycad seeds. The lowest intensity
   of mast-seeding was recorded for cycad populations with low levels of
   seed predation and in which A. zamiae and A. signatus occurred only in
   low numbers or were entirely absent. Larger seed crops appeared to
   result in lower levels of seed predation by A. zamiae and A. signatus in
   four populations of E. altensteinii, and differences in seed crop size
   accounted for 48-66\% of variation in levels of seed predation in
   populations of five cycad species. In one population of E. altensteinii,
   lower levels of seed predation in plants reproducing periodically
   resulted in a reproductive advantage over plants reproducing more
   frequently. These results are consistent with the predator satiation
   hypothesis. However, in most cycad populations, numbers of seed
   predators did not appear to decrease significantly after a period of 2-8
   years between reproductive episodes and, in two of three populations
   examined, periodic reproduction did not increase the number of seeds
   surviving to dispersal over a 4-year period. These results are
   interpreted to mean that periodic reproduction has not evolved in
   response to selection imposed by seed predators. but that selection may
   favour those plants which experience lower levels of seed predation by
   coning in synchrony with the majority of plants in the population.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{1993}},

Abstract = {{For 48 mo we monitored diets and populations of 10 species of predatory
   vertebrates (two foxes, four falconiforms, and four owls) in semi-desert
   scrub at Auco, Chile. Pellets (birds) and feces (foxes) collected
   monthly contained identifiable remains of small mammals, birds,
   reptiles, amphibians, large insects, other arthropods, and (in some fox
   feces) fruits. For non-mammalian prey, seasonal variation in
   availability appeared to be more pronounced than longer-term variation.
   In contrast, availability of the eight species of small mammals varied
   relatively little between predators' breeding and non-breeding seasons
   but declined by an order of magnitude through the first 3 yr of the
   study. Rather than responding to these shifts in food availability by
   diverging in diet during `'lean'' times and converging opportunistically
   during `'fat'' times, predators at Auco responded in idiosyncratic ways.
   Predators of all species tended to maintain species-specific means in
   size of prey taken regardless of shifts in the relative availability of
   prey size classes. Two owl species maintained strict mammal diets
   throughout the decline in mammal abundance, whereas two other owls plus
   the two fox species maintained a tight feeding guild based on arthropods
   as well as mammals and other food groups. The four falconiforms failed
   to maintain consistent diets from season to season, and consequently
   ended up temporarily in unique positions in `'diet hyperspace'' or else
   joined temporarily one of the two consistent guilds. The degree to which
   falconiform diets were unique in a given season showed no clear relation
   to food abundance. Changes in use of habitat did, however, relate to
   changes in food abundance. None of the falconiforms resided continuously
   in the study area throughout the period, and their occurrence was
   particularly sporadic late in our study even for falconiform species
   that were not particularly mammalivorous. The lack of clearcut patterns
   among Auco predators in response to resource-''lean'' and
   resource-''fat'' times may result from one or more of the following: (a)
   from predators' viewpoints, food classes at Auco may be quite discrete,
   inhibiting gradual diet shifts by owls and foxes at least; (b) truly
   opportunistic immigrants that might have increased overall diet overlap
   during `'fat'' times, as sometimes occurs in other consumer assemblages,
   do not exist in the Auco landscape; and (c) despite the pronounced
   decline in small mammal densities. the predator assemblage may have
   remained above the threshold of food limitation through part or all of
   the study.}},

Abstract = {{To determine whether synchronization of birth by female Townsend's voles
   occurs in natural populations as a result of environmental or social
   factors, the temporal pattern of reproduction was monitored in two
   populations of known relatedness. reproduction was most intense from
   April to July and less intense during the infestation by botflies in
   August and September. Synchronization of births was not related to the
   distance between females's nests or activity centers. This suggests that
   habitat characteristics of home-ranges do not cause the synchronization
   of parturitions. There was no correlation between the degree of
   relatedness of females and the synchronization of the birth of their
   litters. Among nearest neighbours, pairs of sisters and mothers and
   their daughters reproducing in the year of their birth had their litters
   significantly more synchronized than other females. Thus neighbouring
   relatives reproduce more synchronously than unrelated neighbours.
   Because related females often breed in communal home-ranges they could
   benefit from synchrony through a reduction of the risk of their pups
   being killed by close-relatives. Voles are thought to be unable to
   recognize their relative's offspring and it is possible that, like
   female wild mice, female Townsend's voles are infanticidal during
   pregnancy and non-infanticidal during lactation.
   The degree of synchrony of the spring onset of reproduction changed
   between years and was not higher among females of high average
   relatedness. Thus the synchrony of the onset of reproduction in spring
   is more a consequence of differences in the condition of individual
   females than determined by the extent of female territoriality.}},

Abstract = {{The soapwort gentian Gentiana saponaria (Gentianaceae) occurs at only
   three sites in Ohio, including a population at the Louis W. Campbell
   State Nature Preserve in Lucas County. Seed production at this
   population was monitored during 5 growing seasons between 1984 and 1991.
   A bagging experiment demonstrated that pollinators were required for
   effective pollination. In 1984-1985 and 1990-1991, more than 90\% of the
   flowers set fruit, indicating that pollinator visitation (primarily by
   bumblebees) did not limit fruit set. Fruit set was unusually low in 1988
   (37\%), perhaps due to effects of drought stress on the plants and/or
   their pollinators. Levels of fruit damage from insect larvae ranged from
   >90\% in 1984-1985 to a low of 37\% in 1990. Seed predators consumed the
   small, winged seeds and also prevented normal fruit development. Uneaten
   seeds within damaged fruits often appeared moldy, and dispersal by wind
   was unlikely. These results suggest that seed predators had a greater
   role in regulating seed production than did pollinators, and that this
   cause of mortality could contribute to a decline in the abundance of G.

Abstract = {{Inverse population trends of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American
   Black Ducks (A. rubripes) in eastern Canada and northeastern United
   States have led many to speculate whether differential productivity and
   survival exist between these closely related forms. Monitoring of
   radio-marked female Mallards and Black Ducks breeding sympatrically in
   the western Adirondack region of northern New York in 1990-1991 showed
   that nest success rates of Mallards (S = 0.51) and Black Ducks (S =
   0.61) were similar (P > 0.10), as was the survival rates of females
   during the 107-day breeding period (5 April - 20 July; Mallard S = 0.88.
   Black Duck S = 0.77). Despite these similarities, a higher proportion of
   Mallards successfully hatched a clutch than did Black Ducks (67\% vs.
   44\%). Thus. Mallards may be more productive than Black Ducks,
   contributing to their increasing numbers throughout Black Duck breeding
   range.}},

Abstract = {{Sequential sampling plans are appealing because fewer observations are
   needed than those needed for fixed sampling plans to make a terminating
   decision when insect populations are sparse or abundant. Wald's
   Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) commonly has been used in
   monitoring insect populations and damages from these populations. At
   times, particularly for moderate infestations, the SPRT with its
   parallel boundaries takes longer than a comparable fixed-sample-size
   method to make a terminating decision. An alternative sequential testing
   procedure called the 2-SPRT for the negative-binomial parameter P is
   demonstrated. The value of the exponent k is assumed to be known. In
   this procedure two one-sided SPRTs are performed simultaneously, which
   results in the convergent boundary lines. The average number of
   observations needed for the terminating decision for medium infestations
   (i.e., for P1 < P < P2) is observed to be considerably smaller than that
   for the SPRT with a slight increase in sampling effort when infestations
   are light or heavy. An application of the 2-SPRT is demonstrated using
   cotton fleahopper, Pseudatomoscelis seriatus (Reuter), data obtained in
   southwestern Oklahoma.}},

Abstract = {{The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), attacking peanut,
   Arachis hypogaea L., in Georgia was identified as Strain B. Based on the
   Brooks-Dyar rule for geometric growth, four nymphal instars occurred on
   peanut. Average length and width (mum), respectively, for the instars
   were (mean +/- SE): first, 207.8 +/-5.4, 120.9 +/- 4.4; second, 314.9
   +/- 8.8, 194.0 +/- 6.4; third, 442.6 +/- 11.2, 289.1 +/- 8.0; and
   fourth, 619.3 +/- 9.2, 428.7 +/- 4.4. Few immatures were found on the
   terminal and second leaf of a lateral branch. They were most abundant on
   leaves 3, 4, and 5, and then numbers declined with an increase in leaf
   age. Immatures occurred on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Immatures
   were equally distributed among the tetrafoliates of a peanut leaf, but
   their location on upper versus lower leaf surface varied over time.
   Yellow sticky traps placed in a horizontal position at ground level or
   at canopy level and with the sticky surface upward were most effective
   in capture of adult sweetpotato whiteflies. The number of immatures on
   peanut leaves was only weakly related to the number of adults captured
   in sticky traps 1 wk earlier.}},

Abstract = {{A 7-yr study on field plots in Lleida, northeastern Spain, was carried
   out to determine the factors that play a major role in the population
   dynamics of cereal aphids in winter under Mediterranean conditions.
   Plots were monitored at 7-10-d intervals from crop emergence until the
   first fortnight in April using a D-vac vacuum net set. Several weather
   and host plant parameters were related to the following aphid population
   changes: (1) seasonal net rates of aphid increase (from the first
   sampling in October or November to 31 March), (2) net rates of increase,
   and (3) k mortality values between consecutive samplings. Population
   dynamics of Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) and Sitobion avenae (F.), the
   species found most frequently, were affected, not only by low
   temperatures causing aphid mortality but also by other factors. Dry and
   cold weather, through the effect they have on host plant phenology and
   quality, reduce aphid developmental rates. Winter minimum temperatures
   and rainfall, the latter by its effect on host plants, seem to be the
   major weather parameters to consider to forecast aphid population levels
   at the beginning of spring.}},

Abstract = {{To assess whether plant phenology may affect potential for host shifts,
   S. altissima and S. gigantea were monitored in the field in Minnesota
   (both host races), in Pennsylvania (S. altissima, sole host), and in a
   Pennsylvania common garden of both host plants from both sites. Plant
   height was measured every other day, and growth rates were calculated
   through the oviposition period in the field and season-long in the
   common garden. Greenhouse-grown S. gigantea from both locations were
   subjected to oviposition by Minnesota Eurosta to compare galling
   susceptibility. Minnesota hosts had more comparable growth rates and
   more intraspecific variability than the same species in Pennsylvania. S.
   gigantea growth peaked earlier and fell more rapidly than that of S.
   altissima for all populations, suggesting an earlier, narrower window of
   host suitability. Pennsylvania S. gigantea will support gall formation,
   but ramet growth rate was significantly less than that of Minnesota S.
   gigantea under greenhouse conditions, and Minnesota Eurosta strongly
   preferred Minnesota ramets to those from Pennsylvania. Variations in
   daily growth rate fluctuations between species may confound Eurosta's
   detection of suitable hosts. These results indicate a higher probability
   of a host shift occurring in Minnesota than in Pennsylvania and may
   indicate why colonization of S. gigantea has not occurred in
   Pennsylvania.}},

Abstract = {{Benefits of trophobiosis between Pheidole megacephala (F.) and Coccus
   viridis (Green) were studied in exclusion experiments in coffee.
   Treatments consisted of trees with ants and no scale natural enemies, no
   ants and no natural enemies, natural enemies and no ants, and ants and
   natural enemies. Ant foraging activity and scale populations were
   monitored weekly. There were no significant differences in green scale
   populations between ant-infested and ant-free trees when natural enemies
   were excluded. This demonstrated that scale survival was not due to
   sanitational benefits from the removal of honeydew by ants. Scale
   populations on ant-free trees with natural enemies were significantly
   different from those on ant-infested trees with natural enemies after
   119 d. Ants had a positive influence on green scale survival by
   interfering with or preying on natural enemies. Ant foraging activity,
   and scale, coccinellid, and parasitoid densities were monitored on
   ant-infested and ant-free trees in a second experiment using different
   ant exclusion techniques. The results were a significant positive
   interaction between ants and scales and a significant negative
   interaction between ants and coccinellid larvae. There were no
   significant interactions between ants and adult coccinellids or
   parasitoids. Green scales declined after 50 d and were not present after
   70 d on trees from which ants were excluded, but scales remained on
   ant-infested trees. This decline followed increases in four species of
   larval coccinellids. It was concluded that ants were necessary for the
   survival of C. viridis in coffee. In the absence of ants, natural
   enemies, primarily larval coccinellids, eliminated C. viridis from
   trees.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-yr evaluation of the biological control agent Nosema locustae
   Canning on grasshoppers was conducted on the National Wildlife Refuge at
   Maxwell, NM. Six 0.1-ha plots were treated with the microsporidian in
   1988; grasshopper densities were monitored in treatment and control
   plots through 1990. In 1988, there was a significant time-by-treatment
   interaction; grasshopper densities were significantly reduced for
   several weeks, with as much as 50\% reduction by the end the season.
   Infections were highest 6 to 8 wk after treatment. Infection rates
   differed significantly across developmental stages and subfamilies.
   Melanoplinae were most heavily infected and suffered the greatest rate
   of mortality. Three additional orthopteran species were added to the
   host range of N. locustae. In the treated plots, in 1988, bird densities
   were significantly higher, and the parasitic wasp Scelio opacus
   (Provancher) was significantly more frequent in egg pods. Spores of N.
   locustae were present in unhatched eggs and early instar nymphs, but no
   spores were observed on egg pods or foam plugs. In June of 1989, density
   of the treated population was similar to that of the controls, but from
   mid-july through mid-August the population density was significantly
   lower in the treated plots. Based on infection and demographic data,
   this second-year population suppression seems to have been the result of
   N. locustae. In 1990, treated and control populations did not differ
   significantly, and both were reduced below the standard treatment
   threshold of 9.6 grasshoppers per square meter.}},

Abstract = {{Pest and predatory mite populations were monitored over a 2 year period
   on grapevines in three viticultural regions of southern Australia (The
   Riverlands, Sunraysia and Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area {[}MIA]). The
   mite pests Brevipalpus spp., Colomerus vitis (Pagenstecher) and
   Calepitrimerus vitis (Nalepa) occurred in each region with a predatory
   mite fauna which showed considerable inter-regional variation in
   incidence, abundance and composition. Nine species of Phytoseiidae, the
   dominant predatory mite family, were recorded inhabiting grapevines. In
   the Riverlands, mite populations were apparently suppressed by two
   phytoseiids (Typhlodromus doreenae Schicha, Amblyseius victoriensis
   (Womersley)) in vineyards on which no insecticide was used and on which
   sulphur and copper were used to control vine diseases. In Sunraysia and
   MIA, vineyards which generally had greater inputs of synthetic
   pesticides, particularly fungicides, five to eight phytoseiid species
   were recorded. However, they were less abundant and appeared to have
   less impact on mite (particularly Brevipalpus spp.) populations. The
   population dynamics of pest and predatory mites on grapevines in
   southern Australia and implications for mite management based on
   biological control are discussed with respect to pesticide (particularly
   fungicide) inputs and phytoseiid biology/ecology.}},

Title = {{POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF SYSTEM-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE (SSK) TO
   STREAM-MANAGEMENT DECISIONS - ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC-ASPECTS}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{1. Stream-management decisions must produce an optimal cost-effect
   ratio, as related to social, ecological and economic concerns.
   Therefore, decisions must be reached in a systematic approach by
   scrutinizing the system-specific knowledge (SSK) provided by many
   disciplines.
   2. This paper is organized into five sections: following the
   introduction (Section 1), Section 2 sets a framework for the numerous
   elements of the SSK that can serve as a checklist to identify
   potentially important topics for a particular management decision;
   Section 3 illustrates errors in stream-management policies that have
   been made because the SSK was not considered; Section 4 demonstrates how
   the SSK can be applied in formulating appropriate stream- and
   water-management policies; finally Section 5 summarizes the major points
   in the context of alternative stream-management strategies.
   3. Examples on limiting values in Europe, restrictions of NH4-N
   emission, and the routine application of the Saprobian index demonstrate
   that current management practices often ignore the SSK.
   4. Combining trivial elements of the SSK we demonstrate how complex
   problems of stream management can be solved, focusing on the sources,
   sinks, and effects of water, organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.
   5. On the basis of costs and effects, we rate various management options
   for a fictitious north German lowland catchment. If that catchment does
   not carry a dense human population, SSK-based management is distinctly
   more efficient than traditional management, which focuses on a minor
   sink (sewer system plus sewage treatment plant).
   6. Stream management ignoring the SSK wastes financial, intellectual,
   and natural resources. If we project the estimated costs for
   water-resource management in Germany over the forthcoming decade on to
   the standards of recent European Community (EC) guidelines concerning
   this subject, a large portion of a sum of around \$US 1-2 trillion
   (10(12)) will be squandered in the EC unless practices change.
   7. The results of our analysis are rather disturbing and suggest that
   totally different practices are needed in legislation, administration
   and execution, monitoring, and research. Therefore, we propose that our
   paper be the starting point for a discussion involving representatives
   of all relevant disciplines about potential priorities for new
   management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The European grape berry moth, Lobesia botrana Denis \& Schiffermueller
   (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is, in its larval stage, one of the most
   serious pests of grapes. It is also a pest of roses in greenhouses and
   of many ornamental and wild plants. During the past decade in Israel,
   Lobesia botrana has begun to cause damage to pear (Pyrus communis)
   orchards. Integrated pest management methods were implemented which
   resulted in a drastic decrease in the cumulative use of non-selective
   pesticides and in the number of treatments. The objectives of the
   present study were to examine the efficacy of some new pheromone
   preparations, visual determination of damage to fruit yield, and
   assessment of pesticide formulations for application. To monitor pest
   populations in pear orchards during the flight period traps baited with
   pheromones were introduced. Biocontrol research was carried out using
   Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner preparations. The efficiency of these
   formulations against the pest has been established.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1987 an insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy has been
   implemented in cotton fields in Israel. To assess the efficacy of the
   IRM strategy, a long-term monitoring program in Helicoverpa armigera
   (Hubner) was undertaken to test the response of this pest to various
   insecticides. The monitoring technique was based on the exposure of
   pheromone trap-caught males to residues of four common compounds
   representing the major groups of insecticides. The diagnostic
   concentrations, established on LC80-90 of a susceptible H. armigera
   field population, were 0.57 mug endosulfan, 0.74 mug cypermethrin, 0.38
   mug methomyl, and 2.0 mug methidathion per scintillation vials.
   Collections of H. armigera moths were done during the cotton growing
   seasons of 1987 through 1991. In general, the results indicate that the
   susceptibility of H. armigera to the test compounds was not appreciably
   altered from 1987 to 1991, although fluctuations during the season were
   observed. In most cases, the resistance levels to the test compounds
   fluctuated in a typical V-shaped curve during the season. The
   susceptibility of H. armigera to the various insecticides observed
   during the course of this study is consistent with the proposition that
   the IRM strategy can be correlated with successful management of
   resistance in this pest.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling summer and fall populations of the Russian wheat aphid,
   Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), on winter wheat, spring wheat, and barley
   in the northwestern United States (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and
   Washington) from 1988 to 1991 resulted in 120 estimates of mean aphid
   density (m aphids per tiller) and the proportion of tillers with
   less-than-or-equal-to T aphids (P(T)), where T is defined as the tally
   threshold. T was set to 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 for the summer
   populations and 0, 1 ... 5,8, and 10 for the fall populations. For each
   T, an empirically determined functional relationship between m and P(T)
   was developed using parameters estimated from the linear regression of
   ln(m) on ln{[}-ln(P(T))]. Variability associated with the m and P(T)
   relationship was found to differ greatly among the T values concerned,
   generally decreasing with increasing T, for the summer populations.
   Small T values, particularly empty tillers (T = 0), may lead to spurious
   estimates of m from P(T). The tally threshold of 20 or 25 aphids per
   tiller is suggested for use in monitoring summer populations of D. noxia
   to reduce the variability and achieve an acceptable error level. The
   variability was low for fall populations on winter wheat despite a
   variable range associated with the values of T, but was minimized when T
   = 2, 3, or 4. Using these T values, half-widths of the 95\% CIs are
   usually <0.5 (which equals an error level {[}SE/m] of almost-equal-to
   0.25). These T values are also recommended for use in estimating the
   aphid populations infesting spring grains during the late spring or
   early summer.}},

Abstract = {{Two mixed (seminatural) populations of the Oriental cockroach, Blatta
   orientalis (L.), were established in identical artificial domestic
   environments contained inside converted steel freight containers. After
   a 10-wk period of acclimation, during which the populations were
   monitored with Roatel traps, one population was treated with an aerosol
   formulation (total release fogger) containing 290 mg of the juvenile
   hormone analogue (S)-hydroprene. The other (control) population was
   treated with aerosol propellant only. These treatments were repeated at
   almost-equal-to 6 monthly intervals for the duration of the experiment.
   Changes in these populations were monitored for a period of 28 mo by
   regular trapping with live-catch Roatel traps. On each occasion, trapped
   insects were counted, sexes were determined, nymphs were assigned to one
   of three arbitrary size categories (small, medium, or large), and adults
   were examined for external morphological deformities. At monthly
   intervals, 20 adult females also were randomly selected from the trapped
   insects and confined with several trapped males, and a record of ootheca
   production and viability was kept. During the first 6 mo of the
   experiment, both populations showed a general increase. Subsequently,
   the population in the control environment remained high for the duration
   of the experiment. In contrast, the population in the environment
   treated with hydroprene gradually declined and was eradicated after 26
   mo. Elimination of the treated population resulted directly from the
   inhibition of reproduction in adult cock-roaches that had been exposed
   to hydroprene during the latter stages of nymphal development. These
   results indicate that the juvenile hormone analogue (S)-hydroprene has
   considerable potential for use as a control agent against populations of
   Blatta orientalis infesting industrial, food manufacturing, and domestic
   premises.}},

Abstract = {{The rusty grain beetle is a cosmopolitan pest of stored products, and
   may cause grain to spoil and heat. The ability of 2-week-old rusty grain
   beetle larvae, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), to complete
   development to the adult stage on undamaged corn kernels was compared
   with development on damaged kernels (undamaged kernels that are slit
   through the germ with a razor blade) and coarsely cracked corn at
   30-degrees-C and 75\% RH. Both the condition of the corn and infestation
   level (1 or 5 larvae per cage) significantly affected the proportion of
   samples in which adults developed. More adults developed in samples
   containing damaged or coarsely cracked corn than in samples containing
   undamaged corn. More adults were produced in samples at the higher
   infestation level. The results indicate that older rusty grain beetle
   larvae can complete development on sound grain, but more complete
   development on damaged grain.
   A long-term test of the ability of rusty grain beetles to infest whole
   corn was also conducted. Ten adults and ten 2-week-old larvae were
   placed on 150 g each of. 1) undamaged kernels, 2) damaged kernels, 3)
   kernels that were sifted to remove dockage but not otherwise selected,
   and 4) coarsely cracked corn. Population growth at 30-degrees-C and 75\%
   RH was monitored over a 36-week period. Population growth on coarsely
   cracked corn was rapid. This treatment was terminated after 20 weeks,
   because the corn was deteriorating and population growth was beginning
   to decline. Final population levels on damaged and unselected com
   kernels were high. There was little population growth on undamaged
   kernels. The results indicate that sound grain is relatively resistant
   to infestation by rusty grain beetles, even when older larvae are
   present. Although commercial grain is susceptible to infestation, rate
   of rusty grain beetle population growth is slow compared to that on
   damaged grain.}},

Abstract = {{Population biology of orange striped oakworm, Anisota senatoria (J. E.
   Smith), was studied in southeastern Virginia. Egg mass size was larger
   on Quercus palustris Muench., pin oak, compared with Q. phellos L.,
   willow oak. Females produced a sex pheromone that attracted male moths.
   Blacklight traps were not effective for monitoring A. senatoria adults.
   Peak male emergence occurred on 2 July, 4 days earlier than female. The
   mean life span was 33.5 days in the laboratory. Pupal mortality was high
   and only 1.2\% of the pupae produced moths in 1989 and 1990. Pupae were
   capable of overwintering for two years in the field. The first report of
   a second generation from September - November was documented. Second
   generation A. senatoria oviposited more egg masses, infested more trees
   and had a longer development time compared with first generation. Large
   egg mass size, pupae that were capable of overwintering for two years
   and the presence of a second generation may partially explain the
   consistent A. senatoria populations that have occurred in southeastern
   Virginia.}},

Abstract = {{A prospective epidemiologic cohort study of 6,000 residentially stable
   and non-smoking Seventh-day Adventists (SDA) in California was conducted
   to evaluate long-term cumulative levels of ambient nitrogen dioxide
   (NO2) in association with several chronic diseases. These diseases
   included respiratory symptoms, cancer, myocardial infarction (Ml), and
   all natural cause mortality. Cumulative ambient concentrations of NO2
   were estimated for each study subject using monthly interpolations from
   fixed site monitoring stations and applying these estimates to the
   monthly residence and work place zip code histories of study
   participants.
   In addition, a personal NO2 exposure study on a randomly selected sample
   of 650 people in southern California was conducted to predict total
   personal NO2 exposure using household and lifestyle characteristics and
   ambient NO2 concentrations. It was found that good predictability could
   be obtained (correlation coefficient between predicted and observed
   values = 0.79) from a model predicting personal NO2. The resulting
   regression equations from the personal NO2 exposure study were applied
   to the epidemiologic study cohort to adjust ambient concentrations Of
   NO2.
   No statistically significant associations were found between either the
   adjusted or unadjusted mean concentration estimates of NO2 and the
   development of new cases of respiratory symptoms or change in
   respiratory symptom severity. Also, no statistically significant
   associations were found between long-term ambient concentrations Of NO2
   and incidence of cancer, Ml, or all natural-cause mortality. However,
   the last three outcomes were based on a larger population that could not
   be adjusted for indoor concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The Particle Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (PTEAM) study
   provided the opportunity to test methodologies for measuring personal
   and microenvironmental PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in a full-scale
   probability-based sample of 1 78 persons and homes in Riverside,
   California during the fall of 1990. The purpose of the study was lo
   estimate frequency distributions of exposure to PM10, PM2.5, and
   selected elements in an urban population. Quality control samples and
   analyses were used to evaluate method performance. These included
   collocated sample collection, field and lab blank filters, sampler and
   balance field audits, and intra- and interlaboratory replicate elemental
   analyses. A portion of the study was also designed to include
   side-by-side operation of the personal and microenvironmental samplers
   with reference method (high-volume and dichotomous) samplers to provide
   an evaluation of method comparability. Over 95\% of the approximately
   2,900 scheduled samples were collected and analyzed, with very few
   losses due lo equipment failure. The method limit of detection for the
   personal and microenvironmental monitor PM10 sampling was 8 mug/m3. Mean
   relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2\% to 8\% were obtained for
   collocated personal and microenvironmental samples. Sampler flow rates
   were within the +/- 10\% accuracy criterion during two field audits.
   Balances operated in a specially designed mobile laboratory were within
   specified tolerances for precision (+/- 4 mug) and accuracy (+/- 50
   mug). Elemental analysis accuracy was measured with standard reference
   materials with biases ranging from 2\% to 7\%. Measurement precision for
   most elements ranged from 2.5\% to 25\% mean RSD. Personal and
   microenvironmental samplers gave median PM10 concentrations that were
   approximately 9\% higher than the dichotomous sampler and 16\% higher
   than the high-volume sampler across 96 monitoring periods at a fixed
   outdoor location.}},

Abstract = {{Raptors and common ravens (Corvus corax) (hereafter called ravens) began
   nesting on towers along a 596-km segment of a 500-kV transmission line
   in southern Idaho and Oregon within 1 year of its construction. We began
   monitoring these nesting populations in 1981 to assess the effectiveness
   of artificial structures in attracting nesting raptors and to provide
   guidelines for enhancing raptor nesting opportunities on transmission
   lines. Within 10 years, 133 pairs of raptors and ravens were nesting
   along the 500-kV line. Rapid colonization of towers along the line
   probably was due to lack of other nesting substrate in the transmission
   line corridor, and the proximity of existing nesting populations in the
   nearby Snake River Canyon. Transmission towers provided both new and
   alternative nesting substrates. Raptors and ravens used all types of
   towers on the line but preferred (all P < 0.05) tower types and sections
   of towers where steel latticework was relatively dense. They tended to
   nest on the same or adjacent towers each year even though a low
   percentage of nests remained intact after the breeding season.
   Destruction of nests by wind was the most common cause of nest failure
   on transmission towers. Artificial platforms protected nests from wind
   damage, and hawks and eagles showed a preference for platforms. Overall
   nesting success of pairs on transmission towers was similar to or higher
   than that of pairs nesting on other substrates. Utility companies can
   enhance raptor nesting opportunities and minimize conflicts with power
   transmission by providing stable nesting substrate that is not directly
   above insulators. Nest site modifications either during or after line
   construction can attract nesting raptors and improve their nesting
   success.}},

Abstract = {{Seven mountain lions (Felis concolor stanleyana) captured in western
   Texas were released in northern Florida and used as surrogates for
   evaluating the feasibility of translocating Florida panthers (F. c.
   coryi). Using radio telemetry, they were monitored daily, except
   Sundays, from 15 June 1988 to 19 April 1989. The lions established
   overlapping home ranges, killed large prey at a predicted frequency, and
   settled into routine movement and feeding patterns before the hunting
   season. However, during the hunting season the lions either were killed,
   or they abandoned their home ranges. Subsequent wanderings into urban
   areas and livestock operations necessitated the early removal of study
   animals. We cannot recommend the introduction of Florida panthers into
   northern Florida at this time. Instead, we recommend further study of
   techniques for establishing viable populations that are compatible with
   the expanding human population.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that the intensity of recruitment of pelagic
   young of temperate marine fishes is determined primarily by events that
   affect young as larvae, and that pelagic processes substantially
   increase variation in recruitment over the level expected from variation
   in spawning output alone. Spawning and recruitment of 6 species of
   Caribbean damselfishes were monitored monthly at a site in Panama for 1
   to 3 yr (1983 to 1987) and 7 to 10 yr (1980 to 1989), respectively.
   Intermensual variation in recruitment strength exceeded corresponding
   variation in spawning output by average factors of at least 1.5 to 3.0
   (and perhaps as much as 4 to 20) among those species. Serial changes in
   seasonally-adjusted monthly spawning output and `resultant' recruitment
   strength were not correlated in any species. Thus, regardless of whether
   or not local populations are self-recruiting, pelagic processes
   evidently do largely control, and substantially enhance, short-term
   variability in recruitment strength in these fishes. Interannual
   variation in recruitment was low in all but one species, in which it
   also exceeded variation in spawning. Thus control of variation in
   recruitment strength by short-term pelagic processes had little or no
   net effect on interannual variation in recruitment in most cases.
   Interspecific differences in recruitment seasonality and in levels of
   variation in mensual and annual recruitment strength (but not mensual
   and annual spawning output) indicate that pelagic processes affect
   recruitment of some of these closely related species to different
   degrees and in different temporal patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The mosquito Haemagogus equinus is a known vector of yellow fever (YF)
   in central America. Seasonal abundance, daily biting activity and the
   age composition of adult Hg.equinus female populations were monitored
   weekly during 1981-82 by human collectors on the ground at Point Gourde
   Forest, Chaguaramas, 16 km west of Port of Spain, Trinidad.
   2. Landing collections of Hg.equinus showed diurnal activity from 06.00
   to 20.00 hours (suntime), with a single peak between 08.00 and 14.00
   hours.
   3. Overall, 5.6\% of Hg.equinus were collected during the dry season
   (December-April) and 94.4\% during the wet season (May-November).
   4. Mean density of Hg.equinus in relation to man ranged from
   0.35/man-day in February to 133/man-day in July, with averages of 2.8 in
   the wet season, 36.9 in the dry season and 22/man-day for the whole
   year.
   5. Monthly parous rates averaged 62.1\% (range 0-88\%); 2.8\% of females
   were 2-pars, another 2.8\% were 3-pars, but no older females of
   Hg.equinus were found (sample size 467).
   6. These age-grading data indicate that Hg.equinus females have
   relatively short life expectancy and hence low vector potential, which
   may help to explain why YF virus has seldom been isolated from this
   vector species.}},

Abstract = {{Five sizes of freshwater microcosms, ranging from 5 to 60 cm2 and
   submerged in a plastic barrel, were colonized by a diverse ciliate
   species pool, two Rotifer species and one Eucypris sp. (Ostracoda).
   Microcosms were linked by dispersal and placed at varying distances from
   the colonization source. The experimental universe was thus considered
   to be an archipelago analogue. The addition of nutrients for
   food-bacteria and a 20\% replacement of the freshwater medium in the
   microcosms every two weeks ensured a constant chemical environment.
   Microcosms were monitored four times over a period of 18 months. A
   distance effect was observed on the species level but not on the average
   number of species. The species-area relationship was estimated by taking
   the average of all the censuses for microcosms of equal size (S =
   0.64A0.16 r2 = 0.97). The isolation of 18 microcosms produced
   area-dependent extinction patterns with a final species-area
   relationship S = cA0.40 (r2 = 0.93) after 90 d of isolation. The result
   support the area-per-se hypothesis, because of homogeneity between
   microcosms (except for area). The results also demonstrate the
   importance of dispersal and spatial heterogeneity for overall population
   persistence and dynamics. A specific example is provided by Stentor
   polymorphus and Colpidium colpoda, which seems to be an impossible
   combination in single microcosms. However, global coexistence is ensured
   due to patchiness and differing dispersal abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Disease progress, host growth and defoliation, and spatial patterns for
   a multiple pathogen, leaf spot disease complex on white clover
   (Trifolium repens) were monitored in four 6-wk growth periods during
   1990 1991 in a natural, 10-ha pasture of white clover and tall fescue
   (Festuca arundinacea) in North Carolina. The disease complex comprised
   summer blight (Rhizoctonia solani), black spot (Pseudomonas
   andropogonis), Stagonospora leaf spot (Stagonospora meliloti),
   Cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora zebrina), Curvularia leaf spot
   (Curvularia trifolii), anthracnose (Colletotrichum trifolii), sooty
   blotch (Polythrincium trifolii), and rust (Uromyces sp.). Estimates of
   disease severity (percent leaf area diseased) for the disease mixture
   and leaf area (cm2) were obtained twice per week for 20 leaves on each
   of 512 plants in four plots. Each plot consisted of two proximal, square
   8 X 8 lattices of 64 plants of the virus-susceptible cultivar Regal and
   the Southern Regional Virus Resistant (SRVR) white clover germ plasm in
   an existing sward of tall fescue. SRVR populations are resistant to
   alfalfa mosaic virus, clover yellow vein virus, and peanut stunt virus.
   A disease severity/leaf area rating scale with 45 categories (nine for
   disease severity, five for leaf area) was used to estimate percent leaf
   area diseased and total leaf area (cm2) for each leaf sampled. Also in
   1991, disease severity and leaf area were estimated once per week for
   all individual leaves on 20 plants each of Regal and SRVR during each
   growth period. Most progress curves for disease incidence (percent of
   plants diseased) and severity were nonmonotonic, and poor fits were
   obtained to linearized, classic growth-curve models (logistic, Gompertz,
   monomolecular). Incidence of virus-infected plants was significantly
   greater for most plots of Regal than for the SRVR germ plasm; however,
   both host populations were similar with regard to shape of progress
   curves and overall disease values (disease maxima and AUDPC) for the
   leaf spot disease complex. No differences were detected between
   virus-free and virus-infected plants in total AUDPC for leaf spot
   severity per 6-wk epidemic. Interactions between host growth (leaf
   expansion or leaf addition) and defoliation accounted for observed
   declines in leaf spot severity between consecutive disease assessments.
   Loss of diseased tissue (defoliation) occurred most often as disease
   severity increased in the latter part of each growth period, and in
   patches or near plot edges. Spatially, values for disease severity
   indicated strongly nonrandom patterns for diseased plants at most
   assessment dates. Temporal shifts in cluster size and shape were
   associated with increasing disease severity, or with defoliation. A
   blocked-quadrat variance procedure detected aggregation for leaf spot
   severity at several, concurrent spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in the phytoplankton community of a small tropical
   reservoir were monitored over a four year period comprising of an
   initial two seasonal cycles during which the water column stratified
   strongly for extended periods each year, and two further seasonal cycles
   after installation of a mechanical aeration system to induce artificial
   destratification.
   In the unmanaged reservoir, the concentration of chlorophyll a at 0.5 m
   reached maximum values (on one occasion > 90 mg m-3) when the water
   column was stratified and the epilimnion was very shallow (ca 2 m
   depth). The hypolimnion at this time was anoxic (less than 2\% oxygen
   saturation) and had a high concentration of bacteriochlorophyll (100-200
   mg m-3).
   The phytoplankton community of the unmanaged reservoir was generally
   dominated by cyanobacteria (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Anabaena
   tenericaulis) during the warmer months of the year (November-March) (but
   replaced by chlorophyta, dinophyceae and euglenophyceae after periods of
   intense rain) and by bacillariophyceae (Synedra ulna var. chaseana, S.
   tenera) during the cooler, dry months.
   In the artificially destratified reservoir (8 h aeration day-1), the
   phytoplankton community was largely dominated by diatoms except after
   depletion of the silica content of the water column which caused diatoms
   to be replaced by cyanobacteria (dominated by A. tenericaulis) and a
   range of chlorophytes.
   The changing pattern of stratification and circulation of the water
   column in the unmanaged reservoir caused repeated disruption of the
   established phytoplankton assemblage with peaks of high biomass
   associated with transient cyanobacterial blooms. Continuous aeration and
   the consequent increase in the ratio mixed: euphotic depth provided
   conditions suitable for dominance of the phytoplankton by diatoms, as
   long as silica was available, and resulted in average chlorophyll levels
   higher than in the unmanaged reservoir (120 +/- 10 v. 64 +/- 9 mg m-2).
   Hierarchical fusion analysis based on the biomass of species
   differentiated the phytoplankton samples into cluster groups that could
   be related primarily to stratification or mixing of the water column.}},

Abstract = {{I discuss briefly how the basic science of ecology contributed to the
   resolution of environmental problems in eight different cases in which I
   have been involved over the past few years. I then draw from 2 decades
   of experience as an academic marine ecologist and biological
   oceanographer to extract general lessons from each case on how
   environmental applications could be improved by better use of the wisdom
   of the field of ecology. The eight cases respresent four pairs of
   contrasts covering a spectrum of applications of ecological science to
   environmental problems: (i) two assessments of the environmental impacts
   from coastal ocean discharges, one evaluated by data collected under
   traditionally designed, self-monitoring programmes largely mandated by
   the agency granting the discharge permit and the other employing an
   academically designed programme of explicit impact testing; (ii) two
   assessments of the effects of offshore oil and gas development, one done
   before exploration drilling to assess the adequacy of available
   environmental information on which to base decisions about drilling
   permits and the other an analysis of natural resource damages after a
   coastal oil spill had occurred; (iii) two evaluations of environmental
   problems conducted by special ad hoc panels created to resolve the
   environmental disputes; and (iv) two examples of how rule-making
   commissions employed ecological insights in the establishment of
   regulations, in one case to preserve environmental quality and in the
   other to manage natural fishery resources.
   From the experience of these eight cases, I derive 38 lessons for the
   future improvement of environmental problem solving by better use of
   ecological sciences. These lessons fall into four categories: (i)
   improvements in study design and analysis; (ii) recognition of the
   importance of the multi-species, multi-factor ('ecosystem') context in
   which populations are nested; (iii) acknowledgement of how social
   concerns constrain environmental decisions; and (iv) identification of
   common fallacies in environmental assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional environmental studies have employed sampling at different
   times, but based on re-randomized `replicate' samples taken at each
   time. For example, in a 4 year monitoring study of near-shore marine
   benthic communities there might be three box cores collected annually at
   each of three depths along each of three transects. Repeated measures
   designs, long used in medicine and the social sciences, are based on
   resampling replicates (e.g. sites) at a series of times. In such designs
   spatial sampling variability is not used for tests of environmental
   impact. Error for such tests is based on variability of time trends
   among similar sites (similar with respect to impact). For example in a
   tropical oil spill study five oiled and five unoiled coral reefs were
   studied over 5 years. Error for tests of oil impact was based on
   variability among reefs (within degree-of-oiling category) in the
   year-to-year trends of biological response variables. It was not based
   on variability among field samples within reefs at given times.
   The two approaches (univariate and multivariate) to repeated measures
   analysis of variance are described. The pros and cons of each are
   discussed, as are the assumptions and consequences of their violations.
   Emphasis is especially placed on the adequacy of error degrees of
   freedom in the two approaches, and some exploration of power to detect
   impact is presented. Examples of application of repeated measures
   designs to various impact and monitoring studies are presented and
   discussed, including (i) interpretation of significant effects; (ii)
   decomposition of effects by contrasts (e.g. before vs after impact); and
   (iii) modelling time trends by polynomial and cosine functions.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal in tigers was studied in Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal.
   Thirty six adult and young were studied to monitor movements and social
   interactions relative to dispersal. Fourteen subadults were followed
   from before their dispersal until they died or established
   post-dispersal territories. Subadult tigers became semi-independent of
   their mother when her next litter was born. They usually remained within
   her natal area until the subsequent litter began to move with her at
   about 2 mos of age. Animals dispersed between 19 and 28 mos. Males
   dispersed farther than females and settled in poorer habitat. Three of 4
   females settled adjacent to their mothers; in two cases the mother
   shifted her territory allowing the daughter to take over a large portion
   of the mother's former territory. Wounds on young prior to dispersal
   indicated that aggression prompted dispersal. Fights were observed
   between dispersers and residents. After fights, dispersers always left
   the resident's area. All 4 dispersing females established breeding
   territories. Females settled next to their mothers tending to reduce the
   genetic variance of a male's offspring. Eight of 10 males became
   localized in temporary, post-dispersal territories; 4 of the 8 survived.
   Two males died of poisoning and 2 from intrasexual aggression. Surviving
   males either expanded temporary territories or shifted to new areas to
   establish breeding territories. The Chitwan tigers are an isolated
   remnant of a population once continuous across the lowlands of Nepal.
   Effective population size was estimated to be <30 animals. Tigers did
   not disperse across cultivated areas but did travel through degraded
   forest habitat. No animal dispersed outside the Chitwan region and there
   appear to be effective barriers separating Chitwan from the two nearest
   populations 150 and 250 kms distant. The Chitwan population is probably
   one of the largest tiger populations remaining in the world. Isolation
   and small size threaten these populations with stochastic events that
   may lead to further reduction in population size.}},

Abstract = {{Some components of the food-related behaviour (biting, feeding, walking
   on the plant or walking elsewhere, and resting) of two North American
   and three European Colorado potato beetle (CPB) populations, on six
   solanaceous plant species were monitored with the help of a
   microcomputer-based program, testing the hypothesis whether populations
   showed differences at the behavioural level to alternative host plants
   (S. melongena, S. dulcamara, and Lycopersicon esculentum), as well as to
   non-host plants occasionally encountered (S. luteum, S. nigrum). The few
   significant differences found were among populations of the same
   continent in 1) the number of activities monitored, 2) the duration of
   feeding periods, 3) the number of bites taken to the onset of feeding,
   4) the `amount of behavioural plasticity', and 5) the `behavioural
   diversity'. On the basis of two-way ANOVA analyses, no
   plant-by-population interactions were detected indicating that the CPB
   populations studied did not have specific relationships with any of the
   plant species tested. The lack of substantial differences in
   food-related behaviour was unexpected since considerable isolation in
   space and time exists between the populations occurring on the two
   continents.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring exposure to alkylating agents may be achieved by
   quantitatively determining the adduct levels formed with nucleic acids
   and/or proteins. One of the most significant results arising form the
   application of this approach has been the discovery in control
   populations of `'background'' levels of alkylated nucleic acid bases or
   alkylated proteins, in particular hemoglobin (Hb). In the case of Hb, a
   wide variety of such adducts have been detected and quantitated by mass
   spectrometric techniques, with methylated, 2-carboxyethylated, and
   2-hydroxyethylated modifications being most abundant. Although the
   source of these alkylation products is unknown, both endogenous and
   exogenous sources may be proposed. We have recently confirmed the
   presence of the N-terminal hydroxyethylvaline adduct in control human Hb
   using tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) and have now established
   background levels using GC-MS in more than 70 samples. Smoking raises
   the levels of the adduct up to 10-fold and occupational exposure to
   ethylene oxide up to 300-fold.
   Background levels of alkylated nucleic acids may be studied by analysis
   of N7-alkylated guanine or N3-alkylated adenine, which are excised from
   nucleic acids after their formation and are excreted in urine. Although
   the presence of some of these urinary constituents may be accounted for
   by their natural occurrence in RNA or diet, the endogenous or exogenous
   source of others is unknown. Quantitative methods using MS-MS have now
   been developed for five of the observed urinary alkylguanines
   {[}N7-methyl-, N2-methyl-, N2-dimethyl-, N7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-, and
   N2-ethylguanine].  A GC-MS method has also been developed to measure
   urinary thymine glycol as a possible monitor of oxidative DNA damage.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced species have created environmental benefits and unanticipated
   disasters so a priori assessments of species introductions are needed
   for environmental management. A checklist for assessing impacts of
   introduced species was developed from studies of introduced species and
   recommendations for planning introductions. Sterile, triploid grass carp
   (Ctenopharyngodon idella) are just beginning to be used as a biocontrol
   agent for the management of aquatic vegetation in open waterways.
   Potential impacts of grass carp in open systems were identified by
   reviewing grass carp biology relative to the impact assessment
   checklist. The potential consequences of introduced grass carp were
   reviewed for one case study. The case study demonstrated that
   conclusions about potential impacts and monitoring needs can be made
   despite incomplete information and uncertainty.
   Indicators of environmental impact and vulnerability of host systems
   were grouped into six categories: population control, hybridization,
   diseases and parasites, habitat alterations, biological effects, and
   management issues. Triploid grass carp can significantly alter habitat
   and biological resources through the secondary effects of reductions in
   aquatic vegetation. Potential impacts and significant uncertainties
   involve fish dispersions from plant control areas, inability to control
   vegetation loss, loss of diverse plant communities and their dependent
   species, and conflicts with human use of the water resource. Adequate
   knowledge existed to assess most potential consequences of releasing
   large numbers of triploid grass carp in Guntersville Reservoir, Alabama.
   However, the assessment of potential impacts indicated that moderate,
   incremental stockings combined with monitoring of vegetation and
   biological resources are necessary to control the effects of grass carp
   and achieve desirable, intermediate plant densities.}},

Abstract = {{The time and space scales of an `'upwelling shadow'' in northern
   Monterey Bay, California, were assessed using hydrographic monitoring
   and satellite imagery. Thirteen cruises were conducted over a 15-month
   period (March 1988-May 1989) to discern the hydrographic environment of
   northern Monterey Bay. During the upwelling season of both years, the
   upwelling shadow was identified in the bay as a buoyant, warm-water
   feature about 10 m thick. This nearshore feature, separated by a
   distinct `'retrograde'' front from cold, recently upwelled water
   offshore, is reminiscent of estuarine plume fronts. The front usually
   occurred approximately 6.5 km from shore and appeared to be recurrent
   during upwelling season. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometry
   (AVHRR) satellite imagery of sea surface temperature was reviewed daily
   for the period from january 1, 1988 to December 31, 1989. From these
   images, it was determined that the upwelling shadow characterized
   through hydrographic monitoring clearly extended across northern
   Monterey Bay for approximately 20 km. The feature appeared to persist
   for as long as 67 d in 1988 and 86 d in 1989. The unusual
   spatio-temporal relationship of the feature (spatially small, yet
   long-lived) may allow for the decoupling of time and space effects when
   considering biological processes which occur around nearshore fronts.}},

Abstract = {{In invertebrates, hemocytes play important roles in defense mechanisms.
   The hemocytes of a solitary ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, are a source
   of two antibacterial substances (halocyamines) and a
   lipopolysaccharide-binding (LPS-binding) hemagglutinin that is capable
   of agglutinating various bacteria. Furthermore, a metallo-protease is
   released from the hemocytes in response to treatment with LPS, a calcium
   ionophore, or phorbol ester. In the present study, we attempted to
   fractionate the hemocytes to determine which of them contain the
   LPS-binding hemagglutinin and release the metallo-protease in response
   to various stimuli. The hemocytes of H. roretzi can be separated into
   five groups (L1-L5) by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in
   a solution of bovine serum albumin. The various populations of hemocytes
   exhibit structural differences that can be monitored by electron
   microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. The LPS-binding hemagglutinin,
   together with halocyamines, was found in group L5, which consists of
   only one type of hemocyte. The hemocytes in groups L1, L3, and L4
   released the metallo-protease in response to various stimuli, whereas at
   least those in group L5 did not. These results indicate that the various
   groups of hemocytes of H. roretzi can be distinguished functionally from
   one another on the basis of cellular responses and the ability to
   produce defense substances.}},

Abstract = {{Turtle assemblages at two adjacent farm ponds in east-central Alabama
   were monitored during 1972-1974 and 1988-1990. At pond 1 a drift fence
   with pitfall traps was constructed during both study periods. Aquatic
   trapping was conducted in both ponds during both study periods. Pond 1
   had been fertilized for 15 consecutive years prior to 1972-1974 but
   subsequently received no fertilizer. Aquatic vegetation was absent in
   pond 1 during 1972-1974 but was dense by 1988. Pond 2 had almost no
   fertilization history and underwent little vegetational change over
   time. In both study periods pond 1 had a higher density of Kinosternon
   subrubrum, and both ponds held more K. subrubrum during 1972-1974 than
   during 1988-1990. Twenty-three K. subrubrum marked during 1972-1974 were
   still alive during 1988-1990; all but one individual were six years old
   or older when first captured. Physical condition was inversely
   proportional to density: individual K. subrubrum during 1972-1974
   weighed less per cm than their descendants during 1988-1990, and female
   K. subrubrum in pond 1 weighed less per cm than females in pond 2. In
   contrast to K. subrubrum, populations of Trachemys scripta and Chrysemys
   picta exhibited relatively stable abundances through time. Sternotherus
   odoratus was the only species to show an obvious increase in abundance
   with time in both ponds. Chelydra serpentina decreased in abundance in
   pond 1, while remaining scarce in pond 2. These results may be due to
   several factors, including colonization, fertilization, cattle grazing,
   and succession.}},

Abstract = {{The size of the Badger population in the Netherlands is estimated on the
   basis of sett surveys in 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990. The numbers of used
   important setts were 588, 640, 405 and 606, respectively. So there were
   strong fluctuations especially due to the drop (-36\%) in 1980. In 1990
   the number of used important setts nearly returned to the level of 1960.
   However, there were important regional differences. There was a strong
   increase in areas with large woodlands, mainly in the central part of
   the country. In the south, with more traffic, farming and urbanization,
   the numbers remained 20-30\% lower than in 1960, despite the fact that
   traditionally these were the best Badger areas. Only 25\% of the
   important setts used in 1960 were still in use in 1990. The growth of
   the number of collapsed or lost setts increased considerably during
   those 30 years, indicating a rather large sett turnover probably due to
   disturbance or a related stress factor. Some possible causes of the
   fluctuations are discussed. It is recommended that a monitoring scheme
   be carried out every 2 or 3 years in some key areas, in order to get a
   better idea of the short-term fluctuation range of the population. For
   one-off, single-observation surveys, a simpler and more-robust sett
   classification is desirable, based on the number of intact holes,
   instead of on `main setts'.}},

   levels in natural and experimental populations of eelgrass is
   illustrated with examples from the field and a mesocosm experiment.
   Using the Wasting Index, monitoring of the disease along with
   environmental variables provided correlational data that aided
   understanding of the disease progression and linked disease severity
   with salinity. Once salinity increased above d threshold, disease spread
   rapidly and was inversely correlated with leaf area (infection phase).
   Following the initial peak of disease, the Wasting Index was positively
   correlated with leaf area (wasting phase). Declines in salinity below
   the threshold (caused by precipitation or spring runoff) allowed
   eelgrass recovery and reset the host-pathogen system.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the relative influence of planktonic processes and larval
   production on the larval supply and recruitment of the damselfish
   Pomacentrus amboinensis during 2 summers at Lizard Island, northern
   Great Barrier Reef. Larval production was quantified by monitoring the
   nest sites of males in windward, lagoon and leeward habitats. Larval
   supply was estimated using light traps deployed in nearshore waters
   adjacent to the 3 habitats. Recruitment patterns were back-calculated
   from the otoliths of newly settled fish collected from small artificial
   patch reefs constructed in each of the 3 habitats. Temporal patterns of
   spawning, larval supply and recruitment were correlated when the
   spawning pattern was lagged by a period equivalent to the incubation
   time of eggs and the average planktonic life. This coupling occurred
   despite a change in the pattern of spawning between summers from
   occasional, large episodes to frequent, smaller pulses spread throughout
   the summer. Once regular cycles were removed from the data sets by ARIMA
   (integrated auto-regressive moving-average) modelling, correlations
   between patterns declined or became non-significant. This suggests that
   reproduction has an important influence on the timing of recruitment,
   but that the magnitude of these events is largely determined within the
   plankton.}},

Abstract = {{Increased complexity in biological communities can increase the variety
   of interactions among species, but the relative strengths and long-term
   consequences of various direct and indirect interactions require further
   investigation. I studied interactions among four species of protists by
   monitoring their population dynamics when they were cultured either
   together or in seven different subset communities. Two protists were
   bacterivores (Chilomonas and Tetrahymena) and two were predators
   (Actinosphaerium and Euplotes). Actin-osphaerium was omnivorous, and
   could eat both predatory Euplotes and bacterivores. Three indirect
   effects occurred among the four species of protists, including indirect
   facilitation of one predator by the other, apparent competition between
   bacterivores, and indirect facilitation of one bacterivore by the
   omnivorous predator. Community structure and invasibility depended on
   both direct and indirect effects; thus both can be mechanisms for
   assembly rules.}},

Abstract = {{Incidence and spatial patterns of eight foliar pathogens and diseases
   were monitored during two 6-wk growth periods per year from June to
   September in 1990 and 1991 on regularly spaced plants of white clover
   (Trifolium repens) planted in a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) sward
   in a 10-ha pasture in Wake County, North Carolina. Disease ratings were
   made in four plots on a total of 512 plants in eight square lattices of
   64 plants each. Each plot comprised two proximal lattices of either the
   virus-susceptible white clover cultivar, Regal, or the Southern Regional
   Virus Resistant white clover germ plasm. Incidence of three viruses
   (alfalfa mosaic virus, clover yellow vein virus, and peanut stunt virus)
   was assessed by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in June or
   July, August, and September. Per-plant incidence of the following leaf
   spot diseases was assessed on 16 dates during 1990-1991: black spot
   (Pseudomonas andropogonis), Cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora zebrina),
   Curvularia leaf spot (Curvularia trifolii), summer blight (Rhizoctonia
   solani), and Stagonospora leaf spot (Stagonospora meliloti).
   Two-dimensional distance class analysis was used to quantify spatial
   attributes of viral and leaf spot epidemics on the two white clover host
   populations. Virus-resistance altered the spatial pattern of the virus
   disease complex. Viral epidemics in populations of Regal were
   characterized by higher disease incidence, stronger aggregation of
   diseased individuals, more numerous and larger clusters of
   virus-infected plants, and stronger edge effects than for those in
   populations of the Southern Regional Virus Resistant germ plasm. Spatial
   patterns of the leaf spot diseases were similar in the virus-resistant
   and virus-susceptible host populations. In general, spatial patterns of
   the fungal and bacterial leaf spot diseases reflected the gradient and
   mode of pathogen dispersal. Significant edge effects and large,
   well-defined, expanding clusters were characteristic of the
   splash-dispersed pathogens, P. andropogonis and S. meliloti. Smaller
   clusters (in plot interiors rather than plot edges) were found for the
   aerially dispersed pathogens C. zebrina and Curvularia trifolii, which
   have shallower dispersal gradients. Defoliation throughout the epidemics
   was related to continual changes in disease incidence, strength of
   aggregation and cluster location, and morphology. Variability in spatial
   attributes between and within years, among plots, and between growth
   periods suggest the importance of environment (e.g., rainfall,
   temperature) and cultural practices (e.g., harvest) as determinants of
   spatial patterns in this pathosystem.}},

Abstract = {{I examined the characteristics and dynamics of a population of wild
   steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Little Manistee River, an extremely
   stable-flow, low-gradient (sandy) tributary of Lake Michigan. I
   monitored autumn parr populations by electrofishing (1981-1983), and I
   monitored spring emigrant populations at a weir near the river mouth
   (1982-1984) and both autumn- and spring-returning adults at this weir
   (1979-1987). Relative to other Great Lakes populations, steelhead in the
   Little Manistee River had several notable characteristics that are
   probably linked to abundant groundwater and stable flows: (1) high
   abundances of age-1 parr, smolts, and adults, (2) constant autumn age-1
   parr densities, (3) few emigrant parr, (4) fast growth when in the
   stream environment, and (5) relatively late age at maturity (after 3
   years in the lake). An excessive sand bed load occurs in the
   low-gradient sections of the river, limiting gravel spawning areas to
   higher-gradient sections. This limited spawning area likely caused the
   relatively low abundance of age-0 parr, and may also be a factor in late
   age at maturity. Abundance and age structure of returning adults varied
   because of (1) variable survival during the presmolt winter (13-90\%),
   (2) variable survival from smolt to maiden adult (6-29\% for spring-run
   maiden spawners), and (3) variable survival to repeat spawn (3-58\%).
   Most adults returning from a marked smolt cohort originated in the
   Little Manistee River (mean +/- 95\% confidence limit, 71 +/- 28\%).
   Management of such populations needs to focus on protecting and
   enhancing the stream environment, and on managing sport harvest.
   Modeling population dynamics will require development of long-term data
   sets.}},

Abstract = {{Results of a literature survey indicate that weed population density and
   biomass production may be markedly reduced using crop rotation (temporal
   diversification) and intercropping (spatial diversification) strategies.
   Crop rotation resulted in emerged weed densities in test crops that were
   lower in 21 cases, higher in 1 case, and equivalent in 5 cases in
   comparison to monoculture systems. In 12 cases where weed seed density
   was reported, seed density in crop rotation was lower in 9 cases and
   equivalent in 3 cases when compared to monocultures of the component
   crops. In intercropping systems where a main crop was intersown with a
   `'smother'' crop species, weed biomass in the intercrop was lower in 47
   cases and higher in 4 cases than in the main crop grown alone (as a sole
   crop); a variable response was observed in 3 cases. When intercrops were
   composed of two or more main crops, weed biomass in the intercrop was
   lower than in all of the component sole crops in 12 cases, intermediate
   between component sole crops in 10 cases, and higher than all sole crops
   in 2 cases. It is unclear why crop rotation studies have focused on weed
   density, whereas intercropping studies have focused on weed biomass.
   The success of rotation systems for weed suppression appears to be based
   on the use of crop sequences that create varying patterns of resource
   competition, allelopathic interference, soil disturbance, and mechanical
   damage to provide an unstable and frequently inhospitable environment
   that prevents the proliferation of a particular. weed species. The
   relative importance and most effective combinations of these weed
   control tactics have not been adequately assessed. In addition, the
   weed-suppressive effects of other related factors, such as manipulation
   of soil fertility dynamics in rotation sequences, need to be examined.
   Intercrops may demonstrate weed control advantages over sole crops in
   two ways. First, greater crop yield and less weed growth may be achieved
   if intercrops are more effective than sole crops in usurping resources
   from weeds or suppressing weed growth through allelopathy.
   Alternatively, intercrops may provide yield advantages without
   suppressing weed growth below levels observed in component sole crops if
   intercrops use resources that are not exploitable by weeds or convert
   resources to harvestable material more efficiently than sole crops.
   Because of the difficulty of monitoring the use of multiple resources by
   intercrop/weed mixtures throughout the growing season, identification of
   specific mechanisms of weed suppression and yield enhancement in
   intercrop systems has so far proven elusive.
   Significant advances in the design and improvement of weed-suppressive
   crop rotation and intercropping systems are most likely to occur if
   three important areas of research are addressed. First, there must be
   continued attention to the study of weed population dynamics and
   crop-weed interference in crop rotation and intercropping systems. More
   information is needed concerning the effects of diversification of
   cropping systems on weed seed longevity, weed seedling emergence, weed
   seed production and dormancy, agents of weed mortality, differential
   resource consumption by crops and weeds, and allelopathic interactions.
   Second, there needs to be systematic manipulation of specific components
   of rotation and intercropping systems to isolate and improve those
   elements (e.g., interrow cultivation, choice of crop genotype) or
   combinations of elements that may be especially important for weed
   control. Finally, the weed-related impacts of combining crop rotation
   and intercropping strategies should be assessed through careful study of
   extant, complex farming systems and the design and testing of new
   integrated approaches.
   Many aspects of crop rotation and intercropping are compatible with
   current farming practices and could become more accessible to farmers if
   government policies are restructured to reflect the true environmental
   costs of agricultural production.}},

Abstract = {{1. The Butterfly Monitoring Scheme uses regular transect counts on fixed
   sites to establish annual indices of abundance of butterfly species in
   the United Kingdom. The annual change in collated index for each species
   has hitherto been calculated as a simple ratio between total counts
   summed over all participating sites.
   2. A revised method for calculation of collated indices is proposed,
   which applies a logarithmic transformation to site values so as to
   downweight the influence on the index of the sites with greatest numbers
   of a species. Zero counts are handled comparably with non-zero values.
   An alternative method using geometric mean ratios is also examined.
   3. Indices calculated using the logarithmic transformation are compared
   with those calculated using the traditional method. Two internal tests
   of dependency of collated indices on the sites with highest abundance
   are made. Another evaluation uses regression analysis for the effects of
   temperature and rainfall on collated indices of butterfly abundance.
   4. The first internal test shows that logarithmic transformation reduces
   the dependence of the collated index on the sites of highest abundance
   for twenty-five out of twenty-seven species examined; while a second
   test shows a reduction for twenty-six out of forty-two species, and an
   increase for one species. The number of significant regressions on
   temperature variables increases with the use of the logarithmic
   transformation from 11\% to 13\% of tests made, and on rainfall from
   10\% to 11\%.
   5. The geometric mean ratio method introduces considerable biases in its
   treatment of zero values, for which a remedy is not available.
   6. Although the revised collated indices calculated using logarithmic
   transformation are broadly comparable with traditionally calculated
   values, the reductions in dependency on sites with the most abundant
   populations render the revised indices less subject to perturbation due
   to local `noise', and so more suitable for research on factors
   influencing butterfly abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in response to insecticide in codling moth, Cydia pomonella
   (L.), was surveyed in California, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Two
   techniques (topical application and direct incorporation of insecticide
   into the trap adhesive) were used to assay male moths caught in
   pheromone traps. Using the LC75 from a susceptible population as a
   standard dose, we monitored 20 apple and pear orchards for resistance to
   azinphosmethyl by the topical application technique. Orchards in
   California had the greatest interpopulation variability in resistance
   levels. In a single pear orchard in the Sacramento Delta, the level of
   resistance at the LC50 was almost-equal-to 6.2 and 7.2 times greater
   than in a susceptible population when bioassays were done by topical
   application and adhesives were mixed with insecticide, respectively.
   Residual bioassays with neonate larvae collected from this site
   indicated 4.6-fold resistance. Orchards in Oregon showed little
   variability, and all populations appeared to be susceptible. Populations
   from Utah orchards showed little variability in the bioassay and were
   the most susceptible in the four states tested. Populations collected
   from Washington orchards had the highest tolerance levels. In laboratory
   tests, female moths were as susceptible as male moths in bioassays with
   treated adhesive. In similar tests, 5-7-d-old moths were more
   susceptible than moths 2.5-4.5 and 0-2-d-old, whereas no significant
   difference was detected between the latter two groups. With the topical
   adult assay, baseline data were collected for the pyrethroid
   esfenvalerate from 13 orchards in California, Utah, and Washington.
   Little variability in susceptibility to esfenvalerate was found among
   populations within each state.}},

   as hybridization probes. The diversity of strains within the field
   population could first be detected with IS-fingerprinting, whereby
   nearly three times more groups of Rhizobium meliloti strains could be
   identified in comparison to the groups according to plasmid profiles.
   This complexity and diversity of the rhizobial population was also
   detected in microcosm studies. Strains identified among the field
   population were also detected in the microcosm studies. The persistence
   of rhizobia in soil was demonstrated in soil core samples held in a cold
   room for 2 years. A decrease in the genomic diversity of the R. meliloti
   population upon soil storage was observed. A novel monitoring method,
   IS-handprinting, in which the presence of certain endogenous insertion
   elements within a strain is registered, was successfully employed to
   characterize genetically the field R. meliloti strains with simplicity
   and speed. In contrast to IS-fingerprinting, IS-handprinting is based on
   a simple plus-or-minus detection, which is sufficient for a taxonomic
   characterization. Both methods, using a non-radioactive detection
   system, are sensitive enough to detect one copy of an insertion element
   in a strain's genome. IS-fingerprinting, with its fine resolution, would
   be suitable for ecological studies of individual strains in any complex
   ecosystem, whereas IS-handprinting would be suitable for monitoring
   strains and characterizing large numbers of strains.}},

Abstract = {{Two chemical accidents with insecticides in the River Rhine, i.e. the
   endosulfan accident in 1969 and the Sandoz accident in 1986, played an
   important role in public and political awareness regarding water
   pollution. The endosulfan accident gave cause for the development of a
   chemical monitoring and sanitation programme, whereas the Sandoz
   accident accelerated this sanitation programme and triggered a number of
   eco(toxico)logical studies and their implementation in water quality
   control.
   The gradual decrease in concentrations of organophosphorus insecticides
   since 1977 coincided with the recolonization of a number of insect
   species in the Lower Rhine. First some species of chironomids appeared
   and later the caddisflies Hydropsyche contubernalis followed by Ecnomus
   tenellus. Ecological research before, during and after the Sandoz
   accident showed that chironomids and caddisflies occurring in large
   numbers in the IJssel, a branch of the River Rhine, were affected by the
   Sandoz accident. After the Sandoz accident, the pattern of
   recolonization showed the same sequence. Again, various chironomid
   species were among the first to recolonize, whereas recovery of
   caddisfly populations lasted longer. It appeared that for all species no
   more than one generation was needed for recovery, whereas the second
   generation showed complete recovery.
   In general terms it means that species requiring stable conditions, e.g.
   because of their long life-cycle, will not be able to maintain
   self-sustaining populations in the Rhine where different stress factors
   are operating.}},

Abstract = {{From 1984 to 1991, 126 males and females were marked and monitored in a
   wild population of Propithecus verreauxi in southwest Madagascar.
   Animals were assigned birth years, based on known birth date or degree
   of dental wear calibrated by recapture data. Twenty-one of 27 groups
   identified in 1984 persisted within stable home range boundaries, 6
   groups disappeared, and 6 new groups formed. Only males transferred
   between existing groups, although individuals of both sexes left groups
   to form new groups. The home range of the group into which a male
   transferred usually overlapped that of his group of origin. On average,
   35\% of males aged 3-6 years transferred each year. Older males
   transferred at a lower rate. Three to 6-year-old males were more likely
   than older males to transfer two or three times. Most 3-6-year old males
   transferred into groups with a higher proportion and number of females,
   whereas older males were progressively more likely to transfer into
   groups with a lower proportion and number of females. New groups were
   formed by older males, whose mates had died or who had not been
   successful in joining an existing group, and by young, nulliparous
   females. Males have rarely been observed for more than 5 years in the
   same group. Dispersal by 3-6-year-old males appeared to be voluntary.
   Females helped evict non-natal males from the group but did not prevent
   new males from joining. Age at first reproduction was 5 years in this
   population. Forced secondary dispersal may occur when maturing females
   cease to tolerate males who may be their fathers.}},

Abstract = {{Fifteen raccoons were fitted with radio-transmitters and monitored from
   March 1987 to May 1988; 1091 locations were classified according to
   occurrence within three available den types: tree cavities, rock
   outcroppings and ground burrows. Overall use generally reflected
   availability of dens, but den use varied across seasons and among
   raccoons of different age and sex. Rock dens were used most often during
   winter, especially when temperatures fell below freezing; adult males
   showed the most frequent and consistent use of rock dens. Ground burrows
   were consistently used more often by juveniles, especially males, as
   compared to adults. Use of ground burrows by the raccoon population was
   greatest during autumn. Females consistently used tree cavities more
   frequently than males; the greatest disparity occurred during summer and
   was associated with parturition and rearing of young.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of overfishing of marine invertebrates is complex, ranging
   from the perception of overfishing because of competition by user groups
   for a common property resource to extensive overfishing to near
   extinction because of poaching by either licensed or unlicensed fishers.
   As a group, marine invertebrates seem particularly resistant to
   overfishing, primarily because their relative immobility and scattered
   concentrations means refuge populations often exist. However, this
   distribution pattern also means a fishery is scattered over an often
   large geographical area with relatively small, frequent landings at any
   location. A minimum legal size regulation, enforceable anywhere before
   consumption, is the primary regulation applied by managers for many
   species to ensure against overfishing. Overfishing concerns arise
   primarily for those species where price is sufficiently high to
   encourage illegal fishing or where harvest by fishers is not easily
   monitored or controlled because of the nature of the fishing activity or
   because only part of the animal (e.g., the flesh) is harvested.
   Instances of overfishing by cause are discussed, and examples are
   presented to demonstrate how managers are dealing with or have dealt
   with different situations.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of the bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) was investigated in
   two boreal forest types (moderately dry pine heath forest, EM, and mesic
   spruce heath forest, HM) after being clipped at ground level in July,
   August or September 1985. The treatments simulated herbivory damage
   caused by small rodents. The emergence and growth of new ramets was
   monitored for five growing seasons. Regrowth during the same season
   occurred after clipping in July, but the survival of these ramets was
   low, especially in the HM forest. The two later clipping times prevented
   current-year regrowth, but allowed new shoots to emerge in the following
   years. Calculated as a percentage of the original value, the biomass
   that had accumulated by 1989 was greater in the HM forest than in the EM
   forest. In the EM forest, the density and the biomass reached the
   control level in the plots clipped in July, growth decreasing as the
   time of clipping became later. In the HM forest, the control level was
   reached in the plots clipped in August and September. No clear pattern
   of ramet growth was observed to be caused by the different treatments.
   Ramet size was slightly reduced in the plots clipped in September in the
   HM forest, possibly owing to the great density. The ramets were smaller
   in the EM forest, but the percentage ratio of leaf biomass to total
   biomass was somewhat greater than in the HM forest. The results
   suggested that the ability of the bilberry to recover completely from
   severe herbivory between the years of peak rodent populations depends
   both on the timing of the damage and on the growing site.}},

Abstract = {{Based on 30239 records from several questionnaires and field censuses in
   1980-1992 distribution maps were drawn for the amphibian and reptile
   species of Finland. Populations of the great crested newt (Triturus
   cristatus), smooth newt (T. vulgaris), slow worm (Anguis fragilis) and
   smooth snake (Coronella austriaca) were found outside the ranges where
   they were recorded in a corresponding survey of 1960-79. These
   recoveries were attributed to a more accurate recording of the species
   in the field and not to recent dispersal jumps. No considerable changes
   in the ranges of the common frog (Rana temporaria), moor frog (R.
   arvalis), common toad (Bufo bufo), common lizard (Lacerta vivipara),
   slow worm (Anguis fragilis), grass snake (Natrix natrix) and adder
   (Vipera berus) were observed in comparison with the ranges they occupied
   in 1960-79. The marsh frog (Rana ridibunda), recorded in Finland for the
   last time in 1960, was not found during the period of 1980-1992, either.
   The mean abundances of V. berus, N. natrix and A. fragilis were lower
   now in 50\% or more of the biological provinces monitored in 1960-79. In
   the other species, the mean abundances were the same as in the
   preceeding monitoring survey. The trends reported for local herptile
   populations in 1980-92 imply that V. berus, N. natrix, A. fragilis and T
   vulgaris have decreased more often than the other species. For none of
   the species did the reports indicating a population increase exceed 30\%
   of all the reports with trends for the same species.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between the diversity of invertebrate communities and
   the altitude of sampling sites were analysed in 438 benthic samples,
   collected between 1982 and 1991, in 56 rivers of western Switzerland.
   Diversity, estimated from total number of taxa (genus or family) and
   from number of taxa intolerant of pollution, was positively correlated
   with increasing altitude. In contrast, density of human population and
   the level of organic pollution were negatively correlated with
   increasing altitude. Therefore, the upstream increase of invertebrate
   diversity was attributed to the decrease of human population which is
   the main source of organic pollution. In this study, altitude was used,
   instead of organic pollution, to predict diversity. Empirical
   relationships between diversity and altitude were applied to surveys of
   water quality to describe the general altitudinal pattern characteristic
   for each region and to single out anomalous sites and rivers. In
   addition, changes in the altitudinal patterns of diversity can be used
   to monitor the recovery of rivers from pollution.}},

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1993}},

Abstract = {{Israeli contributions to the development of monitoring and mating
   suppression systems for cotton pests via the use of sex pheromones are
   described. These include identification of pheromones, development of
   dispensers and traps, assessment of pheromone traps as a monitoring
   device, and the use of pheromones for mating disruption. In Spodoptera
   littoralis, the minor component, Z9,E12-14:AC, in addition to the major
   component, Z9,E11-14:Ac, was found to be essential for attracting males.
   The pheromonal components of Helicoverpa armigera were identified and
   only two, Z11-1 6:Ald and Z9-16:Ald, were found to be of importance for
   attracting males. In Heliothis peltigera two major pheromonal
   components, Z11-16:Ald and Z9-14:Ald, were identified and a
   species-specific lure was developed. Two essential components,
   E10,E12-16:Ald and Z11-16:Ald, were detected in Earias insulana and
   proved to be effective in the field. The importance of the dispenser for
   attracting males was investigated. The efficiency of an Israeli septa
   was greater than that of other septa presently in use in the U.S.A for
   attracting H. zea or H. virescens. It was also shown that a more
   suitable dispenser enables the use of a smaller and easier to handle
   trap. Different types of traps used in Israel over the years are
   described. The modern funnel traps that are in wide use today throughout
   the world have almost the same design as the funnel traps developed in
   Israel long ago. Generally, there is a positive relation between
   captures of males in traps and the actual population in the field.
   However, peak capture of males in traps is somewhat delayed as compared
   with the peak of females in the field, and corresponds more to the egg
   peak. Trials carried out in Israel to test a hand-applied polymeric
   aerosol formulation containing the major sex pheromone component of S.
   littoralis gave very promising results. Satisfactory mating disruption
   by hand application of ShinEtsu ropes was obtained for Pectinophora
   gossypiella and H. armigera. The pink bollworm P. gossypiella is
   commercially controlled today in Israel by NoMate or ShinEtsu ropes.
   Twist-tie formulations for combined mating disruption of both pink
   bollworm and E. insulana are also being tested.}},

Abstract = {{The declining population of monk seals on the Ionian islands of
   Kefalonia, Ithaca, and Lefkada, Greece, was studied from July 1986 to
   April 1988. The study included (1) individual identification, (2) number
   of sightings, (3) use of caves, (4) damage to fishing gear, and (5)
   deaths. Three hundred and ninety-seven sightings of about 18 seals
   (including eight pups) were recorded Maximum sightings occurred in
   June/July 1987; most sightings were of solitary animals. Twenty of 126
   surveyed caves (16\%) were used by seals. There were preferences for
   specific caves. There was no evidence of a diurnal pattern of cave use.
   Fishing trips near the study sites were monitored, and 136 of 1864
   (7.3\%) reported damage by seals to fishing gear. Significant
   correlations were found between sightings, cave use, and damage to
   fishing gear and/or catch. In an experiment we demonstrate that one seal
   may cause considerable damage in one night. Mortality data of 25 years
   show that most of 34 reported deaths were caused by deliberate killing
   (62\%) and accidents in fishing gear (24\%). Suggested measures for
   mitigating the decline of monk seals include (1) establishing protection
   zones, (2) compensating fishermen for losses, and (3) expanding public
   awareness programmes.}},

Abstract = {{The south-west of Australia is a very old weather landscape with an
   extremely rich flora. The high degree of heterogeneity in the vegetation
   resulted in an extremely patchy distribution of vegetation types.
   Clearing for agriculture has been recent (i.e. within the last 150
   years), extensive and rapid. This change in distribution and abundance
   of vegetation, together with the effects of species introduced during
   settlement by Europeans over the last 160 years, has had a major impact
   on the distribution and abundance of birds.
   This paper describes a community-based bird atlassing scheme used to
   establish the present distribution an abundance of birds in the
   wheatbelt region of Western Australia. The results of this scheme are
   compared with historical records to examine the changes in distribution
   and abundance of species in the wheatbelt in order to establish the
   effects that changing land-use has had on native birds. One hundred and
   nine species of non-passerines have been recorded from the wheatbelt and
   34 (31\%) have decreased in range and/or abundance and 9 (8\%) have
   increased, only two of these species occurred in the wheatbelt prior to
   the clearing of native vegetation. The passerines have been affected
   more by changing land use with 62 (75\%) species decreasing in range
   and/or abundance and no species increasing.
   The need to obtain more data on population dynamics, movement patterns
   and resource use Of native birds, particularly those of conservation
   significance, is pointed out, as is the need to involve the human
   community in the collection of data and the monitoring of the native
   biota. The methods described in this paper using observers scattered
   throughout the wheatbelt of Western Australia have wide application in
   assessing the distribution and abundance of birds and other organisms in
   many other areas.}},

Abstract = {{Feral pig Sus scrofa control in Kipahulu Valley, a remote rain forest in

   reached 96/km2 and 200/km2 for the two management units by the end of
   the study. A mean effort of 43 worker hours/pig was used to remove 53
   pigs from the upper management unit, and a mean of 7 worker hours/pig to
   remove 175 animals from the more densely populated lower unit. Pig
   activity monitoring along transects provided a good measure of control
   effectiveness until densities of about 1 pig/km2 were achieved, after
   which transects became less useful than scouting for determining pig

Journal = {{COLONIAL WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Abstract = {{As many as 6000 Silver Gulls (Larus novaehollandiae) per hour were
   recorded leaving a landfill near Wollongong, Australia during the
   breeding season. The numbers of gulls that entered and left this site
   varied seasonally, with a minimum recorded in the non-breeding season.
   In two breeding seasons, from September 1988 to January 1991, 74\% and
   62\% of wing-tagged, breeding gulls visited the landfill from an island
   breeding colony 12 km away. Gulls visited the depot on approximately
   half the number of days monitored. Within a day, most individuals (62\%
   of marked birds observed) visited the depot only once, although some
   individuals visited up to four times. The average duration of visits was
   1 h. These data suggest a high turnover of gulls at the landfill. Over
   two breeding seasons, 85\% of regurgitations from Silver Gulls trapped
   at nests contained only human refuse, 13\% only natural food, and 2\% a
   mixture of both. Meat comprised 63\% of the human refuse and the rest
   consisted of a variety of other (mainly starchy) items. The data suggest
   either that gulls gorged themselves quickly at the landfill site or that
   a considerable amount of refuse was obtained away from the landfill site
   under investigation. The proportion of the population feeding on natural
   food changed from 5\% to 25\% through the breeding season, paralleling
   changes in the number of young chicks in the colony and the density of
   the breeding population. The highest proportion of natural food in
   regurgitates was consistently recorded early in the breeding season
   (September) when the first eggs of the season had hatched. These early
   eggs produced most of the fledged chicks for the breeding season.}},

Abstract = {{The nesting biology, diet, and mortality of Pigeon Guillemots (Cepphus
   columba) and the effects of predation on them was investigated in
   Skidegate Inlet in the Queen Charlotte Islands. Their nesting population
   was estimated at 1000 - 1100 pairs. Pigeon Guillemots were first seen on
   their colonies on April 12; their mean laying and hatching dates fell on
   June 14 +/- 12.3 and July 14 +/- 11.5, respectively, and fledging peaked
   in the last week of August in 1991. The average clutch size was 1.58 +/-
   0.30 eggs; egg length and volume increased over the season. The
   reproductive success of Pigeon Guillemots in Skidegate Inlet was low
   (0.41 fledglings/pair) compared to other regions, due largely to
   predation. Major predators were Northwestern Crows (Corvus caurinus) and
   raccoons (Procyon lotor), an introduced species. Food shortage could
   also have been a factor in the low success, as younger chicks in
   two-chick broods had significantly lower weights and higher mortality
   than older siblings and single-raised chicks. Food brought to Pigeon
   Guillemot chicks consisted of epibenthic fishes, mostly gunnels
   (Pholidae) and pricklebacks (Stichaeidae). It is recommended that Pigeon
   Guillemot attendance at colonies in the Queen Charlotte Islands be
   monitored and the effects of raccoon predation on their reproductive
   success be further investigated.}},

Title = {{COLONIAL WATERBIRDS AS BIOINDICATORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE}},
Journal = {{COLONIAL WATERBIRDS}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{223-251}},
Abstract = {{As ecosystems become increasingly affected by human activity, the need
   to monitor, evaluate, manage, and remediate ecological change will
   increase. Because of the complexity of ecosystems, it is likely that the
   use of biological indicators (bioindicators) will similarly increase.
   This paper reviews the potential utility of using aspects of colonial
   waterbird biology as indicators of environmental change in their
   supporting ecosystems. Characteristics of colonial waterbirds that
   support their use in bioindication include aspects of their basic
   biology, the extent of biological understanding of that biology, human
   interest, and historical precedent.
   The justification for using biological indicators to understand
   ecosystem level human impacts has theoretical underpinnings in systems
   theory, ecosystem theory, and hierarchy theory. Bioindicators may be
   derived from any level of biological organization. Two levels of
   indicators, suborganismal bioindicators (biomarkers, biochemical
   indicators) and population/community/ecosystem indicators, each have
   distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Traditionally, bioindicators
   derived from colonial waterbirds have included contaminant burden and
   population numbers. However, certain suborganismal bioindicators also
   seem appropriate for development within this group of birds.
   Difficulties in using colonial waterbirds as indicators include their
   large size, wide ranging habits, difficulty of approach and capture, and
   migratory patterns.
   Potentially appropriate colonial waterbird bioindicators include
   genotoxicity, mixed function oxidases, metallothionein induction, tissue
   concentration of contaminants, egg shell quality, other physiological
   responses, histopathology and teratology, growth, behavior, reproductive
   performance, mortality, presence/absence, distribution, and population
   indices. Several of these potential bioindicators may be used during the
   nesting period when the adults, eggs, and young are concentrated at
   specific colony sites. At this time, chicks and eggs can be effectively
   sampled and adults are often concentrated at foraging sites. The use of
   multiple indicators during nesting, especially those related to
   population indices, hematology, contaminant burdens, and reproductive
   competency, have special promise.}},

Abstract = {{The spring dispersal of Sitona lineatus L. (Coleoptera; Curculionidae)
   was investigated on a Danish farm. S. lineatus dispersed by flight in
   the early spring on sunny, calm days with temperatures above ca.
   15-degrees-C.
   Two thirds of the population of S. lineatus dispersed from perennial
   leguminous crops (clover and lucerne) in the first period of flight
   activity. The next dispersal did not occur until one month later despite
   several intermediate flight activity periods. The first period of
   dispersal occurred before the germination of the spring sown summer host
   crop, Vicia faba L. The field bean crop was infested in three later
   invasions during a period of more than three weeks.
   The aggregation pheromone, 4-methyl-3,5-heptanedione, had a significant
   effect on captures of both males and females in cone traps placed on the
   ground. There was no effect of the pheromone on captures in yellow
   sticky traps placed 1.5 m above ground. The pheromone effect is
   discussed in relation to behavioural observations.
   Both types of traps may be used in a survey system for monitoring spring
   dispersal of S. lineatus and optimal timing of insecticide spraying.
   However, the pheromone cone traps were highly specific whereas all kinds
   of flying insects were caught in the yellow sticky traps, thus making
   the latter traps less suitable for monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Pupal parasitism of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), was monitored
   in 15 study plots in New Jersey from 1978 to 1988. The predominant
   parasitoid was a chalcidid wasp, Brachymeria intermedia (Nees), which
   was found in only six plots. Parasitism was generally observed in the
   year of or preceding the peak numbers of gypsy moth egg masses.
   Parasitism exceeded 4 \% in only one plot. Percentage parasitism was
   correlated significantly with numbers of egg masses per hectare in the
   current season and with numbers of pupae per plot in the previous
   season, suggesting delayed density dependence. A multiple regression
   analysis found percentage parasitism to be correlated significantly with
   percentage infection by nuclear polyhedrosis virus, density of male host
   pupae, and mean minimum temperature in August and March. A canonical
   discriminant analysis carried out to distinguish study plots with and
   without the parasitoid was significant. Plots with B. intermedia had
   relatively higher host populations and defoliation.}},

Abstract = {{Change in chromosome number, numerical aneuploidy, has been consistently
   linked with cancer development. Since 90\% of cancers arise in
   epithelial tissues, techniques that measure aneuploidy in these tissues
   would be very useful. Here we describe methods of optimization and
   suggest use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect
   aneuploidy in exfoliated epithelial cells collected from the mouth and
   bladder. A total of 10,383 urothelial cells and 4,691 buccal cells were
   scored in order to determine a baseline frequency of aneuploidy in human
   volunteers using a classical satellite probe for chromosome 9. Protein
   digestion with pepsin was found to be more efficient at removing the
   keratinized cell membrane and optimizing probe penetration than acid
   washes, detergent washes, or hypotonic treatments. A 20 min cellular
   digestion with 200 mug/ml and a 30 min digestion with 300 mug/ml of
   pepsin in 0.01 M HCl optimized probe penetration in urothelial and
   buccal cells, respectively. Average frequencies for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4
   hybridization regions were 10.3, 10.1, 78.4, 1.0, and 0.3\% for
   urothelial cells and 8.8, 9.8, 79.4, 1.3, and 0.3\% for buccal cells,
   respectively. These results are very similar to those previously
   described in lymphocytes. The urothelial cells of males had a lower
   frequency of diploid cells and a higher frequency of cells without
   hybridization regions than females (P < 0.02). No statistically
   significant variability was found between individuals or sex groups in
   buccal cells. Our data show that FISH is a useful tool to detect changes
   in frequency of aneuploidy in exfoliated epithelial cells and has good
   potential for monitoring human populations exposed to genotoxic agents.

   reduce genetic diversity, in populations and thus increase the

Abstract = {{Residue levels of organochlorine pesticides (HEOD, DDE), polychlorinated

   species were monitored in Britain over a 28-year (1963-90) period. Of
   two raptor species, sparrowhawks contained higher levels of most
   chemicals than did kestrels. Among three fish-eaters, herons and
   kingfishers contained the highest levels of DDE and HEOD, while herons
   and great-crested grebes contained the highest levels of PCBs and
   mercury. Species differences were related partly to diet and habitat. In
   sparrowhawks and kestrels, residues of HEOD and DDE were higher in
   eastern, arable districts than elsewhere, especially in the 1960s and
   1970s. In the fish-eaters, similar regional differences in residue
   levels were apparent in herons, especially in the 1970s, but not in the
   other species, for which samples were smaller. Over the 28 years, most
   species showed significant downward trends in HEOD, DDE and Hg levels,
   but only two fish-eaters showed significant declines in PCB levels. The
   downward trends in DDE and HEOD followed successive restrictions in the
   use of organochlorine pesticides, and were accompanied by recoveries in
   the populations and breeding success of affected species. Downward
   trends in mercury were associated with reductions in both agricultural
   use and industrial emissions.}},

Abstract = {{A visual growth score method was used to monitor the growth performance
   of 24 populations of white clover (Trifolium repens) over a three year
   period. The mean growth scores for each year were used as population x
   year data for cluster analyses. Cluster analysis methods based on a
   regression model where genotypes were grouped for similarity of both
   intercepts and slopes (Method 1) or slopes only (Method 2), were able to
   differentiate the persistent populations from those that showed a yield
   decline over time. The deviations from regression mean square was used
   as an indication of stability. Method 1 was able to cluster the high
   yielding persistent populations into a separate cluster, thus
   facilitating the selection of desirable populations. Deviations from
   regression identified the stable populations from the cluster. In
   combination with the simple growth score system, this analytical method
   is a powerful tool for evaluating a large number of breeding families of
   perennial pasture clovers and grasses for yield and persistence.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of both body weight and population-habitat system
   (represented by the study areas) on reproductive performance of young
   wild boar females was studied from the examination of 638 individuals

   reproductive stage of wild boar females strongly affected the body
   weight but not interaction between these two factors was highlighted.
   Body weight increased from non-reproductive animals to pregnant ones in
   the five populations studied. Thus, a relationship between reproductive
   performance and body weight could be expected for any wild boar
   population. On the other hand, the parameters of this relationship
   showed a large variability according to population-habitat system. For a
   given body weight, the proportion of young wild boar females that bred
   have fluctuated a lot according to food resources.  Thus, breeding
   proportion for females belonging to a given body weight class could be
   viewed as a useful biological indicator for monitoring wild boar

Abstract = {{Evidence for the occurrence of mycotoxins in human and animal foods is
   examined. Surveillance of blood and milk samples has detected low levels
   of ochratoxin A in human populations and the presence of aflatoxin
   adducts in human tissues. Current legislation in the UK only addresses
   aflatoxin, and monitoring shows that, in general, incidence of
   aflatoxins at levels above legal or guideline levels is low. In recent
   years, problems in susceptible products such as figs, peanuts and maize
   have been identified and largely controlled. However, the role of many
   currently little studied or unknown mycotoxins remains unclear. The
   presence of a group of mycotoxins called fumonisins, first reported in
   1988 as occurring in maize, has caused considerable concern world-wide.
   Studies at the Central Science Laboratory of the Ministry of
   Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have investigated the natural occurrence
   of mycotoxins and the associated fungi. A survey of the pre-harvest
   formation in cereals of very stable mycotoxins, such as the
   trichothecenes, emphasised potential difficulties in controlling
   mycotoxins produced by field fungi. Although much research has been
   carried out since the original discovery of aflatoxin, the significance
   of mycotoxins for human and animal health in the UK still remains a
   matter for conjecture.}},

Abstract = {{The False Pink Bollworm, Sathrobota (Pyroderces) simplex (Walsingham),
   was observed infesting open cotton bolls during the 1987/88 cotton
   growing season in the Punjab region of Pakistan. The larvae were, at
   that time, incorrectly identified as Pink Bollworm (PBW), Pectinophora
   gossypiella (Saunders). Their presence caused concern, as the area of
   infestation occurred in a field of cotton which had been treated with
   pheromone (gossyplure) to control infestation by P. gossypiella.
   Subsequently identification of the adults in the UK revealed that the
   majority of the infested bolls contained S. simplex and this was
   confirmed in trials conducted in the same area during the 1988/89 cotton
   growing season. This is the first record of S. simplex in Pakistan. The
   importance of S. simplex as a pest of cotton, and the evaluation of a
   pheromone formulation for monitoring adult populations, is described.
   Its significance as a pest of cotton is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal (annual) and spatial fluctuations of soft-bottom invertebrates
   from 1977 to 1988 were reviewed and analyzed from an ocean outfall area
   on the San Pedro Shelf, California. Several dominant species which
   occurred throughout the monitoring period provide continuity between
   early sampling efforts and recent ones. Annual fluctuations in the mean
   number of species, abundance, diversity and biomass were generally
   conservative compared to spatial fluctuations. Temporal changes of note
   include a marked reduction in abundance and biomass between 1981 and
   1984 and another decline in biomass in 1988. The former was associated
   with conditions of the 1982-1983 El Nino, and the latter with a shift in
   population dominance from a bivalve to a polychaete.
   Mean abundance and biomass were enhanced by the outfall without a
   significant reduction in number of species. The response of the biota to
   the outfall extended further upcoast (northwest) than downcoast.
   Several hypotheses were posed and briefly examined. These include the
   effects of total suspended solids generated from the outfall, and the
   role of the `'Three Little Pigs'' (bivalve-Parvilucina tenuisculpta
   CARPENTER, ostracod-Euphilomedes carcharodonta (SMITH),
   polychaete-Capitella capitata (FABRICIUS)) in influencing benthic
   community structure. Finally, measures of infauna from the San Pedro
   Shelf were, except for abundance, very similar to those reported from
   other California shelf areas. Through time and space the outfall has had
   limited negative effect on infaunal community structure.}},

Abstract = {{1. From two enclosed populations monitored for 13 and 11 years, time-
   and age-specific survival rates of roe deer were estimated in relation
   to age and study site by recent capture-mark-recapture methods.
   2. The two populations were very different. Roe deer in Trois Fontaines,
   a 1360 ha reserve in east France, faced severe winters. The size of this
   highly productive population was roughly constant during the study
   period. Conversely, in Chize, a 2660 ha reserve in west France with mild
   winters, roe deer showed density dependence in reproduction and body
   weight.
   3. As a general rule, females survived better than males, the survival
   rates of prime-age adults were the highest, and survival decreased after
   7 years of age. Only the severe winters affected markedly the
   survivorship of roe deer.
   4. In Chize only, juveniles survived markedly less well than prime-age
   adults. Since physical maturity was reached later in Chize than in Trois
   Fontaines, the length of the critical stage for survival may be
   sensitive to population dynamics. Therefore, as in other ungulates, the
   survival of juvenile roe deer appears to be very sensitive to external
   influences.
   5. Despite marked differences between the two populations studied, the
   survival rates of prime-age adults were similar in Trois Fontaines and
   Chize. Thus, the survival of prime-age adult roe deer appears to be
   relatively insensitive to external influences.
   6. The difference in survival between sexes for prime-age adults was
   close to values observed in dimorphic and polygynous ungulates. However,
   roe deer only exhibit a marginal sexual dimorphism in size, a small
   breeding group size and no sex differences in fawn mortality. Therefore,
   costs of sexual selection cannot account for this gender effect in roe
   deer, and changes in social interactions between females in these
   high-density populations could be involved.
   7. The decline of survival after 7 years of age was probably related to
   tooth wear.}},

Abstract = {{1. The blackfly Simulium posticatum causes a severe biting problem in
   the valley of the river Stour in Dorset, UK. Various control measures
   have been attempted including egg removal and weed cutting to remove
   associated larvae. 2. Following a small-scale trial of the larvicide
   Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) in a side-stream of the
   Stour during 1989, permission was obtained to treat four sites on the
   main river between Blandford and Wimborne in 1991. 3. The effect of Bti
   treatment was monitored at sites up to 1300 m downstream of the
   application points. Mortality of S. posticatum was between 82\% and 98\%
   except for the site 1300 m downstream of Blandford where the kill was
   68\%. 4. Extensive sampling of Chironomidae and other benthic
   invertebrates over a period of 84 days failed to show any effect of
   treatment on non-target organisms. 5. Diurnal drift sampling was
   undertaken to assess any possible change in behaviour of invertebrates
   and to sample any dead animals in the water body. Again, no effect was
   found with the exception of dead larvae of S. posticatum within 1 day of
   treatment. 6. By careful monitoring of simuliid populations it was
   possible to treat the river when only S. posticatum larvae were present,
   between winter and summer generations of other species.}},

Abstract = {{A glass vial monitoring technique was developed to test for permethrin
   resistance in soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker), adults.
   Male and female moths from laboratory permethrin-resistant and
   -susceptible soybean looper strains were exposed to permethrin residues
   in glass vials to estimate concentration-mortality lines. Probit
   analysis of results indicated that male and female LC50 values were not
   significantly different within each strain. The resistant male and
   female moths were 13.4 and 12.2-fold more tolerant of permethrin,
   respectively, when compared to the same sex from the susceptible strain.
   A discriminating concentration of 2.5 mug permethrin per vial was
   identified for detection of permethrin resistance in soybean looper
   adults. Male soybean looper moths were captured during the 1991 growing

Abstract = {{Anaerobically digested sewage sludge is currently applied to farmland
   surrounding Tucson, Arizona to supply nutrients for the growth of
   cotton. Bacterial pathogens introduced into the environment by this
   practice may survive or move through the soil profile thus posing health
   risks to animals and humans. We have conducted both laboratory and field
   studies to monitor the survival and transport of bacterial pathogens
   added to soil via sludge. In laboratory studies, sewage sludge was added
   to soil and incubated at constant moisture and temperature conditions.
   Populations of fecal streptococci, fecal coliforms and total coliforms
   were monitored at weekly intervals using the Most Probable Number (MPN)
   method. Two soils and 3 temperatures were evaluated. Field studies
   determined the survival of indicator organisms in the surface horizon,
   and survival and transport of fecal coliforms up to a depth of 300 cm.
   We found that soil moisture, texture and temperature all affected the
   persistence of bacterial pathogens in sludge amended soil. Survival of
   organisms increased with increasing soil moisture and clay content, and
   with decreased soil temperatures. In the field, when soil moisture
   content increased after rainfall events, regrowth of indicator organisms
   occurred. Soil acted as an efficient filter negating bacterial
   transport, and thus fecal coliforms did not appear to migrate through
   the soil profile under non-irrigated conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of surface deposit-feeder (Macoma balthica L.) density on
   chlorophyll a concentrations in shallow (2.5-3.5 cm deep) sediment
   microcosms was examined. The experimental design simulated subtidal,
   unilluminated sediments without benthic algal primary production, where
   sedimentary chlorophyll a is not necessarily within viable algal cells.
   Changes in depth of the visual Redox Potential Discontinuity (RPD),
   fluorometrically-determined levels of chlorophyll a and phaeopigments
   and bivalve condition were monitored at weekly intervals for 42 days.
   Sampling was conducted by multiple coring in replicate containers at 4
   Macoma densities (0, 370, 741 and 1111 individuals . m-2 ). Cores were
   sectioned vertically before analysis. Bivalve density had no effect on
   the depth of the visual RPD. M. balthica had no persistent effect on
   sedimentary chlorophyll a levels at natural bivalve field densities.
   Evidence that bivalves were either not using chlorophyll a-containing
   particles as a primary food source, or the absorption efficiency of
   chlorophyll a by the bivalves was low includes: (1) chlorophyll a
   concentrations did not decline specifically within the surface feeding
   area, (2) phaeopigment concentrations were not elevated, and (3) bivalve
   condition was affected negatively in some treatments without a
   corresponding change in chlorophyll a concentrations. In benthic
   habitats lacking primary production, where chlorophyll a input depends
   upon sedimentation, abundant, surface deposit-feeding bivalves, such as
   M. balthica, may have little influence on sedimentary chlorophyll a
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A marine monitoring programme was established by the UK Nature
   Conservancy Council in 1984 at the Lundy and Isles of Scilly proposed
   marine nature reserves in southwest England to help determine their
   management requirements. The aim was to provide information on important
   marine habitats, long-term changes in community structure and the life
   history (particularly longevity and growth rates) and ecology of species
   of high nature conservation interest. The benthic studies mainly
   concentrated on communities of Mediterranean-Atlantic species which are
   at or near the northern limits of their distribution in the study sites.
   Many of the species and communities studied are very stable, long-lived
   and slow recruiting. They are, therefore, also vulnerable to damage.
   Southern species of cup corals were found to grow slowly and reproduce
   very infrequently, with populations showing a general decline during the
   study period. Species of sponges and southern soft corals also typically
   displayed very slow growth. Periods of above or below average sea water
   temperature are considered to be particularly important factors
   affecting the persistence of Mediterranean-Atlantic species, with higher
   temperatures linked with recruitment events in scleractinians and
   unusually cold temperatures appearing to stop growth or even cause
   contraction in colony size or death in some species, such as certain
   sponges. The results illustrate the importance of abnormal climate years
   on species at the geographical limits of their distribution.
   The extreme stability of these communities of high nature conservation
   interest has implications for reserve management. Because of their poor
   capacity for recovery, long-lived and slowly recruiting
   Mediterranean-Atlantic species are considered to be particularly
   vulnerable to minor and infrequent damage, which might readily be
   overlooked in other communities, as well as to more major and widespread
   damaging events. Monitoring at Lundy and the Isles of Scilly will act as
   important control sites for monitoring work in the marine environment
   elsewhere around Britain.}},

Abstract = {{Fixed position linear transects were established in early 1989 at Buck
   Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. On
   September 17-18 of that year Hurricane Hugo, the most severe cyclone to
   impact the area in over 60 years, passed directly over the island
   bringing hurricane-force winds for over 12 h and maximum estimated wind
   speeds of 70 m . s-1 (160 mph). Despite the severity of the storm,
   damage to coral reefs was extremely localised and concentrated mainly on
   reefs open to its southeasterly direction of approach. The southeast
   reef front at Buck Island was razed to substrate level between the
   surface and 7 m depth and the reef crest behind it was smothered in a 1
   m deep berm of broken coral rubble. At a site on the north backreef,
   however, only a slight loss of coral cover was detected which was more
   than compensated for during 1990-91. At a south reef site which was in
   8-10 m depth, just outside the region of severe damage, coral cover was
   reduced by 40-46\% on three out of four transects. Shifts in community
   structure were detected by multi-dimensional scaling of Bray-Curtis
   similarity measures and by k-dominance curves, but not by the Shannon
   diversity statistic (H'). Coral cover had returned to approximate
   pre-hurricane levels by June 1991, but community composition remained
   distinct. One of the four transects at this south site was apparently
   not significantly damaged during the hurricane. Such spatial variability
   may affect recovery rates, since pockets of relatively undisturbed
   benthos may provide seed populations for recruitment into adjacent, more
   severely damaged areas. Hurricane Hugo did not appear to cause an
   immediate increase in species diversity by differential mortality of the
   dominant species in the community. This result is consistent with
   previous studies of the impact of less severe storms on St. Croix. but
   contrary to several reports of hurricane impact in other areas.}},

Abstract = {{The habitat choice of the recruits of Concholepas concholepas Brugiere
   (Mollusca; Gastropoda; Muricidae) was studied during the recruitment
   seasons of 1989 and 1991. From June to December 1989, the new cohort was
   monitored measuring individual size, type of microhabitat utilized and
   density, using 45 permanent plots scattered on the rocks of the Marine
   Reserve of Mehuin, at three tidal levels (high, mid and low intertidal).
   The low tide fringe of the surf zone was found to be the main settlement
   habitat. In such environmental conditions, the post-settled individuals
   are associated with a number of sea anemone species, remaining attached
   to the base of their columns from June to August. An anemone removal
   experiment conducted during the recruitment season of 1991, showed that
   this association did not have significant influence on the density of
   recruits. In September 1989, the mean size of the individuals reached 8
   mm of peristomatic length; then, the young recruits began to move from
   low intertidal and submerged habitats towards the emergent
   mid-intertidal habitats and also into the high intertidal in rocks
   subject to high levels of wave exposure. These movements were tested
   during the 1991 season using 500 marked individuals released in the low
   intertidal; we observed some of the marked individuals living in the mid
   and high intertidal during the summer, in spite of the recapture rate
   being very low (4\% for the last observation). This displacement of the
   individuals into different habitats, explains why in previous studies
   recruitment in southern Chile was detected mainly in August to December
   in the mid-intertidal, with individuals whose sizes were near to 10 mm
   of peristomatic length.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of predation by a sea star, Henricia sanguinolenta (O. F.
   Muller), on finger sponges, Isodictya palmata (Lamarck) and Isodictya
   deichmannae (de Laubenfels), was investigated by monitoring populations
   of Isodictya spp. for 1.5 yr at two sites off northern Massachusetts,
   USA. H. sanguinolenta removed cells surrounding the spicule framework of
   the sponges, leaving distinct, nonpigmented areas easily recognized ag
   lesions. There was a significant correlation between sea star size (arm
   length and disc diameter) and the area of the resulting lesion. Lesions
   were most commonly found on the middle and upper third portions of
   fingers. The null hypothesis of no preference for location along the
   sponge finger was rejected. The greatest number of lesions occurred in
   the summer months, when H. sanguinolenta densities were highest. Only
   16\% of all monitored lesions (n = 227) recovered. There was a net loss
   of 0.924 g lesion tissue per year due to H. sanguinolenta predation,
   based on 10 monitored sponges, The location of damage by H.
   sanguinolenta affected the growth and mortality of Isodictya spp.
   Lesions on the horizontal portion or base of the sponge affected its
   spatial distribution, because these lesions caused the sponge to break
   up into smaller fragments that remained attached to the substratum. In
   addition, lesions along the sponge finger weakened the tissue and
   resulted in increased likelihood of breakage. The mean breaking stress
   of sponge fingers with lesions was two-fold lower than the mean breaking
   stress of fingers without lesions, indicating that sea star predation
   can eventually lead to tissue loss in storms or high wave action. Of the
   16 sponges followed for 1.5 yr at Shag Rocks, Massachusetts, seven
   showed positive growth, eight showed negative growth, and one increased
   then decreased in area. Growth of Isodictya spp. may be seasonal, as
   biomass values were greatest in the summer months. Many of the monitored
   sponges developed black necrotic areas which led to death of sponge
   tissue and weakened Isodictya spp. fingers. Subsequently, high wave
   action in the fall and winter months contributed to the loss of sponge
   tissue. There was a net loss of 104.8 g sponge biomass per year,
   representing 74.1\% of the original sponge biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton bloom development was examined in newly upwelled waters
   collected off the Cape Peninsula during active upwelling and incubated
   in the laboratory under conditions approximating those in the ocean, Of
   interest was the variability of the phytoplankton developmental
   processes following upwelling. Results were compared to those of drogue
   studies which shared the same objectives but utilized drogues to tag and
   follow parcels of upwelled water in order to monitor bloom development.
   Differences in the time required for bloom development and in the peak
   population size were attributed to differences in the duration of the
   lag period, in the size of the seed population, in grazing pressures and
   in the total amount of nutrient available in the source water. Bloom
   development was measured in terms of chlorophyll a, particle volume,
   phytoplankton species and phytoplankton carbon changes. Specific growth
   rates were initially low prior to the initiation of exponential growth
   during which maximum growth rates were recorded. Microflagellates were
   found to be capable of higher growth rates than diatoms. In terms of
   carbon the microflagellate fraction varied within narrow limits. The
   variation and peaks in the phytoplankton biomass were caused by the
   diatom fraction of the total carbon. Following the bloom peak, negative
   growth rates were attributed to cell death with the rapid autolysis of
   cell pigments. Changes in the nitrate, silicate and phytoplankton carbon
   concentrations relative to phosphate were similar to the ratios of
   Redfield et al. (1963). Growth of the bloom was terminated by either
   nitrate, silicate or phosphate limitation. Phytoplankton productivity
   was assessed in terms of changes in phytoplankton carbon, nitrate
   concentration and C-14 uptake Based on the results of the microcosm
   studies simple equations were formulated for the prediction of
   phytoplankton growth in terms of chlorophyll a following upwelling.
   Predicted maximum chlorophyll a yield and duration of growth are
   compared to observed chlorophyll a concentrations during the drogue
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to high levels of particulate matter is one of the risks
   associated with a household utilizing low quality coal as primary
   household energy source. In South Africa more than 20 million people
   rely on traditional (wood) and transitional (coal and paraffin) fuels to
   fulfil their basic energy needs - cooking and space heating. Personal
   exposures to TSP in a coal burning Township in the Vaal Triangle
   (central South Africa) were determined during the winter and summer of
   1991 and 1992. Personal monitoring of TSP were conducted over a 12 hour
   period. Forty five children, age 8 - 12, participated. Exposures varied
   from 294 to 2304 mug/m3. The average 12 hour exposure during a summer
   day (8:30 a.m. - 8.30 p.m.) was 662 mug/m3 (N = 15) compared to 1333
   mug/m3 for a winter school day (N = 13). The difference was highly
   significant (P < 0.0002). The study identified the following risk
   factors associated with exposure: season (winter higher than summer),
   gender (boys higher than girls), and day of the week (school days
   higher: schools are situated in the centre of completely unelectrified
   areas). Statistical significant difference between personal exposures to
   TSP were documented between electrified vs unelectrified (utilize coal
   only) areas. The study confirmed other reports of extremely high
   exposures to air pollution documented in developing communities across
   the globe.}},

Abstract = {{A health assessment was performed in a recently opened landfill for
   toxic waste. The site has received 14,000 tons of hazardous waste,
   confined in drums or deposited as bulk material, which were left
   outdoors for seven months. The analysis in some samples showed that the
   waste is rich in heavy metals, however we did not find high levels of
   contaminates in air or surface soil in different areas on-site. When
   compared to a control group, high-risk workers show higher levels of
   arsenic in urine and hair, and non-specific symptoms (irritability and
   insomnia). But among groups, we did not find statistical differences in
   urinary mercury, blood lead, phenol in urine, cadmium in hair or blood,
   sister chromatid exchange values, lymphocytes proliferation kinetics,
   liver function tests, and other non-specific symptoms. We considered
   this project as a background study for human exposure to hazardous
   waste, providing useful results for the future evaluation of chronic
   effects in the same population.}},

Abstract = {{MIL-STD-1246B states that naturally occurring particulate contamination
   on surfaces follows a lognormal distribution with a geometric mean of 1
   micron. Thus, when the logarithm of cumulative particle count is plotted
   against the square of the logarithm of particle size, an approximate
   straight line should result. However, deviations from this `'natural''
   behavior have been observed in many manufacturing environments involving
   specialized machining or cleaning. Complex disk drive components, such
   as machined castings or ground surfaces, must be inspected by first
   extracting contaminants into a fluid by some means (e.g.,
   ultrasonically, or with a pressurized spray), and then monitoring the
   particle population in the fluid. The cleaning method and the extraction
   method, in particular, can cause a significant departure from the
   lognormal approximation. The substrate material also influences the
   extent of this departure, as does its cleanliness level. These aspects
   are brought out by the plotting of actual particle size distributions
   obtained by extracting particles from substrates that are cleaned using
   a variety of methods. These are compared against the MIL-STD-1246
   distribution. Conclusions are drawn regarding the effects of the
   cleaning process and the measurement procedure on the applicability of
   the MIL-STD distribution for various substrates. Implications of these
   conclusions for the derivation of particulate cleanliness specifications
   and for modifying MIL-STD-1246B are pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{Eggs, blood, and carcasses of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and
   fish were collected and breeding success of eagles was monitored in the
   Columbia River estuary, 1980-87, to determine if contaminants were
   having an effect on productivity. High levels of dichloro diphenyl
   dichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), and
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) were found in eggs, blood
   from adults, and 2 eagle carcasses. Detectable levels of DDE and PCB's
   were found in blood of nestlings indicating they were exposed to these
   contaminants early in life. Increasing concentrations of DDE and PCB's
   with age also indicated accumulation of these contaminants. Adult eagles
   also had higher levels of mercury (Hg) in blood than subadults or young
   indicating accumulation with age. The high levels of DDE and PCB's were
   associated with eggshell thinning (xBAR = 10\%) and with productivity
   (xBAR = 0.56 young/occupied site) that was lower than that of healthy
   populations (i.e., greater-than-or-equal-to 1.00 young/occupied site).
   DDE and PCB's had a deleterious effect on reproduction of bald eagles in
   the estuary. The role dioxins play in eagle reproduction remains
   unclear, but concentrations in eagle eggs were similar to those in
   laboratory studies on other species where dioxins adversely affected
   hatchability of eggs. Probable sources of these contaminants include
   dredged river sediments and hydroelectric dams, and the proper
   management of each may reduce the amount of contaminants released into
   the Columbia River estuary.}},

Abstract = {{We broadcast vocalizations of pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps),
   American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), least bittern (Ixobrychus
   exilis), Virginia rail (Rallus limicola), and sora (Porzana carolina) to
   derive a standardized method to monitor breeding populations of these
   secretive waterbirds. Broadcast of tape-recorded calls at 60 wetlands in
   Maine improved species detectability by 93-1, 320\% over passive
   observation. Detection rates at wetlands where target species were known
   to occur ranged between 0.56 (least bittern) and 0.86 (pied-billed
   grebe) per survey visit, Three visits to a wetland were adequate to
   determine the presence or absence of all species with 90\% certainty.
   Least bitterns, soras, and Virginia rails were detected primarily within
   50 m of observers; pied-billed grebes and American bitterns were
   detected up to 500 m distant. Most responses were aural. Responsiveness
   of each species varied nonsystematically in relation to seasonal
   chronology, time of day, wind, precipitation, and cloud cover. Single,
   annual surveys at a stratified random sample of wetlands (i.e.,
   waterbird `'miniroutes'') can generate sufficient encounter rates for
   these species to monitor population trends.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored European lynx (Lynx lynx) in a reintroduced population in
   the Swiss Alps from 1983 to 1988. We predicted that recolonizing lynx
   initially would reach a higher population density (and would kill more
   ungulates) than they would sustain once the population was established.
   We compared the home ranges and distribution of kills of 8 lynx in the
   established center of the population with those of 6 lynx at the
   expanding front of the population. Home ranges overlapped between males
   and females and were exclusive within the sexes in both areas, but at
   the front, home-range sizes were 3 times smaller. The distributions of
   kills were more concentrated, and distances between consecutive kills
   were shorter at the front. Kill rates did not differ (P = 0.411), but
   the proportion of carcasses consumed was 10\% higher at the center than
   at the front (P = 0.037). We suggest that the smaller lynx home ranges
   at the front indicated a denser predator population and that the spatial
   concentration of kills there was due to a higher prey availability.
   Ungulates seemed to be more abundant and clustered, and lacked
   anti-predator behavior in areas where their natural predators had been
   missing for a longer period. We interpreted the decrease of the lynx
   population in the center of the population as a numerical response of
   the predator to a readaptation (numerical and behavioral response) by
   the prey.}},

Abstract = {{We studied a semi-isolated cottontail rabbit (Syltvilagus floridanus)
   population in southern Illinois from 1982 to 1990 to determine patterns
   of population change following a tularemia epizootic in 1980 and to
   evaluate the role of enzootic disease in population regulation. The
   population reached a density of >14 rabbits/ha in the best habitats 7
   years after the 1980 epizootic, but drought in summer 1988 and harvest
   that autumn reduced the population base. Condition indices and necropsy
   did not indicate food as a limiting factor at the observed peak density.
   Prior to 1988, serosurveys to detect IgM/IgG immunoglobulins to
   Francisella tularensis provided the only evidence of enzootic tularemia
   in the population, but clinical cases were detected beginning April
   1988. During spring 1988-winter 1990, 32.4\% of 37 radio-marked animals
   died from tularemia. Concurrently, IgM seroprevalence rates increased,
   and some regression models revealed that IgM seroprevalence predicted
   seasonal survival. A deterministic model based on seasonal and annual
   survival data, estimates of recruitment, and known harvest removal
   mimicked population trends evident from roadside counts and
   mark-recapture population estimates. Simulations without enzootic
   tularemia produced populations larger than those with tularemia,
   irrespective of drought and harvest effects. Our findings illustrate the
   risk wildlife populations may face from disease and the need to monitor
   health of intensively managed or isolated wildlife populations.}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment of demosponges (Porifera, Demospongiae) was monitored
   bimonthly for one year (March 1987 - March 1988) on acrylic plates, and
   compared to cover of adults, in six rocky and coral reef habitats at
   Santa Marta, Colombian Caribbean, an area subjected to seasonal,
   upwelling-outwelling regimes. According to suggestive but not
   significant trends, recruitment rates are more positively influenced by
   the total sponge cover near groups of plates than by cover at a larger
   (habitat) scale; recruit mortality is lower where recruitment is higher.
   These findings are in agreement with a model of higher settlement
   (probably due to short-distance dispersal) and lower postsettlement
   mortality within a few meters of adult sponges. Recruitment varied
   seasonally, being relatively high from May to November-December during
   the rainy, outwelling season, when seawater temperature was warmer,
   water turbidity higher, and benthic algal density lower; it was very low
   from January to April during the dry, upwelling season.}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of offshore and nearshore reefs in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were
   undertaken during the latter part of 1992. A small, inshore platform
   reef located close to one of the Kuwait sources of the Gulf War oil
   spill had been partially impacted. However, corals were recovering and
   it supported a healthy fish community. No evidence of pollution damage
   was detected on the Saudi Arabian reefs, and a patchy distribution of
   mortality in three species of coral was found on the offshore Kuwait
   reefs. Analysis of long term changes in the Kuwait reef fish populations
   reveal a downward trend in numbers. It is concluded that natural
   fluctuations in the coral reef community may have effectively masked any
   supposed impact of the Gulf War, and suggested that only continued
   monitoring will reveal any longer term Gulf War effects.}},

Abstract = {{In preparation for a Filariasis Control programme in Samoa, during 1978
   monthly larval surveys of the vector mosquito Aedes polynesiensis were
   carried out in four study villages in the main island of Upolu. A more
   extensive survey of larval habitat distribution was then made in
   twenty-two villages of Upolu and eighteen of Savai'i island. to
   determine the importance of habitat types according to their abundance,
   volume of water and whether their productivity was permanent or
   seasonal. Ae.aegypti larval densities and habitat distribution were also
   monitored and the occurrence of predatory Toxorhynchites amboinensis
   larvae in northern Upolu was recorded from forty-one collections.
   Aedes Breteau and container indices fluctuated with the pattern of
   rainfall in two coastal villages and an inland bush village, but not in
   a coconut plantation community. The five main Aedes larval habitat types
   encountered were: 200 litre water-storage drums, discarded tins and
   bottles, coconut shells, automobile tyres and treeholes. Aedes immatures
   occurred perennially in drums and tree holes, but breeding discontinued
   in tins, bottles and coconut shells during the driest month of July.
   For Ae.polynesiensis in Upolu the Breteau and container indices of 104.5
   +/- SD 80.9 and 35.3 +/- 12.4 respectively were significantly higher
   than those in Savai'i: 33.1 +/- 25.0 and 24.3 +/- 20.0 respectively.
   Likewise for Ae.aegypti the Breteau and container indices of 50.8 +/-
   32.5 and 23.9 +/- 15.6, respectively, were also significantly higher
   than those in Savai'i: 12.7 +/- 17.1 and 9.4 +/- 13.2 respectively.
   Habitat types greater or lesser importance were determined by plotting
   the percentage of each type of container utilized for Aedes breeding
   against the percentage of each type amongst all larva-positive
   containers. Ae.polynesiensis preferred tree-hole's but not water-storage
   drums. Ae.aegypti preferred drums and tyres; mixed populations of larvae
   of both species were commonest in these two types of habitat.
   Ae.polynesiensis occurred in every village. Ae.aegypti was encountered
   in all twenty-two villages surveyed in Upolu and nine of eighteen
   villages in Savai'i.
   Total larval surveys revealed that drums and tree-holes contained the
   highest numbers of Aedes larvae. The study provided criteria for
   planning a control programme.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effect of plant transformation on opine catabolic
   (and pathogenic) Agrobacterium, we designed an experimental model in
   which the changes of a bacterial population associated with the root
   system of plants could be easily monitored. The bacterial population was
   composed of opine catabolic and noncatabolic strains of Agrobacterium.
   Bacteria were cocultivated with either transformed or normal Lotus
   plants. The composition of the bacterial population was estimated by
   dilution and plating of the growth medium on various media. We
   demonstrated that growth of bacteria was stimulated when they were
   associated with transformed plants. Furthermore, growth of
   opine-utilizing bacteria was specifically favored when bacteria were
   associated with transformed plants, but not when bacteria were
   associated with normal plants. This work indicates that transformation
   of plant cells by agrobacteria indeed can favor growth of the catabolic
   strain. This finding may lead to creation of engineered plant-bacteria
   interactions in which both partners will benefit from their association.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a long-term open-air fumigation experiment, Scots pine was
   exposed continuously to SO2 pollution following a predetermined pattern
   of hourly mean values based upon monitoring data from a site in central
   England. Although annual mean concentrations did not exceed 22 ppb, up
   to 20 \% of trees developed foliar necrosis in three consecutive growing
   seasons similar to published descriptions of acute SO2 damage. The
   number of trees affected increased with SO2 concentration, and there was
   a significant tendency for the same trees to be affected in consecutive
   years, implying that sensitivity to these levels was genetically based.
   As a group, trees showing necrotic symptoms were not significantly
   retarded in their growth, although their 1990 budburst was significantly
   delayed and the few trees which lost over 50 \% of their foliage were
   visibly stunted. Fumigation of potted trees for short periods in
   chambers with up to 1000 ppb SO2 failed to produce any comparable
   effects. Regression analyses between the number of plants affected each
   year and a range of gas concentration parameters showed mean
   concentrations during a critical period in May to be most closely
   related to the development of symptoms, although no effects became
   visible until approximately 5 wk later. The start date for the critical
   period differed between years, and for the two years for which budburst
   data were available it coincided with the start of needle elongation.
   The duration of the critical period lay in the range 6-14 d. Linear
   extrapolation from the data suggested the threshold mean SO2
   concentration for visible injury to be in the range 6-8 ppb (measured
   during the critical period during needle expansion) although this could
   underestimate the true value.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1980 and 1986, introduced Australian brushtail possums
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) were eradicated from Kapiti Island, a 1965 ha
   nature reserve. The possum population was monitored by live- and
   kill-trapping, before and at various times during the eradication
   programme, to assess the effects of population reduction on the
   reproduction and age structure of the survivors. About 70-75\% of the
   island's possums were killed in the first three years, but the massive
   and rapid population reduction had little effect on the percentage of
   females breeding, or the timing of the main breeding season in autumn,
   although the percentage of females breeding in spring increased from 0.3
   to 5\%. There was no evidence that trapping produced local shortages of
   males and disrupted normal breeding. The age structure of the population
   changed as numbers were reduced, to contain higher proportions of young
   (0-3 years old) and old (greater-than-or-equal-to 10 years old) animals.
   The last 80 animals killed were mostly either recent recruits (26\%) or
   older possums which had survived throughout the trapping programme
   (56\%).
   The minimal effect of population reduction on reproduction may have
   reflected the short time available for habitat recovery relative to the
   period of eradication and to possum longevity. The observed changes in
   age structure suggested density-dependent changes in survival,
   particularly of juveniles.}},

Abstract = {{A new census and monitoring method for populations of breeding Puffins
   was developed and applied to the population on the island of Hernyken.
   The method is based on a star-shaped model of evenly spaced sampling
   plots throughout the topographic surface area of the colony. The main
   advantages of this approach are that all areas are equally represented,
   the variance of the estimates can be calculated, and it reveals changes
   in breeding density in any part of the colony as well as changes of the
   total colony area. The method can easily be used to survey other
   resources, even when operating on highly different scales. The number of
   apparently occupied Puffin burrows on Hernyken decreased from 119700 in
   1979 to 43 160 in 1988. This was presumably the result of very few
   chicks being reared by the Rost Puffins during 1969-1982. In 1983-1987,
   when no recruitment was expected, the annual population decline of
   13.7\% was independent of burrow density and probably equalled the adult
   mortality rate. In 1988, there was a significant recruitment of first
   breeders, and these birds settled in the most densely populated areas.}},

   distribution of Y. malinellus in Europe and its spread east through the
   Cascade Mountains and south into Oregon, we perceive there will be no
   barrier to its movement through Oregon into California. Low rates of
   parasitism in Washington contrast with high parasitism throughout its
   native home of temperate Eurasia. Sleeve-cage exclusion of predators
   showed that generalist predators caused 40-60\% and 20-50\% mortality of
   young larvae and cocooned larvae or pupae, respectively. Egg mass
   predation through August of 1989 varied between 10\% and 60\% at two
   localities. Maximum daily pheromone trap catch and egg mass densities
   monitored from 1988-1992 indicated populations were relatively stable in

Abstract = {{Following the 1984-85 housefly (Musca domestica L.) resistance survey, a
   similar survey was carried out between January 1990 and April 1992 in
   order to monitor changes in UK housefly resistance. Samples of fly
   populations were collected from 35 farms throughout England and Wales.
   Dose-response data were obtained by topical application and feeding test
   methods. For both methods the knockdown (KD) after 48 h was used for all
   the dose-response comparisons. The ranges of resistance factors for the
   topical application method were for methomyl, 1.6-20.0 at KD50 and
   4.5-34.4 at KD95; for azamethiphos, 2.5-58.5 at KD50 and 5.0-2604 at
   KD95; for pyrethrins+piperonyl butoxide, 1.2-9.6 at KD50 and 1.6-14.7 at
   KD95; and for permethrin, 2.2-118.8 at KD50 and 4.3-200.0 at KD95. The
   ranges of the resistance factors for the feeding tests were for
   methomyl, 1.2-56.1 at KD50 and 3.1-80.0 at KD95, and for azamethiphos,
   3.9-125.0 at KD50 and 4.4-380.0 at KD95.  The means of resistance
   factors for all of the insecticides showed increases over those obtained
   in a previous survey carried out in 1984-85. The significance of the
   results for housefly control in intensive animal units in the UK is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of pheromone components, pheromone dose in the dispenser,
   aging of dispenser in the field, and trap type on trapping efficiency of
   males of the honeydew moth, Cryptoblabes gnidiella (Mill.) (Lepidoptera:
   Pyralidae), were investigated. At dosages of 2 or 0.2 mg, a binary blend
   containing (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Ald) and (Z)-13-octadecenal
   (Z13-18:Ald) (1:1) was as effective in attracting males as a quaternary
   blend containing Z11-16:Ald, (E)-11-hexadecenal (E11-16:Ald), Z13-18:Ald
   and (E)-13-octadecenal (E13-18:Ald), (10:1:10:1). Within the range of 20
   to 2000 mug pheromone/dispenser, response of males increased positively
   with the pheromone dose; however, a load of 10 or 20 mg/dispenser was
   significantly less attractive to males than 2 mg/dispenser. The effect
   of aging of the dispenser in the field on trapping efficiency was
   significant. Captures in traps baited with 3- and 4-week-old septa were
   lower than those in traps baited with 1- or 2-week-old septa. The
   gradual loss of attractancy exhibited by rubber septa indicates that
   septa should be renewed within 2-3 weeks. The release rate of the
   pheromone was measured in a flow system and monitored with Z11-16:Ald
   only. The emission was almost constant for 18 days and then decreased
   gradually until the 34th day. The nonsticky IPS trap was as effective in
   capturing honeydew moth males as the sticky Pherocon IC trap. The
   possibility of using the nonsticky, nonsaturating and easy-to-handle IPS
   traps may lead to better and easier monitoring of honeydew moth
   populations.}},

Pages = {{163-170}},
Abstract = {{IMIS is being set up as part of the German Government's National
   Response Plan for dealing with the consequences of a large scale
   radioactive contamination of the environment. The legal basis for this
   is the `Act on the Precautionary Protection of the Population against
   Radiation Exposure (Strahlenschutzvorsorgegesetz)'1 of December 1986.
   The IMIS system has three operational action levels. Level 3 covers the
   collection of radiological data from state-of-the-art monitoring
   networks and measurement laboratories. Level 2 involves computerised
   data processing and quality control, based on standardised procedures
   for the collection and presentation of measurements. This level also
   includes the use of transport and dose assessment models. Level 1
   includes evaluation of the data, management of the consequences of a
   given situation, legal enforcement of protective measures and provision
   of information to the public. The IMIS system was commissioned by the
   Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation, and Reactor Safety and is
   being supplied under the turnkey contract by a consortium led by DIGITAL
   equipment in conjunction with DORNIER. The responsibility for the
   contract is with the Federal Office for Radiation Protection. In its
   final form the IMIS system will consist of a total of 75 RISC computers
   linked together by an efficient packet-switched Wide Area Network, WAN
   (X.25). Owing to various demands of the individual users three different
   types of RISC computers are used. The system software includes ULTRIX,
   TCP/IP and X windows. The relational database management system ORACLE
   is used together with the query language SQL-Plus. Statistical analyses
   are carried out with the standard product SAS. The geographical
   information system TERRA provides all the tools necessary for a detailed
   geographic presentation of the data.}},

Abstract = {{Following a major accidental release of radionuclides to the atmosphere.
   appropriate countermeasures must be taken to mitigate the consequences
   to the population and the environment. Time constraints will force the

   the main model parameters can lead to erroneous and cost-ineffective
   decisions. To circumvent these difficulties. a real-time assimilation
   database containing monitoring and accident-specific data is proposed.
   Comparison of this dynamic database with a dispersion/deposition model
   and the application of physical principles can help to reduce the
   uncertainty in the early radiological assessment. Methods based on fuzzy
   set theory to infer information from quantities that are      imprecise,
   incomplete or not totally reliable are proposed. Practical steps to
   implement an uncertainty reduction module in         the European
   emergency decision support system RODOS are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Some recollections are given regarding the introduction of alpha track
   etching detectors for integrating radon individual and environmental
   monitoring 25 years ago. The current status, and efforts to standardise
   these methods, are briefly described.  However, more important than
   improving measurement techniques appears to be a balanced judgment of
   the potential health risks associated with radon, in particular in
   dwellings. New radio-epidemiological studies in former East Germany
   confirm earlier observations that there is little or no evidence of
   increased lung cancer risk for populations living in high-radon areas.
   Only among early uranium miners is there an increase in lung cancer, to
   be explained by synergistic effects of heavy smoking, ore dust, toxic
   fumes, etc., and extremely high radon exposures. The large scale and
   obviously effective worldwide application of radon for therapeutic
   reasons also indicates that lung cancer from early mining should not be
   used as a basis for risk estimates in buildings, and intervention levels
   (if required at all) should become substantially increased. Also.
   detectable differences in the genotoxic effects of radon and smoking in
   lung cancers deserve special attention in the discussion about potential
   radon health hazards.}},

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that reserves create a hazard because pest
   insects are more abundant in unmanaged forest reserves than in managed
   forests, pheromone trapping of Ips typographus was done within and

   southern Sweden. Initially, two 2 km perpendicular transects centered in
   the Tallet reserve did not show higher abundance of insects in the
   reserve in 1986 and 1987. A second hypothesis, that more predators
   existed in the diverse ecosystem in the reserves (giving fewer bark
   beetles) was tested. An important predator of bark beetles, Thanasimus
   formicarius, was monitored with kairomone traps inside and outside
   reserves, together with the prey in 1989. The catches of the prey (Ips)
   showed the same pattern as earlier, The predator was caught in small
   numbers, but in a pattern opposite to the predictions of the hypothesis
   of higher catches inside the reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Between September 1984 and January 1993, monthly counts of southern
   right whales were made from up to four vantage points in the De Hoop
   Nature Reserve, South Africa. Evidence from aerial surveys indicates
   that these vantage points are well situated in relation to the main
   concentration of right whales off De Hoop. Right whales arrive in June,
   reach peak abundance in September and depart in December or January. The
   incidence of calves increases from zero in June to 15-22\% between
   August and October (reflecting the season of births), before increasing
   again to 33\% in November and 42\% in December (reflecting the earlier
   departure of animals without calves). The numbers of right whales seen
   off De Hoop on aerial surveys from 1971 to 1992 have increased at a rate
   faster than that of the inshore population as a whole, indicating a
   degree of net immigration into die area. The rate of this immigration
   may have slowed down during the past 10 years. Shore counts for adults
   show a positive correlation with aerial counts in the same year,
   confirming their utility in monitoring future trends in abundance.}},

Abstract = {{The more stringent requirements imposed on wastewater treatment systems
   result in an increasing demand for on-line monitoring equipment for
   these processes. The paper presents the modification of a fully
   operational respirographic biosensor to allow simultaneous and on-line
   biokinetic characterization of both BOD-removal and nitrification
   capacities of activated sludge.
   For this characterization, advantage is taken of the calibration
   measurements that are performed regularly (every 2-3 h) during normal
   operation of this biosensor. The injection of a well chosen calibration
   mixture of readily biodegradable BOD and ammonia to a small activated
   sludge filled bioreactor results in oxygen uptake rate profiles that are
   interpreted in the framework of a mathematical model that describes the
   combined oxygen consumption for BOD removal and nitrification. Model
   identification gives rise to biokinetic parameters (max. conversion
   rates and affinity constants) that are indicative of the different
   metabolic capacities of the activated sludge. It is shown that this
   information can he used to assess the effect of injected wastewater
   samples on the sludge condition, e.g. adaptation or inhibition, and
   allows one to follow the change in relative abundance of heterotrophic
   and nitrifying populations.
   Special attention is paid to the proper composition of the calibration
   solution. Especially the ratio between NOD and BOD is found to be
   critical. With the aid of simulation, sub-optimal experimental designs
   are proposed that allow reliable equation of the biokinetic parameters.
   Fully, validation of the proposed design is given with experimental
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The Israel Ministry of Health is now revising its regulations for the
   assurance of safe water quality in public swimming pools. Since it is
   not possible to monitor each of the Pathogenic microorganisms, it is
   often recommended to monitor indicator bacteria which provide indirect
   information on the water quality in the swimming pool. Three indicator
   microorganisms are often recommended: coliform counts(total coliforms,
   fecal coliforms or E. Coli), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas
   aeruginosa. A four year survey of the water        quality of swimming
   pools in the Jerusalem District was conducted in order to determine
   whether the monitoring of all three indicators ia necessary to assure
   safe water quality or ia it sufficient to monitor only a single
   microorganism. A statistical analysis, conducted by using several
   different statistical techniques, reveals that the populations of the
   three indicator organisms are significantly interdependent but the
   correlations between each pair of these indicators are not sufficient to
   base a prediction of any of the organisms based on the measurements of
   the others. Therefore, it is concluded that monitoring of all three
   indicators should be recommended in order to provide an adequate picture
   of the water quality in swimming pools.}},

Abstract = {{The diet of the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus), a
   medium-sized ground-dwelling marsupial, was monitored (using faecal
   analysis) in a multiaged eucalypt forest site, and a regrowth eucalypt
   forest site in south-eastern Australia. In the multiaged forest P.
   tridactylus was primarily mycophagous, consuming the sporocarps
   (fruiting bodies) of at least 58 fungal species. Most of these taxa were
   hypogeal (underground fruiting) basidiomycetes thought to form
   mycorrhizae on the roots of a variety of plants. The percentage
   occurrence of fungus in faeces decreased in spring and summer and
   increased in autumn and winter. This pattern was opposite to the
   changing occurrence in faeces of other food types, and the percentage
   occurrence of spores of a major fungus species. At the regrowth forest
   site the quantity of fungus in faeces of P. tridactylus was lower but
   more constant over time. There were also differences in the percentage
   occurrence of spores of at least two fungal species. Additionally, the
   diversity of fungal taxa found as spores in faeces at the regrowth site
   was significantly lower (on average) than that recorded in faeces from
   the multiaged site. Differences in the fungal diets of the two P.
   tridactylus populations may be partially attributable to the disturbance
   (fire and logging) histories of each site.}},

Abstract = {{I employed mark-recapture techniques to monitor trends in the population
   density of feral pigs in a tropical woodland habitat containing cereal
   crops, and compared density indices in this habitat with other similar
   habitat not containing cereal crops. Over the duration of the study
   there was no significant trend for increase or decrease but population
   density fluctuated seasonally between 2.2 and 3.5 pigs km(-2) in the
   woodland site containing cereal crops. A numerical response model was
   developed relating observed exponential rate of increase of feral pigs
   to antecedent rainfall. The model estimated the maximum exponential rate
   of increase ((r)max) of feral pigs to be 0.065+/-0.017 (s.e.) month(-1)
   or 0.781+/-0.21 (s.e.) year(-1). Comparison of indices of population
   density of feral pigs in woodland habitat with cereal crops and similar
   woodland habitat without cereal crops demonstrated that the presence of
   intensive cereal cropping increased population density of feral pigs
   almost four-fold. Population density in the woodland habitat without
   cereal crops was estimated to be 0.8 pigs km(-2). I interpret the
   response to rainfall and the variation in density in response to an
   increase in the amount of available food as evidence that feral pig
   populations are limited primarily by food availability.}},

Abstract = {{An evaluation of the rate and extent of population reduction that can be
   achieved by trapping feral pigs was conducted in a subalpine area of
   Kosciusko National Park in south-eastern New South Wales. Movements of
   pigs during the programme were monitored by radio-telemetry. In total,
   142 pigs, including 12 of 17 (71\%) previously fitted with transmitters
   and known to be still on the study site, were captured over 330
   trap-nights at a cost of \$A104 per pig. A model fitted to the change in
   percentage of bait stations eaten per day relative to the cumulative
   number of pigs caught estimated a population reduction of 62\% of
   animals exposed to traps and only 28\% of the entire population.
   Determinants of trap success are discussed. During the trapping
   evaluation and in two preceding seasons, factors that influenced the
   rate at which bait stations were found and eaten were also examined.
   Both the locality characteristics of bait stations and the time of year
   were found to have significant effects on this rate.}},

Abstract = {{Rabbit-breeding stops were monitored over 35 ha of improved farmland,
   with relatively stable rabbit numbers, in North Canterbury, New Zealand.
   The number of stops dug varied seasonally, with most in spring, fewest
   in autumn. Pasture quality appeared to have a marked influence on
   breeding activity and productivity of the rabbits. Of the 427 breeding
   stops located, litters were found in 33\%. Most (97\%) of these stops
   were lined with grass and belly fur from the doe. Most juvenile rabbit
   mortality occurred prior to weaning. Of the 126 litters monitored, 38\%
   were preyed upon, 29\% drowned and 20\% were either preyed upon or
   drowned prior to emergence. Young drowned when sufficient rainfall for a
   particular soil type caused flooding of stops. In all, 13\% of litters
   were weaned and left the breeding stop, with late spring-early summer
   being the most favourable period for survival. Predator numbers were
   lowest during this period. Ferrets were the most numerous predator; cats
   and harriers were also present. Disease was not significant. Of those
   rabbits that emerged, approximately 50\% survived to 14 weeks of age.
   Less-frequent drowning during a sequence of dry years may explain an
   increase in rabbit number observed in previous years. This may make it
   possible to predict the need for control.}},

Abstract = {{Under the mandate of a Species Survival Plan (SSP), reproductive status
   was assessed in 128 cheetahs maintained in 18 different institutions in
   North America. A mobile laboratory research team evaluated cheetahs
   using anesthesia, serial blood sampling, electroejaculation (males), and
   laparoscopy (females). Biomaterials were also collected for parallel
   studies of genetics, nutrition, and health. There was no mortality, and
   cheetahs were capable of reproducing naturally after these intense
   manipulatory examinations. No marked differences were observed in
   reproductive or endocrine characteristics between proven and unproven
   breeders. However, males consistently produced teratospermic ejaculates,
   and cheetah sperm were compromised in conspecific or heterologous in
   vitro fertilization systems. Structurally abnormal sperm were found to
   be filtered by the oocyte's zona pellucida. More than 80\% of the
   females were anatomically sound, but morphological and endocrine
   evidence suggested that approximately 50\% or more of the population may
   have had inactive ovaries at the time of the examination. Males ranging
   in age from 15 to 182 months produced spermic ejaculates, but motile
   sperm numbers/ejaculate and circulating testosterone concentrations were
   highest in males 60 to 120 months old. Parovarian cysts were observed in
   51.5\% of female cheetahs, but comparisons between proven and unproven
   subpopulations revealed that this abnormality likely had no influence on
   fertility. Fresh luteal tissue was not observed in any nonpregnant or
   nonlactating female, strongly suggesting that the cheetah is an induced
   ovulator. Overall survey results were discussed in the context of the
   etiology of reproductive inefficiency, especially with respect to the
   potential importance of biological versus management factors. Four high
   priority research areas in cheetah reproductive biology were identified:
   1) continuous monitoring of ejaculate quality in the extant population,
   while studying the impact of pleiomorphisms on fertility; 2) determining
   the potential relationship between libido and androgen production
   (excretion) in males; 3) confirming the extent of cyclic, or acyclic,
   ovarian activity in females; and 4) continued development of assisted
   reproductive techniques for enhancing management. In summary, a
   multidisciplinary, multi-institutional survey coordinated through the
   SSP is both possible and useful for generating a physiological and
   health database beneficial to driving further research and management
   initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{During the formulative stages of developing the Species Survival Plan
   (SSP) for the cheetah, the impact of infectious disease upon its
   survival in captivity was of prime consideration, together with
   genetics, nutrition, physiology, and behavior. This paper summarizes the
   results of an infectious disease surveillance program, initially
   designed to monitor the infectious agents associated with clinically
   normal and clinically ill cheetahs in captivity, but subsequently
   supplemented with data from free-living cheetahs. The focus was on two
   viral infections, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and feline
   rhinotracheitis virus. Results indicated that between 1989 and 1991,
   there was an increase in the seroprevalence (number antibody-positive
   animals) of cheetahs to feline coronavirus from 41\% to 64\% in
   captivity. During this same time period, there were only two documented
   cases of FIP in cheetahs in the United States. The results suggest that
   feline coronavirus (feline enteric coronavirus-feline infectious
   peritonitis group) or a closely related coronavirus of cheetahs is
   becoming endemic in the captive cheetah population.
   Further-serologic results from 39 free-living cheetahs demonstrated that
   there was a high seroprevalence (61\%) to feline coronavirus, although
   serum antibody titers were considerably lower than those encountered in
   captive cheetahs. The observation of a high percentage of free-living
   cheetahs, which were seropositive to feline herpesvirus (44\%), was
   unexpected, since it has been generally regarded that this infection is
   primarily associated with cheetahs in captivity.}},

Abstract = {{The avoidance of inbreeding is a primary goal of endangered species
   population management. In order to fully understand the effects of
   inbreeding on the fitness of natural and captive populations, it is
   necessary to consider fitness components which span the entire life
   cycle of the organism. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism
   for conservation genetics studies, we constructed 18 experimental lines
   derived from wild-type stocks which were homozygous for chromosome 2
   (this chromosome constitutes 38\% of the genome or is equivalent to F =
   0.38). For six of these lines which exhibited a reduced homozygous
   fitness, we estimated the relative values of fitness components
   operating at both the juvenile stage (pre-adult viability) and adult
   stage (female fecundity and male-mating ability) of the life cycle.
   Males in these lines showed a markedly reduced mating ability, while
   viability and female fecundity were much less affected. Equilibrium
   values of the wild-type chromosomes in these lines were accurately
   predicted using a model that incorporated into it these independently
   estimated fitness components. These results emphasize the importance of
   studying all fitness components directly to determine overall fitness. A
   reduced mating ability among inbred males of a captive population can
   have serious consequences for its future sustainability, and can further
   jeopardize reintroduction efforts; consequently, a program to carefully
   monitor the reproductive success of individual males, as well as other
   fitness components, is recommended.  (C) 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Six pooled human milk samples were analysed for 50 individual PCB
   congeners, of which 24 were identified in all the samples. Mean total
   PCB (SIGMAPCB) concentrations were 10 ng/g of whole milk (equivalent to
   an average of 0.39 mug/g lipid). The milk samples were pooled into
   groups to comprise rural, semi-rural and urban areas. However, no clear
   differences were observed between PCB concentrations or congener
   patterns between the different pooled samples.
   The contribution of individual PCDDs, PCDFs and mono-ortho- (mono-o-)
   and di-o-substituted PCB congeners to the total calculated toxic
   equivalent values (SIGMATEQ) in the UK population were determined based
   on results from the present study and data from Startin et al. (1989).
   Using the toxic equivalent factors (TEFs) proposed by Safe (1990) for
   PCBs and by the NATO/CCMS (1988) for PCDD/Fs, the TEQs calculated for
   the monitored PCBs made a greater contribution towards the SIGMATEQs
   than PCDD/Fs.The main contributors to the SIGMATEQ (data reported as TEQ
   in pg/g lipid) were the mono-o-substituted PCB congeners \# 118 (17.7),
   \# 156 (15.3) and \# 105 (9.95), 2,3,4,7,8-P5CDF (11), 1,2,3,7,8-P5CDD

Abstract = {{This paper tests the proposition that a small set of plant, animal, and
   abiotic processes structure ecosystems across scales in time and space.
   Earlier studies have suggested that these key structuring processes
   establish a small number of dominant temporal frequencies that entrain
   other processes. These frequencies often differ from each other by at
   least an order of magnitude. If true. ecosystems therefore will have a
   few dominant frequencies that are endogenously driven and that are
   discontinuously distributed.
   This paper additionally tests the proposition that these structuring
   processes should also generate a discontinuous distribution of spatial
   structures coupled with the discontinuous frequencies. If that is the
   case, animals living in specific landscapes should demonstrate the
   existence of this lumpy architecture by showing gaps in the distribution
   of their sizes. This proved to be the case for birds and mammals of the
   boreal region forest and the short-grass prairie. Alternative hypotheses
   to explain the body mass clumps include architectural, developmental,
   historical, and trophic causes. These were all tested by comparing
   body-mass clump distributions (1) in ecosystems having different spatial
   structures (forest, grassland, and marine pelagic) and (2) in different
   animal groups having different body plans (birds and mammals) or feeding
   habits (carnivore, omnivore, and herbivore). The only hypothesis that
   could not be rejected is that the body-mass clumps are entrained by
   discontinuous hierarchical structures and textures of the landscape.
   There is evidence for at least eight distinct habitat ``quanta,{''} each
   defined by a distinct texture at a specific range of scales. These eight
   quanta together cover tens of centimetres to hundreds of kilometres in
   space and at least months to millennia in time.
   There is a striking similarity, but not identity, between the clump
   structure of prairie and boreal animals. This indicates that many
   processes that form qualitative habitat structure are common to both
   landscapes or ecosystems, but a few are landscape specific, particularly
   over larger scales. That conclusion is extended to all terrestrial
   ecosystems by an analysis of the body-mass clump structure of all North
   American birds.
   In contrast, there are striking differences in clump structure between
   landscapes and ``waterscapes,{''} indicating that fundamentally
   different processes shape structure in terrestrial and open ocean
   systems.
   The discontinuous body-mass structure provides a bioassay of
   discontinuous ecosystem structure. Mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and
   herbivores all show the same number of body-mass clumps, and the gaps in
   these distributions occur al the same body masses. Mammals and birds
   show the same number of body-mass clumps, but the mass gaps for mammals
   occur at larger sizes than those for birds in such a way that the
   log-transformed body-mass gaps for mammals are correlated linearly with
   those for birds. Hence there is a simple cross-calibration between the
   mammal and bird bioassays.
   I compiled and analyzed published data on home ranges in order to
   convert body masses into an absolute linear measure of geometric
   structures in the landscape. A new and general equation was developed
   relating home-range size to body mass, and was tested by reanalyzing
   published data for mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores and
   for birds. I conclude: (1) Birds and mammals of all trophic levels
   utilize resources in their foraging areas in the same way by measuring
   the spatial grain of habitat patches with a resolution defined as a
   function of their size (i.e., the animal's step length or minimum unit
   of measurement). The step length is a morphological function of the size
   of animals and is not significantly affected by trophic status or
   taxonomy of the groups considered. That explains why all trophic levels
   and both birds and mammals show the same qualitative body-mass clump
   structure. (2) Home-range data can convert the body-mass data to a
   quantitative estimate of texture, i.e., of fractal dimension of the
   landscape.
   The landscape forms a hierarchy that contains breaks in object sizes,
   object proximities, and textures at particular scales. Animals also
   demonstrate a hierarchy of decisions whose target suddenly shifts at
   specific scales in space and time. The interaction between these two
   hierarchies produces the discontinuous body-mass clump structure. The
   breaks in geometry in the landscape occur because structuring processes
   exert their influence over defined ranges of scale. The temporal and
   architectural structure of habitat quanta are in general determined by
   three classes of processes, each dominating over three different ranges
   of scale. Vegetative processes that determine plant growth, plant form,
   and soil structure dominate the formation of texture at fine microscales
   of centimetres to tens of metres in space and days to decades in time.
   At the other, macroscale extreme, slow geomorphological processes
   dominate the formation of a topographic and edaphic structure at large
   scales of hundreds to thousands of kilometres and centuries to
   millennia. At the mesoscales in between, contagious disturbance
   processes such as fire, insect outbreak, plant disease, and water flow
   dominate the formation of patterns over spatial scales of hundreds of
   metres to hundreds of kilometres. In addition, the direct impacts of
   grazing by large herbivores and of human activities, and the indirect
   effects of large predators and animal disease, further transform spatial
   patterns over these meso-scales. These processes operate on time scales
   of years to decades, making them critically important in determining
   whether present local, regional, and global human influences will
   trigger a transition in vegetation types, and, if so, how rapidly.
   The paper provides a direction for the development of programs to
   evaluate, monitor, and predict ecosystem and community changes across
   scales. The necessary research elements include (1) models that
   incorporate a few scale-dependent structuring processes to allow
   cross-scale analysis; (2) comparative studies of different disturbed and
   undisturbed landscapes using the animal body-mass bioassay technique to
   identify critical scales of ecosystem geometry; (3) analysis of remote
   imagery to identify spatial discontinuities and regions of scale
   invariance; and (4) behavioral studies of the hierarchy of animal
   decisions to identify species groups vulnerable to predicted (using
   models) or observed (using remote imagery) changes in vegetation
   geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Marine invertebrates growing epifaunally on red mangrove (Rhizophora
   mangle) prop roots in the Indian River, Florida, USA, were studied in a
   small mangrove island (Jim Island) through which a number of channels
   had been cut. Roots hanging down into the water supported diverse
   epifaunal communities including sponges, oysters, barnacles, bryozoans,
   and ascidians. To determine what factors control species' population
   dynamics and contribute to the high degree of spatial heterogeneity
   characteristic of communities in this unique habitat, two hypotheses
   were tested: (1) Distributions of species on the roots are controlled by
   differential growth and mortality due to physical features; and (2)
   Recruitment, as influenced by larval supply, structures the community.
   Four channels of the island were chosen for comparison and
   experimentation. Distributions and abundances of epifauna in the
   channels were determined and physical parameters (i.e., temperature, pH,
   salinity, flow, turbidity) were measured over a 13-mo period. Adult and
   early juvenile organisms were transplanted among channels and growth and
   survival were monitored. Patterns of water flow in the island were
   studied, and plankton samples were taken to determine how larval supply
   varied among channels in different parts of the island. General patterns
   of recruitment were measured for 9 mo and patterns were compared to
   adult distributions.
   Epifaunal cover differed among the study channels, with dramatic
   differences in abundance and species diversity. Except for flow,
   physical factors did not differ significantly among channels. Flow rate,
   per se, was not responsible for disjunct distributions since neither
   adult nor juvenile survival (processes expected to be most affected by
   flow) differed among channels. Plankton samples and recruitment
   measurements revealed that the importance of larval supply depended on
   the life history of the individual species. Those producing short-lived
   lecithotrophic larvae showed patchy distributions that were strongly
   affected by the location of source populations and prevailing patterns
   of water flow. Species with long-lived planktotrophic larvae were more
   evenly distributed and post-settlement processes played a more important
   role in their population dynamics.
   On large temporal or spatial scales, the effects of physical factors on
   juvenile and adult organisms are probably quite important in controlling
   epifaunal distributions. However, in this study, the distributions of
   organisms on Rhizophora mangle root within Jim Island were best
   explained by differential larval input, with larval life history
   determining the strength of coupling between adult populations, larval
   supply, and patterns of recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment to study the effects of habitat fragmentation on
   biological diversity was commenced in an Eucalyptus forest, in February
   1985, at Wog Wog in southeastern New South Wales, Australia. The two
   hypotheses which are being tested are (1) that habitat fragmentation
   reduces biological diversity, and (2) that the reduction in diversity is
   fragment-size dependent.
   The experimental design consists of three fragment-sizes replicated six
   times. The sizes are 0.25 ha, 0.875 ha, and 3.062 ha, the two larger
   ones being progressively c. 3.5 times the size of the smaller ones. Four
   replicates (12 fragments) were retained as Eucalyptus forest when the
   surrounding land was cleared for a softwood (Pinus radiata) plantation.
   Two replicates (six fragments) are controls in an adjacent State Forest.
   The sampling is stratified into slopes, drainage lines, and inner and
   outer zones, with samples replicated twice in each stratum. Thus, there
   are two outer slope and two outer drainage-line sample sites, and two
   inner slope and two inner drainage-line sample sites. This gives 144
   permanent sample sites within the Eucalyptus forest.
   Following the experimental treatment, a further 44 permanent sample
   sites were established between the fragments. Aranae, Phalangida,
   Formicidae, Scorpionidae, Diplopoda, Coleoptera, and vascular plants,
   are the main groups of organisms involved in the experiment. Mosses and
   liverworts, breeding birds, small ground-mammals, skinks, and bats, are
   also being monitored.
   Monitoring commenced in February 1985. The experimental treatment, i.e.
   forest fragmentation, took place during 1987. Two years after the
   treatment there were still no experimental results, because of the
   inherent delays in sorting and identifying the arthropods, and in
   establishing and managing the very large database involved. However, the
   analysis of some pre-treatment data is used to assess the experimental
   design. This analysis demonstrates the importance of adequate
   replication in ecological field experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Genuine or American mahogany is obtained from trees of the genus
   Swietenia (S. mahagoni, S. macrophylla, and S. humilis), and is one of
   the premier timbers of international commerce. The trade in mahogany
   commenced almost five centuries ago with S. mahagoni from the Caribbean;
   but following `commercial' extinction of this resource, trade became
   centred on mahogany populations in South and Central America (S.
   macrophylla). The trade in mahogany is predominantly from primary
   forests, and has led to population and genetic resource declines -
   particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. More recently, there
   have been an increasing number of `commercial' extinctions in South
   America. As the resource declines, pressures mount to accelerate the
   illegal extraction of mahogany from National Parks and lands reserved
   for indigenous ('Indian') peoples. Inability to control this trade
   threatens mahogany populations and genetic resources throughout its
   range, at the same time adversely affecting the livelihoods of
   indigenous peoples in the process.
   Mahogany often regenerates poorly following logging operations that are
   conducted using current management practices, and further research is
   required to determine the optimum biological and economic conditions for
   in situ silviculture. Attempts to cultivate mahogany in plantations have
   met with little success in the Americas, due mainly to effects of the
   shoot-borer (Hypsipyla grandella), a moth larva that damages terminal
   shoots, so leading to excessive branching and reduced timber value (Figs
   3 and 4). The success of mahogany plantations in the neotropics will
   require the development of an integrated pest-management system, perhaps
   involving the incorporation of pest-resistant genotypes within
   agro-forestry or mixed plantation systems.
   It is vital that appropriate silvicultural and trade practices are
   adopted to ensure sustainable mahogany extraction, while at the same
   time conserving an adequate population and genetic resource-base. To
   this end, effective trade monitoring and resource-regulation measures
   must be introduced to assist in controlling illegal trade and to
   encourage a scientifically managed, sustainable, utilization of
   mahogany. Two of the three mahogany species, S. humilis and S. mahagoni,
   have been listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade
   in Endangered Species (CITES). The third and only other recognized
   species of Swietenia, S. macrophylla, should also be considered for
   listing in CITES Appendix II, thereby benefiting from the international
   trade-monitoring and resource regulation requirements consequent upon
   such listing.}},

Abstract = {{Densities of larval Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Anopheles spp.
   populations were monitored in experimental plots of white rice, Oryza
   sativa L., and wild rice, Zizania palustris L., in Lake County, CA,
   during the spring and summer of 1989. Plant height, floral debris drop,
   water quality, and bacterial counts were measured and contrasted between
   the two systems. Anopheles spp. and C. tarsalis populations in wild rice
   were 6 and 2.6 times higher, respectively, than in the white rice over
   the entire season. A significantly greater number of notonectids and
   hydrophilid larvae were sampled in the wild rice treatments and did not
   appear to be responsible for the difference in larval mosquito
   populations. A positive correlation was found between average larval
   density and plant height for Anopheles spp. in both wild and white rice
   and for C. tarsalis in wild rice during the early growing season. In the
   latter half of the growing season, only Anopheles spp. densities showed
   a significant correlation with plant height. A significant positive
   correlation was demonstrated between the number of shed wild rice
   anthers and larval densities for both Anopheles spp. and C. tarsalis. No
   significant differences were noted in either water quality factors or
   bacterial counts between white and wild rice treatments. In the field,
   development of C. tarsalis larvae was slower in wild rice than in white
   rice plots before flowering but faster during flowering. However,
   temperature-adjusted developmental times were significantly shorter for
   the wild rice group only during flowering. In the laboratory, C.
   tarsalis completed development from second instar to adult when fed only
   wild rice pollen. These results suggest that wild rice pollen serves as
   a nutrient source for larvae in the field. In addition, the floral
   components of wild rice may serve as an oviposition attractant and
   structural refuge for the immature stages.}},

   (TAPS) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) affords an opportunity to
   assess retrospectively the environmental impacts of the resultant North
   Slope oil fields, now the largest single source of U.S. domestic oil
   production. As the oil field expanded, particularly to near-shore areas
   such as the Endicott Development, additional EIS documents were prepared
   to assess impacts not included in the original TAPS EIS. In the ensuing
   years, numerous agency-monitored and industry-sponsored environmental
   monitoring studies, estimated to average \$4 million per year, have been
   conducted in and around the oil field, making the Alaskan North Slope
   one of the most studied environments in North America.
   In this paper, the EIS requirement of the National Environmental Policy
   Act (NEPA) is examined as a predictive environmental risk assessment. A
   tabulated summary of the predicted environmental impacts from the
   original TAPS and offshore Endicott Development EIS documents is
   compared with the extensive amount of resultant monitoring data. These
   data confirm localized impacts to air and water quality; however,
   regulated discharges remain well below criteria established for the
   protection of human health and the environment. As predicted, some
   unavoidable habitat losses to resident and migratory wildlife have
   occurred within the oil field and pipeline corridors. Approximately 2\%
   of the land surface in developed portions of the oil field was actually
   altered. However, careful monitoring of wildlife populations
   demonstrates that no species has experienced a measurable decline, and
   most continue to utilize oil field habitat for breeding, nesting, and
   summer forage. As habitat does not appear to be limiting the growth of
   North Slope caribou herds, the Central Arctic Herd has been able to
   accommodate the incremental habitat loss due to the oil field and has
   shown a sevenfold increase in numbers since the oil field development
   began in the early 1970s. Offshore monitoring data for the gravel
   causeways verify the predicted small, localized effects on water
   circulation and show the possibility is low that fish are experiencing
   resulting significant negative effects.
   The challenge faced in the EIS process is not how to ensure zero impact,
   as this is not a realistic goal, but instead it is how to predict
   impacts and describe mitigation measures accurately to ensure that the
   resultant ecological responses remain within a normal range of ecosystem
   oscillations that can be used to describe sustainable development. This
   review demonstrates that in the EIS process, a well-designed program
   using the best available field data can indeed provide a relatively
   accurate prediction of subsequent impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Hardwoods are diverse, and they are important components in several
   forest regions of Canada. Yet low demand from the pulp and paper sector,
   abundant natural regeneration for several species, and high costs
   associated with seedling production and plantation establishment have
   restrained industries and governments from investing intensively into
   basic biological and genetic research of hardwoods. Recently, new
   interests have emerged for the utilization and conservation of hardwood
   species. To devise efficient gene conservation and breeding strategies
   for hardwoods, knowledge is needed about their genetic structure,
   genecology, and mating systems. Here we review information on the
   organization of genetic diversity in the few Canadian hardwood species
   that have been studied. Results derived from analyses of quantitative
   characters showed extensive genetic variation among populations and
   among individuals within populations in all species. Genetic variation
   among populations was found to be associated with environmental factors,
   especially for adaptive traits. Levels of genetic diversity were also
   found high in allozyme genetic markers. The application of molecular
   genetic markers at the DNA level in monitoring genetic diversity of
   hardwoods is also discussed. Information available regarding genetic
   diversity of Canadian hardwoods is insufficient to design efficient gene
   conservation strategies. Several programs investigating genetic
   diversity of hardwoods have been initiated in Canada, and should yield
   urgently needed data.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of gopher tortoises are declining throughout the southeastern
   United States, largely because of loss of habitat. Widespread monitoring
   of population sizes for gopher tortoises usually is done indirectly, by
   examining the burrows that tortoises construct. Indirect monitoring
   requires use of a correction factor, to relate numbers of burrows to
   numbers of tortoises. We demonstrate that the standard correction factor
   overestimates the number of tortoises in 22 of the 26 cases in our
   sample and that the relationship between numbers of burrows and numbers
   of tortoises differs among types of habitats. Using both published data
   and data from our own studies, we suggest that an accurate assessment of
   active burrows is a reliable way to relate numbers of burrows to numbers
   of tortoises.}},

Abstract = {{The average date and degree-day accumulation of peak egg deposition for
   each generation of grape berry moth, Endopiza viteana Clemens, during

   only two generations were observed in 1988. Egg deposition in 1988 was
   delayed on both a calendar and degree-day basis. Pheromone trap catch
   was an effective predictor of the temporal occurrence of grape berry
   moth egg deposition but was a poor indicator of the level or spatial
   distribution of larval damage. Action thresholds for initiating
   insecticide treatments of second-generation grape berry moth based on
   estimating population density during the 3rd wk in July were 17 and 3\%
   damaged clusters for early- and late-harvested varieties, respectively.
   The operating characteristics of the currently recommended sampling
   procedure, consisting of two vineyard sites and 50 grape clusters
   inspected per site, was compared with a calculated optimal procedure.
   The optimal procedure required the same amount of sampling time as the
   currently recommended procedure and consisted of sampling five sites and
   15 clusters per site. The optimal procedure performed better, but the
   difference between the two procedures was small. The results are
   discussed in the context of a risk-assessment approach for the
   management of the grape berry moth in New York State.}},

   Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess), and
   Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood, tended to cluster along the vertical
   trap plane but each tended to be uniformly distributed along the
   horizontal trap plane. These results suggested that the number of
   insects caught on a trap could be estimated accurately by counting a
   2.3-cm-wide vertical strip of the trap. This hypothesis was tested in
   four commercial greenhouses monitored with 586 yellow sticky traps in
   1987 and 1989. Trap-catch estimates from vertical strip counts were not
   significantly different from whole-trap counts (paired t tests) for six
   of the seven taxa caught on traps in these greenhouses. All regression
   coefficients obtained from least-squares linear regressions were
   significantly >0.2, and column counts (independent variable) explained
   >90\% of the observed variation in whole-trap counts (dependent
   variable) in 12 of the 23 cases examined. We concluded that 2.3-cm-wide
   vertical strip counts accurately predict insect densities on an entire
   trap. Because only 20\% of the trap area is counted, the technique
   presented reduces counting time by 80\% compared with whole-trap counts.}},

Abstract = {{Leafhopper populations were sampled with sweep nets in grain cover and
   vegetable crops during 1988 and 1989. Populations in vegetable crops
   consisted primarily of aster leafhopper, Macrosteles quadrilineatus
   Forbes, except for potato crops in which Empoasca spp. were common.
   Adult aster leafhoppers were caught several weeks before nymphs in each
   year. Peak catches of aster leafhopper adults and nymphs occurred in
   both June and july. Data were consistent with the hypothesis that aster
   leafhoppers migrate to Ohio vegetable-growing areas in late May and
   June. Air trajectory analysis indicated three possible source areas of
   M. quadrilineatus migrating into Ohio vegetable-production areas:
   Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma; western Ohio, Indiana, and
   Illinois; and a corridor extending from Ohio to the Dakotas. Bioassays
   for aster yellows during 1989 and 1990 indicated that the leafhopper
   populations present during those years contained very few inoculative
   individuals. Growers should base treatment decisions on monitoring for
   inoculative aster leafhoppers.}},

Abstract = {{A symposium was held 8 August 1991, at the annual meeting of the Society
   for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles and The Herpetologists' League
   in University Park, Pennsylvania. The topic, ``Amphibian Declines and
   Habitat Acidification{''} was selected for its relevance to the topical
   issues of a precipitous drop in many amphibian populations, and possible
   causation by acidic atmospheric deposition. As organizers, we felt that
   a rigorous approach to these issues requires meticulous field
   documentation of population fluctuations and correlated environmental
   measures of pollution, along with an experimental ecotoxicological
   analysis of possible anthropogenic causation. Because of the potential
   for large-scale environmental change acting synergistically with
   pollution across landscapes, the experimental elucidation of cause and
   effect will be extremely difficult. It appears that some amphibian
   populations fluctuate in an episodic fashion, but there are no long-term
   data bases adequate to determine whether particular declines are
   uniequivocally due to acidic deposition from non-point sources, other
   anthropogenic causes, natural causes, or interactions among them. This
   series of papers deals with the effects of acidic waters and soils on
   amphibians in England and North America. It is very clear that acidic
   habitats of natural and polluted origin exclude certain species and
   cause sub-lethal and lethal effects. However, no data are at hand which
   show directly that anthropogenic acidification causes amphibian
   populations to decline. There is considerable interest in the
   development of bioindicators of habitat decline. Net loss of body sodium
   and the embryonic curling defect in amphibians are examples of the best
   of such direct bioassays in acidified aquatic and terrestrial habitats.
   There is a strong need for standardization of test conditions so that
   better comparisons can be made among results from laboratories in
   different geographic regions. We recommend that a number of sites be
   chosen for long-term (10 year minimum) study of the relation between
   amphibian population cycles and anthropogenic change. This research
   would provide data not only specifically pertinent to the issue of
   amphibian declines, but would also provide valuable tests of the
   usefulness of amphibians as general bioindicators of ecosystem decline
   in response to anthropogenic stress. These issues are complex and are
   not amenable to quick solutions. A sustained commitment is needed by
   researchers and funding agencies to provide long-term monitoring and
   rigorous experimental tests of the causes of any declines in especially
   sensitive biotic components of ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the demographics of the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum
   nebulosum as part of a community-wide study on the effects of
   acidification in sub-alpine (elevation 3600 m) ponds in central
   Colorado. A decline in A. t. nebulosum at this site from 1982 to 1988
   has been hypothesized to result from embryonic mortality during a pulse
   of acidity that accompanies snowmelt in spring. Since 1988 we have
   monitored salamander population size, reproduction, and recruitment, and
   compared survival and individual growth rates among ponds which differ
   five-fold in acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC).
   Larval recruitment fluctuated dramatically from year to year, but we
   found no evidence that survival of either embryos or larvae was affected
   by pH. In each year, the pulse of snowmelt acidification was either
   benign, or occurred earlier than egg deposition. During 1990 and 1991 we
   followed individual egg masses and found that embryonic survival was
   high in all ponds and did not differ between high and low ANC ponds. In
   permanent ponds, survival of first-year larvae was high and independent
   of pH. Within cohorts, second-year larvae were actually larger in ponds
   with low ANC than in high ANC ponds. The largest source of mortality in
   the population between 1988 and 1991 was related to pond drying; about
   half of all hatchlings that survived to July perished in autumn when
   many of the ponds dried. Our results suggest that fluctuation in
   hydroperiod is as viable a working hypothesis as snowmelt acidification
   for the recent decline in this population. Our water chemistry data show
   that many ponds at Mexican Cut remain poorly buffered and that this
   acid-sensitive watershed should continue to be closely monitored.}},

Abstract = {{Organochlorine and mercury concentrations were determined in Osprey eggs
   collected from Maryland, Virginia, and Massachusetts during 1986-87. DDE
   concentrations were significantly different among locations. Median DDE
   concentrations did not decline significantly in eggs from Glenn L.
   Martin National Wildlife Refuge, Maryland, between 1973 and 1986. The
   median DDE residue for eggs from Martin Refuge in 1986 surpassed the
   value associated with 10\% eggshell thinning, but was below the value
   associated with production of 1.0 young per active nest, a level assumed
   to represent a stable population. DDD, DDT, dieldrin, PCB, and mercury
   residues in all eggs appeared insignificant with regard to potential
   effects on shell thickness or reproduction. DDE and PCB residues were
   lower in eggs collected in 1986-87 than in those collected in the 1970s
   for each area. DDD, DDT, and dieldrin were not detected in Martin Refuge
   eggs in 1986, representing a significant reduction since 1973. DDD, DDT,
   and dieldrin levels in Massachusetts and Virginia eggs in 1986-87 were
   similar to those in eggs from the 1970s for each state. Mercury residues
   in eggs from Martin Refuge may be increasing and although not
   significant in this study, may warrant future monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Lunar patterns of settlement of 15 Caribbean reef fishes were assessed
   from daily collections of newly arrived fishes from each of two small (A
   = 63 and B = 28 m2) patch reefs at Punta de San Blas (Panama) during two
   consecutive 2 yr periods (1984, 1985 and 1986, 1987). In 12 species
   settlement was lunar-cyclic, with a broad peak of activity around the
   new moon in 11 cases, and at first quarter in 1 species. However, 3 of
   these ``lunar-cyclic{''} species displayed intermittent semilunar
   periodicity in settlement, with peaks around the quarter moons. One
   other species had a semilunar cycle of settlement with peaks at both
   quarter moons. Two species apparently lacked lunar settlement cycles. In
   some, but not all, pairs of congeners: (a) monthly variation in
   settlement intensity was positively correlated, (b) the duration of
   settlement pulses in the same month consistently differed, and (c) the
   timing of settlement pulses in the same month often differed (although
   one species did not consistently arrive before the other). Recruitment
   of juvenile fish that survived to the end of the lunar cycle in which
   they settled was monitored monthly, concurrently with settlement, at a
   number of large sites scattered up to 2 km apart. The levels of
   variation in the amount of settlement and recruitment each month
   differed in only 2 of 17 cases, with settlement variation exceeding
   recruitment variation in only one of these. The intensity of recruitment
   was positively correlated with the intensity of settlement in 16 of 17
   cases. In 15 of those 16 cases, R2 values for linear regressions of
   recruitment on settlement exceeded R2 values for curvilinear regressions
   that would indicate either increasing or decreasing recruitment success
   with increasing intensity of settlement. Thus it appears that variation
   in recruitment can be used to estimate variation in settlement, and that
   recruitment success may be density-independent.}},

Abstract = {{Physical (temperature and salinity) and biological (zooplankton)
   properties were sampled over a 15 mo period in 1988 and 1989 to monitor
   nearshore environmental variability in northern Monterey Bay,
   California, USA. During the upwelling seasons of 1988 and 1989, there
   were two distinct bodies of water along the sampling transect. The
   offshore water body was characterized by recently upwelled water
   (typically < 12-degrees-C) while the nearshore body was significantly
   warmer (approaching 16-degrees-C). A sharp thermal gradient (=front)
   separated the two water bodies. This front persisted 6.5 km from shore
   throughout the upwelling season of 1988 and was present again in 1989.
   Zooplankton-assemblage analysis confirmed the presence of two distinct
   regions in northern Monterey Bay. We refer to this phenomenon as an
   ``upwelling shadow{''}, which is the result of the advection of recently
   upwelled water bearing nutrients and larvae past coastal recesses which
   are equatorward of upwelling centers.}},

Abstract = {{This study attempted to demonstrate whether an aspect of non-specific
   cellular immunity could be used as an indicator of fish health in
   populations of dab Limanda limanda exposed along a pollution gradient.
   Replicate samples of dab spleens were obtained during the Bremerhaven
   Workshop from a series of stations along a transect in the German Bight.
   Histochemical techniques, to demonstrate the components of the pigmented
   materials within melanomacrophage centres (MMCs), indicated varying
   amounts of breakdown cellular products (notably haemosiderin) to be
   present. The haemosiderin component was measured in each spleen section
   with the aid of a computerized image analyzer. Comparative results
   showed some inconsistencies in amounts of haemosiderin within MMCs
   between individual fish and replicated samples on stations. However,
   there were significant differences (p < 0.05) between stations overall,
   the amounts of haemosiderin being least at Stns 3 \& 9. Although these
   results may indicate an effect of contaminants, no apparent correlation
   with disease prevalences in the dab population sampled could be
   established. The technique seems promising, but some problems are
   mentioned and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of natural phytoplankton assemblages were taken on 4 occasions
   between 28 March and 19 April 1990 at 2 stations located to the
   southwest of Plymouth (UK) and incubated in experimental microcosms
   under constant light and temperature. C-14 incorporation into cell
   constituents {[}proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and low molecular
   weight metabolites (LMWM)] and the biochemical composition of the
   phytoplankton were monitored during the experiments. Different
   phytoplankton populations developed in the microcosms. Microflagellates
   which dominated in the first experiments were followed in later
   experiments by a multispecific bloom of chain-forming diatoms, and these
   in turn by a bloom of Phaeocystis sp. Each assemblage was characterized
   by a different metabolic behaviour. High C-14 incorporation into LMWM
   and lipids was observed during non-growth periods when microflagellates
   dominated. High C-14 incorporation into proteins and relatively high
   specific rates of protein synthesis (0.45 +/- 0.1 d-1) were measured
   during the late growth phase of the diatom bloom. Synthesis of
   acid-soluble carbohydrates (ASC) also occurred in this period. As
   Phaeocystis sp. increased, C-14 incorporation into LMWM and
   polysaccharides showed a significant rise. These metabolic patterns were
   consistent with earlier models of the development of Phaeocystis sp.
   blooms. Polysaccharide-carbon concentration, both acid-soluble and
   acid-insoluble, showed dramatic increases during the early stages of the
   bloom. Enhanced polysaccharide synthesis was related to the formation of
   the mucilaginous colonial matrix and is suggested to be a physiological
   strategy tending to increase colony buoyancy. During the decline of the
   Phaeocystis sp. bloom, the proportion of C-14 incorporated into LMWM
   decreased, possibly as a result of disruption of the colonies, whereas
   incorporation into lipids exhibited a consistent increase. The
   accumulation of high-energy storage products is interpreted as a
   metabolic adaptation for overwintering under very low light levels. As a
   consequence of the distinct metabolic patterns of each successional
   stage, the protein-C/acid-insoluble polysaccharide-C ratio showed a
   marked decrease, whereas the relative contribution of ASC-C to the total
   measured carbon displayed a significant increase. In addition, carbon
   incorporation into LMWM also showed a slight but continuous increase. It
   is suggested that the metabolic changes associated with the diatom -
   Phaeocystis sp. succession are in accord with a marked shift in the
   trophic structure of the planktonic ecosystem from the classical food
   chain in the earlier stages, and mainly during the diatom bloom, to a
   preponderance of the microbial loop at the end of the Phaeocystis sp.

Abstract = {{Regulation of a Fucus distichus L. emend, Powell population is probably
   mediated through a density-dependent mortality of the recruits. Blocks
   seeded with different densities of germlings of F. distichus and cleared
   plots with naturally occurring recruits of different densities and with
   artificially thinned densities were used to monitor the effect of
   density on mortality and growth among recruits in a population of F.
   distichus in False Creek, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In the
   first 2 mo of development, germlings on the high density blocks
   experienced a lower mortality than those on the low density blocks. At
   later stages (> 2 mo), the effect of density on mortality was reversed.
   Plants recruited into the cleared plots were > 1 mm in length and they
   also experienced a positive effect of density on mortality. In both the
   density blocks and cleared plots, plant mortality eventually became
   independent of plant density. Plant growth rate was generally not
   related to density but was related to plant size (length). There was a
   large variation in the sizes of the plants. All 3 measures of size
   inequality: zero-centered skewness, coefficient of variation, and Gini
   coefficient are significantly correlated. Plants in both the density
   blocks and cleared plots showed a slight tendency towards a more normal
   or positively skewed size distribution from fall 1986 to spring 1987,
   probably due to an increased mortality of the smaller plants during this
   time. The mechanism of dominance-suppression and difference in the
   intrinsic growth rate or timing of settlement probably all contributed
   to the inequality in size distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence and subsequent survival and growth of five opportunistic
   `'weeds'' were monitored after seed additions to long-term grazing
   treatments with or without current-year grazing, long-term ungrazed
   treatments, and removal treatments designed to eliminate plant
   competition from existing perennials while either leaving vegetation and
   soil structure unaltered or disturbed. The treatments were applied on
   both uplands and lowlands to assess the relative influence of
   macroabiotic environment versus plant competition. The long-term effects
   of large herbivores on the initial emergence of seedlings were greater
   than the effects of removing competition. Very few individuals emerged
   on the long-term grazed treatments that were either grazed or ungrazed
   during the experiment. Numbers of individuals emerging on the long-term
   ungrazed treatments were greater or equal to those emerging on the
   no-competition-undisturbed treatments, but numbers were greatest on
   no-competition-disturbed treatments. None of the seeded individuals on
   the long-term grazed, currently grazed treatments survived to the end of
   the growing season. There was a slightly greater end-of-season biomass
   of seeded species and percentage of the total population reaching
   reproductive status on the long-term ungrazed compared with
   grazed-nondefoliated treatments, and very high survival, biomass, and
   proportions of reproductives on both no-competition treatments. Cover
   types in the immediate vicinity of seedlings influenced both germination
   and survival, but the effects differed between species and treatments.
   Equal compensation tb current-year herbivory occurred on long-term
   heavily grazed treatments even though above-ground production was much
   greater on long-term protected sites. Productivity varied with
   topography, but very few topographic main effects or interactions
   occurred with demographic variables of seeded species, suggesting that
   macroabiotic effects were of minor importance compared with grazing and
   plant competition.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance of moths was monitored with light-traps in two sites in
   southern Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice for 22 years and in Cernis for 9
   years. In these sites, that are vastly different in environmental
   stability and predictability, stability of insect populations was
   studied. The amplitude of fluctuations in abundance of the insect
   populations, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV), varied a
   great deal between species so that there was a large overlap between the
   two sites. Nevertheless there was a highly significant tendency for
   species at Cernis, the more stable site, to have smaller values of CV,
   i.e., to be less fluctuating. Also in species co-occurring in the two
   sites, the CV at Cernis tended to be smaller. Trends in abundance of
   individual species over time, both increases and decreases, were common
   in both sites and did not differ between habitats. Environmental
   stability begets insect population stability in terms of the amplitude
   of the fluctuations, but trends in time occur irrespective of stability
   of the habitat.}},

Abstract = {{To provide more efficient utilization of village wastes and agricultural
   residues and eliminate pollution from current practices anaerobic
   treatment of such wastes with methane recovery is proposed. This paper
   describes studies to determine the performance of anaerobic composting
   for such wastes.
   Composting of three waste types was investigated: (a) agricultural
   residues, (b) Village solid waste and 1:1 mixture of (a) and (b). Three
   150 gallon reactors with periodic leachate recycling were used for
   anaerobic composting while three 50 gallon reactors produced an aerobic
   compost from the same wastes. Reactors were maintained for six months
   simulating the time between growing seasons. Volatile solids destruction
   ranged from 10.3 to 38.7\%. Biogas production was ranged from 1350 to
   1420 1 per k of volatile solids destroyed with a methane content of 55
   to 70\%. Leachate was monitored throughout for: pH, alkalinity, total
   and ammonia nitrogen, COD, TOC, total solids, volatile solids and four
   metals. MPN data was collected for various bacterial groups (total plate
   count, anaerobic cellulose decomposers, and anaerobic acid producers) to
   monitor increases and declines in the leachate bacterial population.
   Physical and chemical testing provided comparisons between finished
   anaerobic compost and aerobic compost from the same three waste samples.}},

   and Erica coccinea L. was monitored after an autumn fire in montane
   fynbos near Stellenbosch in the Cape Province, South Africa.
   Discriminant and correlation analyses were used to determine the
   relationships between measures of pre-fire plant size and vigour, the
   degree of damage caused by the fire, and whether, firstly, plants
   survived the fire itself, and secondly, the survivors survived the
   subsequent summer. Pre-fire plant size was important in predicting
   whether plants survived the fire. Pre-fire plant vigour and the degree
   of damage caused by the fire were important predictors of whether plants
   survived the fire and the subsequent summer. Mortality due to the fire
   and during the following summer was highest for E. coccinea, P.
   mucronata, N. paleacea and B. nodiflora. Seedling recruitment varied

Abstract = {{Coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest provide a unique setting for
   stream ecology research because of the great age of the forests and the
   important role of wood debris in structuring aquatic systems. The
   composition and diversity of the insect community in Mack Creek, a
   stream in a 450 yr conifer forest, was compared with that in Grasshopper
   Creek where it flowed through a recent clearcut, and at Quartz Creek,
   which had a 40 yr deciduous canopy. Of the 256 taxa identified, Mack
   Creek had the highest species richness (196) and evenness. The open site
   had 191 taxa but high dominance of a few grazer taxa. The
   deciduous-canopy site had 165 taxa with abundant detritivores. Despite
   differences in density, the biomass of emergence was similar at the
   three sites, ranging from 1.53 to 1.65 g m-2 yr-1.
   The importance of disturbance in structuring stream communities was
   demonstrated in phenomenological studies after a debris torrent at
   Quartz Creek, and by monitoring stream recovery following the eruption
   of Mt. St. Helens in 1980. At Quartz Creek, the debris torrent
   eliminated the fauna from a 300 m reach, but there was rapid recovery.
   Emergence density in the same year was similar to that of the control
   site. The major shift in populations was a decrease in detritivores and
   moss associates and an increase in grazers, especially Baetis mayflies.
   At Ape Creek on Mt. St. Helens, over 200 taxa were recorded by 1987 but
   most occurred in very low densities. This site is reset by winter
   freshets and by infilling with glacial fines in the summer so the fauna
   continues to be dominated by weedy, or early successional species. At
   Clearwater Creek, the presence of wood debris as a stable substrate and
   limited inputs of fine sediment after 1980 have hastened population
   recovery. A decade after the eruption this site can be characterized as
   being in the mid-stages of succession with high insect productivity from
   an algal-based food web. With further growth of the riparian vegetation
   I predict a shift towards a detritus-based food web and fauna more
   similar to Mack Creek than it is at present.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the development of numerous national exposure-related databases,
   exposure assessment remains a weak link in the chain of risk assessment
   and risk-management activities. Most databases include measures of
   environmental releases or concentrations of pollutants in specific
   media, but do not include actual measures of exposure. if accurate
   estimates of exposure experienced by populations or individuals are
   absent, it is impossible to judge the effectiveness of risk-management
   strategies. The Risk Management Work Group evaluation identified the
   following needs: refinement of measurements of total exposure
   experienced by individuals, improved characterization of the
   distribution of exposures in the population, longitudinal monitoring of
   exposure trends, and improved information about the public health
   implications of exposure. Recommendations are presented with the hope
   that the utility of existing databases will be improved and that future
   initiatives will be developed that meet the needs of risk management.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure databases are useful for monitoring status and trends in
   environmental health. However, other supporting data are usually needed
   to infer human exposure or internal dose. Program planning and
   evaluation, environmental health surveillance, epidemiologic research,
   and contributions to international efforts are four major purposes for
   monitoring environmental exposure status and trends. Although databases
   play an important role in monitoring human exposure, certain
   methodological problems need to be overcome. The work group developed
   six criteria for meeting information needs for human exposure
   assessment. Areas that need attention are (1) specification of location,
   (2) specification of facility and chemical identifiers, (3)
   documentation of special populations at risk, (4) provision of early
   warning of new problems, (5) monitoring changes over time, and (6)
   enhancement of documentation. We tested these criteria by examining six
   available databases that might be used for monitoring exposure to
   contaminants in drinking water. Available data fell short of information
   needs. We drew four conclusions and offered several recommendations for
   each. First, available data systems lack adequate measures of human
   exposure. Second, data for monitoring exposures for many important
   population subgroups and environmental settings are inadequate. Third,
   an `'early warning'' system that monitors human exposures is needed.
   Fourth, designers of data-collection systems should consider the needs
   of users who monitor status and trends of human exposure.}},

   in Glacier National Park for bear tracks and scats during five

   Specifically, we explored the power of bear sign surveys to detect a

Abstract = {{(1) In natural populations, colonies of bumble bees vary in many
   important life history traits, such as colony size and age at maturity,
   or the number and sex of reproductives produced. We investigated how the
   presence of parasites in field populations of the bumble bee Bombus
   lucorum L. relates to variation in life history traits and reproductive
   performance. A total of thirty-six colonies was placed in accessible
   nest sites in the field and monitored at regular intervals throughout a
   season. (2) Among the life history correlates, early nest foundation was
   strongly associated with large maximum colony size, old age and large
   size at maturity, and this in turn with successful production of males
   and queens, as well as with the number of sexuals produced. Overall,
   reproductive success was highly skewed with only five colonies producing
   all the queens. Sixteen colonies failed to reproduce altogether. (3) The
   social parasite Psithyrus was abundant early in the Bombus colony cycle
   and preferentially invaded host nests with many first brood workers and
   thus disproportionately large size, i.e. those colonies that would
   otherwise be more likely to reproduce or produce (daughter) queens
   rather than males. To prevent nest loss, Psithyrus had to be removed
   soon after invasion. Therefore, the effects reported here can only be
   crude estimates. (4) Parasitoid conopid flies are likely to cause heavy
   worker mortality when sexuals are reared by the colonies. Their inferred
   effect was a reduction in biomass that could be invested in sexuals as
   well as a shift in the sex ratio at the population level resulting from
   failure to produce queens. We suggest to group the inferred correlates
   into `early events' surrounding colony initiation and social parasitism,
   and `late events' surrounding attained colony size in summer and
   parasitism by conopid flies. Our evidence thus provides a heuristic
   approach to understand the factors that affect reproductive success of
   Bombus colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Several genes involved in the metabolism of carcinogens have been found
   to be polymorphic in human populations and are associated with increased
   risk of cancer at some sites. This study focuses on the Polymorphic
   enzyme glutathione transferase mu (GT mu). Smokers with low lymphocyte
   GT mu activity are at an approximately 2-fold higher risk for lung
   cancer and an approximately 3-fold higher risk for stomach and colon
   adenocarcinomas. Recent cloning and sequencing of the GST1 gene has
   allowed the development of convenient genotyping methods based on
   restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) or the polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR). The GST1 polymorphism has been shown to be a deletion of
   the gene locus. To detect the presence or absence of the gene we
   amplified exons 1-5 and/or exons 6-7 of the GST1 gene by PCR. PCR
   amplification produced bands of 215-bp or 273-bp from individuals with
   one or two copies of the GST1 allele and no band if the individual was
   homozygously deleted (0/0). In the exon 6-7 PCR, we co-amplified a
   268-bp portion of the beta-globin gene as an internal reference standard
   for quantitative analysis of product yield. This allowed homozygote
   individuals (+/+) to be distinguished from heterozygotes (+/0).
   We have compared the GST1 genotype to lymphocyte GT mu activity measured
   on trans-stilbene oxide (TSO) in the lymphocytes of 45 individuals. Low
   GT mu activity (< 67 pmole/min/10(7) cells) was strongly associated
   (24/24) with the GST1 0/0 genotype. With the exception of one
   individual, activities greater than 67 pmole/min/10(7) were associated
   with the presence of the GST1 allele (20/21). Individuals with the
   highest GT-TSO activity were found to be homozygous for GST1 (+/+),
   while heterozygotes (+/0) generally had lower activity, suggesting a
   gene dosage effect in lymphocytes. The allele distribution among four
   sampled populations varied considerably. In a North Carolina population,
   51\% (65/127) were GST1 0/0, and this finding is consistent with those
   of other studies based on phenotypic analysis. In three smaller cohorts,
   the GST1 0/0 genotype was observed to occur in: 30\% (14/47) of Finnish
   foundry workers, 33\% (18/54) of Georgia dye workers, and 62\% (74/120)
   of Taiwanese placental samples. In the future, we shall investigate the
   mechanistic link between polymorphisms in carcinogen metabolism genes
   and interindividual variation in measures of DNA damage, such as DNA
   adducts and hprt mutation frequency.}},

Abstract = {{One of the potential human health effects associated with the
   environmental release of microorganisms is colonization of the
   intestinal tract. This study uses serial transfer techniques to monitor
   the in vitro survival and competition with human fecal microbiota of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains BC16 and AC869. Strain BC16 was isolated
   from a commercial product for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)
   degradation, and AC869 is a 3,5-dichlorobenzoate degrader. In addition,
   a mouse intestinal isolate, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAMG, was
   studied as a positive control.
   Results were compared to previously published mouse fecal microbiota
   studies. Quantitative comparison of the fecal microbiota populations
   enumerated on selective media found human and mouse cultures to be
   nearly identical. Survival of the competitor strains was also similar in
   both the human and the mouse systems. By culture 5 of the human serial
   transfer experiments, strains AC869 and PAMG were present at
   significantly higher levels than strain BC16. In previous serial
   transfer experiments with mouse fecal flora, strain AC869 was present at
   a higher level than strains PAMG and BC16 by culture 5. No alterations
   of the microbiota populations due to the addition of a competitor strain
   were found. This system can be helpful in identifying environmental
   strains with a high potential for colonizing the intestinal tract.}},

Abstract = {{Gliricidia sepium and G. maculata are multi-purpose leguminous trees
   native to Central America and Mexico. Research programmes have been
   initiated to define the native distribution of Gliricidia and sample the
   spectrum of genetic variation. To date, there has been little systematic
   assessment of genetic variability in multi-purpose tree species.
   Accurate estimates of diversity between- and within-populations are
   considered a prerequisite for the optimization of sampling and breeding
   strategies. We have used a PCR-based polymorphic assay procedure (RAPDs)
   to monitor genetic variability in Gliricidia. Extensive genetic
   variability was detected between species and the variability was
   partitioned into between- and within-population components. On average,
   most (60 per cent) of the variation occurs between G. sepium populations
   but oligonucleotide primers differed in their capacity to detect
   variability between and within populations. Population-specific genetic
   markers were identified. RAPDs provide a cost-effective method for the
   precise and routine evaluation of variability and may be used to
   identify areas of maximum diversity. The approaches outlined have
   general applicability to a range of organisms and are discussed in
   relation to the exploitation of multi-purpose tree species of the
   tropics.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle are selective foragers in response to several plant attributes.
   We tested hypotheses that caespitose plants of various basal areas were
   equally susceptible to herbivory and were defoliated with equal
   intensity by cattle. Five-hundred crested wheatgrass (Agropryon
   desertorum (Fischer ex Link) Schultes) plants, distributed among 10
   basal area classes, were monitored for frequency and level of
   utilization after approximately 74\% of all plants in pastures were
   grazed by cattle. Plants with <25-cm2 basal area were less likely, and
   plants between 65 and 105-cm2 more likely to be grazed than other
   classes. Ninety-one percent of the 65 to 85-cm2 basal ares plants were
   defoliated, while only 48\% of those <2.5 cm2 were grazed. The fact that
   mid-size plants occurred least often but were defoliated most often
   lends further credence to the selective grazing hypothesis. Less
   frequent use by cattle of plants <25-cm2 basal area may enhance chances
   of seedling establishment and survival of smaller established plants or
   remnants of deteriorating tufts. Among grazed plants, however, smaller
   plants endured higher utilization by weight than the overall population.
   Utilization was equal among other size classes. Because forage yield per
   unit of basal area declined as plant size increased, cattle probably
   forage most efficiently by selecting bite-size plants. Researchers using
   single plants, tiller, or leaves as experimental units should note that
   varying sized tufts are not equally likely to be defoliated, and plants
   less than 25-cm2 basal area may receive greater than average levels of
   utilization from free-ranging cattle under light to moderate utilization
   levels. These aspects of livestock grazing behavior and research
   objectives should be considered in selection of experimental units.}},

Abstract = {{Resting eggs of Acartia spp. (presumably A. bifilosa Giesbr.) at
   densities between 65 and 125 eggs cm-2 were found in sediment off the
   southern coast of Finland and represent the first observations of
   dormant calanoid eggs in the Baltic Sea. The highest egg densities were
   found at sediment depths between 4 and 8 cm. The hatching percentage
   varied between 0 and 90\% in the different sediment layers and at
   different experimental temperatures (13, 16 and 19-degrees-C). Some
   nauplii emerged from the eggs extracted from sediment layers 9 to 10 cm
   beneath the surface layer and other nauplii emerged from eggs after 82 d
   of dark storage at 3-degrees-C. Light was not needed to trigger
   hatching; the nauplii were able to hatch in darkness when the eggs were
   resuspended in filtered seawater. Indirect evidence suggests that the
   marked spring peak of Acartia spp. nauplii seen in a monitoring data
   from the years 1973 to 1984 was derived from benthic eggs and not from
   spawning. The possible mechanisms for induction of hatching and the
   adaptive benefits of resting egg production for A. bifilosa are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the resource basis and energy budget of migrating knots
   Calidris canutus on spring stopover in NW Iceland. where large
   concentrations of birds deposit extensive fuel reserves for long
   distance flights to high arctic breeding grounds. Prey composition was
   determined on the basis of crushed shell and other fragments in faecal
   droppings. The daily foraging time, and dropping frequency, in two main
   intertidal habitats - seaweed beds on rocky shores and mudflats - was
   monitored in relation to the tidal cycle.
   Main food sources were 4-15 mm periwinkles Littorina spp. (providing 147
   kJ of daily gross energy intake) taken from seaweed, and 8-23 mm common
   mussels Mytilus edulis (134 kJ), taken from both seaweed and mud.
   Additional contributions obtained froin mud include chironomid larvae (9
   kJ), small gastropods (3 kJ) and probably also unidentified softbodied
   prey (about 73 kJ). Food resources at the stopover site are probably not
   limiting for the population of migrating knots. Estimated seasonal prey
   depletion rates were low, only 1-4\% for Littorina, 0.5-1.7\% for
   Mytilus and 11\% for chironomid larvae.
   The knots' estimated daily energy intake was below the predicted limit
   for maximum metabolisable energy intake. Although this indicates that
   the knots' rate of fuel deposition probably was constrained by food
   availability and foraging time rather than the metabolic capacity, it
   could not be ruled out that the knots at least on some days reach their
   metabolic ceiling for energy accumulation.
   A combination of factors may explain why the study region offers highly
   favourable stopover conditions for transient knots, and why the surplus
   of resources are not exploited instead for breeding or winter survival
   by resident shorebirds: (a) macrotidal variation; (b) pronounced
   seasonality; (c) combined exploitation of different intertidal habitats
   (seaweed and mud) during different tidal phases; (d) exuberant food
   availability. The shore crab and limpet are absent from the study
   region, which may explain the unusually high Littorina densities as a
   result of significant release from predation and competition,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal chironomid emergence was monitored in the shallow eutrophic
   Lake Kasumigaura and 18 species were collected with a battery-operated
   light trap fixed on a floating stage and with surface emergence traps.
   During October-December, samples in the light trap comprised exclusively
   Tokunagayusurika akamusi (Tokunaga) and small numbers of one or two
   other species. T. akamusi, Procladuis (Holotanypus) culiciformis (L.),
   and Chironomus plumosus (L.) constituted 91.6 \% of the annual catch of
   chironomid adults. The predominance of T. akamusi (7 5.3 \% of
   chironomid catch) and the high ratio (13) of T. akamusi to C plumosus
   was more marked in this lake than other Japanese eutrophic lakes.
   Glyptotendipes tokunagai Sasa and Dicrotendipes pelochloris (Kieffer)
   were also caught abundantly with the light trap, but not with surface
   traps, indicating these were littoral species. The dry weight of
   emerging adults during May-December 1982 was 2.87 g m-2, of which 1.92 
   g m-2 (67 \%) was T. akamusi and 0.67 g m-2 (23 \%) C. plumosus and 0.23
   g m-2 (8 \%) Clinotanypus sugiyamai Tokunaga and 0.03 g m-2 (1 \%) P.
   (H.) culiciformis. The weight of emerging Tanypodinae was much higher
   than the annual mean larval biomass or estimated larval production,
   which have been due to underestimating the population density using an
   Ekman-Birge dredge. High numbers of individuals and species of
   chironomids were caught during April-July, presumably as a result of the
   high food supply for chironomid communities.}},

Abstract = {{The annual dynamics of the phototrophic bacterial populations developing
   in the anoxic layers has been monitored in three basins of the northern
   area of Lake Banyoles (Spain). Although two of the studied basins are
   meromictic and one is holomictic, chemical properties of the water are
   almost identical. Therefore, differences in both the spatial and
   temporal distribution, as well as in the composition of phototrophic
   bacterial communities, dominated by Chlorobium phaeobacteroides and
   Chromatium minus, are discussed on the basis of the structural and
   morphometric characteristics of each basin. Both species showed the same
   physiological adaptations to light intensity changes by modifying the
   carotenoid/bacteriochlorophyll ratio. Light reaching the oxic-anoxic
   boundary appears to be the most important factor controlling the growth
   of phototrophic bacteria in Lake Banyoles. The oxic-anoxic boundary
   becomes shallower as summer advances, until enough light is available
   for bacterial photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in a grayling spawning population are described that occurred in
   relation to both natural and man-induced events. The spawning population
   was monitored from 1982 to 1987 with a trap on a fishway on the
   Beaverlodge River, Alberta. Most of the spawning run in each year was
   tagged with recapture noted in subsequent years. Male grayling grew
   slightly faster than females. Growth rates were variable and appeared to
   be quite low in years of low water flow. Grayling first spawned at 2 to
   6 years of age. The majority of tagged grayling would have returned to
   spawn a second time after a delay of one to two years were it not for
   the high adult mortality. It is hypothesized that the variable time to
   first maturity and the delay in the second spawning is a response to
   highly variable juvenile recruitment. Annual mortality rates increased
   with age, suggesting an increased vulnerability of larger fish to
   angling. The population appears highly sensitive to over-exploitation,
   because of the high mortality rates and the delayed time to spawning of
   the adults.}},

Abstract = {{In population models, omnivorous predation (i.e., predation on > 1
   trophic level) generally has a destabilizing influence, whereas habitat
   heterogeneity tends to stabilize both predatory and competitive
   interactions. I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native
   omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the
   structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch
   (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low
   and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged
   vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size
   structure, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored
   over a 2-mo summer period.
   Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except
   molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost
   exclusively during the whole experiment, whereas in the absence of
   vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of
   microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the
   abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria
   (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both
   vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the
   biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation
   increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the
   negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a
   negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan
   macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan
   herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had
   an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of
   only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation
   had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all
   macroinvertebrates.
   The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory
   invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were
   responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have
   affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through
   direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate
   predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on
   nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex interactions between the
   omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species
   (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the
   relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The
   reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and
   the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory
   invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large
   predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that
   relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the
   littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory
   invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics
   of littoral than of pelagic communities.}},

Abstract = {{I tested the hypothesis that phytophagous insect species compete
   interspecifically on shared host plants by inducing chemical, physical,
   and phenological changes in the plant that either directly reduce insect
   growth and survival or indirectly alter attack by natural enemies. I
   manipulated levels of simulated folivory on branches within eight trees
   of Quercus emoryi in a complete randomized block design. Survival and
   causes of mortality, including attack by natural enemies, of a dominant
   leafminer, Cameraria sp. nov., were monitored over two growing seasons.
   Survival varied significantly among trees but not among treatments.
   Causes of mortality also varied significantly among trees. Death from
   premature leaf abscission increased significantly with increasing levels
   of branch damage, while mortality from other causes, including death
   from bacterial and fungal attack, declined significantly with increasing
   levels of damage. However, neither of these changes in mortality was
   sufficient to cause changes in overall survival. Leaf damage did not
   influence attack by macroscopic natural enemies (hymenopteran
   parasitoids or vertebrate and invertebrate predators). By far, the most
   important factor affecting survival and causes of mortality within trees
   was the presence of co-occurring larvae on leaves (i.e., intraspecific
   competition).
   Simulated folivory in the first growing season did not affect folivory
   by Cameraria or other folivorous arthropods in the next season.
   Colonization, survival, rate of attack by natural enemies, and amount of
   herbivory by other arthropods in the second growing season were not
   affected by levels of leaf damage in the first one. Neither survival nor
   causes of mortality of Cameraria in the second growing season were
   associated with folivory by endemic leafchewing arthropods. Simulated
   folivory in the first growing season did, however, reduce leaf
   production in the second season.
   These results do not support the hypothesis that insect species compete
   interspecifically via induced plant responses and their effects on the
   third trophic level (natural enemies of the herbivores). The effects of
   simulated (first growing season) and insect (second growing season)
   folivory via induced plant responses on the Cameraria population was
   negligible relative to intraspecific interactions. Further, my results
   do not support the notion that folivore-induced responses are defensive
   and that plants have evolved these responses to manipulate the third
   trophic level. In natural settings, other factors that influence
   population dynamics of phytophagous insects, such as intraspecific
   competition and interactions with microparasites, may obscure any
   negative effects of herbivore-induced plant responses on interactions
   among herbivore species and their macroscopic natural enemies.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality due to retention of lobsters in derelict traps was evaluated
   over a 2-year period using two approaches. First, a string of eight
   empty, single-chamber, plastic traps was deployed at 40 m depth off
   Oahu, Hawaii, and monitored periodically by scuba during a 6-month
   period in 1990. The traps were stable and remained intact despite
   adverse oceanic conditions. Numerous entries and exits of lobsters were
   recorded. For the second test, the ability of lobsters to exit traps was
   tested in a series of field and laboratory trials of trap strings
   stocked with Hawaiian spiny lobster Panulirus marginatus and slipper
   lobster Scyllarides squammosus. The number of lobsters that died in
   stocked traps was less than 4\% of the test population and differed
   significantly from zero only in the laboratory evaluation (chi2 5.42, P
   0.02). The two species exited similarly; however, the pattern of exits
   in laboratory and field tests differed significantly (chi2 23.889, P
   0.03). All lobsters exited within 56 days in a pattern generally
   approximating an exponential decline. Our evidence suggests that little
   direct mortality of lobsters is due to the inability to exit traps, and
   consequently ghost fishing by these traps is not considered a problem
   for spiny and slipper lobsters.}},

Abstract = {{Chrysophtharta bimaculata is the most economically important pest of
   eucalypt forests in Tasmania causing severe growth losses in plantations
   and seeded stands of the major commercial eucalypt species. An
   integrated pest management (IPM) strategy has been developed which
   allows peak activity of the natural enemies of C. bimaculata and
   monitors pest egg and larval populations before significant defoliation
   takes place. The relationship between beetle population level and degree
   of defoliation is quantified by regression models which are used to
   identify potentially damaging populations and the need for additional
   artificial control measures. The biotic insecticide, Bacillus
   thuringiensis var. tenebrionis was successfully tested against C.
   bimaculata larvae, and the use of B. thuringiensis and the synthetic
   pyrethroid, cypermethrin, in the IPM strategy is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater associated with the
   application of nitrogen fertilizers have led to inquiries concerning the
   fate of nitrate beneath agricultural fields. This study was conducted to
   identify the processes affecting the distribution of nitrate in the
   unsaturated and saturated zones beneath an agricultural field and to
   assess how each process is influenced by factors associated with slope
   position. Nested piezometers were installed at two slope positions at
   the study site in southeastern Washington, U.S.A. Unsaturated- and
   saturated-zone sediment cores were analyzed for water content, pH, total
   and soluble organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, and denitrification
   potential. Waters from the piezometers showed decreasing nitrate
   concentrations with depth below the water table. Trends in measured
   parameters indicated depth intervals where the distribution of nitrate
   could be attributed either solely to transport or to a combination of
   transport and biological denitrification. Denitrification explained the
   distribution of nitrate in the root zone while transport explained the
   interval between the root zone and the water table. There was a higher
   potential for denitrification below the water table at the bottom slope
   than at the top slope. Factors associated with slope position, such as a
   shallow water table and impeding stratigraphic layers, may explain this
   higher potential.
   Regardless of slope position, comparing nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide
   production from nitrate- and carbon-amended or -unamended samples
   indicated that denitrifier populations present in high-potential zones
   arc nitrate-limited. Results from spherical microsite modelling suggest
   that anoxic conditions are possible in the bulk sediment despite the
   presence of oxygenated groundwaters beneath both slope positions.
   Advective-dispersive transport will continue to transport nitrate
   through the unsaturated and saturated zones. The data from this study
   suggest that there is greater potential for nitrate attenuation by
   denitrification beneath the bottom slope than the top slope. The data
   also show that large masses of nitrate reside in deep subsoil vadose
   zones. These regions must therefore be monitored to detect threats to
   future groundwater quality.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), were
   monitored by capturing adults with hand nets from rotted liver set on
   the ground. Adults were marked and released. During the 61-d study
   conducted in a tropical dry forest in the dry season January to March
   1989), 2,640 individual females and 460 individual males were recorded
   at the four liver-baited stations. The total number of visits by females
   was 5,769 and by males 510. The mean number of unmarked adults per day
   was 44.1 females and 7.6 males in an area of almost-equal-to 2.59 km2.
   The mean percentage of marked flies that were recovered was 64.3\%. The
   mean number of feeding stations visited, times recaptured, and days in
   the study area by individual females was 2.1, 2.4, and 4.5,
   respectively. Daily visitational patterns by both sexes at the feeding
   stations were bimodal with peaks occurring between the hours of 0730 to
   0859 and 1500 to 1629. Flies were most active when the mean temperature
   was 29.8-degrees-C; the majority of the visits occurred when air
   temperatures were between 26 and 33-degrees-C. Most females attracted to
   feeding stations were nulliparous (70.7\%) and mated (69.7\%). Our
   results suggest that observing adults at feeding stations is a reliable
   method of obtaining data on the behavior and population dynamics of
   indigenous populations of screwworm adults in tropical habitats.
   Although this method was labor intensive, the amount of data gleaned
   from the manipulation of wild populations more than compensated for such
   costs.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted in commercial greenhouses to examine seasonal
   population dynamics of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis
   (Pergande) on two crops: bell peppers, Capsicum annuum (L.) and long
   English cucumbers, Cucumis sativus (L.). Yellow sticky traps were used
   to monitor density and sex ratio of the dispersing adult population.
   Leaf and flower samples were taken to determine the spatial distribution
   of adults and larvae, and to investigate the relationship between trap
   catch and density of F. occidentalis on the plants. Trap catch peaked at
   different times during the growing season in each greenhouse. As trap
   catch increased, numbers of F. occidentalis adults and immatures on
   flowers and leaves also increased. On both crops, the majority (84-95\%)
   of adults in flowers were females. Greater than 85\% of larvae were
   found on leaves. Adult male F. occidentalis were rarely found on plants,
   even when traps were catching high numbers. Female F. occidentalis were
   always found in flowers before they were found on leaves and were found
   on sticky traps only when the thrips population started to increase.
   Used together, sticky traps and flower monitoring allow quick detection
   of potential ``hot spots{''} of thrips activity. Control measures can be
   applied immediately on a local rather than grand scale. Introductions of
   the predatory mite Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) did not control the
   thrips population in most of the greenhouses monitored. However, the
   minute pirate bug, Orius tristicolor (White), shows promise for future
   use as an effective biological control agent in commercial vegetable
   greenhouses.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a multi-year study of air pollution and respiratory hospital
   admissions in the Buffalo, Albany, and New York City, New York,
   metropolitan areas, filter samples were collected daily at suburban air
   monitoring sites and analyzed for their content of particulate phase
   aerosol strong acidity (i.e., hydrogen ion, H+) and sulfate (SO4=). In
   addition, daily hospital admissions for respiratory causes, other
   community air pollutant measurements (e.g., ozone, O3), and
   meteorological data (e.g., temperature) were also obtained for these
   metropolitan areas. The summer months (June-August) were selected for
   analysis because that is when the highest H+ (and O3) are usually
   experienced at these sites, and because these months are rarely
   complicated by other major influences (e.g., high pollen counts). Thus,
   any pollution-admissions relationships were expected to be most clearly
   discernible in this season. Prior to the health effects analysis, the
   summer admissions and environmental data were first detrended to
   eliminate long-wave autocorrelations, and day-of-week effects were
   removed via regression.
   Cross-correlations of the filtered 1988 and 1989 admissions and
   environmental data revealed strong associations between elevated summer
   haze pollution (i.e., H+, SO4=, and O3) and increased total respiratory
   and asthma admissions on the same day and/or on subsequent days in
   Buffalo and New York City, especially during the summer of 1988 (when
   pollution levels were more extreme). Regression analyses indicated that
   the pollution-admissions associations remained significant (p<0.05) even
   after the simultaneous inclusion of lagged daily maximum temperature.
   Mean effects calculations for these cities indicated that summertime
   haze can play a significant role in the occurrence of respiratory
   admissions in that season: accounting for an average 6 to 24\% of 1988
   Buffalo and NYC asthma admissions (depending on the pollutant index
   employed). O3 consistently had the highest mean effects estimates.
   Relative risk (RR) calculations indicated that the risk of admission for
   asthma was increased by a factor of 1.19 to 1.43 in these cities on
   maximum 1988 summertime pollution days, with H+ consistently having the
   highest RR estimates. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
   that ambient acid aerosol peaks (eg., H+ greater-than-or-equal-to 100
   nmol/m3) can potentiate the respiratory disease effects of O3.
   Associations were weaker in the less urbanized Albany metropolitan area
   and in the New York City (NYC) suburbs, even though the NYC suburban O3
   exposures were similar to (and the H+ concentrations may even be
   somewhat higher than) those in the center city. Examination of census
   data regarding the prevalence of poverty in these various areas
   suggested that localities having the highest percentages of the
   underprivileged in their urban cores are those in which the adverse
   effects of air pollution are most likely to result in hospital
   admissions for respiratory causes. This may reflect racial differences
   in pollution response, inadequate health care (e.g., due lo lack of
   insurance), poor nutrition, or some, as yet unidentified, factor
   associated with high population density. The reason(s) for the
   apparently higher urban core associations between air pollution and
   respiratory hospital admissions will be investigated further in future
   analyses of these data.}},

   success. However, such an association has never been demonstrated
   conclusively in wildlife populations. From 7 December 1987 to 15 April
   1988 we monitored survival of 101 wild mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus)
   fawns in 2 fenced pastures, and determined levels of cortisol :
   creatinine and urea nitrogen : creatinine ratios in urine of 14 tame
   yearling mule deer using the same ranges. The 2 pastures were stocked
   with deer in November-December 1987 at high (0.66 km2; 41 adults, 50
   fawns, 7 tame yearlings; 148 deer/km2) and low (1.69 km2; 29 adults, 51
   fawns, 7 tame yearlings; 51 deer/km2) density. Mean weekly cortisol:
   creatinine and urea nitrogen : creatinine ratios were associated with
   weekly fawn survival only in the high density pasture. Cortisol:
   creatinine also accounted for the effects of initial population density.
   Urinary cortisol: creatinine has the best potential as an indicator of
   condition in mule deer, but more research is needed before it can be
   considered a reliable tool for assessing population condition.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the economic and sampling efficiency of potential monitoring
   programs is a first step in validation. Thus, we established a system of
   nest boxes in the Payette National Forest to evaluate the feasibility of
   using a system of nest boxes to monitor response of boreal owl (Aegolius
   funereus) populations to habitat change. We recorded nest site occupancy
   and productivity as measures of foraging habitat trend. Using monitoring
   results from 3 years, we evaluated alternative survey sampling
   techniques for occupancy and determined sample sizes necessary to
   estimate occupancy and clutch size within specified relative bounds. We
   also examined the cost of establishing a nest box system and monitoring
   nest box use. At extremely low nest box occupancy (1\%), sample sizes
   necessary to monitor trend would be extreme (1,909 boxes for 50\%
   relative bound), but sample size is not restrictive when occupancy rates
   exceed 7\% (330 boxes to achieve a 40\% relative bound). Monitoring
   clutch size as a measure of productivity would require a smaller effort
   to achieve tighter relative bounds. Assumptions relating demographic
   parameters to habitat change still must be tested before nest boxes can
   be considered the optimum tool to monitor boreal owl response to habitat
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling inadequacies and an inability to distinguish age classes have
   limited our knowledge of octopus biology in nature. Using an artificial
   shelter sampling technique (Voight, 1988a), and defining mature males by
   the presence of enlarged suckers (Voight, In press), an intertidal
   population of Octopus digueti was monitored for one year.
   In total, 803 octopuses were narcotized; the mass, sex, arm injuries and
   reproductive condition of each octopus were recorded. Captures were more
   frequent in lower intertidal areas offering higher shelter availability
   and a more moderate environment. Capture rates, assumed to indicate
   octopus movement, correlated with sea temperature except during full
   moon periods when they were reduced. Over 26\% of the octopuses handled
   had damaged arms or arm tips, with dorsal arm pairs more often injured.
   The overall sex ratio was significantly male biased, probably due to
   maturity-linked mobility differences between the sexes.
   Reproduction occurred throughout the year; reproductively competent
   adults, brooding females and juveniles were present every month.
   However, annual temperature oscillations synchronize spring hatching of
   eggs spawned from winter to early spring, creating a clear spring
   cohort. Growth and age at maturity of males in the spring and autumn
   cohorts were estimated. Variance was too high for these parameters to be
   estimated in the winter cohort. Growth rates of males over 12 weeks of
   age did not differ from those reported in laboratory rearing studies.
   Estimated average age at maturity ranged from 20 to 32 weeks, depending
   on temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Phytomyza ilicicola is a specialist herbivore. the larvae of which mine,
   and the adults of which feed and oviposit on the developing leaves of
   American Holly, Ilex opaca. Adult Phytomyza have been shown to
   discriminate among host plants on the basis of several host and habitat
   factors. Such discrimination may explain, in part, the observed density
   variation of larval Phytomyza among individual trees and between forest
   and suburban habitats. In order for discrimination to influence density,
   adult Phytomyza must be sufficiently vagile to move among habitats and
   to encounter many hosts. We experimentally monitored the movement ot'
   adults to ask if this were so. In addition we asked whether inter-host
   movements were altered by resource concentration, and whether vagility
   offered an escape from parasitism. To answer these questions, three
   isolated holly trees to serve as colonization sources were selected in
   early spring, prior to adult emergence. Potted target trees were then
   placed singly and in groups of four at 3 compass directions around and
   at 3 different distances (10, 25, and 50 m) from each of the source
   trees. Six weeks after exposure to adult Phytomyza, the number of
   feeding punctures and first instar larvae were counted. Clones were then
   overwintered in cold frames and in early spring, just prior to adult
   emergence, all pupae were examined for parasitism by the dominant
   parasitoid Opius striatriventris. Feeding and parasitism were similar at
   all 3 distances from the source trees, indicating that Opius was at
   least as vagile as Phytomyza. However, first instar larvae decreased
   with distance. There was no evidence that resource concentration
   affected adult movement. Our results suggest that Phytomyza are
   sufficiently vagile to choose among hosts within and between habitats.
   However, movement does not translate into equally high oviposition at
   all distances from a source, nor does it provide an escape from
   parasitism by Opius.}},

Abstract = {{In the Chihuahuan Desert of southeastern Arizona, we monitored the
   responses of three seasonal classes of annual plants (winter, summer and
   biseasonal species) to experimental removal of seed-eating rodents and
   ants over a ten-year period (1978 through 1987).
   Rodent removal led to increased dominance of the winter annual flora by
   initially rare, but competitively superior, large-seeded annuals. The
   greater densities of these plants eventually suppressed populations of
   small-seeded annuals. In contrast, ant removal produced higher densities
   of small-seeded species, whose increases had no measurable effect on
   populations of large-seeded winter annuals. Competition between
   large-seeded and small-seeded winter annuals is highly asymmetric and
   consistently favors species with greater seed reserves. As selective
   predators of large-seeds, rodents behave as keystone consumers,
   differentially suppressing the dominant competitors and helping to
   maintain the diversity of winter annuals.
   The population dynamics of winter and summer annuals were linked through
   interactions with biseasonal annuals early in the study but not in later
   years when densities of the biseasonal annuals declined sharply in
   response to summer droughts. Nevertheless, the periodic abundance of
   biseasonal annuals (and some herbaceous perennials) during germination
   of summer annuals might help to explain the insignificance of
   large-seeded annuals in the summer flora. Large-seeded summer annuals
   were rare and showed little response to rodent removal, and both rodents
   and ants used the seeds of small-seeded summer plants. Although rodent
   predation on winter annuals may facilitate harvester ants indirectly by
   increasing the availability of small seeds, ants and rodents appear to
   compete exploitatively through populations of summer annuals. The
   conflicting influence of rodents on ant populations through the two
   seasonal classes of annuals may help to explain why ant populations have
   shown little response to rodent removal during the ten-year experiment.
   Results here contrast with earlier experiments in the Sonoran Desert,
   where ants and rodents interacted principally through populations of
   winter annuals, and increasing dominance of large-seeded annuals on
   rodent-removal plots eventually led ant populations to decline. However,
   the climatic and biotic differences between the Sonoran and Chihuahuan
   Deserts fail to mask the importance of rodents as keystone consumers of
   winter annuals. This strong indirect pathway is the most prominent
   feature of consumer-resource interactions in these deserts.}},

Abstract = {{Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth., a parasitic weed of grasses, causes
   major yield reductions in the principal cereal crops of semi-arid
   Africa. Cultivar resistance is the most economic control measure, since
   adapted, resistant cultivars can be grown without additional input from
   the subsistence farmer. Information on the genetics of resistance to S.
   hermonthica is scant. This is partially attributable to the rarity of
   germplasms which exhibit stable resistance across geographical regions.
   The objective of this study was to determine if the stable resistance
   observed in sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] cultivar SRN39 is
   heritable. Crosses were made between SRN39 and a susceptible parent,
   P954063. Parental, F1, F2 and backcross generations were grown in
   infested pots and development of both host and parasite was monitored.
   Significant variation among genotypes was observed for both host traits
   and effects on parasite populations. The F1 did not differ significantly
   in Striga resistance from the susceptible parent, suggesting recessive
   inheritance. However, hybrid vigor was exhibited by the F1 which yielded
   and developed as well as the resistant parent. Broad sense heritability
   ranged from 0.23 to 0.55 for host traits and from 0.10 to 0.43 for
   effect of genotypes on the Striga population. Joint scaling tests showed
   that observed variation in each host or parasite trait consisted of
   additive and dominance components, suggesting possible progress could be
   made with appropriate selection schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Population dynamics of Phytophthora capsici were monitored in
   artificially infested plots in fields planted with bell peppers
   (Capsicum annuum). Plots were drip-irrigated on either a more frequent
   (three times per week) or a less frequent (one or two times after
   infestation) schedule and were infested with one of three levels of
   inoculum or left uninfested. Pathogen population densities increased and
   then decreased over time in each field. In a field with moderate
   rainfall, plots had population densities of 0, 5, 18, and 41 cfu/g of
   dry soil at the time of infestation. Population densities were higher 41
   days after planting in plots irrigated more frequently than in those
   irrigated less frequently. Population densities early in epidemic
   development were positively correlated with disease incidence and soil
   water content at the time of sampling. In the moderate rainfall field,
   changes in population densities over time were greater on the side of
   the plots where the drip irrigation line was located than on the
   opposite side. Population densities in plots of a field with high
   rainfall were 0, 2, 8, and 38 cfu/g of dry soil at the time of
   infestation and were not affected significantly by the frequency of
   irrigation or the location of the drip irrigation line. Population
   densities in the high rainfall field were highest 42 days after planting
   following a heavy rainfall early in the season. The pathogen spread into
   uninfested plots and was detected after symptoms of disease appeared in
   each field. At the,end of the season, the field with high rainfall had
   higher population densities of P. capsici in initially uninfested plots
   than the field with moderate rainfall. In both fields, population
   densities in soil were too high to allow determination of a threshold
   below which disease was negligible, and populations declined when
   disease incidence was high.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between average and peak personal exposure to nitrogen
   dioxide and urinary excretion of hydroxyproline and desmosine was
   investigated in a population of preschool children and their mothers.
   Weekly average personal nitrogen dioxide exposures for subjects who
   resided in homes with one or more potential nitrogen dioxide source
   (e.g., a kerosene space heater, gas stove, or tobacco smoke) ranged
   between 16.3 and 50.6 ppb (30.6 and 95.1 mug/m3) for children and
   between 16.9 and 44.1 ppb (12.8 and 82.9 mug/m3) for mothers. In these
   individuals, the hydroxyproline-to-creatinine and
   desmosine-to-creatinine ratios were unrelated to personal nitrogen
   dioxide exposure-even though continuous monitoring documented home
   nitrogen dioxide concentration peaks of 100-475 ppb lasting up to 100 h
   in duration. Significantly higher hydroxyproline-to-creatinine and
   desmosine-to-creatinine ratios were observed in children, compared with
   mothers (p < .001 and .003, respectively).}},

Abstract = {{Effects on Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) of low-level
   military jet training ar Canadian Forces Base - Goose Bay (Labrador)
   were studied during the 1986-88 training seasons. Calf survival was
   periodically monitored during 1987 and 1988 in a sample of 15 females
   wearing satellite-tracked radiocollars. During 1987. each female's
   exposure to low-level overflights was experimentally manipulated on a
   daily basis. In 1988, daily exposure was determined by analyzing jet
   flight tracks following the low-level flying season. Calf survival was
   monitored by survey flights every 3-4 weeks. A calf survival index, the
   number of survey periods (maximum = 4) that a cow was accompanied by a
   calf, was negatively correlated with the female's exposure to low-level
   jet overflights during the calving and immediate post calving period and
   again during the period of insect harassment during summer. No
   significant relationship between calf survival and exposure to low-level
   flying was seen during the pre-calving period, during the late
   post-calving period prior to insect harassment. and during fall. In view
   of the continued depression of population growth in the woodland caribou
   population within the low-level training area, jets should avoid
   overflying woodland caribou calving range at least during the last week
   of May and the first three weeks of June.}},

Abstract = {{From 1985 through 1990, the herpetofauna of a temporary pond in an
   uplands longleaf pine sandhills community in north-central Florida was
   monitored. A drift fence completely encircled the pond. Animals were
   captured in pitfall traps and marked as they entered and exited the pond
   basin. I captured 16 155 individuals of 42 species (16 amphibians, 26
   reptiles). The species richness, diversity (using Margalef's Diversity
   Index) and dominance (using the Berger-Parker Index) varied among years.
   Between 62.5\% and 87.5\% of the amphibian species and 65\% to 81\% of
   the reptile species were captured in any one year. Daily amphibian
   capture was positively correlated with rainfall, whereas reptile capture
   was either not correlated or weakly negatively correlated with rainfall.
   Hydroperiod duration was not correlated with the numbers of either
   amphibians or reptiles captured. Neither the amphibian nor the reptile
   community showed any trends in diversity or dominance indices during the
   course of the study, although both communities were dominated by a few
   species. However, the species responsible for community dominance
   changed somewhat as the study progressed. Assessing the results of this
   study is hampered by the lack of comparable studies elsewhere, expected
   natural fluctuations of amphibian populations, and a prolonged drought,
   especially during the latter stages of the study. The herpetological
   community at Breezeway Pond does not appear to follow theoretical
   predictions of community response to stress. Temporary ponds are
   important centres of herpetofaunal biodiversity in uplands sandhills
   communities. Long-term studies are needed to monitor the composition,
   structure, and functional interactions of their resident species.}},

Abstract = {{Trypanosome infections were monitored in three species of tsetse fly
   (Glossina pallidipes Austen, G. morsitans centralis Machado, and G.
   brevipalpis Newstead) at four locations in the Kagera River region of
   Rwanda from May 1989 to September 1990. Two of the four areas (Mpanga
   Ranch and Bukora Ranch) were subjected to tsetse fly suppression
   operations with odour-baited traps. Proboscis infections of the
   Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax types accounted for roughly equal
   numbers of the 207 mature infections detected (3.8\%). Variation in
   infection rates was area-specific rather than tsetse species-specific.
   Order of magnitude differences in tsetse fly densities among areas were
   not correlated with differences in infection rates at the start of
   tsetse fly suppression operations. Similarly, declines in population
   density on both control and experimental areas were not associated with
   significant changes in infection rates. The prevalence of
   trypanosomiasis in cattle at Bukora Ranch was not affected by a roughly
   90\% reduction in Glossina densities. T. congolense accounted for 79\%
   of the infections at an overall prevalence rate of 5.5\%.
   Trypanosomiasis in cattle persisted at extremely low densities of about
   0.1 fly/trap/day. Treatment of cattle with diminazene aceturate
   (Berenil(R)) suggested that many T. congolense parasites were drug
   resistant, and hence, were cycling among cattle due to the few Glossina
   present.}},

Abstract = {{Six pheromone trap designs, including five high-capacity and a sticky

   monitoring blueberry leaftier populations in six blueberry fields in
   Nova Scotia. Larval densities and subsequent male moth catches in the
   same year for all the trap designs evaluated, except double funnel
   traps, were highly correlated. Multipher III traps captured the highest
   number of moths, followed by Unitraps and double funnel traps. The ice
   cream container trap captured significantly fewer moths than any other
   trap design. At most locations, the first moth was caught on the same
   day in all the trap designs except the ice cream container trap. Trap
   catches increased with increasing pheromone concentration up to 0.03\%
   dose. Traps baited with 0.3\% lures captured significantly fewer moths
   than those with 0.003\% or 0.03\%. Based on mean trap catches, R2
   values, coefficients of variation among traps, trap efficiency, and lure
   evaluations, the Unitraps baited with 0.003\% lures are selected for
   further development of a population monitoring system for blueberry
   leaftier moths. The Multipher III traps baited with 0.03\% lures
   captured up to 44 000 male moths (mean per trap per season) at high
   densities, demonstrating their potential in mass trapping blueberry
   leaftiers.}},

Abstract = {{Intra- and inter-plant spatial patterns were determined for adults and
   nymphs of Orius insidiosus (Say) and O. tristicolor (White) on
   greenhouse sweet pepper for three greenhouses using four sampling
   methods. The population density of the Orius was monitored biweekly for
   4 months from May to August using plant tappings, blossoms, plant
   leaves, and whole plants. The intra-plant spatial patterns of adult and
   nymphal populations of Orius were aggregated with the majority of the
   Orius collected from the top one-third of the plant. The inter-plant
   spatial pattern for the nymphs also was aggregated. However, the adults
   exhibited a random inter-plant spatial pattern. The accuracy of plant
   tapping, blossom, and leaf samples was determined for monitoring the
   adult and nymphal population densities of Orius throughout the growing
   season. The blossom sampling method for adult Orius was the best
   sampling method for monitoring the population density of Orius on
   greenhouse sweet pepper throughout the growing season.}},

Abstract = {{The placement of yellow sticky traps in relation to greenhouse-grown
   tomato plants affected the number of greenhouse whiteflies captured on
   traps. Whiteflies were caught on traps close to the ground when the
   traps were 1.0 m or more from plants, and were caught on traps level
   with the point from which they started flight when the traps were 0.5 m
   from plants. Traps 1.0 m from plants primarily caught whiteflies less
   than 5 days old, and trap catches were not correlated with numbers on
   plants; traps 0.5 m from plants caught whiteflies of all ages, and trap
   catches were correlated with numbers on plants. These results suggest
   that under field conditions greenhouse whiteflies would behave much like
   other species of whitefly, and would tend to be caught on traps close to
   the ground. In greenhouses, monitoring traps should be placed close to
   and slightly below the tops of the plants. Trap counts could be treated
   as samples from individual plants and used to make an estimate of
   population size in the greenhouse. Traps placed further from the plants
   monitor flight activity only.}},

   differences were apparent in January and continued throughout the study
   period. The differences in fat content were apparent in February and
   continued until October, when the fat content of maturing fish dropped
   to that of the nonmaturing fish. By the use of logistic regressions
   basesd on fat reserves and body size it was possible to predict. in late
   winter, the probability that a male parr would mature in the following
   autumn. The relative importance of body size and fat content in the
   maturation process was masked by the strong positive correlation between
   these two variables.}},

Abstract = {{Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae have been collected for
   resource monitoring purposes in the Sheepscot River in mid-coastal Maine
   during October-February, for the past 20 years. During this period, the
   larval population in the river has typically peaked in October-early
   November and has been composed of larvae derived from August-September
   spawning in eastern Maine and New Brunswick waters and from
   September-early October spawning along the central Maine coast. Larvae
   from eastern coastal spawning areas are transported to the river by the
   prevailing westerly coastal current. The appearance of small
   (less-than-or-equal-to 15 mm SL) larvae in the river during December and
   January 1985-1989 suggested an additional time and area of origin. Aging
   procedures based on enumeration of daily otolith increments showed the
   majority of these small larvae were spawned from mid October to mid
   November when spawning usually occurs in western Maine coastal waters
   and in the vicinity of Jeffreys Ledge. Comparison of back-calculated
   hatching dates for small larvae collected in the river with wind
   direction and velocity data from mid October through November suggested
   that larvae were transported eastward against a weakened Gulf of Maine
   coastal current to the Sheepscot River by complex wind-driven surface
   currents that occur off the western Maine coast in the fall.}},

   cougar density undoubtedly resulted in part from the fact that available
   roads do not sample properly from the nonuniformly distributed cougar
   population. However, the significantly positive relationship  (r2 = .73)
   we found between track-finding frequency and number of cougar home
   ranges crossing the survey road suggested the technique may be of use in
   monitoring cougar populations where road abundance and location allow
   the population to be sampled properly. The amount of variance in
   track-finding frequency unexplained by number of home ranges overlapping
   survey roads indicates the index may be useful in demonstrating only
   relatively large changes in cougar population size.}},

Abstract = {{The major physiological principles involved in mass production of
   photoautotrophic microalgae outdoors relate to sustained trapping of
   solar energy in as high an efficiency as possible throughout the year.
   The tactics that should be employed for this goal include the
   improvement of suitable species, as well as developing culturing devices
   and proper management protocol aimed to facilitate efficient
   exploitation of the supper saturating photon flux densities existing
   outdoors.
   The most common system used today in industry for outdoor production of
   microalgae is the open raceway, in which stirring is provided by a
   paddle wheel. This mode of production suffers usually from many
   weaknesses, since it does not permit a satisfactory response to the two
   major variables that limit productivity outdoors - i.e.- solar
   irradiance and ambient temperature. Sustained production of algal mass
   the year round requires constant monitoring of the state of the culture
   and adjusting imputs accordingly. The readily controllable variables
   relate to mineral nutrients and carbon balance as well as to turbulent
   streaming in the culture and to the population density.
   The drawbacks of the open system relate in essence to the lack of
   temperature control and the long light-path which dictates maintenance
   of disadvantageously low cell concentrations. The open raceway thus
   falls short of the requirements necessary to insure sustained, year
   round high productivity outdoors.
   It is thus proposed that in the future, closed reactors may become the
   major production mode of microalgae outdoors.}},

   were placed near the surface of the water, those with blue, yellow, and

   approximately the same number of larvae. Therefore, a small change in

   Belonolaimus longicaudatus per pot, nematodes peaked at a mean of 2,139
   nematodes per pot 84 days after inoculation, remained stable through 168
   days at 2,064 nematodes per pot, and declined at 2 1 0 days. The
   relative numbers of juveniles and adults demonstrated senescence after
   84 days. Root dry weight of nematode-inoculated plants increased briefly
   to an apparent equilibrium 84 days after inoculation, whereas root
   weights of uninoculated controls continued to increase, exceeding those
   of inoculated plants from 84 to 2 10 days (P < 0.0 1). At 210 days,
   uninoculated plants had 227\% the root dry weight of inoculated plants.
   Transpiration of FX-313 was reduced by nematodes (P < 0.0001) at 84 and
   126 days after inoculation; reduction was first observed at 42 days and
   last observed 168 days after inoculation (P < 0.05). OM content affected
   all plant performance variables at multiple dates, and generally there
   were no inoculation x OM content interactions. OM content had no effect

   increase in the number of nematodes per gram root dry weight in the
   low-OM soil compared with the high-OM soil.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal progress and spatial distribution of papaya ringspot virus
   (PRV) and populations of aphid vectors were monitored in two papaya
   (Carica papaya) plantations in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. The
   incidence of PRV had a typical sigmoidal curve and the logistic model
   was more acceptable for describing the disease progress than the
   Gompertz model. The rate (r(L)) of increase in disease incidence (0.034
   and 0.023/unit/day in Plot A and B, respectively) differed (P = 0.05)
   between the plots; differences in number of aphids trapped could account
   for the difference. The initial determination of an apparent regular
   spatial pattern early in the epidemic, obtained with a quadrat size
   determined by Greig-Smith's method (n = 8 plants/quadrat) at 50 \%
   disease incidence, was inconsistent with our biological observations in
   the field. An arbitrarily selected, square quadrat size (n = 9
   plants/quadrat), was more consistent with visual observation for
   describing the spatial pattern in the field. With 9 plants/quadrat a
   random pattern was found. Aphid populations had a bimodal distribution
   at both sites with the highest population peak in December-February and
   a secondary peak in August-September and change in disease incidence was
   generally related to the aphid population level in the previous month.
   None of the five potential aphid vectors (Myzus persicae, Aphis
   gossypii, A. nerii, A. citricola and Macrosiphon euphorbiae) of PRV in
   Mexico colonized the papaya plants, however, which may explain the
   absence of clustering of disease.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural patterns of Nereis virens (Sars) were monitored in the
   laboratory to determine variations in the time budget (i.e., percentage
   of time spent in various activities) as a function of density and
   acclimation period (number of days following the introduction of worms
   into experimental enclosures). Experiments were carried out from 17 June
   to 13 August 1989, using worms collected from intertidal sand flats of
   l'Anse a l'Orignal in the lower Saint Lawrence estuary, Canada.
   Inactivity, locomotion and irrigation were, in that order, the most
   frequent behaviours for solitary individuals. Correlations between the
   time spent in the various activities and time of day indicated a general
   increase in activity during the night (21.00 to 06.00 hrs). Locomotory
   activity increased at night, inactivity during the daytime. A general
   sequence of behaviour of N. virens was revealed. Inactivity, locomotion
   and irrigation were still the most frequent activities for individuals
   observed in high-density conditions, but their respective importance
   differed significantly (locomotion, irrigation and inactivity, in that
   order). There was also less variability in the time spent for each
   behaviour in the high-density aquarium. Comparisons between behaviour
   and time of day suggested fewer correlations among the different
   components of the time budgets under conditions of high density.
   Finally, the time budget varied but little over time (number of days
   allowed for acclimation) in the low-density aquarium as opposed to the
   high-density aquarium. Our study revealed that population density and
   acclimation are important in determining behavioural patterns of N.
   virens.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of resources at risk to anthropogenic pollution require
   extensive environmental monitoring. In addition, such assessments are
   required to have a long-term monitoring component in order to evaluate
   not only the status but also the trend of the resources at risk to
   ecological stresses. There is a need to identify statistical
   methodologies that would provide effective and cost-saving environmental
   monitoring designs, since such monitoring surveys are very expensive. In
   this paper the purely sequential, accelerated sequential, and
   three-stage procedures are evaluated as effective fixed-precision
   sampling procedures for environmental monitoring. Current monitoring
   designs utilize a sampling methodology where each resource is assigned a
   population inclusion probability, with the intent of describing the
   distribution of the whole population of resources at risk to
   anthropogenic environmental stresses. This study assumes that existing
   designs accurately describe the population distribution. A simultaneous
   fixed-precision estimation procedure is developed as an efficient method
   of estimating practically relevant percentiles of the cumulative
   distribution function, using water quality data from the Eastern Lake
   Survey as a lake population distribution. Accelerated sequential and
   three-stage procedures are shown to be better alternatives to the purely
   sequential procedure, requiring fewer sampling operations without any
   substantial loss of efficiency. Depending upon the precision required,
   all procedures showed potential reductions in sample size by as much as
   60\%. These types of designs for environmental monitoring are expected
   to be advantageous in national monitoring efforts directed toward the
   assessment of the status and trends of various ecological indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Sexually mature populations of Macrobrachium rosenbergii are composed of
   three male morphotypes: blue clawed males (bulls); orange clawed males;
   and small males (runts), whose growth is socially suppressed. The effect
   of the bull's claws on growth suppression of runts was analyzed through
   a series of manipulations of the bull's second large claws. Runts were
   raised for 112 days in aquaria paired with (a) an intact bull, (b) a
   bull with immobilized dactyli and (c) a bull with ablated claws. A group
   of isolated runts (d) served as a control. Growth of small prawns, their
   motor and maintenance activities and social interactions with the bull
   were monitored. The mechanism of growth suppression in runts is based on
   reduced growth increments per molt, while the rate of molting remained
   the same as in the fast growing individuals. Claw ablation and dactyli
   immobilization in bulls resulted in a complete removal of growth
   suppression in runts which grew similarly to the control. The growth
   rate of runts raised with bulls seems to be positively related to their
   social status.}},

Abstract = {{Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), wolves (Canis lupus), and moose
   (Alces alces) were radio-collared and monitored in two areas of
   southeastern British Columbia to determine predator-prey interactions.
   Throughout the year, wolves and moose used similar areas and habitats,
   and moose were the primary prey of wolves. In winter most caribou used
   high-elevation habitats and were spatially separated from wolves and
   moose living in valley bottoms. In summer, caribou, wolves, and moose at
   Quesnel Lake used similar areas and habitats, whereas in Wells Gray Park
   most caribou migrated to rugged, mountainous areas, which kept them
   spatially separated from wolves and moose. The Quesnel Lake caribou
   population had a high adult mortality rate (29\%/year), wolf predation
   being the major cause. Calf survival to October was low (2.5/100 adult
   females) when wolves were present and uncontrolled in the area, but was
   significantly greater (39/100 adult females) when wolves were reduced or
   absent. The Quesnel Lake caribou population was found to be declining by
   about 25\%/year, and wolf predation appeared to be the major limiting
   factor. Caribou in Wells Gray Park had a low adult mortality rate
   (8\%/year) and comparatively high calf survival to October (37/100 adult
   females). The Wells Gray caribou population was found to be slowly
   increasing, apparently because its migratory behavior kept it separated
   from wolves and moose throughout the year, resulting in low wolf
   predation on the caribou.}},

Title = {{EFFECTS OF PREDATORY SUNFISH ON THE DENSITY, DRIFT, AND REFUGE USE OF
   STREAM SALAMANDER LARVAE}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1418-1430}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We addressed several controversial issues regarding the impact of
   predatory fish on prey in natural streams in Kentucky by experimentally
   adding predatory green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, to four stream pools
   that contained small-mouthed salamander larvae, Ambystoma barbouri,
   while leaving four other pools as fishless controls.  We monitored the
   density, drift (in and out of pools), and habitat use of the larvae
   before and for 1 mo after fish addition (until larvae began to undergo
   metamorphosis).  By quantifying larval density and drift, we were able
   to address two issues:  (1) effect of prey exchange on predator impacts;
   and (2) relative contribution to total predator impact of predation per
   se vs. predator-induced emigration.
   Larval densities and behaviors were similar in experimental and control
   pools before fish addition.  After fish addition:  (1) density decreased
   more rapidly in fish pools than in control pools; (2) larvae in fish
   pools spent more time under rocks and less time in deep, central areas
   than did larvae in control pools; and (3) larval overnight drift rates
   (proportion of larval in a pool, drifting out overnight) were higher in
   fish pools than in control pools.
   We calculated weekly average rates of change in larval density in fish
   and control pools and found that densities in control pools decreased
   very little except during a period with flooding; that is, flooding was
   a major cause of population reduction in fishless pools.  In contrast,
   in fish pools, densities decreased steadily.  Interestingly, the rate of
   decrease in larval density in fish pools was lower during the flood
   period than during other periods.  This might be due to an increase in
   net drift into fish pools, or a decrease in fish predation during
   floods.
   Although net drift (drift in minus drift out) showed a tendency to be
   positive, it did not differ significantly from zero in any situation
   (fish or control pools, day or night).  In particular, fish-induced
   increases in larval per capita emigration rates offset high immigration
   rates into fish pools.  Because there was no significant net drift into
   fish pools, immigration could not swamp predator impacts.  Because there
   was no significant net drift out of fish pools, the decrease in larval
   density in fish pools can be explained entirely by predation per se,
   rather than by predator-induced emigration.
   Our data suggested that, in the experiment year, almost-equal-to 30-40\%
   of all larvae in this population drifted through a fish pool at some
   time in their lives; this estimate is conservative because we were
   unable to get data on drift rates during floods.  On average, only
   almost-equal-to 6-8\% of the larvae that drifted into a fish pool
   survived to drift out the downstream end.  Thus fish predation should be
   a strong selective agent favoring behaviors that enhance larval
   survivorship and drift out of fish pools.
   Auxiliary experiments showed that:  (1) larvae decrease their activity
   when they first drift into fish pools; this presumably decreases the
   conspicuousness of these larvae to visual predators; (2) the presence of
   fish is associated with a larval shift in diurnal activity towards
   greater activity at night rather than in the daytime; this is associated
   with drift out at night; and (3) larvae alter their refuge use and drift
   in response to caged fish, from which larvae probably only receive
   chemical cues.
   Overall, our study is one of the few to simultaneously monitor predator
   effects on prey population dynamics, dispersal, and refuge use. 
   Information on each of these variables helped us to better understand
   predator effects on the other variables; we suggest that it should be
   generally useful to monitor a relatively full set of prey responses to
   predators.}},

Abstract = {{Thrips calcaratus Uzel is an introduced pest of basswood trees in North
   America. Its basic biology and life history are unknown because it is
   not injurious in its native European range. In the present study, the
   general life history of T. calcaratus in Wisconsin was determined using
   emergence trapping, foliar sampling, and soil extraction. This species
   is univoltine; overwintered adults emerge from the soil in early spring,
   feed on buds as they open, and oviposit into the major veins on the
   undersides of leaves. The larvae feed on leaves, descend to the soil,
   and pupate. Degree-day models were computed for the free-living stages
   of T. calcaratus and its host plant phenology. There is close synchrony
   between T. calcaratus emergence and basswood bud swelling and opening.
   Populations of three thrips associates-the pear thrips, Taeniothrips
   inconsequens (Uzel); the native basswood thrips, Neohydalothrips tiliae
   (Hood); and the predacious black hunter thrips, Leptothrips mali
   (Fitch)-were also monitored. The pear thrips is an introduced
   polyphagous pest that has caused severe damage to eastern maples and
   western fruit orchards but has not been heretofore reported in
   midwestern states.}},

Abstract = {{Lemur catta shares a male-biased dispersal pattern with most primate
   species and the majority of mammals. Individuals in a free-ranging
   population of ringtailed lemurs were captured, marked, released, and
   monitored for a 40-month period. Sixty-four percent of the males (43 of
   67) migrated or were missing within this period and all nine censused
   groups were affected by migration. Males migrate from their natal group
   and then may migrate again after reaching full adult body weight.
   Full-sized adult males migrate at a rate of 0. 28 per year or once every
   3.5 years and may change groups a number of times during their life.
   Migrations occurred within a 6-month period, ending just after the
   mating season. However, there is no direct connection between mating
   success and male migration. Females mate with transferring males, with
   group males, and with visitors from adjacent groups. The age-related
   pattern of male migration and the occurrence of extragroup mating in
   Lemur catta is similar to that described for several species of
   macaques.}},

Abstract = {{Annual catches of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus in
   pheromone-baited traps were largely unaffected by the current season
   temperature. Extremely warm or cold summers may have had a slight impact
   on the catches. Monitoring data from traps should therefore provide
   valuable information about population levels. Analyses of temperature
   parameters from the previous year indicate a significant correlation
   between May-June temperatures and trap catches. Models incorporating
   mean maximum May-June temperatures from the previous year showed good
   correlations with actual catches, but the correlation was improved when
   May-August temperatures from the year of trapping are included. The data
   are from 64-80 traps deployed on 20 sites in Akershus in south-east
   Norway during the period 1981 to 1990.}},

Abstract = {{A glass-vial technique was developed to detect permethrin resistance in
   soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker), larvae. Third-,
   fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-instar soybean loopers from two susceptible
   (laboratory) and eight field strains were exposed to permethrin using a
   glass-vial technique to estimate concentration-mortality lines. Probit
   analysis of results from each field strain indicated that LC50s for
   third, fourth, and fifth instars were not significantly different.
   Therefore, concentration-mortality lines for each soybean looper strain
   were estimated by pooling data from these three instars. A
   discriminating concentration of 0.5-mu-g permethrin per vial was
   identified for detection of permethrin resistance in field populations
   of soybean looper larvae. Field strains from cotton-soybean
   agroecosystems responded similarly and had higher levels of resistance
   than strains from soybean-com agroecosystems. The reliability of the
   vial bioassay was confirmed by topical bioassays done on the same
   populations that had been tested in the vials and a comparison of
   resistance ratios. Correlation analysis indicated that the vial
   technique was as reliable as topical bioassays in estimating resistance,
   although resistance ratios with vials were slightly higher at most
   locations.}},

Abstract = {{A resistance monitoring technique using yellow sticky cards sprayed with
   insecticides efficiently and sensitively detected resistance in field
   populations. The distribution of resistance in the sweetpotato whitefly,
   Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), in Imperial Valley, Calif., was determined
   with this technique. Thirty-two populations exhibited various levels of
   resistance to sulprofos (resistance ratio {[}RR] ranging from 19 to 104)
   and cypermethrin (RR ranging from 14 to 82) during 1987 and 1988,
   indicating that insecticide resistance is widespread in the Imperial
   Valley. The advantages of this new method for monitoring resistance in
   whiteflies are discussed in relation to conventional leaf bioassays.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of a Phaeocystis bloom off Plymouth in spring 1990 is
   described. Data were obtained (1) during weekly visits to station El to
   measure physical parameters, nutrient concentrations, primary production
   and grazing pressure and (2) by regular tows of an Undulating
   Oceanographic Recorder around a circuit of five stations including El to
   detect stratification, monitor the geographical distribution of
   chlorophyll and determine vertical profiles at each station.
   The data show that the Phaeocystis bloom emanated from near-shore, its
   spread towards the south-east correlating with the wind direction
   prevailing at the time. Due to bad weather, seasonal stratification had
   not been established at the time of the bloom so that a major diatom
   outburst had not occurred and nutrients remained high as the Phaeocystis
   moved offshore.
   Zooplankton populations at E1, averaged over 50 m, decreased whilst
   Phaeocystis was present, resulting in very low grazing pressure.
   Termination of the bloom was not, therefore, due to consumption by
   herbivores. It was, instead, caused by Phaeocystis colonies becoming
   nutrient-depleted and releasing single cells which were transported
   downwards. As a result of this, chlorophyll concentrations near the
   bottom remained high for some time after the Phaeocystis had disappeared
   from the surface water.
   A scenario is proposed to explain the observations in terms of our
   current understanding of the ecophysiology of Phaeocystis.}},

Abstract = {{A multifactorial, stratified, randomized survey was done in the spanner
   crab Ranina ranina fishing grounds off the coast of New South Wales,
   Australia, to determine fluctuations in relative distributions and
   abundances across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. An optimal,
   standardized sampling regime involving baited tangle traps (developed in
   previous work) was applied throughout the main geographical and depth
   ranges of the fishery every 2 mo for 2 yr. The population exhibited a
   sex ratio of 55 \% female and marked sexual dimorphism with males
   generally attaining larger sizes than females. Because of a 93 mm
   minimum size limit, male crabs comprised 87.6\% of the portion of the
   population that was targeted by fishermen and 94.4 \% of females were
   found to be protected. Further, 74.4 \% of the population was undersize,
   69 \% of which were female. These results imply that the fishery should
   be in a sound position, ensuring long-term viability through maintenance
   of a large spawning population. The results generally supported this
   conclusion although there were large variabilities in abundances across
   all spatial and temporal scales investigated. A decline in the numbers
   of targeted, large male crabs (110 to 119 mm carapace length) was
   detected over the 2 yr period for 2 of the 5 locations surveyed. Catches
   of crabs (especially females) decreased during October and December each
   year, coinciding with the spawning period. The distributions of crabs
   revealed the potential for different locations and depths as reservoirs
   of spawning stocks, regular suppliers of marketable crabs or relatively
   unproductive areas. The results are discussed in terms of current and
   future management strategies, potential problems due to fishing and the
   usefulness of stratified, randomized surveys in detecting and monitoring
   abundances in this fishery.}},

   Populations of hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were monitored following
   their introductions into an area where they had been absent, and into a
   neighbouring area where they were known to persist. The two sites had a
   similar availability of preferred habitat, and the growth rates of
   introduced hedgehogs were similar. The density of badgers (Meles meles),
   larger members of the same guild, appears to produce differences in
   mortality and dispersal, which returned the populations close to their

   Methods were based on the use of different monitoring devices, whose
   efficiency was evaluated.
   The abundance of L. monacha monitored by pheromone traps, was inversely
   proportional to the altitude and the catches fell always within the
   range known for the latent populations.
   The following species of sawflies of the genus Cephalcia were found, in
   order of decreasing abundance: C. arvensis, C.fallenii, C. abietis, C.
   alashanica. They presented different flight period, C.fallenii being the
   first emerging species in spring, followed by C. arvensis, C. abietis,
   C. alashanica and C. arvensis again. The problem of the peaks in the
   flight of C. arvensis is discussed in the light of the recent findings
   in Czechoslovakia. The devices used in monitoring (tree band, yellow
   board, emergence trap) supplied different results for the sex ratio and
   the level of catches. Evidence for attraction between individuals is
   given.
   The catches of the most abundant species were strongly influenced by the
   altitude and the stand characteristics. L. monacha seems to prefer the
   lower sites, with a large number of small trees. C. arvensis and
   C.fallenii were most abundant in the colder sites, characterized by a
   medium (C. arvensis) or a medium-high (C.fallenii) diameter and by a low
   number of trees. The results are compared with the stand characteristics
   of the outbreak areas.}},

Abstract = {{Survival of Least Auklets (Aethia pusilla) was investigated at St. Paul
   Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, during three breeding seasons
   (1987-1989). Based on resightings of color-marked birds, an overall
   annual adult survival rate of about 0.75 was observed. Because of their
   fidelity to nesting and display sites, as well as their insensitivity to
   capture early in the breeding season, this estimate was unlikely to be
   substantially biased by emigration from the study plot or disturbance
   caused by handling. An index of adult body condition was highly variable
   during the 1988 breeding season, but was weakly correlated with
   subsequent survival. However, the body-condition index was significantly
   correlated to likelihood of breeding in the same and following years.
   Survival was not related to adults' variable plumage, although lightness
   of plumage correlated with age and dominance and functions for status
   signalling in this species. Survival was significantly lowered in
   individuals with damage to their webbed feet. Subadults (two-year-olds)
   showed low site fidelity compared to adults. Age of first breeding was
   at three years. During the breeding season, known causes of mortality
   included predation by foxes, gulls, and humans. The low annual survival
   of Least Auklets relative to other alcids, together with large
   year-to-year variation in reproductive performance, suggests there is
   greater potential for population fluctuations in this species. Survival
   estimation may be a partial solution to the difficulty of monitoring
   alcid populations directly.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental population of a perennial SpeCieS, Cassia marilandica,
   was monitored for 4 years to examine changes in size structure and seed
   production over time. Plants flowered and set seed the 1st year and
   annually thereafter. Plant size, seed mass per plant, and reproductive
   effort were highest in the 2nd year but declined thereafter. Over the
   first 3 years, density remained constant, but plant size and yield
   varied. By the 4th year, density, size, and seed yield all declined,
   owing probably to combinations of drought and insect herbivory. Mean
   distance to nearest neighbors was consistently positively correlated
   with plant size but with seed mass in the 2nd and 3rd years only. Plant
   size was positively correlated with seed mass in each year, with
   reproductive effort in the first 3 years, but with relative growth rate
   in the last 2 years only. Population size structure and lifetime
   reproductive output were generally positively skewed. Except for a
   slight effect from the 1st to the 2nd year, no cost of reproduction,
   measured as reduced growth, reproduction, or likelihood of survival was
   seen.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater mussels are increasingly used to monitor metal pollution in
   freshwater systems. Mussels are long-lived, and age is a factor that may
   influence metal concentrations in their tissues. Species that can be
   precisely aged are most suitable for biomonitoring because they can be
   standardized for this factor. Precise age estimates are also needed for
   determining the effects of contamination on population parameters such
   as growth rate. Elliptio complanata, Anodonta implicata, and Alasmidonta
   undulata (family Unionidae) were collected from two Nova Scotia lakes
   contaminated with arsenic and mercury. Mussel shells were weighed,
   measured, and sectioned, and two independent counts of internal growth
   bands were made. External rings were also counted for A. implicata. Age
   estimates based on internal bands were most precise for E. complanata
   (r2 = 0.71 vs. 0.35 for A. implicata and 0.29 for A. undulata).
   Estimates based on external rings were more precise (r2 = 0.69) than
   those based on internal bands for A. implicata, but were believed to
   include disturbance rings. Shell length and weight were similarly
   correlated with age for a given species and population, but
   relationships were less clear in the lake with the more variable
   habitat. Elliptio complanata were much smaller at a given age in the
   more contaminated lake.}},

   polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCB/DFs), or mirex. All the PHBs induced
   the P450IA2 activity of the exposed subjects as compared to the
   nonexposed control group. The capacity of each PHB to induce P450IA2
   activity correlated with the known toxicity of each exposure
   (PCB/DF>PBB> mirex) in the human. P450IA2 activity as measured by the
   caffeine breath test may by a most useful biomarker in monitoring and
   understanding the effects of PHBs on the human population.}},

Abstract = {{The orientation of males of the sorghum midge, Contarinia sorghicola
   Coq. (Diptera:  Cecidomyiidae) towards virgin female baited sticky traps
   was studied in the field.  Male response increased linearly with an
   increase in the number of virgin females in the sticky traps.  Five
   females per vial were optimum for monitoring midge populations in the
   field.  Numbers of males trapped were significantly greater in traps
   placed at 0.5 and 1.5 m above ground level compared with those placed at
   2.5 m.  Peak trap catches occurred at 0900 h.  The number of males
   trapped decreased significantly after 1400 h; male catches continued
   till sunset.  Trap catches followed the same pattern as the number of
   ovipositing females on sorghum panicles at the half-anthesis stage. 
   Midge activity decreased with an increase in temperature and a decrease
   in relative humidity.  Peak midge density was observed during the second
   fortnight of October in the rainy season and during February-March in
   the post-rainy season.  Sex pheromones can be used to monitor midge
   population dynamics for integrated pest management and to screen for
   host plant resistance to this insect.}},

Abstract = {{As human influences fragment native communities and ecosystems,
   remaining land must be better managed to conserve many elements of
   biodiversity. Much of this land is privately held, yet traditional
   private land-use management practices often further diminish
   biodiversity by promoting favored or edge-adapted species.
   Today, private land stewards are increasingly aware of and concerned
   about biodiversity, but little guidance exists for them to make land-use
   decisions incorporating principles and knowledge from conservation
   biology. Consequently, most management strategies are highly subjective.
   This article addresses that problem by introducing current conservation
   wisdom to management and use of private lands. The result is a model
   program for developing land management plans, with the goal of
   maintaining viable populations and natural distributions of native
   species and communities from a landscape perspective.
   The program establishes a protocol for classifying sites according to
   the importance of their species, communities, and other elements to
   global and regional biodiversity. These site classifications are based
   on the management objectives necessary to maintain important elements.
   Once managers classify a site, the program provides management
   standards, general stewardship principles, examples of land management
   strategies, and basic monitoring and evaluation procedures.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{513-520}},

Abstract = {{Land reclamation techniques that incorporate habitat features for
   herptofaunal wildlife have received little attention. We assessed the
   suitability of a wetland, constructed for the treatment of mine-water
   drainage, for supporting herptofaunal wildlife from 1988 through 1990
   using diurnal and nocturnal surveys. Natural wetlands within the
   surrounding watershed were also monitored for comparison. The treatment
   wetland supported the greatest abundance and species richness of
   herptofauna among the sites surveyed. Abundance was a function of the
   frog density, particularly green frogs (Rana clamitans) and pickerel
   frogs (R. palustris), while species richness was due to the number of
   snake species found. The rich mix of snake species present at the
   treatment wetland was believed due to a combination of an abundant frog
   prey base and an amply supply of den sites in rock debris left behind
   from earlier surface-mining activities. Nocturnal surveys of breeding
   male frogs demonstrated highest breeding activity at the treatment
   wetland, particularly for spring peepers (Hyla crucifer). Whole-body
   assays of green frog and bullfrog (R. catesbeiana) tissues showed no
   differences among sites in uptake of iron, aluminum, and zinc; manganese
   levels in samples from the treatment wetland were significantly lower
   than those from natural wetlands. These results suggest that wetlands
   established for water quality improvement can provide habitat tor
   reptiles and amphibians, with the species composition dependent on the
   construction design, the proximity to source populations, and the degree
   of acidity and heavy-metal concentrations in drainage waters.}},

Abstract = {{The predacious mite, Euseius addoensis addoensis (McMurtry) (Acari:
   Phytoseiidae), significantly (P < 0.05) reduced scarring on `Palmer
   Navel' oranges, Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck, caused by the citrus
   thrips, Scirtothrips aurantii Faure (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). A
   chemical exclusion method employing dicofol was used to determine the
   effect of the predator and numbers of S. aurantii were monitored on
   sticky yellow traps. At two sites where numbers of citrus thrips and
   predacious mites were high, the percentage fruit culled from export
   quality due to damage by S. aurantii was reduced from 25.5 to 15.5\% and
   from 32.7 to 18.7\% by predacious mite activity. Euseius a. addoensis
   sometimes prevented damage from exceeding 1\% cull and was most
   effective when mean numbers exceeded one mite per inside leaf at petal
   fall. The best correlation between numbers of mites and the percentage
   fruit culled at harvest was -0.96 at the location with the highest
   number of citrus thrips. Tartar emetic (0.398\% a.i.) plus sugar (0.4\%
   a.i.) treatments for citrus thrips were slightly detrimental to E. a.
   addoensis populations but their numbers soon recovered. An alternative
   treatment, methiocarb 0.016\% a.i. plus sugar (0.4\% a.i.), almost
   eliminated the predacious mites and resulted in more citrus thrips
   damage (10.7\% cull) than in the adjacent untreated control (0.2\% cull)
   which contained predacious mites.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the intensive management of German forests, the main purpose of
   bark beetle monitoring is not to detect stands of high infestation risk.
   Much more, monitoring shall give a rough idea of regional population
   trends. Some years experience show that single mo tor traps more than 50
   m apart from each other use to cause pheromone induced infestations in
   nearby standing spruce.  Thus, in 1988 a system of monitoring has been
   established in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein which consists of
   mass trapping lines along stand margins as usual (distances of 30-50 m
   between traps and 10-15 m between traps and next spruce) but each of
   them with one fortnightly checked trap:  the monitor trap. This system
   helps reducing infestations and provides records of semimonthly data
   from April to September. The analysis of 3 years of flight activity
   patterns and data tables did not reveal a method to use these data for a
   long term prediction. However, a short term prediction based on monthly
   warning messages referring to regions seems to be feasible, provided
   that corresponding short term thresholds of infestation risks will be
   elaborated.}},

Abstract = {{I studied behavior and range patterns of individual bottlenose dolphins
   during 1984 in the mid-eastern Gulf of California, Mexico. Dolphin
   sighting rate was significantly higher in areas close to estuary mouths,
   0.306 sightings per hour compared with 0.155 sightings per hour in areas
   distant from estuary mouths. Dolphins used these estuarine areas to
   feed; 61\% of all behavior observed near estuaries was feeding as
   compared with 23\% elsewhere. Traveling comprised 61\% of all behavior
   observed in areas distant from estuary mouths. Estuaries are sites of
   large concentrations of nutrients which support great numbers of
   filter-feeding zooplankton and fish. Bottlenose dolphins may specialize
   on estuarine prey, or they may feed in estuarine areas simply because of
   the abundance of potential prey that these systems support. In either
   case, data on relative numbers, distribution patterns, behavior and diet
   indicate that this is a general trend in habitat use for many coastal
   populations of this species in the Pacific and Atlantic. Ranges of a few
   individuals spanned a minimum of 65 km of coastline, and animals were
   not permanent residents of a monitored bay. In contrast, dolphins off
   the coast of Sarasota, Florida, have been reported to be year-round
   residents with smaller ranges. This difference in degree of site
   fidelity may be related to habitat differences. The west coast of
   Florida is dotted with numerous and large estuarine systems which may
   host permanent prey populations and support resident groups of dolphins.
   The Gulf of California coastline contains few estuaries; most are small
   and perhaps support prey resources which are ephemeral, requiring
   dolphins to range over larger distances in search of food.}},

Abstract = {{Predatory larvae of the mosquito Toxorhynchites moctezuma were used
   experimentally to control a standing crop of larvae of the dengue vector
   mosquito Ae.aegypti. Each week, fifty Ae.aegypti first instar larvae
   were introduced to each of five water-filled drums (220 litres) of the
   type commonly used for domestic water storage in Caribbean dwellings. At
   the beginning of the fourth week, a certain number (0, 1, 2, 5 or 10) of
   first instar Tx.moctezuma larvae were introduced to each drum and the
   daily yield of Ae.aegypti adults from each drum was monitored
   thereafter. The experiment was repeated three times. With only one or
   two Tx.moctezuma larvae, predation on Ae.aegypti larvae stopped the
   output of Ae.aegypti adults for 1 week. Five or ten Tx. moctezuma
   prevented any Ae. aegypti emergence for up to 16 weeks. Cannibalism
   among Tx.moctezuma larvae was seldom observed and appeared not to be a
   hindrance in using this species against Ae.aegypti.  Thus Tx.moctezuma
   is regarded as a good candidate for the biological control of Ae.aegypti
   by augmentative releases.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between soil invertebrate populations and primary
   production of a tallgrass prairie were investigated using the
   insecticide-nematicide carbofuran and a range of mowing intensities to
   manipulate invertebrate densities and resource quantity and quality. The
   trophic composition of nematode populations was monitored through each
   of two growing seasons. Earthworm and macroarthropod densities and
   primary production were assessed at the end of the second season.
   Invertebrate densities were generally reduced in carbofuran-treated
   plots, although individual weights of surviving macroarthropod
   herbivores increased significantly (p < 0.05). Carbofuran failed to
   affect estimates of above- or belowground plant biomass after two years
   of treatment. Changes in resource quantity and quality resulted in rapid
   responses by dominant invertebrate consumer populations. A 28\%
   reduction in live root mass and a 24\% increase in root detritus
   following two years of mowing was associated with a 54\% decrease in
   herbivorous nematode densities, a 47\% increase in microbivorous
   nematode densities, and a 41\% increase in native earthworm biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Land protection alone is not sufficient to accomplish in situ
   conservation objectives. Habitat management is required to help address
   most of the threats to rare plant populations and their habitats. The
   high cost of land protection can often be countered by focusing
   conservation activity on public land where land acquisition is not an
   issue. it is still necessary, though, to focus conservation resources on
   populations that will best contribute to the protection of the species.
   A range-wide approach using Heritage data to compare all existing
   occurrences is discussed. A management planning process is described for
   those populations that do become the focus of in situ efforts. This
   planning process includes the development of ecological models that
   describe the interaction among the species, its habitat and key
   ecological processes. These models aid in the development of site
   designs and the establishment of measurable conservation goals. The
   success of management actions at reaching these goals should be tracked
   in focused biological monitoring programs. This feedback mechanism
   enables land managers to reevaluate their ecological assumptions,
   conservation goals and management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{At present, the quantitative differences between environmental exposure
   and occupational exposure to toxic metals are steadily decreasing, it
   becomes important to establish reference values of the tests used for
   biological monitoring.  However, the word `reference values' is often
   used inappropriately and in particular its significance is often
   confused with that of `limit values' or `normal values'.  The term
   reference values defines the levels of the biological indicators in the
   general population which are not occupationally exposed.  It is
   necessary to refer to these values in order to compare the data obtained
   through biological monitoring programmes in workers and in groups of the
   general population which are presumed to be exposed.  The most essential
   aspects for identifying reference values for toxic metals, using a
   rigorous methodology, are taken into consideration and in particular,
   the requisites needed for identifying the subjects which must be
   included in the reference groups are also examined.  The modalities for
   using reference values for individual subjects as well as for groups are
   then discussed and the main points of research which must be faced in
   the near future regarding reference values are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the difficulties related to the definition of a reference
   population and hence of reference limits, special methodological
   problems have to be dealt with when early markers of renal damage are
   applied to monitor groups at risk.  The urinary excretion of both high
   and low molecular weight proteins, as measured by sensitive
   immunoassays, is routinely applied in health surveillance programmes
   aimed at preventing the occurrence of adverse renal effects resulting
   from exposure to nephrotoxic chemicals, among which are several metals. 
   Owing to the large intra-individual variability experimentally
   demonstrated for all indicators of renal impairment, carefully
   standardized sampling conditions must be adopted.  At the individual
   level, repeated measurements should be performed before a diagnosis of
   renal disease or dysfunction is established.  In fact, several
   physiological conditions may account for transient changes in renal
   function, leading to measured levels greatly exceeding reference limits.}},

Abstract = {{Tsetse populations and trypanosome infections were monitored at the
   Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary to assess the impact of trypanosomiasis on
   rhinoceros. High densities of Glossina pallidipes were found near a
   permanent spring by the Ngulia escarpment; G. longipennis and G.
   brevipalpis were also present in lower numbers. Infection rates in G.
   pallidipes averaged 3.6\%, with three times as many T. vivax as T.
   congolense infections. T. simiae and T. brucei were present at low
   frequency. DNA probes revealed that all mature T. congolense infections
   belonged to the Savanna subgroup. G. pallidipes fed on many hosts, with
   most meals taken from bovids and elephants. Rhino account for one of the
   blood meals in a small sample taken from G. longipennis. During a time
   of low tsetse densities (dry season), we estimated that the wild host
   population was acquiring seven infections per km2 per day. At lower
   levels of challenge, an experimental rhino became infected with T.
   congolense. These results are discussed in terms of future plans for the
   repopulation of rhino in tsetse-infested areas in Kenya.}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent checklists of the freshwater fish of the British Isles have
   included 42 native and 13 introduced species. Of the former, however,
   two are extinct now and eight are threatened in various ways. In
   addition there are several important stocks of common native species
   under threat.
   2. Protection for British fish exists mainly through legislation and
   protected sites of various designations. The legislation is inadequate
   in some respects and very few of the protected sites were actually
   established for their fish interest. Nevertheless, in Great Britain, 37
   species of fish occur in National Nature Reserves. The overall status of
   fish in Sites of Special Scientific Interest is unknown.
   3. The main conservation options for managing freshwater fish resources
   are habitat restoration, stock transfer to new sites, captive breeding
   and cryopreservation. The first two of these are regarded as the most
   useful for the long-term conservation of threatened species. Improved
   legislation would also help, especially in relation to preventing the
   import and transfer of potentially harmful species.
   4. As well as the implementation of conservation management programmes
   for rare fish, research and monitoring studies are also needed in order
   to aid management and maintain a watch on populations of important
   species. In addition, national fish databases and registers of important
   stocks are an important background for overall fish conservation and
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The exposure of aquatic species to a variety of genotoxic chemicals
   raises the question as to the potential effects of exposure upon the
   health status of both current and future aquatic populations. The
   induction of DNA lesions in exposed species may initiate the formation
   of both structural and point mutations in genes, the modifications of
   which may lead to abnormality in both somatic and germ cells. The
   assessment of exposure levels of genotoxic agents and the genetic
   consequences requires the application of a set of inter-related
   techniques capable of providing both qualitative and quantitative
   information.
   In this paper we describe some methodologies available for the (a)
   assessment of genotoxin induced DNA adducts using the P-32-postlabelling
   procedure, (b) measurement of point mutations using the restriction site
   mutation assay and (c) the measurement of the production of chromosome
   structural and numerical aberrations using the micronucleus assay. This
   package of technologies may be optimised to use with individual species
   present in the aquatic environment to provide a cost effective package,
   capable of monitoring genotoxin exposure of individual environments.}},

Abstract = {{Thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) hunting by Inuit of West Greenland was
   surveyed during the winter and spring of 1988/89. Kill toll levels and
   age structure of the kill were determined for districts between
   Upernavik (73-degrees-N) and Nanortalik (60-degrees-N). Based on counts
   of the numbers of birds available for purchase at markets and on
   information from processing companies, an estimated 100 000 murres were
   killed for commercial trading purposes in 1988/89. Non-commercial
   hunting is harder to assess, but estimates based on the number of
   licences issued and the mean number of murres killed per day by
   non-commercial hunters indicate that between 190 000 and 293 000 murres
   are killed per annum. Thus the total kill toll is estimated to be
   between 283 000 and 386 000 murres annually. In Central West and
   Southwest Greenland the peak hunting period was November and December,
   but hunting continued to 15 March or until ice conditions prevented
   sailing.
   Age distribution of the kill was determined by classifying 6278 murres
   as ``first-year{''} or ``older{''} by the development of the cranium. In
   Southwest Greenland the proportion of older birds in the kill was always
   below 9\%. whereas in Central West Greenland (Nuuk) the value increased
   from 27.5\% in October to 75.8\% old birds in March. About 90\% of the
   murres killed in spring near major breeding colonies in Upernavik were
   adult breeding birds, and hunting near the breeding grounds is
   considered the major cause for population reductions. Murres shot in
   winter are mostly birds from colonies outside Greenland. but though it
   has yet to be proved, the immense kill of murres during the winter hunt
   probably affects the populations involved.
   Recommendations for improvement of the management of murre populations
   in Greenland include public education programs and law enforcement,
   reduction of number of hunters and shortened winter hunting season.
   Further research is needed on the magnitude and variation of the
   non-commercial hunt. detailed breeding population monitoring and origin
   of killed birds.}},

Abstract = {{During summer 1987, a series of experiments was performed in conjunction
   with monitoring of in situ plankton dynamics in nutrient-deficient
   Castle Lake, California. These factorial manipulations of nutrients and
   zooplankton were designed to separate the direct (grazing mortality) and
   indirect (stimulation of algal growth by nutrient recycling) effects of
   grazers on both species-specific phytoplankton dynamics, as well as
   aggregate properties such as total biomass, productivity, and biomass
   turnover. Grazing loss rates differed significantly among algal species
   with the mean grazing loss rate suffered by an algal species a negative
   function of cell or colony size. Stimulation of division rates in the
   presence of zooplankton (compared to an unenriched treatment lacking
   zooplankton) was commonly observed. Nutrient and grazer treatments also
   had significant impacts on algal biomass (indicated by chlorophyll
   concentration), productivity (PPR), and PPR/chlorophyll, and significant
   nutrient-grazer interactions were frequently observed. Species-specific
   algal responses to grazers were aggregated across the phytoplankton by
   weighting species-specific parameters by the contribution of each
   species to total community biomass in order to provide community-wide
   estimates of the importance of direct and indirect effects on algal
   dynamics. Finally, linkages between population-level responses and
   aggregate properties were demonstrated by examining relationships
   between total phytoplankton biovolume concentration and chlorophyll
   concentration in various treatments, by comparing community-wide grazing
   rates estimated from aggregated species-specific grazing rates and from
   changes in chlorophyll growth rates, and by relating the aggregated
   degree of species-specific growth stimulation to stimulation of biomass
   turnover. These results indicate that phytoplankton responses to grazers
   in Castle Lake reflect a mix of direct and indirect effects that varies
   considerably both between species and through time during the stratified
   season.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the economic importance of the com leafhopper, Dalbulus maidis
   (DeLong \& Wolcott), little is known about how this maize pest and its
   congeners survive the dry winter in Mexico. In the field, Dalbulus
   populations were monitored weekly with yellow sticky card traps for 18
   mo at three sites in Jalisco, Mexico. The sites included a maize field,
   Zea maysL.; a natural stand of a perennial teosinte, Zea diploperennis
   Iltis, Doebley \& Guzman; and a natural population-of gamagrasses,
   Tripsacum spp., which are maize relatives. At all sites, highest catches
   of Dalbulus adults occurred during the dry season between October and
   March. In a laboratory study to test the survival of adult Dalbulus
   leafhoppers without their host plants, significant differences were
   detected among leafhopper species. When denied all food and water
   (absolute drought), Dalbulus species that specialize on maize were more
   tolerant than those that specialize on gamagrass. Adults reared under
   environmental conditions that simulate the beginning of the wet season
   (june-reared) were less tolerant of absolute drought than adults reared
   under early dry-season conditions (October-reared). When provided water
   but no food, October-reared D.-maidis lived significantly longer than
   June-reared D. maidis. Survival of females under water-only conditions
   was significantly longer than that of males. Field observations revealed
   that gamagrass-specializing D. gelbus DeLong and D. quinquenotatus
   DeLong \& Nault overwinter as continuously developing populations on
   their hosts. In contrast, our data indicate that D. maidis overwinter as
   active adults that can subsist, at least in part, on free water in the
   absence of host plants until the summer rainy season begins. Surviving
   adults then migrate locally to newly planted maize fields.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a semi-synthetic diet, a standard rearing method for the cotton
   bollworm, Heliothis armigera Hubner, is described. The diet is composed
   of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) flour, yeast powder, sucrose, ascorbic
   acid, cholesterol, choline chloride, wheat germ oil, vitamin mixture and
   a combination of preservatives. A plastic container for individual
   rearing of the cannibalistic larvae and a cage for mating of adult moths
   are described. After inoculation with the neonate larvae, development of
   the different stages was synchronous on this diet. The larval and pupal
   development period was 14.3 +/- 1.2 and 11.7 +/- 0.82 days,
   respectively. Females reared on this diet produced an average of 2000
   eggs. Adult longevity was 22 days. The female moths retained their
   oviposition rhythm even after 3 years of laboratory rearing. A method
   for introduction of wild populations into the laboratory culture is
   discussed. The reliability of the technique was checked by monitoring
   the insects' performance for at least 25 generations.}},

   studied in populations from the northwestern Mediterranean. Over a 2 yr
   monitoring period, the growth, mortality, reproduction and resistance
   periods of a number of colonies were recorded. A marked intraspecific
   variability in most parameters was evident, but a seasonal pattern
   emerged for most species, with more active growth in winter. Several
   types of resting and resistance periods, presumably of different
   biological significance, were observed in some species in the warm
   season. There were great differences in survival parameters among the
   species studied. These correlated with differences in total biomass/area
   and zooid/tunic proportions, thus indicating different biological
   strategies even in species of similar growth form and ecological
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal of Phytophthora parasitica from point sources of inoculum
   buried in irrigation furrows in field plots of processing tomatoes
   (Lycopersicon esculentum) was monitored during five successive
   irrigations. During the fourth and fifth irrigations, leaf-disk baits
   floated on the surface of irrigation water became colonized by P.
   parasitica at distances 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 m downstream from
   infestation sites, but no leaf disks became colonized 2 m upstream in
   infested furrows or at any distance in noninfested furrows. Tomato
   seedlings placed into furrows 50 m downstream from infestation sites
   became infected during all five irrigations. At the end of the season,
   incidence of buckeye rot on tomato fruit, caused by P. parasitica,
   increased linearly with logarithmic increases in distance from 0 to 68 m
   downstream from original points of inoculum. Symptoms of root rot on
   tomato plants were severe and, with one exception, final populations of
   P. parasitica in the soil under furrows were high only at or very near
   infestation sites. Shoot symptoms were visible only at an original point
   of infestation and after the fifth irrigation. Dispersal of the pathogen
   in irrigation water was most important in development of buckeye rot on
   fruit. Although the pathogen was also dispersed to roots, the severity
   of symptoms on roots at distances greater-than-or-equal-to 2 m was
   generally below that necessary for development of shoot symptoms or
   yield loss.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the analysis of heavy metal (Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, Hg, Fe,
   Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) and As accumulated in the mollusc Mytilus
   galloprovincialis collected in the Venetian lagoon between March and
   September 1988. This environmental biomonitoring project was carried out
   using natural population of the molluscs attached to the `Briccole',
   which limit the navigation canals into the lagoon. These data were
   compared with those reported by other authors in analogous studies
   published about a decade ago. A small improvement on the heavy metal
   pollution of the Venetian lagoon can be deduced from this comparison,
   presumably depicting a positive signal of a new downward trend in metal
   concentrations. Continuous monitoring of the fragile lagoonal ecosystem
   must be an important commitment due to the economic and historical
   importance of the Venetian lagoon.}},

Abstract = {{Cultured one-year old mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, (Lmk.) were
   transplanted to four sites (120 individuals per site) throughout the
   Krka River Estuary, and nearby Adriatic coastal area. Concentrations of
   zinc, cadmium, lead and copper, and their content in mussels were
   analysed four times during 1988/89 (270 days). The body weight of
   mussels increased during the period studied and a discernible effect of
   the size of mussels on metal concentration was detected. The
   concentrations of the metals studied, expressed on a per unit dry
   weight, generally decreased with the body size and the age of mussels,
   but no seasonal trends could be established. The mussels transplanted to
   sites situated in the vicinity of the Sibenik harbour accumulated zinc
   and lead. This could be attributed to elevated concentrations of zinc
   and lead in water (higher than 500 ng Zn l-1 and 14 ng Pb l-1 of
   `bioavailable' forms). Significant correlation between body lead
   concentrations and lead amount in the surrounding water was obtained,
   while for zinc, no statistically significant relationship exists between
   body concentrations and the water phase. The fluctuations of cadmium and
   copper in the adjacent water have no significant effect on the changes
   of their concentrations in the transplanted mussels. The data obtained
   indicate that because of biological similarities and better
   reproducibility of the results the transplanted mussels are more
   suitable for monitoring of trace metals than indigenous mussel
   populations as originally proposed by the `Mussel Watch' programme.}},
