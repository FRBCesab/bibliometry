Abstract = {{Field sampling methods and economic thresholds were developed to provide
   management recommendations for Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) on
   processing tomatoes, based on a commercially acceptable damage level of
   5\% fruit damage. Population estimates from destructive sampling, and a
   rapid 1-min plant scouting method were related to fruit damage, and a
   nominal economic threshold of one larva per plant was derived. The
   economic threshold was confirmed in a designed trial where it resulted
   in acceptable levels of fruit damage. The 1-min scouting method a-ad
   economic threshold was validated in 17 commercial crops in the Gisborne,
   Poverty Bay region of New Zealand . Scouting in these fields was based
   on 10 plants in each of four quadrants proportionally representing the
   topography of each field. In unsprayed areas, egg and larval populations
   were usually below the economic threshold in early-planted crops but
   often exceeded thresholds in late-planted crops. In commercial
   demonstration trials where standard calendar spraying practice was
   compared with no spraying, calendar-based applications maintained
   fi-trit damage below 3.4\%, but insecticide was applied unnecessarily to
   more than half the crops. Larval populations were a significant
   predictor of damage in these commercial crops. In 12 implementation
   trials, where spraying recommendations were based on the 1-min scouting
   threshold of one larva per plant, the worst fruit damage observed was
   2.3\%. The definition of an economic threshold, scouting methods, and
   establishment of parasitoids have reduced spray applications and
   contributed to the implementation of an integrated pest management
   program for processing tomatoes in New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{This study monitored the abundance of the tropical/subtropical seaweed
   Caulerpa sertularioides (Chlorophyta: Bryopsidales) from a sandy beach
   from Balandra Cove, on the south-eastern coast of the Baja California
   Peninsula, Mexico, between April 1998 and April 2000, including
   consecutive El Nino and La Nina events. El Nino conditions, indicated by
   relatively high seawater temperatures, were associated with a high
   population abundance (April-June 1998), whereas La Nina conditions,
   indicated by relatively low temperatures, were associated with the
   absence of C. sertularioides (April-June 1999 and April 2000). Caulerpa
   sertularioides was present during other times of the year during the
   study period, but never with the high abundance reached during El Nino
   conditions. Seaweeds of temperate affinity occurring in Baja California,
   such as Gelidium robustum (Rhodophyta: Gelidiales) and Macrocystis
   pyrifera (Phaeophyceae: Laminariales), decreased sharply in abundance
   during El Nino conditions. Therefore, the biogeographic affinity of
   seaweeds from Baja California might be helpful in predicting the effects
   of El Nino and La Nina on their abundance, with implications for
   resource management and for the prediction of the effects of long-term
   oceanographic changes on seaweed distribution.}},

   genetics of a Silene latifolia seed bank front southwestern Virginia. J.
   Torrey Bot. Soc. 128:400-406. 2001.-White campion (Silene latifolia) is
   a dioecious perennial that is the focus of an on-going meta population
   study in southwestern Virginia. In order to determine if a population in
   this study region maintained a dormant seed bank we collected soil
   cores, placed them in a greenhouse, and monitored emergence of white
   campion seedlings. The timing of soil core collection ensured that all
   white campion seeds in the soil were greater than or equal to10 mo old.
   We compared the genetic composition of the seed bank with that of the
   above ground plants and the seed crop produced that year by scoring
   individuals from each cohort for sex and genotype at 7 polymorphic
   isozyme loci. A total of 99 white campion seedlings emerged froth the 70
   cores collected (mean density of seedlings per core = 1.41 +/- 4.37, n =
   70 cores; 535.29 seedlings/m(2)). The frequency distribution for
   seedling density per core deviated significantly from that predicted by
   a Poisson distribution, and the results of this analysis indicate a
   clumped dispersion pattern. The observed genotype frequencies in each
   cohort did not differ significantly from Hardy-Weinberg predictions, and
   allele frequencies did not differ significantly between the above and
   below ground cohorts. Sex ratios in each cohort did not deviate
   significantly from 1:1. The results indicate that this white campion
   population maintains a dormant seed hank that provides an unbiased
   reservoir of genetic variation for the characters we investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence of possible worldwide amphibian population declines has
   highlighted the need for a better understanding of species-specific
   habitat associations and methodologies for monitoring long-term
   population trends. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is committed to
   incorporating salamander population monitoring into the park's long-term
   inventory and monitoring program because of the large number of unique
   species in the park, and evidence that salamanders are finely tuned
   indicators of environmental quality. We present data on spatial and
   temporal patterns in salamander diversity and abundance in Great Smoky
   Mountains National Park and compare the bias and effectiveness of 4
   common sampling techniques. We found that large-scale habitat
   characteristics, including disturbance history, proximity of streams,
   and elevation are useful to explain patterns of salamander distribution
   and abundance. With the exception of soil moisture, microhabitat
   variables were not helpful in understanding variations in salamander
   relative abundance. Data collected over 2 years suggest that common
   salamander sampling techniques vary significantly in their
   effectiveness. and they may often violate assumptions required for
   comparing salamander population indices over space or time. Salamander
   counts on our sites were highly variable. Neither sampling variability
   nor detectability were constant across habitat types or species. These
   characteristics reduce power for detecting long-term population trends
   and suggest that some common sampling methods may not provide indices
   suitable for long-term population monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{From 1990 to 2000, the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System
   (JACADS) incinerated part of the U.S. stockpile of chemical weapons on
   Johnston Atoll, central Pacific Ocean, which also is a National Wildlife
   Refuge and home to approximately a half-million breeding seabirds. The
   effect on wildlife of incineration of these weapons is unknown. Using a
   multi-strata mark-recapture analysis, we investigated the effects of
   JACADS on reproductive success, survival, and movement probabilities of
   red-tailed tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) nesting both downwind and
   upwind of the incineration site. We found no effect of chemical
   incineration on these tropicbird demographic parameters over the 8 years
   of our study. An additional 3 years of monitoring tropicbird demography
   will take place, post-incineration.}},

Abstract = {{The restoration of wildlife populations to historically occupied ranges
   is an important goal of modern wildlife management. In Arizona, USA,
   efforts have begun to reintroduce the Gould's subspecies of wild turkey
   (Meleagris gallopavo mexicana) into its former range in the southeastern
   part of the state. However, individuals or descendants of the Merriam's
   subspecies (M. g. merriami) may remain in the reintroduction area from
   earlier releases and could potentially interbreed with reintroduced
   Gould's turkeys. We used 3 fundamentally different genetic markers to
   determine whether the wild turkeys currently occupying the Huachuca
   Mountains in southeastern Arizona were descended From the Gould's
   turkeys translocated there during the 1980s, or whether interbreeding
   had occurred with descendants of Merriam's turkeys from a translocation
   during 1950. We found consistent genetic differences between relict
   Populations of the Merriam's turkey in Arizona and the Gould's turkey in
   northern Mexico. The Huachuca Mountains wild turkey population
   consistently grouped with the relict Gould's populations and showed no
   evidence of interbreeding with the Merriam's subspecies. In addition, we
   found evidence that the Huachuca Mountains population was less
   genetically diverse than the relict populations, and we recommend that
   this population be monitored for signs of inbreeding depression. The
   molecular markers developed for this study are important tools for
   future management of wild turkeys.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use changes and associated river discharges in coastal tropical
   regions present a global threat to coral reef environments. This study
   investigated the temporal variation in biological oxygen demand (BODS)
   and suspended particulate matter (SPM) at the mouths of seven rivers on
   Okinawa Island (Japan) over 20 years. We report strong positive
   relationships between human population densities within river catchment
   areas and both average BODS concentration (r(2) = 0.968; p < 0.001) and
   SPM (r(2) = 0.659; p < 0.003) at the mouths of the rivers. At the reef
   adjacent to one river (Hija River, 50.2 kin catchment area) we applied
   moving window analysis to assess an optimal sampling strategy for
   elucidating transitional boundaries in coral composition from the river
   mouth to a point where the effect of river discharge was minimal. The
   optimal window width for Okinawan rivers was five 1 m(2) quadrats spaced
   over 5 m intervals. This sampling strategy clearly showed dissimilarity
   spikes in coral community composition up to 400 m from the Hija River
   mouth, beyond which no significant differences in coral composition were
   detected using analysis of similarities (ANOSIM). We developed a simple
   diffusion model linking the rivers' maximum discharge rate, and the
   average concentration of BODS and SPM with the spatial impact on the
   coral communities. The diffusion model can aid in predicting negative
   shifts in coral communities expected to result from detrimental land-use
   changes and is an important tool for monitoring coral reefs. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Population studies of enteric bacteria in an agriculturally impacted
   stream (Ledbetter Creek, Murray, Kentucky, USA) were conducted over a
   period of 2 years. Total number of bacteria, cultivated heterotrophic
   aerobic bacteria, and enteric bacteria showed significant differences
   between winter and summer. The cultivated numbers of heterotrophic
   aerobic bacteria and enteric bacteria were significantly more abundant
   in summer than in winter. The abundance of enteric bacteria was 12.9\%
   in an upwelling zone and 9.8\% in a downwelling zone in summer. Most of
   the enteric bacterial strains isolated on MacConkey agar were assigned
   to Enterobacter cloacae and E. agglomerans by API 20E and an analysis of
   the restriction patterns produced by amplified DNA coding for 16S rRNA
   (ARDRA) with the enzyme Hpa II, E. cloacae and E. agglomerans genotypes
   isolated from three hyporheic and gravel bar depth intervals (0-10 cm,
   15-25 cm, and 30-40 cm) in summer and fall showed significant spatial
   variation and were heterogeneously distributed along the stream.
   Temperature, inorganic nutrients, and occurrence of anoxic zones
   affected the distribution of enteric bacteria. These techniques can be
   used as a model to monitor shifts among different species in the stream
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of soil amoebas were monitored in two salt marshes in Staten
   Island, NY for 2 years. One site, Gulfport Reach on the Arthur Kill, has
   been highly impacted by numerous oil spills. In particular, in 1990 a
   massive no. 2 fuel oil spill from a ruptured pipe flooded the area; its
   sediments had total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations in the
   range 800-46,000 ppm. A reference site I I km away, on the Atlantic
   coast, had low TPH levels. Amoeba population densities were in general
   higher in the impacted sediments. In laboratory microcosm experiments,
   sediment samples from unimpacted sites were treated with added fresh
   (unweathered) hydrocarbons (no. 2 fuel oil) and cultured; these also
   yielded higher amoeba numbers than untreated controls. Four distinct
   amoeba morphotypes were monitored. Changes in population levels of total
   amoebas were correlated in the two sites, particularly for morphotype 2
   (r = 0.83). The ratios of total amoebas to total bacterial numbers were
   also correlated (r = 0.85) between the sites. This suggests the amoebas
   may function as generalists, and that their trophic relation to
   bacterial prey is not much affected by the presence of petroleum
   hydrocarbons, but rather may reflect regional parameters such as ambient
   temperature or other physical factors.}},

Abstract = {{Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) is an invasive nonindigenous
   plant that negatively affects North American wetlands. In 1992, four
   host-specific insect herbivores were introduced from the plant's native
   range as biological control agents and are now established in over 30
   states and 10 Canadian provinces. Severe defoliation of purple
   loosestrife by Galerucella calmariensis L. and G. pusilla Duft.
   (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) selectively reduced purple loosestrife
   biomass by as much as 95\% at many early release sites. At three sites,
   mass emergence of new generation Galerucella adults resulted in
   localized, short-term attack on Rosa multiflora Thunb., Potentilla
   anserina L., and Decodon verticillatus (L.) Elliott. Individuals of the
   same plant species away from the immediate emergence areas and at other
   release sites remained undamaged, and we observed neither feeding nor
   oviposition on the same plants by overwintered adults. Attack did not
   persist into the next growing season, and nontarget plants grew and
   appeared vigorous the following year, while purple looscstrife remained
   suppressed. Such ``spillover{''} does not constitute a host shifts
   beetles are unable to complete development on these nontarget plants.
   Spillover effects have been observed in other biocontrol programs and do
   not affect distribution or abundance of nontarget species. We anticipate
   that occasional spillover with transient attack on nontarget species may
   occur at other release sites with high population densities of the
   Galerucella species. Careful monitoring is the best means to determine
   long-term impact.}},

Abstract = {{Three DNA-based genotyping techniques, bi-directional PCR amplification
   of specific allele (bi-PASA), single-stranded conformational.
   polymorphism (SSCP) and minisequencing, have been developed and compared
   for the detection of the S291G (insensitive acetylcholinesterase) and
   L1014F (insensitive sodium channel), mutations associated with
   azinphos-methyl and permethrin resistance, respectively, in the Colorado
   potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). Extraction of genomic DNA
   from individual neonates that were hatched from previously collected egg
   masses is the most efficient and reliable means to obtain suitable
   templates, in terms, of convenience, economy, speed and DNA quality.
   Bi-PASA, employing two allele-specific primers, appears to be the most
   efficient and rapid genotyping method for the simultaneous, detection of
   both resistant/susceptible homozygous (SS, RR) and heterozygous (SR)
   alleles. Its resolution, however, is strongly dependent on the quality
   of template genomic DNA. SSCP also: allows unambiguous genotyping,
   including the detection of heterozygous alleles, and is less dependent
   on template DNA quality, but requires a longer processing time.
   Minisequencing. is amenable to a 96-well microtiter plate format for the
   processing of a large number of samples and allows direct detection of
   resistant/susceptible homozygous alleles but is not as efficient as the
   PASA and SSCP in detecting heterozygous alleles. In considering the
   advantages and disadvantages of each technique, DNA-based genotyping is
   best employed in combinations, with the bi-PASA as the primary method
   and the SSCP and minisequencing as the secondary validating methods.
   These methods are rugged, rapid, cost-effective and capable of resolving
   SS, RR and SR individuals. The availability of such DNA-based genotyping
   techniques, using neonate genomic DNA as templates,, will enable the
   precise monitoring of the resistant and susceptible allele frequencies,
   including. those of heterozygote individuals, in field populations of L
   decemlineata. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents seasonal variation in certain sea urchin
   (Strongylocentrotus polyacanthus) characteristics in habitats of varying
   environmental conditions. At Shemya Island, Alaska, three habitat types
   {[}dense kelp beds, intermediate kelp beds, and algal barrens (low to no
   foliose algal cover)] were monitored seasonally from September 1995 to
   August 1996, for live and drift foliose algae. In general, drift algal
   abundance was greater in areas with more attached kelp, but this varied
   with season. Along with drift algae, sea urchin density, test size
   diameter, gonad and nutrition indices, and mobility were seasonally
   sampled within each habitat. Densities were highest in the algal barrens
   and lowest in the kelp beds. Seasonally, densities varied between
   summer/fall, and winter/spring, with lower numbers in the winter/spring.
   Test size was largest in the kelp habitats when compared to the
   intermediate or barren sites. Test size was seasonally consistent in the
   kelp habitats but not in the intermediate or barren sites. Here, test
   size did vary depending on season (larger urchins were found in winter).
   The gonad index showed much seasonal variation at the kelp and
   intermediate kelp sites, but was relatively more stable over time in the
   barren habitats. Between habitats, gonad and nutrition indices were
   larger in areas with kelp. Urchin movement varied seasonally between
   habitats, with more overall movement and variation in barren habitats.
   These results illustrate the importance of small-scale temporal and
   spatial variation. Monitoring for 1 year demonstrated that certain
   parameters varied more in areas of higher foliose algal cover (gonad
   indices), while other parameters varied more in low kelp areas (test
   size and movement). These results suggest that studies involving urchins
   should consider both time of year and overall algal community
   composition when conducting any type of experimental or monitoring work.}},

Abstract = {{Volcanic eruptions can present unpredictable hazards to populations
   living within regions containing potentially active volcanoes and for
   people traveling in jet aircraft that intersect with ash-laden eruption
   clouds. Methods of monitoring volcanic activity include searching for
   variations in the thermal signal from active fumaroles, lava domes, lava
   lakes, flows, and other features. Over many active volcanoes in the
   Western Hemisphere, low spatial resolution (4 km/pixel) weather
   satellite data acquired every 15 min are used to identify changes in
   eruptive activity, but are of insufficient spatial resolution to map
   active volcanic features. The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on
   Landsat 7 can be used to monitor active volcanoes at a higher spatial
   resolution (15- to 60-m pixels). ETM+ also offers improvements over its
   predecessor, the Thematic Mapper of Landsats 4 and 5, by way of a 15-m
   panchromatic band and higher spatial resolution (60 m/pixel) thermal
   infrared (IR) band. With higher spatial resolution panchromatic data, we
   are able to map lava flow fields, trace very high temperature lava
   channels, and, at Lascar volcano, identify an arcuate feature associated
   with a collapsed crater floor, a phenomenon that may precede explosive
   activity. With improved spatial resolution in the thermal IR, we are
   able to map the bifurcation and braiding of underground lava tubes at
   Kilauea. Identifying tube locations and tracking their extension are
   important because, for a given volumetric lava production (effusion)
   rate, tube-fed flows can extend a much greater distance than surface
   flows. At both Kilauea and Etna, we are able to use the thermal data to
   estimate effusion rates, an important parameter for assessing how far a
   flow is likely to extend and therefore the hazard it poses. An improved
   ETM+ data collection and distribution system includes a well-formulated
   and -executed Long-Term Acquisition Plan and less expensive data that is
   available much faster than previously possible. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The need for broadening a crop's genetic base may be determined by
   comparing allele frequencies within the gene pools of farmer selections
   in their centers of diversity with that of modern breeding populations.
   The genetic structure of Andean and Chilean potato farmer selections was
   investigated with the aid of nine isozymes, which have been studied in
   detail and used to characterize North American cultivars and advanced
   breeding lines. These isozymes are associated with the most-important
   agronomic or quality characters in the North American gene pool. By
   comparing these data with previous analyses of the North American gene
   pool, allozyme frequency changes for nine loci were monitored. Allozyme
   frequency changes were not always due to genetic drift, but resulted
   also from directional selection of isozyme marker linked quantitative
   trait loci (QTLs) affecting agronomic or quality characters. Changes in
   allozyme frequency can also occur as a consequence of pleiotropy, i.e.
   the isozyme itself may be involved in the expression of a phenotype.
   These allozyme frequency changes may reflect the manipulation of the
   potato genome by breeders. There were allozymes in some North American
   cultivars that were not observed in the farmer selections from the Andes
   and Chile. This confirms that breeders have already introgressed exotic
   genes from wild and other primitive cultivated tuber-bearing Solanum
   species. On this basis, the need for broadening the genetic base for
   specific chromosomes (or chromosome regions) should be based on analysis
   with these and other genetic markers available in potato.}},

Abstract = {{The Reconquista river is a typical example of the adverse impact of
   human activity on a watercourse. Approximately 10\% of the population of
   the country is settled on its basin,and it receives wastewater
   discharges from residences and industries. This paper describes the
   results of the first systematic data for measurement of pesticides in
   surface water of the river, based on a monthly monitoring program over
   two-year span. The analyses were performed, in three sampling stations
   (S-1, S-2 and S-3), along 46 km of its course, following the AOAC
   methods. Screening included the following pesticides: (a)
   Organochlorines: alpha, beta and gamma HCH; heptachlor, heptachlor
   epoxide; aldrin; endrin; dieldrin; op' and pp' DDT; op' and pp' DDE;
   alpha and gamma chlordane and endosulphan II; (b) Organophosphates:
   ethyl and methyl parathion; chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion. From the 60
   samples analyzed, 35\% contained organochlorine pesticides in a
   concentration higher than the detection limit. Organophosphates were
   found in no case. Throughout the studied period, DDT and its metabolite
   DDE were only found in S-1 and gamma chlordane in S-3; heptachlor was
   present in 50\% of the samples Of S-2 and in 35\% Of S-3, while HCH
   isomers were detected in 38\% Of S-2 and 45\% of S-3 samples. Neither
   temporal nor spatial trends were found. There was not a relationship
   between the time of samplings and the fumigation season for farming
   purposes, At all locations, pesticides levels were found to be between
   40 and 400 times higher than the legal limits established for protection
   of aquatic life. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Denitrification walls are a useful approach for removing nitrate from
   shallow groundwater, but little is known about the sustainability of
   nitrate removal, which is dependent on the continued supply of organic
   carbon to denitrifying bacteria. To address this question, we monitored
   nitrate removal, denitrification and carbon dynamics in a pilot-scale
   denitrification wall for 5 yr. The wall continuously removed more than
   95\% of the incoming nitrate in groundwater, which ranged from 5 to 15
   mg N L-1. We did not detect decreases in total carbon during the 5-yr
   study. Available carbon declined for the first 200 days after the wall
   was constructed but has since remained relatively constant. While
   microbial biomass has varied between 350 and 550 mug C g(-1) there was
   no downward trend, suggesting that carbon availability was not limiting
   the size of the microbial population. However, there was a large
   decrease in denitrifying population, as indicated by declines in
   denitrifying enzyme activity. Despite this decrease, denitrification
   rates have remained high enough to remove nitrate from groundwater and
   denitrification was limited by nitrate rather than by carbon. Our data
   demonstrates that there was sufficient available carbon in this
   denitrification wall to support denitrification and nitrate removal for
   at least 5 yr. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Predicted changes in regional precipitation patterns and soil moisture
   caused by anthropogenic trace gas emissions may affect the distribution
   and abundance of woody plants in and and semiarid regions. To test the
   response of woody plants to potential changes in precipitation regimes,
   we manipulated summer and winter precipitation on plots that contained
   seedlings of Quercus emoryi Torn (Emory oak), the dominant tree in oak
   savannas of the southwestern United States. Throughout the growing
   season, we monitored seedling survival and physiology (predawn leaf
   water potential, midday instantaneous gas exchange, and leaf carbon
   isotope discrimination). Seedling survival and physiological performance
   differed little between treatments, which embodied 50\% changes to
   quantities of summer and winter precipitation, and encompassed a
   continuum of precipitation from 359 mm (.) year(-1) to 846 mm (.)
   year(-1). However, survival and physiological performance of seedlings
   were negatively impacted by seasonal environmental conditions common to
   all treatments, especially during the annual pre-'monsoon' drought.
   Seedling predawn leaf water potentials, net CO2 assimilation, and
   stomatal conductance indicate that growing conditions for Q. emoryi
   seedlings at this site are generally restricted to periods with adequate
   soil moisture (i.e., April and August). Results contrast with an
   assumption implicit to the ``two-layer{''} soil water resource
   partitioning hypothesis that woody plants in all life history stages are
   more dependent upon winter than summer precipitation. In fact, summer
   precipitation appears more important than winter precipitation for Q.

Abstract = {{Three types of injuries commonly generated by biotic and abiotic agents
   on the periphery of coral colonies are tissue mortality, scraping
   injuries and breakage. To determine if recovery (amount of regeneration)
   was affected by injury type, colonies of Acropora hyacinthus and
   Montipora tuberculosa were inflicted with tissue, scraping and breakage
   injuries and their recovery monitored over 24 days. The influence of the
   tissue available for regeneration (i.e. the zone of tissue of bordering
   or partially injured polyps from which regeneration can occur) and the
   amount of settlement of algae on recovery was also measured for the
   different injury types and species. Overall, the amount of regeneration
   was up to four times greater for a scraping injury than tissue mortality
   and breakage. Furthermore, the amount of regeneration of the breakage
   injuries was approximately two-times greater for M. tuberculosa than for
   A. hyacinthus colonies. The regeneration rate of all injury types
   declined over time for both species. Recovery of injuries was influenced
   by the amount of algae that colonised the lesion and the zone of tissue
   available for regeneration. In general, the amount of regeneration of
   injuries was lower for injuries with a small zone of basal tissue
   available for regeneration, and the amount of regeneration was
   negatively correlated with the amount of algal settlement. The results
   of this study are important for understanding the role of partial
   mortality in the demography of scleractinian corals. Injuries impact on
   the population dynamics of colonies because regenerative processes
   require resources usually available for other processes (e.g. growth and
   reproduction), and slow recovery rates potentially increase the chance
   of whole colony mortality. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot study was conducted to determine the optimal survey design for
   an inventory of the commercially important rattan Calamus poilanei in
   central Lao PDR. Simulations were used to estimate the coefficients of
   variation (CVs) of population density estimates for alternative sampling
   designs, a model was developed to determine the optimal survey design
   which minimised survey time for a given survey precision and a
   statistical power analysis was used to determine whether these surveys
   were sufficiently sensitive to form part of a monitoring programme.
   Line survey and plot enumeration times were quite high due to moderately
   difficult terrain. The Cv (135\% for a 5 m x 50 m plot) was markedly
   higher than in some comparable studies. The CV could be predicted well
   from plot size but plot shape explained little additional variance. The
   optimum plot size varied but the 5 rn x 50 in plot was close to the
   optimal solution over a wide range of situations. Surveys with a
   precision of 20\% or better were predicted to be very time consuming.
   Power analysis indicated that a survey precision of 5 or 10\% was likely
   to be required if an annual monitoring programme was to be useful in
   detecting a decline in the population. To achieve this precision,
   surveys would have to be even more time consuming, and many `optimal'
   solutions were clearly impractical. For a resource of moderate value
   such as rattan cane, very prolonged or costly surveys such as these are
   most unlikely to be economically justified. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Reefs in the Florida Keys are experiencing a dramatic increase in the
   number of localities and number of species with coral disease. In
   extensive surveys from Key Largo to Key West in 160 stations at 40
   randomly chosen sites, there has been a dramatic increase in (1) the
   number of locations exhibiting disease (82\% of all stations are now
   affected, a 404\% increase over 1996 values), (2) the number of species
   affected (851,c of all species are now affected, a 218\% increase over
   1996 values), and (3) the rate of coral mortality (the deep fore-reef at
   Carysfort experienced a 60\% reduction of living coral cover during the
   survey). Two null hypotheses (1) that the incidence of disease has
   remained constant through time and (2) that the apparent increase in
   disease is due to a lack of comparable earlier data, are both falsified.
   Different diseases exhibit different patterns of spread: some diseases
   (e.g. black band) exhibit low incidence and jump rapidly between sites;
   other diseases (e.g. white pox) exhibit patchy distributions and
   increase in frequency at affected sites from one year to the next. The
   central question of why so many corals are becoming simultaneously
   susceptible to a host of marine pathogens remains unanswered.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous diseases in benthic marine organisms have been recognized over
   the last decade. Here, a new disease (pathogen unknown) is described and
   quantified in space and time for Palythoa caribaeorum (Cnidaria,
   Zoanthidea) populations on the Sao Paulo coast, Brazil (23degrees S).
   The degree of environmental stress (moderate vs. high), depth and
   temporal variation (seasons, years) on the frequency of the disease was
   assessed by monitoring plots at two sites: Ponta Recife (continent) and
   Praia Portinho (Sao Sebastiao island), and at two depths per site
   (0.5-1.5 m and 2.5-4 m). The disease spread outward from within the
   colony in a circular pattern. A transverse section extending from normal
   to diseased tissue showed a progression from normal polyps to pale,
   swollen polyps, followed by remnant spicule-like structures, and finally
   fine black matter and bare substratum in the middle of the lesion. The
   disease occurred in one or more portions of the colony simultaneously.
   Disease frequency and total area infected increased significantly with
   colony size. Generally, the disease affected less than or equal to 5\%
   of the total colony area, and occurred when gonad development was
   maximal. Therefore, 20.5\% (n = 306), and 14.6\% (n = 578) of the
   population was infected in two consecutive years, respectively. Disease
   exhibited higher rates during summer (tourist season) and fall, and
   decreased significantly in the winter with the presence of cool water.
   Factors associated with the increased instance of disease during the
   summer were higher temperatures, precipitation and sewage; the opposite
   was noted in the winter. Disease frequency varied significantly between
   years, seasons, sites and depths. Colonies exhibited higher disease
   frequency in Ponta Recife characterized by high levels of sedimentation,
   increased turbidity and low levels of incident light with respect to
   Praia Portinho. Colonies in shallow water exhibited greater frequency of
   disease compared to those in deeper water. Physiological stress, low
   energy input, energy expenditure and energy re-allocation may increase
   the susceptibility of P. caribaeorum colonies to disease. It is
   suggested that this disease may play an important role in the life
   history of P. caribaeorum because of its influence on partial mortality,
   colony area, population size structure, reproduction and ultimately
   fitness. This represents the first report of disease-related mortality
   in reef zoanthids of the Southwestern Atlantic.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat sinks can attract dispersing animals if high mortality or
   breeding failure are difficult to detect (e.g., when due to human
   hunting or pollution). Using a simple deterministic model, we explore
   the dynamics of such source-sink systems considering three scenarios: an
   avoided sink, no habitat preference, and an attractive sink. In the
   second two scenarios, there is a threshold proportion of sink habitat
   above which the whole population decreases to extinction, but this
   extinction threshold varies with habitat preference and the relative
   qualities of the two habitat types. Hence, it would be necessary to know
   the habitat preferences of any species in a source-sink system to
   interpret data on population increases and declines. In the attractive
   sink scenario, small changes in the proportion of sink habitat may have
   disproportionate effects on the population persistence. Also, small
   changes in growth rates at the source and the sink severely affect the
   threshold and the time of extinction. For some combinations of
   demographic parameters and proportion of habitat sink, the decline
   affects the source first; thus, during some time, it will be hidden to
   population monitoring at the sink, where numbers can even increase. The
   extinction threshold is also very sensitive to the initial population
   sizes relative to carrying capacity. Attractive sinks represent a novel
   aspect of source-sink dynamics with important conservation and
   management implications.}},

Title = {{Integrated management to address the incidental mortality of seabirds in
   longline fisheries}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Of the myriad of anthropogenic and natural threats to seabirds, one
   of the most critical global problems is incidental mortality in longline
   fisheries. Hesitance or failure by fishery managers and longline
   industries to adequately address this acute problem could result in the
   extinction of several albatross and petrel species within our lifetimes.
   2. An integrated management approach is needed to comprehensively manage
   longline fisheries to address seabird bycatch. A review of relevant
   multilateral accords, declarations and actions by regional and
   international organizations reveals the need to augment international
   collaboration, especially to address pirate longline fishing. Management
   authorities and stakeholders need to collaborate to: promote adoption
   and compliance with effective legally binding accords that cover the
   ranges of all affected seabirds; ensure that all Range States and
   relevant distant water fishing nations become contracting parties to
   these accords; coordinate national implementation of the Food and
   Agriculture Organization's International Plan of Action on seabirds; set
   management goals; establish and implement policies to employ seabird
   deterrent measures; disseminate information on new deterrent measures;
   locally tailor seabird deterrent measures; standardize data reporting
   and establish a centralized data repository; coordinate research and
   monitoring; develop regional surveillance and enforcement systems; and
   augment less developed countries' capacity and resources to mitigate
   seabird and longline fishery interactions.
   3. Establishing protected areas containing seabird colonies and adjacent
   waters within a nation's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is potentially an
   expedient method to reduce interactions between seabirds and longline
   fisheries. However, establishing high seas marine protected areas to
   restrict longline fishing in seabird foraging areas, which would require
   extensive and dynamic boundaries and large buffer zones, may not be a
   viable short-term solution due to the long time it is anticipated it
   could take to resolve legal complications with international treaties,
   to achieve international consensus and political will, and to acquire
   requisite extensive resources for surveillance and enforcement. High
   seas marine protected areas may eventually become a feasible mechanism
   to address seabird bycatch if nations develop the will to close ocean
   areas to commercial fisheries to attempt to rehabilitate depleted
   pelagic fish stocks.
   4. Direct involvement of longline industries, through partnerships with
   national governments and regional organizations, to develop seabird
   mitigation measures and policies prescribing the use of these measures,
   is critical. Direct involvement of stakeholders to find solutions to
   resource management problems leads to stakeholder groups taking
   ownership of and supporting rules. Bottom-up approaches are successful
   in changing interest groups' attitudes and behaviour, to maximize
   voluntary compliance and minimize conflict and resources required for
   enforcement.
   5. Data gaps must be filled and scientific uncertainty addressed through
   multilateral collaboration. Research to develop and improve practicable
   mitigation measures is most urgently needed. Information on the status
   and trends of albatross populations, where albatrosses forage, the
   causes of population declines, seabird mortality rates and levels in
   each longline fishery, and the type of impacts from longlining on
   seabird populations is also needed. It is well documented that several
   seabird species are at risk of extinction, incidental bycatch in
   longline fisheries significantly contributes to many species' decline,
   and proven mitigation measures are available. Thus, while additional
   research is critically needed, we should not delay taking precautionary
   action to wait for additional information, but should immediately act to
   protect seabirds from the known acute threat of mortality in longline
   fisheries. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ten narwhals (Monodon monoceros) were instrumented with satellite-linked
   radio transmitters in Tremblay Sound in August 1997 (N = 5) and August
   1998 (N = 5). All whales stayed in the waters around Bylot Island until
   the end of September. On the basis of these animals and others tagged
   previously (total N = 24), it is believed that the Bylot Island
   summering population has limited or no contact with other summering
   populations in Canada or Greenland. Four whales were monitored during
   their southward movement along the east coast of Baffin Island. Three of
   them travelled close to the shore, visiting several fjords and bays,
   during September and October. The fourth whale started the southward
   migration at the same time as the other three, but it returned to the
   area east of Pond Inlet and made two trips northeast of Bylot Island. It
   headed south on 21 October 1998. South of Royal Society Fiord, it
   travelled offshore along the continental slope (1000 to 1500 m),
   probably because of ice formation in inshore areas. This narwhal and
   another male tagged in 1997 moved east toward the northern parts of the
   Davis Strait, reaching an area midway between Canada and Greenland in
   early November. Their winter movements were monitored until 30 January.
   The same wintering area in northern Davis Strait was previously
   documented for two male narwhals tracked from Melville Bay, NW
   Greenland, in 1993 and 1994. The whales showed a preference for deep
   areas, including deep fjords and the continental slope, where depths
   ranged between 500 and 1500 m. Even deeper areas, where maximum daily
   dives exceeded 1000 m, were also visited occasionally.}},

Abstract = {{Although territorial defense is a common form of reproductive
   competition among male vertebrates, the exact reproductive consequences
   of this behavior are often poorly understood. To explore relationships
   between territoriality and reproductive success in a nongroup-living
   mammal, we quantified patterns of space use, mating success, and
   fertilization success for males in a free-living population of arctic
   ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii plesius). Because litters of this
   species are sired almost exclusively by a female's first mate, we
   predicted that territory ownership would be associated with first access
   to estrous females. During the 2-week period when mating occur-red, each
   male in the study population attempted to defend a distinct portion of
   the habitat, although the success of this defense varied among
   individuals. Twenty-six of 28 females monitored mated with the male on
   whose territory they resided. However, the majority of females observed
   throughout estrus (65\%; n = 20) also mated with at least one other ale,
   indicating that territory ownership was not associated with, exclusive
   access to females. In contrast, territory oivnership was significantly
   associated with first access to estrous females; 20 (71.4\%) of 28
   females mated first with the male on whose territory they resided. In
   this regard, the behavior of S. parryii plesius parallels that of
   socially monogamous birds in which territorial defense by males
   functions to deter extrapair copulations by females. Although
   territorial defense represents an important component of male
   reproductive success in arctic ground squirrels, other aspects of male
   behavior (e.g., the ability to dominate agonistic interactions on the
   day of a female's estrus) are also critical. We suggest that future
   studies of vertebrate mating systems will benefit by viewing such
   defense as only one of multiple axes along which conspecific males
   compete for access to females.}},

Abstract = {{For the immediately threatened forests and bromeliads in the highlands
   of Chiapas, Mexico, we suggest an empirical approach to attain
   sustainability in the gathering of bromeliads for home decoration. On
   the basis of theoretical considerations and the results from a pilot
   study in three forest stands along a disturbance gradient at La
   Florecilla, we propose that harvesting should be limited to populations
   (1) that have a density no less than 9000 large rosettes/ha, (2) that
   are evenly distributed in space, and (3) that grow in the lower stratum
   of the forest, thus having little effect on their reproductive capacity.
   In a second study at La Florecilla we used a plotless point-centred
   quarter method to estimate the population density and homogeneity in
   spatial distribution of all species of bromeliads in the structurally
   heterogeneous forest. We found one species, Tillandsia vicentina, that
   met the prerequisites, having both a satisfactory average population
   density of ca. 24,000 large ( > 20 cm) rosettes/ha on oaks and a
   spatially even distribution. We estimate that an annual harvest of
   112,000 rosettes of T. vicentina from the lower stratum of the 160 ha
   forest at La Florecilla can be maintained, in a 4-year rotation cycle.
   The implementation of a monitoring program should be included in any
   management plan. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The status of the Gobi khulan Equus hemionus subsp. is recorded as
   ``insufficiently known{''} in the Species Survival Commission's Equid
   Action Plan. Recent counts confirm that Mongolia holds the most
   important population of the whole species. Since 1953, the animals have
   benefited from a protected status, but this is now challenged. A 5-year
   study in the B part of the Gobi National Park on one subpopulation
   showed that it has remained stable over the past 15 years with an
   adequate mean reproductive rate of 15\% and a 50\% survival rate over
   the first year. Age/sex related mortality and prey analysis indicate
   that wolf predation probably has some impact on the population, in
   particular for 4-6-year-olds of both sexes at the start of reproduction.
   Desert and mountain steppes are the khulan's year-round preferred
   habitat, but `oases', play an important role at the beginning of
   lactation. Anthropogenic factors affect both home range and habitat use
   through direct intervention or permanent occupation of the scarce water
   sources. Khulans of this subpopulation, unlike other Asian and African
   wild asses, form year-round stable, non-territorial families. These
   families and all-male groups join together into ``bands{''} in winter,
   and herds of several hundred animals, where reproductive rate is
   highest, form throughout the year. The existence of such herds may thus
   be critical for the breeding success of the population. Our study
   provides the first detailed quantitative data for this subspecies, which
   will help to monitor changes in the future. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Parasitism of the leafhopper Sophonia rufofascia (Kuoh and Kuoh), a
   recent immigrant that has become a widespread pest in Hawaii, was
   examined in a 1-year survey in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Samples
   of young leaves of four plant species infested with eggs of S.
   rufofascia were collected at five sites ranging from 880 to 1190 in in
   elevation. Leafhopper eggs were parasitized principally by three species
   of Mymaridae (Hymenoptera): Polynema sp., Schizophragma sp. probably
   bicolor (Dozier), and Chaetomymar sp. Although parasitism by each
   species fluctuated at levels usually below 10\%, all three were detected
   consistently across most host plants, sites, and sample periods. Total
   parasitism differed at a marginally significant level among host plants
   and sites, but not among sample periods. Total parasitism averaged
   14.3\% (maximum: 26.3\%) on Dodonaea viscosa Jacquin, 10.6\% (maximum:
   17.5\%) on Myrica faya Aiton, 8.7\% (maximum: 29.5\%) on Metrosideros
   polymorpha Gaudich-Beaupre, and 1.6\% (maximum: 4.3\%) on Vaccinium
   reticulatum Smith. Parasitism was generally higher at sites lower in
   elevation. Further monitoring is recommended to determine whether
   parasitism will increase to levels that can effectively suppress S.
   rufofascia populations. The efficacy of natural enemies already present
   in Hawaii is important because concern over nontarget impacts on endemic
   leafhoppers makes introduction of new biological control agents
   difficult. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

   reproductive potential of female survivors, egg viability, and total egg
   production within cohorts of adult western corn rootworm, Diabrotica

   mated and then treated with a suspension of B. bassiana (5 X 10(7)
   conidia/ml) 5, 10, or 15 days later. Egg production and percentage hatch
   were monitored over a 6-week period. Females surviving treatment at 10
   days postemergence produced on average 30\% fewer eggs during the
   initial 2 weeks of the oviposition period compared with other treatment
   schedules or untreated beetles. Overall reproductive capacity (mean No.
   eggs/female) was significantly lower in cohorts treated with B. bassiana
   compared with untreated cohorts, primarily clue to differential
   mortality. Early treatment of beetles (5 days postemergence) resulted in
   a greater reduction in total egg production within the cohort compared
   with later treatments (10 and 15 days postemergence). Egg viability
   declined significantly over time for all treatments with no difference
   in percentage hatchability of eggs between treated and untreated
   females. A properly timed application of B. bassiana causing 75\% beetle
   mortality could potentially reduce oviposition within adult populations

Abstract = {{On 22 September 1998, Hurricane Georges passed over the Dominican
   Republic causing extensive damage to a 4700 ha mangrove forest that has
   been the site of a detailed study of vegetation and ecosystem dynamics
   since 1994. We resurveyed the vegetation in permanent plots at 7 and IS
   months after the hurricane to document structural damage of the forest
   and evaluate early recovery patterns. The intensity of damage was patchy
   across the landscape. Mortality (greater than or equal to5 cm DBH)
   ranged from 14 to 100 percent (by density) among the 23 different plots
   and averaged 47.7 percent across all plots. Reductions in total basal
   area ranged from 9 to 100 percent, averaging 42.4 percent. Mortality
   increased by 9 percent between surveys at 7 and IS months
   post-hurricane. Interspecific. differences in susceptibility to wind
   damage appeared to be a primary factor contributing to spatial patterns
   in mortality. Laguncularia racemosa experienced much less mortality
   (26\%) than either Rhizophora mangle (50\%) or Avicennia germinans
   (64\%), and plot-level mortality was strongly associated with
   differences in species composition. There were no clear relationships
   between canopy height and tree damage at this site. Over 80 percent of
   the of the surviving R. mangle trees exhibited less than 50 percent
   crown damage, whereas ca 60 percent of the L. racemosa survivors
   suffered almost complete (75-100\%) crown loss. By IS months after the
   hurricane, the percentage of L. racemosa trees in the 75 to 100 percent
   damage class was reduced to 20 percent; in contrast, the health of many
   R. mangle individuals appeared to be declining, as the percentage of
   trees in the 50 to 100 percent damage class increased from 16 to 56
   percent. Understory light levels, as measured by the gap light index,
   increased from an average value of 3 percent in the pre-hurricane forest
   to 51 percent at 7 months after the hurricane and decreased slightly to
   47 percent at 18 months. Few saplings (>1 in call and <5 cm DBH)
   survived the hurricane; 72 percent of the tagged individuals in
   transect-based plots and 66 percent of saplings in pre-hurricane canopy
   gaps were killed. Seedling and sapling populations of all three species
   appear to be recovering rapidly although their densities stilt are lower
   than in the pre-hurricane forest. It is too early to predict the
   trajectory of forest recovery, and continued monitoring of the spatial
   and temporal patterns of forest development is needed to improve our
   understanding of the role that large-scale disturbance events play on
   the dynamics of mangrove forest ecosystems.}},

   Relationships between cyanobacterial abundance and environmental factors

Abstract = {{While benthic, filamentous cyanobacteria can be common on coral reefs,
   the factors influencing their distribution are poorly understood.
   Cyanobacterial blooms, like macroalgal blooms, may result from a
   combination of coastal eutrophication and reduced herbivory. Because
   benthic cyanobacteria are unpalatable to generalist herbivores, there
   may be little top-down control of cyanobacterial abundance. Since
   bottom-up factors may exert more influence on cyanobacterial
   populations, we hypothesized that high cyanobacterial abundance may be
   an indicator of high nutrient availability. In addition, cyanobacteria
   may compete with macroalgae for light and nutrients. Thus, we also
   hypothesized that cyanobacterial abundance may be negatively associated
   with macroalgal abundance. Since many strains of cyanobacteria wash
   ashore during periods of high wave action, we hypothesized that
   cyanobacterial abundance is negatively associated with wave height. We
   monitored cyanobacterial abundance, macroalgal abundance, nitrogen
   availability, phosphorus availability, salinity, and water temperature
   at nine reef flat locations around Guam. Average wave height for eastern
   and western shores, rainfall, minutes of sunshine, and wind speed were
   also monitored. Stepwise regression was used to determine which variable
   or combination of variables best explained variation in cyanobacterial
   abundance. Although nutrient availability was not significantly
   associated with cyanobacterial abundance, a positive association with
   macroalgal abundance explained 11.5\% of the observed variation in total
   cyanobacterial abundance. At one site, negative relationships with
   macroalgal abundance and wave height explained 79.4\% of the observed
   variation in the abundance of the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria
   margaritifera. Variation in cyanobacterial abundance can be best
   explained by examining individual strains of cyanobacteria, rather than
   by treating all cyanobacteria as a single ecological unit. Physical
   disturbance can be a more important influence on cyanobacterial
   abundance and distribution than either nutrient availability or
   interactions with macroalgae.}},

Abstract = {{Artisanal fishermen possess a wealth of knowledge about their
   environment and the dynamics of fish populations. This study uses an
   eco-anthropological approach to document and map the resource and
   spatial knowledge of coral reef fishermen in the Diani region of Kenya.
   The objective of the study is to document fishermen's knowledge, and to
   assess the nature and utility of information used by fishermen as a
   basis for resource management. As the foundation of their livelihoods,
   fishermen possess mental `monitoring mechanisms' for assessing trends in
   the fishery and show a high awareness of the issues involved in mapping,
   recording catch data, and analysis of the information. This paper
   presents an overview of a participatory monitoring study with artisanal
   fishermen, to try and adapt their existing assessment mechanisms to
   paper and computing. Data collection focussed on variables important to
   fishermen in their daily activities, i.e., the captain and crew, gear
   used, sites selected for fishing, the total weight of catch and the
   types of fish caught. This paper focuses on some of the issues raised by
   the process of participatory monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Functional roles of sponges in coral reef ecosystems include: increasing
   coral survival by binding live corals to the reef frame and preventing
   access to their skeletons by excavating organisms, mediating
   regeneration of physically damaged reefs by temporary stabilization of
   carbonate rubble; reworking of solid carbonate through bioerosion;
   recycling nutrients and adding to primary production through microbial
   symbionts with special biochemical capabilities; clearing the water
   column of procaryotic plankton; serving as food for a variety of
   megafauna; and attracting support for responsible human stewardship of
   coral reefs with aesthetically appealing colors and morphologies.
   Nevertheless, sponges tend to be avoided in assessment and monitoring of
   coral reefs because they are not easy to quantify or identify, and
   because we have only recently begun to understand the importance of
   their many functional roles. As we gain more understanding of these
   roles of sponges in coral reefs, the need to carefully assess and
   monitor changes in sponges is becoming more clear. Focus on functional
   roles dictates choice of methods for assessing and monitoring sponges,
   as follows: (1) volume will generally be the most useful way to quantify
   sponge populations; (2) accurate identification to genus, family, or
   even order, combined with a brief description and reference to voucher
   specimens, is preferable to guesses on species names, in cases for which
   identification can't be verified by specialists; (3) permanently marked
   sites must be monitored over time in order to be able to detect
   community changes and to distinguish beneficial from detrimental effects
   of sponges on corals.}},

Abstract = {{The rate at which obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana
   (Harris), larvae vacated feeding sites in apple, Malus domestica:
   Borkhauser (Rosaceae), trees was determined by monitoring infested
   terminal foliage under field conditions. The overwintering and summer
   generations of C. rosaceana were monitored in two orchards in 1997 and
   1998. Larvae vacated terminal feeding sites relatively frequently
   because 50\% of the sites during the overwintering and summer
   generations were vacant 34 +/- 6degreesd (threshold = 6degreesC) and 53
   +/- 10degreesd, respectively, after sites had been marked. Vacancy rates
   increased from the beginning to the end of the summer generation in 1997
   but remained relatively constant throughout the summer generation in
   1998. The differences between the 2 years were probably because of less
   precipitation and lower availability of actively growing terminal
   foliage at the end of the summer in 1997 than in 1998. Differences in
   larval development did not seem to contribute to differences in vacancy
   rate. Recolonization of growing terminals was also studied in the field
   by removing C. rosaceana larvae from terminals only (1997) and the
   entire tree (1998). In 1997 and 1998, larval recolonization of terminals
   and trees occurred, because 6-8 d after larvae were removed populations
   in removal and adjacent control trees were not significantly different.
   Frequent larval movement to actively growing terminal foliage with
   sublethal insecticide residues may increase larval survival and could
   slow resistance development by providing a refuge for susceptible
   insects.}},

Abstract = {{Management of sustainable fisheries depends upon reliable estimates of
   stock assessment. Assessment of many stocks is based entirely on
   fishery-dependent data (e.g., catch per unit effort), which can be
   problematic. Here we use fishery-independent data on stock size,
   collected within and outside of no-take reserves before and after the
   onset of fishing, to evaluate the status of the dive fishery for warty
   sea cucumbers, Parastichopus parvimensis, in southern California.
   Long-term monitoring data showed that abundance decreased throughout the
   Channel Islands within 3-6 years after the onset of fishing. No
   significant changes in the abundance of P. parvimensis were observed at
   the two non-fished reserve sites, although densities tended to increase
   following onset of the fishery. Before-after, control-impact (BACI)
   analyses of seven fished and two non-fished sites implicated fishing
   mortality as the cause of 33-83\% stock declines. In sharp contrast,
   stock assessment based on CPUE data showed no declines and a significant
   increase at one island. To date, most discussion on marine reserves has
   focused on the protection and enhancement of exploited populations. Our
   study demonstrates the critically important, but often overlooked, role
   that marine reserves can play in providing reliable information on stock
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{To determine if frugivorous bats in tropical dry forest differentially
   use a particular habitat and if this use is related to their
   reproductive patterns, I monitored populations from one site from
   January 1994 to January 1997 in Parque Nacional Palo Verde in
   northwestern Costa Rica. Abundance, reproductive condition, sex ratio,
   age-classes, and recapture data were compared across seasons and years.
   During 56 nights of sampling, 13 species of frugivores and 5
   nectarivores were captured (N = 998). Carollia perspicillata, Artibeus
   jamaicensis, and Sturnira lilium were significantly more abundant in
   1994 than in 1995 or 1996. Carollia perspicillata and A. jamaicensis
   were captured year-round, but there were peaks of abundance in the dry
   season and the middle of the rainy season. Sixteen percent of 244 adult
   female C. perspicillata and 20\% of 87 A. jamaicensis were reproductive,
   principally in February through June. Forty-three percent of 28 adult
   female S. lilium were reproductive from February to June and in October
   and December. Fifty-four percent of 26 adult female Centurio senex were
   reproductive between December 1995 and February 1996. Few subadults were
   captured at this site. Sex ratios were significantly different across
   seasons for C. perspicillata and A. jamaicensis. Seventy-three C.
   perspicillata were recaptured and 25 (34\%) of these were recaptured
   after more than 4 months. The results of this study indicate that the
   abundance of some tropical frugivorous bats varies between years and
   (or) over seasons at a particular site within tropical dry forest.}},

Abstract = {{For the control of the Onchoeerca volvulus vector in West Africa, up to
   18,000 km of rivers from 1975 and up to 50,000 km from 1999 had been
   partly sprayed weekly with insecticides as part of the Onchocerciasis
   Control Programme (OCP). To evaluate the Possible short-term and
   long-term effects of the application of insecticides on the nontarget
   fauna, an aquatic monitoring programme was set up during the initial
   phase of the programme. By analysing the invertebrate data, which were
   collected using various sampling strategies from four different
   countries between 1977 and 1996, this paper evaluates the long-term
   changes of the invertebrate populations with respect to their taxonomic
   composition as well as their trophic structures. The discussed results
   of the applied numerical analysis strategy suggest that neither the
   taxonomic nor the trophic structures are greatly altered from the range
   of biological, flow-related variation that normally occurs in the
   studied river systems. This allows us to conclude that the biological
   variation found here is ecologically acceptable. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The potential of using composting technology to remediate clayey soils
   with high levels of crude oil contamination was evaluated. An open air
   windrow comprised of flare pit soil, manure and wood chips was

   were monitored for ten months. Temperature profile of this windrow gave
   cyclic patterns of high and low temperature recordings corresponded to
   the turning events. Most of the microbial metabolic activity occurred
   within the mesophilic temperature range and the hydrocarbon degrading
   microorganism populations remained high throughout the trial. Complete
   removal of BTEX compounds was achieved within six months and extractable
   carbons from C-5 to C-10 were reduced by 98.7\% compared to the initial
   contaminated soil. Vegetative growth on the composted soil was also
   evaluated. Barley and timothy plants grown in the composted soil were
   compared to the control off-lease soil, contaminated soil, and other
   treatments of varying salinity and organic matter levels. Plant
   germination, survival, and biomass production was significantly better

Abstract = {{Coral reefs support very diverse fish assemblages and a wide variety of
   coral species are important resources for many species of coral-reef
   fishes (Choat and Bellwood 1991). The global mass coral bleaching event
   reported to have occurred in all the major tropical oceans of the world
   in 1998 has resulted in a dramatic loss of live coral (reviewed by
   Hoegh-Guldberg 1999). It is critical to collect as much information as
   possible about the effects of such natural disturbances on coral-reef
   fishes.
   Among coral-reef fishes, the species that are most likely to be affected
   by coral disturbances are obligate coral-dwelling or -feeding species,
   including numerous darnselfishes (Pomacentridae), gobies (Gobiidae), and
   butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) (McIlwain and Jones 1997). The longnose
   filefish, Oxymonacanthus longirostris, a small monacanthid (maximum 9 cm
   in standard length) is a common inhabitant of shallow coral reefs in the
   Indo-West Pacific and is a specialised coral-polyp feeder. This fish
   lives in an exclusive and heterosexual pair, with the male and female
   sharing the same feeding territory (i.e., pair territoriality: Barlow
   1987; Kokita and Nakazono 1999). Pairs spend most of the day feeding
   almost entirely on the polyps of corals of the genus Acropora (Sano et
   al. 1984; Barlow 1987). Because acroporid corals are one of the most
   susceptible groups of corals to bleaching (e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg and
   Salvat 1995; Fujioka 1999; McClanahan 2000), we expected that O.
   longirostris would be severely affected by the mass bleaching event.
   The bleaching event on Japanese coral reefs occurred in the summer of
   1998 and caused extensive coral mortality (Tsuchiya 1999). Here, we
   document the effect of this severe coral bleaching event on an O.
   longirostris population at Okinawa Island, Japan. In this study, a local
   population of this species was monitored successively both in 1997 (year
   without the bleaching) and 1998 (year with the bleaching) and the
   results of the two years were compared.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of prey encountering intense predation varies by
   species, prey density, and habitat type; however, the collective impact
   of these factors has rarely been tested experimentally in natural marine
   systems. Using the thin-shelled clams Mya arenaria and Macoma balthica
   as prey, and the main epibenthic predator of whole adult clams, the blue
   crab Callinectes sapidus, we conducted a series of experiments in
   Chesapeake Bay tributaries that (1) links field abundance and
   distribution of bivalve prey species with habitat-specific mortality
   patterns; (2) represents the first comprehensive field test of
   species-specific, habitat-specific, and density-dependent mortality for
   subtidal, soft-bottom, deep-burrowing prey; and (3) thereby enables
   development of a conceptual model to be used as a heuristic tool linking
   predator-prey dynamics, habitat type, and evolutionary defense tactics
   for marine benthos.
   In 15 years of field monitoring, Mya was more common in sand than mud
   habitats, and Macoma was widely distributed and at higher densities than
   Mya in mud and sand. In field experiments, mortality of both Mya and
   Macoma was density dependent in those habitats where the clams are
   common. The blue crab population in the field exhibited a type III
   ``guild functional response{''} on Mya in sand, and on Macoma in both
   mud and sand. Mortality was lower in sand than mud for Mya, and similar
   in mud and sand for Macoma, correlating with the high abundances of Mya
   in sand and Macoma in sand and mud. The persistence of large juvenile
   and adult bivalves when confronted with intense predation derived
   substantially from a low-density refuge from predation that varied in a
   species-specific manner with habitat type, demonstrating the
   species-specific importance of density and habitat to clam survival.
   We developed a conceptual model detailing the relative importance of
   behavior, morphology, habitat features, and the basic components of
   predator-prey interactions to the survival of bivalve molluscs. At one
   extreme are bivalve molluscs, such as oysters, that emphasize
   morphological refuges that increase the predator's handling time. At the
   other extreme are bivalves, such as Mya and Macoma, that reduce predator
   encounter rates. The model is intended to be used as a heuristic tool to
   develop testable hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{I examined the degree to which population sizes of North American
   wintering birds exhibit spatial synchrony (autocorrelation) and local
   disappearances based on 30 yr of Christmas Bird Counts. The primary goal
   of these analyses was to determine whether processes expected in
   metapopulations, including low spatial synchrony, frequent local
   disappearances, and colonization leading to population rescue, play
   important roles in species that are not necessarily subdivided into
   discrete patches. In general, spatial autocorrelation was less than
   expected based on environmental factors, with only one-third of species
   significantly spatially autocorrelated between sites up to 100 km apart
   and only three (1\%) spatially autocorrelated on a continental scale.
   Spatial autocorrelation was significantly lower for primarily aquatic
   compared to terrestrial species and tended to be higher among small,
   widely distributed, and relatively abundant species with more northern
   winter distributions and low relative population variability. Local
   disappearances (years when no individuals were detected) were also
   common and tended to last longer in aquatic, migratory species high in
   the food chain. When controlling for confounding factors, there was a
   significant positive relationship between spatial synchrony and the
   length of disappearances among resident species, as expected if
   population rescue contributes to interspecific variation in these
   parameters. These results support the hypothesis that processes expected
   in metapopulations may be important in many resident bird species. They
   also provide insight as to which species are more vulnerable to global
   extinction as well as those for which monitoring efforts aimed at
   detecting large-scale population declines may be performed efficiently
   by extrapolating from data acquired at relatively few sites.}},

Abstract = {{Swine (Sus scrofa) have been introduced in many places throughout the
   world, and in many places they adversely affect the environment,
   economically impact agriculture, and/or harbour diseases transmittable
   to domestic livestock or humans. An easily applied method to assess
   their abundance is an important need for their management. To monitor
   efficacy of a swine control programme in Florida, data from passive
   tracking plots provide an index of feral swine abundance. The same track
   data coupled wit plot locations to numerically describe the spatial
   pattern of swine activity gave an index of pervasiveness, and a simple
   rate of interception of damage sites to index damage was used. The
   assessments were conducted in January, May, and August 2000 in Jonathan
   Dickinson State Park, Florida, USA. Between the first two assessments a
   swine control programme removed 25 feral swine from the 8.3 km(2) study
   area, after which the value of the passive tracking index was reduced by
   81\% and the fresh damage index by 89\%, while the index of spatial
   pattern (pervasiveness index) showed only a small localized
   concentration after control. In the three months following the second
   assessment, Park personnel removed three additional swine from the study
   area, and a follow-up assessment indicated slightly less swine activity
   than immediately after the post-control assessment, however the index of
   pervasiveness showed a similar spatial pattern of activity as the
   initial assessment, possibly indicating re-invasive pressure. The
   passive tracking plots proved to be an uncomplicated, easily applied
   means to gather data for assessing and comparing swine abundance and
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoridated salt is an effective method to reduce dental decay in the
   population at large, in particular in settings where the more frequently
   used method of fluoridated water is not feasible due to unreliable water
   supplies. A salient problem of regular dosage and monitoring of fluoride
   in salt is its variable level at the industrial level. To evaluate the
   relative advantages of the present monitoring method used in Mexico,
   samples of domestic fluoridated salt were analysed by two comparative
   methods to determine their fluoride content. One of the methods employed
   was the relevant Mexican Official Norm (based on an acetic acid, sodium
   chloride, trans-1,2-diamine, cyclohexane N,N,N ` ,N ` tetracetic acid
   buffer solution) and the other was an alternative electrochemical
   methodology (based on an acetic acid, sodium chloride, sodium citrate
   buffer solution). The cost of the chemicals involved and simplicity of
   the alternative method, along with the equivalent precision of its
   results, makes it an interesting choice for the large scale analysis of
   fluoridated salt. (C) 2001 AEHS.}},

   enrolled children aged 1-11 years from the general population of five
   socioeconomically matched pairs of nonurban communities in northern
   England. Diaries of respiratory events were collected for 1405 children,
   and information was collected on the consultations of 2442 children with
   family/general practitioners over the 6-week study periods during
   1996-1997, with concurrent monitoring of particulate levels. The
   associations found between daily PM10 levels and respiratory symptoms
   were frequently small and positive and sometimes varied between
   communities. The magnitude of these associations were in line with those
   from previous studies, even though daily particulate levels were low,
   and the children were drawn from the general population, rather than
   from the population with respiratory problems. The associations among
   asthma reliever use, consultations with general practitioners, and daily
   particulate levels were of a similar strength but estimated less
   precisely. The strength of association between all respiratory health
   measures and particulate levels was similar in communities near and away

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated no difference in micronucleus (MN)
   frequencies between wild rodents chronically exposed to the
   environmental radiation contamination of the Chornobyl (Ukraine)
   exclusion zone and those inhabiting reference populations. The aim of
   the present study was to test the hypothesis that a population of bank
   votes (Clethrionomys glareolus) has developed radioresistance as a
   result of 14 years of chronic, low-dose radiation exposure. Naive votes
   were placed in environmental enclosures in the Red Forest region of the
   exclusion zone for 30 d. Blood samples were obtained at regular
   intervals, and the MN assay was used to assess chromosomal damage.
   Additionally, radionuclide uptake was monitored throughout the study,
   and dose was documented for each individual as well as for their
   offspring' Total dose for the votes experimentally exposed in this
   environment averaged 1.09 Gy (36.20 mGy d(-1)) for the 30-d study
   period. Our results indicate that exposure to radiation levels well
   above regulatory statutes did not result in an increased MN frequency.
   Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis that votes
   chronically exposed to these radiation levels have developed a genetic
   basis for radioresistance that is unique from that present in naive
   populations. The use of C. glareolas as a sentinel species for
   environmental studies of radiation contamination and the question of
   whether the NLN assay is an appropriate endpoint for studies of
   low-dose, chronic radiation exposure are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the life history, metal-avoidance behavior, spatial
   distribution, and population growth of enchytraeid worms (Cognettia
   sphagnetorum {[}Oligochaeta)) originating from two sites: one
   uncontaminated, and another patchily polluted by heavy metals. Effects
   of patchy soil contamination on populations were studied in microcosms.
   In uncontaminated soil, worms from the polluted site had lower viability
   and reduced growth rate as juveniles but higher growth rate as adults
   compared to worms from the unpolluted site. They were also smaller in
   size at fragmentation (reproduction). Worms from the polluted site
   reached a larger population size than worms from the unpolluted site.
   Hence, worms from the polluted site seemed to allocate more energy to
   reproduction, because such a strategy can be highly adaptive when living
   in a less-polluted patch (the source) in, on average, a highly polluted
   environment. The C. sphagnetorum actively avoided Cu-contaminated soil,
   with the response being stronger in individuals from the contaminated
   site. When an unpolluted patch (the source) was surrounded by a toxic
   environment (the sink), worms were found in the sink, either because
   intraspecific competition overrode the avoidance behavior or because of
   random walk migration. As a result, total population size in these
   microcosms were as high as those in totally uncontaminated microcosms.
   Our results indicate that avoidance behavior and increased allocation to
   reproduction, together with the observed dispersal pattern, can be an
   adaptive strategy for C. sphagnetorum in the presence of small,
   less-polluted patches in, on average, a hostile environment. Hence,
   sink-source population regulation can explain spatial distribution and
   survival of C. sphagnetorum in patchily polluted field soils. When such
   population dynamics occur, this pattern should be taken into account
   when population densities in the field are monitored for ecological
   risk-assessment procedures concerning toxicants.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been an increased use of the measurement of
   sex steroid hormone levels in the blood of animals exposed to chemicals
   as an indicator of reproductive impairment or an alteration in endocrine
   function. Although levels of hormones are often compared among animals
   and laboratories, there has been no study to examine the between-lab
   oratory variability in actual steroid measurements. Therefore, we
   initiated a study with white sucker collected from a site receiving pulp
   mill effluent, previously documented as having reduced steroid levels,
   to address this issue. Samples of plasma and media from in vitro gonadal
   incubations were delivered to eight outside laboratories with the
   ability to measure steroid hormones. These laboratories ran-ed from
   well-established fish endocrine laboratories to wildlife toxicology
   laboratories, which have recently implemented the methods to measure
   steroid hormones. In this study, we have considered both the absolute
   measure of steroid content between laboratories as well as the ability
   to discriminate between reference and exposed populations as important
   criteria when evaluating the utility of these measures. Of the eight
   outside laboratories conducting the analyses, six detected identical
   site differences in circulating levels of testosterone and 17 beta
   -estradiol to those documented by our Burlington laboratory (ON,
   Canada). However, the absolute value of the steroid hormones measured in
   the plasma varied significantly (plasma testosterone 0.6-23.1 ng/ml, 17
   beta -estradiol 77.6-1782.7 pg/ml) with coefficients of variation of
   70.4\% and 60.3\% respectively. Similar results were demonstrated for
   the measurement of steroid hormones in media following in vitro gonadal
   incubation. Although there was a fair amount of variability in the
   absolute measure of steroid hormone levels, we would predict a far
   greater coherence of interlaboratory results through the sharing of
   reagents and the use of a common methodology between laboratories. These
   results are very promising, providing evidence for the inclusion of
   steroid hormones in monitoring endocrine disruption in wildlife species.}},

Abstract = {{Size and abundance of age-0 perch and pikeperch were studied in three
   adjacent bays in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. The age-0 fish were
   sampled with a beach seine in littoral habitats from June to August in
   1982-1993. The results showed that once the studied percids were
   recruited to the seine, at about the size of 10 mm, the lengths were
   positively correlated with water temperature, measured as degree-day
   sums over a threshold of 10 degreesC. The lengths differed among the
   three bays with time, but this was due to spatial differences in water
   temperatures. In June, the correlations between abundance and water
   temperature were positive, indicating an earlier recruitment to the
   seine in warmer years. In late July, abundance correlated negatively
   with the accumulated temperature, indicating an earlier outward
   migration in warmer years. Due to this temperature-dependent abundance
   pattern there was no single time period when the age-0 abundances were
   comparable between years. Only when the accumulated temperature at the
   time of seining was taken into account annual differences in summer
   abundance could be compared, and age-0 perch and pikeperch were
   progressively smaller and less abundant the colder the summer. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Populations of the red widow spider, Latrodectus bishopi, in native
   Florida scrub at the Arch-bold Biological Station were monitored
   annually on ten similar to0.5 ha transects in late winter from 1987 to
   2000. Of 398 L. bishopi detected in the study, all but three had their
   silken retreats built in palmetto leaves. L. bishopi at rest in retreats
   in saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) were higher above the ground (similar
   to0.5 m) than spiders in scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia) (similar to0.3
   m). From a peak of 31 spiders/ha in 1989, the average L. bishopi density
   declined exponentially to only 0.3 spiders/ha in 1997, after which L.
   bishopi densities began to recover. Burning of scrubby transects in
   spring or summer appeared to have no affect on subsequent L. bishopi
   populations. There were no significant correlations between L. bishopi
   population density and local temperature or precipitation data. These
   results suggest that undescribed biotic factors may regulate populations
   of the red widow spider in a density-dependent fashion.}},

Abstract = {{We present analyses of our transect survey data from consecutive years
   at 11 sites in Wisconsin during 1990-99 for the regal fritillary
   (Speyeria idalia), which is listed under state law as endangered, and
   the closely related but more widespread and abundant Aphrodite
   fritillary (Speyeria aphrodite). Within year, the date of peak survey
   numbers at each site ranged over a period of several weeks or more for
   each fritillary. Within year and site, the Aphrodite fritillary peak was
   typically a few days to a week prior to the regal fritillary's peak.
   Both fritillaries exhibited large annual fluctuations which were
   significantly correlated between the two species. Relatively larger
   regal fritillary densities were consistently associated with active
   non-fire managements (grazing, cutting), relatively lower densities with
   burning, and widely varying densities with non-management. More
   unfavorable outcomes from burning occurred at sites where the entire
   habitat patch was fire-managed. Similar but less sensitive was the
   Aphrodite fritillary, which did not respond as strongly or clearly to
   burning, although higher densities were associated with unintensive
   non-fire managements. In Wisconsin and adjoining areas, the Aphrodite
   fritillary appears useful as a substitute in tests of techniques for
   habitat restoration or reintroduction for the regal fritillary. Since
   the Aphrodite fritillary may be less sensitive than the regal
   fritillary, success with the former certainly doesn't prove suitability
   for the latter. But unless and until the method works for the Aphrodite
   fritillary, it is almost certainly unsuitable for the regal fritillary.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing reports of amphibian limb malformations from many parts of
   North America have prompted investigations into the potential causes of
   these abnormalities and their implications for amphibian populations.
   Over a two-year period, we monitored the frequency and composition of
   morphological abnormalities in four amphibian species (Hyla regilla,
   Taricha torosa, Bufo boreas, and Rana catesbeiana) from two California
   ponds. The frequency of abnormalities differed significantly by species,
   life-history stage, pond, and season. Generally, the frequency and
   severity of abnormalities were greater in the amphibians from Frog Pond
   over those from Hidden Pond, and in lan,al stages over emerging and
   adult amphibians. Larvae of T. torosa exhibited the highest rate of
   abnormalities, ranging from 15-50\%, followed by larval and metamorphic
   H. regilla (10-25\%), and finally by metamorphic B. boreas and R.
   catesbeiana, both of which had rates of less than five percent. Within
   each species, the composition of abnormalities was strongly consistent
   between years, ponds, and early life-history stages. We recorded the
   most severe malformations in H. regilla, and more than 60\% of the
   abnormalities in treefrogs involved extra hindlimbs, femoral
   projections, and skin webbings. Similarly severe, the abnormalities of
   R. catesbeiana wore dominated by extra and missing hind- and forelimbs.
   In B. boreas and T torosa, the most common morphological abnormalities
   were missing limbs and digits, which accounted for approximately 75\%
   and 95\%, respectively., of their total abnormalities. Potential causes
   of the observed abnormalities, including infection by the trematode
   Ribeiroia, and the conservation significance of amphibian malformations
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Gonadal maturation, spawning, fecundity and timing of reproduction of
   the snail Cerithidea cingulata in a brackish water pond in Molo, Iloilo,
   Philippines, are described. Snails 4-41 mm. in shell length were sampled
   monthly from May 1997 to May 1998; 25\% were <25 mm, 67\% were 20-30 mm,
   and 8\% were >30 mm. The sexes are separate and could first be
   distinguished at 15 mm. Males are aphallic, have narrower shells than
   females of the same length, and have bright yellow-orange testes
   overlying the digestive gland deep inside the shell. Females have more
   robust shells, an ovipositor at the right side of the foot, and
   yellow-green ovaries overlying the digestive gland. The sex ratio was
   one male to two females in the pond population studied. Gonadal
   maturation was monitored by means of gonadosomatic index.(GSI, gonad
   weight as a percent of visceral weight); maturation stages were based on
   the gonad appearance (immature, developing, mature) and histology
   (immature, developing, mature, redeveloping). GSI increased with snail
   size, and reached 16\% in a 33-mm female. The smallest mature males and
   females were 18-19 mm, and most snails >20 min were mature, spawning, or
   redeveloping. Histological sections showed all stages of gametogenesis
   in mature male snails. The oocyte size-frequency distributions in mature
   females showed mostly mature oocytes and secondary oocytes, but also
   oogonia and primary oocytes. GSI and the frequency of snails at
   different maturation stages varied over the year. Both GSI and the
   frequency of mature snails were highest during the summer months, April
   to August. Nevertheless, mature snails occurred throughout the whole
   year, as did mating and egg-laying. Fecundity (= number of oocytes >70
   mum) increased with size in mature females 20-41 mm; an average 25-mm.
   female produced about 1,500 oocytes and larger females produced a
   maximum of about 2,500 oocytes. Eggs strings laid on the pond bottom
   were 45-75 mm. long; an average 64-mm. string contained 2,000 eggs
   210+20 mum in diameter. The density of eggs strings was highest
   (80-120/m(2)) during March-September. Eggs hatched after 6-7 d into
   planktonic veligers, which in tam settle on the pond bottom 11-12 d
   later as juveniles. Juveniles 2-6-mm. long were most abundant in the
   pond during August-October.}},

Abstract = {{1. This study examined the changing status of the marine ecosystem at
   the island of South Georgia (Southern Ocean) using up to 27 variables
   measured over 22 years from three upper trophic level predators that
   specialize in foraging upon krill (Eupuasia superba Dana). These
   variables included population size, breeding performance, offspring
   growth rate, foraging behaviour and diet. A method was developed for
   reducing these multivariate time-series to a single vector, called a
   combined standardized index (CSI).
   2. Sensitivity analyses showed that missing values had a large effect
   upon the accuracy of the CSI but this effect was reduced if the
   individual variables were highly correlated. The level of correlation
   and proportion of missing values within the empirical data set were
   within the acceptable range. Individual variables had widely varying
   influence upon the CSI but, in general, those with longer time-series
   had the greatest influence.
   3. Principal components analysis showed that variables representing
   offspring growth tended to explain the greatest proportion of the
   variability in the CSI and this was followed by variables representing
   diet.
   4. There were 3 years in which the CSI showed extreme and significantly
   low values. There was a significant non-linear functional response
   (similar to the Holling Type II functional response) between the overall
   CSI and krill biomass and a similar relationship existed when the CSI
   was calculated for each species individually.
   5. Separate analysis of variables that were likely to be representative
   of changing population size showed the presence of a significant decline
   between 1977 and 1998. There was no trend in the CSI from variables
   representative of foraging conditions during the summer breeding season.
   The study has shown that the marine ecosystem at South Georgia shows
   acute but transient variability that is amplified in the response of
   upper trophic-level predators. There is less certainty that trends in
   populations are a consequence of shifts in the degree to which the
   ecosystem can support krill-feeding seals and penguins.}},

Abstract = {{To learn more about mid-Pacific migration, we radio-tagged 40 Pacific
   Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis fulva) in spring 1999 on their wintering
   territories in Hawaii. The birds departed in late April. and with aerial
   monitoring we relocated 10 of them in Alaska. Seven individuals were in
   or near the Nushagak River lowlands in southwestern Alaska. Nesting
   Pacific Golden-Plovers were discovered there in 1994 disjunct from the
   previously known breeding range. The remaining three radio-tagged birds
   were found north of Bethel on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Our results
   Suggest that breeding is continuous from the Nushagak region west
   through the uplands north of Bristol Bay to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.
   Thus, plovers wintering in Hawaii apparently nest across a wide area of
   Alaska. We present a revised Alaska breeding distribution map for the
   species which differs significantly from AOU Check-list boundaries. The
   temporary attachment of transmitters (they, are shed during summer
   molting) had no apparent effect or) survival within our sample
   population. Birds that had carried transmitters returned to their winter
   territories in Hawaii at a rate nearly identical to banded plovers not
   radio-tagged.}},

Abstract = {{Checklist programs that compile birding observations are potentially
   useful for population monitoring. Previous analyses showed that trends
   in Quebec checklist data from migration seasons were significantly
   correlated With trends front the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) in Quebec,
   although agreement of trend magnitudes for individual species was low.
   Here we analyze Quebec checklist data from the breeding season for
   comparison, using both the full data set and a subset of data collected
   at frequently visited ({''}standard{''}) sites. Checklist trends from
   the breeding season For standard sites corresponded much more closely to
   magnitudes of BBS trends than checklist trends based on all sites,
   although in both cases, checklists accurately reflected direction of BBS
   trend in >80\% of species. Checklist trends from migration seasons for
   all sites and for standard sites were similar to each other. and did not

Abstract = {{The densities of Atlantic salmon fry (0+ years) and parr (1+ years and
   older) in shoreline habitats of the large River Teno watercourse and its
   tributary, the River Utsjoki generally fluctuated considerably, showing
   an increase from early summer towards late August and a subsequent
   decline towards autumn. The seasonal pattern of variation in density was
   more distinct for parr than for fry. In the period between late July and
   early September, parr density followed a sinusoidal curve, being highest
   in late August and lowest in early August and in September. Fry density
   had a weaker seasonal profile than parr, being highest in late August
   and in early September. Frequency distributions of the parr age groups
   (1 +, 2 + and greater than or equal to3 + years) were mainly independent
   of the sampling month. (C) 2001 The Fisheries Society of the British

Abstract = {{Techniques to assess population changes in reptiles across large
   landscapes are a conservation and management need. We studied a
   population of Texas tortoises (Gopherus berlandieri) on a large study
   area (6150 ha) of contiguous thornscrub vegetation in southern Texas
   from 1990 to 1999. We examined cohort and temporal variation in capture
   probabilities; and estimated survival, population size, and lambda
   (finite population growth rate) for a population of Texas tortoises. We
   captured 2128 tortoises a total of 3132 times during the study period.
   The distribution of the frequency of captures by sex varied during the
   active season and across years, but annual capture probabilities were
   similar between sexes. The ratio of juvenile to adults varied by a
   month-by-year interaction. Tortoises exhibited a temporary response to
   marking that was modeled in survival analysis. Capture probabilities of
   adult tortoises on an annual basis ranged from 0.12-0.38, and annual
   survival rate of adults was estimated to be 0.79 +/- 0.05. We estimated
   the density of the adult population to be 0.26 tortoises/ha, a level of
   magnitude lower than previous work conducted on habitat islands. Lambda
   (population growth rate) was estimated to be 0.981 (95\% confidence
   limits: 0.945-1.019) from a Jolly-Seber model. Road-cruising was an
   effective large-scale method for population monitoring of the Texas
   tortoise in our study area and may prove useful in thornscrub habitats
   that compose the majority of its geographic range.}},

Abstract = {{Before, during and after habitat restoration from 1984 to 1994, we
   monitored population size of the federally listed endangered El Segundo
   blue butterfly, Euphilotes bernardino allyni (Shields). In the
   subsequent formalization of a recovery plan for the species, the U. S.
   Fish and Wildlife Service established several recovery criteria,
   including a requirement of `a scientifically credible monitoring plan'
   to track population size annually. To avoid detrimental effects of the
   extensively used mark-release-recapture method on the delicate El
   Segundo blue butterfly, which would conflict with protection afforded by
   the Endangered Species Act, we chose instead to perform transect counts
   to estimate relative population size. Herein, we analyze the results of
   our transect counts by three different methods, developed by or modified
   from Pollard, Watt et al. and Zonneveld. Qualitatively, the three
   methods, which have different assumptions, produced similar results when
   applied to the same data. Zonneveld's model estimates death rate in
   addition to an index of population size, thus providing more information
   than the other two methods. The El Segundo blue butterfly's sedentary
   nature and the close relationship of its adult and early stages to one
   foodplant permits extrapolation of the index of population size based on
   transect counts, to an estimate of actual population size. Our data
   document butterfly numbers increasing from 1984 to 1989, but then
   declining until the end of our observations in 1994. Based on analysis
   of our El Segundo blue butterfly data, we propose an implementation of a
   scientifically credible monitoring plan.}},

   interaction between recessive mutants and evolution in southern France}},

Abstract = {{In southern France, failure to control Culex pipiens L. with Bacillus
   sphaericus Neide toxin (Bs) was first detected in 1994, at the extreme
   east of the Languedoc-Roussillon coast. This failure was due to a single
   recessive mutant, sp-1(R). Two complementary strategies were used to
   test whether sp-1(R) had invaded the Bs-controlled area by 1998. First,
   a strain (BP) was selected from resistant larvae sampled in the western
   part of the Bs-controlled area. In BP strain, resistance involved a
   single recessive gene, sp-2(R), distinct from sp-1(R), that conferred a
   similarly high resistance in the homozygous state (approximate
   to6,000-fold). Combining one copy of sp-1(R) and one of sp-2(R)
   conferred a > 100-fold resistance. Second, Bs-resistance was monitored
   among the offspring of field females crossed to sp-1(RR) homozygous
   males. Females were sampled in 20 localities of southern France and
   three localities of the Llobregat delta (Barcelona, Spain) where C.
   pipiens control is also intensive. The 537 females in the study produced
   enough larvae to infer their genotype: 462 progenies were susceptible
   and the survival rate of 51 others was explained by the presence of
   sp-1(R) and/or sp-2(R). The remaining 24 cases indicated that other
   factors could confer resistance when combined with sp-1(R). The current
   data showed that, even when recessive, resistant mutants can rapidly
   increase in frequency, providing some interactions that protect them
   from disappearance. We discuss the consequences of this finding on the
   current strategies aimed to avoid or delay resistance in the pests
   controlled with B. sphaericus or B. thuringiensis Berliner toxins.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate matter (PM) exposure data from the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA)-sponsored 1998 Baltimore and 1999 Fresno PM
   exposure studies were analyzed to identify important microenvironments
   and activities that may lead to increased particle exposure for select
   elderly (> 65 years old) subjects. Integrated 24-hr filter-based PM2.5
   or PM10 mass measurements {[}using Personal Environmental
   Monitors(PEMs)] included personal measurements, indoor and outdoor
   residential measurements, and measurements at a central indoor site and
   a community monitoring site. A subset of the participants in each study
   wore passive nephelometers that continuously measured (1-min averaging
   time) particles ranging in size from 0.1 to similar to 10 mum.
   Significant activities and locations were identified by a statistical
   mixed model (p < 0.01) for each study population based on the measured
   PM2.5 or PM10 mass and time activity data. Elevated PM concentrations
   were associated with traveling (car or bus), commercial locations
   (store, office, mall, etc.), restaurants, and working. The modeled
   results were compared to continuous PM concentrations determined by the
   nephelometers while participants were in these locations. Overall, the
   nephelometer data agreed within 6\% of the modeled PM2.5 results for the
   Baltimore participants and within similar to 20\% for the Fresno
   participants (variability was due to zero drift associated with the
   nephelometer). The nephelometer did not agree as well with the PM10 mass
   measurements, most likely because the nephelometer optimally responds to
   fine particles (0.3-2 mum). Approximately one-half (54 +/- 31\%; mean
   standard deviation from both studies) of the average daily PM2.5
   exposure occurred inside residences, where the participants spent an
   average of 83 +/- 10\% of their time. These data also showed that a
   significant portion of PM2.5 exposure occurred in locations where
   participants spent only 4-13\% of their time.}},

Abstract = {{Size and age compositions of yellowtail scad (Trachurus novaezelandiae
   Richardson 1843) and blue mackerel (Scomber australasicus Cuvier 1832)
   were studied in the inshore purse-seine fishery off the coast of New
   South Wales, Australia. Ages were assigned by counting annual marks in
   otoliths for both species. Sampling from two regions showed no
   geographical differences in the age compositions of catches for either
   species. The fishery for yellowtail scad was based on 2- and 3-year-old
   fish, but with significant numbers of fish up to 11 years. Seventy
   percent of the fishery for blue mackerel was based on fish aged 1 year,
   with the majority of the rest being in their first or third years.
   Maximum ages recorded in this study were 14 years for yellowtail. scad
   and 7 years for blue mackerel. We found no major differences in the
   sizes of blue mackerel landed in either region sampled, but yellowtail.
   scad were larger in the northern region than in the southern. Growth
   rates of blue mackerel were the same from both regions, but yellowtail
   scad sampled grew significantly faster in the northern region. The
   fishery for yellowtail scad off New South Wales is currently based on
   younger and smaller fish than other trachurid fisheries around the
   world. This, together with the observed spatial variation in growth and
   population structure, suggests that the fishery for yellowtail scad in
   New South Wales should be carefully monitored.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the response of cavity-nesting species to three snag
   density treatments (high = 37-80 snags/ha, medium = 15-35 snags/ha, and
   low = 0-12 snags/ha) during two breeding seasons 4-5 yr post-fire and
   logging in Douglas-fir-ponderosa pine. forests in the eastern Cascades,
   Washington. Snag surveys were used to describe habitat, and both
   breeding bird surveys and nest surveys were used to characterize the
   bird community. Stands with the medium snag density treatment had the
   highest abundance, species richness, and nesting population of cavity
   nesters. The reasons for this may be: 1) snags were not evenly
   distributed within a stand such that both clumped and dispersed snag
   density habitats were interspersed in this treatment, and 2) a greater
   proportion of ponderosa pine snags in medium density treatments may have
   attracted species that prefer ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging.
   Ponderosa pine was preferred for nest sites and large snags (> 48 cm
   dbh) provided nesting habitat for more species than smaller snags.
   However, smaller snags were used for nesting and foraging by some
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Whitebark pine abundance is declining in western North America due to
   white pine blister rust, fire exclusion, and mountain pine beetle. In
   this study, natural color aerial photograph (23 x 23 cm) negatives,
   scales between 1:2,000 and 1:6,000) were used to estimate whitebark pine
   abundance in Mount Rainier National Park. Ground truth field plots were
   similar to counts from aerial photographs (80.2\% accuracy). Correlation
   analysis between subpopulation area and abundance was used to supplement
   incomplete aerial coverage and determine the final whitebark pine
   abundance in the Park. Whitebark pine density, and vegetation cover
   type, influenced counts from the aerial photographs. Highly clustered
   whitebark pine sites demonstrated 7\% greater accuracy when compared to
   sites that exhibited little clustering. Count accuracy was 4-5\% more
   accurate on whitebark pine dominant habitats compared to subalpine fir
   dominant and subalpine parkland habitat. The total number of living
   adult whitebark pine within park boundaries was similar to 22,000, with
   3,160 adult trees found in the Sunrise region. Aerial photography holds
   promise as a way to inventory and monitor whitebark pine.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of a remnant population of M. xanthomelas, located
   at Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC) began in May 1997 and continued to
   Febr. 2000 for the mitigation ponds and June 2000 for the TAMC stream.
   This sp. has been reduced to little more than 100 m of stream habitat on
   Oahu at the TAMC. Threats to M. xanthomelas include alien fish spp.,
   stream dewatering, and habitat alteration. The TAMC stream now requires
   augmented water flow because construction of a facility up gradient of
   the TAMC stream disrupted the normal hydrology of the small stream. The
   Oahu race of M. xanthomelas will soon become extinct if the stream were
   allowed to become dry, as nearly happened in June 1997. The most
   cost-effective way to ensure the survival of this sp. on Oahu would be
   to continue some mitigation water flows to the TAMC stream. The next
   step would be the establishment of another wild population to a stream
   lacking alien fish spp. It is highly recommended that a cooperative
   association of biologists from the Bishop Museum, University of Hawaii,
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Army environmental staff
   continue to monitor the population of M. xanthomelas, arguably the
   rarest insect population in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{The pattern of the number of spp. per pond changed completely between
   1988 and 2000. The growth of scrub on the edges of the ponds caused a
   decline in the number of dragonfly spp. when more than 50\% of pond edge
   was shaded by bushes. When the ponds were completely shaded they lost
   all their dragonfly spp. The decline in spp. appeared to be caused by
   shading rather than changes in the aquatic flora caused by shading. When
   the scrub was not controlled the ponds were inhabited by dragonflies
   from 26 to at least 39 yr. In ponds where no scrub developed, or where
   it was controlled. Coenagrion puella, Ischnura elegans, Aeshna cyanea,
   Libellula quadrimaculata, Sympetrum striolatum and Sympetrum sanguineum
   were still continuing to inhabit the ponds after 39 yr. Aeshna grandis,
   which had occurred most yr. in the 1962-1988 period, was still present
   in 2000. Pyrrhosoma nymphula and Brachytron pratense, which had bred
   from 1964 to 1972 and 1968 to 1973 respectively. both reappeared after
   20 yr absence. Their return to the ponds appeared to be connected with
   their increase in adjacent habitats at Woodwalton Fen in the 1989-2000
   period. Anax imperator and Libellula fulva, which had also increased at
   Woodwalton Fen, were seen for the first time at the ponds during this
   period. The mason for the recent disappearance of Lestes sponsa from the
   ponds and adjacent habitats is not known. This study yet further
   emphasises the need to conserve large core populations of dragonflies,
   and it reiterates the need for really long term monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{During the development of a resistance-monitoring bioassay that uses
   males as the life-stage tested, the relationship of adult female and
   male susceptibility of Grapholita molesta to different classes of
   insecticides was investigated. Preliminary results indicated that more
   males survived diagnostic doses of azinphos-methyl than females.
   Additional research revealed that, although the body mass of adult male
   G molesta was only 69\% of that of female moths (5.67 and 8.20 mg,
   respectively), their LC50 values were 2.6, 4.1 and 10.3 times higher
   than those of females for azinphosmethyl, malathion and
   parathion-methyl, respectively. However, female G molesta moths were
   more tolerant to methomyl than were male moths. There was no indication
   that this sex-related response occurred in G molesta larvae. The results
   presented here raise concerns regarding the use of pheromone traps for
   determining whether insecticide treatments are required and as part of
   resistance monitoring programs. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{In vivo toxicity assays have shown that organophosphate insecticides are
   less toxic to male than to female Oriental fruit moths Grapholita
   molesta. While male moths have higher levels of acetylcholinesterase and
   general esterase activities, female moth acetylcholinesterase enzymes
   are less sensitive to aromatic and aliphatic organophosphates than male
   enzymes. Elevated esterase and acetylcholinesterase activities in male
   moths explain their greater tolerance to aromatic and aliphatic
   organophosphates. Male and female acetylcholinesterase enzymes are
   equally tolerant to heteroaromatic organophosphates, the most widely
   used of this class of insecticides in G molesta control. This
   observation, in contrast to the greater sensitivity of male
   acetylcholinesterases to aromatic and aliphatic organophosphates, shows
   the potential for the evolution of insensitive target sites in male
   moths, which would increase male G molesta tolerance to these
   insecticides. Significant sex-linked differences in insecticide
   tolerance have not been reported previously in lepidopterans. The
   practical implications of the observed differences in tolerance in male
   and female G molesta question the practice of using pheromone traps to
   monitor populations of these moths in orchards. (C) 2001 Society of

Abstract = {{Overwintering of tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca, was investigated
   on common winter annual host plants infected with Tomato spotted wilt
   virus (TSWV). Populations of tobacco thrips produced on TSWV-infected
   plants did not differ from those produced on healthy plants, whereas
   populations varied greatly among host plant species. The mean per plant
   populations of F fusca averaged 401, 162, and 10 thrips per plant on
   Stellaria media, Scleranthus annuus, and Sonchus asper, respectively,
   during peak abundance in May. Adult F fusca collected from plant hosts
   were predominately brachypterous throughout the winter and early spring,
   but macropterous forms predominated in late spring. Weed hosts varied in
   their ability to serve as overwintering sources of TSWV inoculum.
   Following the initial infection by TSWV in October 1997, 75\% of
   Scleranthus annuus and Stellaria media retained infection over the
   winter and spring season, whereas only 17\% of Sonchus asper plants
   remained infected throughout the same interval. Mortality of
   TSWV-infected Sonchus asper plants exceeded 25\%, but mortality of
   infected Stellaria media and Scleranthus annuus did not exceed 8\%. TSWV
   transmission by thrips produced on infected plants was greatest on
   Stellaria media (18\%), intermediate on Scleranthus annuus (6\%), and
   lowest on Sonchus asper (2\%). Very few viruliferous F fusca were
   recovered from soil samples collected below infected wild host plants.
   Vegetative growth stages of Stellaria media, Sonchus asper, and
   Ranunculus sardous were more susceptible to F fusca transmission of TSWV
   than flowering growth stages, whereas both growth stages of Scleranthus
   annaus were equally susceptible. In a field study to monitor the spatial
   and temporal patterns of virus movement from a central source of
   TSWV-infected Stellaria media to adjacent plots of R. sardous, the
   incidence of infection in R. sardous plots increased from <1\% in March
   to > 42\% in June 1999. Infection levels in the Stellaria media inoculum
   source remained high throughout the experiment, averaging nearly 80\%
   until June 1999 when all Stellaria media plants had senesced. Dispersal
   of TSWV from the inoculum. source extended to the limits of the
   experimental plot (> 37 in). Significant directional patterns of TSVW
   spread to the R. sardous plots were detected in April and May but not in
   June. R. sardous infections were detected as early as March and April,
   suggesting that overwintering inoculum levels in an area can increase
   rapidly during the spring in susceptible weed hosts prior to planting of
   susceptible crops. This increase in the abundance of TSWV inoculum
   sources occurs at a time when vector populations are increasing rapidly.
   The spread of TSWV among weeds in the spring serves to bridge the period
   when overwintered inoculum sources decline and susceptible crops are
   planted.}},

Abstract = {{Humans fragment landscapes to the detriment of wildlife. We review why
   fragmentation is detrimental to wildlife (especially birds), review the
   effects of urbanization on birds inhabiting nearby native habitats,
   suggest how restoration ecologists can minimize these effects, and
   discuss future research needs. We emphasize the importance of individual
   fitness to determining community composition. This means that
   reproduction, survivorship, and dispersal (not simply community
   composition) must be maintained, restored, and monitored. We suggest
   that the severity of the effects of fragmentation are determined by (1)
   the natural disturbance regime, (2) the similarity of the anthropogenic
   matrix to the natural matrix, and (3) the persistence of the
   anthropogenic change. As a result, urbanization is likely to produce
   greater effects of fragmentation than either agriculture or timber
   harvest. Restoration ecologists, land managers, and urban planners can
   help maintain native birds in fragmented landscapes by a combination of
   short- and long-term actions designed to restore ecological function
   (not just shape and structure) to fragments, including: (1) maintaining
   native vegetation, deadwood, and other nesting structures in the
   fragment, (2) managing the landscape surrounding the fragment (matrix),
   not just the fragment, (3) making the matrix more like the native
   habitat fragments, (4) increasing the foliage height diversity within
   fragments, (5) designing buffers that reduce penetration of undesirable
   agents from the matrix, (6) recognizing that human activity is not
   compatible with interior conditions, (7) actively managing mammal
   populations in fragments, (8) discouraging open lawn on public and
   private property, (9) providing statutory recognition of the value of
   complexes of small wetlands, (10) integrating urban parks into the
   native habitat system, (11) anticipating urbanization and seeking
   creative ways to increase native habitat and manage it collectively,
   (12) reducing the growing effects of urbanization on once remote natural
   areas, (13) realizing that fragments may be best suited to conserve only
   a few species, (14) developing monitoring programs that measure fitness,
   and (15) developing a new educational paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration projects are often developed with little consideration for
   understanding their effects on wildlife. We contend, however, that
   monitoring treatment effects on wildlife should be an integral component
   of the design and execution of any management activity, including
   restoration. Thus, we provide a conceptual framework for the design and
   implementation of monitoring studies to understand the effects of
   restoration on wildlife. Our underlying premise is that effective
   monitoring hinges on an appropriate study design for unbiased and
   precise estimates of the response variables. We advocate using measures
   of population dynamics for response variables given that they provide
   the most direct measures of wildlife status and trends. The species to
   be monitored should be those constituting an assemblage of umbrella
   species that represent the range of spatial and functional requirements
   of wildlife in a restored ecological system. Selection of umbrella
   species should be based on strong empirical evidence that justifies
   their usage. We also advocate that monitoring be designed as true
   experiments or quasi-experiments rather than as observational studies to
   allow for stronger inferences regarding the effects of restoration on
   wildlife. Our primary message is that if monitoring is to be done, it
   must be scientifically based.}},

   Hyper Med 2001; 28(3)149-155 The principal aim of the present study was
   to monitor the core temperature (T-c) of a population of saturation
   divers conducting routine deep dives at different locations in the
   United Kingdom sector of the North Sea and to assess whether current
   dive procedures are adequate in preventing deleterious decreases in T-c.
   A total of 30 divers, with an average (SD) of 19.3 (6.6) yr of
   experience as saturation divers, participated in the study. The survey
   included 59 dives conducted at six locations (Scott Field, Norfra
   Pipeline, Hudson Field, Pierce Field, Forties Field, and Bruce Field)
   from four Diver Support Vessels (Rockwater 1, Semi 2, Bar Protector, and
   Discovery). The depth of the dives monitored ranged from 54 to 160
   meters of seawater (msw), and the duration of the dives from 31 min to 7
   h 30 min. before each dive, divers were requested to ingest a radio pill
   and strap a data logger to their abdomen. Upon returning to the chamber
   within the Diver Support Vessel following a dive, they provided
   subjective ratings of thermal perception (7 point scale) and thermal
   comfort (4 point scale) for the period just before, during, and
   immediately after the dive. In 55 dives, T. of saturation divers working
   at depths to 160 msw for up to 6 h with water temperatures ranging from
   4degrees to 6degreesC increased above the pre-dive core temperature of
   37.4degrees (0.62degrees +/- 0.6degreesC). In four dives there was a
   decrease in T-c: 2 divers had a 0.2degreesC fall in T-c, and 2 bellmen
   had a decrease of 0.4degrees and 1.0degreesC. The subjective responses
   of divers indicated that they were thermally neutral (neither warm nor
   cold) and comfortable before and immediately after the dives. The
   current practice of providing thermal protection with hot water suits to
   saturation divers working in the North Sea is adequate for preventing
   the risk of hypothermia and maintaining thermal comfort.}},

Abstract = {{Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of solar radiation
   for reducing survival of mountain pine beetle populations in infested
   logs. Ponderosa pine logs were used in experiments 1 and 2 and lodgepole
   pine logs were used in experiment 3. Experiment 1 comprised three
   treatments: (1) one-layer solar treatment without plastic sheeting and
   logs rotated one-third of a turn once a week; (2) two-layer solar
   treatment with plastic sheeting; and (3) two-layer solar treatment
   without plastic sheeting. For experiment 2, two additional one-layer
   treatments were added: one-layer treatment with plastic sheeting and no
   rotation and a one-layer with no plastic sheeting and no rotation.
   Experiment 3 included all the above-mentioned one-layer treatments only.
   For all experiments, brood density per 0.05 m(2) (0.5 ft(2)) was
   estimated before and after treatment and analyzed using repeated
   measures analysis of variance, Subcortical temperatures were monitored
   in one replicate of all treatments in all experiments. In experiment 2,
   phloem moisture was monitored before and after treatment in uninfested
   logs. All treatments in all experiments caused drastic reductions in
   brood survival. In experiment 1, the one-layer treatment with the logs
   rotated once a week significantly reduced brood survival compared to the
   two-layer without plastic sheeting treatment but was not different from
   the two-layer with plastic sheeting treatment. There were no differences
   in brood survival after treatment associated with any treatments in
   experiments 2 and 3. In all experiments brood survival was consistently
   reduced in the aspects of the logs exposed to the sun. Maximum
   temperatures were consistently higher in the treatments with plastic
   sheeting, the exposed surfaces of the logs to the sun, and the upper
   layer of logs in the two-layer treatments. No differences were detected
   in phloem moisture content in uninfested logs before and after treatment
   in experiment 2, suggesting that heat is directly responsible for the
   observed reductions in survival. We conclude that solar treatments are
   an effective alternative for reducing mountain pine beetle survival in
   infested ponderosa and lodgepole pine logs.}},

Abstract = {{Alkaline coal fly ash and lime were tested for their effectiveness in
   pathogen removal from biosolids at different time intervals and
   temperatures. Coal fly ash at 10 and 35\% w/w was mixed with dewatered
   biosolids and then the ash-biosolids mixture was mixed separately with
   0, 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.5, 11, and 18\% calcium oxide (w/w on a dry weight
   basis) with and without heating to 55 degreesC. Total bacteria,
   salmonella, and total coliforms were monitored at various time
   intervals. Both ash-biosolids mixtures with or without lime amendment
   had a significantly lower total bacterial population than the biosolids
   control, but the residual indigenous bacterial flora in the ash and lime
   stabilized biosolids still maintained a population of greater than 10(4)
   g(-1) dry biosolids. Alkaline-stabilized biosolids with a lime amendment
   rate greater than 8.5\% could maintain pH greater than or equal to 12
   for more than 2 hours, which effectively removed total coliforms and
   salmonella in the mixture. Heat treatment to 55 degreesC and a storage
   time of 14 days provided an added advantage resulting in a further
   reduction in pathogens for all treatments. It is recommended that 10\%
   ash-biosolids mixture should be amended with a minimum of 8.5\% lime on
   a dry weight basis for at least 2 hours to achieve acceptable levels of
   salmonella and total coliforms to ensure no pathogenic risk following

Abstract = {{Although the main theoretical framework determining how to exploit
   populations was derived almost 50 years ago, overexploitation is common.
   I review 10 major concepts underlying the regulation of exploitation:
   population increase can be exploited; density dependence is essential;
   quantifying density dependence is exceedingly difficult; sustainable
   exploitation involves reducing population size; population growth rate
   is usually mismeasured; sustainability has many conflicting definitions
   and the choice depends upon the objectives; it is better to monitor the
   population than the harvest; quotas are unstable; increasing effort is
   simple, reducing it is painful; exploit conservatively. I then give a
   brief account of each of the nine main methods that are used to
   determine sustainable exploitation and the uses, advantages and
   limitations of each. The nine techniques are: surplus production models,
   yield per recruit models, Robinson and Redford model, linking yield to
   recruitment and mortality, adjusting to population changes, comparing
   demography across sites, reducing to a fixed fraction of unexploited
   population size, full population models and adaptive management.}},

Abstract = {{An array of models for sustainable harvesting has been proposed, and
   most are in some way dependent on a density-dependent response. I tested
   a subset of these models by manipulating three North American deer
   populations to reveal density dependence and determine population
   response to harvests. These were a white-tailed deer Odocoileus
   virginianus population on the George Reserve (GR) in southeastern
   Michigan, and black-tailed deer O. hemionus columbianus populations on
   Hopland Research and Extension Center (HREC) in Mendocino County,
   California, and on Fort Hunter Liggett (FHL) in Monterey County,
   California. The study areas represented a gradation in size,
   productivity, management control, and environmental stochasticity. The
   GR population showed a nearly linear density-dependent relationship of r
   on N. A mean maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 49 deer/year was
   obtained at an N of 56\% of K carrying capacity (KCC). A fixed harvest
   with stochasticity, however, reduced the sustainable MSY to 43
   deer/year. A second population growth experiment 50 years after the
   initial introduction showed an equivalent growth rate. Analysis of
   harvest data from FHL showed buck harvest to be positively related to
   size of previous female harvests. From these results, a `linked-sex
   harvest strategy' (LSHS) was proposed in which female harvest is
   sequentially incremented so long as buck harvest continues to increase,
   up to a presumed `safe' female to buck ratio. At HREC, bucks were
   harvested in public bucks-only seasons. Buck harvest was monitored for
   6-year pre- and post-treatment periods without female removals, and for
   a 7-year treatment period during which 20 females/year were removed for
   three years and 30 females/year for four years. There was no significant
   difference in pre- and post-treatment period buck harvests, so they were
   combined as a `control'. There was a significant (25\%) increase in buck
   harvest during the treatment period despite its coinciding with six
   consecutive years of drought. The combined-sex harvest was more than
   double that of the buck harvest alone during the control periods. The
   relevance of these studies to deer harvest management is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Waterfowl management in the United States is one of the more visible
   conservation success stories in the United States. It is authorized and
   supported by appropriate legislative authorities, based on large-scale
   monitoring programs, and widely accepted by the public. The process is
   one of only a limited number of large-scale examples of effective
   collaboration between research and management, integrating scientific
   information with management in a coherent framework for regulatory
   decision-making. However, harvest management continues to face some
   serious technical problems, many of which focus on sequential
   identification of the resource system in a context of optimal
   decision-making. The objective of this paper is to provide a theoretical
   foundation of adaptive harvest management, the approach currently in use
   in the United States for regulatory decision-making. We lay out the
   legal and institutional framework for adaptive harvest management and
   provide a formal description of regulatory decision-making in terms of
   adaptive optimization. We discuss some technical and institutional
   challenges in applying adaptive harvest management and focus
   specifically on methods of estimating resource states for linear
   resource systems.}},

Abstract = {{Spotlight and scent-station surveys have been used to monitor
   populations of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis
   mutica), but reliability of these methods has been tested rarely. We
   evaluated effectiveness of these techniques to monitor long-term (8- to
   13-yr) trends in a population of kit foxes over a 216-km(2) area. Counts
   of foxes during fall and winter spotlight surveys were correlated
   positively with population estimates of kit foxes (r greater than or
   equal to0.59, P less than or equal to0.06). Fall scent-station indices
   and population estimates were correlated positively (r=0.65, P=0.08).
   However, spotlight and scent-station indices were imprecise and detected
   only large changes in population size. Further studies are needed to
   determine whether replicating surveys within seasons or increasing
   sampling intensity can provide more reliable indices of kit fox
   abundance.}},

Abstract = {{A primary concern for waterfowl managers is continued loss and
   modification of natural habitats and resulting effects on waterfowl
   populations. Thus it is increasingly important to understand use of
   manipulated environments. We studied the use by breeding dabbling ducks
   of cultivated wild rice (Zizania palustris) paddies and associated
   uplands in northwestern Minnesota during 1993-95. During 3 field
   seasons, we recorded an average of 1,196 (SE=285.9) breeding pairs (0.80
   pairs/ha of wild rice paddy) on the study area. Mallards Anas
   platyrhynchos), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), and northern shovelers
   (Anas clypeata) comprised > 95\% of the breeding population. We
   monitored 336 nests, and Mayfield's estimate of nesting success was
   19.9\% (95\% Cl=15.9-25.0\%), with an average clutch size of 10.0 eggs
   (SE=0.13). We used nest success as a conservative estimate of hen
   success because we could not generate a reliable estimate of renesting
   rate from our data. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for 70 radio-marked
   mallard ducklings from 19 broods was 42\% (95\% Cl=25-58\%). A
   production estimate from our 3,444-ha study area was 999 fledged
   ducklings/year (0.29/ha) and about 0.67 duckling/ha of wild rice paddy.
   Because wild rice production areas can attract and concentrate large
   numbers of breeding waterfowl, techniques that increase nest success and
   duckling survival (e.g., preserving large blocks of nesting cover,
   deploying secure nesting structures, and predator control) should be
   considered to maximize local production.}},

Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) have declined greatly in abundance during
   the past century, and this warrants efforts to restore populations.
   Restoration often requires translocating animals to previously occupied
   areas. Workers should follow standard protocols for animal handling and
   care. Translocation involves selecting source populations and release
   sites, capturing and transporting animals, preparing release sites with
   attendant soft-release infrastructure, and monitoring and managing
   animals. Source populations should be free of plague and genetically
   appropriate for the translocation strategy. Release sites ideally have
   physical or historical evidence of previous occupancy, but also may be
   selected based on soils, slope, and vegetation. Capture, transport, and
   release of animals must comply with federal, state, and local
   regulations. Animals have been commonly captured with live traps, by
   flooding their burrows, or by using a specially adapted vacuum truck;
   those captured in plague-prone areas are treated to control fleas.
   Captives usually are hauled to release sites in covered pickup truck
   beds or trailers. High-quality release sites have short vegetation (< 12
   cm tall) and pre-existing burrows; sites without these qualities may
   need modification. Retention baskets or fenced enclosures, sometimes
   combined with artificial underground nest chambers, have been used to
   reduce dispersal and predation. Control of predators may be needed prior
   to or following release. Post-release monitoring to detect and remedy
   potential problems such as dispersal and predation is recommended, and
   providing a food subsidy may reduce dispersal and elevate survival.}},

Abstract = {{Although previous research has provided information on the temporal and
   spatial occurrence of scraping by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus), inferences regarding the communicative significance of
   these behaviors have been hampered by the inability to observe specific
   behavioral patterns at scrape sites. By using motion-activated video
   cameras, we continuously monitored scraping behaviors at 6 sites over 2
   consecutive breeding seasons in a free-ranging population in the Georgia
   Piedmont. Most visits by males (85\%) and females (75\%) occurred after
   dark. Females made more visits to scrapes than males (P <0.001), but
   males interacted with scrapes more frequently (P=0.049). Marking
   behaviors by males were most frequent during October. Yearling males
   performed 42\% and males greater than or equal to2.5 years old performed
   58\% of marking behaviors. As many as 13 males visited individual
   scrapes and some scrape sites were marked by 9 different males. Males
   frequently investigated scrapes without scent marking, and about 50\% of
   males revisited scrapes. Most previous studies of white-tailed deer
   scraping behaviors focused on captive deer. Our study is the first
   detailed investigation of scraping in a wild population, and it presents
   contrasting and previously unreported behaviors. Some prior conclusions
   drawn from behavioral studies of captive deer may not be applicable to
   wild populations.}},

   mowed wider than the track to facilitate drying), and nested in sites
   with high herbaceous density compared to unoccupied regeneration areas.
   Nest sites had fewer saplings and less canopy cover than the surrounding

Abstract = {{Marine viruses have been shown to affect phytoplankton productivity;
   however, there are no reports on the effect of viruses on benthic
   microalgae (microphytobenthos). Hence, this study investigated the
   effects of elevated concentrations of virus-like particles on the
   photosynthetic physiology and community composition of benthic
   microalgae and phytoplankton. Virus populations were collected near the
   sediment surface and concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration,
   and the concentrate was added to benthic and water column samples that
   were obtained along a eutrophication gradient in the Brisbane
   River/Moreton Bay estuary, Australia. Photosynthetic and community
   responses of benthic microalgae, phytoplankton and bacteria were
   monitored over 7 d in aquaria and in situ. Benthic microalgal
   communities responded to viral enrichment in both eutrophic and
   oligotrophic sediments. In eutrophic sediments, Euglenophytes (Euglena
   sp.) and bacteria decreased in abundance by 20 to 60 and 26 to 66\%,
   respectively, from seawater controls. In oligotrophic sediments,
   bacteria decreased in abundance by 30 to 42\% from seawater controls but
   the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium sp. increased in abundance by 270 to
   3600\% from seawater controls, The increased abundance of Gymnodinium
   sp. may be related to increased availability of dissolved organic matter
   released from lysed bacteria. Increased (140 to 190\% from seawater
   controls) initial chlorophyll a fluorescence measured with a
   pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometer was observed in eutrophic benthic
   microalgal incubations following virus enrichment, consistent with
   photosystem II damage. Virus enrichment in oligotrophic water
   significantly stimulated carbon fixation rates, perhaps due to increased
   nutrient availability by bacterial lysis. The interpretation of data
   from virus amendment experiments is difficult due to potential
   interaction with unidentified bioactive compounds within seawater
   concentrates. However, these results show that viruses are capable of
   influencing microbial dynamics in sediments.}},

Abstract = {{The gastropod Lithopoma americanum is a common, albeit little-studied,
   inhabitant of benthic communities from Florida to the West Indies. A
   survey of L. americanum populations was conducted throughout Biscayne
   Bay, Florida, USA. Abundance of the species was highest in the
   northeastern portion of the Bay and decreased to zero in the
   southeastern portion. This pattern may be the result of hydrodynamic and
   salinity regimes that could prevent the recruitment and survival of
   larvae in the inner portions of the Bay. Abundance of a population of L.
   americanum at a permanent site within the Bay was monitored for a
   three-year period, during which gastropod density declined from 26
   gastropods m(-2) to zero. The reasons for this population crash are not
   clear, but may have been caused by high rates of predation and/or
   intraspecific competition coupled with a lack of recruitment. Growth
   rates of L. americanum were higher under laboratory conditions (0.46
   mm.week(-1)) than in the field (0.25 mm.week(-1)), suggesting that field
   populations may be food-limited. Growth rate of individuals was also
   negatively correlated vith size.}},

Abstract = {{1 The pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea, has been a serious pest of
   lodgepole pine plantations in Scotland since 1976. It historically feeds
   on native Scots pine throughout Europe but population levels of P.
   flammea on this host have never been high enough to cause tree mortality
   in the U.K.
   2 This paper reviews recent advances in the biology of the pest and
   documents control programmes from 1976 to 1999.
   3 There has been practically uninterrupted population monitoring of P.
   flammea from 1977 to the present day in Scottish lodgepole pine
   plantations. Intervention with chemical spraying has often been
   necessary.
   4 The population data suggest that populations of P. flammea may have
   had a cyclic pattern over the monitoring period, with outbreaks
   occurring at regular intervals of between 6 and 7 years.
   5 The amplitude of population cycles was large during the 1970s and
   1980s, but has dampened in recent years. Natural enemies are believed to
   contribute to this trend. Fungal disease, specifically, appears to have
   had a greater effect on pest populations in recent years than in the
   past and is suggested to have contributed significantly to the
   population dynamics observed since 1990.}},

Abstract = {{1 The recent increase in planting of selected willow clones as energy
   crops for biomass production has resulted in a need to understand the
   relationship between commonly grown, clonally propagated genotypes and
   their pests.
   2 For the first time, we present a study of the interactions of six
   willow clones and a previously unconsidered pest, the giant willow aphid
   Tuberolachnus salignus.
   3 Tuberolachnus salignus alatae displayed no preference between the
   clones, but there was genetic variation in resistance between the
   clones; Q83 was the most resistant and led to the lowest reproductive
   performance in the aphid
   4 Maternal effects buffered changes in aphid performance. On four tested
   willow clones fecundity of first generation aphids on the new host clone
   was intermediate to that of the second generation and that of the clone
   used to maintain the aphids in culture.
   5 In the field, patterns of aphid infestation were highly variable
   between years, with the duration of attack being up to four times longer
   in 1999. In both years there was a significant effect of willow clone on
   the intensity of infestation. However, whereas Orm had the lowest
   intensity of infestation in the first year, Dasyclados supported a lower
   population level than other monitored clones in the second year.}},

Abstract = {{1 In response to herbivore attack, maize plants (Zea mays L.) emit a
   specific blend of induced volatiles. Artificial damage and subsequent
   treatment of the damaged site with caterpillar regurgitant induces the
   same response. The induced volatile chemicals are known to be highly
   attractive to several parasitoids of herbivores in laboratory bioassays,
   but very limited information is available on how the plant odours affect
   entomophagous insects in the field.
   2 Experiments were conducted to determine if induced maize volatiles
   attract parasitic and predatory insects under field conditions and
   whether they affect their spatial distribution.
   3 In a preliminary field experiment with blue sticky traps near treated
   (damaged and treated with caterpillar regurgitant) and healthy plants,
   more entomophagous insects (total number of parasitic Hymenoptera,
   Anthocoridae and Syrphidae) were trapped near treated plants than near
   healthy plants.
   4 In a second experiment, attraction to the induced volatiles was
   monitored with sticky traps placed next to treated and healthy maize
   plants in a regular maize field. No significant differences between the
   two treatments were found, but significantly more insects (parasitic
   wasps, thrips and anthocorid bugs) were trapped near to the top of
   plants than on traps placed near the mid-stem. Displacement of these
   insect groups within the field seemed to occur principally over the
   canopy, but under severe weather conditions they travelled lower in the
   canopy.
   5 In a third experiment, the effect of induced maize odours on the
   spatial distribution of predators and parasitoids was investigated by
   placing sticky traps at different distances from healthy and treated
   plants. The higher catches of parasitoids near treated plants and the
   increased presence of these insects on the downwind side of treated
   plants support the notion that herbivore-induced maize odours attract
   natural enemies of maize pests in the field.}},

Abstract = {{The first step towards the preservation of endangered species is to
   establish an appropriate ranking system, which assigns different nature
   conservation priority scores to different taxa. The system developed by
   Millsap et al. (Wildlife Monograph 1990, 111: 1-57) has been modified
   and applied to the mammal, bird, reptile, and amphibian species of
   Hungary. Three variable groups have been compiled, including eight
   (measuring biological characteristics), three (features of the Hungarian
   population) and five (evaluation of research and conservation actions)
   variables, respectively. In cooperation with several experts, we gave
   scores to all 379 taxa considered. The most endangered taxon proved to
   be the Hungarian Meadow Viper (Vipera ursinii rakosiensis), which occurs
   only in Hungary with just a few hundred individuals. The species rank
   depends on the availability and quality of data, so it is urgent to
   devote more effort to survey and monitoring projects. We present a
   possible application of the species list, where the taxa are grouped
   according to their legal status in Hungary (strictly protected,
   protected, partly protected and not protected), and the validity of this
   categorisation was tested by applying multivariate discriminant
   analysis. Only 58.36\% of the species were correctly classified. The
   reasons for stronger than expected protection include popularity,
   attractiveness, and local rarity, while reasons for lower protection
   include preference for hunting and control of predators and pests.}},

Abstract = {{The Amsterdam albatross (Diomedea amsterdamensis) is one of the rarest
   bird species of world avifauna, consisting of a single population in the
   upland plateau of Amsterdam Island (SE Indian Ocean). All breeding birds
   of the population are today banded and a monitoring program involving
   mark-recapture procedures has been carried out continuously over the
   past 16 years. We present the first estimate of risk of decline for the
   Amsterdam albatross using a stochastic matrix population model, and
   evaluate the extent to which the measurement errors in demographic
   estimates may affect the baseline conservation assessment. We also
   estimate the potential effect that resumption of long-line fisheries in
   the vicinity of Amsterdam Island (one the alleged causes for its low
   numbers in the recent past) may have on the persistence of this
   population. Our results indicate that, in the absence of any impact of
   long-line fisheries, the Amsterdam albatross is unlikely to experience a
   decline larger than 20\% of the current population abundance over the
   next 50 years. Our results point out the difficulty to assess with
   certainty the extinction risk of small populations despite the
   availability of long term data on their demography. They suggest that a
   very cautious approach should be taken for the preservation of small
   populations of long-lived species that cannot sustain any level of
   incidental by-catch. Any new long-line fishery resuming in the foraging
   range of the Amsterdam albatross, but especially close to Amsterdam
   Island, may rapidly put this species at risk of extinction. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{In Canada, Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are at the
   northern edge of their range, occurring only in southeastern Alberta and
   southwestern Saskatchewan. The population in Canada has declined by 66\%
   to 92\% over the last 30 years. We used radio-telemetry to follow 20
   female Greater Sage-Grouse and monitor productivity in southeastern
   Alberta, and to assess habitat use at nesting and brood-rearing
   locations, All females attempted to nest. Mean clutch size (7.8 eggs per
   nest) was at the high end of the normal range for sage-grouse (typically
   6.6-8.2). Nest success (46\%) and breeding success (55\%) were within
   the range found for more southerly populations (15\% to 86\% and 15\% to
   70\%, respectively). Thirty-six percent of unsuccessful females
   attempted to renest. Fledging success was slightly lower than reported
   in other studies. Thus, reproductive effort does not appear to be
   related to the population decline. However, chick survival to greater
   than or equal to 50 days of age (mean = 18\%) was only about half of
   that estimated (35\%) for a stable or slightly declining population,
   suggesting that chick survival may be the most important factor reducing
   overall reproductive success and contributing to the decline of Greater
   Sa.-e-Grouse in Canada.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified post-fledging pre-independence behavior and survival in
   Lark Buntings (Calamospiza melanocorys) using radio-telemetry. Brood
   division was recorded in six broods and was maintained throughout the
   observed fledgling care period. Chicks were capable of short flights (up
   to 25 in) by fledgling day 6 and longer flights (to 100 m) by fledgling
   day 13. During the first three weeks after fledging, juveniles moved as
   far as 800 in from nests. Nine of 23 (39\%) monitored fledglings died
   within 15 days of fledging, primarily due to predation by raptors. Daily
   survival rates were 0.953 +/- 0.019 for fledgling days 0-9, 0.955 +/-
   0.038 for fledgling clays 10-20, and 0.953 +/- 0.015 for fledgling days
   0-20. The probability of surviving fledgling days 0-20 was 0.367. More
   quantification of juvenile survival is clearly needed to understand the

Abstract = {{The past three decades have seen major declines in populations of
   several species of amphibians at high elevations in eastern Puerto Rico,
   a region unique in the humid tropics because of the degree of
   environmental monitoring that bets taken place through the efforts of
   U.S. government agencies. I examined changes in environmental conditions
   by examining time-series data sets that extend back at least into the
   1980s, a period when frog populations were declining. The data include
   forest cover; annual mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperature;
   annual rainfall; rain and stream chemistry; and atmospheric-dust
   transport. I examined satellite imagery and air-chemistry samples from a
   single National Aeronautics and Space Administration aircraft flight
   across the Caribbean showing patches of pollutants, described as thin
   sheets or lenses, in the lower troposphere. The main source of these
   pollutants appeared to be fires from land clearing and deforestation,
   primarily in Africa. Some pollutant concentrations were high and, in the
   case of ozone, approached health limits set for urban air. Urban
   pollution impinging on Puerto Rico, dust generation from Africa
   (potential soil pathogens), and tropical forest burning (gaseous
   pollutants) have all increased during the last three decades,
   overlapping the timing of amphibian declines in eastern Puerto Rico.
   None of the data sets pointed directly to changes so extreme that they
   might be considered a direct lethal cause of amphibian declines in
   Puerto Rico. More experimental research is required to link any of these
   environmental factors to this problem.}},

Abstract = {{Non-native vertebrate predators pose a severe threat to many native
   species, and a variety of management programs are aimed at reducing
   predator effects. We sought to assess the effects of predator-control
   programs by analyzing changes in prey and predator populations based on
   data commonly collected in these programs. Me ( examined data from a
   predator-control program that primarily targets The introduced red fox
   (Vulpes vulpes regalis) in central California. Red foxes negatively
   affect populations of native waterbirds, particularly tbe endangered
   California Clapper Rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus). Using a
   combination of matrix population modeling, simple difference equations,
   and statistical analysis, we analyzed data on removed predators and
   monitored prey populations, Past control efforts succeeded in depressing
   fox numbers in local areas over 3-month intervals, and there was a
   significant, positive relationship between the growth rate of local
   Clapper Rail populations and the successful trapping of red foxes in the
   preceding year. By modeling tbe effect of different-fox-removal rates,
   we found that a stable or declining population could be achieved by
   removing a minimum of 50\% of the adults and 25\% of the juveniles.
   Under trapping rates of 50-70\%, the proportion of the fox population
   composed of immigrants averaged 20-52\%. In contrast to the current
   management approach, elasticity analyses suggested that changes in adult
   survival rates had relatively little cf(ect on long-term population
   growth. Overall, our approach indicated that predator control was
   effective in the short term, but for longer-term success it),nay be
   necessary, to redirect efforts to control juvenile and immigrant foxes.
   Our analytical approach) is potentially useful for evaluating current
   control programs aimed at reducing the effects of predators on native
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The African elephant (Loxodonta africana) experienced a poaching-related
   60\% population decline between 1979 and 1988 that was inordinately
   concentrated on adults. This, coupled with political pressures to delist
   the elephant, has created a need for non invasive physiological measures
   that can quantify the longterm effects of past mortality patterns of
   this long-lived species, We collected fresh fecal samples from 16 female
   elephants in three different groups over 23 months at Tarangire National
   Park, Tanzania, and analyzed them for fecal progesterone and cortisol
   metabolites. Social and ecological measures were collected concurrently.
   Fecal progesterone metabolite measures corresponded significantly with
   stage of gestation, and appear to be able to confirm pregnancy in female
   elephants from as early as 3 months of gestation. We found that
   progesterone metabolite concentrations were significantly lower during
   the dry, season than during the wet season after controlling for stage
   of gestation. Fecal cortisol metabolite concentrations showed the
   opposite seasonal pattern, being significantly higher in the di), season
   and inversely correlated with rainfall across seasons, Fecal cortisol
   metabolite concentrations also increased with group size and were
   correlated positively with dominance rank in the largest group. Our
   results suggest that measures of progesterone and cortisol metabolites
   in feces provide indices of reproductive function and physiological
   stress that can quantify both natural and human disturbances in African
   elephants. These measures are ideally suited for monitoring the
   long-term effects of social disruption from poaching and a variety of
   other management concerns.}},

Abstract = {{`It should be clear that the upper temperature limit for life cannot be
   accurately defined' (Schmidt-Nielsen 1996). The thermal physiology of
   zooxanthellate reef corals is reviewed in this paper in the context of
   organismal and biochemical responses occurring during coral bleaching,
   with emphasis on methods of detection and interpretation of animal and
   algal symbiont stress. Coral bleaching, as presently defined in the
   literature, is a highly subjective term used to describe a variety of
   conditions pertaining to low symbiont densities in the coral-algal
   complex, including response to thermal stress. Three general types of
   high-temperature bleaching are defined: physiological bleaching, which
   may or may not include higher-than-normal temperature responses;
   algal-stress bleaching, involving dysfunction of symbiotic algae at high
   light and/or high temperatures; and animal-stress bleaching, where coral
   cells containing symbiotic algae are shed from the gastrodermal layer of
   cells. Since none of these methods of bleaching is mutually exclusive, a
   combination of intrusive and nonintrusive techniques is necessary to
   determine which mechanisms of symbiont loss are occurring. While
   quantification of symbiont densities, algal pigments, and coral tissue
   biomass provide unambiguous evidence of bleaching severity, measurements
   of physiological and biochemical degradation offer additional
   correlative evidence of temperature stress. Pulse-amplitude-modulated
   (PAM) fluorometry has emerged as an easy and relatively inexpensive
   non-invasive technique for monitoring symbiotic algal function both in
   situ and in the laboratory, when proper assumptions and interpretations
   are made. The roles of global warming, water quality,
   acclimation/adaptation processes, and relation to coral disease and reef
   heterogeneity are also discussed. A thorough understanding of the
   organismal responses occurring during bleaching will help explain
   changes in coral populations and in the coral reef community, and
   perhaps assist in predicting the future of reef corals and coral reefs
   during the next century of global climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Viability analysis of well-selected focal species can complement
   ecosystem-level conservation planning by revealing thresholds in habitat
   area and landscape connectivity. Mammalian carnivores are good
   candidates for focal species because their distributional patterns often
   strongly reflect regional-scale population processes. We incorporated
   focal species analysis of four carnivore species, fisher (Martes
   pennanti), lynx (Lynx canadensis), wolverine (Gulo gulo), and grizzly
   bear (Ursus arctos), into a regional conservation plan for the Rocky
   Mountains of the United States and Canada. We developed empirical
   habitat models for fisher, lynx, and wolverine based on a geographically
   extensive data set of trapping and sighting records. Predictor variables
   derived directly from satellite imagery were significantly correlated
   with carnivore distribution and allowed us to predict distribution in
   areas lacking detailed vegetation data. Although we lacked similar
   distributional data for grizzly bear, we predicted bear habitat by
   adapting and extrapolating previously published, regional-scale habitat
   models. Predicted habitat for grizzly bear has high overlap with that
   for wolverine, intermediate overlap with fisher, and low overlap with
   lynx. High-quality habitats for fisher and lynx, unlike those for
   wolverine and grizzly bear, are not strongly associated with low levels
   of human population and roads. Nevertheless, they are naturally
   fragmented by topography and vegetation gradients and are poorly
   represented in existing protected areas. Areas with high biological
   productivity and low human impact are valuable habitat for all four
   species but are limited in extent. Predicted habitat values for lynx and
   wolverine are significantly correlated with trapping data from an area
   outside the extent of the original data set. This supports the use of
   empirical distribution models as the initial stage in a regional-scale
   monitoring program. Our results suggest that a comprehensive
   conservation strategy for carnivores in the region must consider the
   needs of several species, rather than a single, presumed umbrella
   species. Coordinated planning across multiple ownerships is necessary to
   prevent further fragmentation of carnivore habitat, especially in the
   U.S.-Canada border region.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable fresh water comprises a tiny fraction of the global water pool
   but is the foundation for life in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.
   The benefits to humans of renewable fresh water include water for
   drinking, irrigation, and industrial uses, for production of fish and
   waterfowl, and for such instream uses as recreation, transportation, and
   waste disposal.
   In the coming century, climate change and a growing imbalance among
   freshwater supply, consumption, and population will alter the water
   cycle dramatically. Many regions of the world are already limited by the
   amount and quality of available water. In the next 30 yr alone,
   accessible runoff is unlikely to increase more than 10\%, but the
   earth's population is projected to rise by approximately one-third.
   Unless the efficiency of water use rises, this imbalance will reduce
   freshwater ecosystem services, increase the number of aquatic species
   facing extinction, and further fragment wetlands, rivers, deltas, and
   estuaries.
   Based on the scientific evidence currently available, we conclude that:
   (1) over half of accessible freshwater runoff globally is already
   appropriated for human use; (2) more than 1 x 10(9) people currently
   lack access to clean drinking water and almost 3 x 10(9) people lack
   basic sanitation services; (3) because the human population will grow
   faster than increases in the amount of accessible fresh water, per
   capita availability of fresh water will decrease in the coming century;
   (4) climate change will cause a general intensification of the earth's
   hydrological cycle in the next 100 yr, with generally increased
   precipitation, evapotranspiration, and occurrence of storms, and
   significant changes in biogeochemical processes influencing water
   quality; (5) at least 90\% of total water discharge from U.S. rivers is
   strongly affected by channel fragmentation from dams, reservoirs,
   interbasin diversions, and irrigation; and (6) globally, 20\% of
   freshwater fish species are threatened or extinct, and freshwater
   species make up 47\% of all animals federally endangered in the United
   States.
   The growing demands on freshwater resources create an urgent need to
   link research with improved water management. Better monitoring,
   assessment, and forecasting of water resources will help to allocate
   water more efficiently among competing needs, Currently in the United
   States, at least six federal departments and 20 agencies share
   responsibilities for various aspects of the hydrologic cycle.
   Coordination by a single panel with members drawn from each department,
   or by a central agency, would acknowledge the diverse pressures on
   freshwater systems and could lead to the development of a
   well-coordinated national plan.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape patterns of foraging activity in sympatric species of
   subterranean termites were examined. Foraging activity was observed
   biweekly within a grid of wooden monitoring stations covering an area of
   approximate to 900 m(2). The number and spatial distribution of active
   monitoring stations within the grid were used to determine seasonal
   patterns of foraging activity for each species. Gaps in the spatial
   distribution Of Occupied monitoring stations were quantified using the
   lacunarity index. Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) and Reticulitermes
   hageni Banks were observed within monitoring stations throughout the
   study. The number and spatial distribution of occupied monitoring
   stations varied seasonally,. Seasonal patterns of activity and spatial
   distribution also varied between species. Lacunarity was highest for R.
   hageni during cool, wet months and highest for R. flavipes during hot,
   dry months. Seasonal changes in the number of active monitoring stations
   and their spatial distribution in the landscape were correlated with
   seasonal changes in soil temperature and soil moisture for both species.
   These patterns reflect differential degrees of adaptation to soil
   moisture and temperature extremes and could provide a mechanism for
   resource partitioning within the three-dimensional soil landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel, isa pest of
   rice in the seven rice producing states of the United States and several
   countries where it has been introduced. Carbofuran was used adequately
   for nearly 30 yr, but it is no longer registered for use in rice and has
   beet) replaced by lambda -cylialothrin (Karate) and diflubetizuron
   (Dimilin), The scouting methods for carboforan were inadequate or too
   late in determining the need for insecticide applications of the newer
   insecticides. Therefore, a new population monitoring method was;
   developed rising a double-ended aquatic barrier trap. The trap function
   was based on weevil swimming behavior, and 16 barrier trap prototypes
   were tested on adult weevils, 22-23 July, 1998, in a small bay of late
   planted rice. Adult means +/- SE were 73.9 +/- 9.4 per trap on 23 July
   1998 and 54.4 +/- 6.4 per trap on 24 July 1998. The core sample mean for
   this plot was 72.9 +/- 7.0 larvae per core. The trap was tested in both
   commercial fields and early and late planted small bays in 1999. Larval
   Weevil infestations ranged from moderate (near or slightly below the
   economic injury level (EIL) to high (62.8 per core). Regression analyses
   showed a significant correlation between adults captured in traps, to
   subsequent larval density in field edges (r(2) = 0.98) and field
   interiors (r(2) = 0.92). For every 1.0 ricewater weevil adult captured
   in barrier traps, a density of 1.2-2.8 larvae per core sample was
   predicted, The aquatic barrier traps caught adult weevils without lures.
   Trapping rice water weevil adults immediately after permanent flood in
   drill-seeded fields can be used to aid decision making for insecticide
   application in rice.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in using pheromone trap catches of the
   Nantucket pine tip moth, Rhyacionia frustrana (Comstock), to estimate or
   predict population density and damage. At six sites in the Georgia
   Piedmont, adult tip moths were monitored through one or more years using
   pheromone traps while population density and damage for each tip moth
   generation were determined. During most years, trap catch was higher
   during the first adult generation compared with subsequent generations
   regardless of population density. Within each generation, trap catch was
   moderately to highly correlated with associated population density or
   damage levels. Hyperbolic regression models best described these
   relationships and suggested trap saturation When populations are high.
   Trap catch during the first adult generation was highly predictive of
   population density or damage during the subsequent generation. Trap
   catch during the second adult generation was fair at predicting
   subsequent density or damage. The models presented herein should be used
   with caution because they are likely to be region-specific. Validation
   of these relationships is necessary before widespread application of
   these models is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to identify subgroups of the population
   susceptible to the effects of ambient air particles. Fixed-site air
   pollution monitors in Montreal; Quebec, Canada, provided daily mean
   levels of various measures of particulates and gaseous pollutants. Total
   sulfates were also measured daily (1986-1993) at a monitoring station
   150 km southeast of the city (Sutton, Quebec, Canada). We used
   coefficient of haze (COH), extinction coefficient, and Sutton sulfates
   to predict fine particles and sulfates from a fine particles model for
   days that were missing. We used the universal Quebec medicare system to
   obtain billings and prescriptions for each Montreal resident who died in
   the city from 1984 to 1993. These data were then used to-define
   cardiovascular and respiratory conditions that subjects had before
   death. Using standard Poisson regression time-series analyses, we
   estimated the association between daily nonaccidental mortality and
   daily concentrations of particles in the ambient air among persons with
   cardiovascular and respiratory conditions diagnosed before death. We
   found no persuasive evidence that daily mortality increased when ambient
   air particles were elevated for subgroups of persons with chronic upper
   respiratory diseases, airways disease, cerebrovascular diseases, acute
   coronary artery disease, and hypertension. However, we found that daily
   mortality increased linearly as concentrations of particles increased
   for persons who had acute lower respiratory diseases, chronic coronary
   artery diseases (especially in the elderly), and congestive heart
   failure. For this latter set of conditions, the mean percent increase in
   daily mortality (MPC) for an increase in the COH across its
   interquartile range (18.5 COH units per 327.8 linear meters), averaged
   over the day of death and the 2 preceding days, was MPC = 5.09\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 2.47-7.79\%], MPC = 2.62 (95\% CI 0.53-4.75\%),
   and MPC = 4.99 (95\% Cl 2.44-7.60\%), respectively. Adjustments for
   gaseous pollutants generally attenuated these associations, although the
   general pattern of increased daily mortality remained. In addition,
   there appeared to be a stronger association in the summer season. The
   positive associations found for persons who had acute lower respiratory
   diseases and congestive heart failure are consistent with some
   prevailing hypotheses and may also be consistent with recent toxicologic
   data implicating endothelins. Further epidemiologic studies are required
   to confirm these findings.}},

Abstract = {{The geysers panic grass {[}Dichanthelium lanuginosum Spellenberg var,
   thermale (Bol.) Spellenberg or DILA] is exclusively associated with
   surface geothermal manifestations in Sonoma County, California. USA (38
   degrees 46'N, 122 degrees 38'W). Steam extraction by power plants could
   alter the subsurface distribution of heat and water to the site,
   potentially impacting subpopulations of this rare plant. The purpose of
   this study was to use demographic monitoring to determine: (1) temporal
   and spatial patterns of soil temperature in relation to the distribution
   of established DILA individuals at Little Geysers, (2) in situ response
   of experimental populations of DILA to spatial Variations in soil
   temperature, and (3) habitat requirements of DILA as an indicator of its
   tolerance to variations in surficial geothermal features. Thermocouple
   transects and a datalogger provided data for characterizing the spatial
   and temporal patterns of soil temperature in four microhabitats
   (fumarole, DILA stand, Andropogon stand, and cleared). Experimental
   populations were established by precisely sowing and monitoring DILA
   seeds in these microhabitats. The results indicated that spatial and
   temporal variations in soil temperature had significant effects on the
   processes of germination, growth, survivorship, and reproduction, thus
   producing a readily observed metapopulation patch dynamic in relation to
   geothermal activity. Seasonal depressions of soil temperature near the
   fumaroles by cold air and prolonged rainfall events also promoted the
   emergence and survival of DILA seedlings in a microhabitat that was
   previously too hot to occupy. Over longer periods of time, DILA,
   metapopulation dynamism reflected climatic and geothermal variation.
   Drought, years inhibited germination for lack of water, but more
   importantly for the lack of requisite soil temperature depressions in
   the fumarole microhabitat. Wet years promoted subpopulation expansion
   into transition areas that were once too hot and dry. There have also
   been shifts in the underground distribution of steam into areas distant
   from known geothermal features. The demographic responses of DILA to
   spatial and temporal variations in soil temperature indicate that heat
   is an absolutely essential component of the steam resource, in its
   absence, germination, seeding survivorship. growth, and maturation are
   significantly inhibited even if soil conditions are favorable and
   potential competitors are controlled. Ultimately, persistence of the
   species depends on maintaining the ecosystem dynamic of colonization and
   extirpation in response to variations in surficial geothermal features
   over long spatial and temporal Scales. This should shift management
   perspective from its narrow focus on individual plants to a wider focus
   on monitoring the essential habitat component of steam.}},

Abstract = {{Power analysis and sample-size determination are related tools that have
   recently gained popularity in the environmental sciences. Their
   indiscriminate application, however, can lead to wildly misleading
   results. This is particularly true in environmental monitoring and
   assessment, where the quality and nature of data is such that the
   implicit assumptions underpinning power and sample-size calculations are
   difficult to justify. When the assumptions are reasonably met these
   statistical techniques provide researchers with an important capability
   for the allocation of scarce and expensive resources to detect putative
   impact or change. Conventional analyses are predicated on a general
   linear model and normal distribution theory with statistical tests of
   environmental impact couched in terms of changes in a population mean.
   While these are `optimal' statistical tests (uniformly most powerful),
   they nevertheless pose considerable practical difficulties for the
   researcher. Compounding this difficulty is the subsequent analysis of
   the data and the impost of a decision framework that commences with aa
   assumption of `no effect'. This assumption is only discarded when the
   sample data indicate demonstrable evidence to the contrary. The
   alternative ('green') view is that any anthropogenic activity has an
   impact on the environment and therefore a more realistic initial
   position is to assume that the environment is already impacted. In this
   article we examine these issues and provide a re-formulation of
   conventional mean-based hypotheses in terms of population percentiles.
   Prior information or belief concerning the probability of exceeding a
   criterion is incorporated into the power analysis using a Bayesian
   approach. Finally, a new statistic is introduced which attempts to
   balance the overall power regardless of the decision framework adopted.

Abstract = {{Estuarine fish populations are exposed to a variety of environmental
   conditions that cause both shortterm variability and long-term trends in
   abundance. We analyzed an extensive data set for striped bass (Morone
   saxatilis) in the San Francisco Estuary to refine our understanding of
   how environmental variability influences recruitment. We examined the
   effects of environmental variability during early life stages on
   subsequent recruitment (age 3 yr), and the degree to which conditions in
   early fife may have contributed to a long-term decline in abundance of
   adult striped bass in the San Francisco Estuary. Survival from egg to
   young-of-the-year: varied strongly with freshwater flow; this effect
   apparently occurred within the first week or two of life, a time period
   that encompasses transport of eggs and larvae from the rivers to rearing
   areas and the onset of feeding. The rate of freshwater flow to pumping
   facilities that export freshwater from the system had small or sporadic
   effects on survival during the first month or two of life. Although many
   young striped bass between ages 2 and 8 mo were entrained in export
   pumping facilities, the resulting high mortality was unrelated to total
   mortality rates determined from field data on young striped bass. Tins
   lack of effect was apparently due to strong density-dependent mortality
   occurring between ages 1 mo and 3 yr (Kimmerer et al. 2000). The
   available data do not support previously suggested relationships between
   recruitment and freshwater flow during early life, or between gross
   estimates of pesticide input and survival of early life stages. We used
   a simple life-cycle model to show that various combined factors could
   have led to a decline in adult abundance, particularly a large and
   increasing adult mortality, but that events early in life probably did
   not contribute substantially to the decline. These results demonstrate
   that several decades of monitoring data from numerous life stages are
   needed to distinguish among alternative hypotheses about environmental
   influences on populations of estuarine fish.}},

Abstract = {{The two major field methods (body colour and pleopod index) for the
   diagnosis of infection in the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus by the
   dinoflagellate parasite Hematodinium were compared. Using the more
   reliable method. the pleopod index. which scores infection severity on a
   four-point scale. infection prevalence data were collected from a single
   fishing ground in the Clyde Sea area, western Scotland over a continuous
   period of 31 months. Peak infection prevalence occurs during the spring
   and is highest in small N norvegicus {[}mean carapace length 38.1
   (+/-0.67)mm in females and 30.9 (+/- 0.50) mm in males] and in females.
   Mean infection severity increased from 1.05 +/- 0.03 during the low
   season (July-December) to 2.59 +/- 0.19 by the end of the main infection
   season (May), highlighting the progressive nature of patent infection
   over time. Infection prevalence is synchronous between the sexes in some
   seasons but not in others. Additionally, the proportion of recently
   moulted, infected males in the late season extends the duration of peak
   infection prevalence in certain years. Data from two adjacent fishing
   grounds in the Clyde Sea area also show that infection prevalence
   depends upon the population structure at a given site the site with
   smaller animals showing the higher prevalence. An evaluation of methods
   for monitoring Hematodinium infection suggests that the pleopod method
   gives the most accurate estimation of prevalence in field-caught
   lobsters. (C) 2001 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.}},

Title = {{The influence of management regime and altitude on the population
   structure of Succisa pratensis: implications for vegetation monitoring}},

Abstract = {{1. Environmental change and land use may alter the vegetation typical of
   wetland habitats. However, commonly used techniques for vegetation
   monitoring that are based on species composition are often not suitable
   to detect gradual changes in the structure of vegetation at an early
   stage. In this study we tested if this methodical deficiency could be
   overcome by observation of the stage structure of a perennial target
   species.
   2. We studied the density and frequency distribution of four
   phenological stages of the perennial plant Succisa pratensis in 24
   calcareous fens in eastern Switzerland. These fens differed in
   management type (mowing, cattle-grazing) and altitude (low. medium,
   high). Among grazed fens, the intensity of management was quantified by
   direct observation. Species composition and canopy structure of the
   plant community surrounding S. pratensis were also measured.
   3. High altitude had a positive effect on the density of adult plants of
   S. pratensis only in mown fens, whereas in grazed fens adult density was
   highest at medium altitude.
   4. Local densities of seedlings and vegetative adults within a fen were
   higher in mown than in grazed fens, and lower in fens of the lowest
   altitude level than of the two higher ones. However, there were no
   differences in the relative proportions of all four phenological stages
   among main factors except that significantly fewer seedlings occurred in
   fens of the lowest altitude level.
   5. It is the intensity rather than the mere type of management regime
   that is crucial for shaping populations of S. pratensis: for grazed
   fens, there is a negative relationship between intensity of grazing and
   density of adult plants of S. pratensis'. Moreover, the number, the
   relative proportion of seedlings and the seed-set are all negatively
   correlated with grazing intensity.
   6. The species composition of the plant community, but not its physical
   structure, was significantly related to the relative proportion of
   seedlings of S. pratensis, which supports the indicator qualities of the
   target species.
   7. Monitoring the population structure of one or several target species
   provides important indicator information about the stability of a whole
   plant community. For the target-species approach we propose to use
   characteristic but frequently and steadily occurring species instead of
   rare or endangered ones.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{888-895}},

Abstract = {{1. The development and calibration of a land-based technique to measure
   inter-animal spacing in free-ranging coastal cetaceans is described
   here. The technique was developed to study the behaviour of killer
   whales Orcinus orca in Norway.
   2. A theodolite was used to measure the surfacing location of one
   reference individual while simultaneous video recordings of the whole
   group were made. Digitized video frames were then used to estimate the
   locations of all individuals in the video frame relative to the
   reference animal.
   3. The technique was calibrated using a line of towed buoys with known
   separations. Estimated inter-buoy distances were compared with actual
   values to calculate errors. There was no observable bias in
   measurements, with a mean error of -0.014 m (n = 304, SD = 0.880). At
   ranges up to 2 km from the observation site, 95\% of measurements were
   accurate to within 1.7 m.
   4. The accuracy of the measurement system was characterized with a set
   of Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations were run at offshore ranges from
   100 m to 2000 m, with random perturbations applied to all variables.
   Errors in inter-animal distances for n = 16 whales were estimated using
   10 000 simulation runs for every range value. The results from the
   simulations agreed with experimental findings. The results showed no
   bias in inter-animal distance measurements, with an overall mean error
   of 0.0864 m.
   5. The results indicate that this technique is suitable for studies on a
   variety of coastal cetacean populations. It provides a new tool for
   quantitative studies on spatial behaviour of cetaceans, and will help
   underpin management efforts to monitor effects of anthropogenic
   disturbance. With modification, the technique might also be applicable
   to other coastal vertebrates where inter-organism distances are
   required.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a critical review of the main issues regarding the
   scientific principles underlying environmental monitoring of marine
   aquaculture operations and makes recommendations relevant to the
   implementation of best practice for the management of aquaculture in
   Europe. Given that a variety of cultured species and approaches are
   adopted in Europe, it is not possible, or indeed desirable, to devise
   prescriptive guidelines. Instead, this paper reviews how science informs
   monitoring and provides a framework for the development of a monitoring
   strategy of marine aquaculture operations that is flexible enough to be
   applicable to a variety of locations, species and situations.
   Traditionally environmental monitoring has concentrated on a few key
   physical and chemical variables and organisms. The trend now, however,
   is towards whole-system environmental assessment (e.g. CEC 2000;
   Osparcom 1998), including considerations of the assimilative capacity of
   specific systems and their ability to absorb and dilute perturbations.
   Against this background this paper addresses the following specific
   objectives:
   review of the rationale and scientific principles underlying current
   environmental monitoring with specific reference to marine aquaculture;
   evaluation of the links between monitoring and regulatory criteria,
   specifically consideration of environmental quality objectives and
   environmental quality standards, and the role of environmental impact
   assessments
   assessment of the role of codes of best conduct and practice, and
   environmental management systems in the management of aquaculture
   operations.
   The paper concludes by proposing a set of recommendations which will
   contribute towards the sustainable management of aquaculture operations,
   through the implementation of a more focused approach to environmental
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton assemblages and their physicochemical environment were
   investigated during 1997-98 at a marine long-term coastal monitoring
   station off Sydney, Australia, and compared to those previously seen at
   this location. Phytoplankton blooms (significant population increases)
   coincided with episodic slope water intrusions (upwelling/uplifting)
   lasting 2-22 days and occurring from September to February. These blooms
   appeared to occur in response to slope water intrusions. The
   hydrological forcing variables of bottom- and surface-water nutrients
   and temperature, (including time-lagged data), were identified using
   Principal Component Analysis as those variables that explained 60\% of
   the variability of the total phytoplankton biomass throughout the year.
   Phytoplankton blooms of similar frequency and magnitude to those seen in
   this study have been previously recorded. However, in contrast to
   earlier work, where a variety of taxa dominated throughout the year, the
   small diatom Thalassiosira partheneia generally dominated blooms in this
   study. In addition, presence/absence data for the heterotrophic
   dinoflagellate, Noctiluca scintillans, indicated a higher frequency of
   occurrence for this species than previously documented. N. scintillans
   was observed in 61\% of samples collected throughout the year, being
   absent from only a few samples in the autumn and winter months. It is
   hypothesized that the shift in dominance from previously recorded bloom
   species to Thalassiosira could be a contributing factor to the increase
   in N. scintillans (a favored food source by N. scintillans) in NSW
   coastal waters. The reason for the recent dominance of these particular
   phytoplankters is unclear but may be related to physicochemical
   conditions such as a decrease in phosphate and oxidized nitrogen
   concentrations and warmer water temperatures experienced during our
   sampling period compared to previous years. A phytoplankton inventory is
   included as an Appendix. This includes what appears to be the first
   record of the potentially toxic diatom Pseudonitzschia australis in
   Australian waters and the first record of the harmless diatom
   Pleurosigma chilensis since its ``type{''} description from the coastal
   waters of Southern Chile, 1941.}},

Year = {{2001}},

Pages = {{87-95}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Warm nutrient-poor water, associated with the 1997/98 El Nino, dominated
   conditions along Australia's east coast for the majority of 1997.
   Towards the end of the El Nino event, anomalously cool nutrient-rich
   water prevailed in coastal waters in response to a strong upwelling
   associated with enhanced dynamics from the East Australian Current and
   upwelling favourable winds. The upwelling was consistent with
   anomalously cool conditions observed during the demise of previous El
   Nino periods at the study location. Phytoplankton responses included
   blooms of the small centric diatom Thalassiosira spp. and the large
   heterotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans. Repetitive
   physico-chemical and biological sampling along cross-shelf transect
   lines combined with a 300km alongshore array of thermistor moorings, and
   ground-truthed SeaWiFS observations, captured this event. Enhanced East
   Australian Current activity to the north, and upwelling favourable winds
   across the study region, promoted cool nutrient-rich slope-waters to be
   uplifted onto the continental shelf. Thermistor records suggest this
   event swamped the entire study region in early January 1998 and remained
   until early February 1998. Cross-spectral phase analysis of the records
   confirms these spatial and temporal observations. Nutrient levels peaked
   at the 99\%ile value of records from 57 years monitoring at the study
   location. Slope-waters uplifted to the euphotic zone, enhanced
   populations of both primary and secondary phytoplankton bloom species,
   which extended to mid February 1998. SeaWiFS imagery indicates the
   formation of a cyclonic back-eddy on the inshore edge of the East
   Australian Current, and in the lee of a major topographic protrusion.
   This back-eddy isolates slope-waters and incubates phytoplankton,
   leaking alongshore with the general southward streamflow. Assessments of
   the reproductive status and feeding activity of Noctiluca indicate a
   maturing population with increasing southerly extent, thereby supporting
   satellite observations.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of major sewage and estuarine discharges on nutrient
   distributions in central New South Wales (NSW) coastal waters were
   investigated. The hinterland of the study region includes the sewerage
   and rainwater catchments of major population centres of Newcastle,
   Sydney and Wollongong. New South Wales discharges the majority of its
   treated sewage to the ocean, with about 80\% from just three deepwater
   outfalls off Sydney. These discharges were found to be the principal,
   continuous, anthropogenic source of nutrients to NSW coastal waters. The
   deepwater ouffalls delivered most of their nitrogen as ammonia and were
   responsible for nutrient (NH4-N and PO4-P) enrichment within usually
   submerged effluent plumes. Direct observations and modelling indicate
   that after initial dilution, effluent plumes typically occupy similar to
   30 m of the water column (60-80 m). Rapid initial dilution was observed
   with subsequent gradual far field dispersion typically broadening the
   effluent field to1-2 kilometres by about 10 kilometres downstream. Flows
   generally follow isobaths, predominantly to the south. Vertical and
   seasonal distributions of sewage derived nutrients, were estimated from
   a 6 year record of initial dilution modelling and effluent data.
   Comparisons were made with ambient nutrient distributions derived from
   long term monitoring prior to the commissioning of the ouffalls (1990),
   at the CSIRO Port Hacking Station (5 to 10 kilometres south of the
   deepwater ouffalls). The pycnocline seasonally limited the vertical
   extent of sewage plumes emitted from the deepwater outfalls.
   Upwelling/uplifting processes were associated with stratified conditions
   during spring and summer. Therefore, density stratification was a
   critical factor in determining the vertical movement of oceanic and
   sewage derived nutrients into the euphotic zone. Despite clear nutrient
   enrichment due to sewage discharges, no new evidence has been presented
   to contradict previous findings that algal blooms are principally driven
   by oceanic nutrient enrichment. However, by considering simulations of
   near field effluent plume behaviour in relation to long term ambient
   nutrient patterns we have identified specific periods of the year and
   depth intervals with maximum risk of outfall impacts, such as the upper
   half of the water column during late summer.}},

Abstract = {{Guia marine outfall is the largest sewage discharge system in Portuguese
   waters. It serves four municipalities and a population of approximately
   600,000 inhabitants. Effluent diffusion occurs approximately 3 Km from
   the shore, at a depth of 40 meters. Operation of the outfall was
   initiated in May/June 1994 and, at present, does not include secondary
   treatment, or conventional primary treatment.
   In March 1994, before operation of the outfall, an integrated monitoring
   program was designed, which included a baseline sediment survey.
   Environmental chemistry, macrofaunal benthic communities and laboratory
   sediment toxicity analyses were performed in sediments from 20 sampling
   sites. These sites were revisited 3 and 4.5 years later in order to
   evaluate any changes to the sediments and their associated biota. This
   paper presents the results obtained from those two sampling periods, and
   proposes a classification for the evolution of sediment status. It also
   addresses the need or not to introduce, at present, more elaborate
   effluent treatment methods.}},

Abstract = {{1 Plants often suffer substantial loss of seeds to consumers. However,
   because the seed-to-seedling transition is frequently ignored,
   quantitative estimates of the effects of seed consumers on plant
   population dynamics are rare.
   2 We examined how post-dispersal seed predation by rodents affected
   seedling emergence and subsequent adult plant abundance of bush lupine
   (Lupinus arboreus), a large N-fixing shrub common to coastal dunes in
   California. We monitored patterns of seedling emergence and survival
   over 3 years for seeds sown into exclosed and control plots.
   3 We sowed additional cohorts of seeds in the second and third years and
   compared interannual variation in emergence patterns.
   4 Rodent exclusion substantially reduced seedling emergence, with an
   average of 109 seedlings emerging over 3 years from 476 seeds sown in
   rodent exclusion plots vs. 26 from control plots. The intensity of
   granivory, however, varied between years, with rodent exclusion
   increasing emergence from seeds sown in year one, but not in year two.
   5 Winter seedling mortality, due to cutworm herbivory, was similarly
   high in rodent-free and control plots, and its net impact was to reduce
   the difference in seedling abundance. Thus. by mid-summer in each of the
   three years, there were only marginally more seedlings in
   rodent-excluded vs. control plots.
   6 The cumulative effect of protecting seeds, was, however, large. After
   3 years, an average of four adult lupines were established in
   rodent-free plots, whereas only 0.5 were found in control plots and
   lupine biomass was more than 5-fold higher in exclusion plots.
   7 Taken together, the results indicate that rodents play a critical role
   by limiting the abundance and biomass of a large N-fixing shrub in
   dunes.}},

Abstract = {{Subterranean insect pests cause considerable economic damage but their
   concealment makes detection difficult, A portable acoustic system was
   developed and tested for it's potential to rate the likelihood that
   trees in citrus groves were infested with Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.)
   larvae. The likelihood was rated independently by a computer program and
   an experienced listener that distinguished insect sounds from background
   noises. Diaprepes abbreviatus, Phyllophaga spp., or other pest insects
   were excavated from all 11 sites rated at high likelihood of infestation
   but were absent from 20 of 25 low-rated sites. There was a significant
   regression between the activity rate and the number of pest organisms
   present at recording sites although the correlation was weaker,than
   between activity rate and likelihood of infestation. Although the system
   is at an early stage of development, the success of these field tests
   suggests that it has considerable potential as a tool to detect and
   monitor hidden infestations of insects in soil.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial insecticides play an increasingly important role in mosquito
   control, To establish guidelines for detecting resistance at an early
   stage, information on natural variation in susceptibility of insect
   populations to these insecticides is needed. Between 1990 and 1993, the
   susceptibility of Culex pipiens L. complex to Bacillus thuringiensis
   subsp, israelensis de Barjac and/or Bacillus sphaericus Neide was
   determined in 31 collections from California. These collections were
   undertaken before the widespread use of B. thuringiensis subsp,
   israelensis and before the registration of B. sphaericus in California.
   Seven collections from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where no
   microbial insecticides have been used, also were tested. The 1990-1991
   California collections exhibited limited variation in susceptibility to
   B. thuringiensis subsp, israelensis. LC50 and LC95 values spanned about
   a three-fold and four-fold range, respectively, The 1993 Cyprus
   collections exhibited both higher mean LC values, and greater
   variability in those values, than the California collections. The
   LC(50)s for the Cyprus collections varied over a 10-fold range, whereas
   the LC(95)s varied over a 12.5-fold range. Variation in susceptibility
   to B. sphaericus among the 1991 California collections was about
   five-fold at the LC50 and LC95. No significant geographic variation in
   susceptibility to B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis was observed among
   regions within California. Although variation in susceptibility was
   limited among California collections, the greater variability observed
   among the Cyprus collections and between the Cyprus and California
   collections illustrates the importance of establishing regional
   baselines to monitor accurately for changes in susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{Susceptibility of adult populations of the western corn
   rootworm,Diabrotica virgifera LeConte, to carbaryl was determined by a
   survey in 1996 before the implementation of an areawide, management
   program near Scandia in north central Kansas. Subsequently, the
   susceptibility of western corn rootworm adults to carbaryl has been
   monitored throughout the program from 1997 to 2000 in both control and
   managed areas. In 1996, adults were highly susceptible to carbaryl with
   a mean LC50 value of 0.64 mug/vial. This value was comparable to those
   for adults collected from other regions within Kansas. However, adult
   susceptibility to carbaryl decreased rapidly within the managed area,
   where the cucurbitacin carbaryl-based bait SLAM has been used as the
   primary tool to control adults in this project since 1997. In 1999,
   adults collected from the managed area were 9- and 20-fold less
   susceptible to carbaryl at the LC50 and LC95 levels, respectively, than
   those evaluated in 1996. In contrast, adults collected from the control
   area were only 2- and 3-fold less susceptible to carbaryl at the LC95
   and LC90 levels, respectively, than adults evaluated in 1996. Although
   field adult populations of western corn rootworm were relatively low in
   2000, evaluations showed trends similar to those in 1999 regarding their
   carbaryl susceptibility in the managed and control areas. These results
   provide evidence that western corn rootworm has been evolving carbaryl
   resistance rapidly in response to the use of SLAM in areawide-man aged
   cornfields near Scandia.}},

Abstract = {{Population monitoring of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata
   (Wiedemann), was studied in 1998 in a mixed-fruit orchard in northern
   Greece, using International Pheromone McPhail traps (IPMT) baited with
   the female targeted attractants ammonium acetate, putrescine, and
   trimethylamine, and Jackson traps baited with the male specific
   parapheromone trimedlure. Special emphasis was placed on detecting the
   low initial adult population resulting from surviving overwintering
   larvae as early as possible in the spring and early summer. Traps were
   suspended on various host trees, using trap grid densities of either 15
   or 1.5 traps per hectare. The first adults detected were females
   captured on 24 June in IPMT traps suspended on apricot trees, which are
   among the earliest maturing hosts in the area, From the end of July, the
   most effective trap was the IPMT trap placed on peaches, which followed
   apricots in the fruit ripening sequence. IPMT traps captured
   predominately females (approximate to 80\% of the total captures) and by
   far outperformed Jackson traps in early detection (the first males in
   Jackson traps were captured in August) as well as in total captures
   until mid-October, After mid-October, however, more flies were captured
   in Jackson traps. Comparing the performance of two trap grid densities
   on apple trees (the common,host in the two grids), we found that in the
   high-density trap grid the first adults were detected I wk earlier than
   in the low-density trap gild. Our findings for this locality suggest
   that trap type and plant species on which traps are suspended are of key
   importance in early detection and population monitoring of C. capitata.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored use of plants and habitat in a population of thamin (Cervis

   through 1999. Habitat use within the deciduous dipterocarp forest was
   monitored by radiotracking 19 individuals during daylight hours and
   conducting biannual fecal pellet surveys along 87 km of marked
   transects. Habitat abundance was determined by classifying a LANDSAT
   image of the region, collecting vegetation parameters at 201 plots
   located within the sanctuary, and pacing habitat types along marked
   transects. Thamin consumed primarily forbs, grasses, and agricultural
   crops but also fruits of 8 common tree species. Thamin used dipterocarp
   forest habitat but showed some seasonal shifts and distinct individual
   differences in habitat use. Except during of the mating season
   (January-April), females were found more often in degraded forests and
   closer to crops than males. Sex differences in habitat selection were
   due to either female selection of habitats with lower predation risk or
   increased nutritional needs associated with lactation.}},

Abstract = {{Ivermectin treatment may induce marked adverse effects in those
   harbouring > 8000 Loa microfilariae (mff)/ml of blood, individuals with
   > 30 000 Loa mff/ml being at risk of developing serious neurological
   reactions. It is thus necessary to delineate the geographical areas
   where such responses may occur. To determine if the simple measure of
   prevalence of Loa microfilaraemia would be appropriate to identify the
   communities at risk, the relationships between prevalence and intensity
   of Loa microfilaraemia were investigated in 67 villages in Cameroon. The
   prevalence recorded in the adult population was found to be closely
   related to each of the indicators of infection intensity investigated.
   For example, when the prevalences of Loa microfilaraemia in adults were
   20\%, 30\% and 40\%, approximately 5\%, 9\% and 16\% of the adults had
   microfilarial loads exceeding 8000 mff/ml, respectively; the
   corresponding percentages of adults with > 30 000 mff/ml were about 1\%,
   3\% and 5\%-6\%. Thus it seems that, in areas where loiasis is
   co-endemic, the monitoring procedure during large-scale ivermectin
   treatments for the control of onchocerciasis only needs to be
   strengthened in those communities where the prevalence of Loa
   microfilaraemia in adults exceeds 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{We compared three techniques for estimating the number of steelhead
   Oncorhynchus mykiss smolts emigrating from tire Betsie River in
   northwestern Michigan and evaluated the effect of sampling effort oil
   estimates of annual production of smolts. In May and June 1993-1996, we
   used visual observations, time-lapse videography, and mark-recapture to
   estimate the number of emigrating hatchery and wild steelhead smolts,
   Based on the proportions of cacti species captured by trapping, hatchery
   and wild steelhead smolts composed 30-61\% of all emigrating juvenile
   salmonids, which also included brown trout Salmo trutta, coho salmon
   Oncorhynchus kisutch, and chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha.
   Annually, wild steelhead composed 12-52\% of all steelhead smolts.
   Mark-recapture estimates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for
   steelhead smolts ranged from 13.836 (13,219-14,495) in 1995 to 56,660
   (50,721-63,834) in 1993. Mark-recapture estimates yielded results that
   were up to nine times greater than those from observational methods.
   Estimates of smolt abundance (+/-2 SEs) from visual observation and
   videography were similar to one another and ranged from 3,097 (+/-690)
   in 1996 to 11, 118 (+/-3,882) in 1994. A random sampling protocol with
   different levels of effort fur nightly sampling demonstrated a trend for
   estimates that exceeded the confidence intervals when less than 75\% or
   the nights were sampled. With additional refinements, surface view
   videography is a promising technique for use in monitoring emigrating
   smolts. We recommend that assumptions on marked-fish behavior be
   confirmed to avoid overestimating fish abundance in mark-recapture
   applications, such as for trapping efficiency or estimates of smolt
   abundance. When considering a study design for estimating smolts, tire
   desired levels of precision for the data should be considered in
   determining the costs and benefits of sampling with high intensity.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, populations of the apple scab pathogen Venturia
   inaequalis have progressed through three consecutive rounds of fungicide
   resistance development, first to dodine, then to the benzimidazoles, and
   most recently to the sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). Analysis of
   extensive monitoring data have to date provided no indication of
   detectable cross-resistance or partial cross-resistance of V. inaequalis
   populations to the three unrelated classes of fungicides prior to the
   selection of resistant subpopulations. However, in this study,
   resistance to both benomyl and DMIs developed to significantly higher
   frequencies within the previously established dodine-resistant
   population than in the population sensitive to dodine. Accelerated
   selection of phenotypes double resistant to dodine and the DMI fenarimol
   was apparent over the course of distinct seasons of apple scab
   management with either dodine or fenarimol. The data provide evidence
   for an accelerated speed of resistance development among phenotypes of
   V. inaequalis already resistant to an unrelated fungicide. This finding
   represents a departure from the previous model, which assumed entirely
   independent rounds of resistance developments. The data indicate that
   phenotypes of V. inaequalis might not only be selected for the trait of
   fungicide resistance but also for traits allowing a more flexible
   response to changes in the environment where they compete.}},

Abstract = {{The hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria, pupal distribution was studied
   through a 3-year outbreak cycle near Lac Princeton on Anticosti Island
   in Quebec. Over the 3 years, 10 balsam fir trees were cut and all pupae
   were counted on the stem and branches (non-foliated vs foliated parts)
   of the lower, middle and upper crowns and on the stem below crown. In
   pre-outbreak conditions, pupae were mostly found on branches of the
   middle and upper crowns. During the outbreak, pupal density did not
   increase on these parts of the trees, since pupae were mostly found on
   the stem, from the ground to the middle crown, and on branches of the
   lower crown. Few pupae were found on the foliated portion of branches in
   post-outbreak conditions but most were found on the basal non-foliated
   part of branches, which appears to be a preferred location for hemlock
   looper pupation. In order to optimize detection of population increases
   in monitoring networks, we suggest using pupal traps at breast height on
   balsam fir trees.}},

Volume = {{85}},

Pages = {{910-918}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of plant health takes place in citrus nurseries to prevent
   the distribution of infected plants to commercial groves. In this
   article, both analytical and simulation methods are used to characterize
   schemes by which such monitoring may be carried out, in the particular
   context of Citrus tristeza virus infection. Two aspects of such schemes
   are discussed in detail. The inclusiveness of a sample is an assessment
   of the degree of redundancy that occurs because, in some samples, the
   progeny of identically infected propagation material may appear more
   than once. The operating characteristic function shows the probability
   of reaching a decision, based on sampling, that a population of daughter
   plants has an incidence of infection less than or equal to some adopted
   threshold level for any actual level of incidence in the population. If
   the same proportion of the population is assessed at different
   population sizes, both the inclusiveness and the operating
   characteristic function vary with population size. However, sample sizes
   may be calculated so that a specified operating characteristic function
   is maintained as population size varies. The sample sizes required to
   meet the conditions specified on the operating characteristics do not
   increase proportionally with population size. Under such a scheme, fewer
   samples might need to be taken from large populations of daughter plants
   than would be the case if a constant percentage sampling scheme were
   adopted.}},

Abstract = {{In 1990, a monitoring programme was initiated to survey the status of
   benthic invertebrate communities and fish populations over a wide range
   of subarctic rivers in northernmost Finnish Lapland (68 degrees 15'-70
   degreesN). A special emphasis was placed on detecting possible effects
   of acidification through sulfur emissions from Russian Kola Peninsula.
   Sampling in 13 rivers within four major river systems covered
   watercourses from small brooks to large 7(th) order rivers, and
   watersheds with different distances from the emission sources. The
   community structure of zoobenthos and the occurrence of acid-sensitive
   indicator species were assessed in 90 sampling sites. Sensitive fluvial
   fish species, including Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout
   (Salmo trutta), European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) and burbot (Lota
   Iota), were monitored by studying their occurrence, abundance and
   juvenile recruitment. No signs of acid-induced failure in juvenile
   recruitment were detected in salmonid populations. The occurrence of
   minnow and burbot covered all the systems studied. In parallell, the
   structure of benthic communities with relatively high species diversity
   and wide distribution of a highly acid-sensitive caddisfly indicated no
   effects of acidification.}},

Abstract = {{Heermann's Gulls (Lams heermanni) have been reported to nest on 19
   islands in Mexico, but during 1999-2000 they bred on only twelve. Of the
   known active colonies. one, Isla Rasa, harbors over 95\% of the breeding
   numbers. with between 300,000-400,000 adults. Three islands each support
   between 2,000 and 20,000 adults, and the rest front 4 to 2,000 adults.
   The colonies of this species have exhibited major variations through
   time, but data are inadequate to judge whether human activities or
   changes in oceanographic conditions were the cause of these variations.
   These two, along with size and distribution of nesting colonies, should
   be monitored, if the species' population dynamics are to be understood.}},

Abstract = {{We studied American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) by examining
   reproductive success and the factors affecting it at one location, and
   by examining the status and trends of breeding population numbers from
   Florida to Nova Scotia on the east coast of North America. We conducted
   our field research on Cape Lookout National Seashore, Carteret County.
   North Carolina from 1997 to 1999, and we documented larger scale
   breeding population trends by contacting state biologists and reviewing
   the literature and historical accounts. Presence of eggs and young were
   checked two to five tunes per week (by observing from a distance), and
   efforts were made to determine the reasons for loss of the nest
   contents. We monitored a total of 245 nests and found low productivity.
   At least one egg in 32 (13\%) nests hatched and one or more chicks
   fledged from 12 broods. Overall, 14 chicks successfully fledged (nine
   from North Core Banks and five from South Core Banks) during the three
   years of the study. Of the 213 clutches that did not hatch, 163 (76\%)
   failed because of predation, and 46 (22\%) because of overwash or severe
   weather. Our minimum estimate for the number of oystercatchers breeding
   along the entire Atlantic coast and the Gulf coast of Florida is 1,624
   pairs. North of Virginia, numbers appear to be stable or slowly
   increasing and the species has expanded as far north as Cape Sable
   Island in Nova Scotia. From Virginia south, breeding numbers show a
   decline in recent years. The number of oystercatchers breeding on
   barrier islands in Virginia has decreased by more than 50\% in the last
   20 years. Given their relatively small numbers and inherently low
   productivity, American Oystercatchers are at risk in rapidly changing
   coastal ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-one American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) were
   captured and fitted with radiotransmitters in south Louisiana and the
   delta region of Mississippi during the winter and early spring of
   1994-1997. The pelicans were monitored to determine their daily activity
   budgets while using different habitats such as catfish ponds, crawfish
   ponds, rivers. lakes, and bayous. Pelicans foraging at catfish ponds
   spent about 4\% of their day foraging and 96\% loafing, while pelicans
   foraging in other habitats spent about 28\% of their day foraging and
   72\% loafing. Fur all individual bird, the mean number of foraging
   sessions per day was 2.5 (+/-0.53 SE) and the mean length of each
   foraging session was 66.7 min. (+/-8.08 SE). Aerial censuses were also
   conducted to determine the numbers of pelicans in the delta region of
   Mississippi. Each rear the numbers of pelicans wintering in the delta
   region of Mississippi peaked in February and March, corresponding with
   spring migration. Pelican numbers reached approximately 4,600 during
   February and March 1996. Pelicans were observed foraging in larger
   flocks for shorter periods of time on catfish ponds than in other
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of environmental contaminants in air, water and food may
   pose significant health risks to the exposed human population. However,
   problems associated with assessing chronic exposure to low doses of
   environmental chemicals, multiple exposure routes, diseases with long
   latency periods, and non-specific health outcomes make it difficult to
   conduct the appropriate human epidemiologic studies. It may be useful to
   complement human epidemiology with animal studies. Animals monitored or
   evaluated in situ for the appropriate suite of endpoints can provide
   information about both exposure levels and potential adverse health
   effects. Animals have served as sentinel indicators for health effects
   associated with a number of environmental exposures, including
   pesticides and asbestos. Pet dogs may be particularly valuable sentinels
   because they share the human environment. In addition, dogs respond to
   many toxic insults in ways analogous to humans, they have
   physiologically compressed life spans, and they are free from some
   important lifestyle risk factors for disease. An example of how pet dogs
   may be used as sentinels for potential human health hazards involves a
   study of the genotoxic effects resulting from exposure to a mixture of
   chemicals from nearby Superfund sites. We conducted a cross-sectional
   study of exposed dogs (living in the community with the Superfund sites)
   and controls (living in a nearby community). The pet owners completed a
   questionnaire, and we collected a blood sample from each dog. The blood
   samples were analyzed for standard clinical parameters and assays for
   possible genotoxic effects (peripheral blood lymphocyte micronucleus
   frequency and lymphocyte subtyping). Pet dogs living near the Superfund
   sites had a higher micronucleus frequency than control animals,
   suggesting that the dogs may have been exposed to environmental
   contaminants from these sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B,V, All rights

Abstract = {{The Department of Defense (DoD) has a unique marine mammal program
   maintained by the US Navy that includes the largest force of bottlenose
   dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, worldwide. In recent years, this
   population of cetaceans that lives in netted open water enclosures in
   San Diego Bay has been monitored for levels of organochlorine (OC)
   contaminants in blubber, blood and milk. Data generated from these
   studies have afforded insight into the fate and possible effects of OC
   contaminants in marine mammals. We now report preliminary findings on
   the effects of maternal OC exposure on pregnancy outcome. Blubber OC
   levels were compared between females whose calves survived beyond 6
   months and females whose calves were stillborn or died within 12 days of
   birth. The mean concentration of Sigma DDT was more than 3 times as high
   among dolphins whose calves died as that among dolphins whose calves
   survived beyond 6 months (P = 0.002). Mean Sigma PCB was more than 2.5
   times higher in females whose calves did not survive (P = 0.076). This
   population is a logical sentinel for the assessment of environmentally
   mediated disease. Biological tissues and fluids can be sampled on a
   regular basis from the dolphins for accumulation of tissue residues,
   facilitated by conditioned husbandry behaviors. These trained behaviors
   help preclude possible alterations in health measures resulting from
   capture stress. Animals' diets can be monitored for contaminant levels.
   With these data, the expertise and facilities available at the Navy
   laboratory and in collaboration with other experts in the field,
   controlled studies can be designed to monitor and assess dietary
   exposure, measurable immune and neurologic responses and assess
   reproductive and transgenerational effects of contaminants. Biomarkers
   can be developed to relate the health of individual animals relative to
   contaminant exposures. Such investigations of natural exposure and
   response scenarios are a logical adjunct to traditional laboratory
   toxicity studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of
   Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR 1993), the dose due to the inhalation of radon
   decay products represents almost 50\% of the total natural radiation
   dose to the general population. The scientific community is interested
   in the assessment of the risk induced by domestic radon exposure. The
   dosimetric models used to estimate the dose are very sensitive to
   unattached fraction and size distributions, which makes the
   characterization of the indoor radon decay products aerosol necessary.
   For this purpose, longterm measurements of unattached fraction (f(p))
   and equilibrium factor (F) were taken in a dwelling under typical indoor
   domestic aerosol conditions. An original device consisting of an annular
   diffusion channel set in parallel with an open filter was developed and
   calibrated to continuously measure the unattached fraction. Moreover,
   radon activity concentration and particle concentration were
   simultaneously monitored. With aged aerosol, particle concentration was
   found to be very low (between 500 and 5000 cm(-3)), radon activity
   concentration ranged from 240 to 2800 Bq m(-3), and the mean values of
   f(p) and F were, respectively, 0.31 (0.08-0.67) and 0.16 (0.04-0.45).
   With aerosol sources, the high increase in particle concentration led to
   a negligible unattached fraction and raised the equilibrium factor. A
   correlation relationship was determined between these two parameters
   under different aerosol conditions. Finally, our experimental results
   were compared to results obtained with the PRADDO model; this comparison
   showed a good agreement between these two different approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The notion that females prefer to visit and mate with grouped over
   solitary males is an oft-advanced hypothesis for the evolution of lek
   behaviour. A corollary of this hypothesis is that per capita mating
   success of males increases with increasing lek size. Few field studies
   have tested this prediction via experimental manipulation of lek size.
   Here, I describe field studies that monitored female visits to
   artificially created leks of varying size in two species of tephritid
   fruit flies, the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, and the
   Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. No support for the female
   preference hypothesis was detected for B. dorsalis. However, in C.
   capitata, mean ratios of female sightings:signalling males were
   significantly greater for leks containing 18 or 36 males than leks that
   contained only six males. The observation that C. capitata males in
   natural populations typically form small leks suggests that a
   female-male conflict exists regarding optimal lek size.}},

Abstract = {{I investigated the short-term regulation of parental provisioning rate
   in blue tits by videotaping the parents at the nest. An additional
   feeding experiment allowed a comparison between the behaviour of parents
   rearing their brood under normal and supplemented feeding conditions.
   Videotaping revealed that parents changed their provisioning rate as an
   immediate response to the absence of begging by chicks. When chicks did
   not beg for food, the parents solicited them with a particular call to
   make them open their beaks. Parents spent significantly longer away from
   the nest immediately after uttering these feeding calls. Provisioning
   rate returned to the usual levels as soon as the chicks started begging
   again, but supplemented parents took less time to do so than controls
   (i.e. parents not provided with additional food). Changes in
   provisioning rate had effects on both the type and size of prey brought
   to the brood. Females often responded to low brood demand by returning
   to the nest without food. Food-supplemented parents, but not controls,
   took larger larvae when they stayed away from the nest for longer. This
   suggests that parents in the supplemented group could use more time to
   reach good feeding sites or, more probably, increase their prey
   selectivity. Blue tits continually monitored the begging behaviour of
   their offspring and responded accordingly by adjusting their feeding
   rate, with immediate consequences for prey choice. (C) 2001 The

Abstract = {{The declining size of the Baltimore Harbor black-crowned night-heron
   (Nycticorax nycticorax) colony has been hypothesized to be linked to
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure. In 1998, a ``sample egg{''} was
   collected from 65 black-crowned night-heron nests (each containing
   greater than or equal to three eggs) for contaminant analysis, and the
   remaining eggs in these 65 nests, plus four two-egg nests, were
   monitored for hatching and hedging success. Eggs were also collected
   from 12 nests at Holland Island, a reference site in southern Chesapeake
   Bay. Samples were analyzed for 26 organochlorine pesticides and
   metabolities and 145 PCB congeners. Pesticide and metabolite
   concentrations, including p,p'-DDE, were well below thresholds
   associated with adverse reproductive effects at both sites. Average
   concentration of total PCBs, 12 Ah receptor-active PCB congeners, and
   toxic equivalents in eggs from Baltimore Harbor were greater (up to
   35-fold) than that observed in Holland Island samples. Overall nest
   success at the Baltimore Harbor heronry was estimated by the Mayfield
   method to be 0.74, and the mean number of young fledged/hen was 2.05,
   which is within published productivity estimates for maintaining a
   stable black-crowned night-heron population. Using logistic regression,
   no significant relationships were found between organochlorine
   contaminant concentrations in sample eggs and hatching, fledging, or
   overall reproductive success. Processes other than poor reproduction
   (e.g., low postfledging survival, emigration, habitat degradation) may
   be responsible for the declining size of the Baltimore Harbor colony.}},

Abstract = {{In epidemiological studies, investigators have routinely used ambient
   air concentrations, measured by air-quality monitoring networks, to
   assess exposure of subjects. When there is great spatial variability of
   ambient air concentrations or when there are specific indoor exposures,
   this approach may yield substantial exposure misclassification and
   distort the associations between exposure and the health endpoints of
   interest. In 3 French metropolitan areas, the cross-sectional
   relationships between 48 hr of nitrogen dioxide personal exposure of 73
   children and the corresponding 48-hr background ambient air
   concentrations were analyzed. The crude correlation between ambient air
   concentrations and personal exposures was poor in all cities (r(2) -.009
   for Grenoble, r(2) =.04 for Toulouse, and r(2) =.02 for Paris). These
   correlations were improved when the authors took into account other
   ambient air or indoor air sources of nitrogen dioxide emissions (the
   corresponding multiple linear regression, r(2), increased to .43 in
   Grenoble, .50 in Toulouse, and .37 in Paris). The main variables that
   explained personal exposures were an index of traffic intensity and
   proximity and use of a gas cooker at home. The results of this study
   confirm that ambient air-monitoring site measurements are poor
   predictors of personal exposure. Investigators should carefully
   characterize the proximity of roads occupied by dense traffic to the
   home/school as well as indoor sources of nitric oxide emissions; both of
   these careful characterizations will assist researchers in the
   prediction of personal exposure in epidemiological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Many European countries have annual breeding bird monitoring schemes
   based on nationwide samples; most are in northern and western Europe. We
   have developed a method to produce yearly population indices of bird
   species across countries by combining the results of existing national
   schemes. The method takes into account the differences in population
   sizes per country, as well as the differences in field methods, and the
   numbers of sites and years covered by the national schemes. In order to
   test the method, we collected raw data from a number of countries and
   applied an index method to produce scheme results per country. Data were
   collected for five farmland species (Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, Linnet
   Carduelis cannabina, Skylark Alauda arvensis, Whitethroat Sylvia
   communis and Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella), from seven countries
   (UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Latvia and Estonia) for a
   20-year period (1978-97). The trial demonstrated that it was possible to
   combine national indices to provide supra-national yearly totals and
   their standard errors; the results were similar to those produced when
   the raw data were used. Thus, yearly European indices can be produced by
   exchanging only limited amounts of information, that is the national
   yearly indices of each species or, preferably the yearly population
   numbers and their standard errors. At a European scale, the populations
   of the five species selected have changed considerably. In western
   Europe (UK, Netherlands, Denmark and former West Germany combined),
   Linnet, Skylark and Yellowhammer have declined and Whitethroat has
   increased. Most changes occurred during the first ten-year period
   (2978-88). The changes in eastern Europe (the remaining countries) were
   less clear, in part because the statistical power of the national
   schemes is as yet limited.}},

Abstract = {{Eastern Pacific coral reefs have been severely disturbed by natural
   events during the past two decades. We have monitored changes in reef
   structure and reef recovery after ENSO 1982-83 (starting in 1984), at
   sixteen permanent plots in four different habitats at Ca (n) over tildeo
   Island, Costa Rica. Reefs were also severely affected by dinoflagellate
   blooms in 1985, and by warming events in 1987, 1990-95 and 1997-98. The
   1982-83 event caused approximately 100\% coral mortality in shallow reef
   zones at Ca (n) over tildeo Island, particularly of pocilloporid
   species. Coral recruitment may have coincided with putative larval
   pulses during the various ENSO events or shortly after, as deduced by
   the presence of sexual recruits during 1987-88 and widespread sexual
   recruitment in 1993-94. Mortality of juvenile and adult colonies during
   the 1997-98 ENSO warming was low (5\%), suggesting that populations of
   massive and branching corals may have been more tolerant of elevated
   thermal stress than during previous events. Supporting this notion are
   the Reynolds SST comparative plots for 1982-83 and 1997-98, which
   indicate similar warming trends and temperature maxima at this locality.
   Reefs at Ca (n) over tildeo Island are recovering, with significant
   increases in the number of now sexual recruits. Although 1984 levels of
   coral cover have not yet been attained island-wide, 70\% cover occurs in
   reef areas on the north side of the island. Other disturbances, such as
   phytoplankton blooms that affected Pocillopora spp. in all habitats, may
   have retarded reef regeneration, complicating the course of recovery
   after the 1982-83 ENSO warming disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{An exposure risk assessment of workers in a refinery production unit was
   undertaken. Gasoline and its main components were investigated through
   environmental and biological monitoring. Measured variables were
   environmental benzene, toluene, pentane and hexane; benzene and toluene
   in blood and urine; tt-MA (metabolite of benzene) in urine. Multivariate
   statistical analysis of the data showed that worker's exposure to the
   above substances fell within the limits specified by organisations such
   as ACGIH. Also, biological values complied with reference values (RV)
   for non-occupationally-exposed population. Different values of
   biological variables were determined by separating smokers from
   non-smokers: smokers had hematic and urinary benzene values
   significantly higher than non-smokers. During a 3-yr sampling, it was
   possible to identify a significant decrease of benzene in the workplace
   air and of hematic benzene for non-smokers. The most exposed department,
   one in which tank-lorries were loaded, needs further investigation and
   extended monitoring. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gaschromatography was used to establish the presence of quantifiable
   residues of 14 persistent chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutants in whole
   blood, clotted blood, heart, kidney, liver and muscle samples obtained
   from individual African whitebacked (Pseudogyps africanus), Cape griffon
   (Gyps coprotheres) and Lappetfaced (Torgos tracheliotos) vultures from
   different localities in South Africa. The levels of pesticides measured
   in whole blood samples of live specimens were compared between nestlings
   from two natural breeding colonies, adults from a wildlife area and
   birds held in captivity. Statistically significant (P < 0.05)
   differences between populations were detected in geometric means
   calculated for gamma -BHC (lindane), alpha (cis)-chlordane and alpha
   -endosulfan, Five of the organochlorine contaminants displayed
   significant variations between concentrations detected in the clotted
   blood, organs and muscles excised from vulture carcasses. This includes
   residues of gamma -BHC, alpha -chlordane, dieldrin, beta -endosulfan and
   heptachlor epoxide, Values of the respective biocides measured in
   vulture samples were generally low in comparison to results documented
   for a number of avian species. Although no threat is posed by any of the
   organochloride pesticides, continual monitoring of especially breeding
   colonies is recommended. Furthermore, the suitability of African
   whitebacked vulture nestlings as basic bioindicators is highly
   advocated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Animal care in the third millennium will require a melding of scientific
   and humane interests to achieve optimal care of genetically engineered
   mice and to expedite scientific and medical advances by using these
   mammals. Undoubtedly, rodent patients present certain difficulties for
   those who wish to assess their daily well-being and to contribute to
   efficient and successful scientific discovery. High-density housing,
   large experimental groups, and low-lux room lighting makes the
   application of large-animal care standards to rodents seem daunting to
   researchers and veterinary care programs. In addition, great variability
   in training and experience among those responsible for the direct
   application of humane care to rodents exists. Most of the direct animal
   care in small animal facilities occurs in decentralized locales by
   personnel who have completed obligatory but relatively minimal animal
   care training. Examples of personnel in this category include
   postdoctoral fellows, junior-level scientists, summer students, and
   assistant laboratory animal technologists. Some programs even use the
   husbandry staff to perform health checks of high-risk populations on a
   daily basis. For this reason, the extrapolation of performance-based
   intervention in rodent care is difficult to apply practically. Early
   efforts to enhance humane outcome in rodents have been published by
   scientists and veterinarians and are largely directed at singular
   endpoints, such as weight loss and declining temperatures, in specific
   models. Scientists often are reluctant to accept such standards because
   of concern about premature intervention or variability between scorers
   and to reservations regarding a lack of procedural likeness with their
   proposed study. This paper highlights a digital method for melding
   current advanced animal scoring standards using palm pilot user-friendly
   methods that account for composite weight scoring, behavioral or
   physiologic attributes, and interventions. Information is rapidly
   downloaded and results in quick storage of large rodent population
   monitoring. This minimizes interpretative variability between caregivers
   and greater standardization of procedures. These considerations
   facilitate the rapid diagnosis of outliers and make possible
   intervention that streamlines the delivery of humane care to large
   experimental populations.}},

Title = {{A latitudinal gradient in recruitment of intertidal invertebrates in the
   northeast Pacific Ocean}},

Abstract = {{Rates of propagule supply can be important determinants of spatial and
   temporal patterns in community structure. In the northeast Pacific
   Ocean. large-scale differences in the structure of intertidal
   invertebrate communities have been attributed to a latitudinal gradient
   in recruitment in this region. To determine whether such a gradient
   exists, recruitment of intertidal barnacles and mussels was monitored at
   17 sites across this region in 1996 and 1997. A latitudinal gradient in
   recruitment was detected in this study. This gradient was approximately
   a stepcline: annual recruitment, on average, was 1-2 orders of magnitude
   higher in central and northern Oregon than in central and northern
   California. In contrast to the regional differences, large-scale
   gradients in recruitment within California were small; correlations of
   recruitment with latitude were weak, and in all but one case,
   statistically insignificant. Nonetheless, trends in the data suggest
   that recruitment within central and northern California was highest
   between San Francisco and Monterey Bay, where larvae may be retained
   more nearshore than to the north or south. If so, apparently conflicting
   claims about latitudinal gradients in recruitment within California can
   be reconciled. The large-scale transition in recruitment rates supports
   the hypothesis that a marked shift in the intensity of upwelling near
   Cape Blanco in southern Oregon is a major cause of a coincident
   transition in community structure. Stronger upwelling (and thus offshore
   flow) to the south has been hypothesized to transport larvae further
   offshore and thereby reduce larval supply to nearshore benthic
   communities.
   This study confirms that the predicted differences in recruitment exist,
   and that these differences are large. Preliminary calculations indicate
   that regional differences in offshore flow are likely to make a larger
   contribution to the recruitment transitions than several other plausible
   causes. In addition, recruitment transitions are larger, more abrupt,
   and more consistent across species than corresponding shifts in
   percentage cover, which favor competitive dominants. This supports model
   predictions that competition for space is more intense where recruitment
   is high. However, the absence of strong, large-scale recruitment
   gradients within California suggests that mesoscale processes are
   relatively more important than latitudinal trends in upwelling as
   determinants of community structure patterns at smaller scales.}},

Abstract = {{The study was designed to determine seasonal differences in personal
   exposures to respirable suspended particles (RSP) and environmental
   tobacco smoke (ETS) for nonsmokers in Bremen, Germany. The subjects were
   office workers, either living and working in smoking locations or living
   and working in nonsmoking locations. One hundred and twenty four
   randomly selected nonsmoking subjects collected air samples close to
   their breathing zone by wearing personal monitors for 24 h or, in some
   cases, for 7-day periods during the winter of 1999. The investigation
   was repeated in the summer with 126 subjects, comprised of as many of
   the studied winter population (89 subjects) as possible. Saliva cotinine
   analyses were undertaken to verify the nonsmoking status of the
   subjects. Subjects wore one personal monitor while at work and one while
   away from the workplace on weekdays, and a third monitor at the weekend.
   Collected air samples were analysed for RSP, nicotine, 3-ethenylpyridine
   (3-EP) and ETS particles. The latter were estimated using ultraviolet
   absorbance (UVPM), fluorescence (FPM) and solanesol (SolPM)
   measurements. ETS exposure was consistently higher in the winter than in
   the summer, this pattern being particularly evident for subjects both
   living and working with smokers. The highest median 24-h time weighted
   average (TWA) concentrations of ETS particles (SolPM, 25 mug m(-3)) and
   nicotine (1.3 mug m-3) were recorded for subjects performing weekday
   monitoring during the winter. These were significantly higher than
   equivalent levels of ETS particles (SolPM, 2.4 mug m(-3)) and nicotine
   (0.26 mug m(-3)) determined during the summer. There were no appreciable
   differences between winter and summer percent workplace contributions to
   median TWA ETS particle and nicotine weekday concentrations, the
   workplace in Bremen, in general, contributing between 35\% and 61\% of
   reported median concentrations. Workers, on average, spent one-third of
   their time at work during a weekday, indicating that concentrations were
   either comparable or higher in the workplace than in the home and other
   locations outside the workplace. Median 24-h weekend ETS particle and
   nicotine concentrations for smoking locations were not significantly
   different from equivalent weekday levels during the winter, but were
   significantly lower during the summer. Based upon median 24-h TWA SolPM
   and nicotine concentrations for the winter, extrapolated to 1 year's ETS
   exposure, those subjects both living and working in smoking locations
   (the most highly exposed group) would potentially inhale 13 cigarette
   equivalents/year (CEs/y). However, based on a similar extrapolation of
   summer measurements, the same group of subjects would potentially inhale
   between 1.3 and 1.9 CEs/y. The most highly exposed subjects in this
   study, based upon 90th percentile concentrations for those both living
   and working in smoking locations during the winter, would potentially
   inhale up to 67 CEs/y in the winter and up to 22 CEs/y in the summer.
   This clearly demonstrates that seasonal effects should be taken into
   account in the design and interpretation of ETS exposure studies. Air
   sampling over a 7-day period was shown to be technically feasible, and
   subsequent RSP, ETS particle and nicotine levels determined by 7-day
   monitoring were not found to be significantly different from equivalent
   levels determined by 24-h monitoring.
   However, the longer sampling period resulted in the collection of an
   increased quantity of analytes, which improved the limits of
   quantitation (LOQ) and allowed a more accurate determination of low
   level ETS exposure. This was reflected by a reduced percentage of data
   falling below the LOQ for 7-day monitoring compared with 24-h
   monitoring. The use of a liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass
   spectrometric detection for saliva cotinine measurement afforded a
   greatly improved LOQ and greater accuracy at low concentrations compared
   with the radioimmunoassay (RIA) method used in previous studies by these
   authors. In this study, 17 subjects out of 180 tested (9.4\%) were found
   to have saliva cotinine levels exceeding the selected threshold of 25 ng
   ml(-1) used to discriminate between smokers and nonsmokers. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{To ascertain solid tumor mortality in towns near Spain's four nuclear
   power plants and four nuclear fuel facilities from 1975 to 1993, we
   conducted a mortality study based on 12,245 cancer deaths in 283 towns
   situated within a 30-km radius of the above installations. As nonexposed
   areas, we used 275 towns lying within a 50- to 100-km radius of each
   installation, matched by population size and sociodemographic
   characteristics (income level, proportion of active population engaged
   in farming, proportion of unemployed, percentage of illiteracy, and
   province). Using log-linear models, we examined relative risk for each
   area and trends in risk with increasing proximity to an installation.
   The results reveal a pattern of solid-tumor mortality in the vicinity of
   uranium cycle facilities, basically characterized by excess lung
   {[}relative risk (RR) 1.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.25]
   and renal cancer mortality (RR 1.37, 95\% Cl, 1.07-1.76). Besides the
   effects of natural radiation, these results could well be evincing the
   influence on public health exerted by the environmental impact of
   mining. No such well-defined pattern appeared in the vicinity of nuclear
   power plants. Monitoring of cancer incidence and mortality is
   recommended in areas surrounding nuclear fuel facilities and nuclear
   power plants, and more specific studies are called for in areas adjacent
   to installations that have been fully operational: for longer periods.
   In this regard, it is important to use dosimetric information in all
   future studies.}},

   as well as in Seoul. The observations have been analyzed using
   diagnostics of climate change in Northeast Asia and also have been

   good statistic agreement with the NOAA/Climate Monitoring and

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted in the southwestern Gulf of St, Lawrence from
   1988 to 1993 to: (1) evaluate the catch performance of three types of
   conventional commercial snow crab traps: (2) evaluate the catch rates of
   soft-shelled crabs in normal and modified conical traps: and (3)
   investigate ghost fishing by lost traps. Our results showed that
   pyramidal and conical traps captured larger-sized males than
   conventional rectangular traps. Pyramidal traps also obtained
   significantly higher catch rates of commercial male crabs than
   conventional rectangular traps. The recent increased use of conical and
   pyramidal traps may result in a considerable reduction of the most
   reproductively important component of the male population. Close
   monitoring of the population reproductive potential is necessary to
   ensure a healthy population in the long-term. Our experimental conical
   traps, modified by attaching a 18 or 24 cm plastic panel around the top,
   caught significantly less soft-shelled crabs while maintaining the same
   catch rate of commercial crabs as compared to the conventional conical
   trap. This modified trap will play an important role in avoiding
   unnecessary mortality of crabs and ensuring the long-term conservation
   of the stock. Results from the ghost fishing experiment suggested that
   baited snow crab traps set in summer captured snow crab to their
   saturation level. The number of crabs then slowly decreased due to

Abstract = {{Syntopic Alouatta seniculus, Ateles chamek and Lagothrix cana (Atelidae)
   were studied in southwestern Amazonia. Primate populations were first
   surveyed, and then the party size, diet and vertical spacing were
   monitored over a 5-month period. Atelids accounted for more than half
   the survey sightings and Lagothrix was the most abundant. Party sizes
   recorded for both Alouatta and Lagothrix during monitoring were
   significantly larger than those recorded during surveys, but no such
   difference was found for Ateles. Monitored parties were significantly
   larger in Lagothrix in comparison with either Alouatta or Ateles, as
   were groups of Ateles in comparison with Alouatta. Mean party size in
   Ateles decreased progressively during the course of the study, from 8.9
   +/- 3.4 in June to 3.9 +/- 2.3 in October. Moraceae was the most
   important dietary resource for Ateles and Lagothrix, in terms of both
   feeding records and number of species exploited. There was considerable
   overlap in the plant taxa exploited, but some notable differences, such
   as the exclusive use of Hymenaea courbaril (Caesalpinaceae) by Lagothrix
   and of Euterpe precatoria (Arecaceae) by Ateles. As at other sites in
   the region, Ateles, occupied significantly higher forest strata in
   comparison with Lagothrix. Despite the preliminary nature of the study,
   the results indicate a number of ecological differences between species
   that undoubtedly play an important role in niche separation. Copyright

Abstract = {{The population of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) in the
   forest of Rold Skov was monitored in the years following a 1981 gale.
   All attacked standing trees, areas with windthrown trees, catches in
   pheromone traps, timing of salvage harvests, and stands exposed to
   attack were registered and mapped in 1982 and 1983. Three different
   indices for attack density in areas around windthrown trees. infested
   trees and pheromone traps were calculated using GIS (ArcView). The
   attack densities in 1983 around areas with windthrown trees salvaged
   after 1 July 1982 were significantly higher than for areas salvaged
   earlier. Attack densities around windthrown trees salvaged between 15
   May and 1 July, just after the main spring flight period. were the
   lowest. The maximum distance from an old attack to a new was 650 m and
   there was an old attack within 500 m of all new attacks. Attack
   densities around pheromone traps were not correlated with the number of
   beetles caught in the traps. The majority of the beetles emerging from
   an epidemic attack dispersed over short distances (i.e. < 500 m) before
   entering a new host. This local dispersal may best be countered by
   removing old breeding sites/windthrown trees in the period between
   spring-flight and the emergence of the new generation, i.e. by using the
   windthrown trees as bait trees. Pheromone traps are not suitable as a
   sole protective measure to prevent further infestation. (C) 2001

   the single exception being the third generation of H. virescens
   collected from the Mississippi Delta. The small changes in tolerance in

Abstract = {{Residents' perceptions of water quality change following remediation
   work in the upper Pymme's Brook catchment (north London) were elicited
   by questionnaire and compared with monitored changes in Escherichia coli
   count and BMWP (The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP)) score.
   The wider usefulness of consumer perception surveys was then discussed.
   Monthly data collected between 1990 and 1996 shows that both E. coli
   count and BMWP score improved following flushing of the foul sewerage
   system in 1992, but that only E, coli count improved following the
   subsequent completion of large-scale remedial engineering works. Local
   residents were surveyed regarding their awareness of the scheme, and the
   causes of pollution, together with their perceptions as to the effects
   of the engineering works and of the resulting water quality
   improvements. Most respondents selected and ranked indicators in a way
   that suggested they had an awareness of the significance of various
   indicators of pollution severity. Following completion of the
   remediation scheme, residents perceived the watercourse to contain less
   rubbish and sewage fungus, and to have an improved colour and smell,
   which corresponds favourably to the monitored improvements. However,
   respondents' perceptions were found to vary when the study population
   was sub-divided using a range of parameters. For instance, frequent
   observers of the brook were most likely to correctly identify sewage as
   the main form of pollution. These divergent perceptions suggest that
   there may be considerable difficulties when perception surveys are used
   to quantify `benefits' following environmental improvement programmes.
   Nevertheless, the survey was clearly beneficial in enhancing residents'
   awareness of their environment and the role of their voice in its
   management. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Adult insects entering 34 bins (36-238 t capacity) storing newly
   harvested hard red winter wheat on 12 farms in Kansas were sampled from
   July through December 1998 using ventilation traps. Insects moving
   through the grain stored in these bins were sampled using probe traps.
   During the fourth week of storage, probe traps captured Cryptolestes
   ferrugineus in all bins, Ahasverus advena in 32 bins, Typhaea stercorea
   in 31 bins, and Rhyzopertha dominica in 13 bins. Means +/- SE of 5.6 +/-
   0.7 C. ferrugineus, 0.5 +/- 0.2 R. dominica, 3.5 +/- 0.3 A. advena, and
   3.5 +/- 0.7 T. stercorea were caught per day in probe traps. Ventilation
   traps provided a more direct measure than probe traps of the total
   numbers of insects entering bins storing newly harvested wheat.
   Immigration of A. advena and T. stercorea increased more than that of
   other species during the storage period, exceeding that of C.
   ferrugineus and R. dominica during some weeks. Rhyzopertha dominica had
   the lowest immigration rate. Bin size did not influence ventilation trap
   catch but as many as a third more insects may immigrate into large bins
   at the eaves compared with small bins because of their larger
   circumference. The mean numbers of C. ferrugineus, R. dominica, A.
   advena and T. stercorea captured in ventilation traps at the bin cap
   were 7.8, 2.7, 15.1 and 18.3 times, respectively, those captured in
   ventilation traps at the bin eaves. The estimated means +/- SE for total
   numbers of insects entering a bin each day were 13.6 +/- 4.2 C.
   ferrugineus, 6.3 +/- 4.7 R. dominica, 5.8 +/- 1.4 A. advena, and 21.9
   +/- 8.2 T. stercorea. Estimates of immigration rates can improve the
   accuracy with which insect densities are predicted using insect
   population growth models, and allow computer models to be used more
   effectively in managing insect pests. Insect infestations may be reduced
   by screening the openings between the bin cap and the roof, or the roof
   and the side walls. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Predation by coyotes (Canis latrans) on domestic sheep is a problem for
   many livestock producers throughout the United States Intermountain
   West. We examined whether surgical sterilization of coyote packs would
   modify their predatory behavior and reduce predation rates on domestic
   sheep as compared to coyote packs with pups. From June 1997 to December
   1997, we gathered baseline information on coyote pack size and
   movements. In winter 1998, we surgically sterilized and radiocollared
   members of 5 coyote packs. We also captured and radiocollared members of
   6 packs that remained intact (i.e., reproductive). During summer 1998,
   only 1 sterile pack killed a lamb, while 3 intact packs killed 11 lambs.
   When only sheep-killing packs were included, sterile packs killed an
   average of 0.35 lambs/week, while intact packs killed 1.53 lambs/week in
   1998. During winter 1999, we monitored 4 sterile and 8 intact packs. In
   summer 1999, 3 sterile packs killed 3 lambs, while 4 intact packs killed
   22 lambs. Considering only sheep-killing packs, sterile packs killed on
   average 0.38 lambs/week, while intact packs killed an average of 2.95
   lambs/week in 1999. Coyotes were more likely to kill lambs that were on
   the edges of coyote territories as compared to core areas. Lambs of less
   than average weight were also more likely to be killed by coyotes. The
   available rodent biomass in each territory was not an influence on the
   differential kill rates exhibited between sterile and intact packs, nor
   did the amount of available alternate prey influence annual coyote
   predation rates on sheep. We conclude that we could use surgical
   sterilization to modify the predatory behavior of coyotes associated
   with pup production and provisioning of pups. Sterilization successfully
   reduced, but did not eliminate, coyote predation on domestic sheep. The
   amount of losses averted in the first year exceeded the costs associated
   with surgically sterilizing a coyote pack, which indicates that surgical
   sterilization could prove beneficial on small-scale livestock
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the degree to which field observers can meet the assumptions
   underlying line transect sampling to monitor populations of desert
   tortoises (Gopherus agassizii). We present the results of 2 field trials
   using artificial tortoise models in 3 size classes. The trials were
   conducted on 2 occasions on an area south of Las Vegas, Nevada, where
   the density of the test population was known. In the first trials,
   conducted largely by experienced biologists who had been involved in
   tortoise surveys for many years, the density of adult tortoise models
   was well estimated (-3.9\% bias),while the bias was higher (-20\%) for
   subadult tortoise models. The bias for combined data was -12.0\%. The
   bias was largely attributed to the failure to detect all tortoise models
   on or near the that first centerline. The second trials were conducted
   with a group of largely inexperienced student volunteers and used
   somewhat different searching methods, and the results were similar to
   the first trials. Estimated combined density of subadult and adult
   tortoise models had a negative bias (-7.3\%), again attributable to
   failure to detect some models on or near the centerline. Experience in
   desert tortoise biology, either comparing the first and second trials or
   in the second trial with 2 experienced biologists versus 16 novices, did
   not have an apparent effect on the quality of the data or the accuracy
   of the estimates. Observer training, specific to line transect sampling,
   and field testing are important components of a reliable survey. Line
   transect sampling represents a viable method for large-scale monitoring
   of populations of desert tortoise; however, field protocol must be
   improved to assure the key assumptions are met.}},

Abstract = {{Bottle incubations, during which the activity and growth of prokaryotes
   is monitored during several days, are frequently carried out to study
   functional aspects of marine prokaryotic assemblages. These experiments
   will relate directly to in situ activities if all populations grow
   harmonically during the incubation. We tested whether this was the case
   by analyzing the composition of bacterial assemblages at the beginning
   and at the end of the incubation by denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis. Five experiments were done in different Antarctic
   regions. Bacterial assemblages north and south of the Polar Front were
   very different. In all cases, the final assemblages were very different
   from the initial ones, and these changes were often accompanied by a
   significant decrease of diversity indices. Our experiments included
   treatments with different temperature and organic matter amendments.
   Whereas the increase in temperature tested had a minor effect on
   prokaryotic growth rate and specific composition, the addition of
   organic matter strongly stimulated growth rate and selected a particular
   bacterial assemblage in some experiments but not in others. A
   significant component of bacterial assemblages From waters south of the
   Polar Front appeared to be Polari-bacter franzmannii, a gas vacuolated
   bacterium of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group that was
   originally isolated from Antarctic sea ice. This phylotype was enriched
   and dominated in almost all final assemblages. Our results indicate that
   long-term bottle incubations mostly measure the activity of a few
   opportunistic bacteria and not that of the original assemblage. This
   should be taken into account if data obtained in these experiments are
   used for balancing whole ecosystem carbon budgets and to derive
   biogeochemical conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{The number of seals on shore at Tugidak Island (Gulf of Alaska) declined
   72\%-85\% between 1976 and 1988 and increased during the 1990s. We
   compared pupping phenology and the ratio of pupping-period counts to
   molting-period counts between declining (1976-1979) and increasing
   (1994-1998) years, and examined the sex/age structure of seals ashore
   during the 1990s. In the 1970s the onset and peak of pupping occurred
   6-18 d later than in the 1990s. Rate of pup abandonment was higher in
   1978 than in the 1990s. Between 1994 and 1995, the maximum and mean
   number of seals ashore increased > 50\%, largely due to an increase in
   non-pups. From 1995 to 1998, the sex/age structure of seals ashore was
   similar among years. We observed three to four times as many seals
   during the molting period than during the pupping period in the 1970s,
   whereas similar numbers Mere ashore during these periods in the 1990s,
   perhaps reflecting changes in demography and/or haul-out behavior.
   Changes in pupping phenology and demography may reflect environmental
   changes, such as food availability, and when monitored in conjunction
   with population counts, may help us better interpret changes in the
   number of seals ashore.}},

Abstract = {{Lindera melissifolia {[}Walt] Blume (pondberry) is an endangered woody
   plant that grows in seasonally flooded wetlands and on the edges of
   sinks and ponds in six states of the southern United Stares: Arkansas,
   Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It
   is a stoloniferous, clonal shrub up to 2 m in height and is dioecious,
   with small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Information on its
   ecology and reproductive biology is sparse. The species has been
   affected by habitat destruction and alteration, especially timber
   cutting, clearing of land, and drainage or flooding of wetlands. Stem
   dieback was noted in populations in five states, but population,
   monitored fur three years do not appear to be declining. Three fungal
   pathogens were isolated from stems. Flowers covered with mesh bags
   produced no fruit, and flowers that received supplemental pollination
   did not set more fruit than open-pollinated flowers. Seed production was
   erratic in populations in Mississippi and Arkansas, and no seedlings
   were noted even after seed production was high. Individual ramets can be
   easily transplanted and multiply rapidly. Successful dispersal is very
   limited now due to restrictive land use in areas surrounding pondberry
   populations and to changes in hydrology. Introduction of plants to new
   areas may be necessary if the species is to recover.}},

Title = {{Assessing the risks of intervention: immobilization, radio-collaring and
   vaccination of African wild dogs}},
Journal = {{ORYX}},

Abstract = {{Controversy has surrounded the role of intervention in studies of
   African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Following the death or disappearance of
   all wild dogs under study in the Serengeti ecosystem, it was suggested
   that immobilization, radio-collaring or administration of rabies
   vaccines might have caused high mortality by compromising wild dogs'
   immune response to rabies virus. Planning future management and research
   on wild dogs and other species demands an assessment of the risks
   associated with such intervention. This paper critically reviews the
   available evidence and concludes that it is extremely unlikely that
   intervention contributed to the extinction of wild dogs in the Serengeti
   ecosystem. A more likely scenario is that vaccination failed to protect
   wild dogs exposed to rabies virus. Radio-collaring is an important
   component of wild dog research; hence, the benefits of immobilization
   appear to outweigh the risks, as long as (i) research is orientated
   towards wild dog conservation, (ii) radio-collaring is followed up by
   efficient monitoring, (iii) the number of animals immobilized is kept to
   the minimum necessary to maintain scientific rigour, and (iv) full data
   on disease and genetics are collected from all immobilized animals. By
   contrast, rabies vaccination currently seems to confer few benefits, at
   least when a single dose of vaccine is given. Further research, on
   captive animals, is in progress to establish more effective protocols,
   and to assess the role that vaccination might play in future management
   of wild dog populations.}},

Abstract = {{lndividual and population levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) often
   correlate positively with estimates of environmental and genetic stress.
   These relationships have promoted the widely-held belief that organisms
   with enhanced FA levels may act as sensitive biomonitors in natural
   populations under threat. However, a number of recent papers have
   challenged this concept by revealing major inconsistencies in the
   reported asymmetry-stress association. By reviewing published results
   from our study of patterns of bilateral trait asymmetry in seven Kenyan
   bird species, we test three hypotheses critical to the use of FA as
   stress monitor. Given the highly congruent findings across species and
   traits, we conclude that population FA-if accurately measured and
   analysed-can function as a valuable tool in conservation. We further
   discuss three potential causes for some of the inconsistencies reported
   in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents results of the recovery of bird populations in a
   logged compartment in Budongo Forest Reserve. Compartment W21 was first
   logged in 1963-64 and again in 1996-97. Between 1993-95 studies were
   conducted to establish the long-term effects of selective logging
   covering five compartments, including W21. A followup study in W21 alone
   was undertaken in April-September 1998. Data were collected using the
   same methods (point counts and mistnetting) used in 1993-95 to allow
   comparison of results for the two studies. The results showed that most
   forest specialist species were present in W21 after the 1996-97 logging,
   and there was no evidence of species loss as a result of logging.
   Assessment of species diversity by use of the logarithmic series showed
   that W21 was more diverse before the 1996-97 logging took place. There
   was a significant increase in abundance of birds after logging. All
   feeding guilds also showed significant increases, except for
   frugivore-insectivore and frugivore-granivore guilds. This study, where
   a logged compartment is monitored before and after logging, was the
   first of its kind in Uganda. It is hoped that the study will act as a
   model for long-term monitoring and future efforts should aim at
   detecting changes in the population, especially changes in abundance and
   feeding guilds.}},

Abstract = {{The Kilum-Ijim montane forest is effectively the last viable site for
   the Red Data Book species, Touraco bannermani. In 1987, BirdLife
   International began monitoring birds particularly Touraco bannermani in
   the area. During the three-year period 1995-1997 Tauraco bannermani were
   present at a mean density of 0.18 birds/ha in one montane forest
   habitat. Although a forest dependent species, it can survive in both
   degraded and relatively undisturbed forest habitats, migrating to higher
   altitudes during breeding and to lower altitudes out of the breeding
   season. This paper discusses these results and comments on the
   suitability of the species and other birds occupying a similar niche for
   monitoring forest condition and wider biodiversity values.}},

Abstract = {{Methyleugenol-baited traps are used for Oriental fruit by control
   through male annihilation, as well as for detection and monitoring of by
   populations. However, if the males which come to these traps emit sex
   pheromones, attract females from the surrounding vegetation, and mate
   with them before being killed, then using such traps might in fact
   increase levels of fruit infestation. In the present study, we monitored
   fly abundance in an experimental orchard before, during, and after
   methyleugenol-baited trap deployment. We also recorded the numbers of
   flies recruited to the trees with and without traps, and quantified
   their sexual activity. The males attracted by methyleugenol in our
   experiments fed on the poisoned baits almost immediately upon their
   arrival, and did not attempt to emit pheromones or attempt copulations
   before entering the traps. No changes in female abundance in the
   vicinity of deployed traps were recorded. Because of their high
   specificity, low cost, and environmental safety, methyleugenol baited
   traps might be a valuable tool for integrated management of Oriental
   fruit By populations.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in feeding activity, metabolic rate and major tissue
   energy concentrations of the infaunal bivalve Laternula elliptica were
   monitored over a 12 degrees month period in relation to phytoplankton
   standing stock. Chlorophyll a concentration displayed the prolonged
   winter minima and intense annual summer peak characteristic of polar
   environments. Divers made regular observations on the feeding activity
   of L. elliptica throughout the year, and siphons were completely
   withdrawn below the sediment surface at the start of the study in early
   September 1998. Siphons reappeared as chlorophyll concentrations rose at
   the end of September and these concentrations continued until late May
   1999 when siphons were again withdrawn. There were, therefore, around 4
   months in the austral winter when L. elliptica did not feed. Oxygen
   consumption rates were highly seasonal, varying from 4.3 mu mol h(-1)
   late in the winter (August 1999) to 12.9 mu mol h(-1) in summer (March
   1999) for a 50 degrees mm shell height individual, indicating a summer
   increase in oxygen consumption over winter levels of Hx3.0. Nitrogen was
   excreted as 90\% ammonium and 10\% urea, and excretion rates were also
   highly seasonal. The O:N ratio did not vary significantly with size in
   winter (September, August), but declined with shell length in summer
   (November, January and March), indicating that larger bivalves used a
   higher proportion of protein to fuel metabolism than younger animals
   when feeding in summer. O:N ratios in August 1999 ranged from 3 to 16,
   indicating a predominantly protein-based metabolism, ANCOVA showed that
   regressions of dry tissue masses of major non-re productive body
   components (musculature, ctenidia and digestive tissue) against shell
   height did not change between late winter and late summer. ANCOVA also
   showed that the regression slope for gonad mass against shell height was
   greater in late summer than late winter (slope F = 7.37, P = 0.009), and
   gonad mass was greater in all animals by late summer. Although tissue
   masses remained constant, energy content of non-reproductive tissues
   (especially musculature) declined from summer to winter. Muscle tissue
   also showed the greatest reduction in protein content, which was
   consistent with O:N estimates of primarily protein-based metabolism,
   especially in winter. Reduction in whole body energy content (5.84 kJ)
   agreed closely with total power utilisation during winter estimated from
   oxygen consumption (5.78 kJ). The data also showed that in contrast to
   temperate bivalve species, L. elliptica survives the prolonged polar
   winter with little reduction in body mass.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades of refinement and application of instream flow
   evaluations, we have examined the hydraulic habitat of aquatic
   macroinvertebrates in a variety of conditions, along with the role of
   these macroinvertebrates in sustaining ecosystem integrity. Instream
   flow analyses assume that predictable changes in channel flow
   characteristics can, in turn, be used to predict the change in the
   density or distribution of lotic species or, more appropriately, the
   availability of useable habitat for those species. Five major hydraulic
   conditions most affect the distribution and ecological success of lotic
   biota: suspended load, bedload movement, and water column effects, such
   as turbulence, velocity profile, and substratum interactions (near-bed
   hydraulics). The interactions of these hydraulic conditions upon the
   morphology and behavior of the individual organisms govern the
   distribution of aquatic biota. Historically, management decisions
   employing the Physical Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) have focused upon
   prediction of available habitat for life stages of target fish species.
   Regulatory agencies have rarely included evaluation of benthos for flow
   reservations. Although `taxonomic discomfort' may be cited for the
   reluctant use or creation of benthic criteria, we suggest that a basic
   misunderstanding of the links between benthic macroinvertebrate and the
   fish communities is still a problem. This is derived from the lack of a
   perceived `value' that can be assigned to macroinvertebrate species.
   With the exception of endangered mussel species (for which PHABSIM
   analysis is probably inappropriate), this is understandable. However, it
   appears that there is a greater ability to predict macroinvertebrate
   distribution (that is, a response to the change in habitat quality or
   location) and diversity without complex population models. Also, habitat
   suitability criteria for water quality indicator taxa (Ephemeroptera,
   Plecoptera, and Trichoptera; the so-called `EPTs') may also provide
   additional management options to stream regulators. The greatest
   application for macroinvertebrate criteria will be in low-order streams
   where a more immediate link to fish communities can be established. We
   present an example from Queens Creek, in North Carolina, USA, in which
   monthly allocations required to preserve the integrity of the benthic
   macroinvertebrate community were significantly higher than for the
   target benthic fish species, Cottus bairdi. In the months when both
   Cottus and community diversity of macroinvertebrates were the
   `bottleneck' life stages, preservation of only fish species could result
   in an additional 5-25\% loss in macroinvertebrate habitat. We suggest
   that, as there becomes an increased emphasis on maintaining
   macroinvertebrates as monitors of stream health, there will be a
   concurrent emphasis on incorporating hydraulic habitat conditions as a
   part of bioassessment. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Although paddlefish Polyodon spathula are protected in Wisconsin and
   Minnesota, limited information exists on the status of populations in
   the upper Mississippi River. Paddlefish populations in the upper
   Mississippi River probably have never fully recovered from declines that
   occurred in the late 1800s and early 1900s following habitat loss and
   extensive fishing. In our study, we estimated population size, size and
   age structure, and mortality for a paddlefish population in the
   Wisconsin River, a tributary of the upper Mississippi River, during 1993
   and 1994. We tagged 337 paddlefish and recaptured 33. Unequal
   probability of capture and small sample sizes violated the assumptions
   of published population models. To improve interpretation of results,
   data were adjusted for assumption violations, and estimates were
   generated using three widely used models (modified Jolly-Seber. adjusted
   Petersen, and Chapman's modified Schnabel). Based on Chapman's modified
   Schnabel adjusted for mortality and estimated ages of 5-23 years for all
   paddlefish sampled, we estimated the population to be 1.353 paddlefish.
   Eye-to-fork length for paddlefish ranged from 64 to 125 cm. Using
   catch-curve analysis, we estimated annual mortality to be 26.7\%. Size
   structure and age structure data indicated weak year-classes for the 4-6
   years preceding our sampling. Monitoring of the Wisconsin River
   paddlefish populations should continue because of the relatively high
   concentration of fish with the potential as a source population;
   investigations should also be implemented on other large tributaries and
   main stem of the upper Mississippi River.}},

Abstract = {{Many populations of anadromous herring, (e.g., alewives Alosa
   pseudoharengus and blueback herring A. aestivalis, collectively referred
   to as river herring) are in decline. To help understand the various
   processes influencing their relative abundance, we studied juvenile
   river herring populations in ii small, coastal Massachusetts systems. We
   examined diel and seasonal movements, variation in patterns of
   abundance, and relationships between juvenile river herring numbers and
   seven abiotic and biotic factors (stream discharge, pond temperature,
   habitat availability, pond transparency, pH, food availability, and
   spawning stock size). Seasonally, juvenile downstream migration peaked
   in early summer, and most juvenile river herring emigrated between 1200
   and 1600 hours. Little or no emigration occurred in late summer when
   stream channels were often dewatered, although several streams
   experienced a smaller, more variable emigration peak in the fall. In
   univariate regressions, stream discharge, pond volume, surface area,
   depth, transparency, and pH were significantly related to variation in
   juvenile abundance across systems. Multiple regression models that
   integrated discharge, volume, and transparency, as well as multivariate
   models that included abiotic and biotic influences, trophic effects, and
   system size, explained 32-82\% of the variability in juvenile abundance
   across systems. Thus, stream discharge, pond volume, transparency, pH,
   trophic effects, and system size contribute to heterogeneity across
   systems and may influence the abundance of these fish during freshwater
   residence. Increased understanding of the sources of heterogeneity in
   movement patterns and causes of variability in abundance across systems
   can help to implement more effective monitoring protocols, more informed
   land-use decisions. and improved management of river herring.}},

Abstract = {{We tested how depth and cobble clusters affected pool use by brown trout
   Salmo trutta in four enclosures in a seminatural, outdoor stream
   channel. Into each enclosure, which consisted of a shallow,
   cobble-filled habitat and a deeper pool, we stocked eight brown trout
   9-19 cm long that had been tagged with passive integrated transponders
   (PIT). Receiver antennae for the PIT tags were placed between the two
   habitats to allow continuous monitoring of movements of individual fish.
   We found that trout used pools to a greater extent at night than during
   the day. Alterations of depth and substrate had no effect on pool use at
   night. During the day. increasing water depth either alone or together
   with adding cobbles increased pool use, whereas cobble addition alone
   had no effect on pool use. We suggest that evaluations of physical
   habitat modifications: in streams should include measurements of
   population responses as well as information on how, when. and which fish
   use newly created habitat structures.}},

Abstract = {{Salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis Kroyer have caused disease problems
   in farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. since the mid-1970s in Norway.
   High infection intensities and premature return of wild sea trout Salmo
   trutta L, were first reported in 1992. Later emaciated wild Atlantic
   salmon smelts carrying large amounts of Lice have been observed both in
   fjords and offshore. The Norwegian Animal Health Authority regulations
   to control the problem, which came into operation in 1998, included
   compulsory louse level monitoring in farms and maximum legal numbers of
   lice per fish. Here, we present a model of salmon louse egg production
   in Norway and show that the effect of the current public management
   strategy is critically dependent on the yearly increase in salmon
   production. This is because the infection pressure is the product of the
   number of fish in the system, and the number of lice per fish. Due to
   the much larger number of farmed than wild salmonids, it is highly
   likely that lice originating from farmed salmon infect wild stock.
   Estimated tolerance Limits for wild salmonids vary widely, and the level
   of louse egg production in farms which would be neaded to decimate wild
   populations is not known. Two possible thresholds for total lice egg
   production are investigated: (1) 1986 to 1983 level (i.e, before adverse
   effects on sea trout were recorded), and (2) a level corresponding to a
   doubling of the estimated natural infection pressure. The farm lice per
   fish Limits that would have to be observed to keep louse production
   within the 2 thresholds are calculated for the period 1986 to 2005. A
   steady decrease in the permitted number of lice per fish may keep the
   total louse production stable, but the number of salmon required for
   verification of lice numbers will increase as the prevalence to be
   verified is decreased. At threshold (2), the model estimated that lice
   limits should have been 0.05 louse per fish in 1999. This would require
   60 fish from each pen to be collected, anaesthetised and examined for a
   good estimate at a confidence level of 95 \%. Such sample numbers are
   likely to be opposed by farmers. The use of national delousing programs
   to solve the problem is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Species of Botrychium reproduce by spores that form subterranean
   gametophytes and a few, like B. pumicola, also reproduce asexually with
   subterranean sporophytic gemmae. The goal of this study was to examine
   the genetic diversity of B, pumicola populations and to better
   understand the role of gemmae. Ninety-nine individuals from three
   monitored populations were sampled. The technique of inter-simple
   sequence repeats (ISSR) produced 15 polymorphic loci and identified 71
   ISSR genotypes. Sixteen of the ISSR genotypes were shared by more that
   one individual in a population, representing potential clones. Ten of
   the 16 shared genotypes were not limited to clusters of plants (groups
   of plants growing from the same point). The ten potential clones: were
   disjunct (separated by other genotypes) and not in patches as might be
   expected for an underground propagule. There is a high probability that
   these shared genotypes arose from independent sexual events suggesting
   they were not clones. These results suggest that the long-distance
   dispersal of gemmae is at best a rare event.}},

Abstract = {{Forestry practices and high rates of land clearance for agriculture are
   causing genetic erosion of valuable tree species in the Peruvian Amazon,
   thereby endangering the economic sustainability of rural communities and
   limiting Peru's opportunities for the development of new timber and
   non-timber forest products. The potential utility and limitations of six
   low-input interventions to help forestall further genetic erosion in the
   region are discussed, with a focus on local community involvement.
   Improved agroforestry systems may help reduce deforestation by
   increasing farm productivity, although methods to increase the currently
   low adoption rate of these technologies need to be developed. Use of
   strategic tree domestication techniques can also improve farm
   productivity and prevent inadvertent genetic drift and inbreeding
   associated with traditional domestication practices, although to have a
   major impact, current programs need to be extended across the region.
   Woodlot forestry could supplant selective extraction of timber and
   offers an attractive opportunity for poverty alleviation if appropriate
   credit and land tenure policies can be developed. However, it may also
   result in increased deforestation if activities on public land cannot be
   controlled. The implementation of improved seed collection systems and
   simple seed transfer guidelines would help to reduce the collection of
   seed of poor quality and low genetic diversity, and avoid maladapted
   plantings, although such programs are difficult to monitor and seed
   costs may increase. Strategic identification and design of in situ
   conservation areas would help to ensure the viability of conserved
   populations, but requires the forfeiture of significant revenue from
   timber concessions.}},

Abstract = {{Possible effects on wildlife of targets baited with an attractive odour
   (acetone), impregnated with deltamethrin and used to control tsetse
   flies (Glossina morsitans morsitans), were investigated in the Kasungu
   National Park, Malawi. Mammals and birds were censused simultaneously
   along transects in `Miombo' woodland or `Dambo' grassland/mixed
   woodland, with and without targets. Mammals were also monitored by
   surveys of their spoor on experimentally cleared plots (5 m in diameter)
   and a target relocation experiment was conducted when the targets were
   removed from the test transects and transferred to the controls.
   Significantly fewer small antelopes (e.g. common Duiker Sylvicapra
   grimmia) were detected in plots along transects with targets (tests)
   than along control transects. The presence of targets affected the
   frequency of occurrence of antelopes, suids and large herbivores in the
   experimental plots, but small carnivores, monkeys, rodents and hares
   were unaffected. A conclusion of the relocation experiment was that the
   deltamethrin-impregnated cloth was responsible for the observed effects
   and not the acetone. A total number of 23 species of birds meeting a
   criterion for their abundance in the areas surveyed were selected for
   detailed analyses. Lower indices in the test areas than in the controls
   were recorded for 15 of these 23 species in the Dambos and for 10 of 21
   species in the Miombo woodland. Matched paired comparisons revealed
   significantly lower numbers in the test areas than in the controls in
   both habitats only for black-headed Oriole Oriolus larvatus, but for
   Grey Lourie Corythaixoides concolor, little bee-eater Merops pusillus,
   fork-tailed Drongo Dicrurus adsimilis and combined data on three species
   of sunbirds in the Dambos. The black-eyed bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus had
   significantly lower numbers in the tests than in the controls in Miombo
   woodland. The numbers of three species of dove were higher in the tests
   than in the controls in both habitats, significantly so for the Cape
   turtle dove Streptopelia capicola, and numbers of the Flappet Lark
   Mirafra rufocinnamomea were significantly higher in the tests than in
   the controls in Dambos. The results are discussed in the light of
   previous studies on environmental effects of tsetse control, including
   effects of tsetse targets on pollinators especially non-target
   horseflies.}},

Abstract = {{When flowers are harvested from wild plants an issue for conservation
   managers is whether sufficient seeds remain for population replacement,
   especially if it is subject to recurrent disturbance. Field data on the
   effect of flower picking on seed availability over 13 years were
   available for the most heavily exploited wildflower in Australia,
   Banksia hookeriana fire-killed shrub restricted to a 2000 km(2) area in
   the northern sandplains of southwestern Australia. These were combined
   with demographic data from 14 long-term monitoring plots scattered over
   the landscape. Growing conditions were termed `good' to `poor' depending
   on how they affected the number of inflorescences produced, and
   recruitment of young plants. A computer model was developed based on
   best-fit equations for all key processes accounting for seed and
   seedling production and loss. The model indicates that self-replacement
   (maintenance of a stable population size at a given age from one
   generation to the next) is unlikely for the first 5-11 years following
   fire, depending on growing conditions, even in the absence of picking.
   Picking has little effect on the minimum fire interval for
   self-replacement under good growing conditions, but, under poor
   conditions, minimum fire interval rises from 12 years at 0\% picking to
   20 years at 30\% picking. Miscalculation of the intensity of picking
   allowable could have serious consequences for conservation of wild
   populations, as fires are most likely at 10-20 year intervals. A second
   computer model took inter-fire establishment into account. It gave
   similar results for self-replacement conditions, but also indicated that
   the level of picking that could be sustained diminishes sharply once
   fires occur at intervals > 20 years. We suggest caution be exercised by
   conservation authorities in setting the age to first picking and the
   levels of picking permitted for wild populations of Banksia hookeriana.
   Our models are suitable for a wide range of vulnerable, fire-killed
   species at present harvested from the wild. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Population dynamics and future conservation of a free-ranging black

Volume = {{99}},

Pages = {{237-243}},

Abstract = {{The black rhinoceros has declined throughout its range since the 1960s
   as a result of illegal killing to supply the international trade in
   rhino horn. However, in recent years the decline has been halted and
   reversed as a result of the protection and management of rhinos in a
   small number of key areas. This paper assesses population recovery in
   one such area, the Masai Mara, since the mid 1980s, using data from
   daily surveillance patrols. Although a partial recovery to 35
   individuals at a growth rate of 9.8\% per annum took place until 1994,
   the population then appeared to decline to 23 individuals by 1999. At no
   point did the population size or density approach that of the population
   prior to poaching. The apparent decline could be a result of death,
   dispersal or an increased reclusiveness amongst some individuals.
   Evidence suggests that this population extends beyond both protected
   area and international borders within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, and
   a comparison of the age and sex structure of present versus disappeared
   rhinos implies that dispersal of sub-adult individuals may partly
   explain the recent decline. Intensive monitoring with regular assessment
   of rhino population performance is vital to avoid complacency and
   identify potential problems quickly. It is recommended that cross-border
   monitoring is implemented to identify and protect the full range of this
   population, and to try to ascertain the fate of individuals that have
   disappeared. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We examined occurrence patterns and habitat data for the Virginia
   northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus) in the central
   Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, USA with the intent to develop a
   habitat model. Topographic conditions (elevation, landform index,
   surface curvature, slope gradient and aspect) and proximity to
   coniferous cover were evaluated for three study areas where flying
   squirrel presence has been documented via nest box surveys. In our
   model, Virginia northern flying squirrel presence was associated with
   proximity to conifer cover (P < 0.001), but not to any other habitat
   variables tested. We developed a logistic regression model and
   implemented that within a geographic information system to delineate
   potential habitat. Statistical relations were not sufficient to predict
   flying squirrel occurrence with a reasonable degree of confidence.
   Current nest box monitoring efforts provide needed year-to-year
   population trend information, however, they are not sufficient to
   delineate potential habitat using quantitative approaches. More detailed
   micro- and macro-habitat relationship studies of the Virginia northern
   flying squirrel will be necessary for successful management and eventual
   recovery of this endangered species. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   between fullsibs in other bird species. This result supports the
   evidence of its historical rarity in the wild and suggest that the birds
   studied belong to a small population. Thus, the technique applied here
   is an important tool for monitoring the remaining genetic variability of

Abstract = {{A series of studies evaluating the impact, dynamics, and distribution of
   the established biological control agent Hydrellia pakistanae (Diptera:
   Ephydridae) on Hydrilla verticillata (Hydrocharitaceae) was conducted.
   The studies included establishment of fly damage thresholds with
   artificial infestations of flies in tanks, intensive monthly field
   monitoring of fly densities and damage at one site, and seasonal
   monitoring of fly densities in six regions in Florida. The results of
   tank studies indicated that fly damage approached an asymptote in the
   top 20 cm of the hydrilla canopy when infested with 4000 larvae/m(2).
   Above this level only a slight increase in hydrilla damage occurred as
   fly densities increased. Fly damage was concentrated in the top 20 cm
   (84.5\%) and in the meristems (14.1\%) of the hydrilla canopy. Hydrilla
   biomass was reduced with higher fly densities in the top 20 cm stratum
   when the plants were grown at the low fertilizer treatment. Field
   collections made in south Florida indicated that the hydrilla nitrogen
   content (fresh mass) was a major limiting factor that influenced fly
   densities. In the more northern regions of our studies, central and
   northern Florida, cold winter weather limited the seasonal distribution
   of the host plant and associated flies. In response to increased
   seasonal temperatures, fly densities increased each spring and summer.
   Consequently, field densities of flies and the associated damage to
   hydrilla populations never reached more than 15 adults/m(2) and 15\% of
   the whorls damaged, respectively, about one-fifth the level estimated
   from cage studies that severely impact plant biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last three decades, there has been significant changes in the
   lifestyles of communities, including food habits, and food purchasing
   and consumption patterns in the Southeast Asian region. As a result,
   there is a definite change in the food and nutrition issues in the
   region. Nutritional deficiencies in many of these countries are slowly
   being decreased in magnitude. On the other hand, the significant
   proportions of the population are now faced with the other facet of the
   malnutrition problem, namely diet-related chronic diseases. However,
   because of the different stages of socio-economic development, the
   extent of each of these extremes of the malnutrition problems varies
   considerably between the different countries in Southeast Asia.
   Nutrition needs in the new millennium would necessarily differ somewhat
   among these countries while at the same time, there would be a
   considerable amount of similarities. This presentation highlights
   several macro issues that countries in the region may focus on in the
   near future.
   Various intervention programmes have been undertaken by authorities to
   tackle the co-existence of twin faces of malnutrition in many developing
   countries. It would be desirable to have a blue print of such programmes
   and activities in the National Plans of Action for Nutrition (NPANs).
   The NPAN should be more than a framework or a descriptive document. It
   should be a tool for action, an operational plan that sets out
   priorities; identifies projects and activities, with details of
   implementation such as what, how and when; designates responsibilities
   and accountability for the activities; identifies resource requirements
   and their source; and sets out the plan for monitoring and evaluation.
   One of the main obstacles in the formulation and effective
   implementation of intervention programmes in developing countries is the
   lack of comprehensive data on the extent of the problems in many cases
   and the causes of such problems specificy to the communities concerned.
   It is thus imperative to identify appropriate research priorities and
   conduct relevant studies. It is also important to have basic baseline
   data collected at regular intervals such as nutritional status of
   communities and dietary intake. To conduct all these activities, it is
   vital to ensure adequate funding, preferably through establishing a
   dedicated fund for research.
   There should be closer collaboration between countries in the region in
   all nutrition activities to enable sharing of resources, experiences and
   learn from the mistakes of others. One existing mechanism is through the
   ASEAN structure. The other existing mechanisms are through WHO and FAO.
   One other mechanism is through the International Life Sciences Institute
   (ILSI) Southeast Asian Branch.
   Closely related to this need for networking is the need for continuing
   harmonization of approaches to nutrition activities in the region.
   Current efforts in harmonisation include RDA, nutritional status
   assessment methodologies and dietary guidelines. Other areas of
   harmonisation in the near future include nutrition labelling and claims.}},

Abstract = {{New World parrots are declining throughout their range. Blue and Gold
   Macaw Ara ararauna was extirpated from the island of Trinidad in the
   late 1960s through anthropogenic processes. The Cincinnati Zoo \&
   Botanical Garden is assisting the Wildlife Section of the Forestry
   Division, Trinidad on a mission to restore the species into its
   historical range within the Bush-Bush Sanctuary in the Nariva Swamp. The
   Sanctuary has been protected by the government of Trinidad and is the
   home of the endangered Red-bellied Macaw Ara manilata and West Indian
   Manatee Trichechus manatus. Zoo and Wildlife personnel participated in
   three separate releases, beginning in December 1999 through to March
   2000. The initial release consisted of an identical sex group of macaws
   followed by two additional releases of pairs/groups of birds. Of 18 Blue
   and Gold Macaws, 14 were released into the Nariva Swamp and are
   currently being monitored by the Wildlife Section, Zoo personnel and
   surrounding community. Translocation of wild populations of parrots has
   proven to be a viable solution to restocking wild populations that have
   been regionally extirpated.}},

Abstract = {{Six species of insects and a rust fungus have been successfully
   established for biocontrol of the weed Parthenicum hysterophorus L. in
   Queensland, Australia. Effectiveness of biocontrol insects was evaluated
   at two properties in Queensland during 1996-97 based on an exclusion
   experiment using insecticides. Parthenium-infested plots with and
   without biocontrol insects were sampled at monthly intervals and the
   impact of biocontrol insects on parthenium at individual plant and whole
   population levels monitored. Biocontrol insects were more effective at
   Mt Panorama (central Queensland) than at Plain Creek (north Queensland).
   At Mt Panorama, the leaf-feeding beetle Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister
   caused 96\% defoliation and the stem-galling moth Epiblema strenuana
   Walker affected 100\% of the plants, resulting in reductions of 90\% in
   weed density, 40\% in plant height, and 82\% in flower production.
   Exclusion of biocontrol insects resulted in a 52\% increase in seedling
   emergence and a seven-fold increase in the soil seed bank in the
   following season. At Plain Creek, E. strenuana was the only prominent
   agent. It affected 92\% of the plants and prevented 32\% of plants from
   producing any flowers, reduced plant height by 40\% and flower
   production by 49\%, but did not reduce the plant biomass, weed density
   or soil seed bank. However, exclusion of biocontrol insects resulted in
   an eight-fold increase in the soil seed bank in the following season.}},

Abstract = {{We used published and unpublished data to compare mourning dove, Zenaida
   macroura, recruitment among the 1949-50 (early), 1979-80 (middle), and
   1992-95 (late) periods in riparian habitat at Gray Lodge Wildlife Area,
   California, to document any differences that corresponded to the
   long-term decline of doves in California (as estimated by the U.S. Fish
   and Wildlife Service's annual Call-count Survey). Estimates of true nest
   success, fledglings produced per nesting attempt, and fledglings
   produced per active dove pair, were highest in the early period, lowest
   in the middle period, and low to moderate in the late period (nest
   success: 44-56\% early, 25-29\% middle, 24-35\% late; fledglings/nest
   attempt: 1.20-1.44 early, 0.78-0.91 middle, 0.81-1.03 late;
   fledglings/pair: 5.93-6.58 early, 2.40-3.40 middle, 5.00-5.60 late). In
   the early period, high production coincided with the warmest and driest
   spring weather and an active predator control program, conditions
   thought to boost dove production. However, based on banding estimates of
   survival, fledgling production/pair during each period should have been
   more than adequate to increase breeding populations (2.5 required) (with
   the exception of 1980). Therefore, continued population decline in
   California must result from landscape-scale habitat alteration, poor
   survival, or both, and not recruitment; or high recruitment at Gray
   Lodge was not representative of California nesting doves (or riparian
   habitats) in general; or the three periods during which data were
   collected at Gray Lodge were too infrequent relative-to the 47-year time
   period to detect long-term change in recruitment. Initiation of a
   wing-collection survey to monitor harvest age ratios and an operational
   banding program to estimate survival would ultimately provide more
   predictable data sets for analyses of long-term trends in annual
   population status than would additional analyses of historical nesting
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Populus deltoides var. wislizenii (S. Wats.) Eckenwalder (cottonwood)
   forests along the Rio Grande drainage are predicted to disappear within
   this century. We evaluated stand health over 3 years by examining the
   sex ratio, size, and spatial distribution of male, female, and
   nonreproductive trees in six even-aged stands of P. deltoides spanning
   280 km along the Rio Grande drainage. There was no evidence of biased
   sex ratios or spatial segregation of sexes; however, tree mortality was
   strongly related to reproductive status. In the most stressed
   population, over half of the mature trees remained nonreproductive and a
   substantial number switched from reproductive to nonreproductive status.
   Logistic regression revealed that over all populations, tree size,
   reproductive status in previous years, and population were significant
   factors affecting reproduction. By considering physiological and
   environmental differences, we determined two groups of nonreproductive
   individuals: those previously reproductive that became nonreproductive
   and those that remained nonreproductive over the 3 years. The former
   group appeared to be under greater physiological and environmental
   stress. Monitoring the rate at which individuals change reproductive
   status provides an effective and simple measurement that can predict
   survival of riparian cottonwood populations.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial structure of plant communities as well as the quality and
   abundance of neighbours can strongly influence the intensity of
   herbivory suffered by a plant. In this paper, we study the effect of the
   association with shrubs on the ungulate herbivory suffered by Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris var. nevadensis Christ., Pinaceae) saplings in two
   isolated, fragmented populations in southeastern Spain. For this, we
   monitored herbivory on saplings with regard to the microhabitat in which
   they grew. We distinguished pines growing in open interspaces, on the
   edge of shrubs and within the canopy of shrubs, and also we
   distinguished four functional types of shrubs: thorny shrubs, nonthorny
   shrubs, thorny scrubs, and nonthorny scrubs. Our results show that
   association with shrubs increases the damage inflicted on Scots pine
   saplings. In fact, saplings growing in the open patches, far from the
   shrubs, escaped from herbivory more frequently and incurred less damage
   than did saplings growing close to shrubs. However, herbivory was also
   reduced when pine saplings were completely surrounded by shrubs, since
   then they served as a mechanical barrier. The type of neighbouring shrub
   did not affect the overall damage suffered by pines, despite the fact
   that the ungulates damaged the nonthorny scrubs more intensely than the
   other kinds of shrubs. Consequently, saplings have an advantage when
   growing within the canopy of shrubs; these constitute key microsites for
   pine recruitment in these Mediterranean forests.}},

Abstract = {{Spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius) were monitored for eyeflukes
   monthly at four sites in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, from spring
   through autumn in 1997 and 1998. In general, mean abundance of
   Diplostomum spp. in the lens of spottail shiners was highest at sites
   near large ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) colonies and was higher
   in 1998 than in 1997. Population studies demonstrated a major period of
   recruitment in the late summer - early autumn. Mean abundance increased
   between November and May, when sampling was logistically not possible,
   reflecting late-fall or early-spring recruitment. Golden shiners
   (Notemigonus crysoleucas) and small yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were
   monitored at a single site (Ile aux Ours) in 1997 and 1998. Mean
   abundance of Diplostomum spp. in the lens of golden shiners at Ile aux
   Ours was higher in 1998 than in 1997. Recruitment occurred in the early
   summer and between November and May, suggesting late-fall or
   early-spring transmission. Mean abundance decreased between August and
   October in both years. Yellow perch at Ile aux Ours were infected with
   four different parasite species in their eyes. Mean abundance of
   Diplostomum spp. in the vitreous humour or retina increased during the
   summer and fall and then decreased between the fall and following
   spring. Diplostomum spp. in the lens increased in abundance in the early
   summer, and then decreased during the fall. Both Tylodelphys scheuringi
   and Neascus spp. in the vitreous humour were more abundant in 0+ than in
   1+ perch. Mean abundance of T. scheuringi increased over the summer in
   1997 and then dropped to zero in the same cohort over winter, suggesting
   that the parasite lives for only 1 year. Neascus spp. only were found in
   1998. Distributional data, together with seasonal information, suggest
   that habitat characteristics contribute significantly to the abundance
   of Diplostomum spp. along the St. Lawrence River. Proximity to gull
   colonies enhances abundance, but higher rates of predation at wetland
   sites depress abundance and restrict the accumulation of parasites.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial salamanders of the family Plethodontidae have unique
   attributes that make them excellent indicators of biodiversity and
   ecosystem integrity in forested habitats. Their longevity, small
   territory size, site fidelity, sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic
   perturbations, tendency to occur in high densities, and low sampling
   costs mean that counts of plethodontid salamanders provide numerous
   advantages over counts of other North American forest organisms for
   indicating environmental change. Furthermore, they are tightly linked
   physiologically to microclimatic and successional processes that
   influence the distribution and abundance of numerous other hydrophilic
   but difficult-to-study forest dwelling plants and animals. Ecosystem
   process such as moisture cycling, food-wed dynamics, and succession,
   with their related structural and microclimatic variability, all affect
   forest biodiversity and have been shown to affect salamander populations
   as well. We determined the variability associated with sampling for
   plethodontid salamanders by estimating the coefficient of variation (CV)
   from available time-series data. The median coefficient of variation
   indicated that variation in counts of individuals among studies was much
   lower in plethodontids (27\%) than in lepidoptera (93\%), passerine
   birds (57\%), small mammals (69\%), or other amphibians (37-46\%), which
   means plethodontid salamanders provide an important statistical
   advantage over other species for monitoring long-term forest health.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem health and agricultural wealth in North America depend on a
   particular invertebrate fauna to deliver pollination services. Extensive
   losses in pollinator guilds and communities can disrupt ecosystem
   integrity, a circumstance that today forces most farmers to rely on
   honey bees for much fruit and seed production. Are North America's
   invertebrate pollinator faunas already widely diminished or currently
   threatened by human activities? How would we know, what are the
   spatiotemporal scales for detection, and which anthropogenic factors are
   responsible? Answers to these questions were considered by participants
   in a workshop sponsored by the National Center for Ecological Analysis
   and Synthesis in October of 1999, and these questions form the nucleus
   for the papers in this special issue. Several contributors critically
   interpret the evidence for declines of bee and fly pollinators, the
   pollination deficits that should ensue, and their economic costs.
   Spatiotemporal unruliness in pollinator numbers, particularly bees, is
   shown to hinder our current insights, highlighting the need for refined
   survey and sampling designs. At the same time, two remarkable studies
   clearly show the long-term persistence of members of complex bee
   communities. Other authors offer new perspectives on habitat
   fragmentation and global warming as drivers of pollinator declines. Bees
   and lepidopterans are contrasted in terms of their natural genetic
   variation and their consequent resilience in the face of population
   declines. Overall, many ecologists and conservation biologists have not
   fully appreciated the daunting challenges that accompany sampling
   designs, taxonomy, and the natural history of bees, flies, and other
   invertebrate pollinators, a circumstance that must be remedied if we are
   to reliably monitor invertebrate pollinator populations and respond to
   their declines with effective conservation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator systems inherently possess wide variation that limits
   the applicability of surveys on population dynamics or diversity. Stable
   habitats are scarcely studied, whereas dynamics in unprotected habitats
   are less predictable or more compromised by exotic organisms (Apis, in
   the case of bee surveys). An extensively replicated, long-term study of
   orchid-bees (Euglossini) was made in protected tropical moist forest in
   Panama. Over 47,000 bees were recorded in 124 monthly censuses employing
   1952 counts. No aggregate trend in abundance occurred (from 1979 to
   2000), although four individual species declined, nine increased, 23
   showed no change, and species richness was stable. No rare or parasitic
   species showed decreasing trends, while the most common of the set of
   bee species studied gradually declined. Biodiversity therefore
   increased. Recorded variability included 300\% (fourfold) differences in
   bee abundance among years, and changes in species abundance up to
   14-fold. Surveys in dry and wet seasons (N = 17 and 18 years, 29 and 31
   species, respectively) indicated no numerical changes in the bee
   assemblage over 21 years. El-Ni (n) over tildeo climatic events led to
   brief increases in bee abundance. This detailed survey is deconstructed
   to assess sampling rigor and strategies, particularly considering the
   recorded local differences within a single forest.
   Year-to-year shifts in bee abundance for three tropical and five
   temperate bee censuses were comparable. In short studies (2-4 years) and
   during longer studies (17-21 years), 59 species that included solitary,
   social, and highly social bees had mean abundances that varied by
   factors of 2.06 for temperate bees and 2.16 for tropical bees.
   ``Normal{''} bee populations commonly halved or doubled in 1-yr
   intervals. Longer term data are only available for the tropics.
   Stochastic variation and limitations of monitoring methods suggest that
   minimum series of four years (i.e., three intervals) of several counts
   during the active season may demonstrate genuine trends. Longer term,
   continuous studies are still needed for meaningful insights on
   pollinator population shifts in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in flower-visiting insect populations or communities that result
   from human impacts can be documented by measuring spatial or temporal
   trends, or by comparing abundance or species composition before and
   after disturbance. The level of naturally occurring variation in
   populations and communities over space and time will dictate the
   sampling effort required to detect human-induced changes. We compiled a
   set of existing surveys of the bee faunas of natural communities from
   around the world to examine patterns of abundance and richness. We
   focused on a subset of these studies to illustrate variation in bee
   communities among different sites and within sites over different
   spatial and temporal scales. We used examples from our compilation and
   other published studies to illustrate sampling approaches that maximize
   the value of future sampling efforts. Existing studies suggest that bee
   faunas are locally diverse, highly variable in space and time, and often
   rich in rare species. All of these attributes indicate that intense
   sampling among sites and years will be required to differentiate changes
   due to specific impacts from the natural dynamics of populations and
   communities. Given the limits on time and funding for studying bees,
   approaches that maximize information for effort must be sought for
   future studies. Reliable information on population and community changes
   may be gleaned from examining ``functional groups{''} rather than entire
   faunas. Regardless of the purpose of the study, standardized sampling
   protocols using replicated designs will increase the value of data.
   Standardization permits statistical testing of changes in bee
   populations and communities, and allows for rigorous comparison between
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile consumers have potential to cause a cascading of habitat
   degradation beyond the region that is directly stressed, by
   concentrating in refuges where they intensify biological interactions
   and can deplete prey resources. We tested this hypothesis on
   structurally complex, species-rich biogenic reefs created by the eastern
   oyster, Crassostrea virginica, in the Neuse River estuary, North
   Carolina, USA. We (1) sampled fishes and invertebrates on natural and
   restored reefs and on sand bottom to compare fish utilization of these
   different habitats and to characterize the trophic relations among large
   reef-associated fishes and benthic invertebrates, and (2) tested whether
   bottom-water hypoxia and fishery-caused degradation of reef habitat
   combine to induce mass emigration of fish that then modify community
   composition in refuges across an estuarine seascape. Experimentally
   restored oyster reefs of two heights (1 m tall ``degraded{''} or 2 m
   tall ``natural{''} reefs) were constructed at 3 and 6 m depths. We
   sampled hydrographic conditions within the estuary over the summer to
   monitor onset and duration of bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia, a disturbance
   resulting from density stratification and anthropogenic eutrophication.
   Reduction of reef height caused by oyster dredging exposed the reefs
   located in deep water to hypoxia/anoxia for >2 wk, killing
   reef-associated invertebrate prey and forcing mobile fishes into refuge
   habitats. Refugee fishes accumulated at high densities on reefs in
   oxygenated shallow water, where they depleted epibenthic crustacean prey
   populations. Thus, physical disturbances can impact remote, undisturbed
   refuge habitats through the movement and abnormal concentration of
   refugee organisms that have subsequent strong trophic impacts. These
   results have implications for the design of Marine Protected Areas
   (MPAs), showing that reserves placed in proximity to disturbed areas may
   be impacted indirectly but may serve a critical refuge function on a
   scale that matches the mobility of consumers.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of anthropogenic disturbances requires appropriate
   sampling design and powerful statistical tests. This study illustrates
   how simulations of environmental disturbances may be used to improve the
   capability of any given sampling design to detect impacts of a specified
   magnitude. Here, real data on the abundance of algae and invertebrates
   are used to simulate the effects of environmental disturbances on two
   rocky shores in the northwest Mediterranean. Natural populations were
   sampled eight times between 1995 and 1996 in mid-shore habitats on-each
   of two shores. Four sites were sampled at each of three different levels
   on the shore each time. Three replicate quadrats were sampled in each
   site. This design was rearranged to create two ``Impacted{''} and two
   ``Control{''} sites at each level on each shore. The first four times
   were used as ``Before{''} data; the latter four times represented a
   series of ``After{''} data. Two different approaches were used to
   simulate environmental impacts. The first was based on the methodology
   developed in the context of Beyond BACI designs, and consisted in
   altering the mean abundance of organisms of known amounts at the
   ``Impacted{''} sites for the ``After{''} series of data. Simulated data
   were generated by multiplying the real values by random variates
   obtained from binomial distributions of means 0.8, 0.5, and 0.2, to
   simulate reductions in mean abundance to 0.8, 0.5, and 0.2,
   respectively. These data were analyzed using analysis of variance
   following the logic of Beyond BACI designs. A Monte Carlo procedure was
   also developed based on the linear model of the Beyond BACI design,
   using real estimates of spatial and temporal variance of the red alga
   Rissoella verruculosa. Power of the Before/After vs. Control/Impact (B X
   I) interaction was calculated from sets of 1000 simulations under the
   alternative hypothesis of an impact causing a reduction in mean
   abundance of the alga to 0.5. Power curves were generated for the B X I
   interaction using different combinations of number of sites, number of
   times, and number of replicate plots, thereby providing a direct way of
   optimizing the sampling design.
   In most cases impacts were detected as significant changes from before
   to after the simulated disturbances in the differences between the
   impacted and control sites. The probability of detecting an impact was
   not consistent between the two shores, and it also changed in relation
   to level on the shore. Statistical power was large for several of the
   tests involved in the detection of the simulated impacts. Sample size
   was also calculated for different combinations of Type I and Type II
   errors, indicating that the sample size required to design powerful
   environmental sampling programs can be maintained within a range of
   acceptable and logistically feasible sampling efforts for these rocky
   shores. In some cases it was not possible to proceed with calculation of
   power and sample size using classical procedures based on non-central F
   distributions, due to the impossibility of providing an error term with
   a single component of variation. The Monte Carlo procedure developed
   here solved this problem, providing a tool of potential wide application
   for the design and optimization of environmental sampling programs.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the relative importance of riparian vs. upland habitats to
   breeding birds by comparing species abundance, richness, and similarity
   of bird communities in managed Douglas-fir forests in western Washington
   State, USA. We also examined whether forested buffer strips along
   second- and third-order streams effectively maintain the pre-logging
   riparian breeding bird community by comparing species abundance,
   richness, and turnover among three treatments: (1) unharvested controls;
   (2) sites that were clear-cut, leaving a narrow (similar to 14 m)
   forested buffer on both sides of the stream; and (3) sites that were
   clear-cut, leaving a wide (similar to 31 m) forested buffer along both
   sides of the stream.
   Deciduous trees, berry-producing shrubs, and other deciduous shrubs less
   common in adjacent upland forest characterized streamside zones. Despite
   different vegetation features, riparian and upland habitats did not
   differ in any measures of bird species richness and composition. No
   species or species group was more abundant in the upland. Neotropical
   migrants, resident species, and species associated with deciduous trees
   and shrubs in forested habitats were more abundant in riparian habitats
   than in adjacent uplands. Total bird abundance and abundance of four
   species (American Robin {[}Turdus migratorius], Pacific-slope Flycatcher
   {[}Empinonax difficilis], Black-throated Gray Warbler {[}Dendroica
   nigrescens], and Winter Wren {[}Troglodytes troglodytes]) were higher in
   riparian habitats. Abundance of these riparian associates was correlated
   with percent cover of berry-producing shrubs and the number of deciduous
   trees in the canopy.
   We found that the number of breeding bird species on sites with narrow
   buffers increased from slightly fewer than controls before harvest to an
   average of 10 more species than controls after harvest, a change
   reflected in an average 20\% increase in species turnover on
   narrow-buffer sites relative to controls. Total bird abundance did not
   differ between treatments and controls. Resident species, those species
   associated with shrubs in forested habitats and conifer trees, declined
   on both buffer treatments. Species associated with upland and riparian
   forests (Black-throated Gray Warble;, Golden-crowned Kinglet {[}Regulus
   satrapa], and Brown Creeper {[}Certhia americana]) decreased in
   abundance on riparian buffer treatments relative to controls, whereas
   species associated with open, shrubby habitats (Dark-eyed Junco {[}Junco
   hyemalis], Cedar Waxwing {[}Bombycilla cedrorum], and Song Sparrow
   {[}Melospiza melodia]) increased in abundance on one or both riparian
   buffer treatments.
   High species turnover on narrow-buffer treatments indicated that buffers
   < 14 m on each side of the stream did not maintain the pre-logging bird
   community. There was little difference in species turnover or species
   richness between the wide-buffer treatment and the control, indicating
   that a 30-m buffer on both sides of second-order and third-order streams
   maintains most of the pre-logging bird community in the first two years
   postharvest. The Black-throated Gray Warbler was the only riparian
   associate to decline on both the narrow- and wide-buffer treatments; its
   abundance was positively correlated with buffer width, and a buffer
   greater than or equal to 45 m wide on each side of second- and
   third-order streams was needed to support populations at densities found
   on unharvested controls. To maintain the entire breeding bird community
   associated with forested riparian habitats in the coastal Northwest, we
   recommend a minimum buffer of 45 m along both sides of second- and
   third-order streams. Habitat features such as deciduous trees (Alnus
   rubra and Acer macrophyllum) and berry-producing shrubs (especially
   Rubus spectabilis) appear to be important and should be maintained
   within forested riparian buffer strips.
   This study documents short-term effects of riparian treatments on the
   breeding bird community, which may take several years to respond to
   habitat manipulations. Thus, we recommend continued monitoring to assess
   long-term effects of buffer width reduction.}},

Abstract = {{A general prediction for aging placental mammals is that they should
   show a decline in reproductive value, and reproductive effort is
   therefore predicted to increase with age. To test this, we monitored
   known-age radio-collared females of a large ungulate, the moose (Alces
   alces), in a Swedish population. Female moose showed senescence in
   reproduction (i.e., litter size) from about 12 yr of age. Further
   evidence of senescence was a decrease in parental care during summer
   (expressed as increased offspring mortality) with the mother's age.
   Moreover, aging females facing a declining reproductive value increased
   their reproductive effort by giving birth to heavier offspring
   regardless of litter size. A logistic regression model showed that older
   moose have to give birth to heavier offspring to achieve the same
   offspring summer survival as that for offspring of younger mothers. This
   suggests that females increase their reproductive effort (by increasing
   offspring mass) as they get older. Furthermore, the rather intense
   harvest in our population may select for an increased reproductive
   effort in terms of litter size, which furthermore may select for an
   earlier onset of senescence in reproductive characters and mortality.}},

Abstract = {{The lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer),is an important
   economic pest hi poultry production systems. Spatial analysis of the
   beetle population and environmental parameters can aid the integrated
   management of this pest species. A mealworm population was monitored
   weekly using tube traps in a broiler facility for Eve consecutive nock
   grow-outs ranging from 5 to 8 wk each. Litter temperature, pH, and
   relative humidity were measured concurrently at six of the same
   locations as tube trap placement. A geographic information system was
   used to display weekly spatial relationships of adult and larval beetles
   during each flock grow-out. Spatial maps of beetle populations showed
   that low numbers of the beetles were found in the half of the facility
   used to initiate each nock grow-out during weeks 1-3. Beetle numbers
   increased continuously in all areas of the facility in latter weeks of
   each grow-out. Using ranges of environmental conditions considered
   favorable to the beetles, we developed a model to predict locations of
   high beetle densities. A comparison of the predictive model to actual
   counts of adult and larval beetles showed percentages of agreement
   ranging from 20.0 to 86.7\%. The accuracy of the predictive model had
   limits imposed by house environmental conditions and by beetle movement
   restrictions. Spatial maps of beetle occurrence based on trap counts
   display areas in the facility where control efforts would have the
   greatest impact on beetle numbers, whereas modeling is a less costly
   alternative than conventional sampling methods for finding areas of high
   beetle occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the relation between term low birth weight (LBW) and
   ambient air levels of carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter up to 10
   mum in diameter (PM10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The study population
   consisted of singleton, term live births (37-44 weeks of gestation) born
   between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1996 in six northeastern cities
   of the United States: Boston, Massachusetts; Hartford, Connecticut;
   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Springfield,
   Massachusetts; and Washington, DC. Birth data were obtained from
   National Center for Health Statistics Natality Data Sets. Infants with a
   birth weight < 2,500 g were classified as LBW. Air monitoring data
   obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency were used to
   estimate average trimester exposures to ambient CO, PM10, and SO2. Our
   results suggest that exposures to ambient CO and SO2 increase the risk
   for term LBW. This risk increased by a unit increase in CO third
   trimester average concentration {[}adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.31; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.06,1.62]. Infants with SO2 second trimester
   exposures falling within the 25 and < 50th (AOR 1.21; CI 1.07,1.37), the
   50 to < 75th (AOR 1.20; CI 1.08,1.35), and the 75 to < 95th (AOR 1.21;
   CI 1.03,1.43) percentiles were also at increased risk for term LBW when
   compared to those in the reference category (< 25th percentile). There
   was no indication of a positive association between prenatal exposures
   to PM10 and term LBW. Increased ambient levels of air pollution may be
   associated with an increased risk for LBW.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past three decades, an array of legislation with attendant
   regulations has been implemented to enhance the quality of the
   environment and thereby improve the public's health. Despite the many
   beneficial changes that have followed, there remains a
   disproportionately higher prevalence of harmful environmental exposures,
   particularly air pollution, for certain populations. These populations
   most often reside in urban settings, have low socioeconomic status, and
   include a large proportion of ethnic minorities. The disparities between
   racial/ethnic minority and/or low-income populations in cities and the
   general population in terms of environmental exposures and related
   health risks have prompted the ``environmental justice{''} or
   ``environmental equity{''} movement, which strives to create cleaner
   environments for the most polluted communities. Achieving cleaner
   environments will require interventions based on scientific data
   specific to the populations at risk; however, research in this area has
   been relatively limited. To assess the current scientific information on
   urban air pollution and its health impacts and to help set the agenda
   for immediate intervention and future research, the American Lung
   Association organized an invited workshop on Urban Air Pollution and
   Health Inequities held 22-24 October 1999 in Washington, DC. This report
   builds on literature reviews and summarizes the discussions of working
   groups charged with addressing key areas relevant to air pollution and
   health effects in urban environments. An overview was provided of the
   state of the science for health impacts of air pollution and
   technologies available for air quality monitoring and exposure
   assessment. The working groups then prioritized research needs to
   address the knowledge gaps and developed recommendations for community
   interventions and public policy to begin to remedy the exposure and
   health inequities.}},

   sample of 102 children 3-13 years old who were monitored for commonly
   used pesticides. During the summer of 1997, first-morning-void urine
   samples (1-3 per child) were obtained for 88\% of study children and
   analyzed for metabolites of insecticides and herbicides: carbamates and
   related compounds (1-NAP), atrazine (Ah?), malathion (MDA), and
   chlorpyrifos and related compounds (TCPy). TCPy was present in 93\% of
   the samples, whereas 1-NAP, MDA, and AM were detected in 45\%, 37\%, and
   2\% of samples, respectively. Measured intrachild means ranged from 1.4
   mug/L for MDA to 9.2 mug/L for TCPy, and there was considerable
   intrachild variability. For children providing three urine samples,
   geometric mean TCPy levels were greater than the detection limit in 98\%
   of the samples, and nearly half the children had geometric mean 1-NAP
   and MDA levels greater than the detection limit. Interchild variability
   was significantly greater than intrachild variability for 1-NAP (p =
   0.0037) and TCPy (p < 0.0001). The four metabolites measured were not
   correlated within urine samples, and children's metabolite levels did
   not vary systematically by sex, age, race, household income, or putative
   household pesticide use. On a log scale, mean TCPy levels were
   significantly higher in urban than in nonurban children (7.2 vs. 4.7
   mug/L; p = 0.036). Weighted population mean concentrations were 3.9
   {[}standard error (SE) = 0.7; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 2.5, 5.3]
   mug/L for 1-NAP, 1.7 (SE = 0.3; 95\% CI, 1.1, 2.3) mug/L for MDA, and
   9.6 (SE = 0.9; 95\% CI, 7.8, 11) mug/L for TCPy. The weighted population
   results estimate the overall mean and variability of metabolite levels
   for more than 84,000 children in the census tracts sampled. Levels of
   1-NAP were lower than reported adult reference range concentrations,
   whereas TCPy concentrations were substantially higher. Concentrations of
   MDA were detected more frequently and found at higher levels in children
   than in a recent nonprobability-based sample of adults. Overall,
   Minnesota children's TCPy and MDA levels were higher than in recent
   population-based studies of adults in the United States, but the
   relative magnitude of intraindividual variability was similar for adults
   and children.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the GMD passive sampler for its suitability to measure six
   aldehydes over a 7-d period in population exposure studies. The six
   target aldehydes were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein,
   crotonaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal. The GMD sampler contains a
   silica gel-impregnated cellulose pad coated with
   21-dinitrophenyl-hydrazine (DNPH) hydrochloride. This agent reacts with
   formaldehyde to form a hydrazone that is quantified with a
   high-performance liquid chromatograph. The GMD sampler was tested for
   background contamination and aldehyde recoveries after 0, 1, and 7 d of
   storage. Results indicated that the GMD monitor, as currently
   manufactured, is suitable for shorter-term sampling (up to 24 h) of
   formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. It is however not acceptable for sampling
   of acetaldehyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal
   over a 7-d exposure period due to the chemical reactions on the silica
   gel-impregnated cellulose pad. Glyoxal - and methylglyoxal - DNPH
   derivatives formed on the cellulose and Teflon-coated glass fiber pads
   that had been prepared with glycerol under acidic and oxidative
   conditions. Acrolein - and crotonaldehyde - DNPH derivatives diminish
   through the reverse reaction of the DNPH derivatives to form free
   aldehydes under acidic conditions. We showed that the unknown reaction
   products of acrolein and crotonaldehyde derivatives were not pyrazolines
   but probably resulted from E/Z isomerization. These conversion reactions
   are favored in acidic conditions present in either the derivatization
   solution or the collection medium. The most consistent recovery was
   obtained on glass fiber pads. In particular, recoveries of
   crotonaldehyde - and acrolein - DNPH derivatives were increased through
   the use of a pH 4 buffered derivatization solution. These chemical
   instability problems were overcome by using a pH 4 buffer (citric
   acid/sodium citrate) and an alternative hygroscopic agent
   (1,3-butanediol) in the DNPH derivatization solution. Results with DNPH
   derivatives from these spiking experiments were further confirmed with
   gas-phase spiking experiments. We determined the optimal acidity, buffer
   solution, and concentrations of the buffer solution and 1,3-butanediol
   for the DNPH derivatization solution. This new formulation of the DNPH
   derivatization solution can be used for collection of the six target
   aldehydes over a 7-d sampling period.}},

Abstract = {{Control of silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Perring)
   on greenhouse poinsettia with biological agents has been unreliable.
   Serangium parcesetosum m Sicard, a coccinellid predator, appears to have
   great potential for silverleaf whitefly control. In our study, dynamic
   changes in B. argentifolii populations on caged poinsettia in response
   to S. parcesetosum were monitored. Silverleaf whiteflies were introduced
   to caged poinsettias at 1 or 10 adults per plant and 6 weeks later S.
   parcesetosum were introduced at 0, 2 or 4 adults per plant. Within 2
   weeks of Serangium release whitefly mortality increased dramatically,
   and for the ensuing 10 weeks whitefly levels remained at or near those
   observed at time of predator release. Beetle larvae were observed 2 to
   10 weeks after Serangium release when prey was initially high but not
   when prey was initially low. Thus, whitefly control was primarily due to
   prolonged survival and continuous feeding of individual beetles. Our
   data suggest that Serangium may work well in a multiple species
   biological control program for whiteflies on poinsettia. However,
   further study is needed on multiple species interactions within the host
   (pest/plant) species, and on release management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty specimens of silver mullet (Mugil curema Val., 1836) from the La
   Restinga coastal lagoon complex in Margarita Island, Venezuela, and 20
   specimens of the same species cultured in sea water ponds at Boca de
   Rio, in the same locality, were examined for the presence of acid-fast
   bacteria. Samples from the faeces and intestinal contents, kidney, fiver
   and spleen were treated by Petroff method. Smears were taken from the
   centrifuged sediment and stained by a modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique,
   and the sediment was cultured on tubes of Lowenstein-Jensen medium.
   Acid-fast bacteria were detected in smears from five (25\%) of the wild
   mullets, and five (25\%) of the cultured mullets. Three strains of
   mycobacteria were isolated from the wild fish and one strain from the
   cultured fish. These four strains were identified as Mycobacterium
   chelonei subsp. abscessus, M. chelonei subsp. chelonei, M. fortuitum and
   M. scrofulaceum. The strains were isolated from the faeces and spleens
   of the infected fish. The presence of mycobacteria as the aetiological
   agents of tuberculosis in grey mullets and other fish species is
   discussed in relation to the importance of these organisms as potential
   human pathogens. It is recommended that populations of mullets used as a
   source of seed or spawning stock for aquaculture operations be carefully
   monitored to detect the possible occurrence of latent and/or patent
   acid-fast bacterial infections.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on efforts to promote environmental education and
   community mobilization around environmental issues in Hong Kong. It is
   primarily concerned with efforts directed at the broader community (i.e.
   the population as a whole) rather than with environmental education
   through formal school and college curricula. The paper draws on a
   recently completed study commissioned by the Environmental Campaign
   Committee, the principal source of financial support for such efforts
   undertaken by environmental NGOs, community groups and educational
   institutions in Hong Kong. The study examined how and to what effect the
   Committee had used its financial resources between 1994-1999. It also
   examined international experience with a view to recommending changes in
   the overall approach to environmental education and community
   mobilization initiatives and their funding in Hong Kong.
   The paper suggests that the existing approach to community-wide
   environmental education and its funding in Hong Kong have suffered from
   various weaknesses, most notably the absence of an integrated and
   goal-oriented strategy, an over-reliance on a `top-town' campaign-based
   approach, a failure to establish explicit linkages with the concept of
   sustainable development and to ground initiatives at the local
   neighbourhood and community levels, and a preoccupation with the
   financial inputs provided to support this work at the expense of
   effective monitoring and auditing of project outputs and benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The study assessed the value of currently-available data on the rates of
   caesarean section as an indicator of safe-motherhood programmes. Data,
   collected through the routine health information system of the Ministry
   of Health, Kenya, were used for analyzing the available process
   indicators. The methodology of this study illustrates both usefulness
   and limitations of readily-available healthcare information. The rate of
   hospital-based caesarean section was 6.3\% of all births (range
   0.3-37\%), whereas the rate of population-based caesarean section was
   0.95\% (range 0.1\%-4\%). The rate of population-based caesarean section
   indicates a significant unmet need for obstetric care in the rural areas
   and may be a useful tool for monitoring progress on safe-motherhood
   initiatives in poor settings. Rates of population-based caesarean
   section are low in Kenya, especially in the rural areas. The rate of
   caesarean section may be a valuable process indicator for identifying
   the gaps in obstetric care and may be used for advocating improvements
   for healthcare to the relevant authorities.}},

Abstract = {{Current techniques for studying phytoplankton physiology in the field,
   such as measurements of biochemical activities, nutrient addition
   bioassays, and determination of photosynthetic efficiency, are useful
   for assessing the physiology of the bulk community but suffer from a
   lack of specificity. This would be improved by the development of
   single-cell methods for monitoring in situ physiology, Here we develop
   and test an antibody-based assay for identifying phosphate stress in the
   model dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum (Pavillard) Schiller,
   Antiserum was raised against a cell-surface alkaline phosphatase
   purified from P, minimum. Western screening indicated that the antiserum
   reacted with phosphate-stressed cells but not nitrate-stressed or
   phosphate-replete cells in culture. Immunodepletion confirmed the
   identification of this protein as an alkaline phosphatase, Based on
   Western blots, the antiserum appeared to be specific for
   phosphate-regulated proteins in P, minimum because there is no
   discernible cross-reaction with closely related P, micans. A whole-cell
   immunofluorescence assay was used to identify phosphate stress in field
   populations of P, minimum from Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. The
   percentage of labeled P, minimum cells in this environment during the
   summer of 1998 decreased through time as the inorganic phosphate
   concentration increased. The percentage of antibody-labeled cells
   significantly correlated with the percentage of ELF-97-labeled cells
   determined as another single-cell assay of phosphate stress. This is the
   first antibody-based method developed for monitoring cell-specific
   physiology in a dinoflagellate, and the method described here may serve
   as a model for developing similar tools in other species of
   phytoplankton.}},

Abstract = {{The role of diet on the growth, survival and movement of red grouse
   Lagopus lagopus scoticus chicks was examined. We compared two areas of
   moorland in Scotland: a dry heath with a low density of red grouse and
   poor chick survival; and a wetter heath/bog with relatively higher red
   grouse numbers and higher rates of chick survival. There were no
   differences in clutch size or the proportion of eggs hatching between
   the two moors but brood survival was significantly lower on the dry
   heath. Radio-tagged hens with broods were monitored during the first 12
   days following hatching; the chicks were captured, weighed and faecal
   samples collected. Invertebrate samples were collected within brood
   feeding ranges. Analysis of chick faeces was used to identify dietary
   components. Heather comprised the major dietary component on both moors.
   Invertebrates formed a higher component of diet on the wet moor, and
   this was positively correlated with growth rates, which in turn were
   positively correlated with chick survival. We present data from an
   experiment carried out in 1982, in which chicks showed higher growth
   rates with increasing insect availability. We also show that broods in
   which all the chicks survived (4-10 days) had smaller home-range areas
   than broods in which some of the chicks died during this period. We
   suggest that the differences in chick survival between the two
   populations were the result of variations in the abundance of
   invertebrates, particularly tipulids. The protein provided by a high
   invertebrate component in the diet is, therefore, an important
   determinant of the growth and survival of young red grouse chicks in
   some areas.}},

Abstract = {{Gulfwatch, established in 1991, is an international contaminant
   monitoring program in which the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, is used as
   an indicator of the level and extent of contamination in the Gulf of
   Maine. Since 1991, trace metals, PAHs, PCBs, and OC pesticides have been
   measured in mussel tissues at 56 sites, The distribution of most metals
   was relatively uniform throughout the Gulf with the exception of Ag, Ph
   and Cr, However, the concentration of organic contaminants increased in
   a north-to-south direction. High concentrations of contaminants were
   correlated with large human population density and proximity to large
   rivers. Temporal analysis of five sites revealed that the majority of
   contaminant concentrations were either unchanged or decreasing. The
   concentrations of most contaminants were lower than the median of the
   National Status and Trends (NS \& T) Mussel Watch with the exceptions of
   Cr, Hg, Ph and Sigma PCB24, Hg concentrations at > 80\% of the Gulfwatch
   sites exceeded the NS \& T median +1 SD. Gulfwatch continues as a
   primary contaminant monitoring program in the Gulf of Maine, (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The primary screwworm fly Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) (Diptera:
   Calliphoridae) is one of the most important insect pests of livestock in
   neotropical regions, whereas Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius)
   (Diptera: Calliphoridae), the secondary screwworm, is of medical and
   sanitary importance because of its role in the dissemination of
   pathogens. These two species share morphological similarities and both
   may occur in the same myiasis, but in different developmental stages. In
   this work, the usefulness of PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) of mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) for the unambiguous identification of C. hominivorax and C.
   macellaria was investigated. Two specific regions of mtDNA were
   amplified: 870bp from Cytochrome oxidase subunit I and 2100bp from the
   A+T rich/12S region from C. hominivorax and C. macellaria specimens from
   different areas of Brazil. Reliable species-specific PCR-RFLP results
   were obtained for the CO I region and the A+T rich/12S region using the
   restriction enzymes Dra I and Ssp I. These results confirm the
   conservation of CO I diagnostic restriction sites previously reported
   and demonstrate the usefulness of the control region sequences as an
   efficient marker for PCR-RFLP identification of Brazilian screwworm
   flies. The occurrences of intraspecific polymorphic patterns are
   discussed based on frequencies and potential conflicts for species
   identification. PCR-RFLP provides a potentially useful method for
   identifying samples from the areas where these species are monitored.}},

Abstract = {{This combination of molecular-based and metabolic-based methods expanded
   the insight into monitoring the changes in bacterial biodiversity.The
   stimulation of groundwater bacteria to form biofilms, for the
   remediation of polluted aquifers, is subjected to environmental
   regulations that include measurement of effects on microbial
   biodiversity. Groundwater microorganisms contain a proportion of
   unidentified and uncharacterized ultramicrobacteria (UMB) that might
   play a major role in the bioclogging of geological materials. This study
   aimed to assess the changes in genetic and metabolic biodiversity when a
   community of UMB, isolated from groundwater, is stimulated to form
   biofilms on a ceramic surface. UMB were stimulated with aerobic
   conditions and injection of molasses, in reactors reproducing
   groundwater composition and temperature. Concentration of planktonic
   viable UMB, secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and
   biofilm thickness were monitored. The assessment of changes in
   biodiversity was achieved by comparing the initial UMB community to the
   biofilm community, using the single strand conformational polymorphism
   (SSCP) method, the cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA)
   sequences, and the Biolog microplate system. The hypothesis stating that
   indigenous UMB would play a significant role of in the biofilm
   development was corroborated. Within 13 days of stimulation, the UMB
   produced 700 mg L-1 of planktonic EPS and formed a biofilm up to a
   thickness of 1100 mum. This stimulation led to a decrease in genetic
   diversity and an increase in metabolic diversity. The decrease in
   genetic diversity was shown by a reduced number of single strand DNA
   fragments in the SSCP profiles. As such, 16S rDNA sequences from the
   biofilm revealed the predominance of four bacterial groups: Zoogloea,
   Bacillus/Paenibacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonads. A
   significant increase in metabolic diversity was shown by a highest
   substrate richness profile and a lower substrate evenness profile of the
   biofilm bacterial population (p = 0.0 and p = 0.09, respectively). This
   higher metabolic diversity might be a consequence of the stimulation
   that seemed to favor the growth of bacteria having a high nutritional
   versatility. Stimulation of UMB, isolated from groundwater, was
   effective to form a biofilm having a high metabolic biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{We compared raw drift-dive counts of adult brown trout (Salmo trutta
   Linnaeus 1758) with population estimates calculated from mark-resight
   techniques on two occasions in two back-country rivers near Nelson, New
   Zealand. Trout were caught by angling and marked with colour-coded dart
   tags between 1 and 7 days before drift dives were carried out.
   Drift-dive counts in the Owen and Ugly Rivers were 57-66\% and 21-43\%,
   respectively, of the population estimates calculated using the
   mark-resight techniques. Although underwater census is the cheapest and
   easiest way to census adult trout populations in clear-water rivers, a
   large proportion of the trout population may not be seen in rivers with
   abundant in-stream cover. Raw drift-dive counts provide an index of
   relative abundance that is useful for monitoring changes in trout
   populations of specific river reaches over time, However, for
   comparisons between rivers more accurate population estimates are
   required. We recommend a combined approach of raw drift-dive counts and
   the use of mark-resight techniques to provide the best estimates of
   trout numbers. As many trout as possible should be tagged to improve the
   accuracy of mark-resight studies.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding location choice provides a mechanism by which individuals can
   directly influence their reproductive success. Location choice should
   therefore reflect individual condition, habitat features, and the
   intensity of competition; with these factors then influencing
   reproductive success. To test whether such patterns were detectable in
   the wild, we tagged 705 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in a natural
   population, and monitored them from when they started breeding until
   they died. We evaluated the role of individual condition (size,
   secondary sexual traits, energy stores) in the acquisition of breeding
   locations that differed in the intensity of competition (female density,
   sex ratio) and habitat Features (water depth, water velocity). We than
   evaluated the influence of breeding location on reproductive life span
   and energy stores. At a coarse level (20-m stream sections), females
   consistently settled in certain locations, and these locations sustained
   high densities and held larger females. At a fine scale (0.5-m breeding
   sites), ii) larger fish occupied deeper water (males, r(2) = 0.0721
   females, r(2) = 0.199), (2) higher levels of competition reduced
   reproductive life span for males (r(2) = 0.139) but not females, and (3)
   fish with shorter reproductive life spans died with more energy
   remaining in their muscle tissue (males, r(2) = 0.414; Females, r(2) =
   0.440). These patterns were nested within a tendency for late breeding
   fish to have shorter reproductive life spans. Energy stores and
   secondary sexual traits did not influence breeding location choice, and
   larger fish did not acquire locations of higher intrinsic quality (i.e.,
   those sections settled first and sustaining higher competition). Our
   study provides evidence that some aspects of individual condition
   influence breeding location choice, which then influences components of
   reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted in 1992, 1993, and 1994 to determine the
   effects of surface residue on incidence of Cylindrocladium black rot
   (CBR), Sclerotinia blight, and Southern stem rot of peanut in microplots
   in North Carolina. Soil was infested with either Cylindrocladium
   parasiticum, Sclerotium rolfsii, or Sclerotinia minor and plots were
   planted with the peanut cultivars NC 7 or NC 10C. Wheat straw was
   applied to establish 80 to 90\% soil-surface coverage. Disease incidence
   data were collected every 2 weeks in 1992 and weekly in 1993 and 1994.
   Southern stem rot incidence did not increase with straw amendment but
   final inoculum density of Sclerotium rolfsii was highest in
   straw-amended plots. Straw amendment enhanced CBR incidence in 1992, but
   had minimal effects in 1993 and 1994. Neither root rot severity nor
   inoculum density of C. parasiticum was affected by straw treatment.
   Straw application reduced Sclerotinia blight in 1992 and 1993 but not in
   1994 compared with unamended plots. Initial inoculum density had the
   greatest impact on final Sclerotinia minor populations. Soil temperature
   and moisture were monitored in 1993 and 1994. Soil at 0 to 2 cm of depth
   in straw-amended microplots was 1 to 2 degreesC cooler than in unamended
   plots.}},

Abstract = {{The suitability of 24 native species for restoration above the
   timberline in Switzerland was assessed with demographic monitoring of
   their populations after transplanting. The plots were laid out in
   1985-1986 and 1995-1996 on machine-graded ski runs using a total of
   8,603 transplants of native grasses, legumes and forbs. Establishment
   conditions were improved with biodegradable wood-fiber mats and a small
   addition of garden soil. Transplant survival rates were generally good
   after 12 years. The regeneration of mixed stands was clearly
   recognizable because some transplants successfully reproduced by seed,
   and colonizers immigrated from the adjacent natural vegetation and
   neighboring restoration plots. Comparative studies of reproductive
   parameters in transplants and their donor population revealed that
   differences in seed production may become nonsignificant within a short
   time span. These fitness features have important diagnostic value for
   assessing restoration success and provide information on the performance
   of the same or closely related genotypes in their natural populations
   and in the restoration site. The plants studied showed species-specific
   traits in establishment after transplanting. Most species can be
   recommended for restoration in the alpine vegetation belt. The risk of
   restoration failure can be considerably reduced by using species with
   different life-history characteristics. From an ecological point of
   view, this method is a valid alternative to commercial revegetation
   using seed mixtures of non-native species and large amounts of
   fertilizers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarises the annual information on ozone monitoring
   stations and exceedances of ozone threshold values during 1997
   transmitted by the Member States of the European Union in the framework
   of Council Directive 92/72/EEC on air pollution by ozone. In August 1998
   information for the calendar year 1997 was received from all Member
   States and, on a voluntary basis, from 6 other European countries
   (Switzerland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Slovakia). An
   evaluation of the exceedances and annual statistics for 1997 clearly
   shows that ozone is a severe, Pan-European problem. The threshold value
   set for the protection of human health was exceeded substantially and in
   all reporting countries. The threshold value of daily average
   concentrations set for the protection of vegetation was exceeded
   substantially (by up to a factor 3), widely (in all reporting countries)
   and frequently (at several stations on more than 200 days). The
   threshold value of hourly average concentrations set for the protection
   of vegetation was exceeded largely and widely (reported by 10 EU Member
   States and in three out of the six other European countries) on a
   limited number of days. The threshold value for providing information to
   the population was exceeded in 15 countries of which 12 EU Member States
   during a limited number of days. Exceedance of the threshold value for
   warning of the population was reported from one station in Greece.}},

Abstract = {{Natural bioremediation is believed to be the major processes that
   account for both containment of the petroleum-hydrocarbon plume and
   reduction of the contaminant concentrations. In this study, the
   feasibility of applying the microbial enumeration technique was assessed
   for natural biodegradation evaluation at three selected gasoline spill
   sites. At each site. two monitor wells were installed along the
   groundwater flow, and one multilevel sampler (MLS) was installed to
   delineate the vertical distribution of the contaminant plume. Two
   continuous soil cores were collected at each site to evaluate the
   horizontal distribution of the microbial activity. Soil samples were
   used for microbial enumeration, grain-size distribution analysis, and
   sediment extraction. In situ tracer study was performed using
   1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB) as the tracer to study the efficiency
   of contaminant biodegradation. investigation results demonstrate the
   agreement between microbial enumeration and other evaluation techniques
   for natural bioremediation (e.g.. geochemical indicator analysis, tracer
   study). Results suggest that the microbial enumeration is useful in
   assessing the occurrence, efficiency, and status of the bioremediation.
   Because this technique provides insight into factors controlling
   contaminant biodegradation, it could be performed as the supplemental
   method for natural bioremediation evaluation at petroleum-hydrocarbon
   spill sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) have
   declined and become fragmented throughout the Pacific Northwest,
   apparently because of the loss of older forests from logging. Because
   clearcut logging continues throughout a large portion of the bird's
   range, there is a pressing need to develop rigorous monitoring
   protocols. We conducted 10-minute dawn surveys at fixed point-count
   stations along 2 roadway segments during mid-July 1991-1996 to quantify
   annual and with in-year spatial variation in detecting marbled
   murrelets. Mean detections/station (pooled across stations) varied among
   years and ranged from 11.3 to 33.8. The greatest within-year difference
   among stations was a range of 0-74 detections, which occurred in the
   same vicinity in 1994; within-year variation between roadway segments
   was not significant (F-1,F-21 = 0.46, P = 0.51). For a specified effect
   size of 0.40, we determined that the sample size needed to detect
   significant differences among years, for alpha = 0.05 and power (1-beta)
   = 0.95, was 22 point-count stations. Number of years required to detect
   an annual decrease in detection of 10\% with one visit to a station/year
   varied according to the precision of estimates, which varied annually
   and ranged between 28-46 years and 12-19 years for alpha = beta = 0.05
   and 0.10, respectively. By visiting each station 20 or 12 times
   annually, it may be possible to detect a 10\% annual decrease in
   detection in 6 years (i.e., 50\% cumulative decline) without
   compromising power or error rate. Assuming that dawn survey detections
   reasonably index habitat distribution or relative abundance, these
   results provide preliminary estimates of sampling effort necessary to
   detect local population decline or within-year differences in murrelet
   habitat distribution in the Yakutat Foreland of southeastern Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Determining reproductive success in birds is important to understand
   population dynamics, habitat quality, and features necessary for
   breeding. We incorporated behavioral observations, nest monitoring, and
   a reproductive index (Vickery et at. 1992a) to: 1)categorize breeding
   status (breeders and nonbreeders) of painted redstarts (Myioborus
   pictus), plumbeous vireos (Vireo plumbeus), and western wood-pewees
   (Contopus sordidulus); 2) locate their nests; 3) monitor nest status;
   and 4) determine nest success and parasitism rates in 14 canyons of the
   Huachuca and Santa Rita mountains, Arizona during 1994-1995. We located
   256 nests along 41.4 km of creek and correctly predicted the
   reproductive state of breeding birds on 61-79\% of the visits without
   having to check nests. Nest success ranged from 35 to 52\%, and
   parasitism rates were 25\% for painted redstart and 40\% for plumbeous
   vireo. Integration of multiple methods allowed us to concentrate on
   breeding status of specific species over large areas while reducing nest
   visits and still obtaining information on nest location, breeding
   status, and nesting success. The predictive ability of the reproductive
   index in a forested system will increase knowledge of breeding status of
   birds such as cavity nesters, whose nests cannot be checked readily,
   rare species, and other bird species that are sensitive to disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The study of quorum-sensing bacteria has revealed a widespread mechanism
   of coordinating bacterial gene expression with cell density. By
   monitoring a constitutively produced signal molecule, individual
   bacteria call limit their expression of group-beneficial phenotypes to
   cell densities that guarantee an effective group outcome. In this paper,
   we attempt to move away from a commonly expressed view that these
   impressive feats of coordination are examples of multicellularity in
   prokaryotic populations. Here, re we look more closely at the individual
   conflict underlying this cooperation, illustrating that, even under
   significant levels of genetic conflict, signalling and resultant
   cooperative behaviour can stably exist. A predictive two-trait model of
   signal strength and of the extent of cooperation is developed as a
   function of relatedness (reflecting multiplicity of infection) and basic
   population demographic parameters. The model predicts that the strength
   of quorum signalling will increase as conflict (multiplicity of
   infecting strains) increases, as individuals attempt to coax more
   cooperative contributions from their competitors, leading to a
   devaluation of the signal as an indicator of density. Conversely, as
   genetic conflict increases, the model predicts that the threshold
   density for cooperation will increase and the subsequent strength of
   group cooperation will be depressed.}},

Abstract = {{1 A recent study revealed the capacity of the Orius insidiosus to
   suppress populations of Frankliniella spp. in field pepper during the
   spring when thrips are rapidly colonizing and reproducing. In this
   study, population abundance in pepper during spring, summer, and autumn
   was determined to understand better predator/prey dynamics under local
   conditions. Local movement between pepper flowers also was quantified to
   examine how population attributes of the predator allow suppression of
   rapidly moving populations of prey.
   2 Randomized complete block experiments established in the autumn of
   1998 and the spring of 1999 included treatments of biological and
   synthetic insecticides, which altered the population densities of
   predator and prey. Numbers of O. insidiosus in relation to prey were
   sufficient in 1998 to prevent build-up of thrips populations. In 1999,
   populations of thrips were unable to recover from near extinction owing
   to persistence of the predator. The predator rapidly recolonized plots
   treated with insecticide.
   3 Greenhouse plants of the same age as field plants were used to monitor
   movement by predators and prey. Movement by F. occidentalis was limited,
   whereas F. tritici and F. bispinosa moved rapidly to the greenhouse
   plants. The males of each thrips species moved more rapidly than the
   females. There was evidence that rapid movement assisted F. tritici and
   F. bispinosa in avoiding predation, but O. insidiosus also moved very
   rapidly to the greenhouse plants. This attribute explains the predator's
   ability to suppress thrips rapidly even when populations are rapidly
   colonizing and reproducing in the flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, are thought to respond to
   high risks of predation by foraging closer to refuge and by forming
   larger groups, but females with newly emergent offspring mostly forage
   alone, a response thought to reduce predation risk on the latter. I
   tested these hypotheses for wild kangaroo populations in southeastern
   Australia, using a field-based experimental reduction of a potential
   predator, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes. I monitored kangaroo foraging
   behaviour in two fox removal and two control sites by counting seats at
   30 and 150 m from refuge during September 1994 and 1995 (after 5 and 16
   months of fox control). I also monitored kangaroo group sizes in all
   sites, using monthly or bimonthly direct observations over 22 months of
   fox reduction. In both years, fox removal caused kangaroos to deposit
   relatively more seats further from refuge than in control sites where
   fox numbers were more than 85\% higher. This suggests strongly that
   kangaroos spend more time foraging close to refuge when predation risk
   is high. Group sizes were also smaller in fox removal sites although
   only during June-October when the majority of females had large pouch
   young. In November-March, group size decreased in all sites owing to the
   solitary behaviour of many females with young at foot. However, where
   foxes were removed, the mean group size of such females was smaller than
   in control sites and females were also more often alone where foxes were
   removed. These results suggest that solitary behaviour increases rather
   than decreases predation risk. This experiment highlights that,grouping
   behaviour is risk sensitive and that some individuals accept higher
   risks of predation to mitigate other costs of group foraging. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Reproductive characteristics of a northeastern Kansas population of the
   fritillary Speyeria idalia (Drury) were studied. Hemolymph juvenile
   hormone (JH) titers, ovarian development, and fat body utilization were
   monitored weekly in adult females over their entire 1997 flight period,
   which extended from mid-June to early October. Dissections of female
   reproductive systems revealed that S. idalia females mate just once,
   soon after they emerge in mid- to late June. Gas chromatographic-mass
   spectrometric determinations of juvenile hormone suggested that they
   undergo a reproductive diapause through mid-August related to the
   absence of or very low titers of juvenile hormone. Oogenesis and fat
   body. depiction do not commence until late August/early September, soon
   after which oviposition occurs. The onset of oogenesis coincides with a
   rapid rise in hemolymph titers of JH I, JH II, and JH III. The
   predominant juvenile hormone homolog was IH II, but both JH I and JH III
   exhibited smaller, concomitant peaks. Four fundamentally different
   lepidopteran reproductive strategies have been recognized based on
   various reproductive characteristics and the type of gonadotropic
   hormones used to stimulate oogenesis. Speyeria idalia exhibits a type of
   reproductive strategy that has not been documented in Lepidoptera,
   typified by protandry, female monandry, long-lived (>8 wk) females that
   feed throughout their adult lives, greatly delayed oogenesis that occurs
   late in adult life, and apparent juvenile hormone control of
   gonadotropic processes. This reproductive strategy appears to be an
   adaptation to the phenology of larval host plants, namely coordinating
   the life cycle with that of the seasonally restricted violets on which
   larval survival of this monophagous species depends.}},

Abstract = {{The gametogenic cycle of Dreissena polymorpha is described for two
   populations living in Lake Come and the Adda River in Northern Italy.
   Reproduction was monitored by histological examinations of gonads and by
   morphometric changes in oocyte nuclei from February 1998 to January
   1999. Gonadal development commenced overwinter. Gamete deposition
   started in spring when the water temperature reached 13 degreesC. By
   May, the reproductive season had commenced but while in Lake Come it
   finished in August, in the Adda River depositions were observed until
   the end of October. The course of the Maturity Index and mainly the
   oocyte nuclei diameter analysis suggested the possibility of two main
   reproductive events in the lake zebra mussel population. In contrast,
   more continuous spawning was observed in the river mussels. In both
   sites, frequency distributions of nucleus size showed maturation of at
   least two gamete cohorts which supported successive depositions. The
   gonadal resting stage was longer in males than females. Oogenesis
   started soon after the end of the reproductive period while
   spermatogenesis commenced only 3 or 4 months later. This is the first
   study dealing with the Dreissena polymorpha reproductive cycle in the
   South Alps. Results are discussed and compared with regard to other
   populations living in the rest of Europe and North America.}},

Abstract = {{The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a representative of the canid family with
   wide distribution in the Northern Hemisphere and Australia. The
   increasing utilization of urbanized habitats by red foxes prompted us to
   test whether this species may be used to monitor the presence of
   anthropogenic polutants in cities or suburbs. For that purpose, we
   compared the concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn) in foxes
   from urban, suburban, and rural areas within the municipality of Zurich
   (Switzerland). The kidney and liver of suburban and rural foxes
   contained the highest Cd concentrations, whereas urban foxes contained
   the highest Pb levels. In the kidney of suburban foxes, Cd
   concentrations increased from a median value of 0.73 mg/kg in juvenile
   animals to 1.82 mg/kg in adults. Similarly, the liver of suburban foxes
   contained increasing Cd levels from a median of 0.21 mg/kg in juvenile
   animals to 0.94 mg/kg in adults. An age-dependent storage of Cd was also
   found in foxes from the rural surroundings, but no such accumulation
   occurred in urban foxes from the city center, where even adult animals
   contained very low Cd levels. Conversely, foxes from the urban center
   were characterized by elevated Pb concentrations during the first 2
   years of life, but this transient Pb accumulation was absent in suburban
   or rural animals. The liver of juvenile foxes contained a median Pb
   concentration of 0.99 mg/kg in the city compared to only 0.47 and 0.37
   mg/kg in the suburban and rural area, respectively. Thus, we found that
   animals from separate environmental compartments contain different
   patterns of tissue residues, implying that red foxes may serve as a
   bioindicator species to detect certain toxic hazards in urbanized
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study is to examine if the bromide (Br) level
   in urine (Br-U) varies substantially among adult general populations of
   either sex or of different dietary habits. For this purpose, morning
   spot urine samples (about 50 per group) were collected from six groups
   of people, i.e., one group each of men and women in a city in Japan
   (thus two groups in Japan) and one group each of women in two urban and
   two rural areas in central and northeast China (four groups in China).
   The samples were analyzed for Br by ECD-gas chromatography after
   derivatization to methyl bromide. Br-U essentially followed a normal
   distribution Whereas there was only a marginal difference in Br-U
   between men (7.7 +/- 2.5 mg/L as an arithmetic mean and arithmetic
   standard deviation) and women (8.1 +/- 2.9 mg/L) in Japan, and no
   difference between the urban (2.3 +/- 0.8 mg/L) and rural women (2.6 +/-
   1.1 mg/L) in China, the difference between Japanese (8.1 +/- 2.9 mg/L)
   and Chinese women (2.3 +/- 0.8 mg/L for two cities and 2.6 +/- 1.1 mg/L
   for two villages) was substantial. A literature survey suggested
   variation in dietary habits, especially that in sea algae intake, is a
   possible factor affecting the observed difference in Br-U between the
   two ethnic groups. Contribution of Br in cereals after fumigation with,
   e.g., methyl bromide, was also thought to be possible. The implication
   of difference in background Br-U levels is discussed in relation to
   biological monitoring of exposure to Br-containing industrial chemicals,
   such as 1- and 2-bromopropane.}},

Abstract = {{While important advances have been made in recovering threatened species
   and restoring damaged habitats on offshore islands, effective
   conservation management is also required on the main (North and South)
   islands if representative elements of New Zealand's remaining
   biodiversity are to be protected. The recent initiation of Mainland
   Island projects constitutes an important step in that ecosystem-focused
   restoration goals are being pursued at mainland sites. The intensity and
   scope of pest control undertaken at Mainland Islands is greater than has
   normally been the case previously, as has been monitoring of results and
   conservation outcomes, Preliminary results suggest that declines in
   monitored species have been arrested and ecological processes
   revitalised. In addition to restoring values at individual sites
   Mainland Islands may be important places where our capacity to manage
   ecosystems more generally may be developed. Advances in our
   understanding of ecological processes and of responses to management
   using sound scientific procedures as part of operational programmes
   could lead to improved predictions to underpin management decisions.
   Refinements to management techniques and the development of appropriate
   skills, as well as enhancing public support and involvement could also
   be expected to have major benefits for conservation management more
   widely. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{121-133}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Since a review of the management of the critically endangered kakapo
   (Strigops habroptilus) in 1994, management of this species has become
   more intensive. This paper reports on new developments in the
   supplementary feeding of kakapo, continuous monitoring and protection of
   nests from predators, translocations of kakapo between islands, and
   artificial incubation of eggs and hand-raising of chicks. Supplementary
   feeding probably increases chick survival especially when natural food
   supplies fail. It may also increase breeding frequency, either by
   triggering breeding, or raising kakapo above a nutritional threshold.
   Protection of nests from predators has eliminated rat predation of eggs
   and chicks, and continuous monitoring and rebuilding of poor nest sites
   has improved kakapo nesting success. Recent translocations of kakapo
   between islands have aimed to prevent possibly infertile males from
   mating, facilitate supplementary feeding, improve the breeding prospects
   of some birds, test the suitability of a new island for kakapo, and
   facilitate the eradication of rats. Eggs have been artificially
   incubated and chicks hand-raised in an attempt to establish a captive
   population of hand-raised birds, to rescue sickly and unthrifty chicks,
   and to forestall likely nest failures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Fragmentation is an important characteristic of the life history,
   population dynamics, and genetic structure of at least five metazoan
   phyla. This study represents a first report of modes of fragmentation
   and their relative importance to population growth in Palythoa
   caribaeorum (Cnidaria, Zoanthidea). Several populations at two coastal
   sites in Brazil (Praia Portinho, on Sao Sebastiao island, and Ponta
   Recife, on the Sao Paulo coast) were followed for 1 yr. Two depths in
   the sub-tidal were examined at each site: 0.5-1.5 m and 2.5-4.0 m. These
   sites represented different habitats characterized by different levels
   of environmental stress. Fragments were produced by two methods: (1)
   biotic fragmentation (tissue isolated due to biologically caused
   lesions); in this case, primarily due to disease causing partial colony
   mortality in the colony; and (2) physical fragmentation (colonies broken
   into several pieces by storms, currents, or tides). Both modes involved
   incidental fragmentation, not actively directed by the parent colony. Of
   the 579 colonies monitored 6.9\% exhibited at least one mode of
   fragmentation over the period of 1 yr, producing 64 new ramets. The
   frequency of fragmentation, or total number of fragments produced from
   both modes of fragmentation, was independent of site and season, but not
   of depth. Significantly higher fragmentation was observed in shallower
   waters. This pattern could be explained by higher biotic fragmentation
   due to disease in these colonies. The frequency of colonies fragmenting
   by physical disturbance (storms) was found to be independent of site,
   depth, and season. At least 57\% of the population exhibited signs of
   partial colony mortality (lesions), which on the average affected <5\%
   of the total colony area. Partial colony mortality rarely resulted in
   ramet formation (9.7\%). Of this 9.7\%, 5.5\% developed fragments as a
   result of partial mortality due to disease and 4.1\% due to storm
   damage. A significant positive linear relationship was found between
   colony area and degree of partial mortality. When compared to other
   species of zoanthids, fragmentation plays an important role in asexual
   reproduction and potential contribution to population growth. It is not,
   however, as important as some other reproductive modes also utilized by
   this group.}},

Abstract = {{The species of Indo-West Pacific origin, Charybdis hellerii, was
   recently introduced to the Brazilian fauna. The size of individuals,
   sex-ratio, sexual maturity, molting and spawning period of this species
   was characterized in order to better understand their occupation,
   reproduction and development in invasive areas in the western tropical
   south Atlantic. The sex ratio was 1:1.2, and estimated size at sexual
   maturity was 35.0 mm of carapace width. Individuals in the intermolt
   phase were predominant, and no crabs in the process of ecdysis were
   captured. Ovigerous females were present throughout most of the year,
   with the peak of spawning activity during the winter. The studied
   population, characterized by moderate densities of adult, juvenile and
   ovigerous female specimens, and the temporal and spatial sampling along
   the western Atlantic, principally along the Brazilian coast, confirm the
   hypothesis that C. hellerii is well established in this area, and has
   arrived in recent times. The rapid expansion along the southwestern
   Atlantic Ocean as well as the potential relationships with other
   brachyuran species should be monitored in order to anticipate possible
   negative impacts.}},

Journal = {{CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST}},

Volume = {{133}},

Abstract = {{Host preference of the pine shoot beetle, Tomicus piniperda (L.), was
   investigated in two laboratory choice test studies using red pine (Pinus
   resinosa Ait.) (Pinaceae), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), and Scotch
   pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Host preference of parent adult beetles was
   evaluated using freshly cut, similarly sized logs in a wind tunnel.
   Parent beetles colonized Scotch pine logs significantly more often when
   given a choice of Scotch pine and either red pine or jack pine logs, but
   did not show a preference when presented with red pine and jack pine
   logs. Host preference of progeny adults was tested in a laboratory
   bioassay using current-year pine shoots. Shoot-feeding progeny adults
   initiated tunnels in jack pine shoots significantly more often than in
   Scotch pine and red pine shoots, and preferred Scotch pine over red pine
   shoots. S;hoots with diameters of 0.4-0.5 cm were attacked most
   frequently, regardless of species. Results suggest that the two North
   American pines are suitable hosts, but T. piniperda may be most likely
   to colonize Scotch pine, a European species. Efforts to detect or
   monitor T. piniperda populations in the Great Lakes and northeastern
   regions should focus an areas with abundant Scotch pine brood material.
   Progeny that emerge from brood material, however, may be as likely to
   shoot-feed in jack pine as in Scotch pine.}},

Abstract = {{The San Bias archipelago along the Atlantic coast of Panama is inhabited
   exclusively by Kuna Indians, who maintain the rights to exploit fishery
   resources in the area. Exportation of the spiny lobster, Pa,Panulirus
   argus, to Panama City constitutes one of the major sources of income for
   the Kuna economy. No published data exist on either the magnitude of the
   fishery or the life history and population dynamics of P. argus anywhere
   in Panama. We monitored P. argus export in two areas of Kuna Yala over a
   period spanning 16 months. We gathered data on weight, length, sex, and
   reproductive state of all lobsters comprising the catch of each day.
   Overall, the sex ratio of P. argus in the San Bias was nor significantly
   different from unity. However, there was a significant excess of fi
   males among smaller size classes (< 105 mm carapace length, CL), and of
   males among larger ones. The size of fil st reproduction for female P.
   argus in Kuna Yala is 67 mm CL as defined by the smallest size class
   including females with eggs or spermatophores, and 73 mm CL as defined
   by the smallest size class in which > 20\% of the females carried eggs.
   Reproductive females were present during all 9 months covered by our
   monitoring, with no clear peak in their proportion, indicating
   year-round reproduction. Average measured daily export of P. argus to
   Panama City was 11.7 Kg at one locality and 20.1 kg (in one of three
   outlets) at the other. Total estimated annual export was 18 t from these
   two localities and 92.48 t from the entire San Bias region. At 1998
   prices, the total income to the Kuna nation from lobster export was
   estimated as US\$ 620,388.00.
   Median carapace length of exported lobsters (83 mm in one locality, 77
   mm in the other) was only slightly larger than the size at first sexual
   maturity. Thus, slightly less than half of the export consists of
   pre-reproductive individuals. However, because Kunas only fish for
   lobster by fret-diving during the day, there is a sanctuary for lobster
   in depths > 20 m. Removal of small P. argus individuals and harvesting
   of shallow coral for the construction of sea walls are the greatest
   threats to the resource. As of 1998, the estimated yield per km(2) (67
   kg) was relatively high compared with other areas of the Caribbean.
   considering that no traps, nets, or SCUBA diving are employed in the
   fishery.}},

Abstract = {{We compare two approaches to designing and analyzing monitoring studies
   to assess chronic, local environmental impacts. Intervention Analysis
   (IA) compares Before and After time series at an Impact site; a special
   case is Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI), using comparison sites as
   covariates to reduce extraneous variance and serial correlation. IVRS
   (impact vs. reference sites) compares Impact and Control sites with
   respect to Before-After change, treating the sites as experimental
   units. The IVRS estimate of an ``effect{''} is the same as that of the
   simplest BACI (though not of others), but IVRS estimates error variance
   by variation among sites, while IA and BACI estimate it by variation
   over time.
   These approaches differ in goals, design, and models of the role of
   chance in determining the data. In IA and BACI, the goal is to determine
   change at the specific Impact site, so no Controls are needed. IA does
   not have controls and BACI's are not experimental controls, but
   covariates, deliberately chosen to be correlated with the Impact site.
   The goal given for IVRS is to compare hypothetical Impact and Control
   ``populations,{''} so the Controls are essential and are randomly
   chosen, perhaps with restrictions to make them independent of each other
   and (presumably) of Impact. IA and BACI inferences are model based:
   uncertainty arises from sampling error and natural temporal processes
   causing variation in the variable of concern (e.g., a species'
   abundance); these processes are modeled as the results of repeatable
   chance setups. IVRS inferences are design based: uncertainty arises from
   variation among sites, as well as the other two sources, and is modeled
   by the assumed random selection of Impact and Control sites, like the
   drawing of equiprobable numbers from a hat.
   We outline the formal analyses, showing that IVRS is simpler, and BACI
   more complex, than usually supposed. We then describe the principles and
   assumptions of IA and BACI, defining an ``effect{''} as the difference
   between what happened after the impact and what would have happened
   without it, and stressing the need to justify chance models as
   reasonable representations of human uncertainty. We respond to comments
   on BACI, some of which arise from misunderstanding of these principles.
   IVRS's design-based justification is almost always invalid in real
   assessments: the Impact site is not chosen randomly. We show that ``as
   if random{''} selection by ``Nature{''} is untenable and that an
   approximation to this, while a possibly useful guide, cannot be used for
   inference. We argue that, without literal random assignment of
   treatments to sites, IVRS can only be model based. Its design and
   analyses will then be different, using and allowing for correlation
   between sites. It is likely to have low power and requires strong
   assumptions that are difficult to check, so should be used only when IA
   or BACI cannot be used, e.g., when there are no Before data.}},

Abstract = {{The nonnative mudsnail Batillaria attramentaria was introduced to the
   west coast of North America in the early part of this century and has
   been displacing the native mudsnail Cerithidea californica on a
   marsh-by-marsh basis. We combined detailed, quantitative field data on
   this invader and its interactions with the native snail in an
   individual-based model that allowed us to address both general questions
   about the mechanism of displacement of native species and more specific
   concerns about detecting the trajectory and impact of the invasion. In
   empirically parameterized simulations the native snail was driven
   extinct within 55-70 yr after introduction of Batillaria, which closely
   matches direct field estimates. We then tested the relative importance
   of Batillaria's demonstrated advantages in parasitism resistance
   (top-down effect), exploitative competition (bottom-up effect), and
   mortality rate (demographic advantage) in driving its displacement of
   Cerithidea. With its demographic advantage maintained, but without its
   advantages in competition and parasitism, Batillaria still drove
   Cerithidea extinct within 90 yr. Only when Batillaria's mortality rate
   was set equal to that of Cerithidea could the native snail persist
   indefinitely, demonstrating this factor's overwhelming influence on the
   success of this invasion. The difference in mortality between the
   species was large relative to the other differences, but further
   simulations showed that the importance of this difference stems not just
   from its magnitude, but also from the sensitivity of this system to this
   demographic rate. Identification of the relative importance of
   mechanisms that contribute to an invader's success is one of the major
   benefits of such modeling efforts.
   To identify empirically measurable quantities that provide the earliest
   warning of impact on the native species, we tracked many population- and
   individual-level responses of Cerithidea to Batillaria's invasion,
   including population density, biomass, egg production, mean size,
   proportion of infected individuals, and individual growth rate, as well
   as availability of shared food resources. We used the empirically
   observed parameter values and an initial number of Batillaria invaders
   in these: simulations that guaranteed extinction of Cerithidea within 90
   yr. Despite a rapid initial increase in invader populations, all metrics
   for Cerithidea were slow to exhibit signs of impact. Most took at least
   25 yr from invasion to exhibit detectable changes, by which time the
   nonnative species was established at high densities (> 3000
   snails/m(2)). Cerithidea egg production was the fastest, most consistent
   response metric exhibiting declines within 20-25 yr after invasion in
   similar to 90\% of simulations. Difficulty in finding reliable, early
   warning metrics has crucial implications for how we should view and
   conduct monitoring programs and risk assessment analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to waterborne and foodborne pathogens can occur via drinking
   water (associated with fecal contamination), seafood (due to natural
   microbial hazards, toxins, or wastewater disposal) or fresh produce
   (irrigated or processed with contaminated water). Weather influences the
   transport and dissemination of these microbial agents via rainfall and
   runoff and the survival and/or growth through such factors as
   temperature. Federal and state laws and regulatory programs protect much
   of the U.S. population from waterborne disease; however, if climate
   variability increases, current and future deficiencies in areas such as
   watershed protection, infrastructure, and storm drainage systems will
   probably increase the risk of contamination events. Knowledge about
   transport processes and the fate of microbial pollutants associated with
   rainfall and snowmelt is key to predicting risks from a change in
   weather variability. Although recent studies identified links between
   climate variability and occurrence of microbial agents in water, the
   relationships need further quantification in the context of other
   stresses. In the marine environment as well, there are few studies that
   adequately address the potential health effects of climate variability
   in combination with other stresses such as overfishing, introduced
   species, and rise in sea level. Advances in monitoring are necessary to
   enhance early-warning and prevention capabilities. Application of
   existing technologies, such as molecular fingerprinting to track
   contaminant sources or satellite remote sensing to detect coastal algal
   blooms, could be expanded. This assessment recommends incorporating a
   range of future scenarios of improvement plans for current deficiencies
   in the public health infrastructure to achieve more realistic risk
   assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Migration monitoring stations (MMSs) were established to provide
   information on population trends of North American passerines. However,
   apart from inferring general origins of birds, there has been no way to
   delineate geographical catchment areas sampled by MMSs. The ability to
   resolve MMS catchment areas would greatly enhance our ability to link
   and constrain population declines to specific geographical areas and
   thereby focus conservation efforts. Here, we utilize stable-hydrogen
   (deltaD) and carbon (delta C-13) isotope values of rectrices of fall
   hatch-year (HY) and spring adult after-second year (ASY) Swainson's
   Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) moving through two MMSs in Canada to
   determine natal and molting catchment areas for those stations,
   Stable-carbon isotope signatures provided no information on geographical
   origins of birds. Conversely, deltaD signatures provided good
   latitudinal geographical control, and this was also supported by
   analysis of feathers from two other species, Gray-cheeked Thrush
   (Catharus minimus) and Harris' Sparrow (Zonotrichia querula), also known
   to breed and molt in northern regions. The 60 values of fall HY birds
   moving through Delta Marsh MMSs in Manitoba were more negative than
   those moving through Long Point MMSs in southern Ontario, clearly
   indicating more northwesterly origins. However, based on deltaD values
   alone, both MMSs sampled birds from broad catchment regions of the
   Canadian Boreal forest. The interpolated catchment area of the Delta MMS
   encompassed northwest Manitoba to northwestern Alberta. The interpolated
   catchment area of the Long Point MMS extended from north central Ontario
   and Quebec and into western Canada. The 60 values of birds moving
   northward in spring suggested that most ASY Swainson's Thrush molted at
   more southerly locations than their breeding sites, We show the
   stable-hydrogen isotope approach may be employed to significantly
   improve conventional observational techniques for avian population
   monitoring, and that MMSs provide a reliable means of associating
   population productivity with regional conservation issues.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory wetland microcosms were used to study treatment of atrazine,
   in irrigation runoff by a field-scale-constructed wetland under
   controlled conditions. Three experiments, in which 1 ppm atrazine was
   added to the water column of three wetland, one soil control, and one
   water control microcosm, were conducted. Atrazine dissipation from the
   water column and degradate formation (deethylatrazine {[}DEA];
   deisopropylatrazine {[}DIA]; and hydroxyatrazine {[}HA]) were monitored.
   Atrazine dissipation from the water column of wetland microcosms was
   biphasic. Less than 12\% of the atrazine applied to wetland microcosms
   remained in the water column on day 56. Atrazine degradates were
   observed in water and sediment, with HA the predominant degradate.
   Analysis of day 56 sediment samples indicated that a significant portion
   of the initial application was detected as the parent compound and HA.
   Most probable number (MPN) assays demonstrated that atrazine degrader
   populations were small in wetland sediment. Wetland microcosms were able
   to reduce atrazine concentration in the water column via sorption and
   degradation. Based on results from this study, it is hypothesized that
   plant uptake contributed to atrazine dissipation from the water column.}},

Abstract = {{Data from the so-called Level II Plots which were established within the
   frame of the Pan-European Programme for Intensive and Continuos
   Monitoring of Forest Ecosystems were used to quantify stand structure
   and species diversity by means of different indices. The calculations
   presented are based on species composition, spatial pattern as well as
   diameter and height distribution.
   The data assessed are suitable to calculate different measures of
   structural diversity, if a mapping of the stands is carried out. A
   comparison of the different indices by means of correlation analysis
   shows that there exist only few and weak correlations between species
   diversity of different vegetation layers, and between plant species
   diversity and diversity of stand structure, while among all the indices
   of stand structure a correlation exists. More complex indices of stand
   diversity perform quite well in characterising the specific situation.
   Mountain forests are compared with forests from lower elevations. They
   show a tendency towards irregular stand structures.
   No correlation between the naturalness of tree species composition and
   the calculated diversity indices can be found within the sample. (C)

Abstract = {{The U.S. EPA identified South Central Pennsylvania as a region having
   elevated radon levels. The thrust of this paper is to examine in some
   detail the TCS Industries, Inc., data base for eight Central
   Pennsylvania counties having a combined population of about 1.7 million
   people, which is 14\% of the state population.
   TCS has been making and analyzing radon measurements since 1986. During
   the period 1986 to 1999 more than 125,000 measurements were recorded in
   the TCS data base. The data consisted of analyzed results from four
   subsets. Results were from mail order charcoal canisters, bulk orders
   from RMP certified companies for their placement, wholesales to retail
   vendors, and also direct home placement of canisters, track detectors,
   and continuous radon,monitors. The data base for the right South Central
   Pennsylvania counties for the 13-y period consists of more than 27,000
   screening measurements from non-duplicated addresses.
   The results were assembled into three studies. The locations of the
   measurements were converted into individual latitude and longitude
   values. The data were divided into four blocks of concentrations from
   740 Bq m(-3) to over 4,440 Bq m(-3). The data were plotted on computer
   generated maps for South Central Pennsylvania. The plots indicated both
   hot spots and regions of relatively uniform chronic levels of 740 to
   1,480 Bq m(-3).
   An average value of the basement to first floor concentrations ratio was
   constructed from measurements mane by TCS for real estate purposes. The
   ratio represents 1,608 sets of simultaneous measurements of basements
   and first floor radon values above 37 Bq m(-3). The measurements were
   made by trained personnel performed under tile EPA protocol for closed
   house conditions. Tile ratio was 2.3 at 1 standard deviation of 0.05 of
   the mean.
   A third study assembled all of the data into first poor ration
   concentrations and separately for addresses with only basement valnes.
   The average concentration data within each of the eight counties were
   converted into the probability of fatal lung cancers and compared with
   occupational risk of fatal cancers for nuclear power plant workers. This
   study illustrates the importance of a continuing strong measurement
   program in South Central Pennsylvania.}},

Abstract = {{Personal exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) Were monitored for 176
   randomly selected inhabitants (25-55 years old) of Helsinki Metropolitan
   area as a part of the EAPOLIS (Air Pollution Exposure Distributions
   Within Adult Urban Populations in Europe) study between October 1996 and
   December 1997. NO2 measurements were 48-h averages collected by Palmes
   passive sampler tubes. Differences in personal exposures to NO2 were
   analyzed between subpopulations stratified by microenvironment,
   behavioral, socioeconomic and demographic factors. Factors significantly
   associated with differences in exposures to NO2 were home and work
   location, housing characteristics, traffic volume near home, season and
   keeping windows open at home. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
   (ETS) and use of gas stove were also associated with increased personal
   exposures, although only few participants had a gas stove in Helsinki
   and other gas appliances are non-existent. Single adults had higher
   average exposures to NO2. than married or cohabiting participants,
   suggesting differences in living conditions between these two groups.
   Increased education was associated with decreased exposures to NO2 and
   employed men were more exposed than unemployed men. Increased exposures
   to NO2 were not associated with age or occupational status in Helsinki.
   Thus, behavioral and sociodemographic factors may have significant
   impact on personal exposures to NO2 and should be considered in addition
   to environmental determinants in any monitoring program.}},

Abstract = {{Although facultative torpor has been observed in laboratory populations
   of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), it is widely
   believed that these animals remain normothermic throughout winter in the
   field. We monitored body temperatures (T-b) of 5 black-tailed prairie
   dogs in the field for about 100 days during winter and spring 1998-1999.
   All animals entered torpor during this period. Major torpor bouts
   averaged 140.5 h +/- 2.4 SD (range = 77.6-214.4) with a minimum T-b of
   19.0 +/- 3.6 degreesC. Minor torpor bouts averaged 46.2 +/- 20.9 h
   (9.5-98.5), with minimum T-b reaching 30.3 +/- 2.3 degreesC. There was
   no distinct relationship between ambient air temperature (T-a) and entry
   into torpor. All torpor bouts occurred following a sudden reduction in
   T-a, but not all sudden reductions in T-a induced torpor. Precipitation
   was not associated with entry into or arousal from torpor. Our study
   demonstrates that facultative torpor occurs in free-ranging black-tailed
   prairie dogs in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Maternally inherited bacteria of the genus Wolbachia can cause
   cytoplasmic incompatibility resulting in the developmental arrest of
   early embryos. Previous studies have shown that both single- and
   superinfections of Wolbachia naturally occur in populations of Aedes
   albopictus (Skuse). Here. we report crossing experiments using three
   infection types occurring in Ae. albopictus: uninfected,
   single-infected, and superinfected individuals. Crosses were monitored
   over the lifetime of adults to detect possible effects of host age on
   cytoplasmic incompatibility levels and infection virulence. Both single-
   and superinfections induced high levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility
   throughout the lifetime of Ae. albopictus, demonstrating that both the
   single- and superinfections are well adapted for invasion of Ae.
   albopictus populations. Superinfected females were the longest lived and
   had the highest oviposition rate, whereas in males. uninfected
   individuals were the longest lived. These latter results demonstrate the
   need for additional experiments to better elucidate Wolbachia effects on
   host fitness in addition to cytoplasmic incompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{An objective, non-invasive technique was developed for identifying
   individual black rhino from their footprints (spoor). Digital images
   were taken of left hind spoor from tracks (spoor pathways) of 15 known
   black rhino in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Thirteen landmark points
   were manually placed on the spoor image and from them, using customized
   software, a total of 77 measurements (lengths and angles) were
   generated. These were subjected to discriminant and canonical analyses.
   Discriminant analysis of spoor measurements from all 15 known animals,
   employing the 30 measurements with the highest F-ratio values, gave very
   close agreement between assigned and predicted classification of spoor.
   For individual spoor, the accuracy of being assigned to the correct
   group varied from 87\% to 95\%. For individual tracks, the accuracy
   level was 88\%. Canonical analyses were based on the centroid plot
   method, which does not require pre-assigned grouping of spoor or tracks.
   The first two canonical variables were used to generate a centroid plot
   with 95\% confidence ellipses in the test space. The presence or absence
   of overlap between the ellipses of track pairs allowed the
   classification of the tracks. Using a new `reference centroid value'
   technique, the level of accuracy was high (94\%) when individual tracks
   were compared against whole sets (total number of spoor for each rhino)
   but low (35\%) when tracks were compared against each other. Since
   tracks with fewer spoor were more likely to be misclassified, track
   sizes were then artificially increased by summing smaller tracks for the
   same rhino. The modified tracks in a pairwise comparison gave an
   accuracy of 93\%. The advantages, limitations and practical applications
   of the spoor identification technique are discussed in relation to
   censusing and monitoring black rhino populations.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, focus has been directed towards the use of microorganisms
   as biological control agents to combat fungal disease, as an alternative
   to chemical fungicides. Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 is one bacterial
   strain that has been demonstrated to promote plant growth by biocontrol
   of pathogenic fungi. To understand the mode of action of this bacterium,
   information regarding its localization and metabolic activity on plants
   is important. In this study, a gfp/luxAB-tagged derivative of P.
   fluorescens SBW25, expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and
   bacterial luciferase, was monitored during colonization of wheat
   starting from seed inoculation. Since bacterial luciferase is dependent
   on cellular energy reserves for phenotypic expression, metabolically
   active cells were detected using this marker. In contrast, the stable
   GFP fluorescence phenotype was used to detect the cells independently of
   their metabolic status. The combination of these two markers enabled P.
   fluorescens SBW25 cells to be monitored on wheat plants to determine
   their specific location and metabolic activity. Studies on homogenized
   wheat plant parts demonstrated that the seed was the preferred location
   of P. fluorescens SBW25 during the 65-day time period studied, but the
   leaves and roots were also colonized. Interestingly, the bacteria were
   also found to be metabolically active on all plant parts examined. In
   situ localization of P. fluorescens SBW25 using a combination of
   different microscopic techniques confirmed the preference for the cells
   to colonize specific regions of the seed. We speculate that the
   colonization pattern of P. fluorescens SBW25 can be linked to the
   mechanism of protection of plants from fungal infection.}},

Abstract = {{The gfp (green fluorescent protein) gene has previously been used to
   construct a variety of reporter plasmids for Cram-positive bacteria for
   bacterial localization and gene expression studies. When a native
   red-shifted gfp variant (gfp3) was cloned into an expression vector
   using the P-xyn promoter and used to transform the soil-borne pathogen
   Listeria monocytogenes, only a small proportion of the population was
   seen to fluoresce when examined by epifluorescence microscopy. When the
   P-xyn promoter was replaced with the P-xyn promoter, with accompanying
   modification of the translation initiation region of the gfp3 gene, a
   homogeneously fluorescent population of cells was obtained. When
   expressed in other Gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus
   aureus and Bacillus subtilis, the translationally enhanced gene also
   resulted in high-level and homogeneous GFP production within the
   bacterial population. High-level expression of these reporter constructs
   in L. monocytogenes was evaluated to determine if it had any detrimental
   biological effect during intracellular infection of eukaryotic cell
   lines. The gfp(3+)Listeria were found to invade equally as well as the
   wild-type cells; showing that these expression systems can be used to
   monitor the bacterium in natural environments. Based on these results,
   similar translationally enhanced vectors were also developed using
   unstable GFP3 variants, which retain their short-half life
   characteristics in L. monocytogenes and therefore can be used as a
   sensitive monitor of gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of endophytic bacterial populations of potato (Solanum
   tuberosum cv Desiree) was assessed using a combination of dilution
   plating of plant macerates followed by isolation and characterization of
   isolates, and direct PCR-DGGE on the basis of DNA extracted from plants.
   The culturable endophytic bacterial communities detected in potato stem
   bases as well as in roots were in most cases on the order 10(3) to 10(5)
   CFU g(-1) of fresh plant tissue. Dilution plating revealed that a range
   of bacterial types dominated these populations. Dominant isolates fell
   into the alpha and gamma subgroups of the Proteobacteria, as well as in
   the Flavobacterium/Cytophaga group. Different representatives of the
   Firmicutes were also found. The most frequently isolated strains (>5\%
   of the total) were characterized as different Pseudomonas spp.
   (including P. aureofaciens, P. corrugata, and P, putida), Agrobacterium
   radiobacter, Stenotrophomonas malruphilia, and FIuvobacterium
   resinovorans, using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and/or
   sequencing of their partial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Other
   Proteobacteria or Firmicutes were also found, albeit infrequently, and
   mainly in potato stem tissue. The fate of three putative potato
   endophytes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacillus sp., and Sphingomonas
   paucimobilis, was monitored following their release into potato plants
   via injection, via root dipping, or via the soil. Following stem
   injection, the S, maltophilia and Bacillus inoculants could be tracked
   over time periods of, respectively, 22 and 1 day(s) by dilution plating
   as well as via PCR-DGGE. However, only S. maltophilia was able to
   colonize, and persist in, plant tissue from soil or dipped roots. S.
   paucimobilis was never recovered from the plant irrespective of the mode
   of introduction. The diversity of the indigenous bacterial flora
   associated with potato was then monitored via PCR-DGGE. The patterns
   obtained revealed the existence of bacterial communities of limited
   complexity, with communities from potato stems typically differing from
   those from stem peel and roots. Evidence was obtained for the endophytic
   occurrence of a range of organisms falling into the alpha, beta, and
   gamma subgroups of the Proteobacteria as well as in the Firmicutes.
   Several of the sequences found matched those from isolates, suggesting
   that the molecular evidence reported culturable organisms. However, a
   number of sequences did not have matching sequences from isolates,
   suggesting that non-culturable or as-yet-uncultured endophytic organisms
   were being detected.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of salmonid populations often involves annual redd counts,
   but the validity of this method has seldom been evaluated. We conducted
   redd counts of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus in two streams in
   northern Idaho to address four issues: (1) relationships between adult
   escapements and redd counts; (2) interobserver variability in redd
   counts; (3) sources of interobserver variability; and (4) temporal and
   spatial variation in spawning activity. We found that estimated adult
   escapements and redd counts were strongly correlated on a logarithmic
   scale, but both sources of data probably contained large estimation or
   observation errors. In particular, redd counts varied significantly
   among observers in replicate counting trials. Observer counts ranged
   between 28\% and 254\% of the best estimates of actual redd numbers.
   Counting errors included both omissions and false identifications.
   Correlations between counting errors and redd and habitat
   characteristics were highly variable and provided limited insights into
   potential causes of sampling error. Finally, we found significant
   spatial and temporal variability in spawning activity, which should be
   considered in establishing index areas for redd counts and the timing of
   counts. Our results suggest substantial improvements are needed to make
   redd counts and unbiased estimates of adult escapement more useful for
   population monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Correlations between abundance of organisms and their habitat have often
   been used as a measure of the importance of particular habitat features.
   However, experimental manipulation of the habitat provides a more
   unequivocal estimate of its importance. In this study we quantified how
   fish communities on small patch reefs covaried with changes in benthic
   cover habitat features. A random sample of small patch reefs was
   selected and both fish abundance and habitat measures recorded.
   Naturally occurring patch reefs could be classed into three habitat
   types based on their benthic cover. Reefs dominated by massive soft
   corals were the most abundant (50\%), followed by those dominated by
   rock and soft corals in equal proportions (36\%), then reefs dominated
   by branching corals (14\%). Fish assemblages differed between the reef
   types. Communities on soft-coral-dominated and rock/soft-coral-dominated
   patch reefs formed a continuum of species responses correlated with
   degree of soft coral cover. In contrast, branching-coral-dominated reefs
   were occupied by a more discrete set of species. We tested the role of
   soft corals in contributing to this pattern by experimentally reducing
   soft coral cover on patch reefs from a baseline level of similar to 67\%
   to similar to 33\% and similar to6\%, and monitoring the experiment over
   2 years. Contrary to expectations derived from the correlative data, and
   in contrast with previous manipulations of hard corals, soft-coral
   disturbance did not generate any corresponding changes in the fish
   assemblage. This ``negative{''} result indicated that the quality and
   heterogeneity of habitat generated by soft corals on patch reefs was
   indistinguishable from equivalent-sized habitat patches formed by bare
   rock alone. Nevertheless, because soft corals are living organisms they
   have the potential to generate indirect effects by interacting with
   other organisms such as hard corals. In the long-term, we hypothesize
   that biotic interactions between habitat forming organisms might affect
   composition of fish assemblages on patch reefs.}},

Abstract = {{Histochemical staining, P-glucuronidase (GUS) activity, or placing roots
   on agar were methods used to characterize interactions between the
   pathogenic fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, and the
   nonpathogenic biocontrol F. oxysporum strain 70T01 with respect to
   colonization behaviors, interaction sites, and population densities on
   tomato roots. Mycelia of strain 70T01, a genetic transformant expressing
   stable GUS activity, hygromycin B resistance, and effective disease
   control, were localized in epidermal and cortex cell layers of tomato
   roots in a discontinuous and uneven pattern. In contrast mycelia of F.
   oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici were found in the vascular bundles. Thus,
   direct interactions between the two fungi likely happen in the root
   surface cell layers. Colonization density of strain 70T01 was related to
   the inoculation density but decreased with distance from the inoculation
   site. Host defense reactions, including increased cell wall thickness or
   papilla deposits, were adjacent to 70T01 hyphae. Experiments done in
   soil showed that strain 70T01 densities in roots were highest at
   inoculation zones and barely detectable for root segments more than 2 cm
   away from the inoculation sites. F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici
   densities were lowest at 70T01 inoculation zones and highest (>10 times)
   where strain 70T01 was not directly applied. Newly elongating roots
   where strain 70T01 did not reach were available for infection by the
   pathogen. The higher strain 70T01 density was always found when he
   plants were simultaneously infected by F. oxysporum f. sp, lycopersici,
   suggesting that F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici has as much influence in
   predisposing the plant to colonization by strain 70T01 as strain 70T01
   has on providing disease protection against the pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{Cytogenetic variation was analyzed in daughter populations of Scotch
   pine from the Voronezh Forestry. The dependence of the variation on the
   method of seed collection (the commercial method; the population method,
   when seeds from a group of phenotypically normal trees in the center of
   the forest are collected; or the individual method, when seeds from plus
   trees are collected) and on the ecological situation at the sampling
   site (ecologically safe conditions or chemical or physical pollution)
   was studied. The parameters of the mitotic rate and mitotic pathology
   were estimated at 7-9\% and up to 5\%, respectively. These parameters
   may be considered as normal when estimating the quality of seed progeny
   in pine and when pine is used as a test object in cytogenetic
   monitoring. The limits of variation and the spectra of cytogenetic
   characteristics allowing the pine populations to maintain their
   homeostasis were also determined.}},

Abstract = {{Poor water quality is discussed as a major factor causing a decline of
   brown trout populations in Swiss rivers. For our study we have chosen a
   river in the Swiss midlands, where the brown trout population has
   decreased dramatically during the last 10 yr and where feral fish have
   shown distinctive pathological alterations. The objective of our study
   was to investigate whether river water may be responsible for impaired
   fish health leading to an increased mortality in the river. In an active
   monitoring program, groups of brown and rainbow trout were exposed to
   polluted river water for 24 mo. Fish held in tap water served as a
   reference. Mortality, macroscopic and histopathologic changes, and
   infectious agents were investigated. Compared with the reference group,
   high mortality rates and severe pathological alterations of the inner
   organs were observed in fish held in river water. Especially gills,
   liver and kidney of these fish showed significantly higher changes than
   fish from tap water. These changes were dominated by degenerative and
   inflammatory reactions. Additionally, several infectious agents were
   diagnosed in fish exposed to river water. The most important findings
   were furunculosis and proliferative kidney disease. Brown trout seemed
   to be more sensitive than rainbow trout to environmental stress and
   infectious agents.}},

Abstract = {{Twelve wetlands (7 recently restored: 5 reference) in central and
   southern Minnesota were monitored during the 1998 breeding season to
   assess colonization of recently restored wetlands by amphibians, compare
   the amphibian fauna to that of reference wetlands and identify important
   factors influencing the probability of colonization. Eight amphibian
   species rapidly colonized recently restored wetlands and established
   breeding populations. Reference wetlands were inhabited by twelve
   species, including four not found in restored wetlands (Ambystoma
   laterale. Notophthalmus viridescens. Pseudacris crucifer and Rana
   clamitans). Most local habitat variables, such as water chemistry or
   aquatic vegetation cover, were not influential in determining species
   richness patterns in recently restored wetlands. Size and spatial
   isolation of restored wetlands, however, were important predictors of
   species richness. Habitat suitability also influenced the probability of
   colonization for some species. The results of this study indicate that
   restored wetlands are valuable habitat for at least a subset of the
   amphibian fauna of this region and that wetland size, isolation and
   habitat suitability all influence colonization success.}},

Abstract = {{Constructed wetlands are built because they can act as sinks fur many
   pollutants, thereby protecting the water quality of downstream
   ecosystems. The treatment performance is generally assessed using mass
   balance calculations. Along with the mass balance approach, we compared
   the metal content of populations of a common pond snail (Helisoma
   trivolvis Say) collected upstream and downstream of a 3-year-old
   constructed wetland. Snails were collected in early May, June, and
   August 1998. At the same time, water samples for particulate and
   dissolved metals were taken every 3 days for the duration of the
   experiment. Overall, the wetland retained most dissolved metals,
   including Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb, but released dissolved As.
   However, the wetland released particulate Fe and Mn. With the exception
   of Zn, the metal concentrations of the downstream snails were on average
   higher than those measured in the upstream population. The higher metal
   content of downstream snails was likely related to the significant
   export of particulate metals by the wetland, despite the overall
   retention of dissolved metals. This study points to the need for
   biological as well as chemical monitoring to determine the treatment
   efficiency and toxicological risk associated with constructed wetlands.}},

Abstract = {{Human mercury contamination can be monitored through hair analysis of
   mercury's inorganic and organic form as methylmercury (Me-Hg). Hair
   total mercury and Me-Hg were studied in a Negro River fish-eating
   population in relation to age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). This
   riverbank population eats fish at least twice a day and is exposed to
   high levels of Me-Hg. Total mercury ranged from 1.51 mug/g to 59.01
   mug/g, with only 21\% of the sampled population having Hg concentration
   of less than 10 mug/g hair. The mean percentage of Me-Hg was 71.3\%
   (range 34\% to 100\%) of the total mercury in hair. No statistically
   significant differences were found in regard to age groups (children and
   adults) or BMI. However, women had significantly lower total mercury in
   hair than men, but the percentage of Me-Hg was not significantly
   different. Women in fertile age (15-40 years) had hair total mercury
   ranging from 1.65-32.63 mug/g, and 65\% in this sub-group had hair
   mercury above 10 mug/g hair. The percentage of Me-Hg concentration in
   hair of this freshwater, fish-eating population is comparable to
   populations eating ocean fish from different parts of the world and does
   not seem to be affected by age, gender, and BMI.}},

   (Carpodacus Mexicanus) of North America. In this paper, we present
   findings from two complementary studies designed to clarify annual and
   seasonal trends of MG infections in House Finches from the northeastern
   United States. The first was a field study of House Finches common to
   urban and residential habitat from Mercer County, New Jersey. We
   documented conjunctivitis in 11\% (188/1,651) of the birds examined.
   Conjunctivitis prevalence in House Finches ranged from 0 to 43\% per
   month, and exhibited marked seasonal fluctuation (elevations during fail
   and winter months and lower disease prevalence during the breeding
   season). There was excellent intermethod agreement on disease prevalence
   when measured by either presence of physical signs (conjunctivitis) or
   MG infection (kappa = 0.75). During the peak of the breeding season
   (April through June), conjunctivitis was present in a greater proportion
   of males lacking a cloacal protuberance than males with a cloacal
   protuberance (P < 0.01), but was similar between breeding and
   nonbreeding females. The second study, a volunteer survey, revealed the
   proportion of northeastern U.S. monitoring sires with at least one
   diseased House Finch each month ranged from a peak of 59\% (August 1995)
   to a minimum of 12\% (July 1999). Subsequent to the epidemic peak of
   disease in 1995, a series of recurring cycles occurred, with elevations
   in those proportions noted in late fall and winter and minima during the
   breeding season. Mycoplasmal conjunctivitis now appears endemic among
   House Finches of that region and demonstrates dynamics consistent with
   annual Variation in host density.}},

Abstract = {{monitored the apparent survival of territorial and nonterritorial
   Pacific Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis fulva) for 20 consecutive nonbreeding
   seasons at a wintering ground within Bellows Air Force Station (BAFS) on
   the eastern shore of Oahu, Hawaii. Territorial birds were especially
   site-faithful from season to season, and each surviving individual
   reoccupied the same territory held in previous seasons. On average,
   territorial birds were resighted for about twice as many postbanding
   seasons (4.2) as nonterritorial birds (1.8). Open-population modeling
   indicated that apparent survival varied by age and territorial status.
   Our most parsimonious model estimated apparent annual survival rates in
   territorial plovers as 0.90 for young birds (age determined from
   retained juvenal primaries) from their first through their second
   wintering season, and 0.80 for adults over numerous seasons. For
   nonterritorial plovers, the corresponding values were 0.82 and 0.67,
   respectively. Despite lower apparent survival in nonterritorial plovers,
   it remains uncertain whether nonterritoriality actually results in
   shorter life spans. Some surviving nonterritorial birds may have gone
   undetected (detection probability of 0.70) because of permanent
   emigration from the study area. Given strong site-fidelity of
   territorial birds and the relative certainty of detecting them
   (probability = 1.0), we regarded the disappearance of a p]over from its
   territory as an indicator of mortality. From last-recorded sightings, we
   concluded that territorial birds died with about equal frequency during
   the nonbreeding. and breeding seasons. Because the latter is of much
   shorter duration, time-relative hazards were greatest while birds were
   away from the wintering grounds. Winter mortality was caused by
   accidents (collisions with overhead wires and other obstructions), and
   probable predation by owls. We estimated mean additional life expectancy
   among territorial plovers at 5.1 years for first-year birds, and 4.5
   years for unknown-age adults. Thtr oldest known-age individual was a
   male that lived 13 years 10 months; in adults of uncertain ages, one
   male survived to a minimum age of 18 years 10 months, and two females to
   at least 17 years 10 months. Pacific Golden-Plovers wintering at BAFS,
   especially territorial birds, demonstrated relatively high rates of
   apparent survival combined with adaptability for coexistence with humans
   in an urban environment.}},

Abstract = {{The successful removal of rodents from islands around New Zealand has
   enabled translocation of rare species of lizards to new sites within
   their former range. Four species of skinks were translocated to Korapuki
   Island, Mercury Islands, New Zealand: Cyclodina alani, C. oliveri, C.
   whitakeri and Oligosoma suteri. Responses of three of the lizard species
   to release were predicted using a deterministic population model then
   compared with the actual performance of wild populations. The population
   models predicted that if populations of about 30 C. whitakeri and O.
   suteri were released, C. whitakeri would be increasing by 7\% p.a. and
   O. suteri would be increasing by over 35\% p.a, during year five. If 20
   C. alani were released, the population could be increasing by 70\% p.a.
   during year five. Population expansions are being recorded for all three
   species, but observed population increases were lower than those
   predicted for two species, partly because of low catchability of
   immature lizards. The lowest rate of increase (up to 7\% p.a.) was for
   C. whitakeri. Low rates of population expansion found in species such as
   C. whitakeri raise a conundrum: the rarer a species is, and the lower
   its annual reproductive output, the larger the number of individuals
   that may be required for translocations to succeed. Translocations may
   be regarded as successful when new populations are self-sustaining and
   comprised only of locally born animals. Despite the populations
   increasing, it may not be possible to claim success far the three
   intensively studied species on Korapuki Island until at least 20 years
   after release. This is because of longevity of the founders, which are
   still being caught up to 12 years after release. Extreme longevity, and
   hence prolonged post-release monitoring, is likely to be a recurrent
   problem for translocations of rare lizards. O 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The Fijian crested iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis) has a severely
   restricted distribution and is secure on only one island, the Iguana
   Sanctuary island of Yadua Taba. Line transect surveys of sleeping
   iguanas at night on Yadua Taba were used to assess the feasibility of
   this technique for population surveys of other islands, and for
   monitoring iguana numbers during the recovery process on islands
   selected for habitat restoration. Our surveys on Yadua Taba revealed
   population densities of 196 iguanas per hectare in forest habitat. On
   the smaller island of Monuriki, where crested iguana sightings were
   frequent in the early 1980s, the population density estimate was nine
   iguanas per hectare for the largest stand of forest. The total
   population estimate for Yadua Taba is > 6000 iguanas, while for Monuriki
   it is < 100. Vegetation surveys of these islands suggest that the
   abundance of the herbivorous crested iguana reflects the relative
   abundance of food trees present, with 63\% of forest trees on Yadua Taba
   being edible species, compared to only 2\% on Monuriki. Although both
   islands are uninhabited and have no introduced predators, Monuriki has
   been subjected to over three decades of intensive goat grazing and
   regular dry season burning. The combination of goats and fire may have
   reduced the survivorship and recruitment of iguana food tree species,
   several of which are known to be fire sensitive. Selective browsing by
   goats on the seedlings of palatable tree species on Monuriki has
   resulted in the competitive release of unpalatable species, inedible to
   both goats and crested iguanas. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We radio monitored a hunted, sexually segregated grizzly bear (Ursus
   arctos) population and an unhunted, unsegregated population for
   demographics and constructed a stage- and age-classified matrix model to
   test for the effects of adult male mortality and resulting sexual
   segregation on population growth and persistence. Population parameters
   in the model were adult female survival, subadult female survival,
   offspring survival, probability of litter sizes, and probability of
   unsuccessful pregnancy. The last three parameters were affected by adult
   male mortality and segregation, the others were not. We compared
   population growth with and without effects of hunting by holding adult
   female and subadult female survival constant and by using hunted and
   unhunted values for offspring survival, litter size, and pregnancy.
   Population growth (Lambda) showed the greatest elasticity for adult
   survival, subadult survival, offspring survival, litter size, and
   unsuccessful pregnancy, in that order. This corresponds with observed
   anti-infanticide tactics (sexual segregation) by adult females to
   maximize their fitness. The hunted population decreased at a rate of
   0.99 whereas the simulated, unhunted population increased at a rate of
   1.05. The hunted population was much more susceptible to population
   extinction. Under demographic stochasticity mean time to extinction was
   32 years in the hunted population and 110 years in the unhunted
   population. Under environmental stochasicity mean time to extinction was
   21 years in the hunted population and 43 years in the unhunted
   population. We suggest that sexual segregation caused by hunting
   resident adult males can result in population decline and can even
   contribute to rapid population extinctions when numbers are small. (C)

Abstract = {{Delphinium montanum is a larkspur endemic to the Pyrenees. It has c.
   4000 individuals and is classified as vulnerable following the IUCN
   categories. Pollination ecology results demonstrated that it is strictly
   dependent on pollinator activity (mainly bumblebees) to set seeds.
   Genetic diversity estimated by allozyme variation at 7 loci showed quite
   high levels of variation related to its polyploidy. Predation by
   Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra pyrenaica), first detected in
   1993, caused a continuous loss of > 90\% of seed set in a protected
   area. The maintenance of high genetic diversity suggests the buffer
   effect of polyploidy and seed bank strategy to counter animal grazing,
   but long-term effects on conservation are expected. These results
   stressed: (1) the need for a plan to monitor this animal-plant
   interaction; and (2) the need to monitor closely the population number
   of individuals of certain protected animal species in Natural Reserves,
   particularly if ecological competition has been disturbed by human
   intervention. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Symphyotrichum laurentianum, the Gulf of St. Lawrence Aster, is an
   endemic aster of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and the Magdalene
   Islands. It is considered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered
   Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) to be of special concern in Canada and to
   be critically imperiled in Prince Edward Island. One goal of this study
   was to test germination to clarify the relationship between dormancy and
   germination in this species. Seeds germinated in culture media had an
   overall mean percent germination of 68.37\% whereas seeds germinated in
   soil had an overall mean percent germination of 17.38\%. Kinetin
   supplements positively affected germination rates. However, these
   kinetin supplements eventually led to abnormal morphological development
   in S. laurentianum seedlings. Cold treatments had no significant effects
   on the percent germination of S. laurentianum seeds. Micropropagation of
   this type of explant and reintroduction should therefore be considered
   by Prince Edward Island as potential techniques for the conservation of
   S. laurentianum on Prince Edward Island. A complementary goal of this
   study was to survey the Blooming Point and Covehead sites to update the
   population statuses of S. laurentianum within the Prince Edward Island
   National Park. The size of the S. laurentianum population at Covehead
   Pond during 1999 was very similar to the population size at this site in
   1993. Population sizes showed more fluctuation at Blooming Point between
   1993 and 1999. No asters were found in the East Marsh in 1999; however,
   there was a large increase in population numbers at the Dune Slack site,
   Seeds of S. laurentianum appear to respond well to tissue culture.
   Annual monitoring of S. laurentianum populations should also occur to
   ensure appropriate management of this species on Prince Edward Island.}},

Abstract = {{The life cycle of Calanus finmarchicus in the lower St. Lawrence estuary
   is described based on observations of female egg production rate,
   population stage abundance, and chlorophyll a biomass collected over 7
   years (1991-1997) at a centrally located monitoring station. The mean
   seasonal pattern shows maximum abundance of females in May, but peak
   population egg production rate and naupliar (N3-N6) abundance occur in
   early July just after onset of the late spring - early summer
   phytoplankton bloom. The population stage structure is characterized by
   low summer abundance of early copepodite stages C1-C3 and high stage C5
   abundance in autumn. Between 1994 and 1997, there was important
   interannual variation in both timing (up to 1 month) and amplitude
   (five- to eight-fold) of population reproduction. Patterns of seasonal
   increase of C5 abundance in autumn suggest interannual variations of
   both timing and magnitude of deep upstream advection of this
   overwintering stage. Thus, the main features of C. finmarchicus
   population dynamics in the central lower St. Lawrence Estuary are (i)
   late reproduction resulting from food limitation prior to the onset of
   the summer phytoplankton bloom, (ii) probable export of early
   developmental stages during summer, and (iii) advection into the central
   lower St. Lawrence Estuary of overwintering stage C5 in autumn from
   downstream regions. These results support the hypothesis that
   circulation, mainly driven by discharge from the St. Lawrence River and
   its tributaries, is a key factor governing population dynamics of C.
   finmarchicus in this region.}},

Abstract = {{In 1966 the gray wolf (Canis lupus) was regarded as functionally extinct
   in Norway and Sweden (the Scandinavian peninsula). In 1978 the first
   confirmed reproduction on the peninsula in 14 years was recorded. During
   20 successive winters, from 1978-1979 to 1997-1998, the status,
   distribution, and dynamics of the wolf population were monitored by
   snow-tracking as a cooperative Swedish-Norwegian project. After the 1978
   reproduction in northern Sweden, all new pairs and packs were located in
   south-central parts of the Scandinavian peninsula. Between 1983 and 1990
   wolves reproduced each year except 1986, but in only one territory.
   There was no population growth during this period and the population
   never exceeded 10 animals. In 1991 reproduction was recorded in two
   territories. After that there were multiple reproductions each year and
   the population started growing. In 1998 there were 50-72 wolves and six
   reproducing packs on the peninsula. Between 1991 and 1998 the annual
   growth rate was 1.29 +/- 0.035 (mean +/- SD). A minimum of 25 litters
   were born during the study period. The early-winter size of packs
   reproducing for the first time was 6.2 +/- 1.4 wolves (n = 9), and this
   decreased with time during the study. The size of packs that had
   reproduced more than once was 6.4 +/- 1.8 wolves (n = 12), and this
   increased with time over the study period. All but 1 of 30 reported wolf
   deaths were human-caused. The annual mortality rate was 0.13 +/- 0.11,
   and this decreased with time during the study period. The minimum
   dispersal distance was 323 +/- 212 km for males and 123 +/- 67 km for
   females. Of 10 new wolf territories where breeding occurred, only 1
   bordered other, existing territories. The distance from newly
   established wolf pairs to the nearest existing packs was 119 +/- 73 km.
   Simulation of population growth based on known reproductions and
   mortalities showed a close similarity to the results from population
   censuses up to the mid-1990s. To what extent this population is
   genetically isolated is at present unclear.}},

Abstract = {{The endangered Hawaiian monk seal breeds at six locations in the
   northwestern Hawaiian Islands. To determine whether significant genetic
   differentiation exists among these sites, we used microsatellite loci to
   examine the monk seal population structure at the five largest breeding
   colonies. Of 27 loci isolated from other seal species, only 3 were
   polymorphic in an initial screening of one individual from each breeding
   site. Only two alleles were found at each of these 3 loci in samples of
   46-108 individuals. This extremely low variation is consistent with
   other measures of genetic variability in this species and is probably
   the result of a recent severe population bottleneck, combined with a
   long-term history of small population sizes. Although the smallest monk
   seal subpopulation in this study (Kure Atoll) showed some evidence of
   heterozygote deficit, possibly indicative of inbreeding, the next
   smallest (Pearl and Hermes Reef) had an apparent excess of heterozygous
   individuals. Genetic differentiation was detected between the two
   subpopulations at extreme ends of the range (Kure and French Frigate
   Shoals). This trend was significant only at the microsatellite locus for
   which we had the largest sample size (Hg6.3: R-ST = 0.206, p = 0.002;
   allelic goodness of fit G(h) = 15.412, p < 0.005). French Frigate Shoals
   is the source population for translocated animals that have been
   released primarily at Kure Atoll. Differentiation between these sites
   consisted of allele frequency differences (with the same allele
   predominant in each location at all three loci), rather than the
   preservation of alternative alleles. Although the translocations have
   had positive demographic effects, we recommend continued genetic
   monitoring of both the source and recipient populations because
   translocated individuals are now entering the breeding population.}},

Abstract = {{The number of habitat conservation plans (HCP) has risen dramatically
   since the first plan was written over 18 years ago. Until recently, no
   studies have quantitatively investigated the scientific foundations
   underlying these documents. As part of a larger study of HCPs, we
   examined 43 plans primarily to assess the availability and use of
   scientific data and secondarily to determine the extent of involvement
   by, and influence of, independent scientists within the process.
   Specifically, our analysis focused on five key steps taken when an HCP
   is developed: assessing status of a species, determining take,
   predicting the project effects, mitigating for those effects, and
   monitoring of take and mitigation. In general, we found that the
   preparers of HCPs utilized existing scientific information fairly well,
   with 60\% of plans not missing any available information described by
   our study as ``starkly necessary.{''} The most common types of
   underutilized available data included those describing the influence of
   stochastic processes and habitat quality or quantity on species
   persistence. For many species, however, data on biology or status simply
   did not exist, as demonstrated by the fact that we could locate
   quantitative population estimates for only 10\% of the species.
   Furthermore, for 42\% of the species examined we had insufficient data
   and analysis to determine clearly how predicted take might effect the
   population. In many cases, mitigation measures proposed to offset take
   frequently addressed the most important local threats to the species
   with moderately reliable strategies. Species with monitoring programs
   rated as sufficient had plans that proposed to collect a greater amount
   of ``quantitative{''} data than did those programs rated insufficient.
   Finally, when species ``experts{''} were consulted, plan quality was
   generally higher. Overall, available scientific information in a
   majority of categories was fairly well utilized, but for many species
   additional studies and more indepth analysis were required to provide
   adequate support for issuance of an incidental take permit.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation strategies for forest-breeding. Neotropical migratory birds
   focus on the identification and preservation of source habitats. In
   sources, populations maintain relatively high levels of reproductive
   success, whereas in sinks, reproductive success is consistently below
   net replacement rate. In agricultural regions of the midwestern United
   States, forest patches of various sizes appear to act as sinks for
   Neotropical migrants. In 1994-1996 I monitored Wood Thrush (Hylocichla
   mustelina) nests in four forest patches in an agricultural landscape in
   northern Indiana. Given the prevailing estimates of adult and juvenile
   survival, I report productivity data that show substantial annual
   variation and that are sufficient to suggest the maintenance of temporal
   sources. Indeed, some Wood Thrush populations may act as source habitats
   in regions with relatively high levels of Brown-beaded Cowbird
   (Molothrys ater) parasitism and nest predation because pairs produce
   multiple clutches and have the ability to fledge cowbirds and their own
   young from parasitized nests. My results and those from other studies of
   Wood Thrushes in landscapes with fragmented forests illustrate the
   variable ways in which source-sink dynamics are affected by habitat
   fragmentation. In some agricultural regions, populations in small forest
   patches may act as sources for Wood Thrushes and may be a legitimate
   focus of conservation efforts aimed at some migratory songbirds.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring differences in lymphocytes during neonatal development
   constitutes a key to understanding the developing piglet's natural and
   pathological immune responses. A survey was conducted to accumulate
   information on the phenotype of lymphocytes isolated from blood, lymph
   nodes, and lymphoid associated structures of the pig small intestine of
   conventional pigs from day 1 to 47 of age and inbred miniature pigs
   between 12 and 82 days. The effect of weaning, and age before and after
   weaning, were also evaluated. Weaning had a significant effect on the
   number of CD4(+): CD8(+), double positive CD4(+)/CD8(+), CD21(+), delta
   gamma TCR+, SWC3(+) and SLA-DQ(+) cells. Aging of the pig before and
   after weaning resulted in significant changes in lymphocytes isolated
   from mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal sites. These results constitute an
   important baseline for studying mucosal immune response of neonatal pigs
   and identifying factors that influence the ability of the neonate to
   respond to the stresses and antigenic exposure associated with weaning.

Abstract = {{Cormorant impact upon natural fish populations has long been debated but
   little studied because of the requirements of sound data that are often
   hard to fill. In this study I have monitored fish community
   composition/abundance before and after a cormorant colony was
   established in a high productive lake, Ymsen, of south-central Sweden.
   Data on fish abundance before cormorant establishment enabled me to
   control for changes in fish densities prior to cormorant colonisation.
   To control for possible changes in fish populations caused by factors
   other than cormorant predation (i.e. large-scale regional changes due to
   climate) data were compared with a control lake, Garnsviken, with no
   cormorants. Since Lake Ymsen also harbour an important commercial
   fishery, cormorant impact upon fishery yields was evaluated. The most
   important fish species in the diet of the cormorants were ruffe (75\% by
   number), roach (11\%) and perch (10\%). Except for perch, commercially
   important fish made up a very small fraction of the cormorant diet. Eel,
   the most important fish for the fishery, was absent in the cormorant
   diet, pikeperch constituted 0.2\% and pike 1.5\%. Estimated fish outtake
   by the cormorants was 12.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to 8.6 kg ha(-1)
   yr(-1) for the fishery. Despite considerable fish withdrawal by the
   cormorants, fish populations did not seem to change in numbers or
   biomass.
   The present study indicates that cormorant impact upon fish populations
   in Lake Ymsen was small and probably in no case has led to declines of
   neither commercial nor of non-commercial fish species. Still, the number
   of breeding cormorants in Lake Ymsen, in relation to foraging area, is
   among the highest known for Swedish lakes.}},

Abstract = {{1. There is ongoing controversy about whether biased sex ratios in
   diploid insect populations are real or an artefact caused by different
   behaviours and/ or different catchability of the sexes. This was tested
   by monitoring two field and three semi-natural populations of the
   damselfly Lestes sponsa.
   2. Capture-mark-recapture data showed that population size estimates
   were about twice as large for males as for females at both field sites.
   Independent estimates of the sex ratios based on total numbers of males
   and females captured supported the male bias.
   3. Males had higher recapture probabilities than females due to longer
   times between successive visits in females. Because the same pattern was
   found in the semi-natural populations, the longer intervals in females
   are no artefact due to their lower detectability.
   4. Theoretical models show that the strong temporary emigration of
   females tends, if anything, to overestimate female population sizes and
   that the heterogeneity of recapture probabilities observed in males
   tends to underestimate male population sizes. Hence, behavioural
   differences between the sexes do not cause an artificially male-biased
   sex ratio.
   5. Spatial data show that operational sex ratios are male biased at the
   pond but become female biased in the plots further away from the
   shoreline; however because of the decrease in densities away from the
   shoreline, this does not result in a global even sex ratio.
   6. Spatial data, temporary emigration patterns, and independent
   estimates suggest strongly that the male-biased sex ratios in mature
   damselfly populations are real.}},

Abstract = {{1. Several hypotheses to account for biased sex ratios in mature insect
   populations were tested by monitoring two field populations of the
   damselfly Lestes sponsa and by pet-forming experiments in field cages.
   The population sex ratios are heavily male biased in this species.
   2. The observed sex ratio at emergence:was even and both sexes emerged
   synchronously. Females had longer maturation times but these were
   insufficient to explain the observed sex ratio shift.
   3. Mass increases during maturation were consistently larger in females.
   In agreement with this, immature females made more flights per unit of
   time, which should make the more vulnerable to predation, however
   maturation probabilities were lower in females only in one field cage
   experiment. This inconsistency may be due to long bad weather
   conditions. Interestingly, predators reduced mass increase and this
   reduction was larger in females than in males.
   4. Calculations:based on the sex specific maturation times show that
   only slightly lower daily survival probabilities during maturation in
   females are enough to generate the observed sex ratio shift.
   5. Mature survival was higher in males than in females in one field
   population but not in another, indicating that this cannot be a general
   mechanism causing the sex ratio. A higher maturation probability in
   males is therefore the most plausible mechanism causing the sex ratio
   shift in damselfly populations.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing fragmentation of natural areas and a dramatic reduction
   of forest cover in several parts of the world, quantifying the impact of
   such changes on species richness and community dynamics has been a
   subject of much concern. Here, we tested whether in more fragmented
   landscapes there was a lower number of area-sensitive species and higher
   local extinction and turnover rates, which could explain higher temporal
   variability in species richness. To investigate such potential landscape
   effects at a regional scale, we merged two independent, large-scale
   monitoring efforts: the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and
   the Land Use and Land Cover Classification data from the U.S. Geological
   Survey.
   We used methods that accounted for heterogeneity in the probability of
   detecting species to estimate species richness and temporal changes in
   the bird communities for BBS routes in three mid-Atlantic U.S. states.
   Forest breeding bird species were grouped prior to the analyses into
   area-sensitive and non-area-sensitive species according to previous
   studies. We tested predictions relating measures of forest structure at
   one point in time (1974) to species richness at that time and to
   parameters of forest bird community change over the following
   22-yr-period (1975-1996). We used the mean size of forest patches to
   characterize landscape structure, as high correlations among landscape
   Variables did not allow us to disentangle the relative roles of habitat
   fragmentation per se and habitat loss.
   As predicted, together with lower species richness for area-sensitive
   species on routes surrounded by landscapes with lower mean forest-patch
   size, we found higher mean year-to-year rates of local extinction.
   Moreover, the mean year-to-year rates of local turnover (proportion of
   locally new species) for area-sensitive species were also higher in
   landscapes with lower mean forest-patch size. These associations were
   not observed for the non-area-sensitive species group.
   These results suggest that landscape structure may influence forest bird
   communities at regional scales through its effects on the total number
   of species but also on the temporal rates of change in community
   composition. Evidence for higher rates of local extinction and turnover
   in more fragmented landscapes suggests that bird communities function as
   metapopulations at a regional scale, and points out the importance of
   colonizations and recolonizations from surrounding landscapes to local
   community dynamics. Further, our results illustrate that the methods
   used to estimate the community parameters can be a powerful statistical
   tool in addressing questions relative to the dynamics of communities.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, the
   only two vascular plant species native to Antarctica, are increasing. We
   performed a seed bank assay to determine the persistence of seeds from
   intact vegetation/soil cores collected near Palmer Station on the west
   coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Vegetation/soil cores were cold
   stratified at 3 degreesC for >4 years. Subsequent seed bank densities,
   estimated from seedlings germinated, averaged 847 and 5645 seedlings
   m(-2) for C. quitensis and D. antarctica. respectively. We also
   conducted germination trials on C. quitensis seeds collected at our
   field site and stored for either 120 days or >4 years at 3 degreesC.
   Germination rates ranged from 6\% after 120 days of cold storage to 38\%
   after >4 years of cold storage. These findings show that previous
   estimates of seed bank densities and germination rates in these species.
   based on short-term laboratory stratification experiments. may
   underestimate there found in the field. Stratospheric ozone depletion
   has lead to increases in ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-320 nm)
   along the Antarctic Peninsula during the austral spring. In a separate
   experiment we manipulated levels of biologically effective UV-B
   (UV-B-BE), over current-year C. quitensis seedlings near Palmer Station
   on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula by placing frames over them
   that either held filters that absorbed most UV-B-BE ('reduced UV-B-BE').
   transmitted most UV-B-BE ('near-ambient UV-B-BE') or had no filters
   ('ambient UV-B-BE). We monitored seedling survivorship over the course
   of the growing season (January-March) and growth acid pigment
   concentrations at the end of the season. There were no UV-B,, treatment
   effects on seedling survivorship oc er the course of the season and
   overwinter survivorship averaged 12\%. However, seedlings growing under
   near-ambient and ambient UV-B-BE had 25 and 48\% smaller total leaf
   areas, 7 and 16\% fewer leaves and 65 and 82\% fewer branches,
   respectively, than those growing under reduced UV-B-BE. In addition,
   concentrations of methanol-soluble UV-B-absorbing compounds were 26\%
   higher and concentrations of chlorophyll b were 26\% lower in leaves of
   seedlings growing under ambient UV-B-BE compared with those under
   reduced UV-B-BE. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mealybug Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green) has extended its range
   throughout the Caribbean region since it was first detected in Grenada
   in 1991, and has recently been detected in Southern California, Mexico,
   and Central America. Laboratory and field experiments using virgin
   females were conducted on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, to determine
   if females attract males with pheromones. Virgin females isolated in
   gelatin capsules attracted on average one male to each capsule over a
   period of 18 h in the laboratory compared with gelatin capsules without
   females. Adhesive traps baited with virgin females and placed on
   hibiscus, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L.,in the field, captured more males at
   all three study localities on St. Croix than did unbaited traps. Virgin
   females attracted more males than controls at 0-10 m from infested
   hibiscus, but were capable of attracting males at 50 m distance from an
   infestation. The attractiveness of virgin females to flying males
   strongly suggests the involvement of a female-produced sex pheromone.
   Isolation and synthesis of such a sea pheromone would provide a valuable
   tool for population monitoring and control of this invasive pest.}},

Abstract = {{Because riparian forest strips are perceived to buffer aquatic
   ecosystems from logging-related disturbance, they are usually not
   harvested. However, their value as refuges for terrestrial wildlife is
   unknown. We conducted two live-trapping experiments in the riparian zone
   adjacent to rivers in a boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forest in
   Quebec. In the first experiment, we compared late summer use, during 4
   separate years, of different width riparian strips (20, 40, 60 m, and
   control {[}>300 m wide]), and different stand thinning intensities (20 m
   intact and 20 m thinned of; of all trees) on resident small mammals. We
   found no differences in the densities of the most common species,
   Clethrionomys gapperi and Peromyscus maniculatus, among strip types or
   among years (P>0.05). We also tested for edge effects in large strips
   (60 m and controls). In controls, C. gapperi was less abundant in the
   first 20 m adjacent to the river (P=0.004) while P. maniculatus was more
   abundant (P=0.02) in that area. Neither species, however, showed an edge
   effect in the 60 m-strips (P>0.10). In the second experiment, we
   monitored small mammals over eight consecutive weeks in a 160 mx170 m
   quadrat enclosing a 20 m-thinned forest strip and st clear-cut to
   investigate some aspects of the role of riparian strips at the landscape
   scale. During that time, Microtus pennsylvanicus, which was nearly
   absent from our study area in the previous years, invaded the clear-cuts
   and apparently confined C. gapperi and P. maniculatus to forest remnants
   such as 20 m-wide strips. A conclusion that emerges from this study and
   related studies on birds is that some species prefer larger strips or
   non-riparian habitats whereas others prefer narrow strips along riparian
   habitats. We recommend that managers ban the all-encompassing norms and
   manage for heterogeneity at different scales. Because our study was
   conducted at the stand scale and because it is not accompanied with an
   evaluation of the socio-economic aspects of riparian management, we
   cannot determine the proper mixture of strips in the landscape. However,
   our results could help managers to enhance the key-role of riparian
   ecosystems in maintaining regional biodiversity and contribute to the
   maintenance of local biodiversity by creating refuges for terrestrial
   wildlife. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The colonization dynamics of the black truffle in an artificial field
   were assessed through analyses of microsatellite and RAPD markers. The
   truffle field was composed of three tree species and mycelial inoculum
   of three different origins, and was monitored for the first three years
   of truffle production. We found very low levels of genetic diversity.
   Isolation by distance was detected only at the between-tree level. This
   could be interpreted as local colonization around each tree facilitated
   by the presence of the tree root system. At the larger spatial scale of
   the European range, the absence of isolation by distance corroborates
   the hypothesis of an impact of glaciation on genetic variation, followed
   by rapid postglaciation demographic expansion. In addition, genetic
   variation of harvested truffles was explained by neither inoculation
   origin, nor tree species. Our study questions the real impact of manmade
   inoculation of tree root systems with fungal mycelia.}},

   in conjunction with geographic information systems interpretations.
   Stakeholder values were used to develop assessment endpoints, and
   regional stressors and habitats were identified. The risk hypotheses
   expressed in the conceptual model were that agriculture and land
   clearing for rural residential are producing multiple stressors that
   have potential for contamination of local waterbodies, eutrophication,
   changes in hydrology, reduction in the habitat of native flora and
   fauna, reductions in populations of beneficial insects in agricultural
   production systems, increased weed competition in pastures, and loss of
   aesthetic value in residential areas. In the risk analysis the catchment
   was divided into risk regions based on topography and land use.
   Stressors were ranked on likelihood of occurrence, while habitats were
   ranked on percentage land area. Risk characterization showed risks to
   the maintenance of productive primary industries were highest across all
   risk regions, followed by maintenance of a good residential environment
   and maintenance of fish populations. Sensitivity analysis was conducted
   to show the variability in risk outcomes stemming from uncertainty about
   stressors and habitats. Outcomes from this assessment provide a basis
   for planning regional environmental monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Artisanal fisheries for mud crabs are an important source of income in
   coastal communities of the Mekong Delta. However, populations are
   subject to pressure from increasing fishing effort to provide seed crabs
   for pond culture, as well as diminishing mangrove habitats. In the
   present study, Scylla paramamosain was found to be the dominant mud crab
   species within an estuarine mangal system, representing over 96.8\% of
   mud crab fishery landings between February 1998 and March 1999. S.
   olivacea was also present in relatively low abundance (3.2\% of
   landings). Analysis of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data collected
   throughout 1997 and 1998, for an intertidal hand-fishery, shows that mud
   crabs were present in a fairly narrow range of mean abundance throughout
   the year, despite protracted periods of freshwater conditions during the
   rainy season. Recruitment of juvenile S. paramamosain (3-4 cm carapace
   width) was continuous through 1998, with a significant peak at the
   beginning of the dry season. No juvenile S. olivacea (< 5 cm carapace
   width) were found during the study. The mangal appears to provide a
   nursery habitat for S. paramamosain, with predominantly juveniles and
   sub-adults present, while a higher proportion of adults were recorded in
   the sub-tidal component of the population. Mature females were present
   throughout the year, with a peak in September-October 1997. The CPUE
   analysis provides a baseline of seasonal variation in crab abundance
   that can be used to monitor the effectiveness of resource management and
   potential impacts of future changes in habitat.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term plankton monitoring programme resulted in a tell-year record
   (1988-1997) Tor bloom timing and magnitude at four sites in the Quoddy
   Region. Two sites are located in areas removed from salmonid aquaculture
   operations, whereas two sites were located close to an aquaculture site.
   However, at one of these. cages were removed in 1994. Thalassiosira
   nordenskioeldii was detected each spring during the months of April
   through June. Highest concentrations were observed during 1991 or 1992.
   with cell concentrations at ail four stations two to three times greater
   than during most other years. This diatom was more variable in its
   relative contribution to the phytoplankton community at the
   non-aquaculture locations and rarely exceeded 60\% at any of the
   stations. Trend analysis of relative abundance data revealed significant
   positive trends only for the two aquaculture sites (Spearman/Lettenmaier
   test. slopes 1.40\% and slope 0.79\% yr(-1)). Concurrently, the
   aquaculture site located in a sheltered bay also showed a significant
   negative trend in salinity. The analysis suggests that T.
   nordenskioeldii has increased its contribution to the phytoplankton
   community at the sites located near aquaculture activity, one of which
   also became less saline. These changes may be related to aquaculture
   activities, although the causative factor(s) is yet unidentified. The
   trends suggest that this diatom is sensitive to changes in the local
   environment. (C) 2001 International Council for the Exploration of the

Abstract = {{I report data collected on red-failed guenon (Cercopithecus ascanius
   schmidti) fruit processing behaviors between June 1993 and April 1994.
   Red-tailed guenons consumed the fruit of Strychnos mitis in 542 of 2,930
   fruit-eating events (FEEs). The monkeys spat out cleaned seeds of
   Strychnos mitis in a majority of these records (477/542; 88\%); seeds
   were occasionally swallowed whole, bur only when pulp was unripe
   (69/542; 12\%). In 83\% of the FEEs on Strychnos, the red-tailed guenons
   spat out seeds within 10 m of the removal sire; they typically stayed in
   the same tree while processing fruit, and in 56\% of the FEEs, they
   moved <1 m before spitting seeds. I monitored spat seeds to evaluate the
   impact of monkey fruit processing on seed fate. Results indicate that
   83\% of seeds spat out by the red-tailed guenons germinated, while only
   12\% of unprocessed seeds survived to germination (p < 0.01). Of the
   processed seeds that germinated, 60\% survived to germination and
   seedling establishment, while only 5\% of unprocessed seeds survived to
   seedling establishment (p < 0.01). Unprocessed seeds were also more
   likely to be attacked by seed predators (p < 0.01) and fungus (p <
   0.01). Although there is generally high mortality in seeds/seedlings,
   mature trees of Strychnos mitis are found in groves of adults, under
   which dense populations of seedlings and saplings can occur. These data
   suggest that Strychnos mitis does not conform to expectations of the
   Janzen-Connell model of seed escape from parent trees. Instead, I
   suggest that by removing pulp, a process that results in a reduction of
   fungal pathogen attack, red-tailed guenons positively effect the seen
   pulp-cleaning ant species it is a hitherto undescribed effect of
   primates on their fruit resources.}},

Abstract = {{The lower developmental threshold and the developmental rate of eggs and
   5 larval instars of citrus cutworm Egira curialis (Grote) were
   calculated using five temperature regimes: 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20
   degrees, 25 degrees and 30 degreesC. At 10 degreesC, eggs did not hatch
   after 20 days and neonate larvae introduced to this temperature
   experienced high mortality and were unable to attain the fifth larval
   instar 76 days after eclosion. The developmental rate of citrus cutworm
   from oviposition until initiation of pupation was linearly correlated
   with temperature over the range of 15 degrees to 25 degreesC and larval
   survivorship was greater than 80\% for the duration of the experiment.
   The rate of development of citrus cutworm larvae exposed to the 30
   degreesC treatment was similar to those exposed to 25 degreesC; however,
   larval survivorship at 30 degreesC was significantly reduced. The linear
   regression equation for the period of oviposition through 50\% second
   instar larvae gave a theoretical lower developmental threshold for
   citrus cutworm of 7.6 degreesC. Based on this value, E. curialis
   requires approximately 258 (C) degree-days (DD) to advance from
   oviposition to 50\% second-instar larvae in the laboratory. A dosage of
   100 micrograms synthetic pheromone/lure was found to effectively monitor
   weekly flights of male citrus cutworm. Field studies indicate that first
   capture of mixed populations of first and second instar larvae begins
   approximately 203 DD (C) after a biofix of the second consecutive week
   of moth capture using a 7.6 degreesC lower developmental threshold.
   Third instar larvae began appearing an average of 315 DD (C) after the
   biofix. Using degree-days to predict first appearance of larvae and
   first appearance of 3(rd) instar larvae should improve efficacy of
   selective pesticides because the younger larval instars will be detected
   and treated.}},

Abstract = {{1. Blowfly infestation of sun-drying fish is a major economic problem in
   many developing countries of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. To consider
   the ecology of infestation, adult and larval blowfly populations were
   monitored between 27 October 1997 and 27 April 1999 at a fish landing
   and drying site, approximately 5 km north of Calicut, in Kerala state on
   the coast of south-west India.
   2. During the 548-day sampling period, a total of 96 953 adult Diptera
   was collected from 16 sticky targets, placed inside and outside eight
   fish-storage sheds. Of these, 91 912 (95\%) were Chrysomya megacephala,
   3719 (4\%) were other Calliphoridae and 1322 (1\%) were other species,
   largely Sarcophagidae.
   3. The population of C. megacephala showed pronounced seasonal
   fluctuations in response to climate, particularly relative humidity.
   Significantly shorter-frequency fluctuations within fish-processing
   sheds were also evident, the periodicity of which corresponded
   approximately to C. megacephala generation cycles. Spatial variation in
   C. megacephala abundance was evident within the site, higher populations
   occurring closest to the beach and numbers declining with distance
   inland.
   4. The pattern of drying fish infestation by C. megacephala broadly
   followed changes in the density of adult flies and the seasonal change
   in weather, with peaks during the monsoon and troughs in the dry hot
   periods. High relative humidity played a significant but secondary role
   in increasing infestation.
   5. Quantification of the relationship between larval infestation and
   percentage fish loss suggests that, given the infestation levels
   observed, between 10\% and 60\% post-harvest wet weight losses would be
   expected in the monsoon period, depending on the species of fish landed.
   6. The study emphasizes the importance of developing a clear
   understanding of the basic ecology and spatial and temporal dynamics of
   an insect pest, prior to the design or implementation of any pest
   management programme.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge for agriculture is management of insect resistance to
   toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produced by transgenic crops.
   Here we describe how a large-scale program is being developed in Arizona
   for management of resistance to Bt cotton in the pink bollworm,
   Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), and
   other insect pests of cotton. Financial support from growers makes this
   program possible. Collaboration between the Arizona Cotton Research and
   Protection Council, the University of Arizona, and government agencies
   has led to development of resistance management guidelines, a remedial
   action plan, and tools for monitoring compliance with the proposed
   guidelines. Direct participation in development of resistance management
   policies is a strong incentive for growers to invest in resistance
   management research. However, more research, regularly updated
   regulations, and increased collaboration between stakeholders are
   urgently needed to maintain efficacy of Bt toxins in transgenic crops.}},

Abstract = {{The green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Say), the southern green stink
   bug, Nezara viridula (L.), and the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus
   (Say), were predominant phytophagous Pentatomidae detected during
   1995-1997 in cotton in South Carolina. These species occurred in similar
   numbers in conventional and transgenic cotton ` NuCOTN33B `, containing
   the gene for expression of CryIA(c) delta -endotoxin of Bacillus
   thuringiensis Berliner variety kurstaki. Adult stink bugs moved into
   cotton from wild and cultivated alternate hosts during July, and
   reproducing populations usually were detected in cotton from late July
   into September. Applications of either methyl parathion (0.56 kg
   {[}AI]/ha) directed for stink bugs or lambda -cyhalothrin (0.037 kg
   {[}AI]/ha) or cyfluthrin (0.056 kg {[}AI] /ha) for control of cotton
   bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), provided effective control of
   pentatomids in NuCOTN33B or conventional ` DP5415 ` and increased yields
   compared with untreated plots. Fiber quality did not differ among
   treated or untreated plots of NuCOTN33B. The ground-cloth technique was
   used to estimate populations of stink bugs, and data indicated that
   treatment at one bug per 2 m of row adequately protected cotton from
   yield loss due to stink bug damage. Observations on boil damage
   indicated that treatment might be necessary if >20-25\% reveal internal
   symptoms of feeding injury during mid- to late season. More detailed
   damage thresholds should be developed to complement an approach based on
   population monitoring. This study validated current recommendations for
   management of pentatomids in cotton, demonstrated the necessity of
   threshold use for stink bugs in transgenic cultivars expressing
   endotoxin from B. thuringiensis, and provided insight into further
   development of management options for pentatomids in the crop.}},

Abstract = {{Trapping results indicate that pepper maggot, Zonosemata electa (Say),
   flies occupy tree canopies adjacent to fields when not on host plants.
   Several in- and near-field trap positions were used to find a reliable
   monitoring system for adult pepper maggots. Traps baited with liquid
   ammonium hydroxide (Stills-style trap), hung in the canopy of trees on
   the edges of pepper fields. caught significantly more Z. electa flies
   than when positioned lower along the treeline or in the field. In a
   second experiment, significantly more pepper maggot flies were captured
   in sugar maples compared with choke cherry trees, which indicates a pest
   preference for certain nonhost habitats. The lowest trap height tested
   (2.1 m) failed to capture Z. electa flies in either tree species when
   the pest population level was low. These studies demonstrated that
   pepper maggot flies can be reliably, detected with Stills-style traps
   positioned at approximate to6.4 m height within the canopy of sugar
   maple trees adjacent to pepper fields. Fruit oviposition scars also are
   useful site-specific indicators of pepper maggot presence/absence and
   may aid in determining if insecticide applications are necessary and in
   timing sprays.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of the aphid pathogen, Pandora neoaphidis (Remaudiere \&

   (Sulzer) complex (green peach aphid, M. persicae, and the tobacco aphid,
   M. nicotianae Blackman) on fall-planted cabbage, spinach-mustard, and
   turnip from 1993 to 1996. Each fall, the pathogen occurred at moderate
   levels in M. persicae complex on all three hosts, Average level of
   mycoses on the three host plants ranged from 10.0 to 14.3\% in 1993,
   from 5.9 to 10.1\% in 1994. and from 7.9 to 17.4\% in 1995. Each year,
   the highest incidence of the pathogen in aphids on turnip and
   spinach-mustard was 20 to 25\%. while the incidence on cabbage was 12 to
   19\%, In 1995 and over the 3 yrs combined, the levels of mycoses were
   significantly higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) in aphids on turnip
   and spinach-mustard than on cabbage. Trends were similar in 1993 and
   1994, but differences were not significant. Very low numbers of healthy
   aphids (<2 per 5 plants in 1994 to 5 aphids per 5 plants in late April
   1996) and those infected with or killed by P. neoaphidis occurred on
   turnip, cabbage, and spinach-mustard from Jan to May. The M. persicae
   complex was significantly more abundant on cabbage than it was on
   spinach-mustard or turnip. The pathogen overwinters at very low levels
   in cadavers of M. persicae complex on Brassica.}},

Abstract = {{In 1998 and 1999, field studies were conducted near Rosemount, MN to
   assess the potential impact of transgenic sweet corn, transformed to
   express the Cry1Ab toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner var
   kurstaki(i.e., Bt corn), on several beneficial insects, including
   predatory coccinellids, chrysopids and anthocorids. Beneficial insects
   in both St and in non-Bt sweet corn were also monitored in field cages
   in 1999. Plants were visually sampled for beneficial insects by
   arbitrarily selecting 3 consecutive plants from each plot or 6
   plants/cage. Rank transformed data were analyzed using the
   Kruskal-Wallis test. which indicated no significant within-year
   differences in the overall density of beneficial insect populations
   between Bt and non-Bt sweet corn. Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) was the
   dominant predator species detected in 1998 and 1999. A significant trend
   (P < 0.05) was found for C. maculata larvae in open plots, with non-Bt
   treatments having higher C. maculata levels than Bt. Also, C. maculata
   larval and adult densities, for caged plots, showed a significant trend
   for higher counts in the in non-Bt corn. No additional differences in
   species diversity of beneficial insects were detected using Hills N1.
   Neither Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Menville, Adalia bipunctata (L.),
   nor Coccinella septempunctata L. were observed during 1999. Although our
   test detected significant trends for higher densities of C. maculata in
   non-Bt corn, the results also suggest that longer-term in-field studies
   with higher sample sizes are needed to further characterize what may be
   relatively subtle population effects in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Population density, biomass, seasonal growth and gonad index of the
   heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum were monitored in muddy sediments of
   the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, from July 1998 to July 2000. Rates of
   sediment ingestion by the urchin were also measured. juveniles settled
   in winter and their growth in the first year was rapid. Individual
   somatic mass in terms of ash-free dry weight (AFDW) increased from about
   0.1 to 40 mg while the test length increased from about 2 to 20 mm. At
   the end of the second and third year dearly December), somatic mass
   averaged 90 and 120 mg AFDW (test length=30 and 33 mm), respectively.
   The gonads of both year-classes matured during this period and spawning
   followed within two months. Individual E. cordatum (test length=29-34
   mm) ingested sediments at rates of 14-43 mg wet weight per hour.
   Population density (28 m(-2)) and AFDW biomass (2.8 g m(-2)) of E.
   cordatum test length greater than or equal to 15 mm) were high at the
   start of monitoring (July 1998), remained relatively constant through
   the next spring and rapidly decreased to < 2 m(-2) and < 0.2 g AFDW
   m(-2), respectively, by December 1999. When abundant, E. cordatum
   comprised about 60\% of the macrobenthic biomass in the study area and
   its annual production in AFDW reached about 1.5 g m(-2) y(-1) suggesting
   substantial contributions of the urchin in material cycling through the
   sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Survival estimates are important for understanding and managing wildlife
   populations. I used radiotelemetry to estimate survival and
   cause-specific mortality of a non-harvested fox squirrel (Sciurus niger)
   population in southwestern Georgia, United States. Adult fox squirrels
   (n = 101) were monitored continuously from March 1998 to December 1999.
   I determined the cause of death to be predation in 7 cases, disease in 5
   cases, and unknown in 12 cases. Sex and season-specific mortalities were
   independent of the cause of mortality; therefore, I omitted cause of
   mortality from subsequent analyses. I did not detect differences in
   seasonal survival between males and Females (P = 0.27) or among seasons
   (P = 0.52). When sexes were pooled, seasonal survival (+/- SE) ranged
   from 0.86 +/- 0.07 to 0.92 +/- 0.02. Annual survival of males (0.73 +/-
   0.07) and females (0.66 +/- 0.07) was similar (P = 0.60). When sexes
   were pooled, annual survival was 0.69 =/- 0.07. High fox squirrel
   survivorship, relative to gray squirrels (S. carolinensis), challenges
   the paradigm that similar strategies should be used to manage harvest of
   fox squirrels and gray squirrels.}},

Abstract = {{The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), a
   nonmigratory, cooperatively breeding species limited to the older-growth
   pine forests of the southeastern United States, requires living pine
   trees for cavity excavation. Since the 1950s, alteration and destruction
   of critical woodpecker habitat have caused a decline in red-cockaded
   woodpecker populations. The red-cockaded woodpecker now exists mostly in
   small, scattered populations whose respective members have little
   opportunity to interbreed. In general, as populations become smaller and
   more isolated, the frequency of inbreeding increases and genetic
   diversity and population viability may decrease. The introduction of
   unrelated individuals into disjunct red-cockaded woodpecker populations
   may reduce inbreeding, maintain genetic variability, and reduce local
   extinction. We developed a technique for selecting red-cockaded
   woodpecker nestlings and transferring them into the nests of unrelated
   conspecifics. For each translocation, we paired nests ht age and
   exchanged 1 nestling From each, so that 2 introductions were made with
   reciprocal translocation event. Nest visitation by the parents and
   fledging success of nestlings were monitored. Fostered nestlings were
   accepted by their new parents, and the rate of successful fledging hy
   fostered nestlings was not different from that of nonfostered control
   nestlings. We concluded that reciprocal intraspecific Fostering of
   similarly aged nestlings can be used safely and effectively to
   translocate red-cockaded woodpeckers and may have advantages over the
   translocation of adults and juveniles under certain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian cottonwood (Populus angustifolia) forests provide avian
   habitats that are of high conservation value throughout western North
   America. We compared avian nest success, brood parasitism, species
   richness, and species abundance among 24 cottonwood forest patches
   representing a range of sizes and shapes. We randomly selected patches
   in 3 ranges of size, small (0.1-0.6 ha). medium (1.2-2.5 ha), and large
   (4.0-6.2 ha); and 2 ranges of shape, compact (1.00-1.83) and edgy
   (1.87-3.30). We measured patch shape using the Patton Diversity Index.
   We monitored 313 nets of 20 species over 2 years. Only American robin (
   Turdus migratorius) nests exhibited a negative relationship between
   distance from edge and probability of daily nest survival. We found no
   relationship between the probability of nest parasitism and patch size,
   patch shape, or nest distance from edge. Point counts revealed that both
   richness and abundance of forest-interior bird species increased with
   patch sire. Forest-interior species abundance also increased with
   decreasing Patton Diversity index. Our results suggest that patch
   edginess has a negative effect on the abundance of forest-interior
   birds. Although our results do not show that patch edginess has a
   negative effect on nest success, the emphasize the importance of species
   autecology in relation to the effects of edge on avian nesting success.}},

Abstract = {{Because the brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) has virtually extirpated
   the avifauna on Guam and is a threat to other Pacific islands. the
   development of alternative and efficient control methods is required.
   Therefore, we performed a large-scale field experiment to determine
   whether the acetaminophen baits we developed could be used to reduce
   population levels of brown treesnakes on Guam. Toxic baits were made by
   inserting 80 mg of acetaminophen into dead neonatal mice, and these
   mouse bails were used to treat plots. Reference plots were baited with
   unadulterated baits. We used mark-recapture methods to estimate snake
   abundance on plots before treatment, monitored bait-take rates on
   treated plots for 30 days, and used mark-recapture to estimate snake
   populations post-treatment. Bait-take rates were reduced on treated
   plots by 83\% relative to reference plots after 14 days, when they
   reached an asymptote. Using a robust design model in program MARK,
   snakes on reference plots had higher apparent survival rates ((x) over
   bar = 0.3505) than those on treated plots ((x) over bar = 0.0072) for
   the duration of the study, but estimates were influenced by snake
   movement between plots. When we accounted for movement using a
   multistrata model. survival on treated plots was estimated as zero. High
   mobility of brown treesnakes presents difficulty for complete removal of
   snakes from large areas, but we conclude that acetaminophen baits may
   provide an effective and selective management tool for quickly and
   efficiently reducing populations of brown treesnakes on Guam.}},

Abstract = {{Resightings of recognizable individual Florida manatees, Trichechus
   manatus latirostris, in Sarasota Bay provided information on life
   history and reproductive parameters. These parameters have been
   documented at winter aggregation sites, but few data existed for
   Florida's west coast at non-winter sites. Life history data are needed
   to estimate annual reproduction and survival rates and construct
   population models for manatees along west central Florida. Observations
   of 113 recognizable manatees of known sex sighted between 1993 and 1997
   indicated a 1:1 sex ratio. Fifty-three females produced at least 55
   calves during five years of observation. Two large, presumably sexually
   mature females were never observed with calves in over five years of
   monitoring. Not surprisingly, several reproductive parameters matched
   those measured in previous studies at winter sites with a mean of 1.8
   seasons of calf dependence, 2.2 seasons between births, and age of
   sexual maturity at 3-4 yr. Birth rates, fecundity, and proportions of
   females with calves varied only slightly among investigations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a standardized metric for quantifying the rate
   change in community structure of complex mixed microbial cultures such
   as those maintained in biological wastewater treatment systems.
   Quantifying the stability of microbial community structures is a first
   step toward more aggressive monitoring and control of biological systems
   for greater reliability in contaminant removal. Statistical analysis of
   compositions that uniquely specify the balance of populations of species
   in a mixed culture sample can be used to specify a biosolids community
   state as a unique position in an orthogonal coordinate system. Changes
   in biosolids state are observable as a trajectory within this coordinate
   space, and the rate of passage along this trajectory relates to the
   population dynamics. The geometric interpretation and the statistical
   analysis methods necessary for the proposed calculation methodology are
   introduced by way of simulated case studies with a simple model system.
   With the example of this model system, concepts of changing microbial
   community shape and size are contrasted. The rate change in community
   structure is defined geometrically in terms of a rate change in relative
   proportions of the characteristic community shape at constant biomass. A
   change in biomass is defined as the rate change in the quantity of
   biosolids at constant shape. The method robustness with respect to
   random measurement error was also demonstrated using the model system.
   The potential applications of the approach are presented with
   experimental data of microbial fatty acid compositions extracted from
   samples during the operation of bench-scale bioreactors degrading
   contaminants found in pulp mill wastewater. Scaling the level of
   population dynamics with a metric that is independent of chemotypic
   content presents a standard for direct comparisons of community
   responses between distinct cultures and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Persistence of recombinant and wild-type nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV)
   was compared in field and laboratory microcosm experiments. Horizontal
   and vertical distribution of the viruses also was monitored in the field
   agricultural soil. Mixed populations of the bollworm, Helicoverpa zea,
   and tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens, in cotton were sprayed five
   times during a growing season with wild-type H. tea NPV (HzSNPV.WT) or
   with a genetically modified H, tea NPV expressing an insect-specific
   neurotoxin (HzSNPV.LqhIT2). HzNPV.WT accumulated 2.3 times as many
   occlusion bodies (OB) as HzSNPV.LqhIT2 in soil by the end of the growing
   season in October 1997. Both NPVs were detected at all soil depths down
   to 26-35 cm. Both NPVs were randomly distributed among 0-2 cm soil
   samples throughout the plots according to analysis with Taylor's power
   law. By 4 August 1998, soil concentration of HzSNPV.WT was only 11-13
   OB/g at depths from 0 to 14 cm, and the wild-type virus was not detected
   below 14 cm. HzSNPV.LqhIT2 was detected only in trace amounts at 0-2 cm
   at this time. Neither NPV was detected in bioassays of cotton leaves nor
   in insects sampled from the plots in 1998. Viral persistence also was
   monitored in laboratory soil microcosms. Three viruses-wild-type
   Autographa californica NPV (AcNPV.WT), A. californica NPV expressing a
   scorpion toxin (AcNPV.AaIT), and A. californica NPV expressing juvenile
   hormone esterase (AcNPV.JHE-S201G)-were introduced into soil microcosms
   by each of two methods, in water suspension or in host cadavers, for a
   total of six treatments plus controls. After 17 months, the number of
   viable OB remaining did not differ among the treatments. The results
   indicate that the only differences in soil populations of wild-type
   versus recombinant NPVs are due to the greater amounts of the wild-type
   viruses that accumulate, probably because they have a greater capacity
   to replicate in the host insect population.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus
   Zimmerman) reduces the height of plants and may cause reallocation of
   resources normally used for sexual reproduction. With time, the cover of
   herbaceous species may be altered as browsing creates a competitive
   disadvantage for preferred species. The development of equations that
   predict herbaceous cover based on plant height and/or flowering status
   allows managers to identify excessive browsing before lasting damage to
   plant populations occurs. We measured the heights of three herbaceous
   species-sweet cicely (Osmorhiza claytonii {[}Michx.] C.B. Clarke),
   jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum {[}L.] Schott), and white
   baneberry (Actaea pachypoda Ell.)-in Indiana state parks to determine if
   existing equations effectively predict deer browse damage based on the
   relationship between plant height and herbaceous cover. Flowering status
   was also recorded to test the relationship between sexual maturity and
   plant height. Based upon this data-intensive evaluation, regression
   models using plant height were effective in predicting percent cover of
   herbaceous species as an index of browse damage. While flowering status
   of jack-in-the-pulpit and white baneberry were strongly related to plant
   height (R-2 = 0.91 and R-2 = 0.91, respectively), sweet cicely flowering
   status showed no relationship to height (R-2 = 0.02). Examining the
   heights of these three species may provide an efficient and accurate
   method of evaluating the impacts of deer abundance on forest plant
   communities in the lower Midwest.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus
   Zimmerman) on reproductive activity of five understory plant taxa was
   examined using two deer exclosures in the Blue Ridge Mountains of
   Virginia, USA. Surveys were conducted within and outside of deer
   exclosures using 250-m(2) strip transects. Uvularia L. spp., Smilacina
   Desf. spp., Polygonatum Mill. spp., Orchis spectabilis L., and Arisaema
   triphyllum (L.) Schott were identified and counted, and noted for
   reproductive activity (presence of flowering and/or fruiting plants).
   Smilacina and Uvularia had more plants inside than outside of
   exclosures, whereas no significant differences in abundance were
   recorded for the other taxa. Reproductive activity of all taxa observed
   was greater inside than outside of exclosures. The survey method was
   field tested by determining the abundance and percent of plants
   reproductive at 11 sites along the Blue Ridge. Reproductive activity,
   for all taxa, was negatively correlated with deer abundance. This study
   demonstrates the potential for deer herbivory to affect herbaceous plant
   community composition and indicates that a measure of reproductive
   activity in common forest forbs would provide a rapid means to measure
   the severity of deer browsing on herbaceous species.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the practicality, economic, and sampling efficiency of
   potential monitoring programs is a first step in validation. Thus, we
   established a system of nest boxes in southeast Ohio to evaluate the
   feasibility of using a system of nest boxes to monitor changes in
   southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) populations. We recorded the
   time of box placement until first usage and types of use by flying
   squirrels as an indicator of presence as well as nest box occupancy
   trends on a month-to-month basis to assess usage patterns and
   productivity. Using monitoring results from 4 years, we evaluated
   alternative survey sampling techniques for occupancy and determined
   sample sizes necessary to estimate occupancy within specified relative
   bounds. We also studied the cost of establishing a nest box system and
   monitoring nest box use. At low nest box occupancy (9.4\%), sample size
   necessary to monitor trend would be extreme (431 boxes for 30\% relative
   bound), but sample size is not restrictive when occupancy rates exceed
   17\% (211 boxes to achieve 20\% relative bound). Monitoring combined
   spring and summer litter sizes in November or December as a measure of
   recruitment would require a smaller effort to achieve a tighter relative
   bound (10\%). Assumptions relating these demographic parameters to
   habitat change or disturbance still must be tested before the systematic
   placement of nest boxes can be considered the optimum approach to
   monitor southern flying squirrel response as measured by changes in
   population density or recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain gazelles were reintroduced to central Arabia during 1991-95.
   Hawtah reserve was searched for gazelles during the 1998-99 winter.
   Gazelles were seen in one wadi system and their signs were found in
   several others and on the plateau. sightings were used to calculate the
   minimum number of gazelles in the Matham wadi system, which previously
   held most of the population. During October-November 1998, the minimum
   number was 64 per cent less than 4 years earlier. Frequent observation
   of recent signs in areas where no gazelles were seen suggested that
   daytime sightings alone were no longer adequate for monitoring this
   population The decline in the number of gazelles seen, an increase in
   their flight distance and an apparent change in their activity patterns
   were consistent with the rangers' claim that poaching had commonly
   occurred. Poaching started after reserve management built, without
   adequate consultation, a new fence that was intended to bar local people
   from part of the reserve. Management lessons include the need for the
   following: continued monitoring of reintroduced populations after the
   initial postrelease phase; long-term dialogue with local people;
   effective law enforcement; and the management of aridland domestic
   livestock in ways that prevent inter specific competition for food
   causing the elimination of wild ungulates.}},

Abstract = {{Large populations of marine turtles breeding in the Cayman Islands were
   drastically reduced in the early 1800s. However, marine turtle nesting
   still occurs in the islands. The present-day status of this nesting
   population provides insight into the conservation of marine turtles, a
   long-lived species. In 1998 and 1999, the first systematic survey of
   marine turtle nesting in the Cayman Islands found 38 nests on 22 beaches
   scattered through the three islands. Three species were found: the green
   Chelonia mydas, hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata and loggerhead Caretta
   caretta turtles. Comparison with other rookeries suggests that the small
   number of sexually mature adults surviving Cayman's huge perturbations
   may be impeding population recovery. This shows the need to implement
   conservation measures prior to massive reductions in population size.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to study the ecological system of the Pardo River, at
   the source and lower-order passages, which are in the Botucatu area, Sao
   Paulo State, Brazil. This study was carried out to determine water
   quality with some chemical-physical indicators, coliforms, and chemical
   species of samples taken monthly, 1995/02-1996/01, from eight sampling
   stations sited along the Pardo River. The results in the river
   monitoring are discussed based on annual averages, analysis of variance,
   and compared to Tukey's Studentized Range-HSD, and principal component
   analysis (PCA) was applied to normalize data to assess association
   between variables. We can conclude that the variables used are very
   efficient for identifying and that the dry season shows the worst water
   quality. These were caused by organic matter, nutrients (originate) from
   anthropogenic sources (spatial sources) and mainly municipal wastewater,
   affecting the quality and hydrochemistry of the river water, which have
   been differentiated and assigned to polluting sources. Meanwhile, the
   degree of degradation of the Pardo River is low (sewage treatment
   carried out by the city of Pardinho is efficient), leaving the water of
   the river suitable for use by the population of Botucatu, after
   conventional treatment (Conama, Resolucao No. 20, CONAMA, Brazilia DF,
   09-23, 1986-the water of the Pardo river is classified as level 03). (C)

Abstract = {{Pollutants that are present in the aquatic environment and cause
   abnormal endocrine function in wildlife populations have been termed
   endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The impacts of these chemicals on
   the reproduction and development of vertebrates has been shown to be
   significant in both field studies and laboratory experiments. Over the
   past decade the number of investigations into the impacts of EDCs that
   affect reproductive and sexual characteristics (reproductive EDCs) has
   increased and evidence of their potency is evident in numerous wildlife
   species and through data from in vitro tests. However, little
   information is available on whether chemicals which act as EDCs in
   vertebrate species affect aquatic invertebrates. The case of imposer in
   archeogastropods following exposure to tributyltin (TBT) is a notable
   exception. Moreover, a number of studies have shown that development,
   fecundity and reproductive output of some aquatic invertebrates are
   affected significantly by exposure to pollutants. In order to determine
   whether external signs of exposure to vertebrate EDCs can be observed
   and monitored in invertebrate species, we exposed larvae of the barnacle
   Elminius modestus to environmentally realistic concentrations of the
   xeno-oestrogen, 4-n-nonylphenol (NP), and the natural oestrogen, 17 beta
   -oestradiol (E-2). Early life stages (nauplii and cyprids) were also
   exposed in the laboratory to determine whether there were effects on the
   timing of larval development and settlement. Ovary development and size
   of juveniles was measured following chronic exposure. Exposure to NP in
   the concentration range 0.01-10 mug l(-1) resulted in disruption of the
   timing of larval development. Similar results were obtained with E-2.
   Pulse exposures showed that the timing of exposure is critical and
   exposures for a period of 12 months caused long-term effects. A linear,
   concentration-dependent response was not evident. (C) 2001 Elsevier

   of summer and winter roosts, monitoring and bat-banding were implemented
   to find movements between the colonies. Data on roost utilisation by
   this species in south-eastern Slovakia, collected in a similar way, were
   included. far comparison. Twenty-two marked bats were recaptured. The
   studied bats created nursery colonies in Hungarian churches and moved to
   Slovakian mines and caves to hibernate in winter. The population used
   two main hibernacula, two large nursery roosts and one temporary roost
   but several other roosts were also visited. The area occupied by the
   population was 5180 km(2). R. ferrumequinum living in SE Slovakia and NE
   Hungary formed probably a separate population on the northern edge of
   the species range. This population is a part of the metapopulation of
   the species.}},

Abstract = {{Dung counts are the most commonly used techniques for estimating
   elephant numbers in forests, yet there is considerable scepticism
   concerning their accuracy. Published accounts of dung counts show that
   they give estimates similar to those from other methods for vertebrates
   ranging in size from lizards to elephants. For ungulates, macropods and
   elephants there are strong correlations between estimates from dung
   counts and other methods. Thus, dung counts are as accurate or
   inaccurate as other methods for estimating vertebrate numbers, including
   elephants. Dung counts for elephants give estimates that are as precise
   as, and sometimes more precise than, those from aerial surveys of
   elephants. This is because the variance in dung density is usually low
   and results in a lower than expected variance for the final elephant
   estimate when combined with the variances of defecation and decay rates.
   Dung counts may be more appropriate than aerial surveys for monitoring
   small or declining elephant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Dung decay rates have been used in the past to correct elephant dung
   counts to estimates of population numbers. These assume that the dung is
   in a `steady state' where production rates are equal to disappearance
   rates. The inter-seasonal variation in decay rates, however, has never
   been fully investigated for elephant dung. This study, in the
   Banyang-Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary in SW Cameroon, investigated whether a
   single dung decay rate is really appropriate when converting dung counts
   to population density estimates. A total of 870 fresh elephant
   dung-piles were monitored until they had completely decayed, with at
   least 60 fresh dung piles located each month of the year between July
   1994 to June 1995. The elephant dung decay rate obtained was 55.6\% to
   66.7\% lower than those obtained for the rainforests of Gabon. This has
   implications for using decay rates obtained elsewhere to compute
   elephant densities from dung counts. Statistically significant
   differences were found in the mean duration of dung-piles between
   different months and different seasons. Environmental variables, with
   the exception of rainfall, did not aid in predicting the duration of
   elephant dung-piles. The model of Plumptre \& Harris was used to
   estimate the standing crop of dung at any particular time of the year.
   The results show that, if there was no emigration of elephants from the
   population, then there was only a three-month period when the dung was
   in a `steady state'. If emigration occurred during the wet season as is
   thought to occur then there was no period of `steady state'.}},

Abstract = {{Owl monkeys are small monogamous primates ranging over a wide area
   extending from Panama to the Chaco region of northern Argentina. The
   Chaco, an alluvial plain covering over one million km(2) of Argentina,
   Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay, consists of a mosaic of grasslands,
   savannas, xeric thorn forests, and gallery forests. The region shows
   significant seasonal variation in climate, rainfall, and food
   availability. The goal of this study was to determine the density, size,
   and structure of a population of Aotus azarai in the seasonal gallery
   forests of the eastern Argentinean Chaco. Reported population density,
   as well as group size and composition are based on data collected from
   11 groups contacted on approximately 900 occasions, and observed for
   over 2,000 hours during a three-year period. Group and individual
   densities were 16 groups/km(2) and 64 individuals/km(2), respectively.
   Approximately half of the groups (n = 5) were small groups which had
   three individuals most of the time and never more than four, whereas the
   remaining groups were large groups composed of four or five individuals,
   and sometimes even six or seven individuals. This is the first study of
   A. azarai based on monitoring of a relatively large number of distinct
   groups. Our data suggest that owl monkeys in the seasonal subtropical
   forests of Formosa live at a density as high as those reported for owl
   monkey populations observed in tropical forests. The data also show that
   the social groups in the owl monkey population are of comparable size
   and composition to those characteristic of populations in the tropics.

Abstract = {{The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) is the only indigenous
   Alectoris species in the Iberian Peninsula. Local populations are often
   reinforced with captive-bred individuals, sometimes including hybrids
   between the red-legged partridge and the exotic rock partridge (A.
   graeca). Hunters and wildlife managers oppose releases of hybrids, but
   their identification by visual inspection is difficult beyond the first
   hybrid generation. Here we report the development of a set of RAPD
   markers to identify hybrid partridges using blood samples. We initially
   screened 46 RAPD primers on a subsample of pure red-legged and rock
   partridges, and finally selected six primers that produced 11 markers
   specific of the rock partridge. The selected primers were tested on
   hybrids of different generations bred in captivity. This set of loci
   permitted the detection of 100\% (n = 31) Fl hybrids, 100\% (n = 14)
   backcrosses of Fl to red-legged partridge, all but one (95\%, n = 18)
   hybrid of the second backcross, and 18 out of 27 (67\%, n = 27) hybrids
   of the third backcross. Efficient detection of backcross 1 and 2
   individuals is essential, as these are the ones released for re-stocking
   purposes in hunting states. Although we have only used blood samples,
   other sources of high-quality DNA, such as muscle, should provide the
   same results. Therefore, it would be feasible to monitor the genetic
   purity of partridges in farms and hunting states at different stages of
   production, including embryos, chicks or hunted specimens. (C) 2001

Pages = {{25-32}},

Abstract = {{American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) has been harvested from the
   wild to supply the Asian herbal market for more than 200 years. As a
   CITES Appendix II listed species, ginseng trade has been monitored since
   1975 and evidence for no detrimental effects of harvest is required
   annually by the US government. One kind of evidence gathered to gauge
   harvest effects has been mean root size and age, however the short-term
   nature of the data set limits possible inferences. In this study, 915
   herbarium specimens from 17 herbaria were aged and measured to extend
   the time-transect to 186 years. Nine of 11 size-related traits showed
   statistically significant declines, most of this change occurring since
   ca. 1900. Multivariate analyses confirmed the overall decline in plant
   size. Age of herbarium specimens did not significantly decline during
   the same interval. Plants collected from northern populations did not
   decline in size, while plants from midwestern, Appalachian and southern
   states showed sharp declines in stature. Assuming herbarium specimens
   are representative of a consistent portion of natural populations,
   either direct or indirect effects of environmental change or human
   harvest could explain the rapid change in ginseng stature. Understanding
   the implications of such plant stature changes will require examining
   the effects of size on harvest probability and reproduction in the
   context of population viability analyses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The predacious phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman) is an
   important agent for the biological control of spider mites in deciduous
   fruit orchards in North America and Canada. It would be helpful to
   monitor the fate of released individuals to improve the results of
   introductions of the predators in biological control trials. We have
   used two types of genetic markers, pyrethroid resistance and allozymes,
   for indirect estimation of the survival of N. fallacis introduced in an
   apple orchard in Ontario, Canada. Mite samples were submitted to
   toxicological tests. The polymorphism of four enzymes was studied in
   individual females using an isoelectric focusing technique. A mite
   sample was taken from the field, mass-reared in the laboratory, and
   selected for permethrin resistance. This strain was released on several
   apple trees treated with permethrin, and mite samples were collected
   from the same trees 10 to 90 days later. The genetic composition and the
   insecticide resistance level of this sample were compared to those of
   two other samples from trees where mites had not previously been
   released, either in the same orchard or in a neighboring block. A
   control susceptible strain was compared using mites collected earlier
   from trees on the same site but outside the present experiment. The
   mites collected from the release trees and those from the strain used
   for the releases were found to be genetically closely related, as judged
   from a small genetic distance, and from similar levels of insecticide
   resistance in both samples. The control samples from the nonrelease
   trees were genetically distant from these and displayed low resistance
   levels. These results indicate that the released genotypes established
   and persisted in the release trees for the period of the experiment. The
   utility of the two approaches in assessing the fate of released natural
   enemies is discussed. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{An impact assessment study was undertaken to determine seed predation
   rates by two bruchid beetles, Bruchidus sahlbergi Schilsky and Caryedon
   serratus Olivier, on the invasive shrub Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd. ex
   Eel. The former bruchid was released as a biological control agent for
   A. nilotica, whereas the latter is naturalized in Australia. We
   attempted to determine the dynamics and magnitude of bruchid predation,
   following a number of differing reports of their effectiveness. To
   investigate the importance of seed availability on bruchid numbers, we
   compared seed death in high- and low-seed-density habitats, both before
   and after pods had dropped from tree branches. Bruchid predation was
   initially low (<2\%) in pods on tree branches in both habitats, but
   increased abruptly to 12\% in riparian and 32\% in nonriparian
   exclosures by the third collection date. Bruchid numbers then crashed to
   below 2\% in both habitats, when pods dropped to the ground. B.
   sahlbergi predation later increased markedly (up to 65\%) again at
   high-pod-density sites. No further increase in predation took place
   beyond this level. Seed predation by C. serratus was found to be minimal
   (<5\% of seeds infested) throughout the monitoring period. We suggest
   that seed predation by the bruchids, prior to pod drop and removal by
   cattle, is insufficient to cause major impacts on A. nilotica
   populations. Bruchid seed damage is likely to be significant only in
   situations with low cattle numbers, where cattle cannot remove the
   majority of fallen seed pods or where cattle are excluded. Exclusion of
   cattle from some areas within A. nilotica-invaded landscapes to
   potentially increase bruchid effectiveness is proposed. The demographic
   impact of optimal A. nilotica seed losses is discussed. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Tristan Albatross Diomedea {[}exulans] dabbenena is the most genetically
   distinct of the five taxa that form the Wandering Albatross
   superspecies, and has been Listed as Endangered. It breeds only on Gough
   and Inaccessible Islands in the Tristan da Cunha group, central South
   Atlantic Ocean. The entire breeding population was surveyed during
   1999-2000. A mid-September survey at Cough Island recorded 1,129 chicks,
   equivalent to an annual breeding effort by approximately 1,500 pairs.
   Only one chick was present at Inaccessible Island in 1999, and another
   pair laid an egg in 2000. The annual breeding effort at this island has
   not exceeded three pairs since the 1950s. None were found during an
   incomplete survey at Tristan, where the species bred in the past, but
   birds were seen flying over the island. A complete survey and attempts
   to promote recolonization of Tristan are warranted. Breeding success at
   Gough Island averaged 63\%, and no birds that bred successfully
   attempted to breed the following year. Breeding success was greater and
   less variable in a large colony at Gonydale than at a peripheral colony
   at Tafelkop. Young birds returned to the island after 3-4 years (4-5
   years old), and the modal age of first breeding was 8 years, with some
   individuals breeding as young as 6 years. Most chicks (81\%) recruited
   to their natal colony, but some recruited to colonies up to 3 km from
   their natal site. Among adults, fidelity to partners and breeding colony
   was high. Of nine birds recovered away from the island, at least four
   were killed by longline fishing. Despite its known mortality on
   longlines, the Gough Island census exceeded demipopulation estimates
   from the 1970s and early 1980s, possibly due to incomplete coverage by
   previous surveys and a poor breeding season in 1998. Given the lack of
   evidence for a population decrease, Tristan Albatross should be listed
   as Vulnerable. It is the third rarest albatross species, however, and
   its population size warrants monitoring. We provide guidelines for
   repeatable censuses at Gough Island.}},

Abstract = {{A national survey of breeding Barn Owls was undertaken between 1995 and
   1997 using intensive fieldwork methods within a stratified sample of
   1100 2 x 2-km survey squares selected at random from those available.
   Each year, fieldwork was divided into two sessions: one to locate
   potential nest-sites (winter session) and one to determine occupancy of
   these sites (summer session). Fieldworkers spent an average of 30 hours
   on fieldwork within each survey square. The survey produced national
   population estimates of 2830 (95\% confidence intervals: 1952-3761)
   breeding pairs for 1995, 3967 (95\% CI: 2785-5252) for 1996 and 3951
   (95\% CI: 2769-5214) for 1997. Analysis taking account of the poor
   coverage in certain regions of high Barn Owl density in 1995 suggests
   that a population estimate of 3480 would be more accurate for that year.
   Regional and temporal variations in estimates were examined and
   interpreted in relation to Barn Owl productivity and ecology. Validation
   of fieldwork efficiency was carried out within a random selection of the
   available survey tetrads, demonstrating that fieldworkers achieved a
   high degree of survey reliability. This paper provides a baseline
   population estimate and standardized, repeatable methods, allowing
   future population changes to be monitored effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of adult flight patterns of the blueberry maggot fly,
   Rhagoletis mendax Curran, in New Jersey, indicated that the adults are
   active over a much longer period than previously reported. Captures on
   Pherocon AM traps over two seasons in wild sites and commercial fields
   of highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L. (Ericaceae), showed that
   adult flies are present for most of the period from early July to early
   November. Trap captures in wild sites peaked during July-August, whereas
   in some commercial fields, peak captures were recorded in September.
   Emergence patterns were determined by collecting pupae from a wild site
   and a commercial field at the rime of peak fruit infestation. The
   following year, the wild-site and commercial-field populations showed
   distinct emergence periods that were in broad agreement with trap
   captures at these locations. Comparison of an allozyme locus, using
   individuals collected in commercial blueberry fields, both on Pherocon
   AM traps and from infested Fruit, confirmed that these populations were
   R. mendax and not any of the sibling species with a. similar flight
   period. These data show that there are considerable phenological
   differences between some R, mendax populations. Given this plasticity,
   current debates on evolutionary mechanisms in flies of the genus
   Rhagoletis Loew should consider that the Flight period of R. mendax is
   probably neither a major limiting factor in the use of hosts with
   different fruiting schedules nor an effective premating isolation
   mechanism with respect to other sibling species.}},

Abstract = {{Loose and covered smut of oat are effectively controlled through the use
   of resistant cultivars or carbathiin seed treatment in Canada. The
   potential for development of carbathiin-insensitive genotypes or of
   races with new virulence genes or new virulence gene combinations makes
   it desirable to regularly monitor the pathogen populations to detect
   changes. This study was conducted to define the virulence spectrum and
   carbathiin sensitivity of isolates of Ustilago avenae (Pers.) Rostr. and
   Ustilago kolleri Wille in Canada. Smutted oat panicles were collected
   from 17 farm fields in Manitoba and Saskatchewan during annual surveys
   from 1995 to 1999. Four more collections were obtained from
   collaborators in Ontario and Alberta. Nineteen of the collections were
   identified as U. avenae and two were identified as U. kolleri. All the
   isolates were found to be sensitive to the fungicide carbathiin at 1
   mug/mL, using a petri dish test. The virulence of the smut isolates was
   determined using the Canadian oat smut differential set. Eleven races,
   virulent on 3-10 differential host lines, were identified from the 19
   isolates of U. avenae, and 2 races, virulent on 5 and 7 differential
   host lines, respectively, were identified from the 2 isolates of U.
   kolleri. None of the races were virulent on the oat differential lines
   Fulgham, Camas, or Markton or the oat cultivars AC Medallion, AC
   Assiniboia, AC Belmont, AC Preakness, or Tibor, but races virulent to
   cultivars AC Lotta, CDC Boyer, and Derby were detected. Carbathiin seed
   treatment and current resistant oat cultivars are still effective for
   the control of loose and covered smut of oats in Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Canada's forests cover more than 418 million hectares, 45\% of our land
   area, and represent a diverse range of ecosystems including mixed
   hardwood stands in southeastern Canada, temperate rain forests of
   British Columbia and dwarf forests of the arctic tundra. The size and
   diversity of the forest presents interesting challenges to forest health
   assessment. The Canadian Forest service (CFS) now recognizes that
   ``forest health{''} encompasses more than the incidence and distribution
   of insect pests and disease-causing organisms and that forests are
   perceived as healthy when ecological processes are maintained and pest
   populations are operating within natural ranges of variability.
   Different stakeholders are also seen as having varying definitions of
   forest ``health.{''} For example, the forest industry may focus on
   health as it relates to timber productivity, whereas environmental
   advocates may focus on ecological integrity. The assessment and
   reporting of forest health in Canada is currently being accomplished
   through cooperation among federal and provincial governments, academia,
   and industry. An inter agency program is being developed where
   broad-scale geographic coverage will be linked to national forest
   inventory plots, current pest conditions monitored by provincial
   agencies, research on specific disturbance agents carried out
   regionally, and an overall synthesis of national forest health
   undertaken by the Canadian Forest Service.}},

Abstract = {{Current recommended ecotoxicological tests with the parthenogenetic
   springtail Folsomia candida using standard OECD soil do not allow for
   continuous monitoring during the exposure period. Effects of chemicals
   cannot be determined until the end of the experiment (typically after 4
   weeks), since the animals stay below the soil surface. In this study, F.
   candida were maintained on a plaster of Paris/graphite substrate for 7
   weeks and were supplied with an aqueous suspension of yeast contaminated
   with Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn as nitrate salts. Growth rate, time to first
   batch of eggs, quantity of food consumed, and the presence of graphite
   in the gut (a sign of avoidance of yeast) were all affected by metal
   contaminated diets. The relative toxicities of Cd:Cu:Pb:Zn in the yeast
   were 1.0:1.07:12.0:4.3, respectively ton a weight basis) with Cd being
   the most toxic. Internal body concentrations increased, and the
   concentration factor (metal concentration in F. candida/metal
   concentration in yeast) decreased with increasing metal exposure. In
   general, metals are much less toxic when added to the food off. candida
   than when incorporated into soil in standard tests. It is suggested that
   Collembola have a greater tolerance of metals in the diet since they
   avoid contaminated food, and are able to excrete assimilated metals at
   moulting via exfoliation of the midgut epithelium where the elements are
   retained as part of a storage-detoxification system. The methodology
   described in this article allows effects on growth to be observed as
   early as 7 days after the beginning of the experiment. (C) 2001 Academic

Title = {{MTBE in California drinking water: An analysis of patterns and trends}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decade, there has been much publicity surrounding the
   impact of Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) on drinking water supplies in
   the United States. In California, the presence of MTBE in groundwater
   and drinking water has led to a ban on the future use of MTBE in
   gasoline. Other states, such as those in the northeast, are also seeking
   ways to reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE due to perceived threats to
   the environment and public health. Despite claims about the incidence of
   MTBE in drinking water, no comprehensive characterization has been
   conducted on the available drinking water monitoring data. This paper
   provides a detailed analysis of the MTBE drinking water data compiled by
   the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) from 1995 to 2000.
   We find that MTBE was detected in about 1.3\% of all drinking water
   samples, 2.5\% of drinking water sources, and 3.7\% of drinking water
   systems in California over this 6-year period. Our analysis reveals that
   many drinking water sources are not sampled routinely for MTBE, and in
   those sources that appear to be affected by MTBE, the compound is not
   consistently detected. The majority of MTBE detections are also
   concentrated in several geographic areas, which contain about 9-21\% of
   the total California population. Average detected MTBE concentrations
   have decreased significantly since 1995 and 1996, ranging from 5 to 15
   ppb over the last 3 years depending on the outcome of interest. Of the
   samples in which MTBE was present above the analytical detection limit,
   the concentrations in approximately 73\% of drinking water samples and
   86\% of drinking water sources and systems were below the State's
   primary health-based standard of 13 ppb. Our findings suggest that,
   although some drinking water supplies in California have been affected
   by MTBE, the majority of drinking water sources and systems either have
   not been affected at all or contain MTBE at concentrations below levels
   that are likely to be of health concern. (C) 2001 AEHS.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to report on the testing of responses of
   multimetric macroin-vertebrate and habitat indices to common
   disturbances to streams: stream habitat alteration, excessive sediment,
   and elevated metals concentrations. Seven macroinvertebrate community
   metrics were combined into a macroinvertebrate biotic index (MBI), and
   11 channel morphology, riparian, and substrate features were combined
   into a habitat index. Indices were evaluated by comparing the habitat
   results to fish population surveys and comparing the macroinvertebrate
   results to habitat ratings, percent fine sediments measured by Wolman
   pebble counts, and copper concentrations. Macroinvertebrate scores
   decreased with increasing percentages of fine sediments measured either
   across the bankfull or instream channel widths. Macroinvertebrate scores
   decreased with increasing copper. One metric, richness of Ephemeroptera,
   Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa, was more responsive to both
   copper and sediment than was the multimetric MBI. Habitat scores
   corresponded well with the age class structure of salmonids, but not
   with that of benthic sculpins. Both salmonid and sculpin age classes
   declined with increasing percentages of fine sediments. The decline was
   graded with the sculpin age classes, whether fine sediments were
   measured across the instream or bankfull channel, whereas salmonids
   consistently responded only to the instream fine sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Despite tremendous efforts toward regulating and controlling
   tropospheric ozone (O-3) formation, a large portion of the U.S.
   population presently lives in environments where air quality exceeds
   both 1- and 8-h National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set for
   O-3 High O-3 concentrations; annually cost the United; States billions
   of dollars in excessive human;health costs, reduced crop yields,and
   ecological damage. This paper,describes a regional networking of O-3
   monitoring sites, operated by the public, that used simplified passive
   sampling devices (PSDs). In collaboration with EPA Region 6, a lay
   network (i.e., Passive Ozone Network of Dallas, acronym POND),
   consisting of 30 PSD sites in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex, a
   region representing 16 counties, successfully measured daily ozone
   during 8 weeks of the 1998 high ozone season. It was demonstrated that
   the concerned public, when properly trained, could successfully operate
   a large PSD network that requires daily sample handling and weekly
   mailing procedures, even from remote sites. Data treatment bf the 2880
   POND measurements included (i) high correlations with collocated
   continous monitoring data {[}r range =0.95-0.97], (ii) daily O-3 contour
   mapping of the 24 000 km(2) area, and (iii) a ranking of O-3 severity in
   12 peri-urban Counties for guidance in siting additional monitors. With
   a new 8-h NAAQS standard now in place, a cost-effective network such as
   POND could aid regional airshed models in generating meaningful guidance
   for O-3 state implementation plans (SIPs) by providing input that is:
   representative of both rural and urban sites.}},

Abstract = {{Sludge produced during the treatment of wastewater is being used as
   fertilizer in several Gulf countries. The Water and Sewage Authority of
   Saudi Arabia has targeted the reuse of the total amount of sludge in the

   as they contain a large number of pathogens and parasites. Little
   information is available on the microbial characteristics of sludge
   produced in wastewater treatment plants operating in this region.
   Variations in the population densities measured by Standard Plate Count,
   total coliform, fecal coliform, coliphage, and Clostridium perfringens
   present in the sludge, were monitored during a one year study at
   Al-Khobar wastewater treatment plant so that the effect of seasonal
   variations on the tate of these five indicator microorganisms could be
   investigated. This paper covers an evaluation of the fate of indicator
   microorganisms in the drying sludge. Insight gained in this study will

Abstract = {{A data logger originally developed for the study of homing routes in
   birds was adapted for monitoring the activity patterns of the European
   pond turtle Emys orbicularis and tested on wild specimens from a Central
   Italian population. The set of sensors included a compass, water
   switches, an activity sensor and a thermocouple. The compass allowed us
   to record the orientation of the turtle's body axis, but also provided
   information on the temporal pattern of activity thus adding to the

   monitoring and improvement, carbon sequestration, phytoremediation and
   basic biological understanding. Whether, and to what degree, poplars and
   willows achieve their potential will depend on coordinated action that
   includes systematic collection of biological materials, establishment of
   an environmental monitoring network based on poplars and willows,
   creation of a ``poplars, willows and water{''} task force to assess
   watershed and riparian rehabilitation tasks, enhanced genome research
   and an advanced, ecosystem-based regulatory framework for poplar and

Abstract = {{Poplars (genus Populus) have emerged as a model organism for forest
   biotechnology, and genetic modification (GM: asexual gene transfer) is
   more advanced for this genus than for any other tree. The goal of this
   paper is to consider the benefits expected from the use of GM poplar
   trees, and the most significant claims made for environmental harm, by
   comparing them to impacts and uncertainties that are generally accepted
   as part of intensive tree culture. We focus on the four traits with
   greatest commercialization potential in the near term: wood
   modification, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, and flowering
   control. After field trials and selection of the top performing trees,
   similar to that during conventional poplar breeding, GM poplars appear
   vigorous and express their new traits reliably. The ecological issues
   expected from use of GM poplars appear similar in scope to those managed
   routinely during conventional plantation culture, which includes the use
   of exotic and hybrid genotypes, short rotations, intensive weed control,
   fertilization, and density control. The single-gene traits under
   consideration for commercial use are unlikely to cause a significant
   expansion in ecological niche, and thus to substantially alter poplar's
   ability to ``invade{''} wild populations. We conclude that the
   ecological risks posed by GM poplars are similar in magnitude, though
   not in detail, to those of routine poplar culture. We also argue that
   the tangible economic and environmental benefits of GM poplars for some
   uses warrant their near-term adoption-if coupled with adaptive research
   and monitoring-so that their economic and ecological benefits, and
   safety, can be studied on commercially and ecologically relevant scales.
   We believe that the growing demand for both wood products and ecological
   services of forests justifies vigorous efforts to increase wood
   production on land socially zoned for tree agriculture, plantations, or
   horticulture. This is the key reason for poplar biotechnology: the
   combination of economic efficiency with reduction of farm and forestry
   impact on the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{We summarize all available locality records by us and others for the
   regal fritillary (Speyeria idalia) during 1970-99 in Wisconsin, where it
   is listed as endangered. Nearly all areas of regular observation (i.e.,
   populations) occurred in clusters of sites. All historical localities.
   and extant populations (or population clusters) were discovered by
   volunteers. The species' historical reputation as localized and scarce
   continues to appear justified, but the paucity of historical data
   precludes further refinement of its statewide status and trend in past
   decades. Regal fritillary habitat has typically been described as native
   prairie grassland. This appears often, but not always, to correlate with
   other factors more strongly associated with regal fritillary
   populations: larger grassland patches more likely to have topographic
   diversity and long-term histories of more favorable land uses (such that
   native flora, if present, has not been destroyed). These other factors,
   without regard for the ``nativeness{''} of the vegetation, have proven
   useful in selecting sites to search for undiscovered populations. We
   also present analyses of our transect survey data from 49 grasslands in
   Wisconsin during 1990-99 for both regal fritillary and the closely
   related but more widespread and abundant Aphrodite fritillary (Speyeria
   aphrodite). Flight period timing varied among years by greater than or
   equal to3 weeks for both fritillaries. These results should be useful
   for designing and interpreting surveys to monitor fritillary
   populations.}},

   the Municipal Service Corporation of the city of Brescia decided to
   acquire a radiation detection portal system. However, the performance of
   such instruments is not sufficiently specified in this type of
   application, so ASM asked the Nuclear Engineering Department of the
   Polytechnic elf Milan to draw up a test protocol and to lead the
   following experimental campaign. A truck trailer and a source container
   were prepared ad hoc, and three different systems underwent a
   sensitivity and a false alarm test. On the basis of the final results,
   the performance characteristics of various monitoring systems in this
   particular application were established with the correct degree of
   accuracy. Health Phys. 80(3):278-284; 2001.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the human health risk
   associated with fish consumption in a contaminated area downstream from
   a mercury processing plant in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The study
   population consisted of fish consumers living in close proximity to the
   u'Mgeni River and the Inanda Dam downstream from the plant. A control
   group was selected from the area upstream from the mercury plant as far
   as the Nagle Dam. Total daily mercury consumption per kilogram body
   weight per day was calculated for each person included in the study.
   These data were compared with the tolerable daily intake standard
   published by the World Health Organization, as well as to the United
   States Environmental Protection Agency's reference dose. Human hair
   samples obtained from the study population and a control group were
   analysed for mercury content. The results of the risk estimation
   indicated that the study population is at risk. Human hair samples,
   however, indicated that dangerous levels of mercury had not yet been
   consumed. Humans in this study area could be subject to an excessive
   health risk from mercury as a result of their fish consumption. Fish
   mercury levels in the contaminated area should be monitored closely.}},

Abstract = {{Shallow lakes and wetlands are highly complex systems in which actions
   affecting a single compartment can have repercussions far away from the
   target parameter and those directly related species. In a large-scale
   study of the Esteros del Ibera wetland in Argentina, researchers have
   constructed a set of qualitative models with the objective of further
   understanding the interrelations between management actions and impacts
   on key abiotic and biotic ecosystem variables. The two qualitative
   models that have been developed relate to past and future modification
   of the wetland biotic and abiotic characteristics. The first model
   examines possible secondary effects of the recently successful ban on
   caiman hunting. The second model studies the potential impacts of
   growing regional economic development on water quality and biodiversity
   of the wetland. The results are qualitative, indicating where further
   analysis and modelling would be best concentrated.
   The output of the two models shows that particular populations
   (piscivorous waterfowl) and compartments (littoral aquatic macrophytes)
   are more likely to be sensitive to potential modifications in the
   ecosystem. This is the result of a number of feedback mechanisms that
   transfer the effects of management and resource-use practices to these
   compartments. Based on such observations, more attention has been given
   to creating monitoring instruments for these variables.}},

Abstract = {{1. The effect of weather on the size of British butterfly populations
   was studied using national weather records and the Butterfly Monitoring
   Scheme (BMS), a national database that has measured butterfly abundance
   since 1976.
   2. Strong associations between weather and population fluctuations and
   trends were found in 28 of 31 species studied The main positive
   associations were with warm summer (especially June) temperature during
   the current and previous year, low rainfall in the current year and high
   rainfall in the previous year. Most bivoltine species benefited from
   warm June weather in the current year, three spring species and two that
   overwinter as adults benefited from warm weather in the previous summer,
   and most species with moist or semi-shaded habitats increased following
   high rainfall and cooler weather in the previous year.
   3. Simple models incorporating weather variables and density effects
   were constructed for each species using the first 15 years' population
   data(1976-90) These fitted the observed data for that period well
   (median R-2 = 70\%). Models were less good at predicting changes in
   abundance over the next 7 years (1991-97), although significant
   predictive success was obtained.
   4. Parameter values of models were then adjusted to incorporate the full
   22-year data-run For the eight species whose models had best predicted
   population changes or fitted the data well (R-2 > 85\%), models were run
   from 1767 to 1997, using historical weather records, to `predict' trends
   in abundance over the past two centuries. For three species it was
   possible to compare predicted past trends with contemporary accounts of
   abundance since 1800. In each case, the match between predictions and
   these qualitative assessments was good.
   5. Models were also used to predict future changes in abundance, using
   three published scenarios for climate change. Most, but not all, species
   are predicted to increase in the UK under warmer climates, a few species
   stayed stable, and only one species - the agricultural pest Pieris
   brassicae (Cabbage White) - is predicted to decline.}},

Abstract = {{1. Theory suggests that territorial species should share many of the
   same dynamical characteristics as metapopulations, including
   asynchronous local dynamics, potential for stochastic extinction of the
   population when rates of successful dispersal fall below mortality risk,
   and critical importance of the ratio of suitable to unsuitable habitat
   for long-term persistence. These propositions were tested on a
   population of beavers (Castor canadensis Kuhl) in Algonquin Provincial
   Park, Ontario, which has been continuously monitored over 11 years.
   2. Results showed that the total population was considerably less
   variable than local abundance at 14 beaver colonies, due to asynchrony
   among local populations. This suggests that local ecological
   interactions were more important in determining year-to-year variation
   in beaver numbers than broad-scale environmental processes, such as
   weather.
   3. Of the local colonies, 20\% were never abandoned over ii years,
   although there was considerable turnover among adults. Offspring
   production exceeded adult abundance at five source colonies, which did
   not quite compensate for negative net production at nine sink colonies.
   These observations were consistent with predictions of spatially
   structured models of territoriality incorporating local variation in
   habitat suitability. Mean colony size and probability of recurrence from
   year-to-year were associated with local food availability, indicating
   that trophic interactions were important in determining local population
   dynamics.
   4. The beaver population in Algonquin declined steadily over the study
   period, however, suggesting that spatial and demographic processes were
   insufficient to stabilize abundance over time. This is consistent with
   predictions of spatially structured models of territoriality in which
   suitable and unsuitable habitats are interspersed. It is hypothesized
   that long-term decline in habitat suitability is induced by acceleration
   of woody plant succession due to selective foraging by beavers.}},

Abstract = {{Among lepidopteran insects, the female-produced sex pheromones are the
   most widely used chemical stimuli for pest management by (i) mating
   disruption, and (ii) monitoring adult insect populations in agricultural
   crops. Sesamia nonagrioides is one of the main pests on maize crops
   around the Mediterranean area and monitoring adult populations with
   synthetic sex pheromone is of great interest. The technique used
   involved field trapping with synthetic pheromone blend. The reliability
   of the technique is directly related to the trap shape and pheromone
   blends. Universal Moth Trap(R) (UM trap. Biosystemes, france) and
   Service Regional de la protection des Vegetaux (SRPV) traps baited with
   either synthetic pheromone blend or virgin females were evaluated in two
   commercial maize fields (var.cecilia) (Belleserre. Tarn. France) to
   determine the potential use of synthetic lures in monitoring S.
   nonagrioides populations in maize field. The study showed that SRPV
   traps baited with synthetic pheromone blend caught significantly more S.
   nonagrioides males than UM traps baited with the same blend, indicating
   the efficiency of the SRPV traps in monitoring field population of S.
   nonagrioides. The study also showed that the synthetic pheromone-baited
   SRPV trap caught three times less adult males than the same traps baited
   with virgin females indicating that the synthetic blend was less
   attractive than the natural blend released by virgin females. However.
   despite the lower number of catches in the SRPV traps baited with
   synthetic pheromones there was a significant and positive relationship
   between the number of catches in SRPV traps baited with the synthetic
   pheromone and with the females. This result indicates that synthetic
   pheromones can be used as baits in SRPV traps to monitor S. nonagrioides
   adult population in commercial maize crops. Nevertheless, to use the
   synthetic pheromone to monitor S. nonagrioides population effectively in
   the field, further refinement and improvement of the synthetic blend
   should be carried out in order to obtain a blend that is equally as
   attractive as the natural blend released by virgin females.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing areas of a guanaco population were shared with introduced
   livestock in a protected area of Northern Patagonia. The diet of
   ungulates and the availability of food were compared to recognize
   interspecific overlaps and to detect potential plant depletions.
   Seasonal faecal samples were analysed by microhistology, and food
   availability was analysed by point-quadrat transects in sandy and rocky
   habitats. Large ungulates were classified as `strictly grazers', while
   small ungulates as `grazer-browsers'. Food limitations constrained
   ungulate feeding tendencies, in agreement with the selective quality
   hypothesis. Shared use with a preference of scarce items, i.e. most
   forbs and four grasses, suggest they are at risk of disappearance by
   overgrazing. Main dietary items annually shared were the grass Poa and
   the camephyte Hyalis, the conservation of which would be essential for
   the guanaco population. Despite their high dietary diversity, guanacos
   could be affected especially by shared food use with sheep and horses in
   sandy habitats. Cattle would be the most affected by shared use with
   horses, sheep or goats. Fires and woody plant extractions caused a
   decrease of shrubby stratum, food diversity and patchiness, and could
   force an increase of competitive risks. Management priorities should be
   to monitor the plant cover and diversity, discourage a livestock
   carrying increase, avoid shrub extraction, and control fire generation.

Abstract = {{This study investigates the relationship between ambient fine particle
   pollution and impaired cardiac autonomic control in the elderly. Heart
   rate variability (HRV) among 56 elderly (mean age 82) nonsmoking
   residents of a retirement center in Baltimore County, Maryland, was
   monitored for 4 weeks, from July 27 through August 22, 1998. The weather
   was seasonally mild (63 - 84 degreesF mean daily temperature) with low
   to moderate levels of fine particles ( PM2.5 < 50 mug/m(3)). Two groups
   of approximately 30 subjects were examined on alternate days. A spline
   mixed - effects model revealed a negative relationship between outdoor
   24 - h average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and high- frequency (HF)
   HRV that was consistent with our earlier Baltimore study for all but 2
   days. These 2 days were the only days with significant precipitation in
   combination with elevated PM2.5 They were also unusual in that back -
   trajectory of their air masses was distinctly different from those on
   the other study days, emanating from the direction of rural
   Pennsylvania. Mixed - effects analysis for all 24 study days showed a
   small negative association of outdoor PM2.5 with HF HRV ( - 0.03 change
   in log{[}HF HRV] for a 10 mug/m(3) increment in PM2.5) after adjustment
   for age, sex, cardiovascular status, trend, maximum temperature, average
   dew point temperature, random subject intercepts, and autocorrelated
   residuals. After excluding study days 4 and 5. this association was
   strengthened ( - 0.07 change in log{[}HF HRV] for 10 mug/m(3) PM2.5,
   95\% CI -0.13 to - 0.02) and was similar to that obtained in an earlier
   study ( - 0. 12 change in log{[}HF HRV ] for a 10 mug/m(3) increment in
   outdoor PM2.5, 95\% CI - 0.24 to - 0.00) {[}Liao D., Cai J.. Rosamond

Abstract = {{Backpack radio-tags can be used to monitor survival of raptors for
   several years after fledging, but may reduce survival if a poor fit
   results from subjective judgments. We present an attachment method that
   can use bird measurements to predict harness sizes. Relationships
   between body mass of Saker Falcons and harness size predicted the size
   for smaller falcon species. Harnesses were fitted when birds had reached
   full size in the nest, which required age estimation at a previous visit
   to predict a fledging date. Equations based on wing length provided
   objective aging of nestlings. A pump-pressured water gun aided capture
   of young falcons and toggle-loops restrained the feet during marking.
   Saker Falcons with radio-tags and others marked only with leg bands and
   implanted transponders had the same recapture rate (7\%) in autumn,
   indicating similar survival. This retrap rate should be adequate to
   estimate harvest rates and population sizes for Saker Falcons.}},

Abstract = {{Paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) movements and habitat use were monitored
   in the Keystone Reservoir System, Oklahoma during 1996-1998 to determine
   reproductive activity patterns. Paddlefish spring spawning migrations
   were more dependent on water flows than water temperature or
   photoperiod. Paddlefish moved up the Cimarron River and Arkansas River
   in 1997 and 1998 when spring flows increased. However, they did not
   migrate up the rivers in 1996, a year with extremely low flows. Suitable
   spawning substrate was found in the Salt Fork River, a major tributary
   of the Arkansas River, and the tailwaters of Kaw Dam on the Arkansas
   River. Paddlefish were located over suitable spawning substrate in the
   Salt Fork River; however, no larvae were collected. Although paddlefish
   migrate up the Cimarron River in spring, minimal spawning habitat may
   limit successful spawning in that river. In 1998, paddlefish moved into
   the Salt Fork River rather than. the Kaw Dam tailwaters, presumably
   because there was limited flow from Kaw Dam that spring. Paddlefish in
   the Keystone Reservoir system appear to have adapted to the high spring
   water temperatures and fluctuating flows enabling successful
   reproduction.
   The paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) is native to large midwestern rivers
   in the central United States, including the Arkansas River and the
   Cimarron River, which combine to make Keystone Reservoir in northcentral
   Oklahoma. Paddlefish populations have diminished in numbers during the
   last century due in part to destruction of spawning grounds and dam
   construction (Graham 1997). Paddlefish traditionally migrate up rivers
   in spring (Unkenholz 1982, Russell 1986), where spawning occurs in
   flowing water over silt-free gravel (Purkett 1961) at water temperatures
   of 10-18 degrees C (Pitman 1991). However, gravel is sparse in prairie
   rivers of the southcentral and southwestern U.S., and paddlefish may be
   required to spawn over other substrates (Bonislawsky 1977).
   In the last 50 years, impoundments have, in many cases, diminished the
   size of paddlefish populations because they block fish from their
   spawning grounds or inundate the spawning areas altogether. In addition,
   river stage and discharge are usually highly regulated and may not mimic
   natural spring flow regimes (Unkenholz 1986), which may prohibit
   paddlefish spawning. However, some paddlefish populations, including the
   one in Keystone Reservoir, have survived and even flourished (Paukert
   1998). Our objective was to determine spring movement patterns
   associated with reproductive activity of paddlefish in the Keystone
   Reservoir system, Oklahoma.}},

   other species of raptors were made at Ware, a raptor-migration watchsite
   in central Nepal, on nine days (27 October - 4 November) in autumn 1999.
   Totals of 821 migrating Steppe Eagles (15.2 birds/h) and 129 other
   migrating raptors (2.4 birds/h), including the globally vulnerable
   Lesser Kestrel (Falco naumanni) (0.2 birds/h), were seen at the

   be distinguished as migrants versus local residents also were seen, but
   were not included in the count. Most autumn migrants at Khare are
   believed to represent individuals from populations of raptors that breed
   in central and eastern Asia and overwinter in southeastern and
   southwestern Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and Africa. Raptor migration
   appears to be a regular and predictable phenomenon at the site, leading
   us to recommend its use by local residents, as a source of ecotourism
   revenue and as a focal point for environmental-education activity fur
   school children, and by raptor conservationists, as a continentally

   test population was collected from Ta-Soa County, Tri-Yok District,
   Kanchanaburi Province, in western Thailand and referred to as a wild
   population. Results showed that females of both young and wild test
   populations rapidly escaped from direct contact with DDT, deltamethrin,
   and lambdacyhalothrin. Lambdacyhalothrin exhibited the strongest
   irritant effect on female mosquitoes, followed by DDT and deltamethrin.
   Fewer females escaped from test chambers without direct contact with
   treated surfaces but the response was significantly different from that
   of the controls (P < 0.05). The noncontact response is indicative of a
   noncontact repellent action. Both contact irritancy and noncontact
   repellency are involved in An. minimus escape responses. Experimental
   hut studies that include monitoring of house-entering populations of An.
   minimus are needed for a meaningful assessment of noncontact repellent
   actions.}},

Abstract = {{A field trial using the entomopathogen Bacillus sphaericus against Culex
   quinquefasciatus was conducted in a district of Recife, Brazil, an area
   with a high prevalence of lymphatic filariasis. In this urban area more
   than 2,500 Cx. quinquefasciatus breeding sites within a 1.2-km(2) area
   were found and subsequently submitted to a long-term treatment with B.
   sphaericus. To evaluate the impact of treatment on the densities of Cx.
   quinquefasciatus preimaginal forms, 26 breeding sites, representative of
   the major site types found in that area, were monitored for 3 years.
   Parameters such as mean and maximum densities of larval population as
   well as the frequency of infested sites were recorded before, during,
   and after the trial. The level of each parameter was greatly reduced
   during the treatment period, particularly in the 2nd treatment year. A
   low density of Cx. quinquefasciatus was also maintained throughout the
   last year, in the absence of treatment. Analysis of the data reported
   here confirms B. sphaericus as a very effective larvicide against Cx.
   quinquefasciatus despite the optimal environmental conditions for
   mosquito proliferation in the urban area of Recife.}},

Abstract = {{Control strategies were evaluated over a 6-month period in a home
   simulation model comprising a series of similar carpeted pens, housing
   matched groups of six cats, in which the life-cycle of the flea
   Ctenocephalides felis felis Bouche (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) had been
   established. Additional adult fleas were placed on the cats at intervals
   to mimic acquisition of extraneous fleas from outside the home.
   Treatment strategies included a single subcutaneous deposition of
   injectable lufenuron supported by initial treatments with a short-acting
   insecticidal spray, or monthly topical applications of imidacloprid or
   fipronil. An untreated control group indicated that conditions were
   suitable for flea replication and development. Controls had to be combed
   on 18 occasions to remove excessive flea burdens and two developed
   allergic reactions. Lufenuron cats were combed once and required two
   insecticidal treatments in the first month to achieve control. Even so,
   small flea burdens were constantly present thereafter. Imidacloprid and
   fipronil treatments appeared to give virtually complete control
   throughout. Single fleas were found on imidacloprid cats on two
   occasions, whereas none were recovered from fipronil cats at any time
   after the first treatment. Tracer cats were used to monitor
   re-infestation rates at the end of the trial period. Small numbers of
   host-seeking fleas were demonstrated in all treatment pens, indicating
   that total eradication had not been accomplished. It is concluded that
   the home environment simulation model incorporating tracer animals could
   provide a powerful tool for studying flea population dynamics under
   controlled conditions but improved techniques are needed for quantifying
   other off-host life-cycle stages.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable estimates of survival and mortality rates for mountain liens
   (Puma concolor) have been difficult to obtain because of their low
   densities and secretive behavior. We estimated annual survival and
   cause-specific mortality rates for a heavily exploited mountain lion
   population in southeastern Arizona from February 1991 to April 1994. We
   monitored 24 adult radio-collared mountain lions weekly We used
   MICROMORT to determine daily, annual, and overall survival rates.
   Radio-collared mountain lions had low annual survival (0.62).
   Depredation control was the leading cause of mortality. Survival rates
   of female (0.67) and male (0.58) lions did not differ Because of the
   high mortality in the area of depredation control, this area may
   represent a mortality sink.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the efficacy of a mitigation project in Avra Valley Arizona,
   established to provide wildlife access across the barrier created by a
   canal, the Central Arizona Project (CAP). We monitored movements of 17
   radio-collared desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) to
   determine if deer were using the corridor for access across the canal
   and the 26-km wide valley We also determined frequency of corridor use
   by desert mule deer relative to surrounding lands. Four deer crossed the
   canal but stayed within 500 m of the crossing site. One deer traversed
   the valley via the corridor. Two of these deer used crossing areas not
   in the designated corridor. Overall, 22.4\% of deer locations were in
   the corridor. The corridor currently serves as a link with other
   undeveloped lands to provide movement for animals seeking to cross Avra
   Valley, but some lands outside the corridor are scheduled for
   development for agriculture. With increasing pressures from an urban
   population, the corridor may prove to be of greater value in the future.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated cassava bacterial blight (CBB) infection in an pair-cross
   population of 150 individuals derived from an intra-specific cross
   between two noninbred cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) lines. The
   replicated trials were carried out in the field under high disease
   pressure over two consecutive crop cycles. Evaluations were conducted at
   4 and 7 months after planting for the two cycles. Simple regression
   analysis and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test revealed
   that eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were involved in resistance.
   We detected changes in QTLs from crop cycle to crop cycle. The pathogen
   population (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv, manihotis) was also monitored
   over the period, using a restriction fragment length polymorphism probe
   and pathogenic tests. Changes in QTL detection over the 2 years could be
   correlated with changes in pathogen population structure. One QTL,
   located in linkage group D, was conserved over the two crop cycles, and
   in field to greenhouse evaluations. This study thus identified molecular
   markers useful for marker assisted-selection, a technique that can
   accelerate the long, multiple-season process of breeding for CBB
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Composting is commonly used as an effective means of stabilizing
   wastewater biosolids and reducing pathogens to very low concentrations.
   However, it has been shown that under certain conditions Salmonella can
   regrow in previously composted biosolids. Growth of seeded Salmonella
   typhimurium in composted biosolids ranging from two weeks to two years
   maturity was monitored. Results from sterile and non-sterile composted
   biosolids were compared. Seeded S. typhimurium colonized rapidly in
   sterilized biosolids reaching a maximum population density of more than
   10(8) g(-1). Growth of seeded S. typhimurium was suppressed in
   non-sterilized compost with a maximum population density of less than
   10(3) g(-1). There was a significant decline in the growth rate of
   seeded Salmonella in sterilized compost when the compost was stored,
   suggesting that bio-available nutrients declined with storage. However,
   in non-sterilized compost this was not the case. This suggests that the
   indigenous microflora play a significant role in suppression of
   Salmonella regrowth in composted biosolids. There was a strong negative
   correlation (-0.85) between the Salmonella inactivation rate and the
   maturity of compost in non-sterilized compost. The Salmonella
   inactivation rate was seven times higher in biosolids composting for two
   weeks as compared to compost stored for two years. This suggests that
   the antagonistic effect of indigenous microorganisms towards Salmonella
   declined with compost storage. It was concluded that all composted
   biosolids had a Salmonella regrowth potential. However, the indigenous
   microflora significantly reduced this regrowth potential, Long-term
   storage of compost is not recommended as this map increase the pathogen
   regrowth potential. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Four three-dimensional lysimeters were established in a pilot laboratory
   with the same medium sand and either an aggregate-laden (AL) or
   aggregate-free (AF) infiltration surface and a 60- or 90-cm soil vadose
   zone depth to ground water. During 48 weeks of operation, each lysimeter
   was dosed 4 rimes daily with septic tank effluent (STE) at 5 cm/d (AL)
   or 8.4 cm/d (AF). Weekly monitoring was done to characterize the STE,
   percolate flow and composition, and water content distributions within
   the lysimeters. Bromide tracer tests were completed at weeks 0, 8, and
   45 and during the latter two times, ice nucleating active (INA) bacteria
   and MS-2 and PRD-1 bacteriophages were used as bacterial and viral
   surrogates. After 48 weeks, soil cores were collected and analyzed for
   chemical and microbial properties. The observations made during this
   study revealed a dynamic, interactive behavior for hydraulic and
   purification processes that were similar for all four lysimeters. Media
   utilization and bromide retention times increased during the first two
   months of operation with the median bromide breakthrough exceeding one
   day at start-up and increasing to two days or more. Purification
   processes were gradually established over four months or longer, after
   which there were high removal efficiencies (>90\%) for organic
   constituents, microorganisms, and virus, but only limited removal of
   nutrients. Soil core analyses revealed high biogeochemical activity
   within the infiltrative zone from 0 to 15 cm depth. All four lysimeters
   exhibited comparable behavior and there were no significant differences
   in performance attributable to infiltrative surface character or soil
   depth. It is speculated that the comparable performance is due to a
   similar and sufficient degree of soil clogging genesis coupled with
   bioprocesses that effectively purified the wastewater effluent given the
   adequate retention times and high volumetric utilization's of the sand
   media. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Created ponds were built as an experiment in mitigating the loss of a
   wetland to construction. We monitored amphibian breeding population
   sizes and juvenile recruitment at these ``created ponds{''} for 8.5
   years and compared the populations to those observed at the original
   wetland, Sun Bay (less than or equal to 600 m from the created ponds),
   and at an undisturbed reference wetland, Rainbow Bay. Some amphibians
   continued breeding migrations to Sun Bay even after it was filled with
   soil. Few of the anuran colonists of the created ponds had been
   previously captured at Sun Bay, but many of the salamander colonists had
   been collected. The created ponds became permanent, whereas Sun Bay and
   Rainbow Bay were temporary ponds. Juveniles of two salamander species
   and 10 species of frogs and toads metamorphosed and emigrated from the
   created ponds during the study. By the final years of the study, the
   community structure of adult and juvenile amphibians differed among the
   three created ponds, as well as between these ponds and the prior
   amphibian community at the filled wetland and the contemporaneous
   community at the reference wetland. Mean size at metamorphosis was
   smaller at the created ponds than at the reference site for two species
   of frogs, whereas the opposite was true for two salamanders. We conclude
   that the created ponds provided partial mitigation for the loss of the
   natural amphibian breeding habitat. Differences between the created
   ponds and the natural wetlands were likely related to differences in
   their hydrologic regimes, size, substrates, vegetation, and surrounding
   terrestrial habitats and to the limited availability of colonists of
   some species.}},

Abstract = {{Because ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) are an important
   wildlife resource in agricultural ecosystems, we reviewed the role of
   predators on pheasant population dynamics and suggest management options
   to ameliorate predation. Predator reduction programs hare the potential
   to increase survival and recruitment, but these parameters decrease once
   predator control ceases. Extensive application of predator reductions
   may be ethically questionable, and habitat management directed at
   moderating the effects of predators at the landscape scale is expensive.
   An extensive distribution of cover during the nesting and brood-rearing
   periods can increase pheasant recruitment. Federal agricultural and
   conservation programs can be used to accomplish many of these landscape
   habitat improvements, but federal and state agencies must provide the
   technical assistance to deliver the program options to producers. New
   federal farm programs aimed at improving avian survival and recruitment
   must have an evaluation and monitoring component built in to determine
   their effectiveness.}},

   goats (Oreamnos americanus) seen during aerial surveys to the actual
   number of goats in a marked population in west-central Alberta from 1989
   to 1999. On average, 69.5\% of the goats were seen during aerial
   surveys, but the proportion of goats seen in any one survey ranged from
   55 to 84\% (CV=12.3\%). Observed and actual numbers of adult goats were
   best correlated. Yearlings and kids appeared difficult to classify from
   the helicopter; therefore, estimates for these 2 age classes were poor.
   Aerial surveys detected broad population trends over a number of years.}},

Title = {{Mortality patterns in a subpopulation of endangered mountain caribou}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{158-164}},
Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{Mountain caribou are an endangered ecotype of woodland caribou (Rangifer
   tarandus caribou) occurring in the high-snowfall region of southeast
   British Columbia. They occur in a series of small subpopulations, some
   of which are declining. We conducted population surveys and mortality
   monitoring for mountain caribou in the southern Purcell Mountains of
   British Columbia from 1994 to 2000. The subpopulation declined, with
   annual growth rates of 0.62 to 0.88. This was because of low calf
   recruitment (mean late winter ratio=0.05) and high adult mortality (mean
   annual rate=0.24). Reasons for low recruitment were unknown, but most
   known-cause adult mortality was from predation, particularly by cougars
   (Puma concolor), Mortality was higher for females than males (P=0.03).
   The southern portion of the study area had a greater proportion of
   forests less than or equal to 40 years, a higher road density, and was
   more fragmented than the northern portion. Caribou mortality also was
   higher in the south than the north (P=0.03). This may have been due in
   part to post-disturbance changes in the distribution of ungulates
   favoring edges and early seral forests and the predators that were
   attracted to these ungulates. If current trends continue, the southern
   Purcell caribou herd will almost certainly be extirpated within a
   decade. We recommend augmenting this subpopulation, conducting research
   into relationships between predation and patterns of forest harvesting
   and reasons for low calf recruitment, and limiting predation by reducing
   numbers of cougars and alternate prey.}},

Abstract = {{Public interest in using nonlethal methods to manage white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) has prompted a need for better information on
   mortality from capture and handling techniques. We compared mortality
   and injury rates for white-tailed deer captured with Stephenson box
   traps, Clover traps, rocket nets, and dart guns. Capture-related
   mortality rates ranged from 2.0\% to 20.7\%. We did not attribute any
   difference in mortality rates to age, reproductive condition, number of
   handlers, or number of deer captured at one time. Deer with lesser
   weights captured with Clover traps were more susceptible to capture
   mortality. To reduce effects of shock and stress on captured deer, we
   recommend post-capture monitoring to assess myopathy-related mortality,
   reducing stimulation of deer during capture and handling, monitoring
   viral signs of deer during processing, and preparing handling crews to
   administer support drugs and vitamin supplements.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife management is more than just biology, and practicing wildlife
   professionals are confronted often with the human dimensions aspect of
   the profession. However, resolution of conflicts over wildlife
   management issues requires more than sophisticated human dimensions
   techniques. Reliable knowledge is the foundation supporting wildlife
   management decisions; a lack of reliable knowledge provides a blank
   check to support lawyers. I discuss examples of situations in which
   wildlife professionals demonstrate a lack of rigor in gaining reliable
   knowledge, including refraining from opportunities to collect knowledge
   and not adequately monitoring the impacts of management decisions. also
   address the improper use of population viability analysis and the
   adaptive management paradigm. So how does calculus relate! Calculus and
   other quantitative courses train students to conceptualize problems and
   to think logically about solutions. Courses in experimental design and
   sampling provide the concepts of cause-and-effect and a valid sample of
   the population to which inferences apply. The past record of the
   wildlife profession does not speak well of our ability to demonstrate
   rigor in our management, as evidenced by the increasing rate at which
   management decisions are being made by courts and ballot initiatives. A
   capacity for rigorous thinking is derived through mental exercises, and
   a foundation of quantitative courses provides this development.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to devise a way to facilitate the use of
   fixed air monitors data in order to assess population exposure. A
   weighting scheme that uses the data from different monitoring sites and
   takes into account the time-activity patterns of the study population is
   proposed. PM2.5 personal monitoring data were obtained within the
   European EXPOLIS study, in Grenoble, France (40 adult non-smoking
   volunteers, winter 1997). Volunteers carried PM2.5 personal monitors
   during 48 h and filled in time-activity diaries. Workplaces and places
   of residence were classified into two categories using a Geographic
   Information System (GIS): some volunteers' life environments are seen as
   best represented by PM10 ambient air monitors located in urban
   background sites; others by monitors situated close to high traffic
   density sites (proximity sites). Measurements from the Grenoble fixed
   monitoring network using a TEOM PM10 sampler were available across the
   same period for these two types of sites (PM10back and PM10prox). These
   data were used to compute a translator parameter Delta (i) that forces
   the measured PM2.5 personal exposures (PM2.5persoi) to equate the
   average PM10 urban ambient air concentrations ({[}PM10back +
   PM10prox]/2) measured the same days. Average Delta (i) was 4.2 mug/m(3)
   (CI95\%{[}-3.4; 11.9]), with true average PM2.5 personal exposure being
   36.2 mug/m(3) (28.2; 44.1). PM10 ambient levels at the proximity site
   and at the background site were respectively PM10prox = 43.8 mug/m(3)
   (37.1; 50.6) and PM10back = 37.0 mug/m(3) (31.8; 42.3). In order to
   assess the consistency of this PM approach, six scenarios of `proximity'
   and `background' environments were accommodated, according to traffic
   intensity and road distance. Delta (i) was estimated for the entire
   EXPOLIS population and for subgroups, using terciles based on the
   percentage of time spent in proximity by each subject. Other similar
   studies need to be conducted in different urban settings, and with ether
   pollutants, in order to assess the generalizability of this simple
   approach to estimate population exposures from air quality surveillance
   data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   intoxication of the population by small scale gold mining}},

Abstract = {{The region of Diwalwal, dominated by Mt. Diwata, is a gold rush area on
   Mindanao (Philippines) where approximately 15 000 people live. The
   fertile plain of Monkayo is situated downstream, where people grow crops
   such as rice and bananas; locally caught fish is eaten frequently. The
   ore is dug in small-scale mines and ground to a powder by ball-mills
   while still in Diwalwal. The gold is then extracted by adding liquid
   mercury (Hg), forming gold-amalgam. To separate the gold from the Hg, in
   most cases the amalgam is simply heated in the open by blow-torches. A
   high external Hg burden of the local population must be assumed. To
   evaluate the internal Hg burden of the population and the extent of
   possible negative health effects, 323 volunteers from Mt. Diwalwal,
   Monkayo and a control group from Davao were examined by a questionnaire,
   neurological examination and neuro-psychological testing. Blood, urine
   and hair samples were taken from each participant and analyzed for total
   Hg. A statistical evaluation was possible for 102 workers
   (occupationally Hg burdened ball-millers and amalgamsmelters), 63 other
   inhabitants from Mt. Diwata ('only' exposed from the environment), 100
   persons, living downstream in Monkayo, and 42 inhabitants of Davao
   (serving as controls). The large volume of data was reduced to yes/no
   decisions. Alcohol as a possible bias factor was excluded (level of
   alcohol consumption and type, see Section 4.4). Each factor with a
   statistically significant difference of at least one exposed group to
   the control group was included in a medical score (0-21 points). In each
   of the exposed groups this score was significantly worse than in the
   control group (median control, 3; downstream, 9; Mt. Diwata,
   non-occupational exposed, 6; Hg workers, 10). In comparison to the
   surprisingly high Hg concentration in blood (median, 9.0 mug/l; max,
   31.3) and in hair (2.65 mug/g; max, 34.7) of the control group, only the
   workers show elevated levels: Hg-blood median 11.4, max 107.6; Hg-hair
   median 3.62, max 37.8. The Hg urine concentrations of the occupational
   exposed and non-exposed population on Mt.Diwata was significantly higher
   than in the control group: control median 1.7 mug/l, max 7.6;
   non-occupational burdened median 4.1, max 76.4; and workers median 11.0,
   max 294.2. The participants, living downstream on the plain of Monkayo
   show no statistically significant difference in Hg-blood, Hg-urine or
   Hg-hair in comparison with the control group. The German
   Human-Biological-Monitoring value II (HBM II) was exceeded in 19.5\%
   (control), 26.0\% (downstream), 19.4\% (Mt. Diwata, non-occupational)
   and 55.4\% (workers) of the cases, the German occupational threshold
   limit in 19.6\% of the workers. Only some of the clinical data,
   characteristic for Hg intoxication (e.g. tremor, loss of memory, bluish
   discoloration of the gingiva, etc.), correlate with Hg in blood or
   urine, but not with Hg in hair. The medical score sum correlates only
   with Hg in urine. The poor correlation between the Hg concentration in
   the biomonitors to classic clinical signs of chronic Hg intoxication may
   be explained by several factors: HE in blood, urine and hair do not
   adequately monitor the Hg burden of the target tissues, especially the
   brain. Inter-individual differences in the sensitiveness to Hg are
   extremely large.
   In this area a mixed burden of Hg species must be assumed (Hg vapor,
   inorganic Kg, methyl-Kg). Chronic Hg burden may have established damage
   months or even years before the actual determination of the Hg
   concentrations in the bio-monitors under quite different burden was
   performed (Drasch G. Mercury. In: Seller HG, Sigel A, Sigel H, editors.
   Handbook on metals in clinical and analytical chemistry. New York:
   Marcel Dekker, 1994:479-494). Therefore, `Hg intoxication', that should
   be treated, was not diagnosed by the Hg concentration in the
   bio-monitors alone, but by a balanced combination of these Hg values and
   the medical score sum. In principle, this means the higher the Hg
   concentration in the bio-monitors, the lower the number of
   characteristic adverse effects are required for a positive diagnosis. By
   this method, 0\% of the controls, 35\% downstream, 27\% from Mt. Diwata,
   non-occupational exposed and 71.6\% of the workers were classified as Hg
   intoxicated. A reduction of the external Hg burden on Mt. Diwata is
   urgently recommended. An attempt to treat the intoxicated participants
   with the chelating agent dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) is
   planned. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The monitoring and management of species depends on reliable population
   estimates, and this can be both difficult and very costly for cryptic
   large vertebrates that live in forested habitats. Recently developed
   camera trapping techniques have already been shown to be an effective
   means of making mark-recapture estimates of individually identifiable
   animals (e.g. tigers). Camera traps also provide a new method for
   surveying animal abundance. Through computer simulations, and an
   analysis of the rates of camera trap capture from 19 studies of tigers
   across the species' range, we show that the number of camera days/tiger
   photograph correlates with independent estimates of tiger density. This
   statistic does not rely on individual identity and is particularly
   useful for estimating the population density of species that are not
   individually identifiable. Finally, we used the comparison between
   observed trapping rates and the computer simulations to estimate the
   minimum effort required to determine that tigers. or other species, do
   not exist in an area, a measure that is critical for conservation
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate long-term series of demographic data are available for most
   populations of southern elephant seals. However, research on the
   elephant seals of the Falkland Islands began only recently, and
   information for an accurate forecasting of the future of this population
   is lacking. In this paper we present data on the current status of the
   population and its trend in size during the last Il years. We built an
   age-structured model of the population and analyzed the effect of
   variation in demographic parameters on population growth. Elasticity
   analysis demonstrated that variation in mortality has a more pronounced
   effect on instantaneous growth rate than an equivalent variation in
   fecundity. We examined the effects of environmental variability,
   inbreeding and catastrophes on population viability by a computer
   simulation using the VORTEX PVA programme. In the stochastic model, the
   most important factor affecting extinction risk was variability in
   mortality rates, in particular of the adult classes. We concluded that,
   although the population does not appear to be at immediate risk of
   extinction, its small size and isolation make it necessary to accurately
   monitor the population trends and to acquire additional information on
   life history and feeding strategies.}},

Abstract = {{A small scale experiment was carried out to eradicate the sweet potato
   weevil, Cylas formicarius (Fabricius) by the sterile weevil release
   method from 1994 to 1996 on the islet, Kiyamajima, 35 ha, of the Amami
   Islands, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Weevils were mass-reared with
   fresh sweet potato roots at 27 degreesC and roots filled with the
   weevils were irradiated with gamma ray, 80 Gy on the 27th to 28th days
   after oviposition (newly eclosed adult). Sterile weevils were stained
   with fluorescent dyes and released by hand on host plant foliages.
   Monitoring was done by both pheromone traps and root traps throughout
   the experimental period. From 11 January, 1994 to 19 July, 1994, ca.
   32,000 sterile weevils were released every 10 d as a rule all over the
   island. This trial suggested the necessity of a denser release of
   sterile weevils for successful eradication. Thus, for intensive release
   ca. 16,000 sterile weevils were released every 10 d as a rule from 29
   July, 1994 to 5 September, 1995 in a restricted area, 13 ha, as the
   release zone. The wild population in the release zone was controlled to
   zero or at least nearly to zero after summer in 1995. Only a few
   unmarked males were captured by pheromone traps for one year after the
   final release of sterile weevils on 5 September, 1995, which was
   probably immigrants from outside of the release zone. No weevils were
   found in the reexamination of root traps and dissection of wild host
   plants carried out in September in 1996.}},

Abstract = {{A 90-cm sediment core from Lake Esrom was analysed for subfossil diatoms
   and Chironomidae. Quantitative diatom-inferred reconstruction of total
   phosphorus showed an increase in TP levels from 84 mug P/l around 1600
   AD (extrapolated Pb-210 chronology) to 200 mug P/l in 1975, followed by
   a decrease to 165 mug P/l at the present day. Chironomid-inferred
   chlorophyll-a concentration ranged from 5-15 mug chl-a/l throughout the
   core. Analysis of historical oxygen data and long-term zoobenthic
   population dynamics from the profundal zone of Lake Esrom suggested that
   the period of oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion increased during the
   20(th) century. However, the chironomid record showed only minor
   variations in the subfossil assemblages over the last similar to 400
   years and there was no chironomid indication of significant changes in
   the hypolimnetic (oxygen) conditions. Because primary production in Lake
   Esrom is nitrogen limited during the stratification period, the
   chlorophyll concentration is lower than commonly found for Danish lakes
   with comparable phosphorus concentrations. However, both the
   diatom-{[}TP] and chironomid-{[}chl-a] inferred values for recent
   periods agree well with monitored data. The two models work because the

Abstract = {{Ospreys are good indicators of the health of estuarine areas because
   they feed almost exclusively on fish with the balance on other aquatic
   biota. Through the 1980s, ospreys nesting on Delaware Bay in New Jersey
   had reduced reproductive success relative to those nesting on the
   Atlantic coast and the Maurice River, a tributary of Delaware Bay.
   Earlier research suggested that elevated levels of DDT and
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminants identified in addled osprey
   eggs contributed to this reduced productivity. We repeated egg and prey
   sampling initially conducted in 1989 to evaluate the trends of
   contaminants in the last decade. Most organochlorine contaminants
   declined in osprey eggs in 1998 relative to 1989. Across three study
   areas, PCBs decreased from 4.1-7.7 ppm in 1989 to 1.8-3.2 ppm in 1998;
   DDE decreased from 1.2-3.2 ppm in 1989 to 0.7-1.2 ppm in 1998. Lead in
   eggs increased from an average of 0.01 to 0.30 ppm wet weight, and
   mercury averaged 0.12 ppm and increased only in Atlantic coast eggs.
   Most of these contaminant changes were also found in typical prey fish:
   PCBs decreased from 0.18-1.2 ppm in 1989 to 0.06-0.43 ppm in 1998; DDE
   decreased from 0.05-0.69 ppm in 1989 to 0.03-0.13 ppm in 1998. Lead and
   mercury increased in most fish samples. The improvement in most
   organochlorine contaminants in osprey eggs and prey reflected improved
   nest success in the Delaware Bay study area, and the nesting populations
   in the Atlantic and Maurice River study areas increased approximately
   200\% since 1989. PCBs and DDE in osprey eggs were below levels
   considered to be toxic to egg development. This study documents
   significant improvements in organochlorine contaminants in southern New
   Jersey ospreys, but justifies continued monitoring of heavy metals, such
   as lead and mercury, in aquatic ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{There is a paucity of data on the movement patterns of feral cats in
   Australia. Such data can be used to refine control strategies and
   improve track-based methods of monitoring populations of feral cats. In
   this study the home ranges and movements of male feral cats were
   examined over 3.5 years in a semiarid woodland environment in central
   Australia. Two home range estimators were used in the examination: (i)
   minimum convex polygon (MCP); and (ii) fixed kernel. The most widely
   used method of estimating home range in feral cats is MCP, while the
   fixed kernel method can be used to identify core areas within a home
   range. On the basis of the MCP method, the long-term home ranges of
   feral cats in central Australia were much larger than those recorded
   elsewhere (mean, 2210.5 ha). Twenty-four hour home ranges were much
   smaller (mean, 249.7 ha) and feral cats periodically shifted their 24 h
   ranges within the bounds of their long-term home ranges. Core area
   analysis indicated marked heterogeneity of space use by male feral cats.
   Several instances where feral cats moved large distances (up to 34 km)
   were recorded. These long distance movements may have been caused by
   nutritional stress. Using data from the literature, it is shown that
   prey availability is a primary determinant of long-term home range size
   in feral cats. The relevance of the results to the design of management
   strategies for feral cats in central Australia is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid human population growth of Turkey and associated demands on
   natural resources threaten the biodiversity of the nation's natural
   ecosystems, including forests. Though limited to about 26\% of the total
   land area of the country, maintaining healthy forests is vital to
   support sustainable development in Turkey. The purpose of this paper is
   to introduce the current status of Turkey's forests, present the
   national objectives for forest conservation and sustainable use. and
   describe the actions needed to protect forest biodiversity. While Turkey
   has numerous laws, regulations, and programmes that seek to promote
   biodiversity, implementation of these guidelines requires increased
   commitment and vigilance. Conservation programmes should be increased in
   number and effectiveness, particularly in light of increasing demand for
   forest products, Management plans for all conservation programmes
   require completion and implementation. Creating monitoring programs and
   building quantitative databases for conservation programs will be
   essential to assess future success in maintaining biodiversity.
   Conservation of natural resources requires public education and
   promoting awareness of the vital role of maintaining a healthy
   environment for sustainable development. Agroforestry endeavors can
   provide practical means of meeting both environmental protection and
   agricultural product production goals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Using radiotelemetry, we monitored dispersing juvenile Western Burrowing
   Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) within a migratory population in
   southwestern Idaho during 1994 and 1995. Owls remained within natal
   areas for an average (+/- SE) of 58 +/- 3.4 days post-hatching before
   moving permanently beyond 300 m, which was our operational cutoff for
   dispersal from the natal area. On average. owls dispersed on 27 July
   (range: 15 July to 22 August), which was approximately 4 weeks after
   fledging. After initiating dispersal, juveniles continued moving farther
   away from their natal burrows and, by 61-65 days post-hatching, they had
   moved 0.6 +/- 0.2 km. Each juvenile used 5.1 +/- 1.2 satellite burrows,
   and individual satellite burrows were used for up to 14 days. The
   average date on which we last sighted radio-tagged juveniles was 13
   August, and all but one juvenile departed the study area by early
   September. Our study illustrates the importance of satellite burrows to
   dispersing Burrowing Owls.}},

Abstract = {{In many respects, amphibian spatial dynamics resemble classical
   metapopulation models, in which subpopulations in breeding ponds blink
   in and out of existence and extinction and colonization rates are
   functions of pond spatial arrangement. This ``ponds-as-patches{''} view
   of amphibian spatial dynamics is useful in several respects. First, it
   highlights the importance of regional and landscape processes in
   determining local patterns of abundance. Second, it offers a
   straightforward, pond-based approach to monitoring and managing
   amphibian populations. For many species, however, the ponds-as-patches
   view may be an over-simplification and metapopulation structure may be
   more apparent than real. Changes in distribution may be caused by
   processes other than extinction and recolonization, and most extinctions
   probably result from deterministic factors, not stochastic processes. In
   addition, the effects of pond isolation appear to be important primarily
   in disturbed environments, and in many cases these isolation effects may
   be better explained by the distribution of terrestrial habitats than by
   the distribution of breeding ponds. These complications have important
   implications for both researchers and managers. For researchers, future
   efforts need to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of
   abundance and distributional change and patterns in amphibian
   populations. For managers, effective conservation strategies must
   successfully balance metapopulation considerations with careful
   attention to local habitat quality. Furthermore, translocations and
   active management may be indispensable tools for conserving amphibians
   in landscapes containing multiple breeding ponds.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the reproductive ecology of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus)
   for 3 years in a primarily forested landscape in northern Wisconsin. We
   searched for and monitored nests in large, closed-canopy northern
   hardwood forests adjacent to recent clearcuts (<6 years old) and
   measured the effect of proximity to edge on nest success, clutch size,
   and breeding pair density. Mayfield nest success was lower near the
   forest edge (0.44, N-nests = 42; <300 m) than in the forest interior
   (0.69, N-nests = 47; >300 m; chi (2) = 4.43, df = 1, p less than or
   equal to 004), and mean clutch sire was higher (4.93) near the forest
   edge than in the forest interior (4.27; t = -3.83, df = 59, p less than
   or equal to 0.0003). Edge effects on nest success and clutch size
   extended farther (300 m) into intact forest than has been documented
   previously. Using habitat-specific demographic parameters, we found that
   annual productivity per pair was similar in edge (3.37 fledglings) and
   interior (3.85 fledglings) habitat We used our estimates of per capita
   annual productivity and published estimates of adult and juvenile
   survival to approximate the finite rate of growth (lambda) for birds
   breeding in edge and interior locations. Based on published estimates of
   age-specific survival, both edge and interior habitats appear to be
   source habitats (where lambda > 1) for Ovenbirds in the landscape we
   studied. Our assessment of population status however, was extremely
   sensitive to variation in survival estimates. We used geographic
   information system data from the Nicolet National Forest to estimate
   population size in northern and mixed-hardwood forests in this region
   and to quantify annual productivity in this landscape. Ovenbirds near
   forest edges faced higher predation pressure but laid more eggs on
   average than birds in the forest interior. Our data suggest that
   Ovenbirds may make tradeoffs between the probability of nest success and
   the per-nest productivity as measured by clutch size. Our findings are
   consistent with the equilibrium state of the ideal free distribution
   model in that although individual demographic characteristics (nest
   success and clutch size) varied with distance from edge an important
   correlate of fitness, finite rate of increase (lambda) remained
   relatively, similar.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic integrity of many salmonid fish populations is threatened by
   stocking of domesticated conspecifics. The purpose of this study was to
   assess the utility of microsatellite DNA markers for detecting loss of
   genetic diversity in hatchery strains, for estimating their genetic
   relationships, and for monitoring the genetic impact of stocking
   activity on wild populations of salmonid fishes. Brown trout from ten
   hatchery strains, one supportive breeding ``strain,{''} and five wild
   populations were screened for variation at eight loci. In most hatchery
   strains, genetic variation was comparable to that of wild populations,
   but three strains showed loss of allelic variation. In six of the
   hatchery strains, significant differentiation was observed between age
   classes. Genetic differentiation among all populations was moderate
   (F(ST) = 0.065, p(ST) = 0.076), and only a minor part of genetic
   diversity was distributed between the wild and hatchery populations. We
   assessed whether wild populations were introgressed by stocked hatchery
   trout by performing assignment tests to determine population of origin
   and estimating maximum potential introgression rates. The results
   suggested that genetic introgression by hatchery trout had occurred for
   only two of the five populations potentially influenced by stocking. In
   one of these two rivers, microsatellite data obtained from a limited
   number of old scale samples indicated that individuals from the original
   population were genetically divergent from these of the present
   population, suggesting that extinction of the original population had
   taken place. The study demonstrates that microsatellite analysis
   provides a useful tool for distinguishing heavily introgressed
   populations from those unaffected by stocking. The information can be
   used to assist in (1) prioritizing populations for conservation and (2)
   the choice of wild populations to be used as sources for the
   reintroduction of salmonids in areas where local, indigenous gene pools
   have been extirpated.}},

Abstract = {{1. Two basic tenets of competition among parasitoids, that taxonomically
   distinct parasitoids are unable to discriminate against hosts that have
   previously been attacked by a competitor and that previous parasitism
   reduces the quality of a host, were tested by monitoring the oviposition
   response of Hyssopus pallidus, a gregarious ectoparasitoid, to healthy
   codling moth larvae and codling moth larvae that had previously been
   parasitised by a solitary endoparasitoid, Ascogaster quadridentata.
   2, Hyssopus pallidus accepted both categories of host larva for
   oviposition when its competitor was constrained as a first-instar larva
   by the diapause development of its host, but discriminated against
   previously parasitised host larvae when its competitor was present as a
   larger larva in a non-diapausing host.
   3. Hyssopus pallidus distinguished between the two categories of host
   larva by allocating twice as many eggs to host larvae previously
   parasitised by A. quadridentata, a response that was not influenced by
   previous oviposition experience.
   4. The larger clutch sizes allocated to previously parasitised host
   larvae produced twice as many female progeny, each of a typical size,
   such that the total biomass was twice that produced from the smaller
   clutches laid on healthy host larvae. Possible confounding influences of
   host age and diapause are discounted.
   5. These results demonstrate that interspecific discrimination does
   occur in H. pallidus and that host quality can be improved through
   previous parasitism by an endoparasitoid. Although interspecific
   discrimination appears rare among insect parasitoids, it may have been
   overlooked among ectoparasitoids and requires examination of the fitness
   consequences of interspecific interactions to clarify its adaptive
   significance.}},

Abstract = {{We present a temporally and spatially explicit mechanistic model of tree
   seed dispersal by wind, incorporating full stochasticity based on
   natural variation. The model simulates the dispersal of each individual
   seed by integrating the temporal effects of climatic conditions on the
   rate of seed release, and the spatial effects of wind direction and
   horizontal and vertical velocities, the terminal velocity of seeds
   (i.e., the constant descent velocity in calm air), and the height of
   seed release, partitioned into tree height and the distribution of seeds
   with tree height. The model was tested for two Pinus halepensis stands
   within the Mediterranean region of Israel, in which seed dispersal has
   been extensively monitored by seed traps. The predicted dispersal curve
   verified expectations of a positively skewed leptokurtic distribution
   and of peak location at some distance from a point source and at zero
   distance from an area source. Long-distance dispersal events occurred
   with very low frequency, but given the large seed crop in P. halepensis,
   even a small fraction should result in a considerable number of seeds
   dispersed far from their source. The model reliably simulates the
   observed dispersal pattern in a spatial resolution of 1 m(2) (R(2)
   between 60\% and 90\%), as revealed from comparisons of the predicted
   and observed proportions of seed dispersed to seed traps. A sensitivity
   analysis using Latin hypercube sampling along with stepwise multiple
   rank regression showed that the effects of the horizontal and vertical
   wind velocities on the dispersal distance override those of the biotic
   factors. This suggests that the synchronization of seed release with
   favorable winds is the most effective plant-controlled mechanism to
   increase the distance of dispersal in wind-dispersed species such as P.
   halepensis.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-yr study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ethephon
   (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid) on efficacy of pheromone traps in
   monitoring fall and spring populations of adult bell weevils. The
   experimental procedure consisted of a grandlure pheromone strip placed
   in a bell weevil trap together with a 7.5-ml aqueous solution of
   ethephon at 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ppm concentrations. Treatments also
   included traps with nothing, ethephon alone at each of the four
   concentrations, and grandlure alone. Traps were monitored twice a week,
   and ethephon solutions were replenished during each trap, inspection.
   Trap catch was significantly affected by year, season, and treatments.
   Overall, significantly higher numbers of boil weevils were captured in
   1996-1997 compared with 1997-1998. Average numbers of boil weevils
   captured in fall season were approximately six times higher than the
   numbers captured in the spring season. Ethephon alone did not elicit a
   significant attraction to fall or spring populations at any
   concentration evaluated. However, the combination of ethephon and
   grandlure pheromone show ed a distinct synergistic effect, enhancing the
   efficacy of pheromone-baited traps in monitoring fail migration of boil
   weevil populations. Ethephon at 1 and 10 ppm combined with grandlure
   were most attractive to fall-migrating weevils, capturing 20-35\% more
   weevils than the grandlure alone. The combination of ethephon at 10 ppm
   and grandlure also had a significant effect on weevil attractancy for
   spring populations, but the results were not consistent between years.
   Data from this study clearly suggest that the addition of ethephon to
   grandlure carl significantly improve trap attractancy and will aid in
   boll weevil monitoring and eradication strategies that aim at attacking
   the weevils during the fall, with some potential of improved attractancy
   in monitoring spring populations.}},

Abstract = {{The eastern chern fruit fly, Rhagoletis cingulata (Loew), and black
   cherry fruit ny, R. fausta (Osten Sacken), are the most important insect
   pests of cherries Prunus spp. in the eastern and midwestern United
   States. In 1998, we studied the responses of cherry fruit fly species
   using the recommended V-shaped Pherocon AM board. Significantly more R.
   cingulata flies were caught on boards with aqueous solutions of ammonium
   baits compared with boards that had solid ammonium baits mixed into the
   Tangle-Trap. Captures of R. fausta flies were low in 1998 and the weekly
   trapping data never exceeded a total of ave adults. In 1999, several
   commercial traps were evaluated including the unbaited,
   three-dimensional Rebell trap and different types of ammonium baited
   spheres and boards including a B-cm-diameter red sphere, a modified
   version of the Ladd trap (L \& S trap), and the Pherocon AM yellow board
   in the vertical and V-shaped orientations. There were significantly more
   R. fausta flies caught on unbaited Rebell traps compared with any other
   commercial traps studied. Red sphere treatments (regardless of baiting
   system) consistently captured significantly fewer R. fausta flies than
   any other treatment evaluated. For R cingulata, total captures on
   unbaited Rebell traps were not significantly different from other
   commercial traps including the 9-cm-diameter red spheres baited with
   ammonium acetate mixed into the Tangle-Trap, L \& S traps, and the
   baited Pherocon AM yellow boards deployed in a vertical orientation. The
   study demonstrated that the unbaited Rebell trap was the most effective
   and selective device evaluated for monitoring R. fausta and R. cingulata
   flies. In addition, red sphere (S-cm-diameter) traps were found
   ineffective for use in R. fausta monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on the evaluation of existing ecological monitoring
   variables from a variety of sources to select a suite of core variables
   suitable for monitoring at the Ecological Monitoring and Assessment
   Network (EMAN) sites located across Canada. The purpose of EMAN is to
   promote the acquisition of relevant and consistent data that can be used
   to report on national trends and provide an early warning of ecosystem
   change. Existing monitoring variables were evaluated in two steps. In
   the first step, three primary criteria were used to pre-screen
   preliminary variables. In the second step, a more detailed evaluation
   considered twenty criteria based on data quality, applicability, data
   collection methods, data analysis and interpretation, existing data and
   programs, and cost effectiveness to select a draft set of core
   monitoring variables (CMV). An ecological framework was developed to
   organize the CMV in a manner that permitted a gap analysis to confirm
   the CMV assessed a wide range of relevant environment components. The
   suite of CMV were then tested to determine their effectiveness in
   detecting ecosystem change caused by stressors with ecosystem responses
   that have been well documented in the literature. This project is part
   of a process lead by Environment Canada to select CMV to detect and
   track ecosystem change at EMAN sites. It is anticipated that the
   proposed CMV will undergo future discussion and development leading to
   the final selection of a suite of CMV for use at EMAN sites.}},

Abstract = {{An outdoor freshwater microcosm study was conducted in which pyridaben,
   an insecticide-miticide, was directly applied to water to determine its
   biological effects on phytoplankton and periphyton. Twenty-four
   microcosms (24 m(3) each) were monitored for 11 months, then four
   treatments of pyridaben were applied two times at three concentrations
   (0.34, 3.4, 34.0 mug/L), including an untreated control. The succession
   of algal groups observed and the major genera found in microcosms during
   the baseline phase of the study were typical of oligo-mesotrophic
   systems in Florida. Following application of pyridaben, the most
   remarkable effect was a positive correlation of phytoplankton abundance
   with pyridaben concentrations in water; indicating increased abundance
   as a result of exposure. Both Chlorophyta and Pyrrophyta exhibited a
   significant increase (p=0.05) in population abundance at 3.4 and 34.0
   mug/L pyridaben. Chrysophyta also elicited a trend of increased
   abundance at 34.0 mug/L, although the effect was not significant. The
   effects on phytoplankton populations were associated with the decline of
   zooplankton populations as a result of a direct effect of pyridaben
   exposure. There were no effects of pyridaben on periphyton communities
   or on functional endpoints. (C) 2001 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Gonadal intersex and high prevalences of the female phenotype have been
   observed in fish populations in urbanized areas. Environmental estrogens
   discharged in sewage treatment plant effluents may be responsible for
   feminization of fish but many compounds with the potential to induce
   these responses occur in effluents, including natural and synthetic
   estrogen hormones, degradation products of alkylphenol ethoxylate
   surfactants, and plasticizers. In this study, the estrogen hormones 17
   alpha -ethinylestradiol, 17 beta -estradiol, estrone, and estriol
   induced intersex (i.e., testis-ova) and altered sex in Japanese medaka
   (Oryzias latipes) when these fish were exposed to nanogram per liter
   concentrations of test compounds from hatch to approximately 100 d after
   hatch. A mix of nonylphenol mono- and diethoxylate induced a weak
   response and a mix of nonylphenol mono- and diethoxycarboxylate did not
   give a response in this assay at microgram per liter concentrations,
   indicating that these degradation products of nonylphenol ethoxylates
   have little or no estrogenic activity in fish. Bisphenol A induced
   testis-ova in medaka exposed to a concentration of 10 mug/L, but
   diethylhexyl phthalate did not induce a response. Results with the
   medaka assay were consistent with estrogenic responses in the yeast
   estrogen screening assay. Analyses of monitoring data reported in the
   literature indicate that concentrations of estrogen hormones detected in
   the final effluents of sewage treatment plants are generally greater
   than the lowest-observed effect levels for alterations to gonadal
   development in medaka.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Virginia's river fisheries for American shad have been under moratorium
   since 1994. The moratorium is partial since the three stocks (in the
   James, York, and Rappahannock rivers) are harvested to an unknown degree
   in an offshore mixed-stock fishery. Current research efforts have three
   objectives: (1) to determine current status of the stocks relative to
   historical levels, (2) to determine appropriate target catch-rate levels
   for restoration, and (3) to develop new assessment tools so that a
   future moratorium can be avoided. Current status is being evaluated by
   monitoring catch rate of commercial fishers who are paid to fish with
   historical methods in historical locations; the contemporary catch rates
   are compared to those recorded in logbooks completed voluntarily by
   fishers prior to the closure. We propose to define restoration targets
   in terms of historic catch rates recorded in logbooks. This requires
   determination of relative catching power of historic (multifilament) and
   modern (monofilament) nets. Two novel assessment methods are being
   evaluated: index-removal and change-in-ratio methods. These are based on
   comparing the catch rate and catch composition, respectively, of
   ripening fish and spent fish near the mouth of the river. During a
   moratorium, the parameters should be the same for ripening and spent
   fish, thus providing a critical check on the model assumptions. Maturity
   information is needed to forecast recruitment but previous estimates of
   maturity-at-age schedules are biased. Improved estimates can be obtained
   using anew statistical method which requires that there be a moratorium.
   It is unfortunate for society when a fish population declines to the
   point where a moratorium must be declared but a moratorium can provide
   important opportunities for testing methods and estimating parameters.}},

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a model of an individual factory trawler conducting
   fishing operations off the west coast of North America in the Pacific
   hake (Merluccius productus) fishery. The model is used to explore
   several concepts that provide new insight into fishing behavior. A
   central theme of the model is the role of decision-making at different
   spatio-temporal scales. Decision-making occurs at two scales: (1)
   choosing an area to fish, and (2) scheduling haul setting and retrievals
   whilst fishing within an area, These decisions are considered to be
   state-dependent. with state consisting of both the internal stare of the
   vessel, represented by the amount of fish in holding bins and the amount
   of fish already in the net, and the external state of the environment.
   represented by the density of Pacific hake in the area. A novel aspect
   of the model is a quantitative procedure, based on the Kalman filter,
   for modeling expert knowledge about local fish densities gained by
   searching and fishing. Information about local fish density is processed
   by the fisherman and retained in memory as a symbolic representation, or
   a ``map{''}. Although the spatial structure of the map and the updating
   procedures are quite simple in the model presented in this paper, the
   concept is general and can be extended to other kinds of information
   available to the fisherman about local fish densities. The model is used
   to characterize the optimal decision rules and to evaluate the
   usefulness of indices derived from factory trawler catch data to monitor
   population abundance trends.}},

Title = {{Living where the food is: web location by linyphiid spiders in relation

Abstract = {{1. Spiders form a major component of the generalist predator fauna,
   potentially able to restrict pest population growth, but their
   populations may be food-limited under current farming regimes. This
   study aimed to quantify food availability to spiders in winter wheat and
   to determine whether spider web locations are positively associated with
   available food resources.
   2. Mini-sticky traps (availability rate per 24 h, including prey falling
   from the crop) and mini-quadrats (instantaneous density on the ground by
   day) were used, in combination, to monitor the availability of potential
   prey to web-building species of money spider (Linyphiidae) in fields of
   winter wheat in Warwickshire, UK, 1997-98.
   3. These methods were applied to web sites of individual spiders and to
   non-web sites located randomly up to 30 cm away from each web. A total
   of 18 546 invertebrates were captured using these methods.
   4. Overall, significantly more potential prey were available in web
   sites than in non-web sites (both on sticky traps and in quadrats).
   5. Prey availability in May and July was about a third of that in June
   (both on sticky traps and in quadrats) and may have been below that
   known to be necessary for spiders to realize their maximum population
   growth rate.
   6. The peak rate of capture of linyphiid spiders on mini-sticky traps
   was 0.6 trap(-1) day(-1) at web sites, and approximately half this value
   at non-web sites. Numbers of spiders captured by mini-sticky traps and
   mini-quadrats increased exponentially as the season progressed. The high
   capture frequency in relation to population density, and the
   differential between web and non-web sites, points to a dynamic and
   aggregated distribution of spiders in winter wheat, which is consistent
   with what is known about mate-searching and web site abandonment rates
   by the Linyphiidae.
   7. The combination of techniques described here is recommended for
   monitoring prey availability in prey-enhancement programmes and may
   prove useful in quantitative studies of both intra- and interspecific
   interactions between spiders.}},

Title = {{Aggregation and temporal stability of carabid beetle distributions in
   field and hedgerow habitats}},

Abstract = {{1. Understanding the spatial dynamics of insect distributions in
   farmland can provide insights into their ecological requirements and
   potential for management. Identifying the scale, location and
   persistence of species' aggregations is an important step towards
   understanding the factors driving population distributions. This study
   examined how different carabid species were distributed in field and
   field margin habitats, and analysed their spatiotemporal dynamics.
   2. We sampled 156 locations in a grid of pitfall traps over
   approximately 1 ha, comprising a hedgerow and adjacent parts of two
   arable fields. Traps were monitored between June and November 1994 to
   provide data with high spatial and temporal resolution of the
   two-dimensional distributions of six carabid beetle taxa.
   3. The pattern of carabid activity-density over the experimental site
   was displayed in a series of contour plots. Spatial analyses by distance
   indices (SADIE) were used to provide aggregation indices (I-a) for the
   distributions of carabid species at different times.
   4. A second SADIE index (I-m) of spatial association between two sets of
   counts was used to measure the spatial stability of species' aggregation
   patterns through time. I-m was also used to measure association or
   dissociation between the distributions of different species, and the
   spatial association between a species' distribution and an environmental
   variable.
   5. Each taxon was aggregated most of the time, but different taxa
   aggregated in patches within the field and/or hedgerow to different and
   varying extents. The field boundaries were important for some species,
   either as the only habitat in which they occurred (Amara spp.), as the
   major focus of more widespread distribution (Harpalus rufipes), or as a
   seasonal refuge (Nebria brevicollis). Within the crop habitat, different
   species also occupied different areas, providing some evidence to
   suggest species packing in space.
   6. Spatial distributions between consecutive samples were strongly and
   positively associated, indicating stability of patch location over short
   time-scales. The strength of the association in turn was correlated with
   activity-density. When time lags were introduced between sample
   distributions, some negative association indices indicated displacement
   of patches. In most cases, however, positive association was maintained
   over long periods, demonstrating patch stability.
   7. The spatial stability of patches suggests that future studies should
   focus on the detailed measurement of biotic and abiotic factors
   associated with patch location. Identifying the underlying causes of
   population distributions in farmland has important implications for
   managing habitat to enhance populations of beneficial predators, and
   targeting insecticide applications in precision agriculture to minimize
   their adverse side-effects.}},

Abstract = {{1. Information on the abundance of European pinnipeds is required to
   assess interactions with fisheries and to meet new conservation
   obligations under the European Community (EC) Habitats Directive. A
   detailed time-series of data has documented increases in grey seal
   populations, but there remains considerable uncertainty over the current
   status of UK harbour seal populations.
   2. We present data on changes in the abundance of harbour seals in a
   study area within Orkney, Scotland, UK, previously considered a
   stronghold for this species. In 1998, intensive shore-based counts of
   both adults and pups were only 16-36\% of similar counts made between
   1984 and 1987. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the proportion of
   yearlings present in haul-out groups indicated a reduction in local
   recruitment.
   3. Current monitoring of UK harbour seals, using wider-scale aerial
   survey techniques, has provided important estimates of site distribution
   and relative abundance at regional and national scales. However, these
   larger-scale surveys lack associated data on within-year variation in
   counts at particular sites. Consequently, they cannot currently be used
   to explore the spatial scale of the changes in seal numbers that we
   report here. Similarly, current data from wider-scale monitoring cannot
   be used to determine whether observed local changes in abundance result
   from redistribution or a change in survival or reproduction.
   4. Management and monitoring plans are currently being developed for
   special areas of conservation (SAC) for harbour seals in response to the
   EC Habitats Directive. We suggest that more intensive research is
   required to assess whether or not similar changes in the abundance and
   age structure of seals have occurred in these areas. Without a better
   understanding of the current status of harbour seals both within and
   outside proposed SAC, future efforts to monitor the effectiveness of
   management initiatives will be constrained.}},

Title = {{A spatial model for the successful biological control of Sitona
   discoideus by Microctonus aethiopoides}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Here we describe a new model for the biological control of the pest
   weevil Sitona discoideus by the parasitoid Microctonus aethiopoides.
   Based on an earlier empirical model, the new model was expanded to
   include explicit dispersal in a coupled map lattice metapopulation.
   Model results were consistent with observed data from New Zealand,
   mimicking successful biological control with a reduction in host density
   from 1984 to 1991 and a sustained suppression of around 75\% thereafter.
   2. The metapopulation model was locally stable because of strong host
   density-dependence and a non-random parasitoid attack function.
   Metapopulation structure had little effect on the local dynamics, except
   in transient behaviour such as initial rates of parasitoid spread or the
   response to a local perturbation. The survival rate of dispersing
   weevils was nevertheless important in determining overall weevil
   abundance.
   3. Assuming that the observed low survival rate of weevils during
   dispersal (around 0.3\%) was related to the relative scarcity of its
   host-plant in the landscape, the model suggested that local weevil
   density could substantially increase with an increase in area of crop
   planted. Although the extent of biological control would be sustained in
   relative terms, increasing the crop abundance could allow a substantial
   increase in absolute pest density.
   4. With appropriate adjustment, the model also simulated the
   unsuccessful biological control observed in Australia. Advancing weevil
   oviposition in autumn (reflecting warmer autumn temperatures in
   Australia) and reducing parasitism rates among aestivating weevils
   (reflecting a lack of summer development of parasitoids in Australia,
   compared with the atypical development of a proportion in New Zealand),
   led to an inability of the parasitoid to significantly reduce weevil
   populations in the model.
   5. This host-parasitoid system is unique for the quality and duration of
   monitoring conducted before, during and after parasitoid introduction.
   It also represents one of the few biological control case studies to be
   thoroughly evaluated through use of empirical models such as the spatial
   and non-spatial versions presented here.}},

Abstract = {{1. A key element of African elephant conservation is monitoring how
   different forms of human activity influence elephant distribution and
   abundance. Information on human-elephant interaction is critical for
   guiding conservation action at all levels, from very local management
   interventions, through national protected area planning, to
   international policy initiatives such as the ban on ivory trade.
   However, methods for monitoring elephant numbers often produce rather
   poor estimate precision. Therefore, a major challenge for elephant
   monitoring programmes at all levels is to allocate survey effort
   efficiently: the greatest possible statistical power to detect the
   effects of particular forms of human activity must be obtained from
   limited survey effort.
   2. This study examined an approach to survey design based on the
   assumption that the precision of an abundance estimate is directly
   proportional to sampling effort. Field data from three sites in Central
   Africa were used to evaluate the potential of this approach for
   projecting how much effort will be necessary to survey and monitor
   forest elephants.
   3. Variance in elephant dung pile encounter rate was proportional to
   sampling effort, but variance was also influenced by mean encounter
   rate. The relationship between variance and mean encounter rate followed
   a power law more closely than the linear model suggested by many
   previous authors. The linear model tended to substantially underestimate
   the effort level required for areas with high encounter rates. A
   bootstrapping exercise suggested that modelling the precision-effort
   relationship across strata should produce more accurate projections than
   estimating a distinct precision-effort relationship for each stratum.
   4. Our results suggest that the survey design framework examined could
   substantially improve the statistical power of forest elephant
   monitoring programmes, although the use of a power law (rather than
   linear) model seems preferable. A similar approach should be appropriate
   for designing savanna elephant monitoring programmes and for addressing
   other issues, including rates of hunting and human elephant conflict.
   Furthermore, the parameter estimates reported in this study should be
   useful in designing elephant survey and monitoring programmes at other
   forested sites in Central Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality and rainfall conditions were analysed from November 1996
   to September 1997 in selected sampling sites in the Bellanwila-Attidiya
   wetlands of Sri Lanka, an area where the epizootic ulcerative syndrome
   (EUS) has occurred, in order to examine the environmental factors that
   may be associated with EUS. Quantitative sampling of fish populations
   was carried out over the study period and the recurrence of EUS was
   monitored by gross clinical signs and histopathology. The occurrence of
   EUS from the sampling sites was recorded from January 1997 to March
   1997. The outbreak was preceded by heavy rainfall. Diurnal variations in
   air temperature were relatively high during the outbreak period.
   Declining dissolved oxygen concentrations in water coincided with
   initiation of the disease outbreak. There were significantly low levels
   of dissolved oxygen in the water and significantly low rainfall in the
   area during the period of EUS in comparison with non-EUS periods. The
   biochemical oxygen demand of the water was significantly higher during
   the outbreak period than that in the period prior to the outbreak. Of
   the fish species sampled, the prevalence of EUS was highest in
   Trichogaster pectoralis (snake skin gourami). Histopathological studies
   on ulcerative lesions of fish confirmed that diffuse praliferative
   mycotic granulomatosis is a consistent feature of EUS. The results
   indicate that interaction between rainfall, deteriorating water quality
   and presence of pathogens could provide stressful conditions for fish,
   thereby inducing EUS lesions in susceptible fish populations.}},

   lure, followed by peanut butter, and distiller's grain. Other lures,
   including Trapper tablet; Victor pheromone, a crude fecal extract that
   ostensibly contains B. germanica aggregation pheromone; and Victor food
   lure elicited upwind orientation from <50\% of the test insects. Peanut
   butter and distiller's grain were equally attractive in trapping
   experiments in swine production barns and they captured significantly
   more cockroaches than the GP-2 tablet of the Victor pheromone lure; the
   commercial lures failed to attract significantly more cockroaches than
   the unbaited control traps. When tested against blank controls,
   cockroaches preferred to rest in shelters that contained the aggregation
   pheromone-based lure (Victor), but this lure as the least attractive to
   cockroaches in olfactometer assays. These results do not support claims
   that commercial crude fecal extracts attract cockroaches to traps, and

Abstract = {{Toxicological responses to azinphosmethyl of male Oriental fruit moth,
   Grapholita molesta (Busck), from five commercial orchards in which
   control failures had occurred were examined for azinphosmethyl
   resistance and for potential resistance mechanisms by using topical
   pheromone trap bioassay and compared with a reference population that
   had no history of control failure and had received little selection
   pressure. The 1998 field survey indicated moderate level of resistance
   to azinphosmethyl (2.7-4.1-fold); slopes of regressions lines
   (2.47-2.76) indicate genetically heterogeneous populations. An
   approximate twofold decline was observed between the fourth flight of
   1998 and the first flight of 1999, suggesting the presence of unstable
   resistance in moths collected from these study sites. The 1999 field
   surveys indicated lower levels of tolerance to azinphosmethyl. The
   resistance ratios ranged from 1.17 to 1.86 during the first flight of
   1999 and 1.24-2.64 during the fourth flight of 1999. Steep slopes of the
   concentration-response lines during 1999 season indicated the presence
   of genetically homogeneous populations with some exceptions. A
   1.5-2.0-fold increase was observed between the first and fourth flights
   of 1999, indicating that resistance can build up during the growing
   season. S,S,S,-tri-n-butyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF), but not piperonyl
   butoxide, significantly enhanced the toxicity of azinphosmethyl,
   suggesting that enhanced metabolism by esterases is involved in the
   tolerance of azinphosmethyl in moths collected from these study sties.}},

Abstract = {{A diet-incorporation larval bioassay was developed to measure the
   response of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), to the benzoylhydrazine
   insecticides tebufenozide and methoxyfenozide. The bioassay tested
   neonates and third, fourth, and fifth instars from a laboratory colony
   and neonates and fourth instars from a pooled population collected from
   five certified-organic apple orchards. Bioassays were scored after 6 and
   14 d. No differences between the laboratory and field population were
   found for either insecticide. Significant differences were found in the
   response of third and fifth instars between the 6 and 14 d bioassays,
   primarily due to a high proportion of moribund larvae in the shorter
   assay. Larval age had a significant effect in bioassays and was more
   pronounced in 6- versus 14-d tests. Fifth instars were significantly
   less susceptible to both insecticides than other stages, while responses
   of third and fourth instars were similar. The response of neonates was
   significantly different from third and fourth instars to tebufenozide
   but not with methoxyfenozide in the 14-d test. Field bioassays excluded
   the use of fifth instars and were scored after 14 d. LC(50)s estimated
   for 18 field-collected populations varied five- and ninefold for
   tebufenozide and methoxyfenozide, respectively. The responses of all but
   six field-collected populations were significantly different from the
   laboratory strain. Five of these six populations were collected from
   orchards with no history of organophosphate insecticide use. The LC50
   for methoxyfenozide of one field-collected population reared in the
   laboratory for three generations declined fourfold, but was still
   significantly different from the laboratory population. These data
   suggest that transforming current codling moth management programs in
   Washington from a reliance on organophosphate insecticides to
   benzoylhydrazines may be difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Personal exposures and microenvironment concentrations of 30 target VOCs
   were measured for 401 participants living in five European cities as a
   part of the EXPOLIS (Air Pollution Exposure Distributions within Adult
   Urban Populations in Europe) study. Measurements in Basel used an active
   charcoal (Carbotech) adsorbent as opposed to the Tenax TA used in the
   other study centres. In addition, within each centre, personal and
   microenvironment VOC sampling required different sampling pumps and,
   because of different sampling durations, different sampling flow rates.
   Thus, careful testing of the sampling and analysis procedures was
   required to ensure accuracy and comparability of collected data. Monitor
   comparison tests using Tenax TA showed a mean VOC concentration ratio of
   0.95 between the personal and microenvironment monitors. The LODs for
   the target VOCs using Tenax TA ranged from 0.7 to 5.2 mug m(-3). The
   LODs for the 14 target compounds quantifiable using Carbotech ranged
   from 0.9 to 3.2 mug m(-3). Tenax TA field blanks showed no remarkable
   contamination with the target VOCs, except benzaldehyde, a known
   artefact with this adsorbent. Thus, the diffusion barrier system used
   prevented contamination of Tenax TA samples by passive diffusion during
   non-sampling periods. Duplicate and parallel evaluations of the Tenax TA
   and Carbotech showed an average difference of <17\% in VOC
   concentrations within the sampling methods, but a systematic difference
   between the methods (Tenax TA:Carbotech concentration ratio =
   1.18-2.36). These field evaluations and quality assurance tests showed
   that interpretation and comparison of the results in any VOC monitoring
   exercise should be done on a compound by compound basis. It is also
   apparent that carefully planned and realised QA and QC (QA/QC)
   procedures are needed in multi-centre studies, where a common sampling
   method and laboratory analysis technique are not used, to strengthen and
   simplify the interpretation of observed VOC levels between participating
   centres.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of 2 species of arvicoline rodents, the prairie vole
   (Microtus ochrogaster) and meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus), were
   monitored monthly in alfalfa bluegrass, and tallgrass prairie habitats
   in east-central Illinois from 1972 through 1997. Alfalfa provides very
   high-quality preferred food and poor vegetative cover for both vole
   species, whereas bluegrass provides intermediate food and vegetative
   cover. Preferred food resources were very low, especially for M.
   ochrogaster, and vegetative cover was very dense in tallgrass prairie.
   Maximum and mean population densities of M. ochrogaster were highest in
   alfalfa, intermediate in bluegrass, and lowest in tallgrass prairie.
   Populations of M. ochrogaster displayed synchronous 3- to 4-year
   multiannual cycles in all 3 habitats. Cycles were most pronounced in
   alfalfa, less pronounced in bluegrass, and barely discernible in
   tallgrass prairie. Food availability seems more important than
   vegetative cover for the success of M. ochrogaster. Densities of M.
   pennsylvanicus generally were very low in bluegrass and alfalfa
   habitats, both of which contained an abundance of preferred food plants.
   When M. pennsylvanicus was present in abundance in these 2 habitats,
   populations displayed annual or erratic fluctuations. Densities of M.
   pennsylvanicus were much higher in tallgrass prairie than in the other 2
   habitats. Although vegetative cover seems more important than food
   availability for the success of M. pennsylvanicus, no evidence existed
   for population cycles in tallgrass prairie. We found no synchrony among
   population fluctuations of the 2 species of voles in the 3 habitats.}},

Title = {{Quantifying habitat specificity to assess the contribution of a patch to
   species richness at a landscape scale}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{121-131}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Assessing and predicting the species richness of a complex landscape
   remains a problem because there is no simple scaling function of species
   richness in a heterogeneous environment. Furthermore, the potential
   value of an area for biodiversity conservation may depend on which,
   rather than how many, species the area contains. This paper shows how we
   can objectively evaluate the contribution of an area, e.g., a habitat
   patch, to larger-scale plant species richness, e.g., a landscape
   composed of patches of several habitat types, and how we can test
   hypotheses that attempt to explain this contribution. We quantified the
   concept of habitat specificity to assess the proportion of each observed
   plant population that is concentrated within a given spatial element. A
   case study of a biodiversity-monitoring program in the Swiss Canton of
   Aargau showed that the relative contribution of the three main types of
   land use to the overall species richness differed strongly between
   higher taxa (vascular plants and molluscs). However, the type of data,
   i.e., presence-absence or abundance, was not important. Resampling of
   the plant data suggested that stratification provided an unbiased
   estimate of relative specificity, whereas unstratified sampling caused
   bias even for large samples. In a second case study of vascular plants
   in an agricultural landscape in central Switzerland, we tested whether
   the type, size or shape of a landscape element can predict its
   contribution to the species richness of the landscape. Habitat types
   that were less frequently disturbed contributed more per m(2) to
   landscape species richness than more frequently disturbed ones. Contrary
   to expectation, patch size was negatively correlated to specificity per
   m(2) for arable fields, whereas patch shape appeared to be unrelated to
   the specificity per m(2) both for arable fields and for meadows. The
   specificity approach provides a solution to the problem of scaling
   species richness and is ideally suited for testing hypotheses on the
   effect of landscape structure on landscape species richness. Specificity
   scores can easily be combined with measures of other aspects of rarity
   to assess the contribution of a spatial element to conservation goals
   formulated at regional, national or global level.}},

Abstract = {{In the United Kingdom,the use of TBT-based anti-fouling paints on small
   vessels was banned in 1987, and a biological study of the Crouch
   Estuary, a yachting centre on the south-eastern English coastline, was
   initiated in order to monitor any associated changes. The macrobenthic
   infauna and epifauna were sampled between 1987 and 1992, and again in
   1997, Epifaunal sampling in 1997 showed that an earlier increase in
   sedentary taxa had been sustained, and also that a large population of
   the native oyster Ostrea edulis had become established upstream.
   Multivariate analysis revealed continuance of a trend towards
   directional change in community composition at inner estuary stations,
   where TBT concentrations were historically much higher, These
   observations, along with evidence of established populations of a range
   of ascidian species in the inner estuary after an initial marked
   increase in densities, provide circumstantial evidence of an underlying
   improvement in environmental conditions following the TBT ban in 1987,

Abstract = {{Increased nitrogen loading has been implicated in eutrophication
   occurrences worldwide. Much of this loading is attributable to the
   growing human population along the world's coastlines. A significant
   component of this nitrogen input is from sewage effluent, and
   delineation of the distribution and biological impact of sewage-derived
   nitrogen is becoming increasingly important. Here, we show a technique
   that identifies the source, extent and fate of biologically available
   sewage nitrogen in coastal marine ecosystem. This method is based on the
   uptake of sewage nitrogen by marine plants and subsequent analysis of
   the sewage signature (elevated delta N-15) in plant tissues. Spatial
   analysis is used to create maps of delta N-15 and establish coefficient
   of variation estimates of the mapped values. We show elevated delta N-15
   levels in marine plants near sewage outfalls in Moreton Bay, Australia,
   a semi-enclosed bay receiving multiple sewage inputs. These maps of
   sewage nitrogen distribution are being used to direct nutrient reduction
   strategies in the region and will assist in monitoring the effectiveness
   of environmental protection measures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Molecular markers have proved extremely useful in resolving mating
   patterns within individual populations of a number of species, but
   little is known about how genetic mating systems might vary
   geographically within a species. Here we use microsatellite markers to
   compare patterns of sneaked fertilization and mating success in two
   populations of sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus) that differ
   dramatically with respect to nest-site density and the documented nature
   and intensity of sexual selection. At the Tvarminne site in the Baltic
   Sea, the microsatellite genotypes of 17 nest-tending males and mean
   samples of more than 50 progeny per nest indicated that approximately
   35\% of the nests contained eggs that had been fertilized by sneaker
   males. Successful nest holders mated with an average of 3.0 females, and
   the distribution of mate numbers for these males did not differ
   significantly from the Poisson expectation. These genetically deduced
   mating-system parameters in the Tvarminne population are remarkably
   similar to those in sand gobies at a distant site adjoining the North
   Sea. Thus, pronounced differences in the ecological setting and sexual
   selection regimes in these two populations have not translated into
   evident differences in cuckoldry rates or other monitored patterns of
   male mating success. In this case, the ecological setting appears not to
   be predictive of alternative male mating strategies, a finding of
   relevance to sexual selection theory.}},

Abstract = {{We captured rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Colorado River
   below Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona, between 1995 and 1997 to develop
   baseline data for a modified health assessment index (mHAI) and to
   determine relationships among mHAI, parasite burden, relative condition,
   mesenteric fat index, and diet. We also examined effects of a simulated
   flood on these variables during 1996. There were no significant effects
   of the flood on variables measured in the fish. Total stomach volume
   increased during spring and summer following the flood and reflected an
   expected trend. Health of fish, based on the mHAI, remained good
   throughout the study but declined with increasing burden of the nematode
   Truttaedacnitis truttae and with trout size. Increasing relative
   condition and greater mesenteric fat levels and stomach volumes of
   macroinvertebrates were associated with reduced mHAI. Larger trout also
   ate more Cladophora glomerata than did smaller fish, and nematode burden
   was related negatively to volumes of the alga and macroinvertebrates in
   stomachs, suggesting relationships among fish age, parasite burden, and
   diet. We suggest that health assessments for the tailwater rainbow trout
   fishery at Glen Canyon Dam should include relative condition and indices
   of mesenteric fat levels, nematode burden, and diet as metrics.
   Moreover, evaluations of health should address length-specific
   categories for longterm monitoring of rainbow trout in the tailwater and
   fish populations in general.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting fish population
   dynamics. An unfavorable thermal regimen can restrict a species' ability
   to thrive in its environment. We studied the effects of an unfavorable
   thermal regimen on the feeding, condition, and growth of an unexploited
   population of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum in Pymatuning Sanctuary,
   Pennsylvania. We used gastric lavage to sample stomach contents of
   walleyes captured by electrofishing during bimonthly sampling from May
   through October, 1997-1998. We sampled available forage by shoreline
   seining and recorded water temperatures using an electronic temperature
   monitor. To determine the effects of temperature on walleye feeding,
   condition, and growth, we examined relationships among water
   temperature, forage availability, percentage of stomachs containing
   food, food consumption by number and volume, and relative weight of
   adults. Average daily temperature and daily minimum temperature were
   above the thermal optimum (22degreesC) for most of the summer in both
   years. Adult catch-per-unit-effort, percentage of stomachs containing
   food, average number of food items, and volume of food consumed were all
   lowest during summer. Average relative weight of adults was lowest
   during the warmest periods of summer, and was negatively related to
   average temperature, as was average volume of food consumed. The thermal
   regimen in Pymatuning Sanctuary negatively affected adult walleye
   feeding activity, consumption, and condition, and was thus an important
   factor in structuring this population.}},

Abstract = {{Stereo recordings of harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) and Weddell
   seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) underwater vocalizations were made near
   breeding groups using separations between two hydrophones of 159-339 m.
   Within a large herd: harp seal call numbers varied slightly between
   channels. Counts of Weddell seal calls were higher near a small herd on
   the ice than 159-180 m away, Repeat counts of harp seal calls by a
   single observer differed significantly. Source levels of Weddell seal
   calls varied and higher amplitude calls would be detected up to 2 orders
   of magnitude farther away than quieter calls. Hydrophone location
   (especially near small groups), observer variability and call source
   level differences will bias the use of monitoring underwater seal
   vocalizations to index locations, population size or underwater
   behaviours. Using hydrophone arrays and multiple observers may mitigate
   these problems.}},

Abstract = {{The surface glycocalyx of four dinoflagellate species were examined by
   fluorescent lectins. Cultures were synchronized by darkness for 82 h and
   changes in DNA content, cell density and surface sugars composition were
   monitored at 2 h intervals for 52 h in populations of four species:
   Alexandrium minutum, Gymnodinium catenatum, Prorocentrum micans and
   Gyrodinium impudicum. Lectin binding properties indicated changes in the
   glycoconjugate: composition of the cell surface during the cell cycle.
   Differences in the lectin binding pattern among species were also
   observed. No detectable alpha -D-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl residues were
   found in A. minutum and G. catenatum at the cell surface and only small
   and irregular amounts of alpha -L-fucose were detected. However, large
   amounts of Lu-mannose, alpha -glucose, (N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosamine)(2)
   and, N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosaminyl were found during the greater part of
   the cell cycle of this species. P. micans only showed positive labeling
   when ConA was used, suggesting the presence of cu-mannosyl and alpha
   -glucosyl residues. More complex sugars such alpha -L-fuc and alpha
   -galNAc were never observed or were present in low amounts. All the
   sugar residues analyzed were present in the cell surface of G. impudicum
   in significant amounts. Evidence was also obtained for internalization
   of WGA receptors in P. micans and its binding to the nuclear membrane.

Abstract = {{Groundwater in a shallow coastal aquifer in north east Scotland was
   monitored over the hydrological year October 1996-September 1997.
   Groundwater flow from inland areas sustained freshwater conditions in a
   dune-wetland complex of conservation importance. In particular, seasonal
   flooding of the coastal wetlands due to water table rise provided
   important roosting and breeding habitats for waterfowl. Hydrogeochemical
   analysis revealed that groundwater in the shallow sand aquifer was
   circum-neutral, and non-saline, despite being within 50 m of the sea and
   only 1 m above the mean high water mark. Calcium and HCO3- were the
   dominant cation and anion respectively, reflecting weathering processes
   in the aquifer. Use of the geochemical code NETPATH indicated that
   calcite weathering in shell fragments within the sand was the primary
   source of Ca and alkalinity generation. The concentrations of Na and Cl
   were also important, though these can be explained primarily by
   atmospheric inputs from precipitation. In detail, the spatial and
   temporal variation in groundwater chemistry was remarkably complex for
   what intuitively appeared a simple aquifer system. Temporal variations
   in groundwater chemistry mainly related to the seasonal event of
   groundwater recharge. Thus, the main period of rising groundwater levels
   resulted in a marked dilution of solutes in the aquifer, implying that
   water storage greatly increased in a relatively short period. A period
   of several weeks appeared to be required for dissolution processes to
   proceed to equilibrium. Spatial variation in groundwater chemistry
   appears to relate to the spatial distribution of geochemical processes
   in different hydrogeological units. Sulphate reduction, alkalinity
   generation and Fe precipitation appear to be locally important
   processes. The chemistry of groundwater maintains the wetland habitat by
   providing freshwater conditions that allow populations of various plant
   species to flourish. The potentially large recharge catchments of
   coastal wetlands, together with increasing pressures in the coastal
   zone, dictate that pollution can threaten the integrity of hydrochemical
   processes and requires careful monitoring if freshwater wetlands are to
   maintain their conservation importance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The study evaluated occupational exposure to trihalomethanes (THMs) in
   indoor swimming pools. Thirty-two subjects, representing the whole
   workforce employed in the five public indoor swimming pools in the city
   of Modena (Northern Italy) were enrolled. Both environmental and
   biological monitoring of THMs exposure were performed. Environmental
   concentrations of THMs in different areas inside the swimming pools (at
   the poolside, in the reception area and in the engine-room) were
   measured as external exposure index, while individual exposure of
   swimming pool employees was estimated by THMs concentration in alveolar
   air. The levels of THMs observed in swimming pool water ranged from 17.8
   to 70.8 mug/l; the mean levels of THMs in ambient air were 25.6 +/- 24.5
   mug/m(3) in the engine room, 26.1 +/- 24.3 mug/m(3) in the reception
   area and 58.0 +/- 22.1 mug/m(3) at the poolside. Among THMs, only
   chloroform and bromodichloromethane were always measured in ambient air,
   while dibromochloromethane was detected in ambient air rarely and
   bromoform only once. Biological monitoring results showed a THMs mean
   value of 20.9 +/- 15.6 mug/m(3). Statistically significant differences
   were observed according to the main job activity: in pool attendants,
   THMs alveolar air were approximately double those observed in employees
   working in other areas of the swimming pools (25.1 +/- 16.5 mug/m(3) vs.
   14.8 +/- 12.3 mug/m(3), P < 0.01), THMs in alveolar air samples were
   significantly correlated with THMs concentrations in ambient air (r =
   0,57, P < 0.001). Indoor swimming pool employees are exposed to THMs at
   ambient air levels higher than the general population. The different
   environmental exposure inside the swimming pool can induce a different
   internal dose in exposed workers. The correlation found between ambient
   and alveolar air samples confirms that breath analysis is a good
   biological index of occupational exposure to these substances at low
   environmental levels, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{With their species diversity, their population abundance and their
   integrator characters, higher plants represent useful tools to solve
   problems concerning the environment analysis and management. As they are
   good bioindicators, plants integrate many environmental parameters and
   can help to reveal the misworking of the ecosystems. Within this
   framework, a recent and complete survey of the phanerogamic flora of the
   Brussels area was carried out by the method of the Aoristic,grid-map
   based on 1 km - squares. A comparison with earlier data has allowed us
   to appreciate the consequences of half st century of human activities on
   plant diversity in the urban ecosystem. The basic aim is to present a
   method of diagnosis and mapping that has been used, so as to turn the
   descriptive information about the biological environment of the area
   into a series of guidelines for land-use regulation and management
   within the city.
   Ellenberg's indicator values were used to express the relationship of
   flora to soil nitrogen, moisture content, reaction, light and
   temperature. Considering the biological characteristics of new floristic
   components and plants which have become rare or disappeared, it was
   possible to draw conclusions about the alterations in environmental
   conditions in Brussels. Our results show that the number of species did
   not differ significantly from 1940 until now. However, considerable
   changes have appeared during this period: there is a clear increase in
   the number of alien species; the flora of the Brussels area is becoming
   more nitrophilous and tolerant to shade, while it does not differ with
   respect to soil moisture, reaction and temperature.
   Human activities have disturbed the distribution and abundance of many
   species, inducing a decline or disappearance of some of them,
   principally those which are associated with cropland, with marshland and
   woodland. On the other hand, numerous species have recently appeared in
   the city, many of which are aliens. The comparison between indigenous
   and alien species has revealed that their occurrence depends upon their
   ecological requirements: alien species are more tolerant of nitrogen,
   light, drought, heat and alkaline soils.
   The response of the flora to human impact is clearly demonstrated. Such
   sensitivity has obvious implications for both conservation and
   management. Circumstances, where Brussels plant monitoring is carried
   out permitting the avoidance of potential disaster and the saving of
   valuable biological resources, are developed. Arguments for the
   conservation of wild plants in cities also lead to some remarks
   concerning nature conservation practices in Brussels. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Title = {{Influence of different stocking rates on plant diversity of Artemisia

Abstract = {{The experiment was conducted in Inner Mongolia steppe located in 43
   degrees 26' - 44 degrees 08' N, 116 degrees 04' - 117 degrees 05' E in
   1989 - 1997. The grazing experiment design was 5 stocking rates (0.00,
   1.33, 2.67, 4.00, 5.33 and 6.67 sheep . hm(-2), but 0.00, 1.33, 2.00,
   2.67, 3.33 and 4.00 sheep . hm(-2) in 1990) with three 1 hm(2)
   rotational paddocks per treatment. The sheep were Inner Mongolia fine
   sheep and the experiment was performed during warm seasons every year
   from May 20 to October 5. The objectives were to research the integrated
   influence of different stocking rates on plant diversity and to provide
   knowledge of its mechanism by the method of continuous monitoring of 8
   years for the same grazing experiment rather than through spatial
   gradient. The results showed that using the method of 100 m sample line
   was suitable for estimating die abundance of plant species. Simpson
   index and evenness were Letter parameters to measure the influence of
   different stocking rates on plant diversity for Artemisia frigida
   community. The plant species abundance almost remained unchanged, but
   the plant diversity and evenness decreased as the stocking rate
   increased, and the community dominance increased with stocking rate
   during the 8 years' grazing under different stocking rates. The
   interaction of the preferred ingestion of grazing sheep with heavy
   stocking rate may be one of the key reasons resulting in the decrease of
   plant diversity and evenness. Grass proportion decreased with the
   increase of stocking rates and A. frigida community degraded further
   into Potentilla acaulis community under heavy grazing or overgrazing.
   The succession and plant diversity of A. frigia community under
   different stocking rates mainly depend on the dynamics of A. frigida,
   Cleistogenes squarrosa, Potentilla acaulis, Agropyron cristatum and
   Carex duriuscula populations; Cleistogenes squarrosa population is one
   of the 3 populations of maximum abundance under all stocking rates from
   1989 to 1997.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of suitable roosts influences the distribution and
   abundance of bats. Quantifying roosting requirements is a necessary step
   toward effectively monitoring, managing, and conserving bats. Our
   objectives were to locate and characterize the natural, daytime summer
   roosts of Myotis septentrionalis, M, thysanodes, M. volans, and
   Eptesicus fuscus in the Black Hills of South Dakota, USA and compare
   local roosts to those used in other regions. Bats were marked with radio
   transmitters and followed to roosts. We successfully tracked 37 bats of
   four species to a total of 81 roosts. Myotis septentrionalis and E.
   fuscus consistently used trees, while M. thysanodes and M. volans used
   both trees and rock crevices. Roost trees were consistently among the
   largest available and were found in areas of relatively high snag
   densities. Maintaining forests with high snag densities and large trees
   will likely benefit bat populations in the Black Hills. All species
   switched roosts, but generally remained within small (approximate to4
   km(2)) areas. Lactating M. thysanodes changed roosts together while
   carrying young. Fidelity to roosts and roost areas was demonstrated by
   bats in the Black Hills.}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses the extent of midwinter activity (June-July, 1996,
   1998) in an island population of lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina
   tuberculata) located at the southern limit (= highest latitude) of the
   species' distribution. Activity of radio-tagged bats (n = 22 bats) was
   monitored over 38 nights (years combined). A mean +/- SE of 64.1 +/-
   6.5\% (range = 0-100\%) of radio-tagged bats flew on each night
   monitored when mean minimum temperature was 3.4 +/- 0.5 degreesC.
   Temperatures ranged from -1.0 to 8.9 degreesC, and 33\% of tagged bats
   flew on the coldest night. Video-monitoring revealed high levels of
   activity at I I large communally occupied tree roosts on 100\% of nights
   monitored (n 31 nights, years combined). Mean minimum temperatures on
   these nights was 3.0 degreesC +/- 0.5 (range = -1.4-7.1). Periods of
   activity were associated with feeding, social displays and changing
   roost sites. Movements of bats were dynamic with large numbers emerging
   from and entering roosts, often simultaneously, throughout most of the
   night (x = 81.9 +/- 3.3\% of night). Maximum numbers of active bats in
   tree cavities at one time numbered > 100 individuals on 75\% of nights
   monitored. These included nine nights when individuals numbered > 500,
   and five nights when individuals numbered > 1,000 (maximum = 1,443).
   Radio-tagged bats spent 57.1 +/- 9.7\% of time monitored roosting alone
   and the remainder roosting communally. They changed roost site on
   average every 4.2 +/- 0.8 days moving between a total of 35 different
   roosts. Roosts were often re-used either by the same individual or by
   several different bats. Most radio-tagged bats visited communal night
   roosts that were different from those they had used during the day, with
   up to eight radio-tagged individuals visiting simultaneously. Lower
   levels of activity were recorded at six roosts that were occupied on the
   same nights as large active communal roosts. Video-monitoring over a
   total of 31 nights revealed external activity at these roosts on only 11
   nights (35.4\%). One radio-tagged bat did not emerge for 13 days. I
   suggest that winter activity may not be as energetically expensive for
   M. tuberculata as for many other cold-temperate bat species. Their
   ability to forage on terrestrial invertebrates, which are not commonly
   available to other species, and to select different roost sites where
   they could either remain active or relatively inactive, may allow them
   to be active more frequently and for longer durations.}},

Abstract = {{This research evaluated exposure pathways across work tasks for three
   organophosphate pesticides in a group of greenhouse workers. During
   reentry in ornamental plant greenhouses, five male workers were
   monitored far five consecutive days. Skin contamination (excluding
   hands) was evaluated with nine pads of filter paper placed on the skin.
   Hand contamination was assessed by washing with 95\% ethanol.
   Respiratory exposure was evaluated by personal air sampling. The
   respiratory dose was based on a lung ventilation of 20 L/min. The doses
   absorbed were estimated assuming 10\% skin penetration and 100\% lung
   retention. Urinary alkylphosphates were assayed in the 24-hour urine
   samples of the days on which exposure was evaluated. Respiratory
   exposure was usually less than skin contamination, being 4.5 +/- 8.4\%,
   9.9 +/- 10.0\%, and 49.5 +/- 26.6\% (mean +/- standard deviation) of
   total exposure for omethoate, tolclofos-methyl, and fenitrothion,
   respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that urinary
   alkylphosphate (nmol/24 hours) (y) was significantly correlated (r =
   0.716, p < 0.001) with the respiratory doses of the three active
   ingredients absorbed the same day (x(1)) and with the cutaneous dose
   absorbed the previous day (x(2)). The relationship was expressed by the
   equation y = 0.592x(2) + 0.117x(1) + 156.364. The doses of omethoate
   absorbed by one worker were more than 45 times the acceptable daily
   intake (ADI) of 1.41 nmol/kg body weight (b.w.) The ADI for fenitrothion
   and tolclofos-methyl (10.8 and 212.6 nmol/kg body weight, respectively)
   were never exceeded. High absorption by one worker underlines the
   importance of correct use of protective clothing. In this study the
   hands were always a source of contact with the pesticides. Greater
   precautions should be taken to reduce contamination (clean gloves,
   constant use of gloves).}},

Abstract = {{San Nicolas, located in the north of Buenos Aires province, Argentina,
   is a medium sized city with a population of 160,000 inhabitants. It is
   settled in an important industrial area and its vehicular traffic has
   steadily increased during the last years. About 50\% of the automobile
   units are more than 10 years old, and they have neither good combustion
   systems nor catalytic converters.
   Pollution levels in the center area of San Nicolas City, where the
   traffic is more intense, have been determined every hour for two years
   through a monitoring station that measures the concentrations of
   different pollutants. One meteorological station simultaneously measures
   the surface parameters. In that way it is possible to study the air
   quality situation at different meteorological conditions and in the
   different seasons during the year. The data determined during the period
   of time in which the wind directs the industrial emissions toward the
   city center are neglected, with the objective to study the vehicular
   traffic contribution only.
   Some correlations between the concentrations of different measured
   pollutants, CO, NOx, SO2, O-3, HC and PM10, have been established. The
   effects of heating systems during winter periods on pollutants
   concentrations have been identified and estimated. Important differences
   in the air quality because of traffic intensity on different week days
   and time of day originated by specific social activities have been
   determined and constitute the main part of this study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the link between traffic-related primary
   pollutants and traffic volume in Surrey. This County, in the South East
   of England, was selected for the study as it has one of the highest
   levels of population density within the United Kingdom, hence elevated
   levels of car ownership and traffic flow. In addition, there were very
   few major industrial sources within the County, thus air pollutants were
   likely to be predominantly caused by traffic. This assumption was
   confirmed by comparing diurnal patterns of pollution at one location on
   a typical weekday, and Christmas Day, when the traffic was minimal.
   A further investigation compared the diurnal patterns of pollution with
   the levels of traffic provided by the local transportation model. This
   demonstrated a direct link between the primary pollutant, nitrogen oxide
   (NO) and traffic volume. The results showed two daily peaks in pollutant
   levels, which coincided with morning and afternoon `rush hours'. Similar
   distributions were also obtained for the other primary pollutants,
   carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM10), measured at the same
   monitoring site. The study was then extended to two further locations
   within Surrey. Both of these were found to produce similar daily
   distributions of NO and PM10 although the actual magnitude of pollutants
   varied. Lower values were measured at the background site, due to its
   distance from the pollutant source.}},

Abstract = {{We measured predation on artificial ground nests ill 11 grassy fields
   ranging from 0.8-12.6 ha. We set out 12 nests in each field baited with
   two Japanese quail eggs at different distances (<10 m, 25 m, 50 m) from
   woody edges in early June, and another 12 nests baited with one quail
   and one zebra finch egg in each field in mid-July. Nests were monitored
   at 3-d intervals for 15 d. The proportion of nests in which quail eggs
   were depredated was 33\% in June and 38\% in July. Including predation
   on finch eggs raised the proportion of nests depredated to 78\% in July,
   indicating that small-mouthed nest predators such as mice or shrews
   could account for a substantial amount of predation on nests of small
   passerine birds. Predation on nests was negatively related to area of
   field only for quail eggs in July (P = 0.04). We did not detect
   significant relationships between numbers of nests depredated or daily
   predation rates and distance to wood! edges. The small size of fields in
   our study, which are typical of grassland patches in this region, ma) be
   below a threshold at which nests ill the interior of patches experience
   reduced predation. Alternatively, highly fragmented natural habitats in
   an agricultural landscape ma! support high densities of predators,
   making edge and area effects difficult to detect.}},

Abstract = {{In running water, the main natural factor of disturbance is hydraulic.
   Investigation of its biological impact is currently complicated by the
   increase of anthropogenic disturbances which tend to mask the natural
   functioning of rivers. Monitoring of the impacts of the artificial
   alterations undergone by the Middle Rhone River for some decades took
   place in the mid-1980s. Discharge and temperature could constitute the
   major events controlling the biological dynamics in terms of variations
   in species richness, diversity, and abundance. The between-years changes
   of the structure and diversity of macroinvertebrate communities were
   connected with the amplitude of discharge fluctuations. This was in
   accordance with the disturbance-diversity concept and it seems to
   confirm the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. The fish community
   mainly depended on hydroclimatic factors that influenced breeding
   success. Variations in nutrient input played a secondary role in
   controlling changes in some communities (particularly the periphyton).
   Therefore it appears that the study of long-term changes in river
   systems, including the dynamics of their biological communities,
   requires continuous observations and data collection that only medium-
   to long-term studies can provide, implying the setting up of ecological
   monitoring centres for the natural environment such as the Long Term
   Ecological Research (LTER) sites in United States.}},

Abstract = {{Natural ecological disturbance creates habitats that are used by diverse
   groups of birds. In North America, these habitats or ecosystems include
   grasslands or prairies, shrublands, savannas, early successional
   forests, and floodplains. Whereas the extent of all natural habitats has
   diminished significantly owing to outright loss from agriculture and
   development, the suppression of disturbance by agents such as fire and
   flooding has led to further losses. Accordingly, the abundances of many
   bird species adapted to disturbance-mediated habitats have declined as
   well. In North America, these declines have been more severe and common
   than those of species associated with less frequently disturbed habitats
   such as mature or closed-canopy forests. Field studies consistently
   reveal the direct role of disturbance and successional processes in
   structuring avian habitats and communities. Conservation strategies
   involving the management of disturbance through some combination of
   flooding, application of fire, or the expression of wildfire, and use of
   certain types of silviculture have the potential to diversify avian
   habitats at the local, landscape, and regional scale. Many aspects of
   the disturbance ecology of birds require further research. Important
   questions involve associations between the intensity and frequency of
   disturbance and the viability of bird populations, the scale of
   disturbance with respect to the spatial structure of populations, and
   the role of natural vs. anthropogenic disturbance. The effects of
   disturbance and ensuing successional processes on birds are potentially
   long-term, and comprehensive monitoring is essential.}},

Abstract = {{A phytoplankton monitoring project was initiated in 1988 to study the
   impact of aquaculture on the phytoplankton community; act as an early
   warning for industry of potentially harmful species; determine patterns,
   trends; and establish baseline data for phytoplankton populations.
   Although more than 150 species of phytoplankton have been observed in
   the Bay of Fundy, few have been implicated in harmful events. Prior to
   1998, those with the greatest economic impacts were blooms of
   Alexandrium fundyense and Pseudo-nitzschia pseudodelicatissima,
   organisms responsible for causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
   and amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), respectively. Industries directly
   affected include shellfish industries such as soft-shell clam and blue
   mussel where unsafe levels of toxins accumulate in tissues following
   filter feeding causing shellfish areas to be closed to harvesting. This
   is an annual summertime occurrence for PSP whereas ASP has occurred
   during the late summers of 1988 and 1995. During 1998 and 1999 the
   salmon aquaculture industry experienced losses in upper Passamaquoddy
   Bay associated with Mesodinium rubrum. During 1998, mortalities occurred
   during the last week of a 4 wk red water event where the mode of action
   suggested secondary effects such as asphyxiation due to oxygen depletion
   during bloom decay. The 1999 M. rubrum bloom only persisted for one week
   with salmon exhibiting symptoms of stress associated with low oxygen
   resulting from a combination of the red tide, decreased currents,
   elevated temperatures,and gill insult. Oceanographic processes
   controlling phytoplankton dynamics in the area suggest that upper
   Passamaquoddy Bay waters are suitable for high primary production and
   the generation of red tides.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic primary productivity is frequently limited by the availability
   of nutrients. The ability to identify factors limiting algal growth is
   of considerable importance to our understanding of the ecology of
   aquatic plants and to water management practices. Methods used to
   identify limiting resources in the past have included a) analysis of
   nutrient availability, b) elemental composition and cell quotas for
   various nutrients, c) bio-assays monitoring growth of test species or of
   natural populations following nutrient enrichment and d) measurements of
   various physiological parameters, such as enhancement of respiration and
   dark carbon fixation rates and perturbation of photosynthetic rate
   following re-supply of nutrients.
   In this paper we briefly review the merits and methodological
   limitations of these approaches for the assessment of the nutrient
   status of algal populations. We discuss how an understanding of
   biochemical and metabolic changes induced by nutrient limitation has led
   to the development of rapid and simple tools to monitor the nutrient
   status of aquatic plants and algae. In particular, we describe the use
   of transient changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence as a potential tool
   for rapid assessment of algal nutrient status and the development of
   molecular probes specific to nutrient limited cells, such as flavodoxin
   as a diagnostic tool for Fe-limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Ageri hosts three crayfish species: Austropotamobius torrentium,
   Astacus astacus and Astacus leptodactylus. To study the interspecific
   competition and a possible scenario of displacement, we monitored the
   distribution and relative densities of the different species during the
   years 19961999 by SCUBA diving. We examined the association of the
   species with different types of substrate and investigated the frequency
   of limb loss and the life history characteristics of the three species.
   A. leptodactylus was found at more sites than A. astacus and A.
   torrentium. It was also present in much higher densities than the other
   two species. A. torrentium preferred areas with hard substrate, whereas
   A. astacus was more often found at sites with soft substrate and reed
   vegetation. A. leptodactylus was observed on soft and hard substrate.
   The frequency of limb loss was highest in A. astacus and more frequent
   at sites with a high density of A. leptodactylus. Limb loss in A.
   leptodactylus and A. torrentium was more frequent at sites with high
   self-densities. Females of the two Astacus species carried more eggs
   than A. torrentium females. The eggs of A. astacus were larger than the
   eggs of the other two species. Juveniles of A. leptodactylus grew
   significantly faster in their first year than juveniles of A. astacus
   and A. torrentium. During the four years of the study A. leptodactylus
   expanded its range along the southeastern shore of Lake Ageri. At the
   northwestern border of its distribution the portion of A. leptodactylus
   had slightly increased by the end of the study period. In two areas of
   the lake the population of A. astacus and A. leptodactylus declined
   between 1997 and 1999.}},

Abstract = {{From August to October 1996, a station in the freshwater tidal reaches
   of the Schelde estuary was sampled every two days to study short-term
   changes in the phytoplankton community. The monitoring study started
   after a long period of low and constant discharge and our data suggest
   that at that time, phytoplankton productivity was bottom-up limited by
   silica and/or top-down controlled by grazers. Rainfall in the middle of
   August resulted in a flushing of almost half of the estuarine volume
   upstream of our monitoring station. This fresher ended the period of
   limitation by removing grazers as well as supplying new silica, while
   having no direct effect on total phytoplankton biomass. It was followed
   by a gradual increase in phytoplankton biomass. An extremely high runoff
   event caused by a storm at the end of August resulted in a flushing of
   the entire freshwater tidal reach. Phytoplankton biomass dropped and the
   estuarine phytoplankton community was replaced with one of riverine
   origin which was not adapted to the growth conditions prevailing within
   the estuary. Afterwards, autochthonous phytoplankton populations were
   not able to recover due to the presence of grazers and a general
   decrease in light levels and temperature. Our results illustrate how
   freshets may influence phytoplankton dynamics directly through
   longitudinal transport of phytoplankton populations and indirectly by
   influencing nutrient levels and grazer populations.}},

Abstract = {{The authors conducted a cross-sectional study among residents of Delhi
   to determine the role of ambient air pollution in chronic respiratory
   morbidity in Delhi. The authors selected a random, stratified sample (N
   = 4,171) of permanent residents who were 18+ y of age and who lived near
   1 of the 9 permanent air quality monitoring stations in the city.
   Air-quality data for the past 10 y were obtained; data were based on the
   differences in total suspended particulates, and the study areas were
   categorized into lower- and higher-pollution zones. A standardized
   questionnaire was administered, clinical examination was carried out,
   and spirometry followed. The authors assessed chronic respiratory
   morbidity by (a) prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms (i.e.,
   chronic cough, phlegm, breathlessness, and wheezing) and airway diseases
   (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/chronic bronchitis and
   bronchial asthma); and (b) lung function results in asymptomatic
   nonsmoking subjects in the two pollution zones. A multiple logistic
   regression identified the determinants of chronic symptoms. Smoking,
   male sex, increasing age, and lower socioeconomic status were strong
   independent risk factors for occurrence of chronic respiratory symptoms.
   In the comparison of nonsmoking residents of lower- and higher-pollution
   zones-stratified according to socioeconomic levels and sex-chronic
   cough, chronic phlegm, and dyspnea (but not wheezing) were significantly
   more common in the higher-pollution zone in only some of the strata.
   Furthermore, prevalence rates of bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, and chronic bronchitis among residents in the two
   pollution zones were not significantly different. Nonetheless, lung
   function of asymptomatic nonsmokers was consistently and significantly
   better among both male and female residents of the lower-pollution zone.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife conservationists and managers must address a wide range of
   issues relating to bird populations including sustainable management of
   the wider countryside, the protection of individual sites and site
   networks and proper ly planned species recovery. Sound approaches to
   these problems need to be based on a good understanding of the
   population processes involved. Much of the research that provides such
   understanding is based on ringing, which is used to measure many aspects
   of avian demography, particularly survival rates, recruitment and
   dispersal. Ringing studies have allowed the demographic causes of
   population declines to be identified, providing indications and tests of
   their environmental causes. Spatial population modelling, supported by
   good empirical data on dispersal, has the potential to contribute to
   both species and landscape conservation. The success of rehabilitation
   and reintroduction programmes can often be evaluated from studies of
   marked birds. Descriptions of patterns of movements form an essential
   part of the information required to manage flyway populations and site
   networks. Ringing is also a key component of research into the effects
   of hunting because it can be used to measure both harvest and survival
   rates. The control of gull populations illustrates the application of
   population dynamics principles to reduce population size. The
   contribution of ringing to conservation science during the 21(st)
   century can be enhanced by using information technology to improve the
   use of existing information and data, by undertaking more long-term
   monitoring and through giving careful attention to the design of
   research projects.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for identifying the proximate demographic cause(s) of
   population decline at two spatial scales is proposed and evaluated. The
   approach involves modelling spatial variation in vital rates
   (productivity and survivorship) as a function of spatial variation in
   population trends. Productivity indices and time-constant annual adult
   survival-rats estimates were modelled from the Monitoring Avian
   Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) Program. For the larger scale,
   productivity and survivorship of Gray Catbird Dumetella carolinensis
   during 1992-98 were modelled from stations in areas comprised of
   physiographic strata where the breeding bird survey (BBS) population
   trend was either significantly positive or negative. Adult survival-rate
   estimates were area-dependent while productivity indices were
   independent of area. Differences in modelled population changes agreed
   well with differences in BBS population trends, although the modelled
   population changes for both areas were substantially more negative than
   BBS trends. Although MAPS productivity indices appear to be biased low,
   these results suggest that low survival of adults was the proximate
   demographic cause of population decline in catbirds in physiographic
   strata where they were declining, and that management strategies to
   reverse the declines in catbirds by increasing their productivity will
   not be successful. At the smaller scale, productivity and survivorship
   were modelled during 1994-99 for Carolina Chickadee Poecile
   carolinensis, Gray Catbird, Ovenbird Sciurus aurocapillus,
   Yellow-breasted Chat Icteria virens, and Field Sparrow Spizella pusilla
   from stations on military installations in Kansas and Missouri (western
   Midwest) and Indiana and Kentucky (eastern Midwest). Selected species
   were those whose trend in adult captures over the six years 1994-99 was
   significantly positive or negative in the eastern or western Midwest and
   of the opposite sign (but not necessarily significant) in the other
   area. We were able to identify the proximate dempographic cause(s) of
   population decline for each species. Moreover, the regression of
   modelled population change on trend in adult captures showed a
   significant positive relationship, although the y-intercept was negative
   (-0.418), again suggesting that MAPS productivity indices are biased
   low, but that the biases are relatively constant between areas and among
   species. The short-comings of this approach are discussed. We conclude
   that the approach is in deed useful for identifying the proximate
   demographic cause of population change, but that an optimal approach
   would include consideration of both spatial and temporal variation in
   vital rates and population treads.}},

Abstract = {{An Integrated Population Monitoring (IPM) programme is being developed
   for wildfowl (Anatidae) in the United Kingdom. This aims to monitor the
   demographic processes that regulate population size and distribution, to
   identify requirements for the maintenance of populations and to provide
   data to predict the effects of demographic or environmental changes on
   populations. Ringing plays a central role in this programme, in
   particular for monitoring survival rates and movements. Data from marked
   individuals are also important for determining the effects of hunting on
   wildfowl populations. Despite the long history of wildfowl ringing in
   the United Kingdom, current ringing activity does not fulfil the
   objectives of IPM. In particular, the lack of computerisation of data,
   outdated survival estimates and analysis methods (especially for ducks),
   geographical bias in ringing activity, declining sample sizes and lack
   of comprehensive harvest data for quarry populations all place a serious
   constraint on the application of IPM to wildfowl in the United Kingdom.
   These problems have been addressed in the development of a ringing
   strategy for wildfowl in the United Kingdom, which will be implemented
   by The Wildfowl \& Wetlands Trust as part of an Integrated Population
   Monitoring programme for wildfowl.}},

Abstract = {{The economic importance of mining in the Indian Desert is second only,
   to agriculture. Land disturbed by, mining, however, has only recently,
   been the focus of rehabilitation efforts. This research assesses the
   success of rehabilitation plans used to revegetate gypsum mine spoils
   within the environmental constraints of the northwest Indian hot-desert
   ecosystem. The rehabilitation plan first examined both mined and unmined
   areas and established assessments of existing vegetative cover and the
   quality, of native soils and mine spoils. Tests were made on the effect
   of the use, and conservation, of available water through rainwater
   harvesting, amendment application (for physical and chemical spoil
   modification), plant establishment protocols, and the selection of
   appropriate germ plasm. Our results show that the resulting vegetative
   cover is capable of perpetuating itself under natural conditions while
   concurrently, meeting the needs of farmers. Although the mine spoils are
   deficient in organic matter and phosphorus, they, possess adequate
   amounts of all other nutrients. Total boron concentrations (> 5.0 mg
   kg(-1)) in both the topsoil and mine spoil indicate potentially
   phytotoxie conditions. Electrical conductance of mine spoil is 6-10
   times higher than for topsoil with a near-neutral pH. Populations of
   spoil fungi, Azotobactor, and nitrifying bacteria are low. The soil
   moisture storage in rainwater harvesting plots increased by 8\% over the
   control and 48\% over the unmined area. As a result of rehabilitation
   efforts, mine spoils show a steady, buildup in organic carbon, and P and
   K due to the decomposition of farmyard manure and the contribution of
   nitrogen fixation by, the established leguminous plant species. The
   rehabilitation protocol used at the site appears to have been
   successful. Following revegetation of the area with a mixture of trees,
   shrubs, and grasses, native unplanted species have become established.
   Species diversity,, measured in terms of species richness, increased
   after one year and then gradually, declined over time; the decline was
   the result of the loss of annual species. The stud), not only, develops
   methods of gypsum mine land rehabilitation but also helps in
   understanding processes of rehabilitation success in arid regions and
   emphasizes the importance Of long-term monitoring of rehabilitation
   success.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of statistical methods for meteorological adjustment of ozone
   have been proposed in the literature over the last decade for purposes
   of forecasting, estimating ozone time trends, or investigating
   underlying mechanisms from an empirical perspective. The methods can be
   broadly classified into regression, extreme value, and space-time
   methods. We present a critical review of these methods, beginning with a
   summary of what meteorological and ozone monitoring data have been
   considered and how they have been used for statistical analysis. We give
   particular attention to the question of trend estimation, and compare
   selected methods in an application to ozone time series From the Chicago
   area. We conclude that a number of approaches make useful contributions
   to the field, but that no one method is most appropriate for all
   purposes and all meteorological scenarios. Methodological issues such as
   the need for regional-scale analysis, the nonlinear dependence of ozone
   on meteorology, and extreme value analysis for trends are addressed. A
   comprehensive and reliable methodology for space-time extreme value
   analysis is attractive but lacking. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Chile has more than 330 000 ha of eucalypt plantations, predominantly in
   the eighth to the tenth region (approximately 34 to 41 degreesS).
   Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus is the principal eucalypt planted, but
   Eucalyptus nitens, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus delegatensis and
   Eucalyptus viminalis are also grown. There are four main insect pests
   that have been detected attacking these eucalypts in Chile: the
   defoliator Gonipterus scutellatus, the bark borers Phoracantha
   semipunctata and Phoracantha recurva and the native wood borer
   Chilecomadia valdiviana. More recently, Thyrinteina arnobia and
   Ctenarytaina eucalypti have been detected. Gonipterus scutellatus and P.
   recurva have been discovered in Chile within the last 2 years and it is
   hoped they may still be eliminated using a combination of biological
   control and chemical control of local populations. Phoracantha recurva
   and P. semipunctata are not considered a problem because attack only
   occurs in areas of water deficit, away from current eucalypt
   plantations. Chilecomadia valdiviana can damage plantations of E. nitens
   but rarely attacks other eucalypts. Chilecomadia valdiviana may cause
   future problems through further host shifts. Thyrinteina arnobia has
   only been detected during quarantine surveillance in the port of
   Valparaiso. Ctenarytaina eucalypti, recently detected in August 1999,
   had an initial limited distribution in the first region. However, since
   then, this insect has expanded its distribution south up to the tenth
   region. None of the insects recorded on eucalypts in Chile to date
   currently presents a threat to the eucalypt industry. It is also
   essential that additional resources are made available for their
   continued monitoring and control, particularly given that the 44\% of
   plantations are held by small to medium property owners that would
   otherwise be unable to control a serious outbreak because of economic
   restrictions.}},

Title = {{Changes in nematode populations on sugarcane following fallow,
   fumigation and crop rotation, and implications for the role of nematodes
   in yield decline}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{323-335}},
Abstract = {{A multi-disciplinary research program has been established in Australia
   to identify the causes of sugarcane yield decline (defined as `the loss
   in productive capacity of sugarcane-growing soils under long-term
   monoculture'). In one part of that program, five experiments were set up
   in which the monoculture was broken for 12-42 months by maintaining a
   bare fallow using herbicides, by growing a grass/legume pasture or by
   planting consecutive crops, most of which were legumes. Other plots were
   maintained in continuous sugarcane during the break period and were
   either fumigated with methyl bromide immediately before replanting to
   sugarcane, or left untreated. Nematode populations were monitored in the
   following sugarcane crop. These data showed that for the first 6 months
   after planting, fumigation, bare fallow and crop generally reduced
   populations of Pratylenchus zeae Graham in comparison to continuous
   sugarcane. Pasture had a similar effect but it was only apparent at, or
   soon after, planting. Fumigation and bare fallow initially decreased
   populations of most other plant-parasitic nematodes, but some
   ectoparasitic species {[}e.g. Tylenchorhynchus annulatus (Cassidy)
   Golden and Paratylenchus colbrani (Raski)] returned to relatively high
   population densities within 6-12 months following these treatments at
   some sites. Pasture generally increased populations of free-living
   nematodes in comparison to continuous sugarcane whereas a decrease was
   sometimes observed following fumigation and bare fallow. All treatments
   increased the yield of the plant plus first ratoon crop by 20-30\%
   compared with continuous sugarcane, indicating that soil factors
   affected by fumigation and break crops were having widespread and
   significant effects on sugar production in Australia. A reduction in
   nematode populations may have contributed to the yield responses at some
   sites but it is impossible to be conclusive because treatments also
   affected many other soil physical, chemical and biological properties.}},

   Oxygen consumption and embryonic growth were monitored throughout

   both temperatures. Eggs hatched after 79 and 53 days incubation at 26
   degreesC and 30 degreesC respectively. Oxygen consumption at both
   temperatures increased to a peak several days before hatching, a pattern
   typical of turtle embryos, and the rate of oxygen was higher at 30
   degreesC than 26 degreesC. The total amount of energy consumed during
   incubation, and hatchling dimensions, were similar at both temperatures,
   but hatchlings from 26 degreesC had larger mass, larger yolk-free mass
   and smaller residual yolks than hatchlings from 30 degreesC. Because of
   the difference in mass of hatchlings, hatchlings from 30 degreesC had a
   higher production cost.}},

Abstract = {{This study sought to investigate the potential for gene flow and
   dispersal between three sampled populations of urban Melbourne foxes
   (Vulpes vulpes). Five highly polymorphic canine microsatellites were
   used to investigate the population structure of foxes. The dispersal of
   14 foxes, captured and radio-collared as cubs, were monitored
   periodically over two years. Dispersal estimates for males and females
   were also calculated from published regression equations that related
   social group density to dispersal distance. Genetic differentiation
   between urban populations was greater than between more widely spaced
   rural populations and was also greater than that found between San Remo
   and Phillip Island populations, which are separated by a water barrier.
   A deficiency of heterozygotes was detected in the total Melbourne
   population, but not at any of the field sites. Mean dispersal distances
   after 24 months (male = 3.5 km, female = 2.0 km) compared well with
   published accounts of dispersal in British cities. Dispersal distance
   estimates for female foxes from all sites were lower than straight-line
   distance for all but one site. Both the genetic and ecological data
   suggest a restricted ability for foxes to disperse between sites within
   urban Melbourne.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding success of clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa) ex situ is very
   poor and behavioral problems, such as fur-plucking, tail-chewing,
   excessive hiding or pacing, and inter-sexual aggression resulting in
   mate killing, are common occurrences. For the establishment of a
   self-sustaining captive population it is of utmost importance to
   identify the causes of such problems and provide solutions that will
   enhance breeding success. This study was undertaken to investigate
   whether some of these problems may be indicators of chronic stress and
   whether there may be associations between specific management factors
   and observed behavioral problems. Animal managers and keepers alike have
   often felt that clouded leopards may be particularly prone to
   captivity-stress, i.e., chronic stress associated specifically with the
   captive environment. It is known for other mammalian species that
   chronic stress can be linked to the occurrence of abnormal behaviors,
   the disruption of reproductive function, and a variety of diseases and
   immunosuppression. Currently little information is available about many
   of the basic husbandry and management requirements in clouded leopards.
   Thus, the observed behavioral, health and breeding problems may indeed
   provide first indications of negative effects resulting from chronically
   elevated adrenal activity due to inappropriate management regimens.}},

Abstract = {{Blue-and-gold macaws (Ara ararauna), once found in the Nariva Swamp in
   Trinidad, were extirpated in the 1960's because of nest poaching for the
   pet trade and habitat alteration. In 1993, the Forestry Division of
   Trinidad and Tobago, The Centre for the Rescue of Endangered Species of
   Trinidad and Tobago (CRESTT) and the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden
   embarked on a mission to restore this species to its island habitat.
   Food source and nest site surveys indicated that this now protected
   wetland could still support a population of reintroduced Blue-and-gold
   macaws. After several unsuccessful attempts to obtain chicks for release
   through captive breeding, a pilot study on the reintroduction of
   wild-caught birds was implemented. In 1999, nine potential pairs (18
   birds) were imported from stable wild populations in Guyana. After
   quarantines, testing and physical examinations, the birds spent four
   weeks in a pre-release flight cage located in a protected wildlife
   sanctuary within the Nariva Swamp. They were monitored by local
   villagers and introduced to natural foods of the area. Over a period of
   three months, 14 birds were released (eight males and six females). More
   than one-year later, nine macaws continue to be sighted in the wild.
   Behavioral observations of six of these birds during February to May
   2001 suggest nesting activity. Trained local villagers in the
   communities bordering the swamp have been monitoring flight patterns and
   potential nesting sites of the released birds. Education programs have
   helped rural communities and schools to learn more about the sustainable
   use of the Nariva wetlands. Private and corporate sponsors and the media
   have raised public awareness island-wide to the significance of this
   conservation effort.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective is to protect the general public from hazardous abandoned

   the abandoned underground mine workings. In Pennsylvania the largest
   known bat concentrations are dependent on man-made habitat. Annual
   surveys to locate and monitor large winter roosts were begun in 1980.
   The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), northern long-eared bat (Myotis
   septentrionalis), eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii), little brown
   bat (Myotis lucifugus), big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), and eastern
   pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus) use mine entries to access areas
   for winter roosts. Conservation management included but was not limited
   to construction of bat-friendly steel gates to protect hibernacula.
   Approximately 10\% of the studied abandoned mine entries were occupied
   by bats and were preserved by gating. The vulnerability of such habitat
   and large concentrations of bats require both proactive and reactive
   management.}},

   cultivated with durum wheat in central and southern Italy. Several
   populations of A. sterilis ssp ludoviciana and P. paradoxa proved to be
   resistant to one or more ACCase inhibitor herbicides. Two fields where
   the resistance situation was particularly serious were chosen for field
   experiments. Three years of experiments testing the efficacy of chemical
   and agronomic means for controlling resistant A. sterilis and P.
   paradoxa are presented. The emergence dynamics of the two resistant
   species was also determined in the same fields. For both species the
   situation appears to be evolving slowly. No single chemical or agronomic
   treatment solved the problem of resistant populations. False seedbed
   preparation and some alternative herbicides proved to be useful in
   controlling resistant populations. Integrated weed management appears to
   be the best solution.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread use of chlorinated solvents has resulted in contamination of
   groundwater requiring effective source and plume containment strategies
   to prevent contaminant migration and mitigate adverse environmental
   impacts. The Bachman Road Residential Wells Site is contaminated with
   predominantly tetrachloroethene (PCE) and the contaminant plume flows
   into Lake Huron. Due to natural dechlorination processes, some of the
   PCE has been transformed to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE), with
   lesser amounts of trichloroethene (TCE) and chloroethene (VC).
   Laboratory and field investigations demonstrated the presence of a PCE
   to cis-DCE dechlorinating Desulfuromonas species and the presence of a
   Dehalococcoides species, which completely dechlorinates chloroethenes to
   ethene. Both populations are known to use chloroethenes as metabolic
   electron acceptors. A bioaugmentation strategy using these
   microorganisms at the pilot scale has resulted in complete
   dechlorination of the groundwater in less than 50 days. Additionally, a
   16S rDNA-based molecular approach was developed to track the PCE to
   cis-DCE and the chloroethene dechlorinating species. This methodology
   allows us to quantitatively track the populations of interest, monitor
   their migration and to develop cause and effect relationships with
   contaminant degradation. This field demonstration illustrates that
   bioaugmentation using halorespiring microorganisms is a viable
   alternative for preventing contaminant migration into associated surface
   water systems.}},

Abstract = {{Coincident with other amphibians around the world Aneides aeneus, a
   terrestrial plethodontid salamander, suffered a population collapse in a
   disjunct portion of its range in the mid-late 1970s. Long-term
   monitoring of seven historical green salamander populations throughout
   the 1990s showed a 98\% decline in relative abundance since 1970. Three
   out of six populations first discovered in 1991 also crashed in
   1996-1997. The synchronized suddenness of the declines, their
   region-wide impact, and effects on both small and larger populations,
   suggest the role of a novel agent of mortality beginning in the mid-late
   1970s. Acting alone, but more likely in concert, habitat loss,
   overcollecting, epidemic disease and climate change could account for
   this region-wide decline. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ecteinascidin-743 (ET-743) is a tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid produced
   by Ecteinascidia turbinata, an Atlanto-Mediterranean species growing in
   mangroves and coastal meadows. Preclinical and early clinical trials
   revealed high cytotoxic activity of ET-743 against several resistant
   human tumours. Phase II studies with ET-743 are being performed at
   different Cancer centres in Europe and the United States. More than 600
   patients suffering from breast, renal sarcomas and melanoma have been
   treated with ET-743. In correlation with preclinical models, high
   activity was observed in cases of advanced sarcoma which had relapsed or
   were resistant to conventional therapy.
   The supply of ET-743 for clinical development is being maintained by
   large-scale extraction of the compound from the producing organism.
   Harvesting of this tunicate in large quantities is possible with the
   establishment of sea farming in exclusive mariculture facilities.
   Monitoring of different natural populations of E. turbinata from several
   Mediterranean and Caribbean sites, allows local adaptations on the
   cultivation devices according to the biological requirements of this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The first field pilot-scale demonstration of a technology for in situ
   remediation of vadose zone soils contaminated with high explosives (HE)
   has been performed at the Department of Energy's Pantex Plant. The HE of
   concern at the demonstration site were RDX and 1,3,5-TNB, with
   concentrations ranging from 5 to 35 ppm, above the risk reduction
   clean-up criteria of 2.6 and 0.51 ppm, respectively. The shallow (<10 in
   depth) soils at the site could not be excavated due to the presence of
   buried utilities. Based on previous laboratory studies, it was found
   that the impacted soils had indigenous microbial populations that could
   be encouraged to reduce the RDX and TNB. A five-spot well pattern, with
   injection at the central well and extraction at the four outer wells
   (each 4.6 in from the injection well), was used to flood the target
   vadose zone soils with nitrogen gas with the intent of stimulating the
   HE degraders. The system was monitored periodically for gas composition
   as well as HE concentrations and microbial activity in retrievable soil
   samples. After 295 days of treatment, the target HE concentrations
   dropped by 40 percent from the initial site. Operation of the site
   continues.}},

Abstract = {{The inhibitory and toxic impact of metal ions needs to be quantified for
   maintaining a stable process for the treatment of metal-bearing
   sulfate-rich wastewaters using sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The
   ultimate toxic concentrations of zinc and copper (lowest concentration
   at which no sulfate reduction activity was detected) were found to be 20
   mg/L and 12 mg/L respectively for an acetate utilizing mixed culture of
   SRB. The EC50 (initial metal ion concentration at which the activity of
   the culture is reduced by 50\%) values were obtained from the ionic
   concentration measurements and found to be 16.5 mg/L and 10.5 mg/L for
   zinc and copper respectively. The metal sulfides formed due to reaction
   between metal ions in the solution and biogenic sulfide inhibited the
   sulfate reducing activity of the SRB. The effect of metal ions on an
   active, growing culture of SRB was investigated by spiking copper/zinc
   ion into the batch reactors containing acetate-utilizing SRB. The
   bioactivity was monitored through physico-chemical measurements of pH,
   oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), ionic concentrations in the reactor
   and hydrogen sulfide concentration in the headspace. The actual
   concentrations of the metal ions after spiking were much lower than
   calculated concentrations and ranged from 5-10 mg/L indicating a
   significant level of sulfide protection in the reactors. The sulfate
   reduction activity of the reactors gradually resumed as could be seen
   from the increase in the pH and a decrease in the ORP. The reactors did
   not change over to methanogenic mode based on the analysis of the
   headspace gas sample. The microbial population measurements using an MPN
   technique indicated that the active SRB population decreased after
   exposure to metal ion.}},

Abstract = {{White-beaked Dolphins are common and abundant in the north Atlantic.
   Abundance appears greater in northeastern areas compared to the
   northwestern Atlantic where its range extends from Davis Strait to the
   Hague Line on George's Bank, and into U.S. waters. Relationships between
   populations observed in different areas are not known. Total or local
   populations are not known to be reduced or depleted. The biology and
   ecology of this species has been incompletely studied. It occurs in
   social groups ranging from dozens to hundreds of individuals: there is
   some indication that groups may segregate based on age/maturity. Sexual
   maturity occurs in females at lengths from 1.74 to 2.49 m; 50\% are
   mature at 2.42 m. Males are larger at sexual maturity (2.51 to 2.57 m).
   Factors limiting northwestern Atlantic White-beaked Dolphins may include
   hunting. incidental entrapments in fishing gear, ice entrapments and,
   possibly, pollution. Such factors should be monitored carefully but are
   not, at present, believed to have substantial impacts on the species,
   although there may be reduction of some local populations. Factors such
   as ice entrapments, parasites, infections. mass strandings and predation

   monitored using visual belt transects. Significant differences in
   species richness and abundance of juveniles were identified among
   distinct patch reef, seagrass, rubble, algal plains, and sand habitats
   within the three embayments. Patch reef had the highest species
   diversity among habitats in the three areas. Scarids, labrids, and
   haemulids were the most abundant families sampled, Teague Bay had the
   highest fish density per site, while Yellowcliff Bay had the highest
   species density. The slippery dick Halichoeres bivittatus, the bucktooth
   parrotfish Sparisoma radians, and Haemulon spp. were the most abundant
   species. There were significant seasonal differences in fish relative
   abundance and species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Diadema antillarum and Tripneustes ventricosus were
   monitored on the forereef and backreef at Discovery Bay, Jamaica, from
   1995 to 2000. On the primarily coralline substrate of the forereef, T.
   ventricosus densities were normally low but showed a ten-fold increase
   in 1998, followed by a decline to normal levels. On the backreef, with
   both coral and seagrass, T. ventricosus densities were normally higher
   but a similar peak occurred in 1999. Diadema antillarum densities
   remained relatively constant on the backreef but declined on the
   forereef in 1998, and then increased rapidly. Both urchins remained on
   their respective coral and seagrass habitats on the backreef, but
   occurred together in similar habitat on the forereef. We propose that
   the appearance and subsequent decline of T. ventricosus enabled D.
   antillarum to increase after T. ventricosus had mechanically cropped
   macroalgae to levels easier for D. antillarum to manage. This
   explanation suggests that the ephemeral appearance of T. ventricosus on
   coral covered with macroalgae can act as a successional stage for the
   reestablishment of D. antillarum.}},

Title = {{The ecosystem approach to managing fisheries: Achieving conservation
   objectives for predators of fished species}},
Journal = {{CCAMLR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{37-64}},
Abstract = {{Managing fisheries to achieve ecosystem objectives is in its infancy. A
   general approach is proposed for maintaining ecological relationships
   and providing for the recovery of depleted populations in food webs
   supporting fisheries. This paper addresses the following general
   questions for applying the ecosystem approach to managing fisheries: (i)
   how might fisheries impact incidentally on an ecosystem, (ii) what
   should be the conservation objectives for predators of fished species,
   and (iii) what approaches could be considered for achieving the
   conservation objectives? The approach proposed here takes account of
   uncertainties in knowledge of the structure of ecosystems. Estimates of
   predator production arising from the consumption of fished species
   (encapsulated in proposed indices P and W) may provide useful indicators
   for management purposes because they integrate across a range of
   `ecosystem' effects and, as formulated here, can also be related
   directly to the effects of fishing. These features are currently
   unavailable in ecosystem approaches to managing fisheries, which do not
   weight input data for assessments, such as per-capita breeding success,
   according to the relative influence of fished species on those
   estimates. The paper describes the steps required to establish
   management procedures based on these indices.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of climate change on drinking-waterborne cryptosporidiosis
   transmission in the United States are analyzed using an influence
   diagram representation of epidemic development. Results from a
   systematic qualitative analysis indicate that climate change will have
   little effect on cryptosporidiosis incidence if the United States
   continues to be wealthy and maintains its commitment to public health.
   The major impact will, instead, be the additional costs of adapting to
   new climate regimes in order to avoid drinking-waterborne disease risk.
   These costs, for the most part, will be from improved monitoring and
   treatment of drinking water. The consequences of disaster scenarios are
   also considered. These, too, suggest that climate change per se will be
   a poor predictor of waterborne cryptosporidiosis in countries with high
   standards of living. Rather, the risk of epidemics will depend on the
   interplay between population, public health investment, infrastructure
   maintenance, emergency planning/response capabilities, water-treatment
   technologies, drinking-water regulations, and climate.}},

Abstract = {{Modem ecological silviculture in Germany is still lacking quantified
   parameters to improve and monitor biodiversity. We hypothesize that not
   only the occurrence of rare species, but also the simple presence of
   habitat structures at the forest stand and forest mosaic level fulfil
   the criteria of sustainable biodiversity in managed forests. Because no
   operational definitions of biodiversity are available yet, a
   species-habitat model was developed based on the umbrella function of an
   indicator species, here Capercaillie in the Black Forest region. We
   found that the Black Forest provides enough potential habitat for the
   survival of a Capercaillie meta-population (ca. 60 000 ha). Considering
   the specific habitat affinity of Capercaillie, a framework of structural
   habitat parameters was transferred into a silvicultural model. Such a
   species-habitat model provides the methodological basis for: (a) forest
   managing towards sustainable biodiversity; and (b) the success control
   of specific silvicultural measures.}},

Title = {{Genetic modification of herbaceous plants for feed and fuel}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-49}},
Abstract = {{Much of the research on the genetic modification of herbaceous plant
   cell walls has been conducted to improve the utilization of forages by
   ruminant livestock. The rumen of these animals is basically an anaerobic
   fermentation vat in which the microflora break down the complex
   polysaccharides of plant cell walls into simpler compounds that can be
   further digested and absorbed by the mammalian digestive system.
   Research on improving the forage digestibility of switchgrass, Panicum
   virgatum L., and other herbaceous species has demonstrated that genetic
   improvements can be made in forage quality that can have significant
   economic value. To meet future energy needs, herbaceous biomass will
   need to be converted into a liquid fuel, probably ethanol, via
   conversion technologies still under development. If feedstock quality
   can be genetically improved, the economics and efficiency of the
   conversion processes could be significantly enhanced. Improving an
   agricultural product for improved end product use via genetic
   modification requires knowledge of desired quality attributes, the
   relative economic value of the quality parameters in relation to yield,
   genetic variation for the desired traits, or for molecular breeding,
   knowledge of genes to suppress or add, and knowledge of any associated
   negative consequences of genetic manipulation. Because conversion
   technology is still under development, desirable plant feedstock
   characteristics have not been completely delineated. Some traits such as
   cellulose and Lignin concentration will undoubtably be important. Once
   traits that affect biomass feedstock conversion are identified, it will
   be highly feasible to genetically modify the feedstock quality of
   herbaceous plants using both conventional and molecular breeding
   techniques. The use of molecular markers and transformation technology
   will greatly enhance the capability of breeders to modify the
   morphologic structure and cell walls of herbaceous species. It will be
   necessary to monitor gene flow to remnant wild populations of biomass
   plants and have strategies available to curtail gene flow if it becomes
   a potential problem. It will also be necessary to monitor plant survival
   and longterm productivity as affected by these genetic changes to
   herbaceous species.}},

Abstract = {{The development of the Mekong delta is an urgent matter for the
   Vietnamese authorities. It is aimed to improve the rice cultivation to
   meet the food supply for the increasing population and to stimulate the
   export facilities for rice. Moreover, large-scale public works are
   foreseen, including the deepening of the estuary to improve the
   accessibility of the area. The coastal plain of the Mekong delta is
   subject to a severe degree of salt penetration through the major rivers
   and creeks. These saline intrusions form a limiting factor for the
   development of the rice cultivation.
   In the frame of a pilot project of the Telsat4-programme (OSTC,
   Brussels-Belgium), a user-friendly tool for the detection of waterlogged
   areas in macro-estuaria characterised by a wet-tropical hydrology is set
   up. Results are presented for the monitoring of waterlogged areas and
   changes in humidity using a multitemporal data set of ERS-2 images.}},

Title = {{Reproduction and management of black lion tamarins Leontopithecus

Journal = {{DODO}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{34-40}},
Abstract = {{The recovery programme for the critically endangered black lion tamarin
   Leontopithecus chrysopygus is based on a metapopulation management
   strategy. As part of this, black lion tamarins have been maintained at
   Jersey Zoo since 1990. Some problems with reproduction have occurred
   which have not been experienced with related species. Historical records
   on reproduction of this species were therefore examined and compared
   with two other Leontopithecus species maintained at Jersey Zoo, the
   golden lion tamarin L. rosalia and the golden-headed lion tamarin L.
   chrysomelas. Two of five potentially breeding female black lion tamarins
   failed to reproduce. This did not occur in either of the other two
   species. Furthermore, black lion tamarins had a lower infant survival
   rate than either of the other two species. This was not due to
   inadequate parental behaviour, as rejection of infants never occurred in
   black lion tamarins; infant mortality was a result of a high level of
   premature and stillbirths (more than 30\% of all infants born) and
   further losses of full-term live-born infants, one female persistently
   losing one infant from each twin litter. These problems occurred much
   less frequently in the other two species. In golden-headed lion
   tamarins, in contrast, there were high levels of infant rejection and
   also smaller litter sizes at birth. A preliminary assessment of
   management changes suggests that a higher protein diet may reduce the
   incidence of premature and stillbirths and that careful monitoring may
   help ensure the survival of live-born infants. Improving reproductive
   success in the captive population is a vital part of the metapopulation
   management strategy for black lion tamarins.}},

Title = {{Comparative reproduction in wild and captive female ploughshare
   tortoises Geochelone yniphora}},
Journal = {{DODO}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{70-79}},
Abstract = {{The ploughshare tortoise Geochelone yniphora, the most threatened
   endemic tortoise in Madagascar, is only found in five fragmented sites
   covering 6,600 ha within Baly Bay National Park, north-western
   Madagascar. It has an estimated population of about 600 individuals,
   which are threatened by frequent bush fires. Field research was
   undertaken from 1993, principally at Cape Sada. A captive breeding
   centre was established at Ampijoroa Forestry Station in September 1986,
   through collaboration between Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust
   (previously Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust) and the Government of
   Madagascar, to provide a ``safety net{''} and to prepare for potential
   future reinforcement of the wild population. This study investigated
   differential reproduction in adult female ploughshare tortoises from the
   wild population at Cape Sada and from the captive breeding population at
   Ampijoroa. At Ampijoroa, data were collected from 1988 to 2000 for eight
   females. We observed a total of 180 nests with 657 eggs. At Cape Sada,
   data were collected from 1994 to 2000 by radiotracking females and
   monitoring nests, and 86 nests with 279 eggs were observed. At
   Ampijoroa, the mean number of nests per female for any one year varied
   from 4.0 to 6.4, while at Cape Sada the mean number of nests recorded
   per female for each year varied from 1.5 to 3.0. The mean number of
   nests per female per year was thus much higher in captivity (5.6,
   compared with 2.1 in the wild). The mean fertility rate in the wild
   (68.5\%) was marginally higher than at Ampijoroa (67.2\%), and also
   slightly less variable between females and between years. In the wild
   mean hatchability was 77.4\%, whereas in captivity it was 71.1\%, with
   greater variability between years and females. The nesting period was
   longer in captivity, from December to July, whereas all wild nestings
   observed occurred from January to June, with fewer nests and smaller
   clutch sizes in the ``border{''} months (December and July at Ampijoroa,
   January and June at Cape Sada). Fertility rate and hatching success at
   both sites were also lower in the early months of the nesting season,
   suggesting that, for both wild and captive females, early nesters have
   lower reproductive output. Despite lower average fertility rates and
   hatching success, 278\% more tortoises would be produced in captivity
   than in the wild in 10 female-years due to the higher production of
   nests and eggs. Techniques such as bringing adults into captivity for a
   period to boost their reproductive output could therefore be beneficial
   components of a metapopulation management strategy for this species.}},

Abstract = {{In tropical and subtropical countries a social gradient can be observed
   in mountainous regions between small-scale farmers on fragile ecosystems
   associated with human poverty, and the fertile plains and broad valleys
   with large-scale cash crop productions and industrial centers associated
   with relative economic welfare. Sustainable community development paths
   have to be identified in these less privileged regions. The objective of
   this study was to make a contribution for defining and assessing
   development indicators at community level, including ecological,
   economic and social dimensions, to elicit the conflicting objectives in
   development and to discuss some practical implications. The study was
   performed in a typical watershed in central Honduras and special
   attention was given to autochthonous and qualitative indicators for
   development. Using the pressure-state-response model as a framework, a
   series of indicators were identified and assessed, which were also used
   by the local population and grouped into landscape structure, soil
   fertility, water availability and quality, production system and
   extractive activities, economic and social performance, and
   institutions. The development path in this specific case illustrated the
   transition from an expansive forest conversion agriculture to an
   intensified and diversified agriculture. This was made possible through
   technology transfer and improved market access. However, this
   development path, while increasing economic welfare, generated
   increasing negative environmental impacts caused by pesticide residues,
   soil erosion and less regular water supply. As the watershed carrying
   capacity for traditional shifting cultivation (used as a system
   indicator) reached its ecological limit, new sustainable development
   strategies had to be identified. The implications of the study for
   policy design are that tools need to be provided for natural and
   environmental resource monitoring, which may consist of sustainability
   goal definitions, a minimal set of indicators and simple maps for
   planning land use at local level. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Mark-recapture statistics have rarely been applied to plants, yet they
   can be useful for estimating plant demographic traits where individuals
   may be missed or unobservable. We applied mark-recapture statistics
   based on an information theory approach to estimate annual probabilities
   of dormancy in a five-year study of a threatened, perennial plant, the
   small yellow lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus ssp.
   parviflorum (Salisb.) Fernald). The aboveground states of 548 genets in
   eight patches were monitored over five years. Apparent survival
   probabilities (phi), corrected for dormancy, were calculated. The
   best-fit model suggested that apparent survival was constant throughout
   the study for all patches, while dormancy varied additively with time
   among patches. The mean probability of dormancy was 0.320 +/- 0.024,
   with a mean maximum overestimation of 0.067 as calculated using an
   estimate of the probability of detection. Dormancy typically lasted for
   no longer than two consecutive years, although dormancy as long as four
   years was observed. Dormancy displayed a strong covariate relationship
   with spring frost days, although effects of precipitation and mean
   spring temperature were almost equally strong. Mean apparent survival
   probabilities were high in each patch (phi = 0.878), but dormancy
   probabilities varied considerably among patches (d = 0.188-0.672).
   Conventional resprouting probabilities underestimated apparent survival
   by a mean difference of 0.288 (range: 0.150-0.589). This novel
   application of mark-recapture statistics to plant demography allowed
   robust survival estimates that accounted for uncertainty due to an
   unobservable, dormant life stage.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the colonizing ability of a species is important for
   predicting its future distribution or for planning the introduction or
   reintroduction of that species for conservation purposes. The best way
   to assess colonizing ability is by making experimental introductions of
   the species and monitoring the outcome. In this study, different-sized
   propagules of Roesel's bush-cricket, Metrioptera roeseli, were
   experimentally introduced into 70 habitat islands, previously
   uninhabited by the species, in farmland fields in southeastern Sweden.
   The areas of introduction were carefully monitored for 2-3 yr to
   determine whether the propagules had successfully colonized the patches.
   The study showed that large propagules resulted in larger local
   populations during the years following introduction. Probability of
   colonization for each propagule size was measured and showed that
   propagule size had a significant effect on colonization success, i.e.,
   large propagules were more successful in colonizing new patches. If
   future introductions were to be made with this or a similar species, a
   propagule size of at least 32 individuals would be required to establish
   a viable population with a high degree of certainty.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Many populations of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas Rafinesque) in
   northern Alberta, Canada, contain individuals with hundreds of trematode
   (Ornithodiplostomum ptychocheilus Faust) cysts on the surface of their
   brains. Most cysts are located on the optic tecta, a region known to
   play a role in integrating visual and motor stimuli, especially in
   schooling fish. We determined the effect of infection on
   visually-mediated behaviours of fathead minnows by evaluating host
   performance in an optomotor swimming task. Monitoring this task involved
   recording the time minnows spent following a spinning drum, onto which
   alternating black and white stripes had been painted. After controlling
   for host activity and host size, minnows containing an average of 18
   (low-intensity) or 98 larvae (high-intensity) reduced their time spent
   following the spinning drum by 42\% and 26\%, respectively, compared to
   uninfected controls. Low-intensity minnows also took longer than
   controls to respond to a change in the direction of the spinning drum.
   Reduced optomotor performance has the potential to affect a host's
   ability to detect and respond to prey, predators and conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995 the Swiss people voted a constitutional article which tied
   agricultural subsidies to ecological requirements. Among other measures,
   farmers had to convert at least 7 \% of their land to semi-natural
   biotopes (ecological compensation areas - ECA). Major ECA are
   extensified grassland, traditional orchards, hedges, wild flower strips.
   The introduction of ECA throughout the country's agricultural area can
   be seen as a large scale landscape restoration experiment. Its
   biological effects are evaluated in a monitoring programme. Preliminary
   results show that endangered plant species are present on 42 \% of 582
   meadows examined in 1999, making up 29 \% of the 486 plant species
   recorded. Positive effects of ECA were recorded also with respect to
   butterflies, carabid beetles, and spiders. From the
   ``political-willingness-to-pay{''} a monetary value can be calculated as
   a measure of the importance which the population attaches to the
   biodiversity of agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The ``spotting{''} microarray technique, consisting in large sets of DNA
   sequences spotted on poly-L-lysine-coated glass microscope slides, was
   developed to analyze genome-wide patterns. It is a tool to
   quantitatively monitor gene expression profiles and to analyze the
   alterations produced by genetic diseases, or induced by treatments,
   abnormal nutrition, and toxins. The pre-Hilbert space of standard gene
   expression (SSGE), based on the normal variability in gene profiles of
   each population from the ecosystem, is introduced. In this space, every
   point represents a possible gene profile and every continuous curve a
   possible genetic evolution. The gene clusters are identified by the
   correlation coefficients and the prominent gene of every cluster
   selected from the criteria of highest connective power and smallest
   variability. We define the gene ``patholog{''} as the Euclidian distance
   separating the representative point of the population from the unit,
   0-centered hypersphere. It is the most general global quantification of
   the alteration in digital genes expression, suitable to evaluate the
   effects of various toxins at the level of any particular population. A
   publicly available database will be open where every experimentalist
   could introduce his/her results and process them according to our
   procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The semi-natural meadows belong to the most endangered plant communities
   in Slovakia. Very valuable grassland types are distributed in the
   National Park Poloniny - the Slovak part of the East Carpathians
   Biosphere Reserve (NE Slovakia), but large areas of grasslands are
   abandoned there. We established 14 permanent plots with different
   management regimes for the monitoring of changes in the structure of
   plant communities. Typical permanent plot consists of 4 larger squares
   (size 5x4 m) for recording of plant community and 4 smaller squares
   (size 1 x 1 in, divided into 9 parts) for recording of changes in plant
   populations.
   The species composition and abundance data are sampled each year,
   starting in 1994 and 1995. Aim of this research is to find optimal type
   of management which allow to keep typical structure and composition of
   plant communities and will be economically acceptable, as well. This set
   of permanent plots can be considered as representative for given
   territory, because it covers all endangered grassland communities and
   75\% of meadow and wetland plant species known from the territory.
   First results and their implication for management of grasslands in NP
   Poloniny are discussed in this paper. Because of East Carpathians
   Biosphere Reserve was identified as potential LTER site during ILTER
   workshop in Budapest (June 1999), possibilities for use of these plots
   for LTER site establishment are discussed, too.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of river regulations on the fish fauna was investigated in

   composition, abundance and density of particular species were specified
   for unregulated and regulated sections. It was found out that the number
   of species is higher in the unregulated sections than in the regulated
   ones. Quantitative evaluation showed that the impact of river
   regulations in the monitored sections are not necessarily negative. If
   the channel geometry of the regulated section is sufficiently irregular

Title = {{Parental investment in male and female offspring by the Peregrine
   Falcon, Falco peregrinus}},
Journal = {{EMU}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{95-103}},
Abstract = {{There is general theoretical agreement that parents should alter
   offspring sex ratios in response to the relative costs of producing and
   raising sexually dimorphic male and female offspring. Among raptors
   females are often much larger than males, yet there is little skew in
   nestling sex ratios at the population level. The food intake of male and
   female Peregrine Falcon, Falco peregrinus, nestlings was compared in
   order to investigate parental resource allocation to their highly
   size-dimorphic offspring. Intake of seven broods was measured by (i)
   counting the mouthfuls nestlings received during a feeding bout, and
   (ii) by monitoring their turnover of tritiated water, which was combined
   with the results of an earlier study of four broods. Despite significant
   differences in size, there was no significant difference in the daily
   food intake of male and female nestlings for about the first 21 days of
   the nestling period, after which time growth of males slowed. Females
   continued to grow and by the end of the nestling period their total
   weight and food intake exceeded those of males by 45\% and 25\%,
   respectively. We argue that many apparent discrepancies between studies
   on gender differences in food intake can be explained in part by the
   section of the nestling period that was monitored: any differences may
   not be apparent until the latter part of the nestling period. The crude
   growth efficiency of females was greater than that of males. It is
   concluded that female nestlings require a greater amount of food than do
   males, but because of greater growth efficiency, they need less than
   expected on the basis of body mass. A similar pattern was apparent in an
   interspecific comparison - the difference in food intake between the
   sexes of the more dimorphic species was less than expected on the basis
   of direct proportionality. In Peregrine Falcons, there was gender
   overlap in total food intake over the nestling period. Other studies
   show that individual nestlings in large broods consume less food than
   those in smaller broods. Together, these results indicate a wide range
   of variation in intake for successful growth. Lastly, resource
   allocation patterns in Peregrine Falcon nests seemed largely determined
   by sibling interactions. The closest nestling to the adult female during
   a feeding bout received the most food and no individual monopolised this
   position, regardless of gender or relative size or age. We propose that
   a regular supply of large prey to Peregrine Falcon nestlings makes
   dominance hierarchies unnecessary.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution from motor vehicles is an acute urban problem in many
   rapidly developing countries. Air quality monitoring in Israel has both
   demonstrated the severity of the problem in Israel and identified
   transportation emissions to be the major contributor to its etiology.
   Currently, a major concern is the high level of nitrogen oxide
   nonattainment in Tel Aviv. Thousands of nitrogen oxide violations are
   recorded there every year. This pollution both affects the local
   population and provides the driving factor behind the ozone formation
   downwind in Jerusalem and the West Bank. This paper presents the
   innovative effort to compile varying streams of data to create an urban
   vehicle emissions inventory for the city of Tel Aviv. The inventory
   provides an excellent understanding of the relative contributions of
   four air pollutants between and within each vehicle cluster. The major
   findings are that, of total urban vehicle emissions, cars purchased
   before 1993, when catalytic converters became mandatory, produce 60
   percent of carbon monoxide and 55 percent of hydrocarbon emissions. City
   buses produce 67 percent of nitrogen oxide and 39 percent of particulate
   matter emissions. Trucks and taxis each contribute about an eighth of
   total nitrogen oxide and a quarter of total particulate matter
   emissions. The major policy direction suggested by these findings is
   diesel fleet vehicle mitigation. In short, an effective approach is
   presented for industrializing nations to quickly assess their mobile
   pollution sources, and the foundation data are compiled for further
   mobile-source analyses in Israel.}},

Abstract = {{The elongated semi-enclosed Bay of Izmit, which receives both domestic
   and industrial wastes, has been monitored by measuring its physical and
   biochemical parameters for 2 years, 1994-1995. It is clear that there
   are two distinct water masses. The upper layer has been occupied by the
   less saline (22-26 ppt) waters of the Black Sea origin; whereas the
   lower layer contains saline (38.5 ppt) Mediterranean waters. The
   seasonal variations in the biochemical characteristics were dependent on
   the bay's two-layer flow system. If one considers the distribution of
   transparency in the upper bay waters, it has been observed that the
   Secchi disk depth (SDD) decreases from west to east. Furthermore, these
   depths are limited by the high primary productivity associated with the
   low concentrations of nutrients observed during the spring. Discharges
   of wastes into the surface waters significantly affect the biological
   production and oxygen consumption in the lower layer. Within the last 10
   years, 80\% of organic matter has been removed from industrial
   wastewater. However, organic loads from the domestic wastewaters have
   doubled because of the growth in the surrounding population.
   Fortunately, as a result, the total organic loads in the bay have not
   changed significantly within the last 10 years. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of genotoxic agents on exposed
   people have constituted an increasing concern. Therefore, the objective
   of this work was to assess DNA damage in lymphocytes of workers exposed
   to X-radiation using the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus test and the
   comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis), and to compare these two
   techniques in the monitoring of exposed populations. The
   cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus test and the comet assay were employed
   in the monitoring of 22 workers occupationally exposed to X-radiation in
   a hospital in southern Brazil. The frequency of dicentric bridges was
   also measured. The results of both assays and the frequency of dicentric
   bridges revealed a significant Increase in genetic effects on the cells
   of exposed individuals. Age was significantly correlated with
   micronucleus frequency and damage index in the comet assay. The
   concomitant analysis of dicentric bridges when determining micronucleus
   frequency does not require much extra work, and may serve as a reference
   to the type of mutagenic effect (clastogenic or aneugenic). The
   combination of the alkaline comet assay with the cytokinesis-blocked
   micronucleus test appears to be very informative for the monitoring of
   populations chronically exposed to genotoxic agents. Environ. Mal.

Abstract = {{Micronucleus (MN) expression in peripheral blood lympbocytes is well
   established as a standard method for monitoring chromosome damage in
   human populations. The First results of an analysis of pooled data from
   laboratories using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay and
   participating in the HUMN (HUman MicroNucleus project) international
   collaborative study are presented. The effects of laboratory protocol,
   scoring criteria, and host factors on baseline micronucleated binucleate
   cell (MNC) frequency are evaluated, and a reference range of
   ``normal{''} values against which future studies may be compared is
   provided. Primary data From historical records were submitted by 25
   laboratories distributed in 16 countries. This resulted in a database of
   nearly 7000 subjects. Potentially significant differences were present
   in the methods used by participating laboratories, such as in the type
   of culture medium, the concentration of cytochalasin-B, the percentage
   of fetal calf serum, and in the culture method. Differences in criteria
   For scoring micronuclei were also evident. The overall median MNC
   frequency in nonexposed (i.e., normal) subjects was 6.5 parts per
   thousand and the interquartile range was between 3 and 12 parts per
   thousand. An increase in MNC frequency with age was evident in all but
   two laboratories. The effect of gender, although not so evident in all
   databases, was also present, with females having a 19\% higher lever of
   MNC frequency (95\% confidence interval: 14-24\%). Statistical analyses
   were performed using random-effects models For correlated data. Our best
   model, which included exposure to genotoxic factors, host factors,
   methods, and scoring criteria, explained 75\% of the total variance,
   with the largest contribution attributable to laboratory methods. (C)

Abstract = {{The highly industrialized small town of Verkhnyaya Pyshma tin the Urals
   region of Russia) was chosen as the site of a multimedia-multipollutant
   risk assessment using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   methodology. The assessment was based on routine environmental pollution
   monitoring data for ambient air, soils, drinking water, and food, and
   the international environmental epidemiology literature. Using an rt
   priori set of the preliminary health-based criteria, we selected nine
   pollutants for risk assessment: total suspended particles (TSP), sulfur
   dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), ammonia arsenic,
   copper, cadmium, and lead. We used dose-response functions derived from
   epidemiologic studies to assess individual and population risks for TSP,
   SO2, NO2, As, Cd, and Pb. We assessed both cancer (for BaP, As, and Cd)
   and non-cancer (for all the chosen pollutants but BaP) responses, but in
   this paper we discuss only the assessments of noncarcinogenic risks due
   to TSP, SO2, NO2, ph, and Cd as examples of how the quantitative
   estimates of health effects can be produced by using a risk function
   approach. We also schematically present a modified conceptual model of
   multimedia-multipollutant risk assessment taking into account the
   experience gained with this study. Kg, words: industrial pollution,

Abstract = {{The elevated ground-level ozone concentrations are considered to be a
   risk factor for human health. In the Czech Republic the nation-wide
   ground-level ozone monitoring network was established in 1991 and at
   present it includes 60 monitoring sites representing rural, mountainous
   and town areas. This paper reports the results of data analysis of 30
   min mean concentrations for period of 1995-1998. Exposure index AOT60 is
   calculated for monitoring sites. Fields of cumulative exposure prepared
   using the geographical information system ARC/INFO and its module GRID
   are presented. The percentual share of population and area of the
   country exposed to elevated AOT60 values are presented for different
   years under review.
   For the period under review the highest ground-level ozone
   concentrations observed and exposures calculated are in 1995. The lowest
   concentrations and exposures are in 1997. The results reveal big
   differences among the years due to meteorological conditions. Distinct
   fact to be stressed is that even in the year with meteorological
   conditions extremely unfavourable for ozone formation (as 1997), the
   mean 8-h concentration of 60 ppb (WHO guideline value for ozone) is
   exceeded considerably.
   AOT60 values can be used as an indicator of ground-level ozone potential
   risk for human population. Other factors, nevertheless, are also to be
   taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Existing methods of establishing ambient air quality monitoring networks
   typically evaluate only parameters related to ambient concentrations of
   the contaminant(s) of interest such as emission source characteristics,
   atmospheric transport and dispersion, secondary reactions, deposition
   characteristics, and local topography. However, adverse health risks
   from exposures to airborne contaminants are a function of the
   contaminant and the anatomic and physiologic characteristics of the
   exposed population. Thus, ambient air quality monitoring networks
   designed for the protection of public health or for epidemiological
   studies evaluating adverse health impacts from exposures to ambient air
   contaminants should account for both contaminant characteristics and
   human health parameters. A methodology has been established which
   optimizes ambient air quality monitoring networks for assessments of
   adverse human health impacts from exposures to airborne contaminants by
   incorporating human health risk assessment techniques. The use of risk
   assessment techniques as the basis for designing ambient air quality
   monitoring networks will help to target limited financial and human
   resources to evaluate human health risks from exposures to airborne
   contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with birds, mammals, fish, and even amphibians, very little is
   known about the effects of contaminants on reptiles. Recent evidence
   that many reptile populations may be declining has stimulated demand for
   toxicological studies of reptiles as well as development of
   nondestructive sampling techniques useful for assessing and monitoring
   contaminant exposure. The current study experimentally evaluated the
   utility of shed skins, tail clips, and blood samples as nondestructive
   indices of trace element exposure in banded water snakes, Nerodia
   fasciata. For 13.5 months, snakes were either fed fish from a coal
   ash-contaminated site or uncontaminated food from a reference site.
   Snakes fed contaminated prey accumulated As, Cd, Se, Sr, and V in
   various organs (i.e. liver, kidney, and/or gonads). Moreover,
   non-parametric discriminant function analysis revealed that snakes could
   be placed in two groups that reliably reflected their experimental diet
   based upon Se, Sr, and As concentrations in tail clips, blood, and/or
   shed skins. We suggest that nondestructive sampling techniques,
   particularly analyses of blood and tail clips, may be easily applied in
   evaluations of contaminant exposure in the field and laboratory and may
   prevent excessive destructive sampling of potentially threatened reptile
   species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A population of the tortoise Testudo hermanii near Olympia in southern
   Greece was studied by mark-recapture from 1975 to 1984. Part of the site
   was sprayed with the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)
   and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) each year from 1980,
   producing symptoms of poisoning (swollen eyes, fluid discharge from the
   nose and immobility) in tortoises. Survival rates of tortoises 10 cm or
   larger were significantly lower in the affected areas, with extra
   mortality of about 34\% year(-1), against an annual survival rate of
   0.85-0.90 in unaffected areas. Changing population structures showed
   that juveniles were even more strongly affected, with the proportion of
   juveniles in samples decreased by half. The population in the sprayed
   area declined to near zero by 1984, due to mortality rather than to
   emigration, since more movements were recorded into than out of the
   affected area. There was no difference in body mass condition between
   sprayed and unsprayed areas, showing that effects were acute; mortality
   was not due to starvation from loss of food plants. The scale and
   pattern of mortality was similar to that from a severe scrub fire,
   spraying is potentially more catastrophic since often repeated at
   shorter intervals than burning. Possible physiological mechanisms of
   death are discussed. The susceptibility of tortoises to 2,4-D and
   2,4,5-T (or to associated dioxin impurities) presents a warning for
   conservation of these late-maturing animals. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In the present study morphological (ratio of body weight to body length,
   weight of internal organs) and haematological parameters (cells count,
   haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean
   corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration)
   were used for monitoring potential effects of metal contaminants on the
   Algerian mouse (Mus spretus). The study also provided the opportunity to
   evaluate the use of morphological and haematological characteristics as
   indicators of a metal stress. Data were taken from a riverside
   population inhabiting a heavy metal-contaminated site and compared with
   those collected from a reference population of the same species. With
   the exception of non-reproductive males, all mice weighed less in the
   metal-polluted site as compared to the reference site. Spleen and kidney
   masses were also less in contaminated mice but mean haemoglobin
   concentration was greater in the polluted group versus controls.
   Responses of mice from the polluted area mat indicate physiological
   stress due to diminished environmental quality. Results also suggest
   that M. spretus may be used as an indicator in pollution monitoring. (C)

Abstract = {{Sentinel species are biological monitors that accumulate a pollutant in
   their tissues without significant adverse effects. Primarily used to
   measure the amount of a pollutant that is biologically available, they
   may also increase the sensitivity of an analytical procedure or
   summarise a complex pollution signal. This payer examines the validation
   of sentinels, referring particularly to the use of invertebrates in
   monitoring toxic metal pollution in terrestrial ecosystems. Few studies
   measure the capacity of a sentinel to quantify changes in ambient
   levels. Definitions of `bioavailability' also differ between workers and
   few note that this: may be a highly species-specific measure. Validation
   requires that the temporal and spatial scales over which a sentinel
   integrates a pollution signal are known. The sentinel has to be
   calibrated against source concentrations and this relationship shown to
   be consistent over the normal range of exposure. This requires some
   consideration of the environmental and biological determinants of
   pollutant assimilation. Differences between populations can confound
   simple comparisons between sites based on native populations.
   Transplanted individuals, matched for age, sex and physiological state,
   might be used when the aim is not to assess bioavailability to the
   resident population. A simple measure of their capacity to detect
   differences in ambient pollutant levels is proposed to evaluate
   candidate species, to assess their consistency and capacity to
   equilibrate with their source. A small survey of earthworms from a
   well-defined gradient of Pb pollution is used to illustrate problems of
   interpreting tissue concentrations in sentinels. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Better understanding of the functions and abilities underlying some
   neurobehavioral tests would assist the assessment of the consequences to
   the health or well-being of exposed populations for which decrements in
   such tests have been found. Eye movements, which can be useful in
   evaluating specific theories of visual and cognitive processes, were
   measured while a single participant completed the NES Symbol-Digit
   Substitution test. Relationships between the durations and the
   frequencies of eye fixations within different parts of the test material
   and overall test performance were examined. The overall pattern of
   eye-movement behavior observed was as predicted: fixations within three
   regions of visual interest were made, usually in the order lower matrix,
   upper matrix, keyboard, Both the upper matrix fixation latency and the
   number of regional fixations made per item were found to be strongly
   associated with overall item response latency. This suggests that speed
   and efficiency of searching and the ability to maintain concentration
   appeared to be key attributes related to test performance for this
   participant. For suitable tests, eye-movement data may be useful for
   assessing and measuring the latencies of subtask components in a real
   test situation. Monitoring eye movement represents an alternative
   methodology to using sub test composites, or factor analysis, as a means
   of tapping into the functions underlying neurobehavioral test
   performance. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Dioxin and PCB monitoring programs for food and feeding stuff in most
   countries of the world, including many European Countries are currently
   inadequate. Better control of food production lines and food processing
   procedures is needed to minimize entry of dioxin to the food chain and
   will help to avoid dioxin contamination accidents. This would also
   improve the ability to trace back a possible contamination to its
   source. European guidelines for monitoring programs should be
   established to ensure comparable and meaningful results. These
   guidelines should define the minimum requirements for the design of
   monitoring programs, analytical methods, and quality assurance.
   Though data from Northern Europe shows that the general population
   exposure to dioxin and PCB has decreased during the last ten years these
   compounds continue to be a risk of accidental contamination of the food
   chain. The most prominent recent example is the Belgian dioxin
   contamination of feeding stuff in 1999. The Belgian dioxin contamination
   was not detected due to dioxin monitoring programs but by their direct
   biological effects seen in animals. Four other cases of dioxin
   contamination have been detected in Europe since 1997 due to local
   monitoring programs. One of them (citrus pulp pellets 1998) was in a
   much larger scale than the Belgian dioxin contamination.
   The general population's exposure to dioxins and PCBs is still in the
   same range (1-4 pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight and day) as the recently
   revised WHO tolerable daily intake (TDI). There is concern that
   short-term high level exposure to dioxins, furans, and PCB may cause
   biological effects on the human fetal development and further research
   is required.
   Further actions to control sources building on considerable advances
   already made in many countries may need to be supplemented by measures
   to prevent direct contamination of feeding stuff or food to reduce
   general population exposure further.}},

Title = {{Evaluating faba beans for rust resistance using detached leaves}},
Journal = {{EUPHYTICA}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-57}},
Abstract = {{A method was developed for testing detached leaves of faba beans for
   their response to rust disease. Leaves 5 to 8, counting from the shoot
   tip, were excised and maintained on a water-retaining medium, with 5 ppm
   gibberellic acid, in an enclosed box in a temperature-controlled
   glasshouse. Leaves treated in this way remained in good health for up to
   30 days. Rust spores were dispersed in a slurry of talc and water and
   applied to the abaxial leaf surface. Disease development of seven rust
   populations, collected from several locations in eastern Australia, was
   monitored for 15 days on eight faba bean accessions. Four accessions
   were BPL lines which ICARDA claimed to have some resistance, two were
   ILB lines from ICARDA which had been found to have stronger field
   resistance in northern New South Wales, Australia, and the remaining two
   were known susceptibles. The detached-leaf test showed that the two
   cultivars were susceptible, the four BPL lines were intermediate and ILB
   3107 and ILB 3025 were slow-rusting. One rust population, which had been
   stored under liquid nitrogen for several years, was less effective at
   inducing disease symptoms than the other six, which were all freshly
   collected. The interactions between host accessions and rust populations
   were statistically significant but minor, as the cultivars remained in
   their categories of resistance or susceptibility. The detached-leaf
   technique is thus suitable for use in screening individual plants for
   reaction to several different pathogen species or genotypes without
   danger of cross-contamination or induced resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The activity and number of protocerebral neurosecretory neurons of the
   dorsolateral group (L1, L2 and L2'), as well as the size of the corpora
   allata were investigated in 5th instar larvae of the gypsy moth
   (Lymantria dispar) from two populations (oak and locust-tree forests)
   fed one of two host-plants (oak is a suitable and locust-tree an
   unsuitable host-plant).
   The monitoring of activity related cytological parameters and the number
   of protocerebral dorsolateral neurosecretory neurons revealed that
   differently adapted populations respond to nutritive stress differently.
   The activity of the L1 neurosecretory neurons in the protocerebra of the
   caterpillars is low in those from the locust-tree forest regardless of
   host-plant quality. The L2 neurosecretory neurons in the oak population
   become active when they were fed the unsuitable host-plant whereas their
   activity was high in locust-tree caterpillars regardless of the
   host-plant. A decrease in the number of neurosecretory neurons in a
   response to a novel food was noticed in both populations. The activity
   of the L2' neurosecretory neurons was similar in all caterpillars, but
   their number was increased in those from the locust-tree forest. The
   corpora allata of the locust-tree caterpillars were large whereas those
   of the oak forest caterpillars only increased in size when they were fed
   locust-tree leaves.
   It is obvious that nutritive stress results in neurosecretory
   reorganization and changes in the titre of hormones that modulate the
   morphogenetic programme.}},

Abstract = {{Aspects of sexual selection were studied in a sexually monomorphic
   Australian agamid lizard (Ctenophorus fordi), in particular with respect
   to the sensory exploitation hypothesis. In enclosure trials, females
   were offered the choice between `large' vs. `small' males and, in a
   different experiment, males with `blue' vs. `normal' head color. The
   rationale for these experiments was: firstly, to establish if females
   actively solicit copulations; secondly, if so, do females solicit
   copulations non-randomly with respect to male size (because large males
   may have access to food resources); thirdly, if male coloration is
   manipulated to match traits of congeneric, conspicuous and sexually
   dimorphic species, do females show preference for this novel trait (in
   accordance with the sensory exploitation hypothesis). The corresponding
   manipulations were also made in a free-living population where the
   distribution of females on the home ranges of color-manipulated males
   were monitored. Blue-headed males were accepted as mating partners both
   in the staged mating trials and in the natural population. Females
   appeared not to express any kind of active or passive mate choice
   (rejection); in only one out of 62 trials did a female approach a male
   herself rather than being approached by the male(s). There was no
   discrimination against any male category regardless of size or color
   within a female's receptive period and the manipulation of male head
   color in the natural population did not result in spatial
   re-distribution of females. Thus, a female appears to mate unselectively
   within her receptive period. Rejection behaviors were used only outside
   of the receptive period to communicate, to all males, that the female is
   not receptive.}},

Abstract = {{From 1995 to 1999, four experiments were conducted on greenhouse roses
   to assess the effectiveness of the nC24 petroleum spray oil (PSO),
   D-C-Tron Plus, against two-spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch
   (Acarina: Tetranychidae), and to determine how the oil could be most
   efficiently and effectively used in combination with the predatory mite
   Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot (Acarina: Phytoseiidae) in an
   integrated pest management program. The results showed that 0.5\% PSO
   applied fortnightly to roses gave excellent protection from T. urticae
   infestation when the mite population was not already established.
   However, PSO applied after roses were infested with T. urticae above the
   economic threshold only stabilised populations without reducing them
   below that threshold. Populations of P. persimilis in the upper and
   lower canopies were unchanged after two sprays of PSO at 7-day
   intervals, and application of PSO to the upper canopy was as effective
   in controlling T. urticae in the presence of P. persimilis as spraying
   the entire plant. Combining PSO with P. persimilis gave better control
   of T. urticae than using P. persimilis alone. The most cost-effective
   use of PSO in the presence of P. persimilis is, therefore, to apply
   spray only to the upper canopy. This will not affect control of powdery
   mildew with PSO. Comparison of a control program for T. urticae based on
   the monitored use of synthetic miticides with that based on calendar
   application of PSO revealed that both gave equally effective control.
   The benefits of combining PSO and P. persimilis in an integrated pest
   management program for T. urticae on roses over a program based on
   synthetic fungicides are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal behaviors of phytoseiid and tetranychid mites are key factors
   in understanding predator-prey dynamics and biological control of pest
   mites at different spatial levels in agricultural and natural
   ecosystems. In this review, ambulatory and aerial dispersal of both mite
   groups are discussed at spatial levels of leaf, plant, crop and region.
   Emphasis is on dispersal of phytoseiids, and specifically, the
   specialist-predator, Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman), and two-spotted
   spider mite prey, Tetranychus urticae (Koch). Dispersal aspects that are
   discussed are ambulation on a leaf; plant or in a prey patch; aerial
   dispersal between plants; behavior and aerodynamics of aerial take-off;
   modeling vs. monitoring of dispersal distance; fates of dispersing mites
   that land on soil substrates; plants as take-off platforms and landing
   targets for dispersers; and regional dispersal patterns and integrated
   mite management.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to identify possible causes for the
   altitudinal limitation of a plant species with montane distribution,
   i.e. Meum athamanticum. The response of its growth to altitude was
   measured along an elevational gradient from 170 m to 1130 m a.s.l. in
   the Hart Mountains, Germany. Naturally occurring Meum plants and
   different age classes that had been transplanted to 7 sites along this
   gradient were monitored for several growth parameters. The growth rates
   differed only slightly among altitudes, a sign of a low phenotypical
   plasticity The germination requirements were analyzed in growth chambers
   using different pre-treatments and temperatures. The seeds had a
   secondary dormancy that was effectively broken by a pre-treatment of
   alternating temperatures; whereas the temperature at germination time
   exerted almost no effect on germination rates. No specific requirements
   related to montane climate were detected. The plant's frost tolerance
   directly after sprouting in spring was examined in freeze chamber
   experiments. Since significant frost damage detected by electrolyte
   leakage was observed only at -9 degrees C or below, frost sensitivity
   was excluded as a cause for the altitudinal distribution limit. The
   acclimation of net photosynthesis was measured by comparing the
   temperature optimum of autochthonous individuals and transplants. The
   optima differed only by 0.5 K between plants grown at 170 m or 600 m
   a.s.l. which indicates a low adaptive capability. The reduction of
   starch concentration as the main storage carbohydrate in Meum roots was
   monitored in natural populations and in transplants. The loss of starch
   during the winter was substantial at all sites but was highest at the
   lowest elevation.
   The general conclusion from our study is that Meum athamanticum is
   restricted to montane sites because its low phenotypical plasticity does
   not allow the exploitation of more favourable climatic conditions in the
   lowlands. In addition, the ability of Meum plants to thrive at higher
   temperatures is probably reduced by the carbon loss in winter.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1974 and 1992 there were declines in bramble (Rubus fruticosus
   agg.) and several woodland forbs and an increase in grasses at Wytham
   Woods. These changes have been explained as effects of increasing deer
   populations. We set out to test this by establishing exclosure
   experiments in the summer of 1997. Comparison of permanent vegetation
   monitoring plots inside and outside the exclosures, showed that forbs
   tended to increase inside exclosures whilst decreasing in the wider
   wood, supporting the hypothesis that deer herbivory was responsible for
   the change. Changes in individual species were not, however, significant
   and it may take many years for the vegetation in the exclosures to reach
   a new equilibrium. In contrast to exclosures under the woodland canopy,
   additional exclosures in a clearing have been rapidly colonized by
   bramble. It appears there is an interaction between solar radiation and
   herbivory and the decline of bramble at Wytham may reflect canopy
   closure as well as deer herbivory. Faecal pellet counts made in
   Environmental Change Network monitoring plots between August 1998 and
   April 1999 indicated different habitat use by fallow (Dama dama) and
   muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) deer. Grasslands in proximity to the
   woodland tended to accumulate proportionally more fallow deer faeces,
   whilst dense ancient woodland areas tended to accumulate more muntjac
   faeces. There was, however, little evidence of an association between
   particular species of plant and differential habitat use by deer.}},

Abstract = {{We have tested microsatellite analysis to monitor within-stand genetic
   diversity in seedlot samples from pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). We
   focused on two key criteria of within-stand diversity: the number of
   seed parents (mother trees) included in the seed harvests, and the
   number of pollen donors (father trees) contributing to the open
   pollinated families. Our results show that nuclear microsatellite loci
   are suitable to detect seed contaminations and to infer the genotypes of
   the seed parents directly from genotype data of extremely small
   anonymous acorn samples (five to eight acorns per mother tree), given
   that the samples from each putative mother tree have been supplied
   separately. Subsequently, the number of different mother trees for such
   anonymous seedlot samples can be inferred by comparing the reconstructed
   maternal genotypes and by calculating F-ST pairwise between the
   families. Furthermore, we have tested an approach to infer the number of
   different pollen donors directly from open pollinated families by
   analysing haplotype arrays of closely linked microsatellite markers
   transmitted from the fathers to the progeny. We selected three closely
   linked microsatellites from a previously constructed genetic map of
   Quercus robur, then we used simulated data of these linked markers
   segregating in open pollinated families to test the approach in detail.
   The procedures presented here are designed for small sample sizes and
   for situations where no genotype information is available for the parent
   population. Therefore they are potentially useful for monitoring
   commercial seedlot samples from Quercus robur.}},

   mammalian populations counteract anthropogenically-accelerated landscape
   evolution in the tidal freshwater zone are identified. Mapping and
   monitoring of vegetation, animal activity, substrate conditions, delta
   geomorphology, and sedimentation rates were carried out April 1995 to
   November 1997 in the Otter Point Creek tidal freshwater zone of Bush
   River in Maryland. Animal activities that were observed include plant
   uprooting, soil surface mixing, channelization, dam building, and lodge
   building by beavers and muskrats. These activities decreased soil
   surface elevation, increased daily flooding depth and duration, and
   locally redistributed sediment. Time series of net sedimentation show
   that animal-impacted sites exhibit unique local sedimentation pulses and
   erosional phases that are distinguishable from non-impacted sites within
   the same habitat type. The primary consequence of animal activity was a
   reverse succession of plant associations and a predictable change in
   related geomorphic site variables. Even though changes are localized,
   aerial photos show large interdistributary regions that are two or more
   steps behind in plant succession relative to surrounding areas, and
   these lagging sites are likely the result of historic animal activity.
   Thus, even though animals cannot stop human-accelerated river evolution,
   they can change the distribution of habitats and. rates of vertical
   accretion across a delta.}},

Abstract = {{This evaluation shows that the (technical) potential contribution of
   bio-energy to the future world's energy supply could be very large. In
   theory, energy farming on current agricultural land could contribute
   over 800 EJ, without jeopardising the world's food supply. Use of
   degraded lands may add another (maximum) 150 EJ, although this
   contribution will largely come from crops with a low productivity. The
   growing demand for bio-materials may require a biomass input equivalent
   to 20-50 EJ, which must be grown on plantations when existing forests
   are not able to supply this growing demand. Organic wastes and residues
   could possibly supply another 40-170 EJ, with uncertain contributions
   from forest residues and potentially a very significant role for organic
   waste, especially when bio-materials are used on a larger scale. In
   total, the upper limit of the bio-energy potential could be over 1000 EJ
   (per year). This is considerably more than the current global energy use
   of 400 EJ. However, this contribution is by no means guaranteed: crucial
   factors determining biomass availability for energy are: 1. Population
   growth and economic development. 2. The efficiency and productivity of
   food production systems that must be adopted world wide and the rate of
   their deployment in particular in developing countries. 3. Feasibility
   of the use of marginal/degraded lands. 4. Productivity of forests and
   sustainable harvest levels. 5. The (increased) utilisation of
   bio-materials. So, major transitions are required to exploit this
   bio-energy potential. It is uncertain to what extent such transitions
   are feasible. Depending on the factors mentioned above, the bio-energy
   potential could be very low as well. Furthermore, in order to qualify as
   a sustainable energy option, stringent (sustainability) criteria should
   be met. Those criteria have ecological, economic and social dimensions
   and impacts will differ widely depending strongly on local conditions.
   Although it offers major possibilities, international bioenergy trade
   should be treated with care and carefully monitored.}},

Abstract = {{On the last meeting of the group Sept. 1996 at Braunschweig (Germany) a
   ``Monitoring scheme for investigating suspected pesticide poisoning of
   honey-bees{''} was presented. The scheme is listing the different steps
   of the performance of assessment, investigation and report of poisoning
   incidents. The different steps are linked with each other in a logical
   sequence. A very important part of the scheme is the filling of a
   detailed questionnaire. As it is supposed, that normally no official
   person is present, when a poisoning incident happens or when it is
   noticed first, the informations of the questionnaire will be the basis
   for all decisions, actions and investigations to be done later.
   Therefore the informations given normally by the beekeeper must be as
   detailed and precise as possible. The presented ``Field inquiry into
   suspected poisoning incidents involving honeybees{''} is basing in
   corresponding questionnaires from Great Britain (identical title), the
   Netherlands (title: Form for reporting spraying incidents - to use when
   honeybees are presumably killed as consequence of exposure to plant
   protection products) and Germany (title: Application form for
   investigation of poisoning incidents of honeybee populations). The
   questionnaire is containing a lot of questions, which may enable the
   investigators, to form an impression about the circumstances of the
   causes of the poisoning incident, without having seen the local
   conditions. Moreover the detailed questions respectively their precise
   answers should make the detection of the causes of the incidents for the
   investigators easier and faster. Otherwise when no or vague informations
   are given the investigations are like a search for a needle in a
   haycock. A missing or vague answering of the questions also makes the
   investigations much more expensive.
   Finally the answers of the questionnaire could be part of legal
   conflicts between farmer and beekeepers, when the beekeeper is demanding
   a compensation for the loss of his populations. A complete and precise
   answering may help all involved persons (policemen, judges, lawyers) who
   are mostly inexperienced in beekeeping and plant protection, to give
   them a better understanding of the situation.}},

Abstract = {{Episodic switching between Tropodiaptomus spectabilis and Metadiaptomus
   meridianus in L. Midmar (29 degrees 30' S, 30 degrees 12' E), and
   transitory seasonal alternation of these taxa in L. Albert Falls (29
   degrees 26' S, 30 degrees 26' E) recorded in comparative studies of
   these inter-leading reservoirs between 1989 and 1999, along with
   historical records for Midmar extending back to 1978, are updated and
   re-evaluated in light of subsequent and additional findings. In the
   longer term, an `exclusive' occupancy by one or another species has been
   maintained in these and other inter-leading impoundments on the
   quasi-subtropical Mgeni River. Sympatry was invariably transitional. It
   lasted several months in the upper Midmar system, and where protracted
   over several years as in the downstream Albert Falls system, was
   effectively negated by seasonal separation of the taxa. Possible
   influences of parasitism, changes in water turbidity or pH, dependent or
   independent of inter-basin water transfers, and such water transfers
   themselves, are explored and rejected as proximate causes of species
   replacement. Because evidence for the existence of resting eggs was
   contradictory (respectively present and absent in preserved and live
   samples), emergence from diapause is considered an unlikely source of
   re-colonisation. The guild complement of invertebrate planktivores is
   comparable in both lakes, seemingly removing predation as a determinant
   factor. The comparability of food thresholds for various measures of
   demographic performance suggests remarkable similarity in the
   competitive potential of these species, which additionally show
   considerable niche overlap in terms of adult diet, and comparable
   vulnerability to ellobiopsid parasitism. Ecological separation is thus
   limited to differentiation of thermal optima, functional feeding biology
   of juvenile stages - especially nauplii, and sediment tolerance.
   Evidence now available supports previous arguments that species
   separations remain attributable largely to marginal species differences
   in thermal optima, mirrored in the pattern of seasonal separation during
   an episode of sympatry (1990 to early 1994) in the down-stream Albert
   Falls system. While no causal explanation can be substantiated from
   evidence gleaned during this decade of study, the species replacements
   observed in Midmar appear to reflect alternative stable states, induced
   by presently unknown factor(s), plausibly temperature, or improbably,
   human translocation. By contrast, alternative stable states are not
   manifest in Albert Falls, wherein the longer term, T. spectabilis
   seemingly represents the only stable state, a feature apparently shared
   by other warmer reservoirs down the Mgeni cascade. The unpredictability
   of chaotic dynamics precludes its analysis in this situation, while
   conversely, the system provides a unique model for meta-population
   analysis, related to uni-directionality of natural dispersal. However,
   the cost-effectiveness of continued monitoring for unforeseeable events
   poses a serious practical dilemma.}},

Abstract = {{The population size of the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, was
   monitored annually in the summers of 1991-1997 by examining six species
   of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) caught by surface long-lines in
   oceanic offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. The
   annual copepod population size on all salmonids caught was estimated by
   combining the calculated number of copepods carrying on each salmonid
   species. The copepod population fluctuated markedly from year to year,
   which resulted largely from marked annual changes in abundance of pink
   salmon (O. gorbuscha). Since pink salmon were most frequently and
   heavily infected and since their abundance changed every year, the
   copepod population was high in the years when this salmonid species was
   abundant, but low when it was rare. On the contrary, chum salmon (O.
   keta) did not show high prevalence and intensity of infection, but the
   annual abundance of this host species was consistently high, i.e. chum
   salmon carried many copepods every year. Copepods on other salmonid
   species (sockeye salmon O. nerka, coho salmon O. kisutch, chinook salmon
   O. tshawytscha, and steelhead trout O. mykiss) constantly formed a small
   percentage of the total copepod population. Both chum and pink salmon
   are the most important hosts in terms of their substantial contribution
   to support the copepod population, but the importance as hosts of each
   species is definitely different between the species. Chum salmon is a
   stable important host supporting the copepod population at a relatively
   high level every year, while the number of copepods on pink salmon
   annually exhibits marked fluctuations, and this salmonid species is
   regarded as an unstable important host.}},

   The prevalence and magnitude of natural infections observed were
   comparable to those reported elsewhere. In most rivers, older fish seem
   to be less susceptible than 0+ fish, possibly due to an acquired
   immunity resulting from previous exposures. Initial infection loads may
   be greater on older fish due to greater ventilation rates and/or gill
   surface areas. However, this host size effect appears to be transitory.
   In a stock of farmed 0+ salmon, an entire parasitic stage was monitored.
   This took up to 11 months and only 5-10\% of the initially attached
   glochidia managed to metamorphose and excyst as juvenile mussels. There
   are apparent differences in host utilisation between salmon and trout in
   certain rivers. Some trout stocks appear to be under-utilised by M.
   margaritifera, possibly due to differences in behaviour and/or spawning
   site. 0+ salmon are the most important hosts in several rivers. However,
   there are a number of mussel populations located in small streams which
   have no salmon, and these are entirely trout-dependent. This may be
   important in terms of conservation, with regard to the recent collapse
   of migratory trout stocks in Scotland.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fulfil the requirements for agricultural, domestic and
   industrial purposes, the dependency on groundwater in Punjab-Haryana
   plains is rapidly increasing. Agriculture is the main source of
   livelihood of the rural population and the heavy dependence on
   groundwater is evident in that groundwater is used for irrigation in
   95\% of the total irrigated area. Several questions which the planners
   and decision makers are confronted with relate to the quantity and
   quality of groundwater and how the groundwater resource is affected by
   the location of recharge areas, the temporal and spatial variability of
   recharge, the inter-linkage between groundwater and surface water,
   existing hydraulic gradients, and the water table situation, and
   regional groundwater flow. Major groundwater resource problems result
   from indiscriminate exploitation, particularly for irrigation, and
   contaminant inputs from a variety of sources such as urban runoff,
   fertilisers used in agriculture, seepage from contaminated industrial
   sites, and industrial discharges. Improved water availability and safe
   water supply can be guided by effective public policies, plans, and
   local technologies, in addition to political, socio-economic, and other
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{In situ bioremediation of oil-contaminated soils by means of bioventing
   is seen as a cost effective technology for remediation of oil
   contaminated sites. Laboratory microcosms containing a long-term heavy
   oil contaminated soil were treated as a bioventing simulation system,
   applying different system parameters (i.e., the amendment of different
   nutrient compositions: mineral nutrients and a commercial oleophylic
   nutrient) with or without oxygen. In addition, in some microcosms extra
   diesel fuel was added in order to examine the influence of the oil
   concentration on the developing microbial populations. The changes in
   microbial populations were followed by means of Denaturing Gradient Gel
   Electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA fragments generated by PCR using
   general eubacterial primers, and by CFU counts after microbial
   extraction. Analysis of the hydrocarbon content was performed to
   investigate the biodegradation capacity. Bacteria capable of using high
   oil concentrations as a C-source, were isolated and characterised for
   their hydrocarbon utilization pattern. Based on the clustered DGGE
   patterns, the CFU counts, and the hydrocarbon content, an effect on the
   microbial oil degrading soil population could be observed for those soil
   samples to which nutrients were added. Aeration did not seem to make any
   difference.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas fluorescens HK44 is a bioluminescent bioreporter that emits
   visible light when degrading naphthalene and other polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs). This strain harbors the bioluminescent reporter
   plasmid pUTK21 which contains a nahG-luxCDABE gene fusion in a
   salicylate inducible operon. In October of 1996, P. fluorescens HK44 was
   introduced into semi-contained subsurface soil lysimeter structures in
   the first EPA approved environmental release of a genetically engineered
   microorganism (GEM) for bioremediation purposes. The study was performed
   to determine if GEMs could be successfully introduced and maintained
   during a long-term soil bioremediation process and to show that
   bioluminescent light emission could be utilized as an in situ tool for
   on-line bioremediation process monitoring and control. HK44 population
   dynamics were tracked using standard plate count procedures while light
   emissions were measured using instrumentation consisting of fiber optic
   guides, novel on-line biosensors, and a portable photomultiplier tube.
   The largest portion of the field release occurred over an approximate
   two-year period, during which it was shown that hydrocarbon
   contamination could be correlated with bioluminescence throughout the
   bioremediation process, illustrating that bioreporter organisms were
   capable of providing, in real-time, a general assessment of
   bioremediation effectiveness. Longer term analysis of P. fluorescens
   HK44 population activities during the third year after release (up to
   1150 days after initial release) indicated that HK44 cells were still
   active and could be induced to bioluminesce upon exposure to
   naphthalene.}},

Abstract = {{Field in Finland to develop a monitoring and prediction trials were
   conducted from 1989 to 1993 method using pheromone traps for European
   pine sawfly (Neadiprion sertifer Geoffr.) population densities and
   needle defoliation. Three traps per site were baited with 100 mug
   of(2S,3S,7S) - 3,7 - dimethyl - 2 - pentadecyl acetate (diprionyl) at
   sites representing advanced pine stands. The number of overwintering
   eggs per sample branch was used to evaluate the effectiveness of using
   pheromone traps to estimate sawfly populations. The relationships
   between the number of males in traps, the number of eggs per branch in
   the subsequent generation, and the number of needle-year classes after
   the subsequent growing season were highly correlated. The risk threshold
   for moderate to heavy defoliation was around 1,000 males/trap. Our
   results suggest that after some minor improvements, a pheromone-based
   monitoring system for the European pine sawfly would provide an
   effective tool for integrated pest management programs and successful
   forest management in coniferous pine-dominated forests.}},

Abstract = {{The western blackheaded budworm (Acleris gloverana (Walshingham)) is a
   cyclic defoliator of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.).
   At least seven blackheaded budworm outbreaks have occurred in British
   Columbia and severe defoliation has been recorded during five of these
   outbreaks on Vancouver Island. Spatial patterns of past blackheaded
   budworm outbreaks on the Island were examined by overlaying them with
   biogeoclimatic units, elevation, and climate data to identify and rate
   stands susceptible to outbreaks. Three variants of the Coastal Western
   Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone, in decreasing order of susceptibility, were
   CWHvm1, CWHvm2, and CWHvh1. In addition, small areas of the Mountain
   Hemlock zone (MHmm1) were also defoliated. Only a small area on the
   northern tip of Vancouver Island was defoliated during three of the four
   outbreaks. Based on these results, we recommend locating permanent
   sentinel pheromone monitoring traps in the repeatedly defoliated area on
   northern Vancouver Island. We also recommend conducting additional
   larval sampling in the CWHvm1, CWHvm2, and CWHvh1 biogeoclimatic units
   to confirm rising pest populations based on pheromone trap catches so
   that control options may be examined prior to serious damage to the
   stands.}},

Abstract = {{It is now possible to carry out Monte Carlo uncertainty studies with
   large photochemical grid models such as UAM-IV. The current study uses
   information on the effects of uncertainties in 109 input variables on
   UAM-IV model predictions of maximum daily one-hour averaged ozone
   concentrations at 29 monitoring sites in the New York City UAM domain
   for the 8 July 1988 ozone episode. Fifty Monte Carlo runs were made with
   the UAM-IV model making use of simple random sampling from assumed
   distributions for each input variable. The resulting sets of 50
   predicted values of ozone concentration allowed Cumulative Distribution
   Functions (CDFs) to be determined for each site. These CDFs were
   typically log-normal with a standard deviation of about +/-10\% or
   +/-20\%. Note that these uncertainties are due only to uncertainties in
   input variables and do not include contributions due to errors in model
   physics or stochastic fluctuations. The Lewellen-Sykes-Parker (LSP)
   model evaluation methodology has been applied to the predictions of
   maximum daily one-hour averaged ozone concentrations at the 29
   monitoring sites using, the CDFs from the Monte Carlo study. The
   assumption is tested that the model prediction is correct, in the sense
   that the observations are not significantly different from the
   predictions. The hypothesis is tested that the Monte Carlo CDFs of
   predicted concentrations represent a set of 50 realizations from the
   population of observed concentrations. Therefore the Monte Carlo results
   were used to generate many possible realizations of CDFs of model
   residuals, i.e. observed minus predicted concentration, which were then
   compared with the actual CDF of model residuals at the 29 sites. It was
   found, as expected, that the single actual CDF line for the model
   residuals covered a slightly broader range (a standard deviation of
   about 20\% compared to about 10\%) than the 95\% confidence intervals
   for the CDFs from the 50 Monte Carlo runs.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to describe trends in ambient air
   quality in Tehran between 1988 and 1993, to determine if these levels
   exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, and to discuss
   possible health effects related to exposure for these particular
   pollutants. Data were acquired from Iran's Environmental Protection
   Agency (IEPA) and the Ministry of Health (MH). These agencies operate
   five automated ambient air monitoring stations located in areas with
   heavy traffic. Daily samples of SO2, NO2, CO, total suspended
   particulate matter (TSM), and hydrocarbons (HC) were collected to
   provide 24 hour averages for each pollutant. Every three months, mean
   concentrations were reported to IEPA. Composite samples from all five
   stations were stored in a databank operated by IEPA. The ambient air
   quality guidelines were obtained from WHO reports. Statistical analysis
   was carried out using a regression model, which was designed to fit the
   air pollution data and take into account missing data. The results
   showed that there was a statistically significant upward trend in air
   pollution levels for all of the measured pollutants, except NO2, during
   the, years 1988 to 1993. WHO guidelines were routinely and substantially
   exceeded by all pollutants except TSM. These findings suggest that as
   the population continues to grow, and increasing numbers of motor
   vehicles are driven in Tehran, there is concern for the health effects
   that may result from exposure to these pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{1. We report a field experiment designed to explore the responses by
   hedgehogs to novel and unfavourable terrain, which they encounter when
   dispersing between fragmented local populations in farmland. We
   identified four replicate sites as unused by hedgehogs, but lying
   between existing populations and containing locally abundant food. At
   each site, we released six hedgehogs from distant sources at 2-day
   intervals and monitored their subsequent dispersals over 20 days by
   radio-tracking. We compared movement trajectories under this treatment
   to those of 29 hedgehogs released at two sites known to support abundant
   hedgehogs. A third treatment comprised 20 unmanipulated hedgehogs at
   three sites. We estimated habitat use and proximity to habitats by
   comparing each observed trajectory to simulated random walks of equal
   length. We sought differences between treatments in movement and habitat
   use from nested analysis of variance.
   2, No two trajectories of any translocated hedgehogs followed the same
   route; most involved little change in body weight, and took the animal
   into or through existing populations. Hedgehogs moved substantially
   further and faster on average from the unfavourable than from the
   favourable sites. They showed a significantly stronger attraction to
   habitat edges, which therefore acted as corridors, and a significant
   proportion of them stayed closer to roads and to urban habitat than
   random expectation. Habitat preferences also shifted significantly
   towards urban and away from arable areas. Six were predated, and two
   killed by road traffic. At least three returned to their release point,
   with P < 0.05 of this occurring by chance.
   3, In this region, natural dispersals between populations up to 4 km
   apart are rare events. We have shown, however, that hedgehogs are
   capable of travelling distances of up to 3.8 km from a release point,
   and up to 9.9 km in total, compared to an average home range span of 0.8
   km, and it appears that none of the local populations in the study area
   are out of reach of neighbours.}},

Abstract = {{1. The timing of prey exploitation by oystercatcher Haematopus
   ostralegus L, was predicted from detailed knowledge of the
   characteristics of its prey, the clam Scrobicularia plana da Costa.
   2, Growth, mortality and depth distribution of a single cohort of
   Scrobicularia were monitored on a tidal flat in the Dutch Wadden Sea
   during a period of 7 years.
   3. A random search model predicted for every sampling date the encounter
   rate with buried clams providing oystercatchers vary the depth at which
   they probe their bill into the substrate. The time needed to handle
   encountered prey was estimated from experimentally determined
   relationships of handling time with clam size and handling time with
   burying depth. Encounter rate, handling time and body weight of the
   potential prey items were used in an optimal prey choice model to
   predict the average intake rate of an oystercatcher as a function of
   probing depth.
   4, The predicted intake rate reached a profitable level only during
   three restricted periods. During the first period, a relatively high
   intake rate could only be achieved by probing extremely deeply, and the
   mortality rate of the clams remained at a low level. During the other
   two periods, maximal intake rate was reached by probing only the upper
   few cm of the substrate, and this time there was a high mortality in the
   prey population.
   5. Although the observed peaks in clam mortality coincided with the
   predicted exploitation periods, they could not be explained fully by the
   estimated predation pressure.
   6. Prey switching was predicted and confirmed during several
   exploitation periods.
   7. Oystercatcher densities during winter peaks in bird abundance showed
   a tight relationship with predicted maximum intake rates.}},

Abstract = {{Myxas glutinosa was found in 4 lakes out of a total of 51 visited on the
   Aland Islands, Finland. The lakes are eutrophic with high values for
   water chemistry parameters and are rich in aquatic vegetation. A
   population of M. glutinosa in one of the lakes (Lake Bolstaholm) was
   monitored over two seasons. In spying, individuals live on rocks where
   they feed on epilithic algae and propagate, then die. In late summer the
   new generation hatches and is mainly found on leaves of water lilies.
   During this time they grow, feeding either on epiphytic algae or on
   decaying leaves. In late autumn, having reached their adult size, they
   descend to deeper water to hibernate.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations in human placenta of 11 essential elements (P, Ca, Mg,
   Cu, S, Na, Fe, Zn, K, Se, Mn) and 5 toxic elements (Ba, Sr, Pb, Ni, Cd)
   are compared for each of two arctic communities in eastern Norway and
   western Russia, and for another in each country located at more
   southerly latitudes. All but Mg, Fe, P and K were present in higher
   concentrations in the Russian study group. The observed inter-element
   correlations are reflected by the four major factors identified in a
   principal component analysis. The total variation explained was 67.3\%,
   of which more than half (35.3\%) was contributed by Factor 1. P, Ca, Mg,
   Ba, Sr, Pb, and Ni were major contributors to this factor. The placental
   concentrations of these elements depended strongly on gestational age,
   increasing from about week 35 and peaking near weeks 39 and 40, and
   exhibited skewed frequency distributions and a dependence on maternal
   smoking. The gestational-dependent mineralization of the placenta is
   interpreted to reflect the deposition of metal phosphates coinciding
   with smoking-induced tissue damage. The loadings of the remaining three
   factors are reviewed in the context of common uptake mechanisms, similar
   biochemistries and unique transport pathways. The inter-element
   relationships and grouping of the elements observed should constitute a
   scientific base for the use of placenta composition in environmental
   monitoring and epidemiological studies.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the question of whether short-term studies can be
   used to forecast the accumulation of the long-lived fission product
   Tc-99 in duckweed, Lemna minor L., grown in the field, in other words,
   are the accumulation parameters independent of changing growth rates
   typical of natural populations of duckweed. Two processes determine the
   99Tc accumulation: (i) uptake and release of (TcO4-)-Tc-99,
   characterised by a concentration factor, K-d, and (ii) first-order
   reduction and complexation of Tc-VII, characterised by k(red). At
   various Tc-99 concentrations, the growth, total Tc and TcO4-
   accumulation were monitored over 10 days; parameters were fitted and
   compared with earlier results. Both K-d and k(red) turn out to be
   independent of time, concentration and growth rate up to a concentration
   Of 10(-6) mol l(-1 99)TcO(4)(-). Concentrations above this level result
   in toxic effects. The Tc accumulation in field populations of duckweed
   at Tc concentrations which generally occur in the environment can be
   forecasted by using the results from short-term experiments. (C) 2001

Title = {{Remediation strategies for rural territories contaminated by the

Abstract = {{The objective of the present paper is to derive remediation strategies
   for rural settlements contaminated by the Chernobyl accident in which
   annual doses to a critical group still exceed 1 mSv. Extensive
   radioecological data have been collected for TO contaminated
   settlements. A dose model based on these data resulted in estimates that
   are on average close to and a bit less than the official dose estimates
   (catalogue doses') published by the responsible Ministries of Belarus,
   Russia and Ukraine. For eight remedial actions that call be applied on a
   large scale, effectiveness and costs have been assessed in light of
   their dependence on soil type, contamination level and on the degree of
   previous application of remedial actions. Remediation strategies were
   derived for each of the 70 settlements by choosing remedial actions with
   lowest costs per averted dose and with highest degree of acceptability
   among the farmers and local authorities until annual doses are assessed
   to fall below 1 mSv. The results were generalised to II
   contamination/internal-dose categories. The total numbers of rural
   inhabitants and privately owned cows in the three countries distributed
   over the categories were determined and predicted until the year 2015.
   Based on these data, costs and averted doses were derived for the whole
   affected population. The main results are (i) about 2000 Sv can be
   averted at relatively low costs, (ii) the emphasis on reducing external
   exposures should be increased, (iii) radical improvement of hay-land and
   meadows and application of Prussian blue to cows should be performed on
   a large scale if annual doses of 1 mSv are an aim to be achieved, (iv)
   additional remedial actions of importance are fertilising of potato
   fields, distribution of food monitors and restriction of mushroom
   consumption, and (v) for inhabitants of some settlements (in total about
   8600) annual doses cannot be reduced below 1 mSv by the remedial actions
   considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study to monitor the composting process, to evaluate the effec
   tiveness of bioindicators for the quality and maturity of cured compost
   obtained by a mixture of winery residues, sludges from dairies and solid
   residues from food processing (grape-stalks, grape-dregs, rice husks),
   was conducted. Composting process lasting five months was monitored by
   chemico-physical, spectroscopic (FTIR, DTG and DSC), microbiological and
   enzymatic analyses. Biological activities (ATP, DHA contents and several
   enzymatic activities), impedance variations (DT) of mixed cultures
   during growth and potential pathogens (E. coli and Salmonella sp.), were
   determined. The phytotoxicity tests gave a germination index higher than
   90\% and no significant genotoxic differences between controls and the
   compost samples were evidenced. Pathogens were not found on the cured
   compost that can therefore be satisfactorily used as amendment for
   agricultural crops. However, no single measurement of a composting
   process factor, biological, chemical or physical, gave a comprehensive
   view of the quality of a specific composting.
   We proposed a tool of bioindicators of potential activity and markers in
   combination for integrated evaluation of monitoring of composting
   process and compost quality. The responses of several enzymatic
   activities were positive and indicative of their favorable use capable
   to reveal even very small changes within microbial population and
   activity in test and monitoring of compost programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic toxicity studies were conducted with an algae (Nannochloris

   sensitivities to the thiocarbamate herbicide thiobencarb
   (S-4-chlorobenzyl diethylthiocarbamate). Most of the algal populations,
   were initially affected by exposure to the herbicide. Thiobencarb
   concentrations higher than 0.5 mg/L significantly reduced algal
   densities after 24-h exposure. The 24-h static EC50 in D. magna was 3.01
   mg/L. The sublethal effects of 0.3, 0.37, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.5 mg/L of
   thiobencarb concentrations on the survival, reproduction, and growth of
   D. magna were monitored for 21 days. The parameters used to determined

Abstract = {{Method development and validation studies have been completed on an
   assay that will allow the determination of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
   acid (2,4-D) in human urine. The accurate determination of 2,4-D in
   urine is an important factor in monitoring worker and population
   exposure. These studies successfully validated a method for the
   detection of 2,4-D in urine at a limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 5.00 ppb
   (parts per billion) using gas chromatography with mass selective
   detection (GC/MSD). The first study involved the determination of 2,4-D
   in control human urine and urine samples fortified with 2,4-D. Due to
   chromatographic interference, a second study was conducted using C-14-
   2,4-D to verify the recoverability of 2,4-D from human urine at low
   levels using the GC/MSD method. The second study supports the results of
   the original data.
   The 2,4-D was extracted from human urine using a procedure involving
   hydrolysis, using potassium hydroxide, followed by a liquid-liquid
   extraction into methylene chloride. The extracted samples were
   derivatized with diazomethane. The methylated fraction was analyzed by
   GC/MSD. Quantitation was made by comparison to methylated reference
   standards of 2,4-D. Aliquots fortified at 5, 50-, and 500-ppb levels
   were analyzed. The overall mean recovery for all fortified samples was
   90.3\% with a relative standard deviation of 14.31\%.}},

Title = {{Monitor-to-monitor temporal correlation of air pollution and weather
   variables in the North-Central US}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE ANALYSIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Numerous time series studies have reported associations between daily
   ambient concentrations of air pollution and morbidity or mortality.
   Recent personal exposure studies have also reported relatively high
   longitudinal correlation between personal exposures to particulate
   matter (PM) and home outdoor PM concentrations, lending support to the
   health effects reported in time series studies. However, the question
   remains as to how well the temporal fluctuations in the air pollution
   levels observed at an outdoor monitor represent the temporal
   fluctuations in the population exposures to pollution of outdoor origins
   in a city, and how such representativeness affects the size and
   significance of risk estimates. Also, such spatio-temporal correlations
   would vary from pollutant to pollutant, likely influencing their
   relative significance of statistical associations with health outcomes.
   In this study, we characterized the extent of monitor-to monitor
   correlation over time among multiple monitoring sites for PM less than
   10 mum (PM10), gaseous criteria pollutants, and several weather
   variables in seven central and eastern contiguous states (IL, IN, MI,
   OH, PA, WI, and WV) during the study period of 1988-1990. After removing
   seasonal trends, the monitor-to-monitor temporal correlation among the
   air pollution/weather variables within 100-mile separation distance in
   these areas could be generally ranked into three groups: (1)
   temperature, dew point, relative humidity (r>0.9); (2)O-3, PM10, NO2 (r:
   0.8-0.6); and (3) CO, SO2 (r<0.5). Using the subsets for separation
   distance less than 100 miles, regression analyses of these
   monitor-to-monitor correlation coefficients were also conducted with
   explanatory variables including separation distance, qualitative (land
   use, location setting, and monitoring objectives) and quantitative(large
   and small variance) site characteristics, and region indicators for Air
   Quality Control Region (AQCR). The separation distance was a significant
   predictor of monitor-to-monitor correlation decline especially for PM10
   and NO2 (<similar to>0.2 drop over 30 miles). Site characteristic
   variables were, in some cases, significant predictors of
   monitor-to-monitor correlation, but the magnitude of their impacts was
   not substantial. Regional differences, as examined by AQCR, were in some
   cases (e.g., in Metropolitan Philadelphia) substantial. In these areas,
   the pollutants that had generally poor monitor-to-monitor correlation in
   the overall seven states data (i.e., for SO2 and CO) showed higher
   monitor-to-monitor correlations, comparable with PM10 and O-3, within
   the AQCR. These results are useful in interpreting some of the past time
   series epidemiological results. The differences in monitor-to-monitor
   correlations found across pollutants in this work ( i.e., r similar
   to0.8 vs. r similar to0.4) are sufficiently large that they could be a
   factor in the different pollutant significance levels reported in the
   epidemiologic literature. It is recommended that future epidemiological
   studies collect and incorporate information on spatial variability among
   air pollutants in the analysis and interpretation of their results.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor rate and population estimates for brown bullhead (Ameiurus
   nebulosus) in Presque Isle Bay, Lake Erie were monitored between 1992
   and 1999. Fish were collected by electrofishing and trapnet. Skin rumor
   (grossly observable external lesions) rare decreased from 61\% in 1992
   to 19\% in 1999. Liver tumor rate decreased from 22\% in 1992 to 0\% in
   1999. Length-frequency histograms, collection of young of year in
   seines, and field observations of reproductively active adults indicate
   that the population is reproducing. Population estimates from a
   mark-recapture index resulted in similar estimates for 1992 and 1999.
   These results suggest an improvement in habitat quality and the general
   health of the brown bullhead population.}},
