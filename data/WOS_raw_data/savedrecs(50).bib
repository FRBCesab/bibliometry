Abstract = {{The proposed National Children's Study has helped raise awareness of the
   issues related to children's health and the importance of monitoring die
   growth and development of children from preconception through adulthood.
   Many genetic predispositions can adversely impact the normal development
   process, and various environmental exposures have been linked to adverse
   reproductive health in rodent models and a small number of accidental
   human exposures. To monitor reproductive health and identify adverse
   effects at the earliest possible juncture, investigators must develop a
   network of biomarkers covering all stages and aspects of reproductive
   development and function. Biomarkers are biological indicators that can
   be measured repeatedly and are informative on one or more aspects of
   biological development or friction. They can range from the anatomical
   level down to the molecular level and may provide information on the
   nature of an exposure, the effect of an exposure, or the susceptibility
   of individuals or populations to the toxic effects of an exposure. In
   theory, biomarkers can be used to monitor a wide variety of conditions
   and responses ranging from abnormal development to early indicators of
   late-onset disease. The main stumbling block with this theory has been
   finding appropriate biomarkers for particular conditions and exposures.
   Such biomarkers must be easily accessible, robust, and sensitive.
   Ideally, they will be expressed across a large section of the
   population, and can be monitored quickly, easily, conveniently, and with
   minimal cost. In this review, we discuss some of the current and
   emerging biomarkers of human pubertal development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a structured evaluation of a novel multimedia
   chemical fate and multi-pathway human exposure model for Western Europe,
   IMPACT 2002, using data for PCDD/F congeners. PCDD/F congeners provide
   an illustration of the potential use of POPs (Persistent Organic
   Pollutant) data for the evaluation of such models. Based on available
   emission estimates, model predictions with and without spatial
   resolution are evaluated at three different stages against monitored
   data: at environmental contamination levels, food exposure
   concentration, and in terms of human intake fractions (if): the fraction
   of an emission that is taken in by the population. The iF is similar to
   3.5.10(-3) for emissions of dioxin in Western Europe. This iF compares
   well to the traditional non-spatial multi-media/-pathway model
   predictions of 3.9.10(-3) for the same region and to 2.10(-3) for the
   USA. Approximately 95\% of the intake from Western European emissions
   occurs within the same region, 5\% being transferred out of the region
   in terms of food contaminants and atmospheric advective transport. (C)

Abstract = {{As part of a large-scale monitoring program of bioaccumulating
   contaminants in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) in Flanders
   (Belgium), we investigated potential effects of xenoestrogens in these
   fish. The present paper describes the results of the plasma vitellogenin
   (VTG) content, measured in 142 eels sampled at 20 different locations,
   in relation to the internal pollution levels. To validate the blood VTG
   assays, a small number of eels (n=8) was exposed to 10 mug
   ethinylestradiol/l (EE2) for 9 days. In this experiment, VTG was
   detected as a protein with a molecular weight of 214 kDa and confirmed
   by Western blotting. Compared with the solvent controls, significantly
   higher concentrations of VTG were measured in EE2 exposed eel. However,
   the VTG content was relatively low compared with other fish species
   exposed to high concentrations of estrogens. The plasma VTG content of
   eels from the field study was very low, despite a very high internal
   load of endocrine disrupters. These results, together with previously
   published studies, suggest that immature yellow European eel might not
   be the best sentinel species to study the effects of estrogenic
   compounds on VTG levels of wild fish populations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{437-444}},
Abstract = {{Rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) are a widespread centrarchid species
   with both riverine and lacustrine populations. After precipitation
   events, rivers often carry elevated silt loads, where as lakes generally
   remain free from suspended silt and sediment. To examine the
   physiological effects of silt on rock bass, we conducted a series of
   experiments using fish from Lake Opinicon and the Grand River in
   Ontario. Ultrasonic Doppler flow probes were surgically affixed around
   the ventral aorta to monitor cardiovascular performance. After recovery
   from surgery replicated treatment groups were exposed to incremental
   increases in silt load (made from bentonite slurry), while cardiac
   output and its two components, heart rate and stroke volume, were
   measured simultaneously. Although both groups of rock bass responded
   significantly to low concentrations of silt (10 NTU), the response by
   riverine rock bass was rapidly extinguished by acclimation or
   physiological adjustment. Compensatory mechanisms to minimize cardiac
   (and respiratory) disruption attributable to increases in suspended silt
   appear to be inherent in rock bass of riverine origin. These fish appear
   to fully compensate for interference in gas exchange at the gill
   surfaces 60 min after initial exposure. In contrast, individual
   lacustrine rock bass were highly variable in their response to elevated
   silt concentrations. Changes in stroke volume and cardiac output
   suggested no clear compensatory mechanism or strategy to cope with
   increased silt levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Major water bodies in and around the city of Calcutta (India) receive
   heavy metal contaminated effluents from industries, households, and
   vehicular traffic through sewage or drainage. We quantified
   concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Cd from three water bodies at Kalighat,
   Tangra, and VIP Road, respectively. The concentrations of these heavy
   metals were significantly greater in the summer than in monsoon when
   heavy downpours resulted in reduced metal concentrations. Concentrations
   of metals in the mosquito Cidex quinquefascia tits also reflected such
   seasonal fluctuations. Hatchability and survivorship of C.
   quinquefasciatus significantly differed among the sites and were reduced
   significantly from the control. Exposure to heavy metals also induced
   MT-gene expression in C. quinque/ascia tits, likely helping them to
   survive in the water bodies stressed with heavy metals. MT-gene activity
   demonstrated significant variation among sites and seasons with the
   highest activity in the summer in the VIP Road population. This study
   suggests that C. quinquefasciatus could be used as an ecological
   indicator of heavy metal pollution by monitoring its MT-gene expression.

Abstract = {{Trentino Seed Bank Project started in summer 2002 and intends to
   contribute to ex-situ plant conservation in the SE Alps, carrying out an
   extensive seed collecting campaign and developing a regional, long-term
   seed storage facility. The good knowledge of plant distribution in
   Trentino allowed to select with confidence 73 top priority species and
   to target the actual populations to be sampled. In a three year period
   two teams aim to collect in the field approx. 400 seed accessions,
   supplemented by an assessment of the population size antifertility. In
   summer and autumn 2002 each team visited more than 80 sites and
   collected more than 50 seed samples, recording accurately all geographic
   data on the sites visited Full details on the collections made in 2002
   are given. The Seed Bank itself is essentially composed of a geographic
   resource office equipped with all technical local maps, GPS and GIS
   facilities; a desiccation chamber equipped with sorption driers in
   conjunction with a cooling system, an air-lock and a monitoring system,
   a seed cleaning and testing lab, incubators and two deep freezers that
   serve as a cold store.}},

Abstract = {{A research project on the conservation biology of the rare Apium, repens
   in Belgium is presented. The species is still present in five
   localities, whereas it has certainly occurred in at least 24 localities
   in the past. The (aut)ecology (soil nutrient levels and hydrology) and
   phytosociology of the species are studied within the Belgian
   populations. Presence/absence monitoring is carried out as well as
   demographic monitoring in order to determine the trend in population
   size, the plant density, and the number of flowers and of seeds produced
   per plant, and to relate these to soil water level and grazing pressure.
   Methods are given in some detail. Results show that the surface area of
   four localities in which the species grows ranges from 5 m(2) to 6 ha.
   Within these areas A. repens is present with average densities ranging
   between 1 and 200 ramets per m(2). Locally, densities up to more than
   2200 ramets per m(2) were found infrequently and short cut lawns of a
   public park. The disturbance effected by the mowing appears to offer
   optimal conditions, leading to plant densities that equal or surpass
   those in naturally optimal conditions. In another part of the
   investigation, uncertain taxa are identified by molecular techniques and
   the genetic variation within and between the populations is measured.}},

Abstract = {{Diapause fixation and development were studied in females of a Czech
   population of Aquarius paludum by monitoring changes in oxygen uptake,
   weight and reproduction potential in field adults between August and
   February. The fall in oxygen uptake related to fresh weight (from > 1000
   mul O-2 per g per h to around 500 mul O-2 per g per h) in field adults
   during early diapause was similar in two age cohorts, although the time
   of adult ecdysis differed by 50 days and thus occurred at markedly
   different temperatures and photoperiods of late August vs. early
   October. The different conditions affected the weight of females and
   thus also the absolute value of oxygen consumption: both parameters were
   much lower in the October females. The seasonal time of diapause
   termination in A. paludum did not differ from findings in other cold
   temperate insects: diapause and the photoperiodic response ended in the
   winter, as was shown by the possibility of insects' reactivation by
   26degreesC in spite of a diapause promoting daylength of 12L : 12D. In
   most females (78.6\%) ovaries matured after transfer to these conditions
   in mid-February, while ovarian maturation occurred in only 16.7\% of
   females transferred in early January and no ovarian maturation was
   observed in females transferred in early December. Ovarian maturation
   was preceded by a transient increase in oxygen consumption from 600 mul
   O-2 per g per h to 1400 mul O-2 per g per h.}},

Abstract = {{Bioaugmentation of bioreactors generally focuses on the removal of
   specific xenobiotics. Often, less attention is hereby paid to the
   recovery of other reactor functions such as ammonium-nitrogen removal.
   This work evaluated the effects on activated sludge reactor functions of
   a 3-chloroaniline (3-CA) pulse and the protective bioaugmentation by
   inoculation with the 3-CA degrading strain Comamonas testosteroni 12gfp.
   Changes in functions such as nitrification, removal and sludge
   compaction were monitored with the sludge community structure, in
   particular the nitrifying populations. Molecular techniques
   characterized and enumerated the ammonia oxidizing microbial community
   immediately after a 3-CA shock load. Two days after the 3-CA shock,
   ammonium accumulated and the nitrification activity did not recover over
   a 12-day period in the non-bioaugmented reactors. In contrast,
   nitrification in the bioaugmented reactor started to recover from day 4
   on. The molecular analysis showed that the ammonia oxidizing microbial
   community of the bioaugmented reactor recovered both in structure,
   activity and abundance, while in the non-bioaugmented reactor the number
   of ribosomes of the ammonia oxidizers decreased drastically and the
   community composition changed and did not recover. This study
   demonstrates that bioaugmentation of wastewater reactors to accelerate
   the degradation of toxic chlorinated organics such as 3-chloroaniline
   protected the nitrifying bacterial community, thereby allowing faster
   recovery from toxic shocks.}},

Abstract = {{A demonstration pilot-scale study is being conducted at a
   BTEX-contaminated site to evaluate the use of ORC(R) (Regenesis) for
   enhanced bioremediation. More specifically, the influence of
   ORC-injections on the chemical composition of the groundwater and on the
   endogenous micro-organisms at the tested site are being studied. Based
   on lab scale feasibility tests it was found that a limited oxygen
   availability reduced the degradation rate, which suggests that an
   increase of the oxygen concentration may enhance the BTEX-degradation.
   The ORC has been applied to the site in January 2003 and the evolution
   of chemical and microbial parameters is being monitored since.
   Monitoring of the in-situ and some chemical parameters revealed that
   ORC-injections led to increased dissolved oxygen concentration (up to 45
   mg/L) and pH-increases up to pH 10.5. After the ORC-injection a part of
   the monitoring wells was found to give misleading results. The effect of
   the ORC-injection on the endogenous microbial population present in the
   aquifer at the site, is followed by microbial (platings) and molecular
   techniques (PCR-DGGE) using in-situ mesocosms systems. Analyses of
   aquifer samples in time indicated the presence and activity of
   BTEX-degrading micro-organisms at the site.}},

Abstract = {{We are evaluating the use of sequence markers specific for
   dehalogenating species to assess the dehalogenating potential of
   contaminated soils and to optimize soil bioremediation process
   parameters. Two systems contaminated with toxic and persistent
   chlorinated hydrocarbons have been investigated: a soil contaminated by
   dichloroethane (DCA) and a laboratory-scale, sequential
   anaerobic-aerobic process for the treatment of a soil contaminated with
   DDTs, chlorinated benzenes (CBs) and heavy metals, (mainly Hg and As).
   The microbial population profile of samples from these soils was
   analyzed by ARISA (Amplified Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis) and
   DGGE (Denaturing gradient get electrophoresis) of 16S rRNA genes. DGGE
   band sequencing detected the presence of bacteria previously associated
   with soils polluted by halogenated hydrocarbons or present in consortia
   active in the removal of these compounds. A PCR specific assay using
   primers for Dehalococcoides sp. showed the presence of this genus in the
   anaerobic phase of the soil treatment process.}},

Abstract = {{Diesel fuel degradation by a psychrotrophic Rhodococcus erythropolis in
   liquid minimal medium and in sandy soil at 12degreesC was tested. In
   liquid culture, 80\% of diesel fuel was eliminated in 10 days. In soil,
   the degradation was monitored by a respirometric system and it was found
   that degradation yield depended on the inoculum size. The optimal dose
   for inoculation to ensure predominance of the desired bacterial
   population and high degradation yields was about 1011 cells kg(-1) soil
   dw. The soil used was an uncontaminated sandy soil. Our results showed
   that the degradation yield depended on biostimulation with N and P
   sources. Rhodococcus erythropolis appears to have significant potential
   - 85 mg.kg(-1) soil dw.d(-1) - to degrade diesel fuel at 12degreesC in
   sandy soil and it is a promising strain for large-scale bioremediation
   processes.}},

   was then introduced into the microcosms as a hypothetical vector insect.
   T. urticae populations on the second bean plant were monitored to detect

Abstract = {{Abundance of the European hare (Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778) has been
   declining dramatically in Europe. In the framework of our long-term
   ecological studies in the juniper forest at Bugac, Hungary, we have also
   monitored its population abundance. At the beginning of our researches
   the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus Linn6, 1758) had been the
   dominant herbivore species there, but as a result of two diseases in
   1994 and 1995 they disappeared. Earlier studies had showed competition
   between these two species, therefore we expected a significant increase
   in the local hare abundance after the extinction of rabbits. Our
   results, however, did not comply with this supposition. Nonetheless,
   experimental comparison of the vegetation in grazed and ungrazed plots
   proved that rabbits had been significantly decreasing the vegetation
   cover, especially that of grasses; meanwhile hares did not. Although
   grasses were the main food components of both species, their moderate
   diet overlap throughout the year does not suggest a food competition
   between them. All these findings show that population size of hares was
   not significantly limited by rabbits due to trophic overlap. Competitive
   effect of rabbit on sympatric hares had been low or it was expressed by
   the depreciation of other non-i nvesti gated population characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Tilia species are important constituents of natural broadleaved,
   deciduous forests of Europe, but have vanished from many forest during
   the past millennium. In this chapter, a survey of Tilia in Danish forest
   is presented and compared with forest management, age and structure.
   Tilia cordata and T. platyphyllos are mostly found in natural, ancient
   forests, and appear to be convenient indicators of forest management and
   forest age. Most populations are very small, but a few remarkable stands
   of both species with thousands of individuals are still surviving. The
   results point to the urgent need for installing active conservation and
   management measures, together with monitoring, in order to stabilize the
   most threatened populations of endangered woody species in Danish
   forests in general, and of Tilia species in particular.}},

Abstract = {{The large, wingless ground beetle, Carabus problematicus, occurs in
   western Europe from Finland to southern France. including the British
   Isles. Belgium is situated near the centre of its geographical
   distribution area, but this does not imply that the species occurs
   equally distributed over the country. Allozyme and microsatellite
   markers allowed a preliminary population genetic comparsion between 11
   populations of C. problematicus, collected in different eco-regions.
   Genetic diversity is higher both in larger and ancient forests, as
   compared to a recent forest. In general, the results show a high
   structuring for both allozyme and microsatellite data. Nearly all
   populations can be characterized genetically. An important conclusion is
   that conservation genetic values can differ dramatically for the same
   species according to the eco-region, and this on a relatively small
   geographic scale. C. problematicus thus shows a remarkable interaction
   between eco-region and forest history, habitat preference and population
   genetics. At least in Flanders, it appears to be a powerful model
   species, with a wide range of applications for conservation studies and
   genetic monitoring at different levels of perception.}},

Abstract = {{An invasive exotic insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) (Adelges
   tsugae) has caused widespread mortality of eastern hemlock trees (Tsuga
   canadensis) and threatens to extirpate the species from North American
   forests (McClure et al. 2001, Orwig et al. 2002). HWA-Induced mortality
   is a concern because hemlocks provide important forest structure,
   habitat, economic benefits, and aesthetic values (Beatty 1984, Kelty
   1989, DeGraaf et al. 1992 p. 92, Snyder et al. 2002). Neither HWA
   population densities nor their distribution in forests is well
   understood, hampering the ability of forest managers to respond to the
   pest. No published studies have described the distribution of HWA in
   tree crowns or within forest stands (Gray et al. 1998, McClure and Cheah
   1999, Adams et al. 2002, Casagrande et al. 2002, Mayer et al. 2002). In
   addition, standard monitoring methods have inestimable bias and provide
   limited results. Lacking better information, land managers often have to
   assume that HWA is evenly distributed and saturates the environment.
   The goal of this research is to create better monitoring methods and
   estimates of HWA densities that can help forest managers mitigate the
   pest's negative impacts. The first step is the development of a sampling
   system appropriate to the biology of HWA. The second phase is a survey
   of HWA densities in a New England forest. Early results from sampling
   suggest that there is little pattern to HWA's distribution within
   individual trees, upper and lower portions of the crown are infested at
   similar densities. However, there are differences between HWA
   populations on trees in neighboring forest stands. While, final results
   of the study are not yet available, other research may benefit from the
   methodology and initial trends documented here.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the potential of birds as indicators of sustainable
   forest management. Several reviews have been critical of birds as
   indicators of environmental change, and we discuss the major criticisms
   in the context of forest management. We address these criticisms by
   suggesting alternative approaches for an indicator research program
   including the use of focussed studies to identify cause-and-effect
   relationships, habitat modelling to act as a surrogate to extensive
   monitoring of populations, and spatially-explicit population modelling
   (1) to conduct exploratory sensitivity analysis to identify the most
   important parameters; (2) to incorporate the spatial configuration of
   habitat into consideration of the impacts of management; (3) to
   anticipate future impacts as an alternative to measuring past impacts;
   (4) and, as a means of evaluating alternative management scenarios
   including natural disturbance regimes. Birds are unlikely to be able to
   act as a precise tool for the measurement of some forest condition, but
   they could be useful indicators of sustainable forest management as part
   of an iterative research program.}},

Abstract = {{In this work an estimation of the population's ozone exposure is
   performed in the European capital cities of Athens, Paris and Rome,
   based on the recordings of 3-4 air pollution monitoring stations in each
   city with comparable location characteristics (urban kerb-site, urban
   background, urban peripheral and rural sites). For the estimation of the
   total ozone exposure the broad activity patterns of the population were
   considered (indoor, outdoor). The maximum ozone exposure was observed at
   the periphery of the urban areas and the minimum at the urban centers.
   The rural sites, even not influenced by the city plume, exhibited also
   considerable ozone exposures. In general, the entire population in the
   examined cities was more or less exposed to fairly high concentrations
   of ozone, unlike most other pollutants, regardless of the place of
   residence or the type of activity.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 65 stranded and 2 injured turtles were found in 2001 along

   program and the majority (n=42) of the stranded ones were loggerhead
   turtles and the others (n=23) green sea turtles. The main causes of
   turtle mortalities were fishing-industry related injuries and trawl nets
   drown. Damages, such as broken carapace shell or cuts from boats as well
   as other injuries related to fishing industry could be found on 25 of
   the stranded turtles. The concentrations of Cd, Pb, Fe, Cr, Ni, Se, Sb,
   As and Cu were measured in tissue samples collected from these stranded
   loggerhead and green turtles. The levels of essential elements, such as
   Fe and Cu, were detected to be the highest in most of the specimens. The
   other heavy metals were found to be present in tissues at important
   levels and, therefore, more likely to affect the health of these
   endangered turtle varieties in the Mediterranean.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of different soil samples, polluted by hydrocarbons, coming
   from tank sites located in three italian areas was carried out in order
   to evaluate the mutagenesis induction and microbial diversity reduction.
   The methodological approaches used were: soil chemical-physical
   analysis; in vitro mutagenesis tests on Vicia faba roots; Restriction
   Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) molecular analysis.
   The evaluation of the genotoxic effects was performed by studying
   Micronucleated cells (MC), Aberrant Anatelophases (AA) and DNA damage by
   Comet assay in root meristems of Vicia faba seedlings grown on soil
   samples coming from the different experimental areas. Molecular strategy
   based on the RFLP analysis of PCR fragments amplified from genomic 16S
   DNA has been used to study the bacterial community structures in the
   three polluted soils. The results obtained showed that low levels of MC
   were induced in the cells of V. faba by a growth step in soil samples.
   Relatively high values of AA were observed. The comet assay confirmed
   these results, because only one sample showed a positive comet assay.
   Molecular cluster analysis by scoring similarities obtained with Jaccard
   coefficient and a multidimensional scaling (MDS) map from the resulting
   similarities matrix were performed. A seasonal distribution of the
   microbial communities in relation to the concentration of the chemical
   substances was observed.}},

Abstract = {{Medicinal and aromatic plants are offered in a wide variety of products
   on the market. At least every fourth flowering plant is used. The
   enormous demand in botanicals results in a huge trade from local to
   international level. In the 1990s, the reported annual world-wide
   importation of pharmaceutical plants amounted on average to 400,000 t
   valued at USD 1,224 million. The international trade is dominated by
   only few countries. About 80 \% of the world-wide imports and exports
   are allotted to only 12 countries with the dominance of temperate Asian
   and European countries. Whereas Japan and the Republic of Korea are the
   main consumers of pharmaceutical plants, and China and India are the
   world's leading producing nations, Hong Kong, the USA and Germany stand
   out as important trade centres. Until now, the production of botanicals
   relies to a large degree on wild-collection. However, utilization and
   commerce of wild plant resources are not detrimental in themselves, but,
   for example, the increasing commercial collection, largely unmonitored
   trade, and habitat loss lead to an incomparably growing pressure on
   plant populations in the wild. World-wide an estimated 9,000 medicinal
   plant species are threatened. Conservation concepts and measures which
   have to meet future supply and the provisions of species conservation
   range from resource management, cultivation, shifting processing from
   consumer to source countries, species conservation to trade restrictions
   or even trade bans. Medicinal and aromatic plants are of high priority
   for conservation action, as wild-crafting will certainly continue to
   play a significant role in their future trade: the sustainable
   commercial use of their biological resources may provide a financial
   instrument for nature conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological and genetic consequences of gene flow depend on the
   amount and direction of gene flow as well as on the fitness of hybrids.
   Gene flow is hard to control in wind-pollinated plants. A well-studied
   case is the Genus Beta. We present evidence of introgression of genes
   from cultivated beet to wild Beta vulgaris populations on the Crimean
   Peninsula of Ukraine. Crimean wild beets can have two different origins,
   from European sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima) or from Beta
   trigyna. Population level patterns of isozyme variation for wild Crimean
   sea beets revealed a significant higher genetic diversity than other
   European or USA populations. Estimations on gene flow based on
   F-statistics suggest that hybridisation and introgression is high for
   sea beet on the Crimean Peninsula. Quantitative allozyme marker gave
   evidence for introgression of cultivar alleles into the gene pool of
   local sea beet populations. Future consequences of such gene flow must
   be assessed and monitored for the protection of plant genetic resources
   in Crimea.}},

Title = {{Balance between microbial calcification and metazoan bioerosion in
   modern stromatolitic oncolites}},

Year = {{2004}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-57}},

Abstract = {{Stromatolites date back some 3.5 billion years and constitute the most
   common and conspicuous fossils through the Proterozoic. These
   organosedimentary structures decreased dramatically in diversity and
   abundance by the late Neoproterozoic, a phenomenon often ascribed to
   destructive grazing by newly evolved metazoans. We investigated the
   concurrent processes of microbial calcification and metazoan bioerosion
   in one of the few locations (Rio Mesquites, Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila,
   Mexico) where living freshwater stromatolites, formed by cyanobacteria
   and diatoms, coexist with significant populations of metazoan grazers.
   We used microsensor chemical profiling and monitoring of bulk water
   Ca(2+) concentrations to determine calcification rates and their
   dependence on microbial metabolism. The bioerosive impact resulting from
   grazing by endemic hydrobiid gastropods was assessed by gravimetric
   quantification of carbonaceous faecal pellet production. Calcification
   was clearly light-dependent, reaching maximal rates (saturation) at low
   incident light intensity, and was surprisingly efficient, with
   O(2)/Ca(2+) exchange ratios well above unity, and with absolute rates
   similar to those found in corals. However, the erosive action of grazing
   snails removed most of these carbonate inputs from the oncolites. Thus,
   a precarious balance between constructive and destructive geobiological
   processes was at play in the system. The fact that accretion barely
   exceeded bioerosion in an environment highly conducive to calcification
   supports the potential impact of faunal grazing as causal agent in the
   demise of stromatolites in the late Proterozoic. Our findings indicate
   that a search for fossil evidence of bioerosive grazing in the form of
   carbonaceous faecal pellets associated with fossil stromatolites may
   provide a means to test that hypothesis directly.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change, habitat degradation, and direct exploitation are thought
   to threaten biodiversity. But what makes some species more sensitive to
   global change than others? Approaches to this question have relied on
   comparing the fate of contrasting groups of species. However, if some
   ecological parameter affects the fate of species faced with global
   change, species response should vary smoothly along the parameter
   gradient. Thus, grouping species into few, often two, discrete classes
   weakens the approach. Using data from the common breeding bird survey in
   France - a large set of species with much variability with respect to
   the variables considered - we show that a quantitative measure of
   habitat specialization and of latitudinal distribution both predict
   recent 13 year trends of population abundance among 77 terrestrial
   species: the more northerly distributed and the more specialized a
   species is, the sharper its decline. On the other hand, neither hunting
   status, migrating strategy nor body mass predicted population growth
   rate variation among common bird species. Overall, these results are
   qualitatively very similar to the equivalent relationships found among
   the British butterfly populations. This constitutes additional evidence
   that biodiversity in Western Europe is under the double negative
   influence of climate change and land use change.}},

Pages = {{39-49}},
Abstract = {{The human. environmental, and political security of international
   basins, which host about half of the world's population, is threatened
   by the lack of effective mechanisms for managing them. Integration of
   water management practices is increasingly promoted as the way ahead.
   Constraints to development of effective mechanisms for integrated water
   management of international basins, however. abound. The case study
   presented in the paper highlights some of the major challenges to the
   realization of the promising potential of international law and joint
   environmental monitoring as mechanisms for ensuring the equitable and
   reasonable use of international waters. The study focuses on the
   implications of the legal and technical cooperation between Hungary and
   Slovakia for the resolution of a water management dispute between the
   two countries which arises and revolves around the environmental
   consequences of a joint water regulation project on the Danube. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Markers are the key to genetic studies in organisms. Naturally occurring
   genetic variations in organisms, mutants obtained through induced
   mutagenesis, protein variants and differences in the sequence of DNA are
   all used as markers. Molecular markers based on DNA sequence variations
   comprise Restriction fragment length polymorphisms, Random amplified
   polymorphic DNAs, Amplified restriction fragment length polymorphisms,
   Variable number of tandem repeats, Microsatellites, Simple sequence
   repeat polymorphisms, Single-stranded conformation polymorphisms, and
   Single nucleotide polymorphisms. These are extensively used in many
   areas of biological research including gene mapping, marker aided
   selection, population genetic studies, environmental studies, varietal
   identification, disease diagnosis, forensic and paternity testing,
   biological monitoring and plant and animal breeding. Described here are
   the molecular bases, strengths, shortcomings and applications of
   molecular markers currently used in plant genetic research.}},

Abstract = {{Whitefly infestations and parasitism were monitored year-round in
   overlapping cotton crops sown on three dates in Burkina Faso. The
   relative abundance of B. tabaci (Gennadius) and its parasitoids,
   Eretmocerus spp. and Encarsia spp., was recorded in control and
   insecticide-sprayed plots. Low B. tabaci populations developed during
   the first half of the rainy season. Pest populations increased when
   rainfall was ending, and the levels reached were higher in
   insecticide-treated plots (48 nymphs/leaf) than in control plots (25
   nymphs/leaf). Parasitism reached 88.7\% in control plots, and 53.7\% in
   insecticide-treated plots. Eretmocerus spp. nymphs were more abundant
   than Encarsia spp. in both treated and control plots. A positive and
   significant curvilinear relationship was observed where \% parasitism,
   on a linear scale, rose to a plateau with logarithmic increase in host
   density. In general \% parasitism was correlated with the abundance of
   pest populations except in March and April where parasitism increased
   while B. tabaci populations decreased. In a separate experiment, adult
   Eretmocerus spp. were released into caged cotton plants to study the
   impact of augmentative releases of the parasites on the population
   dynamics of the pest. Pest densities increased from 1.47 nymphs/leaf to
   39.4 nymphs/leaf in the control, but were reduced to 0.8 and 0.6
   nymphs/leaf in the cages where, respectively, 4 and 8 parasitoids were
   released per plant. It appears that parasitism is an important factor
   reducing B. tabaci populations during and after the cotton-growing
   season, and that Eretmocerus spp. are promising biological control
   candidates against the pest in cotton.}},

Pages = {{17-33}},
Abstract = {{It is difficult to directly evaluate the efficacy of phytoremediation of
   petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants embedded in deep soil layers,
   especially if the contaminants are of relatively low concentration and
   are unevenly distributed. This report describes the greenhouse and
   laboratory experiments carried out to evaluate a field demonstration
   project. A trisector planter was designed to simulate field conditions,
   including soil profiles and field management of the trees selected. The
   third or bottom section of the planter was spiked with known quantities
   of 6 diesel-fuel components and the reduction of their concentrations
   was monitored after 200 days under the influence of the plant root
   systems. Results are statistically compared; among the three tree
   species used, milo (Thespesia populnea) and kou (Cordia subcordata) are
   more effective than false sandalwood (Myoporum sandwicense) in reducing
   the concentration of the spiked contaminant. Enumerations of populations
   of hydrocarbon-degrading microoorganisms in the bottom section suggest
   that biodegradation may be affected by the response of microorganisms to
   both the ``close rhizosphere{''} (soil within I mm of the root) and the
   ``expanded rhizosphere{''} (soil in the bottom section after root
   removal). Root exudates leached from the upper sections could be
   responsible for the expanded rhizosphere effect in the bottom section.}},

Abstract = {{Over 50\% of the U.S. population depends on groundwater aquifers for
   their drinking water. The subsurface is also where we dispose of almost
   all our municipal and industrial solid wastes, and where we intend to
   dispose of residual wastes from our cleanup of nuclear weapons program
   sites. Stewardship of residual contamination remaining after cleanup of
   legacy disposal and industrial sites is necessary in nearly every state
   to guard against potential groundwater pollution.
   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently completed two documents
   designed to coordinate science and technology activities to improve our
   understanding and management of the subsurface and stewardship of waste
   sites. In August 2001, DOE published A National Roadmap for Vadose Zone
   Science and Technology. This roadmap addresses the knowledge and tools
   needed to describe and forecast accurately the processes controlling
   contaminant movement and the consequences of subsurface contaminants on
   our groundwater. In October of 2002, DOE released for comment a
   complimentary report, the Draft Long-Term Stewardship Science and
   Technology Roadmap. This report describes technical and social
   capabilities necessary for containment and monitoring of contaminants at
   subsurface disposal and legacy cleanup sites specific to the nuclear
   weapons program sites and identifies needed enhancements to these
   capabilities.
   On October 1, 2003 the U.S. DOE will launch the Office of Legacy
   Management to play a key role in a new program designed to manage,
   document and monitor the dismantling of the agency's infrastructure from
   the Cold War nuclear weapons program. The mission of the office will be
   to provide for the long-term stewardship of legacy sites and to provide
   for the improved health and safety of DOE workers. The office will
   ensure that as the Environmental Management program completes its
   clean-up mission, the legacy activities will remain a visible priority
   responsibility of the federal government. The functions of the office
   include: land management, environmental surveillance and maintenance,
   record keeping, and maintaining benefits for former workers.}},

   of a few yellow-bellied toad populations found in the northern parts of
   the Apennines are presented. In the province of Bologna this species is
   particularly threatened, while around the region of Romagna it appears
   to be less so. Some factors were identified that could have a big effect
   on the breeding success and recruitment of the population in the
   province of Bologna. About 100 individuals were raised from eggs,
   larvae, and newly emerged juveniles collected from seven sites between
   2000-2001: some of the groups showed a high mortality. The laboratory
   tests demonstrated that the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was
   the cause.}},

   Empoasca decipens Paoli, cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Genn., and
   western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). The
   leafhopper catch was significantly higher at 60 cm than 80, 100, and 120
   em when plant heights were less than 80 cm. The number of leafhoppers on
   traps at 80 cm was similar to 60 and 100 cm but significantly higher

   cm. Total catches of leafhoppers were similar at 60 and 80 cm but
   significantly lower at 100 and 120 cm. Numbers of whiteflies were
   highest at 60 cm and lowest at 120 cm trap heights at all plant heights.
   Trap height did not influence the total catches of western flower
   thrips, which were more abundant in late-season cotton. Most flights of

Abstract = {{Samples of Pteris vittata L. ( brake fern or ladder brake) collected in
   Genova and in areas outside urban centres, have been analysed for
   arsenic content in order to assess if hyperaccumulating plants are
   suitable for monitoring purposes. Hyperaccumulation ability of the
   Ligurian fern populations was evaluated by analysing specimens grown
   with hydroponic media added with As( V). Arsenic concentrations in the
   range 2 - 310 mug g(-1) dry weight have been measured in samples
   collected in different sites along the Ligurian coast. Arsenic
   concentrations in fern fronds correlate with the estimated arsenic
   emission in the area, verifying the applicability of P. vittata as an
   arsenic biomonitor.}},

Abstract = {{Free-ranging, wild meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) were exposed
   to gamma radiation from a Cs-137 irradiator in a series of experiments
   conducted on six 1-ha meadows within a mixed deciduous forest in
   Manitoba, Canada. Over a period of 1-1.5 years in each of three
   experiments, vole populations were monitored with capture-mark-release
   techniques at nominal exposure rates of 200x, 9000x and 40,000x
   background. No effects on population or individual characteristics were
   detected up to the highest exposure rate (81 mGy/d). At this level,
   third generation voles were monitored up to a lifetime dose of about 5.7
   Gy, at a measured dose rate of 44 mGy/d. Smaller numbers of overwintered
   animals survived and reproduced normally at doses up to 10 Gy. These
   results are discussed in terms of low-LET, external chronic radiation
   effects on rodents in the laboratory and the field, relative to current
   views on appropriate benchmarks for the protection of biota. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring primarily aims through sampling or by the use
   of direct detection equipment to quantify the levels of radioactive
   substances and ionising radiation resulting from human activities and
   natural sources in the different compartments of the environment. Its
   objectives are very practical and include the quantification of the
   environmental sources of ionising radiation and the verification of
   compliance with regulatory requirements and permit limits for
   industrial, research and medical activities, as stated by their specific
   licence.
   Radioecology is a multidisciplinary science, which attempts to
   understand and to quantify the behaviour of radionuclides in the
   environment and the processes ruling their transport through natural and
   agricultural ecosystems to various receptors such as plants, animals and
   humans. A second facet of this science covers the assessment of the
   radiological dose to and effects on man and its environment from
   present, past or future, even hypothetical, nuclear activities.
   Despite their different immediate objectives, environmental monitoring
   and radioecology are complementary. Many examples illustrate the
   connections between these two approaches. For instance, transfer
   parameters generated by radioecological studies are necessary to
   estimate through models the radiological exposure of population, derive
   from the contamination level measured in a bio-indicator the quantity of
   radioactivity released from a nuclear installation, or identify
   potentially important pathways to be monitored. On the other hand,
   monitoring data will confirm important pathways suggested by
   radioecological modelling and provide site-specific data for the
   estimation of model parameters or actual data sets for the validation of
   transfer models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Euratom Treaty confers important powers to the European Commission
   with regard to monitoring and assessment of levels of radioactivity in
   the environment and discharges with effluents (Articles 35-37 of the
   Euratom Treaty). Current developments in the area relate to harmonised
   reporting of environmental data and to harmonisation of effluent
   monitoring data. Both developments relate to the requirement under the
   new Basic Safety Standards (BSS) for a realistic assessment of
   population exposure. Guidance to this effect is being prepared by the
   Article 31 Group of Experts. In the context of Article 36
   inter-comparison exercises for radionuclides measurements in
   environmental samples are organised. New challenges for environmental
   monitoring result from the requirement under the BSS to regulate also
   industries processing NORM materials. Also the international move
   towards extending the scope of environmental radioactivity to the
   protection of biota opens new perspectives. (C) 2003 Published by

   Nuclear Control (FANC) with the task of controlling the territorial
   radioactivity and the doses received by the population. Within this
   agenda, a monitoring programme has been developed over many years, in
   order to follow the main potential exposure pathways of the population.
   In practice, several potential vectors of contamination are controlled:
   air (and rain), surface water (including sediments and biota), soils
   around nuclear installations, food chain, drinking water etc. To carry
   out such work, the FANC has collaborated with public or private
   reputable organisations: The Centre of Nuclear Energy Studies of Mol,
   The National Institute of Radionuclides of Fleurus, and The Louis
   Pasteur Public Health Institute of Brussels. A synthesis of this
   monitoring programme will be presented and the most important deductions
   will be pointed out. For many years, the tendency has been for tighter
   control of artificial and natural radioactivity in the enviornment. This
   has been achieved by increasingly stringent regulations, regarding
   environmental monitoring efforts, from international organisations (EC,
   OSPAR, IAEA). In this context, the FANC in Belgium, is involved in a
   process that will lead to the adaptation of the Belgian monitoring
   programme. Different aspects of these adaptations and of their
   consequences will be presented for illustrative purposes. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A sample study of the profiles of radiation exposures to the populations
   living in the high background radiation areas (HBRAs) of the
   monazite-bearing region in Kerala, India, has been conducted by
   monitoring 200 dwellings selected from two villages in this region. Each
   of these dwellings was monitored for 1 year and the study lasted for a
   period of 2 years. The indoor gamma ray dose measurements were carried
   out using thermo luminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and the inhalation doses
   due to radon, thoron and their progenies were monitored using
   solid-state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) based twin-cup dosimeters.
   Outdoor gamma ray dose measurements were carried out using Geiger Muller
   (GM) tube based survey meters. Annual effective doses were computed,
   using occupancy factors of 0.8 and 0.2, respectively, for indoor and
   outdoor, by adding the three components. Occupants of 41.6\% of the
   houses surveyed were observed to receive the annual effective doses
   ranging between 0.5 and 5 mSv/a, 41.6\% between 5 and 10 mSv/a, 10.2\%
   between 10 and 15 mSv/a and 6.6\% greater than 15 mSv/a. The inhalation
   component was generally smaller than the external gamma ray component
   and on an average it was found to constitute about 30\% of the total
   dose. The paper presents the details of the methodology adopted and the
   analysis of the results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{61-66}},
Abstract = {{Four environmental and biological monitoring sites were strategically
   established to evaluate benzene and lead exposure assessment at various
   traffic zones of Bangkok Metropolitan Region(BMR). Biological
   measurement of 48 non air-conditioned, male bus drivers was carried to
   study the relationship between individual exposure levels and exposure
   biomarkers. The study group was further subdivided into four age groups
   (16-25, 26-35, 36-45 and 46-55 years old) to monitor the age-related
   exposure effects. A total of 12 unexposed persons were deliberately
   chosen as the control group. Measurement of unmetobolized benzene in
   blood and analysis of urinary tt-Muconic acid urine and urinary
   creatinine are recommended as biomarkers of benzene exposure.
   Measurement of lead in blood and urine is also recommended for the
   biological monitoring of lead exposure.
   During the monitoring period, benzene and lead levels at Yaowarat Road
   was C6H6 : 42.46 +/- 3.88 mug/m(3), Pb: 0.29 +/- 0.03 mug/m(3) and
   decreased to C6H6 : 33.5 +/- 1.35 mug/m(3), Pb: 0.13 +/- 0.01 mug/m(3)
   at Phahonyothin Road. Significant difference was established between the
   nonsmoking exposed group and nonsmoking control group for blood benzene
   concentrations (P < 0.001, two-tailed, Mann-Whiteney U test). Strong
   correlations were also found between trans-trans-Muconic acid
   concentrations in post shift samples and atmospheric benzene
   concentrations. Similarly, good correlation between all of biomarkers
   and lead level in air is established from automobile emissions.
   The analysis revealed that among the occupational population in the
   urban sites, the driver groups were found to have the highest risk of
   benzene and lead exposures derived from automobile emission.}},

Abstract = {{Sticky ovitraps (patent pending) were used to sample female Aedes
   aegypti (L.) weekly in a focus of dengue activity in Cairns, Queensland,
   Australia. In February 2003, transmission of dengue virus serotype 2
   began in the suburb of Parramatta Park, peaking in mid-March 2003. This
   suburb features many older, unscreened houses with high populations of
   Ae. aegypti. Highest densities (2-3.5 females per trap per week) were
   obtained during peak dengue transmission (January and February) before
   mosquito control was initiated. Beginning in late March, female Ae.
   aegypti collected in sticky ovitraps were tested for dengue viral RNA by
   using a TaqMan reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay.
   Dengue viral RNA was detected in six pools of Ae. aegypti collected in
   late March. The highest minimum infection rate was 116/1000 mosquitoes.
   After the initiation of larval control (containers treated with
   S-methoprene or lambda-cyhalothrin) and adult control (interior
   harborage sites sprayed with lambda-cyhalothrin) in early March, trap
   collections dropped to <0.5 per trap per week, and no virus was detected
   in trapped mosquitoes. Human cases subsequently dropped from a high of
   seven cases per day in mid-March to only sporadic cases in late April,
   with the final reported onset of 7 May. Sticky ovitraps have potential
   as a monitoring device for gravid Ae. aegypti and can be used to assess
   control efficacy and dengue virus activity. A sticky ovitrap index (mean
   number of female Ae. Aegypti per trap per week) could be useful in
   gauging the risk of dengue transmission.}},

Abstract = {{The Steinfeld in Lower Austria supports a population of European
   Nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) which was extensively studied during
   1997 and 1998. The study area encompassed a pine forest of 20 km(2). The
   population densities of 1.05 and 1.25 terrritories/km(2), respectively,
   lies within the range found in central European populations. Annual
   monitoring until 2001 has shown the population to be stable. To gain an
   insight into habitat use of the species, various habitat-related
   parameters were measured inside and outside the territories, namely
   structure of trees, density of trees, structure of undergrowth
   vegetation and structure of clearings. Discriminant analysis was applied
   to assess the factors responsible for habitat choice of the Nightjar
   population. The findings showed that the Nightjars' territories were
   frequently centered on a large clearing with an area of at least 0.7 ha.
   Clearings less than 50 in wide were not colonized. The requirement for a
   minimum width of a clearing in addition to a minimum area probably
   relates to better hunting conditions. Nightjars prefer trees where the
   lower edge of the crown is on average 4.38 in higher than at control
   points so that males can churr from dead branches immediately below the
   canopy. Such trees were found on the edge of clearings in the forest,
   and the edge of a clearing thus had a pronounced effect on the quality
   of a territory. In contrast to reports in the literature, neither the
   proportion of bare patches of ground nor the average height of
   undergrowth vegetation was found to be decisive for territory selection.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient concentration in Totapuri cultivar of mango leaf as affected by
   application of varying levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or
   potassium (K) was monitored in three field experiments for a period of
   nine years from 1991 to 1999. A data bank of nutrient concentration vs.
   fruit yield was established based on the mean nutrient concentration
   determined for different treatments. The data was further sub-divided
   into low and high yielding population based on yield performance. The
   Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) ratio norms were
   developed from high yielding population, while diagnosis of nutrient
   imbalance was made in low yielding plants. Forty-five nutrient
   expressions were chosen as diagnostic norms. Not withstanding
   application of a wide range of major nutrient doses, fruit yield was low
   in four to five cropping seasons. DRIS indices showed no signs of
   improvement nor there was a trend with application of N, P, or K at
   different levels. Some measures of total imbalance of nutrients in plant
   were reflected through sum of DRIS indices irrespective of sign. The
   greater imbalance of nutrients resulted in lower fruit yield. Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to extract the correlation
   structure among the nutrient in low and high yielding plants and for
   DRIS indices. The first PC derived by PCA performed both on absolute
   nutrient concentration and DRIS indices was designated as
   (N-P+Mg-S+Fe+Cu+). Involvement of several nutrients in a single PC
   indicated that, it was not possible to diagnose nutrient imbalance of
   any particular nutrient in isolation in fruit crops like mango. The
   nutrient concentration variation in mango leaf appears to be an overall
   orchard phenomenon rather than individual tree phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Dipterocarp seedling populations arising from a 1996 mast fruiting in
   closed-canopy primary lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia, were
   monitored through the 1997-8 El Nino event to investigate the effects of
   drought and other factors on dipterocarp regeneration. Of particular
   interest was the influence of herbivory and its relation to drought,
   since water stress is known to influence herbivore performance. For
   seedlings with less than 10\% leaf damage, mortality during a 6-mo
   period spanning the driest part of the drought was three times higher
   than mortality in the previous and subsequent 6-mo periods (similar
   to10\% vs. similar to30\%). Leaf production was also higher during this
   period. Survival was positively related to leaf number and negatively
   related to leaf damage. Dryobalanops lanceolata was the tallest and
   leafiest species, and had low levels of leaf damage. Depending on sample
   period, abscission of leaves with more than 50\% damage was between two
   and three times more likely than those with less than 10\% damage.
   Mortality of seedlings defoliated by more than 50\% was around twice
   that of seedlings defoliated by less than 10\%. However, fewer than 10\%
   of seedlings were defoliated by more than 50\% at any time. The effect
   of defoliation did not seem to be altered by drought. Defoliation levels
   increased after the drought, perhaps due to a resurgence of insect
   populations. Drought may become a more important influence on
   dipterocarp regeneration in future, since El Nino events are thought to
   be increasing in frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Recent concern over global amphibian population declines has highlighted
   a need for more extensive, rigorous monitoring programs. Two sources of
   variation, spatial variation and variation in detection probability,
   make the design and implementation of effective monitoring programs
   difficult. We used Pollock's robust design in a 3-year capture-recapture
   study to estimate detection probability and temporary emigration for
   Plethodon salamanders in Great Smoky Mountains National Park
   (Tennessee/North Carolina), USA. We used 12 competing models to
   determine the importance of temporary emigration, and we explored
   temporal and behavioral effects on conditional capture probabilities.
   The top 4 models all included random temporary emigration, and Akaike
   model weights indicated that this parameter was the most important.
   Models that contained behavioral effects in capture probabilities were
   selected more often than models with equal capture probabilities for
   marked and previously unmarked individuals. The ``best{''} model
   contained random emigration and behavioral effects and was selected 4
   times as often as any other model. When we included Markovian
   emigration, the probability of emigrating from the surface usually was
   less than the probability of remaining an emigrant (73\% of site-years).
   Markovian emigration estimates often were similar and always had
   overlapping confidence intervals, thus the Markovian model rarely was
   chosen over the random emigration models (only 9.6\% of site-years). Our
   study is the first to formally estimate temporary emigration in
   terrestrial salamander populations, and our results verify that
   significant proportions of terrestrial salamander populations are
   subterranean. We determined that the probability of capturing
   salamanders on the surface may also vary temporally within a sampling
   season. Therefore, we caution against using unadjusted Count indices to
   compare salamander populations over time or space unless detection
   probabilities are estimated. Temporary emigration models will improve
   abundance estimates when a large proportion of the population is
   unavailable for capture during a given sampling period.}},

Abstract = {{Recent worldwide amphibian declines have highlighted a need for
   long-term, large-scale monitoring programs. Scientific or management
   objectives, appropriate spatial sampling, and detectability all must be
   considered when designing monitoring programs (Yoccoz et al. 2001). The
   ability to establish meaningful monitoring programs currently is
   compromised by a lack of information about amphibian detection
   probabilities. We used Pollock's robust design and capture-recapture
   models that included temporary emigration to test a priori hypotheses
   about spatial and temporal variation in salamander detection probability
   parameters for populations found in Great Smoky Mountains National Park
   (Tennessee/North Carolina), USA. We explored the effects of 3
   large-scale habitat characteristics (disturbance history elevation,
   vegetation type) and found that vegetation type and elevation were
   correlated with detection probabilities. Vegetation type was an
   important covariant in estimates of temporary emigration, conditional
   capture probability, and surface population size. Contrasts that
   isolated elevation effects were significant for all detection
   probability parameters except recapture probability, despite our small
   elevational range (330 m). When detection probability parameters have
   the potential to vary over time and space, investigators should develop
   monitoring designs that permit the estimation of detection
   probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The tradition of early elk (Cervus elaphus) hunting seasons adjacent to
   Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA, provides grizzly bears (Ursus
   arctos horribilis) with ungulate remains left by hunters. We
   investigated the fall (Aug-Oct) distribution of grizzly bears relative
   to the boundaries of YNP and the opening of September elk hunting
   seasons. Based on results from exact tests of conditional independence,
   we estimated the odds of radiomarked bears being outside YNP during the
   elk hunt versus before the hunt. Along the northern boundary, bears were
   2.40 times more likely to be outside YNP during the hunt in good
   whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) seed-crop years and 2.72 times more
   likely in poor seed-crop years. The level of confidence associated with
   I-sided confidence intervals with a lower endpoint of 1 was
   approximately 94\% in good seed-crop years and 61\% in poor years. Along
   the southern boundary of YNP, radiomarked bears were 2.32 times more
   likely to be outside the park during the hunt in good whitebark pine
   seed-crop years and 4.35 times more likely in poor seed-crop years. The
   level of confidence associated with I-sided confidence intervals with a
   lower endpoint of I was approximately 93\% in both cases. Increased
   seasonal bear densities and human presence in early hunt units increases
   potential for conflicts between bears and hunters. Numbers of reported
   hunting-related grizzly bear mortalities have increased in the Greater
   Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) during the last decade, and nearly half of
   this increase is due to bear deaths occurring in early hunt units during
   September. Human-caused grizzly bear mortality thresholds established by
   the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) have not been exceeded in
   recent years. This is because agency actions have reduced other sources
   of human-caused mortalities, and because population parameters that
   mortality thresholds are based on have increased. Agencies must continue
   to monitor and manage hunter-caused grizzly bear mortality at
   sustainable levels to ensure the long-term health of the GYE population.}},

Abstract = {{Wolf (Canis lupus) impacts on prey are a central
   post-wolf-reintroduction issue in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem
   (CYE) of the western United States. Further, estimates of wolf kill
   rates, used to understand these impacts, can be biased due to
   unrecovered kills. In Yellowstone National Park (YNP), visibility of
   wolves allowed us to combine independent aerial and ground observations
   and use a double-count method to estimate the probability of recovering
   kills. We consequently used these data to adjust estimates of wolf kill
   rates. We conducted monitoring annually from 1995 to 2000 during 2
   30-day periods in early (15 Nov-14 Dec) and late winter (Mar). Estimated
   recovery rates of wolf kills for ground and aerial crews were 50\% and
   45\%, respectively, although we determined that this varied by location
   (distance from road) and possibly age (calf or adult) of the kill. The
   estimated combined recovery rate was 73\%. Estimated wolf kill rates
   were higher in late winter (2.2 kills/wolf/month) compared to early
   winter (1.6 kills/wolf/month), with an overall estimated rate of 1.9
   kills/wolf/month. The primary prey of wolves in winter was elk (Cervus
   elaphus; 90\%). During our study, 43\% of the elk killed were calves,
   28\% were adult females (cows), 21\% were adult males (bulls), and 9\%
   were of unknown age/sex. Comparing prey selection to prey availability,
   wolf packs residing on the northern range (NR) of the GYE selected for
   calves, against cows, and approximately proportional to availability for
   bulls. Prey use was different for wolf packs occupying the NR compared
   to packs residing in other areas (non-northern range {[}NNR]) and varied
   seasonally for NR packs. Variation in wolf kill rates by season, and the
   relative stability of the northern Yellowstone elk herd during a series
   of mild winters despite increases in wolf density, suggest that kill
   rates and ultimately elk population size are influenced by winter
   weather. Management of ungulates should reflect the addition of wolves

Abstract = {{We examined prey selection, search distance (measured as kin
   traveled/kill), and spatial use of recolonizing wolves (Canis lupus) in
   a multi-prey system in northwestern Montana, USA, and southeastern
   British Columbia, Canada, from 1986 to 1996. Our objective was to
   explore factors affecting these parameters to better understand
   wolf-prey relationships of recolonizing wolves. Within white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) winter ranges, wolves selectively killed elk
   (Cervus elaphus) over deer. Number of wolves (r = 0.67, P = 0.03), year
   (r = 0.68, P = 0.02), and possibly human hunter-days/elk harvested (r =
   0.55, P = 0.08) were positively correlated with variation in proportion
   of deer killed by wolves annually. Outside of severe winters,
   white-tailed deer, elk, and moose (Alces alces) appeared to be equally
   vulnerable to wolf predation. Search distance of wolves varied by up to
   12 times annually. Snow depth (r = 0.73, P = 0.03) and proportion of
   total kills by wolves that were deer (r = 0.66, P = 0.06) were
   negatively correlated with the annual variation in the total search
   distance of wolves. Search distance per wolf was correlated negatively
   with year (r = 0.66, P = 0.06) and exponentially with hunter-days/elk
   harvested (r = 0.70, P= 0.04). Space use by wolves may have been in
   response to local changes in deer abundance. Wolves appeared to select
   the most profitable prey species. Severe winters and wolf selection for
   deer, coinciding with a decrease in elk numbers, increased wolf hunting
   efficiency by reducing search distance. Further research is needed to
   determine whether reduced search distance equates to increased kill
   rates by wolves in this system. Based on the time, expense, and
   difficulty of gathering data on wolf search distance in this sytem,
   however, we recommend against assessing impacts of wolves on prey via
   measuring kill rate. Rather, we suggest monitoring impacts of
   recolonizing wolves by directly assessing cause-specific mortality and
   recruitment rates of prey species.}},

Abstract = {{American mink Mustela vison are an invasive species in many parts of the
   world (e.g. Europe, Iceland and South America) and in many of these
   areas they are a threat to the native wildlife. It is therefore
   important to establish a reliable and efficient method to estimate their
   relative abundance in order to manage their populations. In this study,
   the use of surveys of signs (scats and footprints) as a way to estimate
   the relative abundance of American mink was evaluated. Populations of
   mink in three areas of England were studied to evaluate the impact of
   three factors (surveyor, marking places and month) on the probability of
   deposition and detection of signs. Among these factors only month had a
   significant effect. In the second part of the study, sign surveys were
   compared with live trapping and it was found that the proportion of
   sections with mink signs was only loosely correlated to the abundance of
   mink as estimated from live trapping. In conclusion, this study suggests
   that, provided that surveyors are trained, that there is a sufficient
   number of marking places in each section, and that the surveys are
   carried out in comparable seasons, sign surveys are an appropriate way
   to monitor the relative abundance of mink. Sign surveys are better than
   trapping when it is necessary to monitor mink populations over large
   areas because they are less time consuming, require less manpower and
   are cheaper.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a collaboration between scientists from Environment Canada
   and COVABAR (a non-governmental organization), a 4-year study was
   conducted to monitor the presence, spread and potential impacts of zebra
   mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) along the Richelieu River. Taking
   advantage of riverbed cleanups conducted every September, a sampling
   program was set up to determine the annual colonization and spatial
   distribution of zebra mussels along the river between 1997 and 2000. A
   protocol for effective sampling coordination and scientific data
   acquisition was developed to allow that objects removed from the water
   be examined and the zebra mussels attached to them be counted and
   sampled. Results confirmed that the first massive invasion by zebra
   mussel occurred upstream of the Chambly Basin in 1996 and two years
   later at downstream sites. Size distribution of zebra mussels varied
   between years and sites which suggested strong variability in
   recruitment patterns along the river. This variability could be due to
   inter-annual variation in river discharge during summertime.
   Colonization rate of unionids by zebra mussels was still low in these
   early years of colonization in the river. It is recommended that a long
   term sampling program coupled with specific ecological studies be
   conducted in order to assess the abundance and impacts of zebra mussels
   in the Richelieu River. Sampling responsibility for such monitoring
   should be transferred to non-governmental organization in order to
   increase public awareness to the problem of exotic species and
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworms Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea longa were
   inoculated into Calvert landfill site in spring 1992, in conjunction
   with the planting of two tree species Alnus glutinosa and Acer
   pseudoplatanus. Monitoring has taken place over a period of 11 years.
   Sampling in 2003 revealed that earthworm distribution no longer equated
   to the inoculation treatments; the worms had spread extensively. The
   presence of A. glutinosa had a significant effect(p < 0(.)01) on
   earthworm number (mean density 198 m(-2)) and biomass (34 g m(-2))
   compared to plots where A. pseudoplatanus had been planted and
   subsequently died (mean density 118 m(-2); biomass 21 g m(-2)). Results
   suggest that tree presence may be critical to earthworm community
   development.
   In 2002, the spread of A. chlorotica from the original points of
   inoculation had reached. 60 m with the highest recorded population
   density at 108 m(-2) with a mass of 18(.)6 g m(-2). A. longa was
   recorded at a distance of 132 m from the nearest point of inoculation
   with the highest recorded population density at 70 m(-2) with a mass of
   49(.)3 g m(-2), 10 m from the original inoculation grid. Other species
   recorded (and \% of total) were Aporrectodea rosea (0(.)9) Lumbricus
   castaneus (7(.)4), Eiseniella tetraedra (21(.)5) and Lumbricus rubellus
   (4(.)5). The two inoculated species, A. chlorotica (40(.)4) and A. longa
   (25(.)3), accounted for two thirds of the earthworms found on site. The
   highest earthworm community density was, 213 m(-2) with a mass of 73(.)9
   g m(-2) at 10 m from original point of inoculation.
   In 1999, treatments of surface organic matter (OM), in the form of
   composted green waste, and rotavation were applied to non-replicated
   plots of 50 m(2) with the effects on earthworm distribution and
   abundance recorded in 2002. Addition of OM alone led to an increase in
   number and mass (331 m(-2); 95 g m(-2)) compared to the control (233
   m(-2); 51 g m(-2)), while rotavation alone (111 m(-2); 36 g m(-2)) had a
   detrimental effect over the given time period.
   This long-term monitoring programme has demonstrated the development of
   sustainable earthworm communities on a landfill site. Natural nutrient
   accumulation and addition of OM on or into the soil-forming material
   appeared to assist this process. This work may help to inform
   post-capping treatment at similar landfill sites. Copyright (C) 2004

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},

Pages = {{463-471}},
Abstract = {{Richness of Ancient Woodland Indicator plant species was analysed in 308
   woodland patches that were surveyed during the Countryside Survey of
   Great Britain carried out in 1998. The Countryside Survey recorded
   vegetation plots and landscape structure in 569 stratified 1 km sample
   squares and developed a remotely-sensed land cover map of the UK. Using
   these datasets, we tested the hypothesis that Ancient Woodland Indicator
   species richness in woodland fragments was limited by patch area, shape
   and spatial isolation and that woodland patches located in the lowland
   region of Great Britain would respond differently than those in the
   upland region. The variation in Ancient Woodland Indicator species
   richness in the British lowlands (n = 218) was mainly explained by patch
   area and two measures of connectivity, the length of hedgerows and lines
   of trees in the 1 km square and the area of woodland within 500 m of the
   vegetation plot. By contrast, variation in Ancient Woodland Indicator
   species richness in the British uplands (n = 90) was related to
   Ellenberg scores of the vegetation communities sampled -a surrogate for
   habitat quality-and no significant effect of spatial structure was
   detected. It therefore appears that the degree of fragmentation of
   woodland in the British lowlands limits the distribution of Ancient
   Woodland Indicator species, while in the uplands, failed colonisation is
   a matter of habitat quality rather than a result of landscape structure.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape structure can influence demographics of spatially structured
   populations, particularly less vagile organisms such as amphibians. We
   examined the influence of agricultural landscape structure on community
   composition and relative abundance of the 4 most common amphibians in
   the Southern High Plains of central USA. Amphibian populations were
   monitored using pitfall traps and drift fence at 16 playa wetlands (8
   playas/year) in 1999 and 2000. We quantified landscape structure
   surrounding each playa via estimating 13 spatial metrics that indexed
   playa isolation and inter-playa landscape complexity. Multivariate
   ordination and univariate correlations and regressions indicated that
   landscape structure was associated with community composition and
   relative abundance for 2 of the 4 amphibians. Spadefoots (Spea
   multiplicata, S. bombifrons) generally were positively associated with
   decreasing inter-playa distance and increasing inter-playa landscape
   complexity. Great Plains toads (Bufo cognatus) and barred tiger
   salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium) usually were negatively
   associated with spadefoots but not influenced by landscape structure.
   Composition and relative abundance patterns were related to amphibian
   body size, which can influence species vagility and perception to
   landscape permeability. Spatial separation of these species in the
   multivariate ordination also may have been a consequence of differential
   competitive ability among species. These results suggest agricultural
   landscape structure may influence abundance and composition of spatially
   structured amphibian populations. This also is the first applied
   documentation that inter-patch landscape complexity can affect
   intra-patch community composition of amphibians as predicted by
   metapopulation theory. In the Southern High Plains, landscape complexity
   is positively associated with agricultural cultivation. Agricultural
   cultivation increases sedimentation, decreases hydroperiod, alters
   amphibian community dynamics, and negatively impacts postmetamorphic
   body size of amphibians in playa wetlands. Thus, conservation efforts
   should focus on preserving or restoring native landscape structure,
   hydroperiod, and connectivity among playas to maintain native amphibian
   populations and historic inter-playa movement.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the use of ecological indicators as a natural resource
   management tool, focusing on the development and implementation of a
   procedure for selecting and monitoring indicators. Criteria and steps
   for the selection of ecological indicators are presented. The
   development and implementation of indicators useful for management are
   applied to Fort Benning, Georgia, where military training, controlled
   fires (to improve habitat for the endangered red cockaded woodpecker),
   and timber thinning are common management practices. A suite of
   indicators is examined that provides information about understory
   vegetation, soil microorganisms, landscape patterns, and stream
   chemistry and benthic macroinvertebrate populations and communities. For
   example, plants that are geophytes are the predominant life form in
   disturbed areas, and some understory species are more common in
   disturbed sites than in reference areas. The set of landscape metrics
   selected (based upon ability to measure changes through time or to
   differentiate between land cover classes) included percent cover, total
   edge (with border), number of patches, mean patch area, patch area
   range, coefficient of variation of patch area, perimeter/area ratio,
   Euclidean nearest neighbor distance, and clumpiness. Landscape metrics
   indicate that the forest area (particularly that of pine) has declined
   greatly since 1827, the date of our first estimates of land cover (based
   on witness tree data). Altered management practices in the 1990s may
   have resulted in further changes to the Fort Benning landscape. Storm
   sediment concentration profiles indicate that the more highly disturbed
   catchments had much greater rates of erosion and sediment transport to
   streams than less disturbed catchments. Disturbance also resulted in
   lower richness of EPT (i.e., number of taxa within the aquatic insect
   orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) than in reference
   streams but similar total richness of invertebrate species. Each
   indicator provides information about the ecological system at different
   temporal and spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{The South-East Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) Woodlands
   Programme, funded by the Forestry Commission and Countryside Agency,
   seeks to increase the understanding of the environmental, landscape, and
   cultural importance of woodlands within these protected landscapes,
   identify key areas, and promote sustainable management.
   A key aspect of the programme is Geographic Information System
   (GIS)-based, landscape-scale analysis to enable strategic targeting of
   resources to enhance woodland biodiversity. A particular focus is on
   key, threatened species, indicative of characteristic habitat conditions
   in southeast England. Using monitoring data supplied by Butterfly
   Conservation, analysis has been undertaken of the populations and range
   of the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), and small
   pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene) butterflies in the South
   East. Once more widespread in the coppice woodlands of the region, their
   populations have been in decline for many years and are now severely
   threatened.
   Combining the mapping exercise with information about the ecology of
   these species and an understanding of their population dynamics, key
   woodland and semi-natural habitat areas have been identified where
   habitat management will help stabilise and build upon the remaining
   populations. Further work will help demonstrate how management effort
   can be co-ordinated at a landscape scale to allow further expansion of
   these butterflies across the region.}},

Abstract = {{1. A monitoring network for UK terrestrial mammals, the Tracking Mammals
   Partnership, is currently being set up to provide a coordinated
   programme to collect surveillance and monitoring data.
   2. Monitoring UK mammals is important for a number of reasons including:
   setting conservation priorities; measuring the effects of conservation
   management; managing populations of problem species and the sustainable
   use of game species; assessing the effects of agriculture and other
   human activities; providing evidence for the need for policy change; and
   because of obligations under intergovernmental treaties and national
   legislation.
   3. The bird world, largely but not solely through the work carried out
   by the British Trust for Ornithology, has provided a useful model for
   mammal surveillance and some important lessons in setting up and running
   a UK wide multispecies monitoring programme.
   4. Lessons include the importance: of annual monitoring; of long-term
   data sets of population indices rather than absolute population sizes;
   and of the use of volunteers in data collection.
   5. Two scoping studies have been carried out to assess the feasibility
   and costs of setting up a mammal surveillance and monitoring network and
   the survey methods that could be used for different species.
   6. The Tracking Mammals Partnership, comprising 23 organizations, has
   the remit of implementing the recommendations of the scoping studies.
   There are a number of programmes operating within the Partnership
   including the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme, the National Bat
   Monitoring Programme and the Breeding Bird Survey Mammal Monitoring.
   There are also a number of pilot schemes being tested.
   7. Reports on the population trend data collected should enable more
   informed policy and management decisions concerning UK mammal species.}},

Abstract = {{1. The use of live trapping in Britain to monitor small mammal
   distribution and population fluctuations is reviewed. Four small mammal
   monitoring programmes from Britain, the results of which are either
   partially or wholly unpublished, were examined to determine the nature
   and extent of information that can be gathered from long-term and/or
   large-scale live-trapping programmes, the degree to which such
   information can be extrapolated across habitats, and the likely
   precision with which long-term changes in numbers can be quantified. The
   most extensive of the surveys examined were The Mammal Society National
   Woodland Small Rodent Survey and the ADAS Hedgerow Survey. These
   monitored wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, bank vole Clethrionomys
   glareolus and, in the ADAS survey only, common shrew Sorex araneus
   population fluctuations on a broad spatial scale.
   2. The studies provided evidence of population synchrony and
   demonstrated quantitatively the effects of mast crops and local food
   supplies on rodent dynamics. Evidence of population synchrony between
   sites for wood mice and shrews suggests that it may be possible to
   extrapolate population changes from site-specific to national scenarios.
   However, this may be problematic for some species and across habitats,
   although comparison of the data from the woodland and hedgerow surveys
   suggests that there may be a degree of long-term synchrony in bank vole
   populations between the two habitats.
   3. Analysis of the capture data from the two surveys indicated that
   annual changes of 3-11\% from the population mean would be detectable
   with 85\% power if monitoring is carried out for 10 years on 50 sites;
   increasing site replication further is unlikely to result in a
   significant increase in precision.
   4. The nature of the information provided by live trapping with grids,
   as carried out in The Mammal Society and the ADAS surveys, is compared
   with that obtained from line trapping and from a range of indirect
   techniques. It is suggested that future monitoring will need to take an
   integrated approach in which information from direct and indirect
   monitoring of small mammal populations is linked with broad-scale data
   on changes in habitat availability.}},

Abstract = {{1. In Britain, five indirect methods have been used to survey for the
   presence of red Sciurus vulgaris and grey squirrels S. carolinensis and
   to monitor population trends through time. These are: visual counts
   along line transects, the use of hair tubes, counts of dreys, cone line
   feeding transects in conifer forests and feeding signs on whole maize
   bait at feeding stations.
   2. Drey counts and cone feeding transects cannot differentiate between
   red and grey squirrels and are not suitable for areas where both species
   may be present. Hair tubes require expertise and facilities to identify
   hairs to species, and the relationship between tube visits and animal
   density in different habitats is only known for red squirrels in Sitka
   spruce Picea sitchensis dominated plantations. Visual counts along line
   transects are the simplest method to do and require little equipment.
   However, in general, few squirrels are seen in a single count which
   leads to difficulties in estimating densities.
   3. In this paper we present data from several studies carried out in
   Britain to illustrate the type of data that may be collected, and to
   evaluate their accuracy and precision with which they could detect
   population change. Hair tube lines and drey counts required the fewest
   number of samples to detect population change. When effort was also
   considered, visual transects and drey counts were more economical.
   However, none of the monitoring methods discussed is very precise and it
   may be best to monitor squirrels only in terms of relative changes in
   numbers or indices of numbers through time.
   4. Our results for red and grey squirrels also illustrated that the
   number of samples required to detect population change is likely to
   differ according to the size of the survey area. Monitoring programmes
   should therefore be carefully planned in relation to spatial scale in
   order to be able to detect real population changes. Species-specific,
   quantitative thresholds to determine the significance of detected
   declines may need to be established for threatened UK mammals and
   assessed in relation to what would constitute a significant decline and
   whether it requires management intervention.}},

Abstract = {{1. A national monitoring scheme for recording the abundance of foxes and
   badgers in Britain would have to utilize a technique or techniques that
   could detect a wide range of animal densities in structurally different
   habitats. Furthermore, the likely reliance on volunteers for data
   collection means that these techniques must be easily applied by people
   with different levles of field expertise.
   2. Direct methods that rely on counts of the animals themselves (e.g.
   capture-mark-recapture, radio-tracking, spotlight counts) are generally
   unsuitable because of cost, manpower and licensing requirements, are not
   readily applied to all habitats and cannot easily be used by volunteers.
   However, density estimates derived from capture-mark-recapture and
   radio-tracking methods are likely to represent the benchmark against
   which other estimates of abundance are measured.
   3. The number of foxes killed per unit area is currently collated by
   non-governmental organisations for some patterns of land use, e.g. game
   estates. No such data are available for badgers, as this species is
   legally protected in Britain. However, the applicability of hunting
   statistics for monitoring fox abundance is limited by differences in
   culling effort, the non-independence of different culling practices
   applied in the same region, possible future changes in the legal status
   of different culling methods and changes in the ratio of land where
   foxes are and are not culled.
   4. Indirect methods that rely on counts of the signs of the animals
   (e.g. droppings, breeding refugia) are less expensive than direct
   methods, can be applied to the range of habitats found in Britain and
   can easily be used by volunteers. To date, indirect methods have been
   utilised to derive estimates of relative animal density or the density
   of social groups. However, the major factor currently limiting the use
   of indirect methods is that their relationship with absolute animal
   density has not been validated. The preliminary results of two projects
   quantifying the use of field signs as a measure of absolute fox and
   badger abundance suggest that indirect methods could be applicable for
   monitoring changes in fox and badger numbers at a national scale.}},

Abstract = {{1. The need to assess population size and change is central to any
   population monitoring programme. A range of monitoring techniques is
   available for deer, but few studies have addressed the performance of
   these techniques in terms of their accuracy and their power to detect
   population changes reliably. This study compares the performance of
   three commonly used techniques to monitor woodland deer populations in
   terms of their accuracy, precision and statistical power using field
   data and simulation modelling.
   2. Faecal Standing Crop (FSC) was found to provide the most accurate
   estimates at all deer densities studied, but was outperformed by
   distance sampling using thermal imaging in terms of precision and
   statistical power. Faecal Accumulation Rate (FAR) performed worst in
   terms of precision and statistical power, and was inferior in terms of
   accuracy to FSC. The accuracy of FAR and distance sampling using thermal
   imaging was similar.
   3. Annual surveying is not the best use of resources, since 10\% per
   annum increases or decreases in a population could not be detected by
   any of the techniques within a 3-year time period. Even with the best
   technique under the most favourable conditions of deer density simulated
   in this study, a population change could only be detected reliably once
   the population had increased by 33\% or decreased by 27\%. In the least
   favourable conditions, the respective figures were a 380\% increase or
   extinction.
   4. All the techniques studied are relatively poor at detecting
   population change, so their use in practical deer management needs to be
   treated with caution. The consequences of relying on similar techniques
   to detect population change for rare species could be severe.}},

Title = {{Is it possible to monitor mammal population changes from counts of road
   traffic casualties? An analysis using Bristol's red foxes Vulpes vulpes
   as an example}},
Journal = {{MAMMAL REVIEW}},

Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{JAN-APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Counts of road traffic casualties (RTCs) have been proposed as one
   potential method of monitoring changes in the abundance of several
   mammal species in Britain. However, before such schemes are implemented,
   it is vital that the relationship between animal density and RTCs is
   verified and quantified. In this paper, we analyse data collected as
   part of a long-term study of red foxes Vulpes vulpes in Bristol, UK to
   determine whether RTCs reflected changes in fox numbers.
   2. Associations between fox density and RTC counts were examined using
   data collected from throughout Bristol during 1978-84 (spatial model)
   and from an intensive longitudinal study in the north-west of the city
   during 1990-94 (temporal model). For both sets of data, there was a
   significant relationship between fox density and RTCs; in the case of
   the temporal model, this was only evident after the data had been
   manipulated by calculating running means across seasons. These
   regression models only explained 58\% and 43\% of the variance observed
   in the data, respectively.
   3. In both analyses, there was a significant difference between the
   distribution of casualties and the availability of different road types;
   more foxes were killed on major category roads (e.g. motorways,
   A-roads). Incorporating the length of each road category in each region
   in the spatial model improved the variance explained to 81\%. This level
   of precision would be sufficient for a national monitoring programme.
   However, we were able to minimize or eliminate a number of factors that
   could potentially confound the use of RTCs for a national monitoring
   programme; these factors are discussed in detail. At present, we
   conclude that further investigation into the validity and precision of
   this technique is required for a range of mammal species before it could
   be used in a national monitoring programme.}},

Abstract = {{1. Monitoring spatial and temporal patterns in cetacean abundance
   involves a variety of approaches depending upon the target species and
   the resources available. As a first step, the collection of incidental
   sightings or strandings information aids the construction of a species
   list and a rough measure of status and seasonal variation in abundance.
   These often make use of networks of volunteer observers although the
   wide variation in abilities and experience means that special attention
   must be paid to training and to data quality control. More robust
   monitoring of numbers requires quantification of effort and some
   correction for factors that influence detectability, such as sea state.
   2. The presence of cetaceans may be recorded visually, or indirectly by
   acoustics. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and their
   applicability may vary between species. The use of fixed stations tends
   to allow sustained monitoring at relatively low cost but coverage is
   limited to the immediate vicinity. For more extensive coverage, mobile
   platforms are necessary. Platforms of opportunity such as ferries,
   whale-watching boats, etc. are often used to survey areas at low cost.
   These may allow repeat observations to be made over time, but with no
   control over where the vessel goes, it is typically not possible to
   sample wide areas, thus limiting abundance estimation.
   3. Line transect surveys using dedicated platforms allow representative
   coverage of areas from which abundance estimates can be made (either
   using indices or absolute measures derived from density estimation).
   Assumptions relating to detectability and responsiveness need to be
   addressed and various methods (such as two-platform surveys) have been
   developed to accommodate these.
   4. For some cetacean species, mark-recapture methods can be applied
   using photo-identification of recognizable individuals. Again, a number
   of assumptions are made, particularly relating to recognizability,
   representativeness of sampling and capture probabilities. Capturing, on
   film, as many animals in the population as possible helps to reduce the
   problem of heterogeneity of capture probabilities. Mark-recapture
   methods require at least two sampling occasions. If multiple sampling is
   employed, either open or closed population models can be used.
   5. Measuring population change represents a particular challenge for
   mobile animals such as cetaceans. Changes in ranging patterns may have a
   large impact on abundance estimates unless very large areas are
   adequately covered. Power analysis is a useful method to indicate the
   ability of the data to detect a trend of a given magnitude.
   Increasingly, spatial modelling using GLMs and GAMs is being used to
   provide a better understanding of the biotic and hydrographic factors
   influencing cetacean distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence that a population of Plutella xylostella (L.)
   overwintered successfully in western Canada prompted studies to evaluate
   overwintering survival of diamondback moth under field conditions in
   Alberta and Saskatchewan. Successful overwintering was not demonstrated
   at either site for any life stage under a variety of tillage and organic
   matter treatments, using either laboratory-reared or field-acclimated
   specimens of diamondback moth. Diamondback moth infestations in western
   Canada evidently originate primarily from southern U.S.A. or Mexico when
   strong winds carry adults northward in spring. To provide early warning
   predictions of infestations, air parcel trajectories into western Canada
   were investigated for monitoring long-range movement of P. xylostella
   early in the season. Using wind fields generated by the Canadian
   Meteorological Centre's Global Environmental Multiscale model,
   three-dimensional air parcel trajectories were calculated using
   time-forward (prognostic) and time-backward (diagnostic) modes for
   several sites in North America. The model predicted strong northerly
   airflow in May 2001 which coincided with the occurrence of massive
   infestations of diamondback moth in canola in western Canada. The model
   can therefore serve as an important new tool for monitoring the
   dispersal of this pest to western Canadian canola crops.}},

Abstract = {{The timing of pest insect attacks can vary greatly from region to region
   and from year to year. A simulation method, based on rates of insect
   development, has been developed for forecasting the timing of insect
   attacks on cruciferous crops. The method is based on using a fixed
   number of individuals from one generation to the next and simulates the
   timing of events in the life cycle of the pests rather than their
   population dynamics. Forecasts produced for the cabbage root fly, the
   bronzed-blossom beetle and various species of Lepidoptera have been
   validated using pest monitoring data. Forecasts can be generated on
   either a regional basis from standard meteorological data, or on a local
   basis from air and soil temperatures collected by participating growers.}},

Abstract = {{Two sets of sequential presence-absence sampling plans for the
   management of diamondback moth (DBM) were developed and evaluated, one
   for the classification of levels of the proportions of plants infested
   with larvae and the other for the classification of levels of larval
   density. The action thresholds investigated were 0.15, 0.25, 0.35 and
   0.45 for proportion-based sampling plans and 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8
   larvae/plant for density-based sampling plans. Under the
   proportion-based sampling plans, the expected correct decision rates
   were > 95\% for 86-87\% of all possible population levels and the
   expected average sample size was <= 50 plants for 73-87\% of all
   possible population levels. Re-sampling analyses showed average sample
   sizes of < 40 plants in reaching the >= 95\% accuracy. For density-based
   sampling plans, an empirical proportion-density model was first
   established. The resulting model was highly significant (P < 0.001) and
   explained 97\% of the total variation in the independent variable.
   Satisfactory performance (> 95\% accuracy at < 50 plants sample size) of
   the density-based sampling plans can be expected when the true
   population density does not lie in the vicinity of the action threshold.
   In conclusion, the sequential binomial sampling plans presented here can
   be used effectively in the monitoring of DBM populations for decision
   making.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction and spawning of the scallop Pecten novaezelandiae were
   monitored at four sites in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, from July 2000
   to July 2001. A visual grading system based on the macroscopic
   appearance of the gonad was developed and tested, and changes in visual
   grade, quantitative histology, and standardised gonad mass were used to
   describe seasonal and spatial patterns in gametogenesis and spawning.
   Visual grade was significantly correlated with histological and gonad
   mass data (r(2)=0.74-0.87) and validated as an accurate method for
   measuring reproduction in P. novaezelandiae. Visual grading facilitates
   rapid assessment of reproductive condition and can be conducted
   non-destructively, thus providing a tool allowing long-term studies of
   individual spawning behavior in relation to environmental signals.
   Scallops exhibited episodic spawning, with spawning events detected in
   spring, summer, autumn, and even early winter. Gonad recovery and
   subsequent gamete development and maturation were apparent between
   spawnings. Within-season variability in gonad size and condition could
   be the result of multiple (serial) spawnings during a season. The timing
   of spawning varied among populations, probably reflecting differences in
   environmental conditions that influenced reproduction. However, the
   largest spawning events occurred at all sites in early summer
   (December/January), coincident with wind-driven upwelling conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of spatial and temporal variation in the abundance of early
   life stages is important to developing an understanding of juvenile
   recruitment processes and, ultimately, the dynamics and demographics of
   fish populations. In Victoria, south-eastern Australia, snapper, Pagrus
   auratus, supports an important fishery characterised by high variability
   in year-class strength. We investigated spatial and temporal variation
   in the recruitment of small juvenile (0+) snapper by monitoring their
   abundance in four bay and inlet nursery areas during four consecutive
   summer/autumn recruitment periods (2000-2003). We found considerable
   spatial variability in the abundance of recruits, both within and among
   inlets. Interannual recruitment variation, however, differed among
   inlets. Recruitment into the largest nursery area and most important
   fishery, Port Phillip Bay, varied by similar to10-fold across years,
   whereas variation for the other inlets was low or not significant. There
   were also clear differences in size distributions of recruits among both
   inlets and years. Strong recruitment in Port Phillip Bay during 2001 was
   related to a longer period of spawning and successful larval settlement
   and was associated with above average water temperatures. Future
   monitoring of 0+ recruitment in Victoria and studies of the recruitment
   processes should be specific to individual nursery areas.}},

Abstract = {{A hierarchical sampling design, spanning five orders of magnitude (from
   10s of metres to 100s of kilometres) was created in order to quantify
   the multi-scale spatial variability of visually censused rocky reef fish
   assemblages in the western Mediterranean Sea. Specifically, we tested
   the hypotheses that species abundance and the biomass of reef fish
   populations is higher within than outside marine reserves, and that a
   north-to-south geographical gradient of these variables exists. We also
   explored the relationship between the fish assemblage and habitat
   structure, as an environmental factor likely to account for an important
   part of the observed variability. The mixed analyses of variance
   revealed that total abundance and biomass, species richness and
   abundance and biomass of several target species reached higher average
   values within marine reserves. Nevertheless, some non-protected
   localities (e.g. Aguilas) harboured richer and more abundant fish
   assemblages than some marine reserves. In addition, regional variation,
   attributable to differences in local carrying capacity and hydroclimatic
   conditions, are also shown across the studied area. Moreover, the
   studied assemblage is patchy at small and/or intermediate spatial
   scales, considering both assemblage descriptors (total abundance and
   biomass, species richness), and the abundance and biomass of fish
   species and spatial categories. Detected patterns were different
   depending on the species and assemblage variables analysed. Differences
   in habitat structure account for a significant proportion of total
   variability of the studied variables, and are likely to be responsible
   for a large part of the observed differences, especially at
   small-to-intermediate spatial scales. Other factors-spatial variability
   in larval distribution, settlement and/or post-settlement survival-are
   discussed in order to explain the observed differences. We concluded
   that causes of the observed patchiness of Mediterranean reef fish
   assemblages are probably multiple. Long-term, multi-scale spatial and
   temporal monitoring actions, as well as process-oriented manipulative
   experiments are urgently needed in order to ascertain the relative
   importance of each factor.}},

Abstract = {{Effectiveness of conservation measures for diminished populations
   depends on the mechanism producing low abundance. In queen conch, which
   is heavily exploited, reproductive activity is depressed where conch
   density is low, which may be due to the Allee effect, poor habitat
   quality, or delayed functional maturity. To determine the mechanism
   underlying impaired reproduction in shallow seagrass beds, mature conch
   were translocated from `source' sites with high and low, ambient conch
   density (similar to1000 and similar to20 conch ha(-1), respectively),
   and kept at high density in enclosures within high- and low-density
   `host' sites. We monitored reproductive activity, and modelled conch
   population dynamics under exploitation, a reproductive Allee effect, and
   delayed functional maturity. In the field, conch from high-density
   source sites had significantly higher reproductive activity than those
   from low-density sites, although conch density was the same in all
   treatments. Thus, reduced reproductive activity at low conch density in
   shallow seagrass habitats is not due strictly to an Allee effect.
   Physiological condition of conch did not differ between treatments,
   regardless of habitat quality. Conch from high-density source sites had
   thicker shell lips, indicating that they were older, and they displayed
   significantly higher reproductive activity than younger conch with
   thinner lips. The field, morphological, and physiological evidence is
   therefore consistent only with a mechanism of delayed functional
   maturity. In model simulations, either an Allee effect or delayed
   functional maturity, combined with exploitation, produced non-linear
   population collapses. Young adult queen conch that are not functionally
   mature occur at low density in shallow seagrass habitats, and are
   heavily exploited before reproducing. Conservation efforts must be
   directed at these habitats, and not only to habitats where older
   functionally mature adults are at high density, and not susceptible to
   Allee effects.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},

Pages = {{115-128}},
Abstract = {{The southern sea palm kelp Eisenia arborea produces wide, bullate
   (bumpy) blades in low-flow areas, whereas in adjacent high-flow areas
   blades are flat and narrow. Here we determine if morphological
   differences in these 2 closely associated populations are correlated
   with physical factors in the environment, and whether this response is a
   genetically fixed or plastic trait. Both phenotypes were subjected to
   morphometric analysis, field and laboratory transplant experiments, and
   genetic analysis (M13 DNA fingerprinting). Physical variables (water
   motion, temperature, and light) were monitored simultaneously in the
   field. Results indicate that the 2 populations, separated by < 10 m, are
   genetically distinct and transplants in the field and lab remained
   similar to individuals from the original collection location, regardless
   of the imposed flow environment. Water motion varied significantly
   between the 2 populations and was the single physical variable that
   correlated with morphology. Based on bump heights and water velocities
   in the field, bullate blades could increase turbulent transport of
   nutrients 4-fold that of flat blades. The thicker blades and large
   holdfasts of the flat morph may impart higher survivorship under
   high-flow conditions. This suggests water motion selects for 2 distinct
   morphotypes of E. arborea that represent adaptations to enhance fitness
   under different nutrient availability and drag force regimes. Thus,
   blade morphology is not a plastic response to the local environment but
   a genetically fixed trait and may be indicative of nascent speciation in
   the face of strong selection by water motion over spatial scales smaller
   than observed previously in kelps.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the bacterial population (free vs. attached bacteria),
   variations in bacterial abundance and ciliate group composition were
   monitored as a function of transparent exopolymeric particle (TEP)
   concentration during Phaeocystis globosa blooms that developed in
   mesocosms. Two ciliate groups dominated at different stages of the
   blooms. The oligotrichous ciliate Strombidium spp. were dominant during
   the growth phase of the blooms, when TEP volume concentration was lower
   than 20 ppm. The hypotrichous ciliate Euplotes spp. emerged and became
   dominant after blooms peaked, when TEP concentration reached values
   between 20 and 50 ppm. The succession from Strombidium spp. to Euplotes
   spp. was closely related to TEP variation. Strombidium spp. depletion
   was apparently not caused by a reduction of prey availability due to TEP
   aggregation, as the bacterial concentration increased over time and the
   fraction of available bacteria for Strombidium spp. remained close to
   90\%, irrespective of variations in TEP concentration. Instead, the
   results of incubations conducted by adding S. sulcatum to seawater
   collected in the mesocoms suggest that Strombidium spp. disappearance
   may have been caused by direct TEP-mediated aggregation of the ciliates.
   The emergence of Euplotes spp. coincided with the formation of
   macroaggregates (favored by high TEP concentration), which provide them
   with the physical support required for feeding on attached bacteria. Our
   results suggest that variations of the size in the TEP pool may induce a
   ciliate population succession, modify the size distribution of the
   bacterial population and ultimately control the microbial food web
   structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{While the species level effects of marine reserves are widely
   recognized, community level shifts due to marine reserves have only
   recently been documented. Protection from fishing of top predators may
   lead to trophic cascades, which have community-wide implications.
   Disease may act in a similar manner, regulating population levels of
   dominant species within a community. Two decades of data from the
   Channel Islands National Park Service's Kelp Forest Monitoring database
   allowed us to compare the effects of fishing and urchin disease on rocky
   reef community patterns and dynamics. Different size-frequency
   distributions of urchins inside and outside of reserves indicated
   reduced predation on urchins at sites where fishing removes urchin
   predators. Rocky reefs inside reserves were more likely to support kelp
   forests than were fished areas. We suggest that this results from
   cascading effects of the fishery on urchin predators outside the
   reserves, which releases herbivores (urchins) from predation. After
   periods of prevalent urchin disease, the reef community shifted more
   towards kelp forest assemblages. Specific groups of algae and
   invertebrates were associated with kelp forest and barrens communities.
   The community dynamics leading to transitions between kelp forests and
   barrens are driven by both fishing and disease; however the fishery
   effect was of greater magnitude. This study further confirms the
   importance of marine reserves not only for fisheries conservation, but
   also for the conservation of historically dominant community types.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton pigments in samples taken from nutrient-enriched and
   non-enriched 3 m(3) seawater enclosures were separated and quantified
   using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The enclosures were
   with and without inorganic (N, P, Si) and organic (glucose, C) nutrient
   enrichments, resulting in a variation of phytoplankton groups in time
   and space. The relative contribution of the major phytoplankton groups
   to the total chlorophyll a (i.e. chlorophyll a plus chlorophyllide a)
   was estimated by the CHEMTAX program. The results were compared to
   phytoplankton groups identified and quantified by light and
   epifluorescence microscopy. For the pigmented flagellate groups the
   results obtained by microscopy and pigment analyses using the CHEMTAX
   program showed similar trends. The picocyanobacteria were readily
   quantified by microscopy and the results were similar to those obtained
   by flow-cytometry, while the CHEMTAX program for the cyanobacteria
   revealed different trends. Microscopy and pigment analyses provided
   similar trends in diatom population development. Estimated diatom
   contributions to total phytoplankton biomass, however, were considerably
   higher when based on microscopy than when based on the CHEMTAX program,
   especially in Si-amended enclosures. Total chlorophyll a:carbon ratios
   for diatoms were at the lower end of a previously reported range between
   1:27 and 1:67. For the pigmented flagellate groups the total chlorophyll
   a:carbon ratios were above that range. In routine monitoring of
   phytoplankton we recommend the use of the CHEMTAX program based on HPLC
   pigment analyses accompanied by a screening for the dominating species
   by microscopy, and by flow-cytometry for quantification of
   picocyanobacteria.}},

Pages = {{153-161}},
Abstract = {{Tributyltin (TBT) pollution has been assessed in NW Brittany since 1992
   using the bioindicator imposex in Nucella lapillus. The Bay of Brest is
   highly polluted by TBT and the outgoing water mass has contaminated the
   adjacent NW coasts. However environmental conditions have been improving
   in NW Brittany. The decrease in TBT pollution is most likely due to the
   reformulated antifouling paints (with slower leaching rates or TBT-free)
   that are used for civil and military careening activities in the Bay of
   Brest. An increase in imposex levels in 1998 could have been due to the
   launching of the aircraft carrier `Charles de Gaulle'. It remains
   unknown when imposex levels reached their maximum because of the lack of
   annual surveys in 1996, 1997 and 1999. This underscores the need for
   annual surveys when using imposex as a monitoring tool. At 3 locations
   within the Bay of Brest, new populations of N. lapillus have appeared
   since 1998. At other stations, populations have grown in number of
   individuals and colonised adjacent rocks. The percentage of less
   severely affected imposex females (vas deferens sequence stage 3) has
   increased since 1998. As TBT could soon be banned from antifouling
   paints, further recovery of favourable environmental conditions for N.
   lapillus is expected.}},

Abstract = {{We combined field monitoring and laboratory experiments to examine the
   population ecology of both the microscopic and macroscopic stages of a
   new invasion of Undaria pinnatifida in California. Over the course of 1
   yr, we observed 2 distinct recruitment pulses of individuals in the
   Santa Barbara harbor; the appearance of these pulses was strongly
   correlated with a 4degreesC drop in ocean temperature approximately 2 mo
   prior to recruitment, Cultures of zoospores and successive microscopic
   stages revealed thermal tolerances consistent with field recruitment
   data; individuals grown at 13degreesC had significantly higher
   survivorship than individuals grown at higher temperatures (harbor
   temperatures annually ranged from 12 to 21degreesC). The 2 cohorts also
   differed greatly in individual size, growth rate, and survival to
   maturity. Grazing by herbivores, predominately the native kelp crab
   Pugettia producta, effectively prevented nearly all individuals in the
   second cohort from reaching reproductive maturity. Grazer control was
   effective despite far higher rates of recruitment during the second
   recruitment pulse. Our results highlight the potential for extreme
   variability in U. pinnatifida demography mediated by local oceanographic
   and biotic factors. Understanding controls on U. pinnatifida demography
   helps to explain variation in the spread and impact of this invader
   worldwide, and allows better prediction of when and where U. pinnatifida
   may continue its invasion along the west coast of North America.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to assess environmental integrity based on PRC analysis
   was proposed, tested, validated and developed. Environmental health
   assessment and community studies usually result in complex biological
   data sets. In order to find ecologically relevant patterns and
   tendencies from such sets of data it is necessary to reduce all the
   information to a summarised and simplified form, which might be more
   easily interpreted by ecologists, politicians, end-users and the
   population in general. However, several multivariate ordination methods
   currently used (e.g. redundancy analysis, principal component analysis,
   or multi-dimensional scaling) produce complex diagrams for the
   non-ecologist, which do not allow changes in biological communities over
   time to be easily understood. Here, we propose a recently developed
   method, principal response curves (PRC) analysis, to overcome these
   issues. This method has advantages over traditional ordination
   techniques, or any biotic index, in that it provides a powerful
   statistical analysis of temporal data series along spatial gradients.
   The PRC technique can make use of non-disturbed or unpolluted areas as
   reference sites with which other areas are compared, making it possible
   to assess changes in species composition between different areas over
   time. Moreover, individual species responses to stress agents can be
   inferred from the PRC curves. As well as providing insights into the
   behaviour of natural ecosystems - in particular, how ecosystem integrity
   changes over time - this new approach can potentially provide a
   practical tool for monitoring and implementing environmental policy
   instruments.}},

Title = {{Effects of harvest date on maize in the humid sub-tropical mid-south USA}},
Journal = {{MAYDICA}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Abstract = {{Limited capacity for artificially drying maize (Zea mays L.) grain
   exists in the mid-south USA. Most of the area's production is
   field-dried and thus subjected to risks inherent to leaving mature crops
   in the field. A two-year experiment to assess some of the effects of
   delayed harvest on maize grain yield and other characteristics was
   conducted at Stoneville, MS. Six maize hybrids (three Bt and three
   non-Bt) were field grown in 2000 and 2001. Grain was hand harvested and
   shelled at 14, 28, 42 56, and 70 d post-physiological maturity (P-PM).
   Grain moisture levels declined with increased delays in harvest both
   years. Levels safe for handling and storage (150 mg g(-1)) were acquired
   at 28 cl P-PM in 2000 and 42 d P-PM in 2001. Grain moisture fell below
   120 mg g(-1), 28 d P-PM in 2000 making it subject to mechanical damage.
   Declines in grain bulk density at 70 cl P-PM may he explained by such
   damage. Bt hybrids had less stalk lodging than non-Bt hybrids, and
   lodging tended to increase as hat-vests were delayed. Aflatoxin
   contamination Was minimal in 2000 and non-existent in 2001. Fumionisin
   levels were higher in 2001 than 2000. Adverse effects on yield and grain
   quality With delayed harvest appear minimal, inherent risks Of crop
   losses due to weather exist though, and monitoring grain moisture and
   the weather are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Soil collected from an upland pasture was manipulated experimentally in
   ways shown previously to alter microbial community structure. One set of
   soil was subjected to chloroform fumigation for 0, 0.5, 2, or 24 h and
   the other was sterilised by gamma-irradiation and inoculated with a
   10(-2), 10(-4), 10(-6), or 10(-8) dilution of a soil suspension prepared
   from unsterilized soil. Following incubation for 8 months, to allow for
   the stabilization of microbial biomass and activity, the resulting
   microbial community structure (determined by PCR-DGGE of bacterial
   specific amplification products of total soil DNA) was assessed. In
   addition, the functional stability (defined here as the resistance and
   resilience of short-term decomposition of plant residues to a transient
   heat or a persistent copper perturbation) was determined. Changes in the
   active bacterial population following perturbation (determined by
   RT-PCR-DGGE of total soil RNA) were also monitored. The manipulations
   resulted in distinct shifts in microbial community structure as shown by
   PCR-DGGE profiles, but no significant decreases in the number of bands.
   These shifts in microbial community structure were associated with a
   reduction in functional stability. The clear correlation between altered
   microbial community structure and functional stability observed in this
   upland pasture soil was not evident when the same protocols were applied
   to soils in other studies. RT-PCR-DGGE profiles only detected a shift in
   the active bacterial population following heat, but not copper,
   perturbation. We conclude that the functional stability of decomposition
   is related to specific components of the microbial community.}},

Abstract = {{A wheat germin gene, with oxalate oxidase (OxO) activity, can be used as
   a sensitive reporter gene in both monocot and dicot transformations.
   Detection of H2O2 generated from OxO oxidation of oxalate provides
   simple, rapid detection of gene expression. Inexpensive substrates are
   required for both assays. OxO activity, could be detected
   histochemically in minutes, without chlorophyll clearing procedures.
   This assay was used to optimize transformation procedures and to track
   stable transgene expression in breeding populations over many
   generations. A simple spectrophotometric quantitative enzyme activity
   assay was used to select lines with various levels of transgene
   expression and to monitor transgene silencing phenomena. The
   quantitative OxO assay can also be used as an internal DNA delivery
   standard with a second reporter gene used in gene expression studies.
   The simplicity of the assay is ideal for screening large populations to
   identify primary transgenics, for monitoring transgene segregation in
   large populations in field studies and for assessing stability of
   transgene expression over numerous generations.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial accuracy in the detection and monitoring of mountain pine beetle
   populations is an important aspect of both forest research and
   management. Using ground-collected data, classification models to
   predict mountain pine beetle-caused lodgepole pine mortality were
   developed for Landsat TM, ETM+, and IKONOS imagery. Our results suggest
   that low-resolution imagery such as Landsat TM (30 m) is not suitable
   for detection of endemic level populations of mountain pine beetle.
   However, good results were obtained for pixels with groups of red
   beetle-killed lodgepole pine (> 25 trees killed per 30-m pixel),
   implying that Landsat imagery is most suited to detection of populations
   at the building or epidemic phase. Preliminary results using high
   resolution IKONOS imagery (4 m) suggest that detection of individual or
   small groups of red beetle-killed lodgepole pine can be accomplished
   with a relatively high accuracy.}},

Journal = {{NEMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{97-107}},
Abstract = {{Population densities of Rotylenchulus reniformis were investigated in 15
   cm horizons from the surface to 120 cm deep in field plots under fallow,
   grain sorghum (cv. Asgrow 571), and susceptible (cv. DP6880RR) or
   resistant (cv. HY798) soybean. In 2000, population densities were
   monitored in non-fumigated plots and in plots fumigated pre-season with
   1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) at 38 em depth. Fallow, grain sorghum and
   resistant soybean reduced the incidence of R. reniformis down to 120 cm
   in comparison to susceptible soybean. In 2001, population densities were
   monitored under cotton in these plots and in additional plots that had
   grown susceptible soybean cv. Vernal or resistant cv. Padre in 2000 and
   that were fumigated before the 2001 crop with 1,3-D at depths of 0-60,
   60-120, or 0-120 cm. In 2000 non-fumigated plots, cotton fibre yields
   were increased by an average 35\% after fallow, grain sorghum or
   resistant soybean compared to those after susceptible soybean. In the
   2000 fumigated plots, cotton fibre yields were increased 38\% after
   grain sorghum and resistant soybean compared to those after susceptible
   soybean or fallow. In plots cropped previously to susceptible soybean,
   fumigation at 60-120 cm deep increased cotton fibre yields by 68\%
   compared to the non-fumigated control. Population densities in the 0-120
   cm horizon were a more accurate predictor of plant damage than those at
   0-30 cm. The value of R. reniformis-resistant soybean cultivar-cotton
   crop sequences was confirmed and the importance of their effects on
   deep-occurring populations of R. reniformis demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Extraction of large numbers of living and debris-free nematodes is based
   on the active downward migration of nematodes through muddy sediments.
   This study is an assessment of how representative the extracted nematode
   population is in comparison to the in situ population. Nematode
   extraction efficiencies ranged from 20-29\%; however, the method yielded
   153 000 and 223 000 debris-free nematodes in 48 h (per m(2) of mud with
   nematode population density of 776 000 individuals m(-2)). Sieve mesh
   size, migration device mesh size, and size distribution and behaviour of
   nematode species all influenced the extraction results. The species
   composition of the extracted nematode populations was significantly
   different from the in situ population assemblage. Metachromadora remanei
   and M. vivipara migrated less efficiently than Ptycholaimellus jacobi,
   Chromadora macrolaima and Daptonema oxycerca. This bias should be
   monitored in experimental studies using nematode populations extracted
   by means of sieving and downward migration.}},

Abstract = {{This study was based on naturally occurring and inoculated populations
   of steinernematid nematodes. The nematode populations were monitored in
   spring and autumn in 2 consecutive years in an organic cropping system
   and changes in population size were related to the presence of potential
   insect hosts. Nematode populations were estimated in terms of nematode
   incidence (percentage of positive soil samples) by using Tenebrio
   molitor larvae as bait. The population of naturally occurring nematodes
   (Steinernema affine and S.feltiae) was generally low (0-17\% incidence
   for S. affine and 0-18\% incidence for S.feltiae). Inoculated S.feltiae
   established well in half of the plots where inoculation had been
   performed and reached incidences of 87\%. Establishment of inoculated
   nematodes, and population dynamics in general, was clearly influenced by
   the presence of insect hosts. In crops with high densities of potential
   hosts (Sitona lineatus in pea and partly Delia radicum in cabbage),
   nematode incidence increased from spring to autumn, whereas nematode
   incidence remained unchanged or decreased when few hosts were present
   (in barley, carrots, alfalfa and leek).}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of the three principal species of sharpshooter
   (Dilobopterus costalimai Young Acrogonia sp. c Oncometopia facialis
   Signoret), vectors of Xylella fastidiosa causal agent of Citrus
   Variegated Chlorosis, was studied by using geostatistics. The
   evaluations were carried out in a commercial `Pera' sweet orange (Citrus
   sinensis {[}L] Osb.) grove budded on Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia Osb.)
   located at Bebedouro, Sao Paulo state, aiming to establish better means
   for vector and disease control. The sharpshooters were monitored using
   with 50 uniformly distributed 3{''} x 5{''} yellow sticky traps hanging
   down in branches at 1.5 m up to the ground, which were replaced monthly.
   Acrogonia sp. was the prevalent species sampled. The results were used
   to adjust population models to semivariograms of the spatial
   distribution of the three sharpshooters species in the grove. During the
   three consecutive years of sampling, the population of Acrogonia sp., D.
   costalimai and O. Jacialis showed an aggregated distribution only during
   summer, winter and spring, respectively, showing that intensive
   monitoring of these vectors is necessary to control their population in
   periods favorable to their development. The aggregation area of the
   sharpshooters within the orange grove was determined using geostatistic
   parameters. Acrogonia sp. showed a mean aggregation area of 15,760 m(2),
   whereas for O.facialis and D. costalimai, the corresponding areas were
   11,555 m(2) and 10,980 m(2), respectively. Therefore, in order to obtain
   a reliable estimate of sharpshooter populations, at least one trap
   should be used per hectare.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial refuges and mark-recapture techniques were used to monitor
   the non-target impacts of hand-broadcast application (simulating aerial
   application) of Wanganui No,7 cereal-based baits containing 0.15\% (1500
   mug g(-1)) 1080 on populations of weta and other invertebrates in
   Tararua Forest Park, North Island, New Zealand. Wellington tree weta
   (Hemideina crassidens) and a cave weta (Isoplectron sp.) were the only
   species of weta that occupied the refuges. Flatworms, slugs, spiders,
   harvestmen, amphipods, millipedes, centipedes, cockroaches, and beetles
   also occupied the refuges. Invertebrate numbers in the refuges were
   monitored for 12 months before and 4 months after bait application on 22
   August 2000. Bait application had no significant impact on the numbers
   of either species of weta, or on slugs, spiders, and cockroaches, the
   most numerous other invertebrates occupying the refuges. Bait
   application also had no effect on the number of individually marked tree
   weta resighted in the refuges. Few weta or other invertebrates were
   observed on baits at night. The concentration of 1080 in a cave weta
   collected alive from a bait, and in a tree weta collected alive from
   outside an artificial refuge, was less than 10\% of the average lethal
   dose. The results indicate that 1080-poisoning for vertebrate pest
   control is unlikely to have any negative impact on populations of weta
   or the other invertebrates monitored.}},

Abstract = {{Population densities of the endemic red admiral butterfly, Bassaris
   gonerilla, were monitored over two summers on Banks Peninsula, New
   Zealand. Egg-laying usually begins in September and ends in late May.
   Peaks in egg, larval and adult densities suggest that B. gonerilla
   completes two full generations per season and in favourable years, a
   third generation is started but not completed. Population density was
   lower in a low-rainfall season probably because of the lower survival
   and nutritional quality of the host plant, Urtica ferox.
   ``Non-target{''} parasitism levels by Pteromalus puparum (introduced to
   manage populations of the small white butterfly Pieris rapae) were low
   at 3.5-16.9\% of pupae collected from the field. However, parasitism by
   the self-introduced pupal parasitoid Echthromorpha intricatoria was very
   high at 67.5-82.3\%. Echthromorpha intricatoria can overwinter in B.
   gonerilla pupae and is thus capable of attacking all generations of B.
   gonerilla. More long-term data are needed to determine the status of,
   and regulatory mechanisms affecting B. gonerilla populations.}},

Title = {{The impact of exotic weed competition on a rare New Zealand outcrop

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Nearly one quarter of New Zealand's unique vascular plant flora is
   threatened, and weed invasion is implicated in the decline of more than
   half of these threatened species. However, there is little experimental
   evidence showing that invasive weeds have a direct impact on threatened
   native plants. This study experimentally tested the hypothesis that
   competition with invasive weeds threatens the rare outcrop plant
   Pachycladon cheesemanii (Brassicaceae). Pachycladon cheesemanii is a
   threatened South Island, New Zealand endemic with a distribution nearly
   confined to rock outcrops. It has disappeared from historical record
   sites throughout its range. The effects of weed competition and habitat
   on P. cheesemanii establishment, growth and survival were investigated
   by sowing seed into replicated plots subject to three treatments: weed
   removal, soil disturbed and unweeded control, in three habitat types:
   forested and open rock outcrops and open tussock grassland. The
   experiments were carried out at three locations: Mt Somers (Canterbury),
   Wye Creek and Diamond Lake (Otago). Within weedy rock outcrop habitat,
   weed removal significantly increased the rate of P. cheesemanii
   germination, and appeared to increase seedling growth rates, implying
   that weeds can negatively impact populations. Relative to rock outcrop
   habitat, P. cheesemanii germination was very low in adjacent open
   grassland habitat regardless of weeding treatment. Demographic
   monitoring Of four natural populations of P. cheesemanii revealed that
   seed production is highly variable among populations and may be limited
   by browse and mechanical damage to inflorescences. Pachycladon
   cheesemanii does produce a persistent seed bank but most seed is found
   close to parent populations. Our results suggest that competition with
   invading weeds threatens current P. cheesemanii populations, that plant
   establishment can be enhanced by weed removal, and that considerable
   potential exists for artificially expanding populations by sowing seed
   into appropriate weed-free habitat.}},

Title = {{Correlations between human-made structures, boat-pass frequency and the

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},

Abstract = {{Negative effects of human presence and activities on breeding success
   and survival of many water bird species are well documented. The New
   Zealand dabchick (Poliocephalus rufopectus) is a protected endemic New
   Zealand grebe, confined to the North Island mainland and classified as
   vulnerable. A third of the total New Zealand dabchick population live on
   the lakes of the central volcanic plateau, where there is potential
   conflict between humans and dabchicks. We used data from two independent
   surveys describing the distribution of New Zealand dabchicks to
   investigate the effect that human-made structures (i.e. jetties and
   houses) and human recreational activities (i.e. boating) have on the
   numbers of New Zealand dabchick pairs, chicks and nests in the bays of
   Lake Rotoiti, Tarawera and Okareka. Our results suggest that human-made
   structures and recreational activities are not significantly affecting
   the numbers and distribution of New Zealand dabchick pairs or nests at
   this time. Furthermore, the number of human-made structures was
   positively correlated with the number of chicks in the sampled bays.
   Humans and dabchicks may be distributed similarly around the lakes
   because factors such as wind exposure and shoreline topography made
   certain sites preferable for both species. Alternatively, human-made
   structures may provide protected nesting environments and/or cover for
   chicks from predators, refuges from harassment by other bird species, or
   other benefits. Pairs may therefore be able to raise chicks to the
   fledging stage more successfully. However, little is currently known
   about dabchick life history or population dynamics. We recommend that a
   method of capturing and marking be developed so that further monitoring
   of behavioural and population changes can be carried out. It is also
   necessary to conduct research on how boats and human activities at
   jetties affect incubating dabchicks and their young during the nesting
   phase.}},

Abstract = {{In autumn 1998 a farm scale replicated field trial was established in
   Waikato, New Zealand, to measure the productivity of combinations of old
   and new ryegrass and white clover cultivars. Colonisation in the first
   two years of the trial by Costelytra zealandica, Heteronychus arator,
   Naupactus leucoloma and Sitona lepidus was monitored. By the end of
   winter 2000, no difference in densities of any of the pest species
   monitored could be attributed to cultivar treatments. However, dispersal
   behaviour and soil type did have a significant effect on pest densities.
   Naupactus leucoloma, which disperses by walking, was found in greatest
   densities on the edges of the trial. Costelytra zealandica, which
   disperses by flying, was initially aggregated in paddocks with
   shelterbelts. Heavy infestations of H. arator, which also disperses by
   flying, were associated with good soil drainage. Sitona lepidus, which
   disperses by flying, was evenly distributed across the trial.}},

Abstract = {{The Devils River minnow Dionda diaboli is a threatened species once
   endemic to a portion of the Rio Grande drainage in western Texas and
   northern Mexico but now found only in the Devils River and San Felipe
   and Pinto creeks. Because little is known about the biology of this
   species, it is difficult to establish protocols for maintaining captive
   populations. We monitored the production of Devils River minnows in two
   laboratory culture systems containing four substrate types (rocks,
   gravel, sand, and Spawntex) within each of two habitat types (riffle and
   pool) that had two sub-habitat types each (upper and lower riffle,
   covered and uncovered pool). A total of 38 adult fish (mean weight =
   1.38 g; mean total length = 54 mm) were introduced into the two culture
   systems (19 fish each, approximately equal sex ratio) on 5 September
   2001. From 18 September to 6 December, 2,269 young were removed. A
   Significantly greater number (1,922; three-factor nested analysis of
   variance {[}ANOVA], Fisher's least-significant-difference tests, P less
   than or equal to 0.05) were in gravel substrate (2-5 cm diameter).
   However, no differences were found in the counts of young with respect
   to habitat or sub-habitat type. The indoor culture of Devils River
   minnows is possible using gravel as a spawning substrate and, since
   parental stock can be manipulated, the technique can be used for
   establishing refugium populations and for augmenting wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the occurrence of raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris
   procyonis) in common raccoons (Procyon lotor) in the Allegheny Mountains
   of West Virginia during spring (n = 9, April-June) and fall (n = 5,
   August-October) 2001 and spring (n = 7) and fall (n = 4) 2002. We found
   no evidence of B. procyonis infection in 25 raccoons sampled by fecal
   floatation and necropsy methodologies. However, we did detect Capillaria
   sp. eggs in 28\% and Strongyloides sp. eggs in 64\% of individual
   raccoons, respectively. Baylisascaris procyonis has been implicated in
   population declines of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister) in the
   northeastern United States. The low prevalence of B. procyonis in an
   area inhabited by what is believed to be a stable population of
   Allegheny woodrats supports conservation measures to continue to monitor
   anthropogenic activities that potentially may increase the prevalence of
   B. procyonis or raccoon interaction with Allegheny woodrats in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{The breeding suppression hypothesis predicts that females of certain
   small mammal species will reduce reproduction as a response to the odour
   of a specialised mammalian predator. This was tested in a field
   experiment with grey-sided voles ( Clethrionomys rufocanus) during three
   summer seasons (1997-1999) in the subalpine tundra of northern Norway,
   which is a natural habitat of this species. In a first phase
   free-ranging voles in six unfenced 1-ha plots were monitored by
   live-trapping from June to August each year. In a second phase from
   August to September, three of the plots were sprayed with weasel (
   Mustela nivalis) odour to simulate increased apparent predation risk,
   while the remaining three plots served as untreated controls. On all
   plots voles were individually marked with ear tattoos and were regularly
   live-trapped during the whole breeding season to follow their
   performance. On the treatment plots the recruitment rate of juveniles
   did not increase in late summer as it did on the control plots. The
   proportion of reproductively non-active adult females was significantly
   higher on the treatment plots for both old and young females. Our
   results thus verify the breeding suppression hypothesis for the first
   time under natural conditions. However, the response in overwintered
   females is in conflict with the original hypothesis because the assumed
   fitness benefits from breeding delayed until the next season are
   inaccessible to them. As an alternative explanation we propose a
   short-term response of reduced activity and interrupted breeding until
   the predator has exploited and left the feeding patch. Such a ``duck and
   cover{''} strategy would increase the fitness of females of all age
   classes when prey habitats are patchy.}},

Abstract = {{Through a literature review from the southeastern fringe of the Pacific
   Basin, I attempt to identify what aspects of El Nino determine the
   availability of resources (food and habitat) that in turn affect avian
   ecology. The evidence shows that El Nino affects seabirds essentially by
   reducing their food base. Fish- and fish + squid-eating seabirds
   generally decrease their population abundance, likely as a combined
   result of adult mortality (famine) and reproductive failure. Omnivorous
   seabirds negotiate El Nino periods without important declines, while
   those including fishery wastes in their diets show minimal changes or
   even increase their populations during such periods. Waterbirds seem to
   benefit from precipitation that accompanies El Nino, which enlarges
   their habitats (waterbodies). Increased habitat affords more
   opportunities for installing adequate nests and obtaining enough food.
   Finally, landbirds are affected by El Nino-driven precipitation, which
   fires up primary productivity (aboveground plant biomass and seed crop),
   which in turn fuels arthropod and mammal increases. Granivorous birds
   react promptly to peaks in seed output, while insectivores respond
   similarly to arthropod abundance. Carnivorous birds take somewhat longer
   to react to increases in mammal populations. I conclude that (a) Food
   shortage may be an important key factor for bird populations, but its
   effects depend on diet breadth, prey switching, and life history
   parameters; (b) Predictable (seasonal) patterns of productivity may
   determine distribution and abundance of resident birds, but variations
   imposed by unpredictable occurrences of El Nino and La Nina may
   determine the presence and abundance of migratory birds; (c) The
   dichotomy El Nino versus La Nina or other ``normal{''} years may be
   artificial; (d) Long-term monitoring is needed to understand the
   connection between climate and birds.}},

Abstract = {{Management practices for the critically endangered Puerto Rican Parrot
   (Amazona vitatta) since 1973 have included proactive efforts to increase
   nesting success through improvement of natural nest cavities, placement
   of artificial nest cavities, and close monitoring of nesting activity
   and active intervention. While these practices have resulted in improved
   overall nesting success over previous passive management, recent
   application of electronic monitoring techniques has increased not only
   nesting success, but also knowledge of the nesting and behavioral
   ecology of the species. These new techniques include both audio and
   video monitoring of active nest cavities, allowing for accurate
   documentation of nesting activities and early detection of potential
   problems with minimal disturbance to the nesting pair. Herein we discuss
   design, costs, and implementation of these monitoring systems. We also
   summarize the benefits accrued to date, as well as the transferability
   of these readily available, and user-friendly, technologies in natural
   history studies and population management of other cavity-nesting
   species in Neotropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{From 1998 to 2002 we monitored changes in the relative abundance of
   Asian houbara bustard Chlamydotis macqueenii across the greater part of
   its range in Kazakhstan. The areas most frequented by houbara bustard
   were the Kyzylkum region, with 35\% of total sightings, and the
   Betpak-Dala/Muyunkum region with 25\%. For all survey areas combined,
   mean relative abundance ranged from 0.004 to 0.017 individuals seen per
   km driven. Density estimates ranged from 0.025 to 0.086 houbara bustard
   per km(2). Between 1999 and 2002 spring relative abundance and density
   decreased by 65 and 51\% respectively. Likewise, autumn relative
   abundance decreased by 56\% from 1998 to 2001 and density decreased by
   35\% between 1999 and 2001. Kyzylkum had the greatest declines in
   relative abundance during both spring (78\%) and autumn (61\%). It is
   highly probable that this observed decline in houbara bustard
   populations is linked to hunting and poaching pressure, both in
   Kazakhstan and on the wintering grounds of these Central Asian breeding
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a simple and accurate real-time PASA (PCR
   amplification of specific allele) (rtPASA) protocol for the estimation
   of pyrethroid resistance allele frequency in pooled DNA samples using
   the T929I-mutated allele of sodium channel alpha-subunit gene from the
   diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, as a model. Conditions for the
   rtPASA for the detection of the T929I mutation were optimized by
   adjusting annealing temperature, template, and primer concentrations.
   Using standard DNA mixtures of susceptible and resistant alleles in
   various ratios, a plot of allele frequency versus cycle threshold value
   (C-t value) was generated for the prediction of allele frequency. The
   semi log plot was linear within the 1-80\% range of resistance allele
   frequencies with a high correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.997) when
   highly stringent conditions (67 degreesC annealing temperature and 2 ng
   template DNA) were used. For the detection of lower frequencies of the
   resistant allele (0.004-1\%), another hyperbolic semi log plot was
   constructed (r(2) = 0.983) using the C-t values obtained from the rtPASA
   with less stringent conditions (66 degreesC annealing temperature and 5
   ng template DNA). The rtPASA was able to detect the resistant allele at
   frequency as low as 0.02\%. The performance of the rtPASA was evaluated
   by comparing with the data generated from 50 individual genotypings. We
   demonstrated that the actual resistance allele frequency of a field
   population of P. xylostella precisely matched the predicted frequency
   deduced by our protocol, The rtPASA format is applicable for the
   detection of additional mutations associated with resistance in other
   insect pest species and will allow rapid and efficient monitoring of
   resistance in field populations in a high throughput format. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{In many fire-prone habitats around the world, natural fire regimes have
   shaped the evolution of the associated flora. Critical life history
   stages are often linked to fire in species that occur in these
   fire-prone habitats but many species are unstudied. We investigated
   seedling emergence patterns over time, after several fires in
   south-eastern Australia, for three obligate seeders in the Genus
   Leucopogon (Family Epacridaceae): L. setiger, L. esquamatus and L.
   exolasius. Fixed quadrats were monitored for 12 to 30 months for newly
   emerged seedlings, both after fire and in unburnt L. exolasius and L.
   esquamatus habitats. There was a flush of seedling emergence in the
   first year after fire for all three Leucopogon species, with smaller
   pulses recorded in subsequent years. Time elapsed between fire and the
   onset of emergence differed between fires, but not between Leucopogon
   species. Whatever the timing of the fire, seedling emergence was
   restricted to the late autumn and winter periods, coinciding with
   emergence in unburnt habitat. This contrasts with patterns of emergence
   previously reported for other taxa, and also in this study, where
   emergence of the Leucopogon species after fire was delayed compared with
   co-occurring species in other genera. Our results suggest that seasonal
   factors are important to the germination ecology of these species and
   that combinations of fire-related and seasonal factors are necessary to
   maximise germination. Rainfall has a non-seasonal pattern in the study
   region and seasonal emergence post-fire has not previously been
   recorded. The magnitude of delay to emergence of species with seasonal
   emergence patterns will be determined by the season of fire but not by a
   seasonal pattern of rainfall in the post-fire year. A shift of the peak
   fire season could increase this delay, possibly affecting plant
   population recovery.}},

   amount of CWD density was higher, populations fluctuated less,
   survivorship was better and residency time was longer. These results
   were in accordance with predictions of habitat heterogeneity and CWD
   played an important role for demography of P maniculatus in managed

Abstract = {{This paper. aims to assess the relationship between the urinary activity
   of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and its isoenzyme B (NAG-B) and
   cadmium (Cd) concentration in the urine as well as to evaluate which of
   these lysosomal enzymes may be a more useful biomarker for the
   monitoring of Cd-induced tubular damage. For this purpose we have used
   an experimental model in rats chronically exposed to Cd in which we
   noted damage to the proximal tubules, including lysosomes. In rats
   intoxicated with 5 mg Cd/dm(3), the urinary activities of NAG and NAG-B
   increased after 12 weeks of treatment, while at 50 mg Cd/dm(3) -
   activities increased already after the 1(st) week. The urinary Cd
   excretion in Cd-exposed rats, but not in the non-exposed ones,
   positively correlated with the activities of NAG and NAG-B. A positive
   correlation which was observed between NAG and NAG-B activities was
   stronger in Cd-exposed animals than in those not exposed. The results of
   the present and our previous histopathological and histoenzymatic
   studies, confirm the usefulness of total NAG and NAG-B as sensitive
   markers of proximal tubular injury for the monitoring of chronic
   exposure to Cd. Taking into account the strong correlation between the
   total NAG and its isoenzyme B, similar correlation coefficients between
   their activities and Cd concentration in urine and simplicity of total
   NAG determination compared to that of NAG-B, one can conclude that the
   determination of total NAG is suitable for the monitoring of exposure to
   Cd. As the urinary activity of total NAG is a sum of activities of
   several isoenzymes, which may be influenced by various factors. and the
   intralysosomal localization of NAG-B, we hypothesize that NAG-B should
   be recommended as a sensitive and useful marker for routine monitoring
   of chronic exposure to Cd.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal zone is characterized by its complicated physical processes and
   fragile ecological environment because of its land-sea interactive
   environment, and more and more population and social-economic properties
   have been attracted to this area because of its advantageous geographic
   location. Various human activities have brought many kinds of
   environmental problems, among of which water pollution has become a key
   trouble in the coastal area of the world. In this paper the discussion
   focused on the framework of coastal water management system and its
   kernel function spatio-temporal analysis based on RS/GIS technology and
   statistical software. The Pearl River estuary and its adjacent coastal
   waters of Hong Kong were taken as a case, software ArcGIS was employed
   as a basic platform for developing the coastal water environment system
   and spatial analysis, Geo-database was used to manage the
   temporal-spatial data, ERDAS IMAGINE and SPSS were used to analyze the
   temporal-spatial data. A related-data model was proposed to solve the
   problem of data communication between ArcMap and SPSS, which is a basis
   of spatio-temporal analysis. Data mainly came from remote sensed images
   and monitoring program of water quality in the study area. Two
   parameters, suspended solids and DO, were selected to discuss the
   spatio-temporal analysis. The spatio-temporal analysis of suspended
   solids was based on 152 suspended solids concentration maps revised from
   the remote sensed images NOAA/AVHRR in the time period of 1995 and 2000,
   and the result showed that the spatio-temporal dynamics of suspended
   solids can spatially quantify the distribution and diffusion of
   land-source materials and direct the movement of the coastal waters. The
   buffering analysis of DO in 2001 showed that an obviously offshore
   increment and the lowest levels mainly appeared within 1 km in the near
   shore waters. Those analyses can provide with scientific information to
   coastal water environment management and decision making.}},

Abstract = {{The Okefenokee Swamp is the largest freshwater wetland in the United
   States; however, population dynamics of the fish assemblage within the
   swamp are poorly understood. Fish surveys from 1992-2001 indicate that
   two species, bowfin (Amia calva) and flier (Centrarchus macropterus),
   are the numerically dominant taxa of the eastern portion of the swamp,
   representing over 88\% of all fishes collected. Results indicated that
   the fish assemblage was persistent and stable in terms of constancy of
   dominant species presence and their abundances. The four most abundant
   species, bowfin, flier, chain pickerel (Esox niger), and warmouth
   (Lepomis gulosus), had high relative conditions in all years. When
   combined with high catch-per-unit-effort and angler-preferable sizes,
   these results suggest that the eastern swamp has the potential to
   support an excellent flier and bowfin fishery, as well as a lesser
   fishery for chain pickerel and warmouth. Lack of traditional sport
   fishes and other fishes common to the area was likely attributable to
   the abiotic conditions of the swamp, specifically low pH levels.
   Managers should consider publicizing the unique and excellent fishery
   available in the eastern portion of the Okefenokee Swamp.}},

Abstract = {{Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are ecological generalists that use a variety
   of landscape and habitat types. Although space and habitat use are well
   understood for raccoons throughout the southeastern United States,
   relationships between space use and landscape characteristics are not.
   We examined relationships between space use and landscape
   characteristics for 95 radio-marked raccoons monitored during 1996-1997
   on two adjacent forested landscapes that differed in forest management
   strategies. We noted relationships between space use and patch richness,
   proportion and size of riparian habitats on the landscape, and size of
   patches providing soft mast resources. Raccoons within an
   intensively-managed forest maintained spaces with reduced patch richness
   and less of the landscape in riparian habitats, likely attributable to
   forest management strategies that optimize wood fiber production.
   However, raccoons within this system consistently maintained spaces with
   larger patch sizes of riparian habitats and habitats containing soft
   mast (early successional plant communities). Our findings suggest that
   raccoons living on landscapes with intensive forest management select
   larger patch sizes of quality habitats relative to raccoons living on
   forested landscapes with less intensive management regimes. Because
   raccoons in intensively-managed forests may maintain smaller spaces than
   raccoons in other forested systems and appear to be influenced by
   landscape patterns, managers should recognize influences of forest
   management practices on raccoon behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Annual recruitment of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo
   silvestris) should be closely monitored to regulate fall turkey seasons
   and reduce risk of over-harvest. However, previous studies have not
   encompassed the spatial or temporal scales needed to produce models that
   can consistently predict recruitment over a large region. Our objective
   was to assess the ability of using long-term data sets of sex-age
   ratios, oak (Quercus spp.) mast, and weather variables to forecast
   annual wild turkey recruitment in western Virginia. We conducted a
   thorough literature search on factors believed to be limiting
   reproduction and developed a series of 14 a priori models and I a
   posteriori model to predict recruitment. We used fall harvest ratios of
   juveniles per adult female, averaged over 26 western Virginia counties,
   during 1973-2002 as an index to annual recruitment and investigated the
   relationship of recruitment to age structure of the population, oak mast
   production in the previous fall, and spring weather. We considered
   impacts of different weather severity measures and investigated effects
   of deviation from mean, 90\%, and 75\% quartile values on recruitment.
   Our best model (omega(9) = 0.812) predicting recruitment incorporated
   May and June rainfall and March temperatures at the 75\% quartile scale.
   This model accounted for a significant amount of variation in
   recruitment residuals (R-2 = 0.50, R-adj(2) = 0.44). Monitoring these
   selected weather parameters offers managers the ability to predict
   significant changes in recruitment annually.}},

Abstract = {{Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) has used auditory call counts
   annually since 1949 to monitor white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica)
   populations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Recently,
   white-winged doves have been expanding their distribution, and now the
   largest populations occur in urban areas north of their historic south
   Texas range. It has become necessary to develop an urban survey method
   to better monitor these populations. We compared two call count sampling
   methods for surveying white-winged doves in urban environments (i.e.,
   transects vs. grid-points in Austin during 1999-2002 and San Antonio
   during 2001-2002). We also determined the percent annual population
   change we were able to detect for each year with the current sample size
   using the grid-point survey method. Estimates of white-winged dove
   breeding density were higher using the transect method compared to the
   grid method each year. Power analysis indicated that with current sample
   sizes in each city, we were able to detect between a 20\% and 30\%
   annual change in mean population density in both Austin and San Antonio.
   We conclude the grid method can be more effective at reflecting the
   spatial distribution of white-winged doves in urban areas than the
   original transect approach. The grid method should be improved to reduce
   variance if it is to be used in the future. Accuracy of survey methods
   were not evaluated here. To obtain more reliable estimates of density,
   other methods such as distance sampling should be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{To assess how white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herd
   demographics influence reproductive behaviors, we examined 24-h diel
   movements of female white-tailed deer relative to parturition and
   breeding in a low-density population with a near even sex ratio at the
   Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina. We conducted a series of
   intensive, 24-h radio-tracking periods of 13 females during spring and
   fall 2002. We compared daily range (ha), rate of travel (m/h), and
   distance between extreme daily locations (in), among the periods of
   pre-parturition and post-parturition and pre-, peak-, and post-rut. From
   pre-parturition to post-parturition, we observed decreases in diel range
   size (-38.2\%), distance between extreme diel locations (-17.0\%), and
   diel rate of travel (-18.2\%). Diel range size, distance between extreme
   diel locations, and diel rate of travel during the pre-rut and rut
   exceeded those observed during post-rut. We further identified
   substantial increases in mobility during 12 24-h diel periods for eight
   females during our fall monitoring. Our data suggest that female
   white-tailed deer reduce mobility post-fawning following exaggerated
   movements during pre-parturition. Furthermore, despite a near equal sex
   ratio, estrous does may be required to actively seek potential mates due
   to low population density.}},

Abstract = {{The Dominican Republic shares the island off Hispaniola with Haiti. The
   country has a total area of 48,442 km(2), a narrow insular shelf of
   9,484 km(2) and an EEZ of approximately 239,000 km(2). Around 10,000
   artisanal fishers with a fleet of 3,750 boats, operate from the 1,575 km
   of coastline to exploit the fisheries resources of the country. The
   fisheries sector is made up mainly of artisanal fishers, with high
   levels of import accounting for more than 50\% of local fish
   consumption. With average annual production of 11,600 MT, the fishery is
   believed to be exploiting the traditional resources at or beyond their
   maximum sustainable yields. The main threats identified in the coastal
   zone include: overfishing, degradation of critical habitats; poorly
   managed boating, recreational diving, increased tourism, and stress from
   coastal development and population growth.
   In June 2000 the CARICOM Fisheries Unit, in collaboration with the
   Government, initiated a program to improve management of fisheries.
   Preliminary assessments confirmed that there are major deficiencies in
   the institutional and organizational system for sustainable development
   and management of the fisheries and aquaculture resources. Significant
   improvements are needed in: the institutional arrangements and capacity
   for planning and policy formulation; the systems and capacity for
   research and collection of data; and the arrangements for extension
   services, monitoring, control and surveillance. There is also a need for
   greater organization and involvement of fishers in fisheries planning
   and decision-making regarding the fisheries. On the positive side there
   is strong political will to improve the fisheries sector with the
   support of national and international partners. In this paper a review
   of past and current management measures is undertaken and
   recommendations are provided for strengthening the sector.}},

Abstract = {{In efforts to maintain viable shark populations, the National Marine
   Fisheries Service (NMFS, an agency of NOAA) developed the 1993 Fisheries
   Management Plan (FMP) for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean (NOAA 1993)..
   This plan stresses the need for monitoring and assessment of shark
   populations to determine the efficacy of FMP measures. NMFS Mississippi
   Laboratories (MSL) instituted field surveys (beginning 1995), with
   support from the NMFS Highly Migratory Species Division, to assess
   distribution and relative abundance of coastal sharks in the western
   North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. In order to assess the extent
   of shared shark and teleost populations between Mexico and the U. S.
   within the. western North Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, NMFS
   and the Instituto Nacional de la Pesca (INP) of Mexico instituted a
   cooperative bottom longline research initiative that operates under
   auspices of MEXUS-Gulf. The first of a series of cooperative projects
   was conducted during summer of 1997, with subsequent projects during
   1998, 2001 and 2002 {[}Grace 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2002]. Scientists
   representing INP, NMFS and several Mexican and U. S. based institutions
   and universities participated. Gear, survey design and project
   objectives for the Mexico based effort was consistent with NMFS U. S.
   based surveys. One hundred and sixty five bottom longline stations were
   completed during 51 survey days. Captures include 97 sharks, 57 other
   elasmobranches and 248 teleosts. The MEXUS-Gulf bottom longline surveys
   have been successful for developing a useful fisheries independent
   database.}},

Abstract = {{A good sampling and monitoring program for insects and mites is
   essential for implementing an integrated pest management program for
   mango pests. While some progress has been made for individual species,
   precise and pro-active sampling programs in mango agroecosystems
   continue to be in their infancy. Mango flowers are attacked by midges,
   leafhoppers, caterpillars, thrips, as well as mites. A sequential
   sampling plan for monitoring hopper populations has been developed in
   India, whereas sampling techniques for the mango blister midge or mango
   gall midge, Erosomyia mangiferae Felt, and Dasyneura mangiferae (Felt)
   are unknown. Fruit fly numbers are easily monitored with pheromone
   traps, although trap catches have not been related to the risk to the
   crop in different areas. Intra-tree distribution, sampling techniques
   for mango seed weevils, Sternochetus mangiferae (F.) and S. gravis (F.)
   have been developed. Sampling techniques and thresholds for pests of
   leaves and buds i.e., gall midges Protocontarinia matteiana Kieffer and
   Cecconi, Erosomyia spp., and Procontarinia schreineri Harris are seldom
   practiced. The mango bud mite, Aceria {[}Eriophyes] mangiferae Sayed,
   attacks buds of terminals. Because of the difficulty to assess mite
   densities in the field, the relationship between bud proliferation and
   mite densities could be used to determine action levels. The spatial
   distribution of Rastrococcus invadens Williams a polyphagous mealybug
   infesting leaves, flowers and fruits was studied by Boavida et al.
   (1992) who developed binomial sampling plans for estimating population
   levels. Because many mangoes are destined for export, the sampling
   intensity and knowledge of action thresholds must be considered in order
   to provide a high quality fruit.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wied.), and some species of
   the genus Anastrepha (Diptera: Tephritidae) are among the world's most
   important agricultural pests substantially reducing fruit yields and
   limiting commercialization. Thus studies aimed at improving the control
   of these pests though better integrated management technologies
   including monitoring methods is of major importance. Studies were.
   conducted to find the most effective combination of lures for monitoring
   fruit fly populations in mango. The trapping system consisted of the
   Plastic McPhail Trap (PMT) with the following lures: NuLure (NL),
   Ammonium Acetate (AA), Putrescine (PT), Trimethylamine (TMA), Propylene
   Glycol (PG), Ammonium Bicarbonate (AB), Torula (T), Bio Anastrepha(TM),
   the preservative Borax and the surfactant Triton. The experiments
   consisted of an independent test in mango orchards that lasted eight
   weeks. The region called ``Median Jaguaribe Valley{''} is located
   between 51 and 7degrees southern latitude and 461 and 470 western
   longitude. The methodology was based on a Standard Research Protocol

Abstract = {{Today's growing population and increasing urbanization has resulted in
   sudden increase in number of vehicles. The problem posed with vehicles
   is due to discharge of pollutants ( CO, HCl, Pb, SOx, NOx, PM. etc.). It
   is known fact that 60 \% of air pollution in city is caused by
   automobiles only 1. The effect of these pollutants is observed at acute
   level on sensitive species both plants and animals. Plants are
   considered for investigation of effect of autoexhaust pollutants.
   Response of plants towards air can be assessed by air pollution
   tolerance index. Acute \& chronic symptoms can be utilized to
   investigate accumulation of pollutants. Plants are affected by increased
   localized atmospheric pollution. But some plant species and varieties
   are so sensitive that they can be conveniently employed as biological
   indicators or monitors for specific pollutants. They can further assist
   human in planning the urban cities. Plants are stationary so they show
   the localized effect of pollution. A relationship can be derived within
   the Bioindicators and vehicular pollution load. This relationship can be
   utilized to plan the vehicular pollution load along a specific pathway.
   To support the study a case has been considered.}},

Abstract = {{A breeding programme has been undertaken to introgress a polygenic
   resistance to powdery mildew from P. davidiana clone P1908 into peach.
   The first step of the selection process was based on phenotypic data.
   Five interspecific hybrids between P1908 and Summergrand peach cultivar
   have been chosen for their good level of resistance to powdery mildew
   and each one was the starting point for backcross breeding schemes. The
   efficiency of this selection strategy was assessed in the light of
   molecular data (map and QTL detection) collected later on. Three
   alternative scenarios were compared by Monte-Carlo simulations: 1)
   random selection of F1 hybrids, 2) selection on phenotypic data, 3)
   selection on molecular markers. Simulations were performed in agreement
   with the genetic structure of the experimental population and the
   linkage mapping data available. For the selection of resistance loci,
   the selection with molecular markers appeared to be more efficient than
   the phenotypic selection, that itself was more efficient than random
   selection. Additional information about the genetic control of the
   resistance, collected after the selection step demonstrated the
   importance of preserving wild alleles over the whole genome. Because of
   this, the 3 scenarios were tested in reverse compared to their
   efficiency for the selection of resistance loci. When little is known
   about the QTLs controlling the character to be introgressed, which seems
   to be the case in fruit breeding, molecular markers could be used to
   monitor both the selection of target loci and the preservation of wild
   alleles on the rest of the genome.}},

Abstract = {{The red drum Sciaenops ocellatus is a popular sport fish from the
   mid-Atlantic through the Gulf of Mexico. Historical data show that this
   species supported substantial commercial as well as recreational
   fisheries. On the Atlantic Coast, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
   Commission (ASMFC) has designated this fish as ``over-harvested{''}
   requiring all coastal states to implement fishery restrictions.
   Regulations from North Carolina to Florida range from one fish to five
   fish per day within a narrow slot length limit. Unlike many states,
   South Carolina (SC) has implemented a multifaceted management approach
   involving regular monitoring of subadults and adults, strict
   regulations, and evaluation of stocking red drum. To provide a fishery
   independent assessment of the population, an inshore monitoring program
   for subadults was begun in 1991, and in 1994, an offshore monitoring
   component focused on the adult segment of the population was added. This
   latter population segment is the focus of the ASMFC's Fishery Management
   Plan. The first regulations in SC were established in 1986, and in 2001,
   regulations were amended for the seventh time to make them the strictest
   ever. In an effort to explore all management options, a research effort
   was initiated in 1988 to examine the potential for increasing abundance
   using stocked fish. Based on encouraging research findings, this program
   was expanded in 2002 to a statewide demonstration scale effort involving
   three estuarine systems. These systems were stocked with a total of 1.8
   million marked Fish in fall, 2002. Stocking project components integrate
   fishery dependent and independent sampling to assess biological
   implications and social and economic aspects are being added to provide
   a broad overview of impacts. Through this integrated approach of fishery
   and population monitoring, landings restrictions, and stocking of fish,
   it is hoped that red drum abundance can be increased more rapidly than
   by using traditional management techniques alone.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1982, the Columbia River Treaty tribes (Yakama, Nez Perce,
   Umatilla, and Warm Springs) have proposed the use of hatcheries as a
   tool to recover naturally spawning populations throughout the Columbia
   basin. The Yakama Nation is working with the support of other agencies
   to implement tribal salmon restoration philosophies and proposals in the
   Yakima River basin. Yakima/Klickitat fishery project biologists estimate
   that the Cle Elum supplementation project has boosted populations of
   upper Yakima spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha by about
   90\% in both 2001 and 2002 over what returns would have been without the
   innovative hatchery. With the benefit of added fish from the Cle Elum,
   supplementation project, the spring Chinook redd count in the Teanaway
   River in 2002 was more than five times the highest count in recorded
   history. Yakama Nation efforts to re-establish a sustainable, naturally
   spawning coho salmon O. kisutch population in the Yakima basin have
   resulted in adult coho returns that averaged nearly 5,000 fish from 1998
   to 2001 (an order of magnitude greater than the prior 10-year average),
   including an estimated return of more than 1,500 wild/natural coho to
   the Yakima River basin in 2001. Yakama Nation steelhead O. mykiss kelt
   reconditioning programs have increased the escapement of steelhead to
   spawning grounds in the Yakima basin by 2.4\% for the 2001-2002
   migration and by 7.3\% for the 2002-2003 migration. While it is not yet
   possible to definitively state whether or to what extent the use of
   hatchery reared fish and/or methods has resulted in these successes
   without causing other adverse ecological consequences, intensive
   monitoring and evaluation efforts continue on these projects and formal
   scientific results will be published as definitive results become
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Salmon supplementation aims to integrate the wild and hatchery
   populations by deliberately allowing returning hatchery adults to stray
   to the natural spawning ground and, in some protocols, by taking adults
   of natural spawning origin for hatchery broodstock. If the population
   becomes truly integrated, this puts a different light on concerns about
   effects of ``hatchery{''} fish on ``wild{''} fish because the result
   will just be one population with a common gene pool. In this integrated
   population, the basis for an assessment of the genetic effect would be a
   comparison of the natural spawning performance of the supplemented
   population compared to that of an unsupplemented ``control.{''} Actual,
   experimental supplementation programs have not yet measured the right
   quantities with the right design to provide an empirical assessment.
   Theoretical modeling shows that an integrated breeding program still has
   the potential for domestication selection during the hatchery phase,
   which can reduce the natural spawning performance of the stock relative
   to its presupplementation performance. The models predict that, all
   other things being equal, the erosion of natural spawning performance
   will increase with the frequency of natural spawning by hatchery spawned
   fish and the frequency of hatchery spawned fish in the hatchery
   broodstock. This should put more of a premium on adherence to a definite
   protocol, and on effective monitoring of actual supplementation
   experiments in order to quantify the inherent trade-offs between
   competing adaptations to the life cycle resulting from hatchery spawning
   versus the life cycle resulting from natural spawning.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial disagreement and uncertainty attend the question of whether
   the benefits from supplementing wild populations of anadromous salmonids
   with hatchery fish outweigh the risks. Prudent decisions about
   supplementation are most likely when the suite of potential benefits and
   hazards and the various sources of uncertainty are explicitly
   identified. Models help by indicating the potential consequences of
   various levels of supplementation but perhaps are most valuable for
   showing the limitations of available data and helping design studies and
   monitoring to provide critical data. Information and understanding about
   the issue are deficient. I discuss various benefits, hazards, and
   associated uncertainties for supplementation, and implications for the
   design of monitoring and research. Several studies to reduce uncertainty
   and facilitate prudent supplementation are described and range from
   short-term reductionistic studies that help define the issue or help
   avoid deleterious consequences from supplementation to long-term studies
   (ca. 10 or more Fish generations) that evaluate the net result of
   positive and negative genetic, behavioral, and ecological effects from
   supplementation.}},

Abstract = {{A number of stocks of anadromous salmonids in the Pacific Northwest are
   currently listed by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA
   Fisheries) as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species
   Act (ESA). The ESA recognizes that conservation of listed species may be
   facilitated by artificial propagation, including captive broodstocks,
   while factors impeding population recovery are identified and corrected.
   Captive broodstock programs differ from conventional salmon culture in
   that fish of wild origin are maintained in captivity throughout their
   life to produce offspring for the purpose of supplementing wild
   populations. The relatively short generation time (2-7 years) and
   potential to produce large numbers of offspring (1,500-5,000 eggs per
   female average, depending on the species) make Pacific salmon ideal for
   captive broodstock rearing. However, the technology is not without
   potential complications and risks. The paper presents guidelines to
   ensure a sound basis for implementation of captive broodstocks.
   Considerations must be based on overall knowledge of survival,
   reproductive success, and offspring fitness to accurately determine
   levels of risk in implementing a salmonid captive broodstock program. In
   general, use of captive broodstocks should be restricted to situations
   where the natural population is dangerously close to extinction. Proper
   precautions should be taken to minimize genetic impacts during the
   collection, mating, and rearing of captive broodstocks, as any
   alteration to the original genetic composition of the population in
   captivity may reduce the efficacy of supplementation in rebuilding the
   natural population. Furthermore, liberation of fish from captive
   broodstocks should be consistent with the known behavior of existing
   wild Fish and on whatever knowledge is available of the life history
   characteristics of the wild fish. Because the benefits and risks have
   not been established through long-term monitoring and evaluation,
   captive broodstock development should be considered an experimental
   approach and used with caution.}},

Abstract = {{In 1994, the Kootenai River white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus was
   listed in the United States as an endangered species. Under provisions
   of the Endangered Species Act, a recovery plan was prepared and included
   two main recovery measures: (1) mitigation of spring flows for spawning
   and early life rearing, and (2) implementation of a conservation
   aquaculture and breeding plan to prevent extinction and sustain
   year-classes. The hatchery program was controversial and intended as a
   short-term measure as the flow mitigation strategy for wild fish
   developed. It called for the release each year of up to 1,000 white
   sturgeon from each of 10-12 families. It was believed that the
   mitigation of spring flows from Libby Dam would rapidly bring about
   recovery. However, after 8 years of flow mitigation and intensive
   monitoring and evaluation, it became apparent that recovery needs were
   more complex. Flow releases were not at the expected magnitude and
   habitat issues became a significant concern because the spawning
   location of sturgeon did not appear suitable (silt and sand) for
   adequate survival of eggs and larvae. Recruitment of wild fish was
   extremely low, while survival of hatchery sturgeon was higher than
   expected. Hatchery fish soon became abundant out numbering juvenile wild
   sturgeon by about 400:1. Assessment of sturgeon demographics, with
   extinction risk models, provided evidence that the wild population would
   be extinct within three decades and the population would be comprised
   almost exclusively of hatchery fish. Population projections described a
   significant near-term bottleneck in spawner numbers as the wild
   population diminished but hatchery fish had not yet matured. Managers
   are faced with a contentious dilemma of elevating the importance of the
   hatchery program by taking a higher proportion of the remaining wild
   spawners, escalating the number of hatchery releases, which could result
   in increasing the risk of inbreeding depression, loss of genetic
   diversity, genetic swamping, disease magnification, long term
   domestication, and intraspecific competition with wild recruits,
   compromising recovery. However, without significant hatchery
   intervention, the population could become a museum piece with no
   management options to benefit anglers. There will be disagreements, but
   risks must be considered, and we propose some compromises that may ease
   the intrusion of hatchery fish and provide management options.}},

Abstract = {{Snake River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka were listed as endangered
   in 1991. Prior to listing, a captive broodstock program was initiated to
   prevent species extinction and to begin rebuilding the population.
   Reintroduction plans for captive broodstock progeny have followed a
   ``spread-the-risk{''} philosophy incorporating multiple release
   strategies and lakes. Since 1993, more than 860,000 presmolts, 158,000
   smolts, 325,000 eyed eggs and 880 adults have been reintroduced to the
   habitat. From this production, 312 anadromous sockeye salmon have
   returned to adult trapping facilities in the Sawtooth Valley of Idaho.
   Monitoring and evaluation efforts have focused on maximizing the use of
   limited hatchery-rearing space and on identifying and prioritizing the
   most successful reintroduction strategies. Comparisons of presmolt
   overwinter survival and out-migration success from nursery lakes have
   shown that (1) presmolts released directly to Redfish Lake in October
   have emigrated more successfully than presmolts reared in Redfish Lake
   net pens prior to release, (2) presmolts released directly to Alturas
   and Pettit lakes in October have emigrated more successfully than
   presmolts released directly to takes in July, and (3) presmolts reared
   at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) Sawtooth Fish Hatchery
   emigrated more successfully than presmolts reared at the IDFG Eagle Fish
   Hatchery following July releases to Alturas and Pettit lakes. Presmolts
   that spent one winter in Redfish Lake prior to out-migration were
   interrogated more successfully at lower Snake and Columbia River dams
   than smolts released in the outlet of Redfish Lake. Smolt-to-adult
   return rates for anadromous adults produced by the captive broodstock
   program from 2000 to 2002 varied from 0.6\% for unmarked fish returning
   in 2002 to 0.4\% for a combined smolt and presmolt release group in
   2000. Using captive broodstock techniques, the program has successfully
   prevented the extinction of Snake River sockeye salmon and increased
   Population abundance in the habitat. However, without Substantive
   improvements in smolt-to-adult survival, program efforts will likely be
   insufficient to rebuild the population to self-sustaining levels.}},

Abstract = {{The Puget Sound and Coastal Washington Hatchery Reform Project was
   funded by the U.S. Congress beginning in 1999. It is a systematic,
   science-driven redesign of hatcheries to help recover and conserve
   naturally spawning populations and support sustainable Fisheries. The
   project has three structural components. These components include the
   Hatchery Scientific Review Group (HSRG; independent science), Hatchery
   Reform Coordinating Committee (tribal and agency policy), and
   Facilitation Group (project management and communications). Initial work
   by the HSRG included developing a scientific framework for artificial
   propagation of salmon and steelhead, a benefit/risk assessment tool,
   hatchery operational guidelines, and monitoring and evaluation criteria.
   These tools are being used by the HSRG in a comprehensive
   region-by-region review. During this review, programs were evaluated for
   consistency with established scientific principles and the objectives of
   hatchery reform. The HSRG made more than 1,000 specific program
   recommendations and 17 system-wide recommendations that affect
   management of all programs. These system-wide recommendations fall under
   three ``principles for hatchery reform{''} that include
   ``goal-setting,{''} establishing ``scientific defensibility,{''} and
   employing ``informed decision making{''} in hatchery management. Success
   of the hatchery reform project will be measured through effective
   implementation of these principles and recommendations by the state,
   tribal, and federal comanagers. Implementation thus far by the
   comanagers has included termination of several species-specific
   programs, a hatchery closure, and significant revisions to spawning and
   rearing practice. Plans include removal of hatchery structures that
   impede wild fish passage, comprehensive monitoring and evaluation, and
   hatchery-free steelhead management zones. Recommendations will also be
   incorporated into management plans and staff responsibilities at
   Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and in processes between the
   comanagers such as the Endangered Species Act.}},

Abstract = {{Salmon hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest continue to produce fish for
   harvest, largely to fulfill a mitigation function. Fisheries management
   struggles with the need to integrate this harvest opportunity from
   hatcheries with wild fish conservation. Warm Springs National Fish
   Hatchery demonstrates a program that balances this need to help offset
   salmon losses, provide fisheries, and protect wild fish. The U.S. Fish
   and Wildlife Service and Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs
   Reservation of Oregon initiated the hatchery program in 1978 with wild,
   native fish from the Warm Springs River. The goal is to cooperatively
   manage hatchery operations to balance harvest opportunities with
   protection of wild fish populations and their inherent genetic
   resources. The management objectives are (1) to produce spring Chinook
   salmon Oncorhynchus tshawyischa for harvest in tribal subsistence and
   sport fisheries, (2) to preserve the genetic characteristics of the
   native population both in the hatchery and in the naturally spawning
   component of the integrated population, (3) to manage impact on wild
   fish to levels which pose a minimum risk, and (4) to develop and
   implement a hatchery operations plan to achieve both the harvest and
   conservation goals for the Warm Springs River Chinook population. To
   determine if these objectives are met, data on harvest, escapement,
   recruitment, spawning success, fish health, survival, run timing, age
   and size at return, and juvenile production characteristics have been
   collected to monitor changes over time and to compare performance of
   wild and hatchery origin fish. These data have been cooperatively
   collected by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation,
   Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service for more than 25 years. Every 5 years, a hatchery operation plan
   has been developed based on this monitoring. The following list of
   actions are identified in the 2002-2006 hatchery operations plan and are
   measures for protecting the natural population while operating the
   hatchery for harvest augmentation: (1) Mass marking and coded-wire
   tagging of hatchery production for selective fisheries, broodstock
   management, and hatchery evaluations; (2) Selecting broodstock to mimic

Abstract = {{Artificial propagation is a potential mechanism to aid recovery of U.S.
   Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed stocks of Pacific salmon on the West
   Coast of the United States. Theoretically, one of the fastest ways to
   amplify population numbers for depleted stocks of Pacific salmon is
   through Culture and release of hatchery-propagated fish. However, past
   attempts to use supplementation (i.e., the use of artificial propagation
   in an attempt to maintain or increase natural production) to rebuild
   naturally spawning populations of Pacific salmon have often yielded poor
   results. One solution is to develop protocols that increase fitness of
   hatchery-reared salmonids, thereby improving survival. A framework of
   conservation hatchery strategies to reduce potential impacts of
   artificial propagation on the biology and behavior of fish is presented.
   Operational guidelines for conservation hatcheries to help mitigate the
   unnatural conditioning provided by hatchery rearing are discussed and
   contrasted to those for production hatchery operation. These include (1)
   mating and rearing designs that reduce risk of domestication selection
   and produce minimal genetic divergence of hatchery fish from their wild
   counterparts to maintain long-term adaptive traits; (2) simulation of
   natural rearing conditions through incubation and rearing techniques
   that approximate natural profiles and through increasing habitat
   complexity (e.g., cover, structure, and substrate in rearing vessels) to
   produce fish more wildlike in appearance and with natural behaviors and
   higher survival; (3) conditioning techniques such as antipredator
   conditioning to increase postrelease behavioral fitness; (4) programming
   aspects of release size, stage, and condition to match the wild
   population in order to reduce potential for negative ecological
   interactions and to promote homing; and (5) aggressive monitoring and
   evaluation to determine Success of conservation hatchery approaches.
   High priority must be given to basic scientific research to meet three
   principal goals: (1) maintain genetic integrity of the population, (2)
   increase juvenile quality and behavioral Fitness, and (3) increase adult
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term assessments of ecosystem rehabilitation project effects are
   rare. Herein we describe a study of the Hotophia Creek rehabilitation
   project in northwest Mississippi. The stream channel was subjected to
   channelization ca. 1963 and experienced rapid channel erosion between
   1963 and 1985, with annual suspended sediment yield exceeding 1,000 t
   km(-2). More than \$10 million were expended on erosion control measures
   within the 90-km(2) watershed between 1985 and 2000, with an attendant
   sixfold reduction in suspended sediment yield. Fish and physical aquatic
   habitat data were collected for one year prior to construction of a
   one-km long stream habitat rehabilitation project in 1992. Habitat
   rehabilitation consisted of extending existing stone spurs, placing
   stone toe, and planting willow cuttings. Post construction monitoring
   was conducted for the four years following construction, and at 10 years
   following construction. Parallel monitoring was conducted on an
   untreated reference stream and on untreated reaches upstream on Hotophia
   Creek. Effects of rehabilitation on habitat and fish communities were
   found to be positive in both the short and long term. For example, after
   10 years, mean water depth in the reach subjected to rehabilitation was
   more than twice as great as for untreated reaches upstream. Woody
   riparian vegetation more than doubled and large woody debris density
   increased by an order of magnitude in both treated and untreated
   streams. Fish species richness and numbers were lower after 10 years,
   perhaps due to reduced sampling efficiency associated with greater water
   depth. However, fish populations shifted away from domination by large
   numbers of small, opportunistic generalists and toward dominance by
   large-bodied, pool-dwelling species typical of more pristine streams.
   Prior to rehabilitation, 51\% of the fish captured were cyprinids
   (minnows), while 10 years later 61\% of the fish captured were
   centrarchids (sunfishes).}},

Abstract = {{Mason's Run, in Camden County New Jersey is the only stream that still
   supports a self-sustaining population of eastern brook trout in southern
   New Jersey. Early settlers removed vast acreages of forest cover to
   engage in agriculture more than two hundred years ago, rendering most
   streams incapable of supporting trout. The major mechanisms for this
   loss were sediment loadings and loss of base flows and shade which
   naturally moderated flow and summer water temperatures. With the
   abandonment of farms in the 1940's many areas have grown back into
   forest cover mitigating these past impacts. At the same time
   unprecedented land development for homes, road and businesses has dealt
   another severe blow to streams. In some places there are enough
   mitigating factors to permit the survival and propagation of trout.
   Mason's run in Camden County New Jersey flowing through a large
   (approximately 560 acre) tract of relatively undisturbed land in the
   borough of Pine Hill still hosts a self sustaining population of eastern
   brook trout.
   This paper describes the restoration of Mason's Run which was a part of
   mitigation plan for impacts on wetlands and buffers of a golf course
   construction project. It presents the design approach including the
   techniques for calibrating the design discharge and the use of a
   reference reach to establish the geometry of the channel. The project
   resulted in an increase of trout habitat from 800 feet to more than one
   mile of suitable habitat. Some temperature monitoring data are presented
   showing the impact of the restoration on stream temperatures.}},

   Data loggers have been developed for use with a commercially available

   of time-tagged measurements of electric and magnetic field strength to
   be accrued over extended periods of the working day. The instrumentation
   was worn by workers carrying out tasks representative of some of their
   typical daily activities at a variety of radio sites. The results
   indicated significant differences in the exposures of workers in various
   RF environments. A number of measures of exposure have been examined
   with a view to assessing possible exposure metrics for epidemiological
   studies. There was generally a good correlation between a given measure
   of electric field strength and the same measure of magnetic field
   strength.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium content in male and female workers at the US Department of
   Energy Hanford Site was estimated based on measurements made in 2002 of
   K-40 activity in the body. The K-40 activity in females ranged from 2.1
   to 4.1 kBq with an average of 3.1+/-0.02 kBq. The total body potassium
   (TBK) content in females averaged 98+/-0.6 g. The K-40 activity in males
   ranged from 2.8 to 6.6 kBq with an average of 4.2+/-0.01 kBq and the
   average TBK was 136+/-0.3 g. The average TBK value for males aged 20-49
   y was 140 g. The average TBK values for both genders decreased with age.
   The average potassium concentrations calculated for the different age
   ranges for males were 15-25\% less than the value (1.9 gK per kg)
   obtained using the reported ICRP reference potassium and reference
   weight values. Potassium concentrations were inversely correlated with
   body-build index, body-mass index and body weight. These correlations
   could possibly be utilised to help assess the risk for disease. Future
   work is planned to evaluate whether monitoring of potassium
   concentrations could be used as a tool for the detection of diabetes and
   hypertension.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{Observations are presented on the natural regeneration of Eucalyptus
   victrix L. Johnson and K. Hill (coolibah), the dominant tree species of
   grassy woodlands on the floodplain of the Fortescue River, north of
   Newman in the Pilbara district of Western Australia. The main objectives
   of this study were to examine: (i) survival of newly recruited E.
   victrix seedlings on flooded and burnt sites, and (ii) growth and
   survival of established plants in a gilgaied landscape. Populations of
   newly-recruited seedlings following flooding or fire were monitored
   opportunistically at `Marillana' and `Ethel Creek' stations, for up to
   two years from tagging. A population of saplings at `Roy Hill' station
   was observed over eight years.
   Seedling densities of E. victrix in flooded sites were 0.32 and 1.03
   plants/m(2) in 1995 and 1997 respectively. Locally high densities
   reached from 1.2 to 17.7 plants/m(2) on areas of 28 and 6 m(2)
   respectively. At the burnt site at `Ethel Creek', 1.30 plants/m(2) were
   observed where 58 seedlings were recorded on an area of 445 m(2) a year
   after a natural fire. Many of these persisted well into their second
   year, whereas seedlings recruited in the flooded sites generally lasted
   less than a year (250-376 days). In contrast, persistence of a cohort of
   100 established saplings <2 m tall in a gilgaied landscape at `Roy
   Hill'was high. During 8 years of observations, only one sapling was
   lost. Those found at the edges of gilgais bad attained greater heights
   (3.91 +/- 1.14 m) than saplings located inside (3.16 +/- 0.95 m) or on
   top (3.12 +/- 0.93 m) of the gilgais.
   This study demonstrates that the seedling stage in E. vietrix is
   critical, in that once newly recruited individuals reach the sapling
   stage (0.6-1 m), mortality rates are much reduced. Unfortunately, it was
   not possible during the course of this study to locate a cohort of young
   seedlings that did survive and so any consideration of the conditions
   necessary for their survival is speculative.}},

Abstract = {{The monitoring of short-term changes in structural characteristics of
   forests is important to understand mechanisms of vegetation loss that
   can be associated with deforestation, and illegal logging. These
   changes, however, should be differentiated from variations in vegetation
   activity due to interannual variability. Change detection based on
   thematic information is limited for this purpose because it depends
   highly on classification accuracies, and it does not allow a
   quantitative evaluation of biomass loss. The definition of
   bio-indicators associated with structural characteristics (such as, leaf
   area index, vegetation fraction) is at present, the only way to monitor
   such changes. We developed an evaluation system consisting of 4
   bio-physical variables, estimated from visible red and near-infrared
   observations of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper, to monitor changes in
   forest biomass. The system is based in the application of algorithms to
   estimate leaf area index, the fractional vegetation cover, leaf
   vegetation index, and a sparse vegetation cover index, from
   radiometrically and atmospherically calibrated data. The algorithms were
   applied to individual scene images acquired during the dry season
   (April-May) to maximize the forest vegetation signal, and in order to
   identify areas of change due to changes in forest biomass rather than
   changes in understory vegetation conditions. The change detection
   analysis consisted in comparing pixel-by-pixel scenes of such variables,
   and the results indicated that changes in structural characteristics of
   forest can be monitored with Landsat-7, being leaf area index, and
   fractional vegetation cover the most significant in identifying changes
   along roadsides and population centers that indicate biomass extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing population growth and growing ecological problems in urban
   areas require advanced remote sensing technology for the acquisition of
   detailed and accurate land-use information for urban management and
   planning issues. Surface consumption of 120 ha per day (2003) for
   traffic and settlement areas in Germany is far away from the 30 ha per
   day of the sustainability-strategy intended for the year 2020 by the
   Federal Environmental Ministry. With regard to the 50ies, imperviousness
   and sealing almost doubled. The presented study is embedded in a project
   in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), the most densely populated federal
   state in Germany. During the last decades, industrial transformation
   processes as well as strong economic and socio-structural changes have
   taken place, making NRW most suitable as an exemplary region to study
   and visualize dynamic developments in Europe. The examined time period
   of this work includes intense urban development and expansion in the
   suburban regions. LANDSAT data of three time slices (1975, 1984 \& 2001)
   build the backbone to detect the changes taken place. Applying a
   multisensoral approach with improved spatial and even spectral
   resolution the focus is on the urban development of certain ``hot
   spots{''} in NRW. CORONA, IKONOS as well as ASTER satellite data is used
   to allow a further characterization of urban land-use types and changes
   in more detail over the last four decades. Classical change detection
   methods as PCA are combined with classification of segmented urban
   land-use areas when evaluating the type of change.}},

Abstract = {{Managers require information on the location, extent, density and
   biological characteristics of mimosa, Mimosa pigra L., to plan control
   and mitigation programs. Since the 1980s, numerous techniques have been
   used to map mimosa in the Northern Territory. This paper describes the
   methods and makes suggestions on mapping priorities. No single method is
   ideal. A combination of methods is necessary to most efficiently obtain
   data on mimosa distribution for management. The interpretation of
   satellite imagery has not been successful at mapping mimosa due to the
   variation in environments across its range. The detection of small
   mimosa populations is a key requirement in implementing the Mimosa
   Strategic Plan for Australia. Small infestations are most reliably
   detected by field or aerial surveys and the location recorded with a
   global positioning system device. A limitation of analysing the results
   of these surveys together in a geographic information system is the
   variation in the descriptive information obtained and the manner in
   which it is categorised. Regional monitoring programs comparing a series
   of satellite images over time offer a potentially useful overview of
   mimosa condition or trend, but this is only possible after models have
   been developed and refined by many years of monitoring field sites and
   comparing these to results from satellite image interpretation. The
   value of small-scale mapping to provide an overview of mimosa
   populations and their management has not been realised. Regional mimosa
   status mapping with a combination of existing digital data, supplemented
   with expert knowledge, is a technique that could yield a suite of useful
   maps for managing mimosa. This method should be tested.}},

Abstract = {{Mimosa, Mitmosa pigra L., was first reported in Sri Lanka in 1997. The
   species is mainly confined to the central and north-western provinces of
   Sri Lanka. The plant has colonised along the river banks of the Mahaweli
   River, which is the main supplier of irrigation water to the
   agriculture-dominant dry zone of the country. Use of river sand for
   construction work was identified as a major method of seed dispersal,
   apart from seeds being transported with river water flow. GPS technology
   is currently being used for monitoring the extent of spread of this
   species.
   Mimosa seeds were 100\% viable after four years of storage at room
   temperature (28 +/- 2 degrees C) and also at 8 degrees C. The onset of
   flowers was first observed at 12-14 weeks after planting. The initial
   growth of the weed was slow, but the height increased at a rate of
   2.4-2.6 cm day(-1) during the first 8-12 weeks. From 12 weeks, the stem
   dry weight of mimosa increased at a more rapid rate than the root dry
   weight. The relative growth rate (RGR) increased until onset of flowers
   and then decreased. The soil seed-bank density within the canopy
   diameter of the naturally grown mimosa plants varied from 2,336 to
   46,410 seeds m(-2). Glyphosate at the dosage of 1.44 kg active
   ingredient ha(-1) effectively controlled mimosa seedlings less than six
   months old, when applied three times repeatedly at four-month intervals
   on the same set of seedlings. Mimosa seeds did not germinate in the
   resence of one-month old Panicitin maximum Jacq. at a population density
   of 16 plants m(-2). Awareness programs conducted for the communities in
   the infested areas have resulted in several community participatory
   activities to eradicate small patches of mimosa from the Central
   Province.}},

Abstract = {{This work aimed to establish operative methods for removing
   hardseededness in the viability monitoring tests of the Medicago
   polymorpha and Trifolium subterraneum accessions preserved in the
   Spanish base genebank. The following scarification methods were assayed
   on seeds from one population of each species: immersion in sulfuric
   acid, exposure to liquid nitrogen (LN), seed coat abrasion with sand
   paper, centrifugal stirring of seeds with sand and seed coat burning.
   The most efficient scarification treatments for M. polymorpha were
   immersion in sulfuric acid for 15-30 minutes and seed coat burning. In
   addition to these treatments, immersion in LN after placement at
   -18degreesC and two minutes of centrifugal stirring with sand completely
   removed hardseededness in the T. subterraneum population without causing
   seed damage. LN exposure produced cotyledon breakage in M. polymorpha
   and the stirring treatment had no effect on this species. A number of T.
   subterraneum accessions stored in the CRF genebank were pre-treated by
   centrifugal stirring with sand for two minutes and the remaining hard
   seeds were scarified by seed coat burning. This combination obtained
   good results in the evaluation of seed viability but the effectiveness
   of the pre-treatment varied greatly depending on the population assayed.}},

   breeding program. Only 2.6\% of ramets from 25 breeding clones were
   incorrect whereas 8.4\% of progeny from 10 families were genetically
   incorrect. The lineages of second generation clones were checked for DNA
   profiles that were available for putative parents. Some parents appear
   to be incorrect on the basis of the DNA profiles and further sampling
   will be required to confirm these results across the breeding program.

   stakes. Second, we quantified differences in susceptibility of the 2
   types of stakes by recording their mass losses due to termite feeding.
   The treated stakes had been impregnated with a carbohydrate and protein
   mixture or with a nominal retention concentration of 2.5\% mass/mass
   (m/m) urea or 5.0\% m/m urea in oven-dry (OD) timber.
   In Experiment 1 at Townsville, and in Experiment 2 at Beerburrum, there
   was no significant difference between 20 treated stakes and 20 untreated
   stakes, with respect to the rate of location and feeding by Coptotermes
   acinaciformis (Froggatt) (Experiment 1) and Schedorhinotermes seclusus
   (Hill) and Heterotermes paradoxus (Froggatt) (Experiment 2). In
   Experiment 3 at Beerburrum, C. acinaciformis, S. seclusus and H.
   paradoxus were recorded. While there were no significant differences in
   the rate of location and feeding, with respect to treatments,
   differences in feeding, with respect to C. acinaciformis and S. seclusus
   were significant. C. acinaciformis displayed greater feeding-site
   tenacity than S. seclusus.
   The terminology commonly employed when referring to the management of
   termite populations using baits is discussed briefly. We suggest that
   the term `bait susceptibility' is preferable to `bait palatability'.
   Further, our results suggest that laboratory studies are not a
   definitive measure of the attractiveness of a compound to termites.
   Increased consumption of baits, due to the addition of a phagostimulant,
   needs to be demonstrated in the field before claims can be made of an
   increase in the efficacy of baits in a termite management program.}},

Abstract = {{I conducted a mark-recapture study of Siren lacertina and Amphiuma means
   for one year at a lake in north Florida and documented average
   individual movement, size class distribution, seasonal activity
   patterns, survival rates, and density estimates. I captured Siren
   lacertina more frequently in winter and A. means more frequently in
   spring. Recapture probabilities of both species were low, whereas
   survival rates and density estimates (1.3 salamanders/m(2) for S.
   lacertina, 0.28 salamanders/m(2) for A. means) were high. I recorded no
   individual movement of over 10 m for either species. Sirens and
   amphiumas are large, predatory generalists that can have substantial
   biomass in wetlands (233 g/m(2) and 44 g/m(2), respectively, at this
   study site), and therefore can impact many other wetland species. Thus,
   more attention must be focused on evaluating and monitoring their

Abstract = {{The Nile Monitor (Varanus niloticus), the longest lizard in Africa, was
   first observed in southwestern peninsular Florida in the Cape Coral area
   of Lee County ca. 1990. From April 2001 through 7 July 2003. we compiled
   146 sightings or captures of this species by local residents or
   ourselves. Numerous individuals of all size classes have been observed
   or collected, suggesting the occurrence of a reproducing population.
   Although our records are mostly confined to Cape Coral. our data
   indicate that V. niloticus has recently expanded its range northwards
   and to nearby islands. Because this large lizard has the potential to
   disperse into nearby ecologically sensitive areas and preserves where it
   could pose a serious threat to waterbirds, Burrowing Owls (Athene
   cunicularia), sea turtles, and other native wildlife, population
   monitoring and eradication are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (TSC Act) is unique and
   effective in Australian jurisdictions in recognising threatened
   populations. Section II of the TSC Act provides for the listing of
   endangered populations.There were 28 endangered populations listed under
   the TSC Act (January 2003) for which there were two approved recovery
   plans, one publicly exhibited draft plan and four plans in preparation.
   Monitoring was being undertaken for only six populations. The TSC Act
   would be strengthened by: (i) adding an objective which states that
   recognising threatened entities is fundamental to the legislation; (ii)
   changing the definition of population to make it consistent with IUCN
   terminology; (iii) simplifying Section 11; (iv) better resourcing for
   faster preparation of plans and their implementation; and (v) including
   population monitoring in all recovery plans.The process of saving
   threatened species is occurring at the level of population; for example,
   through priority sites for threat abatement, translocation, replicates
   for research treatments and habitat protection. The objective of
   recognising and the process of listing threatened populations are
   fundamental to sound threatened species legislation.}},

Abstract = {{Mass-based emission controls (such as Euro -I to IV) are successfully
   reducing emissions of fine particles from road vehicles, but may have
   actually increased the emission of ultrafine particles and their
   persistence in the atmosphere just at a time when growing evidence
   indicates that these ultrafine particles present the greatest threat to
   health upon inhalation. These particles have so little mass that they
   barely register in measurements made by the current urban air quality
   monitoring network, which measures the mass of particulate matter
   (PM10). Ultrafine particles also have different dynamic and transport
   properties to larger particles, leading to more variability in
   concentrations that may rise and fall independently of PM10. Current
   daily and hourly monitoring of PM10 for the purposes of Air Quality
   Management fails to represent the wide variation and episodicity in
   exposure of an urban population to the threat from traffic-sourced
   ultrafine particles.
   In order to quantify and interpret this variability, data from
   experiments employing sophisticated, high-resolution instrumentation in
   UK cities will be presented. This data will illustrate the variability
   on time scales from minutes to hours of ultrafine particle exposure on
   busy streets, and will indicate how meteorological factors and urban
   topography determine the exposure to traffic particle emissions in the
   surrounding urban environment. Such information has important
   consequences for the assessment of future emission reduction and air
   quality improvement strategies, especially localised strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of selected nutrient amendments and temperature on the
   biodegradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) within a soil biopile was
   studied on a laboratory scale. This was accomplished by monitoring
   microbial populations, the concentration of PCP and the release of
   inorganic chloride ions in the contaminated soil. It was found that
   temperatures of 10, 15 and 20degreesC had no significant effect on
   microbial populations and the percentage of PCP remaining in the soil.
   However, the nutrient amendments did have a significant effect on the
   parameters measured. The dairy manure, ammonium nitrate fertilizer and
   control treatments all experienced some fluctuations in the amount of
   PCP remaining in the soil over the incubation period and may have been
   due to the release of initially unextractable bound residues. PCP
   decreased by 76\% in the municipal solid waste compost amended soil,
   while the concentration of inorganic chloride ions increased. The
   municipal solid waste compost treatment had significantly higher
   bacterial and fungal populations. Based on the results of this study
   municipal solid waste compost may be used as an effective supplemental
   nutrient amendment for the degradation of PCP in soil biopiles.}},

Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Pages = {{131-139}},
Abstract = {{As pulp and paper wastewaters are mostly deficient in nitrogen and
   phosphorus, historical practice has dictated that they cannot be
   effectively treated using microbiological processes without the addition
   of supplementary nutrients, such as urea and phosphoric acid.
   Supplementation is a difficult step to manage efficiently, requiring
   extensive post-treatment monitoring and some degree of overdosing to
   ensure sufficient nutrient availability under all conditions. As a
   result, treated wastewaters usually contain excess amounts of both
   nutrients, leading to potential impacts on the receiving waters such as
   eutrophication. N-ViroTech(R) is a highly effective alternative
   treatment technology which overcomes this nutrient deficiency/excess
   paradox. The process relies on communities of nitrogen-fixing bacteria,
   which are able to directly fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, thus
   satisfying their cellular nitrogen requirements. The process relies on
   manipulation of growth conditions within the biological system to
   maintain a nitrogen-fixing population whilst achieving target wastewater
   treatment performance. The technology has significant advantages over
   conventional activated sludge operation, including:
   Improved environmental performance. Nutrient loadings in the final
   treated effluent for selected nitrogen and phosphorus species
   (particularly ammonium and orthophosphate) may be reduced by over 90\%
   compared to conventional systems;
   Elimination of nitrogen supplementation, and minimisation of phosphorus
   supplementation, thus achieving significant chemical savings and
   resulting in between 25\% and 35\% savings in operational costs for a
   typical system;
   Self-regulation of nutrient requirements, as the bacteria only use as
   much nitrogen as they require, allowing for substantially less operator
   intervention and monitoring.
   This paper will summarise critical performance outcomes of the
   N-ViroTech(R) process utilising results from laboratory-, pilot-scale
   and recent alpha-adopter, full-scale trials.}},

Abstract = {{The restoration and management of regulated rivers is important for
   sustaining all types of ecosystems across the world. The northern area
   of the Senegal River basin has endured major ecological change after the
   construction of the Diama and Manantali dams. Karibaweed has become a
   major problem in the region. Permanent availability of freshwater in the
   Diama reservoir and the blockage of the seasonal seawater intrusion
   induced the proliferation and the extension of many macrophyte species.
   The abundance and distribution of invasive species and their impacts
   were surveyed in September and October 2002. This monitoring was
   combined with a malacologic survey to establish a correlation between
   the densities of several weed species and mollusk populations. Cattail
   species increased in density between the two surveys. Presence of some
   mollusk species were correlated with water depth and current velocity,
   and others were correlated with abundance of aquatic plants. The
   invasive plants reduced flow of water in the irrigation channels, which
   aggravated the sedimentation process in the infrastructures. The delta
   ecosystem is weakened by the regulated infrastructures, and the
   exploitation of macrophytes has seriously reduced the agricultural
   potential of the region.}},

Abstract = {{Ambiguity exists in the use of the terms ``survey,{''} ``inventory,{''}
   and ``monitoring{''} as related to adaptive weed management.
   Misunderstanding can lead to poor planning and inefficient use of
   limited budgets. Adaptive weed management includes developing an
   objective-based weed management plan, implementing the plan, monitoring
   to measure progress toward objectives, evaluating the plan or practices,
   making any necessary adjustments, and then repeating the cycle.
   Monitoring involves the repeated collection and analysis of
   site-specific data to evaluate progress toward management objectives.
   Surveys and inventories are field searches to determine the location and
   relative abundance of weeds on a landscape scale. Surveys are
   representative samples of an overall weed population, whereas
   inventories attempt to account for all weed infestations or individual
   plants within a specified area. Weed surveys and inventories are as
   basic to preserving land health as medical exams are to maintaining
   human health, and weed maps are as vital to land managers as X-rays are
   to medical professionals. Weed surveys are especially critical for
   success in early detection and rapid response. Area-wide weed surveys or
   inventories should be conducted as part of planning long-term weed
   management strategies and control tactics. Attempts to survey and
   monitor weeds simultaneously can result in data ill suited to the
   objectives.}},

   southern half of Western Australia to monitor the natural arrival, or
   controlled release, of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus ( RHDV).
   Changes in rabbit populations and the immune status of RHDV antibodies
   were monitored in these areas to enable further understanding of the
   epidemiology of RHD, and its impact on rabbit numbers.
   RHDV had the greatest impact on rabbit populations in the arid and
   semi-arid areas (< 360 mm per annum), where rabbit numbers were reduced
   to, and maintained at, 10\% of pre-RHD levels. Conversely, the effects
   of RHD on rabbit numbers in higher-rainfall areas ( 360 - 700 mm per
   annum) were highly variable and patchy, and in some instances RHD had
   little apparent impact. In higher-rainfall areas where RHD was
   effective, rabbit numbers were reduced by 50 - 78\%. RHDV was first
   confirmed in the southern agricultural region of Western Australia in
   early September 1996, \&SIM; 1 year after its escape from Wardang
   Island, South Australia. At the detailed monitoring site ( 485 mm
   rainfall per annum), rabbit numbers declined by 65\% within 2 weeks of
   RHDV being detected. However, \&SIM; 70\% of the remaining rabbits had
   antibodies against RHDV, indicating that they had survived the disease.
   There was also a demographic shift towards young rabbits (< 1 year old)
   at this time. Further, even though there was no clinical evidence of RHD
   recurring in this population during the 3-year study, the presence of
   IgM antibodies in some rabbits well after the initial epizootic suggests
   that low-level transient outbreaks of RHDV had occurred at this site.
   Although the impact of these low-level outbreaks on population dynamics
   were uncertain, rabbit numbers at this site had recovered to pre-RHD
   levels within two breeding seasons.
   The abundance of insect vectors on the detailed monitoring site was
   similar between years with and without RHD outbreaks. Thus, the failure
   of RHDV to develop clinical disease on this site after the initial
   epizootic was unlikely to have been caused by the lack of suitable
   transmission vectors. The apparent lack of disease recurrence at the
   detailed monitoring site may have been caused by the presence of a
   non-pathogenic form of RHDV, which seemed to impart at least some
   cross-immunity to RHDV in these rabbits. The presence of RHDV also
   caused a shift in the timing of natural epizootics of myxomatosis at
   this site.}},

Abstract = {{Sooty shearwaters (titi, muttonbird, Puffinus griseus) are highly
   abundant migratory seabirds, which return to breeding colonies in New
   Zealand. The Rakiura Maori annual chick harvest on islands adjacent to
   Rakiura ( Stewart Island), is one of the last large-scale customary uses
   of native wildlife in New Zealand. This study aimed to establish whether
   the rate at which muttonbirders can extract chicks from their breeding
   burrows indicates population trends of sooty shearwaters. Harvest rates
   increased slightly with increasing chick densities on Putauhinu Island.
   Birders' harvest rates vary in their sensitivities to changing chick
   density. Therefore a monitoring panel requires careful screening to
   ensure that harvest rates of the birders selected are sensitive to chick
   density, and represents a cross-section of different islands. Though
   harvest rates can provide only a general index of population change, it
   can provide an inexpensive and feasible way to measure population
   trends. Detecting trends is the first step to assessing the long-term
   sustainability of the harvest.}},

   possums in New Zealand}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{397-401}},
Abstract = {{Population monitoring of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) is an
   essential part of their management in New Zealand, with a trap-catch
   removal method being used most commonly. An alternative monitoring
   method (bait-interference), using bite marks on wax blocks, has been
   promoted as a more cost-effective alternative to using traps. However,
   neither of these methods has been validated. We assessed the utility of
   these two methods regarding their accuracy ( unbiasedness and precision)
   in detecting changes in possum abundance by comparing the estimates of
   relative change in possum density following control obtained from both
   methods with the kill rate among radio-collared possums in the same
   study areas. In each of seven control operations, 48 - 50 possums were
   collared with mortality-sensing radio-transmitters, and trap-catch and
   wax-block lines were assessed before and after control. The correlation
   between trap-catch and radio-transmitter kill estimates (R-2 = 0.91)
   suggests that trap catch, as currently used to monitor relative possum
   abundance, appears to be sufficiently accurate to manage these pests,
   with any bias being small. The kill estimates based on the wax-block
   monitoring were correlated less strongly with the radiotransmitter
   estimates than the trap-catch estimates (R-2 = 0.66), although still
   significant. Until the extent of the potential bias in the wax-block
   estimates is known, we recommend that traps continue to be used as the
   main method to monitor possum abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers and managers commonly use catch rates on trap-transects as
   an index of abundance for trappable wildlife species. We describe a
   method whereby the data collected from such surveys can be further
   analysed to obtain information on the patchiness of the trapped species'
   distribution on those transects. For certain applications, such as the
   management of wildlife disease, the index is likely to have significant
   advantages over traditional indices of spatial aggregation. One such
   situation is the management of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula)
   in New Zealand to inhibit the spread of bovine tuberculosis within their
   populations. Trap-catch data from a possum survey are used to illustrate
   the proposed method, and the potential for application of such
   monitoring to wildlife populations is discussed.}},

Title = {{Effect of sample age and season of collection on the reliability of
   microsatellite genotyping of faecal DNA}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{485-493}},
Abstract = {{Individual identification of animals from DNA in field-collected faecal
   samples is becoming an increasingly important tool in wildlife
   population monitoring. A major issue relevant to the application of this
   technique is the reliability of the genotypes obtained. I investigated
   the effect of sample age and season of collection on amplification rates
   and reliability of microsatellite genotypes amplified from faecal DNA of
   a marsupial herbivore, the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale
   penicillata) and a eutherian carnivore, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).
   Comparison of DNA profiles from 1 day to 6 months for both species
   suggests that as the age of the faeces increases there is less
   good-quality DNA present on the surface of the faeces, resulting in
   significantly decreasing amplification rates and increasing genotyping
   error rates over time. No microsatellite PCR products were obtained from
   samples older than 3 months from any faecal DNA extract in either
   season. For both species, faeces collected during the summer trial
   yielded high-quality DNA for up to one week. Faeces collected in winter
   had significantly lower amplification rates and higher genotyping errors
   than the summer-collected samples. Computer simulations were used to
   estimate the probability of obtaining false genotypes when genotyping
   faecal samples of various ages. These revealed that three replicates is
   sufficient to prevent identification of false individuals for P.
   penicillata from faeces up to one week old in both summer and winter but
   more replicates may be required for older samples, particularly in
   winter. In contrast, up to eight replicates may be required for fox
   faeces collected in winter, particularly if more than one week old.
   These results also suggest that it is difficult to visually identify
   faecal age for V. vulpes, and any study using fox faeces would need to
   account for the likely inclusion of older faeces in a field collection.
   For P. penicillata, faecal age could be accurately assessed,
   particularly when less than one week old and targeting faeces that match
   the two most reliable appearance classes described here would be an
   efficient sampling strategy. It is recommended that the appropriate PCR
   replication protocol for any given study should be tailored to the error
   rates expected for the oldest samples likely to be collected. This study
   is the first to thoroughly investigate the effects of sample age and
   season of collection on microsatellite genotyping from faecal samples
   and provides guidelines for sampling and PCR repetition strategies for
   field-based non-invasive DNA studies.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{535-541}},
Abstract = {{Although plastic and metallic leg bands are widely used for identifying
   individual birds to assist population monitoring, the health risks
   associated with banding are quantified relatively rarely. We recorded
   the general occurrence of foot and leg injuries during a four-year study
   of the North Island robin (Petroica longipes) and assessed the
   probability of banding - injury relationships. While most leg problems
   were not obviously related to banding ( transient lameness, congenital
   deformity, infection, fracture), on 10 occasions individuals experienced
   lameness or injury directly because of the presence of bands (similar to
   2.5\% of individuals per year). In eight of these instances, individual
   robins caught their back toe ( hallux) in between a band and their
   tarsus. This resulted in an inability to place the affected foot on the
   ground, and in some cases a pedal injury. We believe that this
   previously undescribed toe entrapment is made possible because of the
   robin's sideways perching behaviour on upright vegetation. This
   highlights that relationships between leg banding and injury may be
   species-specific and that the impacts of banding should be identified
   and quantified in all species in which it is used. This will allow more
   accurate assessments of the risks and benefits associated with this
   common marking technique.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},

Pages = {{551-558}},
Abstract = {{Population estimation and monitoring is a fundamental component in the
   conservation management of any species. For species such as flying-foxes
   (Pteropus spp.) population estimation is complicated by the large number
   of animals involved, their mobility and the conditions under which
   counts are conducted. Because count results are used in the
   determination of management requirements, they are the focus of much
   critical attention. Despite this, while measures of the precision of
   fly-out counts of Pteropus spp. have been published, measures of their
   accuracy have not. In this paper we present an assessment of the
   accuracy and precision of observer counts of dusk fly-outs by comparing
   recordings of observers' counts with a video of the same fly-out.
   Observer's counts were significantly related to the video-count (r(s) =
   0.69, P < 0.0001), with the average observer's count underestimating the
   video-count by 14.7\% (+/- 25, s.d.) of the video-count. Observers'
   errors increased with the rate at which flying-foxes left the camp and
   with the width of the fly-out stream. These results suggest that while
   observers' errors are inherent in dusk fly-out counts, these errors are
   manageable and relatively predictable. Other sources of error are likely
   to have a greater impact on the final population estimate at both camp
   and regional scales.}},

Title = {{The terrestrial vertebrate fauna of Litchfield National Park, Northern
   Territory: monitoring over a 6-year period and response to fire history}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{587-596}},
Abstract = {{Forty-seven 50 m x 50 m quadrats were sampled systematically for
   vertebrates at Litchfield National Park, northern Australia, in both
   1995-96 and 2001-02. A total of 184 vertebrate species was recorded from
   this sampling, of which 92 species were recorded from five or more
   quadrats. There was substantial change in the reported species
   composition of these quadrats between these two periods: the mean
   Bray-Curtis index for similarity in species composition from the
   baseline to subsequent sampling of a quadrat was only 22.1 (for an index
   that varies from 0 for complete turnover in species to 100 for unchanged
   composition). For individual species, correlations across quadrats in
   the abundance scores from baseline to resampling varied from -0.12 to
   0.85. Matched-pairs testing showed that there was significant change in
   abundance for 18 species from the baseline to repeat sampling, and
   significant increase in total bird species richness and total native
   mammal abundance, but significant decrease in reptile species richness.
   Fire history was recorded biannually for 40 of the 47 quadrats. Fire was
   very frequent, with quadrats being burnt in an average of 3.65 years of
   the six years between fauna samples. Three aspects of this fire history
   (total number of years of fires, number of fires in the late dry season,
   and interval from the last fire to the date of resampling) were related
   to change in the fauna composition of quadrats. Neither the similarity
   in species composition, nor change in richness or total abundance of all
   vertebrates or of the four taxonomic classes considered (frogs,
   reptiles, birds and mammals) were significantly correlated with these
   components of the fire history of sampled quadrats. This lack of
   association was possibly because the monitoring period was too short to
   show pronounced directional change, because the system was responding to
   many factors other than fire, because the variations in abundance were
   too large and the number of samples too small to detect true
   associations, or because fire histories preceding baseline sampling were
   not considered.
   The apparent instability of fauna species and communities in this system
   provides a considerable challenge for broad-brush (that is, vertebrate
   community-wide) monitoring. Power analysis demonstrated that, for most
   species, more than 1000 sample sites are needed to be 90\% certain of
   detecting a 20\% change in abundance, and with a 10\% chance of
   accepting a Type I error. This level of sampling effort is commensurate
   with the current level of vertebrate sampling in this region.
   Broad-brush monitoring approaches such as described here are valuable,
   but need also to be complemented by more targetted monitoring for
   individual threatened species or species of particular management
   interest.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of behavioral factors influencing reproductive success and
   failure in captive giant pandas}},
Journal = {{ZOO BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{15-31}},
Abstract = {{The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) breeding center in Wolong,
   China, has experienced a recent dramatic increase in reproduction, with
   the population nearly tripling in the past 7 years. Much of this success
   comes from the development of behavioral management strategies, guided
   by the application of scientific knowledge. Here we present statistics
   that illuminate where reproductive problems have occurred, and discuss
   remedial actions taken with individual animals. During each year of this
   study (1996-2000), 93\% of the females experienced estrus, 72\%
   copulated, and 51\% gave birth. Two-thirds of the males mated each year.
   Most instances of mating failure were attributed to male behavior. In
   nearly half of mating failures, the male mounted but did not copulate.
   In about one-third of mating failures, the male lacked sexual
   motivation, and showed excessive aggression 20\% of the time. The males
   varied, and some were more likely to show interest in estrous females in
   neighboring enclosures and/or mate successfully during introductions.
   Copulation time was unrelated to reproductive success, but more
   insemination events (matings and artificial inseminations (AIs)
   combined) may be related to twinning. We suspect that temperament,
   stress, and husbandry practices play a role in isolated cases of
   reproductive failure in females, both pre- and postcopulation. Pregnancy
   or conception failure occurred in 35\% of females inseminated naturally
   or through artificial insemination (AI). Behavioral management at Wolong
   is holistic and emphasizes biological relevance, including enrichment
   and well-being, intensive monitoring of signs of estrus, and male-female
   familiarization and olfactory communication during the mating season.

Abstract = {{The Asian and African elephant populations in North America are not
   self-sustaining, and reproductive rates remain low. One problem
   identified from routine progestagen analyses is that some elephant
   females do not exhibit normal ovarian cycles. To better understand the
   extent of this problem, the Elephant TAG/SSP conducted a survey to
   determine the reproductive status of the captive population based on
   hormone and ultrasound evaluations. The survey response rates for
   facilities with Asian and African elephants were 81\% and 71\%,
   respectively, for the studbook populations, and nearly 100\% for the SSP
   facilities. Of the elephants surveyed, 49\% of Asian and 62\% of African
   elephant females were being monitored for ovarian cyclicity via serum or
   urinary progestagen analyses on a weekly basis. Of these, 14\% of Asian
   and 29\% of African elephants either were not cycling at all or
   exhibited irregular cycles. For both species, ovarian inactivity was
   more prevalent in the older age categories (> 30 years); however,
   acyclicity was found in all age groups of African elephants. Fewer
   elephant females (similar to30\%) had been examined by transrectal
   ultrasound to assess reproductive-tract integrity, and corresponding
   hormonal data were available for about three-quarters of these females.
   Within this subset, most (similar to75\%) cycling females had normal
   reproductive-tract morphologies, whereas at least 70\% of noncycling
   females exhibited some type of ovarian or uterine pathology. In summary,
   the survey results suggest that ovarian inactivity is a significant
   reproductive problem for elephants held in zoos, especially African
   elephants. To increase the fecundity of captive elephants, females
   should be bred at a young age, before reproductive pathologies occur.
   However, a significant number of older Asian elephants are still not
   being reproductively monitored. More significantly, many prime
   reproductive-age (10-30 years) African females are not being monitored.
   This lack of information makes it difficult to determine what factors
   affect the reproductive health of elephants, and to develop mitigating
   treatments to reinitiate reproductive cyclicity. (C) 2004 whey-Liss,

Abstract = {{We monitored nest sites of endangered Interior Least Terns on a 5 095 ha
   alkaline flat in north-central Oklahoma, USA. After nest loss, Least
   Terns commonly renested And experienced 30\% apparent nest success in
   1995-1996 (n = 233 nests). Nest success and predation differed by
   location on the alkaline flat in 1995 and overall, but nest success and
   flooding did not differ by microhabitat type. Predation was highest at
   nests: 5 cm from debris (driftwood/hay) in 1995. No differences in
   nesting success, flooding, or predation were observed on comparing nests
   inside, and outside electrified enclosures. Coyotes and Striped Skunks
   were confirmed nest predators, and Ring-billed Gulls were suspected nest
   predators. We identified one location on the alkaline flat of about 1000
   ha with consistently lower nest losses attributable to flooding and
   predation and the highest hatching success compared with other parts of
   the alkaline flat, it was typified by open ground and bisected by
   several creeks. Management activities that minimize flooding and
   predation in this area could further enhance nest success and
   theoretically increase overall productivity of this population of Least
   Terns. However, the efficacy of electrified enclosures and nest-site
   enhancements, as currently undertaken, is questionable because of
   considerable annual variation in use by and protection of Least Terns.}},

Title = {{Assessing village authenticity with satellite images: A method to
   identify intact cultural landscapes in Europe}},

Abstract = {{The village with its characteristic zones of different land use from the
   center to the periphery is a basic unit of Europe's cultural landscapes.
   However, loss of the authentic pre-industrial village structure
   characterized by a fine-grained structure of arable land and wooded
   grasslands is a threat to both cultural heritage and biodiversity in
   many rural landscapes. Therefore, it is important that the extent and
   rate of change of such authentic villages in a landscape can be
   monitored. We studied to what extent loss of authenticity with
   increasing time after abandonment can be assessed by quantitative
   analysis and visual interpretation of satellite images. The study was
   carried out in the Bieszczady Mountains, SE Poland in 1999. Using
   Landsat Thematic Mapper data from 1998, both the grain size of landscape
   elements (size of fields) and land-cover composition (encroachment of
   shrub and forest) were quantitatively described 6 type villages
   representing different stages of deterioration of the authentic village
   structure. Historical maps were used to delineate the border of the
   villages and the former extension of forest and open land was measured.
   The present land use and the degree of abandonment expressed as grain
   size and forest encroachment were mapped using satellite data.
   Deterioration occurred along 2 transformation paths: abandonment and
   ultimately becoming forest, or intensified agriculture, respectively. To
   validate these results we classified 22 other villages in a 1000 km(2)
   area by visual interpretation of the original satellite images into 1 of
   4 types. We then collected historical data on human population changes
   over the past six decades. The classification of village authenticity
   was clearly related to the rate of human population decline. We address
   the importance of validating and applying this approach for rapid
   assessment of the authenticity of cultural landscapes in European
   regions being subject to ongoing as well as expected future change,
   related to expansion of the European Union. Finally, we argue that the
   village represents a scale at which integration of natural and social
   sciences is possible.}},

Abstract = {{Although the `Economic Injury Level' (EIL) concept belongs to the
   keystones of IPM theory, its applicability to all pest problems is
   believed not to he universal. Current IPM theory claims that the EIL
   concept is of limited use (i) in situations where an. injury-damage
   function cannot be established, (ii) if pest monitoring is impossible or
   EIL is very low, and (iii) with preventive measures of pests;and
   pathogens. In this work, I argue that the two latter points may. not be
   true. First, within IPM all types of chemical treatment, including
   preventive ones, should be economically justified via calculation of
   EIL, based on the comparison of the cost of preventive and responsive
   control measures and the cost of the forecasted/expected damage. The
   `expected' damage should be based on long-term (historical) damage
   records, manipulative experiments, risk assessment and biomathematical
   modelling of the evaluated pathosystem. Second, the absence of EIL in
   `preventively controlled pests' hampers completion of the consistent
   Stern-Pedigo's classification of pest organisms according to mutual
   position of EIL and General Equilibrium Position (GEP) or Stationary
   Distribution of Population Densities (SDPD).}},

Abstract = {{Alaska has two polar bear populations: the Southern Beaufort Sea
   population, shared with Canada, and the Chukchi/Bering Seas population,
   shared with Russia. Currently a reliable population estimate for the
   Chukchi/Bering Seas population does not exist. Land-based aerial and
   mark-recapture population surveys may not be possible in the Chukchi Sea
   because variable ice conditions, the limited range of helicopters,
   extremely large polar bear home ranges, and severe weather conditions
   may limit access to remote areas. Thus line-transect aerial surveys from
   icebreakers may be the best available tool to monitor this polar bear
   stock. In August 2000, a line-transect survey was conducted in the
   eastern Chukchi Sea and western Beaufort Sea from helicopters based on a
   U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker under the ``Ship of Opportunity{''} program.
   The objectives of this pilot study were to estimate polar bear density
   in the eastern Chukchi and western Beaufort Seas and to assess the
   logistical feasibility of using ship-based aerial surveys to-develop
   polar bear population estimates. Twenty-nine polar bears in 25 groups
   were sighted on 94 transects (8257 km). The density of bears was
   estimated as I bear per 147 km(2) (CV = 38\%). Additional aerial surveys
   in late fall, using dedicated icebreakers, would be required to achieve
   the number of sightings, survey effort, coverage, and precision needed

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of cover reduction on the mulgara,
   Dasycercus cristicauda, a small marsupial classified as vulnerable to
   extinction, which occurs in areas of central Australia dominated by
   hummock grasslands. Loss or degradation of spinifex has been implicated
   in population declines of this species previously, but the importance of
   cover in maintaining quality habitat remains speculative. To determine
   the effect on D. cristicauda of cover reduction, caused by the
   harvesting of spinifex, we monitored population changes and changes in
   prey resources (rodents and invertebrates) before and after spinifex
   harvesting took place at a site near the Ayers Rock Resort, Northern
   Territory, Australia. Ten plots, each of 8.75 ha, were established and
   sampled from May 1994 to October 1995. Harvesting took place on five
   plots in August 1994, which reduced spinifex cover from 46 to 21\% and
   the amount of spinifex >0.25 m high from 42 to 2\%. Harvesting did not
   significantly affect the number of D. cristicauda known to be alive or
   captured despite other studies indicating that cover is an important
   habitat attribute. There was also no evidence that cover reduction
   impacted on the biomass of the invertebrate food resources. However,
   there was a significant reduction in the number of rodents captured. The
   lack of a response to cover reduction by D. cristicauda is possibly
   because the cover of Triodia remained high enough (above 15\%) to
   sustain animals, and harvested areas were relatively small. This study
   therefore suggests that D. cristicauda can tolerate a moderate local
   reduction in cover of its preferred habitat. However, it remains
   possible that other land use practices that cause severe reduction of
   cover (including clearing for mining or fire prevention, grazing which
   may result in spinifex reduction through trampling, and fire management)
   will have more dramatic effects on D. cristicauda. Evaluation of such
   effects should be a priority for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Growth rates of branches of colonies of the gorgonian Pseudopterogorgia
   elisabethae were monitored for 2 years on a reef at San Salvador Island,
   Bahamas. Images of 261 colonies were made at 6-month intervals and
   colony and branch growth analyzed. Branch growth rates differed between
   colonies and between the time intervals in which the measurements were
   made. Colonies developed a plumelike morphology through a pattern of
   branch origination and determinate growth in which branch growth rates
   were greatest at the time the branch originated and branches seldom grew
   beyond a length of 8 cm. A small number of branches had greater growth
   rates, did not stop growing, and were sites for the origination of
   subsequent ``generations{''} of branches. The rate of branch origination
   decreased with each generation of branching, and branch growth rates
   were lower on larger colonies, leading to determinate colony growth.
   Although colonial invertebrates like P. elisabethae grow through the
   addition of polyps, branches behave as modules with determinate growth.
   Colony form and size is generated by the iterative addition of branches.}},

Abstract = {{Rumex rothschildianus (Polygonaceae) is a small dioecious annual endemic
   to the central coastal plain of Israel. This very rare sorrel is on the
   verge of global extinction, as its total gene pool consists of two
   surviving populations only: one small and the other relatively large and
   flourishing. The other ten populations of this species recorded during
   the 20th century (all in Israel) are now extinct. Amplified fragment
   length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to evaluate the population
   genetic structure of the two remaining populations. Genetic diversity in
   R. rothschildianus was H = 0.17 with 48.9\% polymorphic loci. Gene flow
   values suggest that the differentiation between the two populations is
   moderate (mean F-st = 0.09). Considering these genetic data, two
   conservation management strategies should be applied: (1) Large scale
   reseeding in a neighbouring nature reserve to maintain the genetic
   diversity detected in this study. Seeds from diverse sources should be
   used for repeated reseedings in order to prevent the reintroduced
   populations from going through a genetic bottleneck or suffering genetic
   drift. (2) To maintain the genetic diversity in the two remaining wild
   populations, and to avoid risks such as possible outbreeding depression,
   only intrapopulation reinforcement should be considered. These
   populations should be carefully monitored and protected. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The Namibian cheetah population has recently undergone serious decline
   due to human-mediated removals, and investigating the rates and causes
   of such removals is an important aspect of the future management of
   cheetah populations outside protected areas. We examined cheetahs that
   were reported live-trapped or killed on Namibian farmlands between 1991
   and 1999. A perceived threat to livestock or game led to the vast
   majority of live captures and to almost half of the cheetah deaths
   investigated. Despite this, livestock predation from cheetahs appeared
   to be minimal, and was usually perpetrated by cheetahs with injuries.
   Most of the cheetahs were trapped in groups, and cheetahs' relative
   sociality leads to the easy removal of entire social units. Long-term
   monitoring must include detailed consideration of these indiscriminate
   removals, as they involve many cheetahs, fluctuate between years, often
   go unreported, and are likely to have a serious impact on cheetah
   populations outside protected areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Methods to evaluate population trends have recently received particular
   attention because of perceived declines in several species during the
   20th century. We investigated whether age at first breeding could be
   used as an ``early warning signal{''} to detect possible changes in
   population trends in long-lived species with deferred maturity using
   data from the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) population in
   Donana National Park (Spain). This bird of prey is an endangered species
   that has suffered a rapid decline in this population during the last 10
   years. As a result of our 27-year monitoring (1976-2002) study, we
   detected that an increase in immature breeding birds occurred before
   population decline became evident. The proportion of immature-plumaged
   breeders in the population was significantly higher during the period of
   decline than during the period of stability. In our case, more than 10\%
   of immature breeders can be considered as an ``early warning signal{''}
   that anticipates population decline. Owing to the ignorance of this
   warning signal, urgent actions for the recovery of this eagle population
   started 10 years later than necessary, and when population size had been
   reduced. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate the potential effects of herbicide quinclorac
   (3,7-dichloro-8-quinolinecarboxylic) on the culturable microorganisms in
   flooded paddy soil. Methods Total soil aerobic bacteria, actinomycetes
   and fungi were counted by a 10-fold serial dilution plate technique.
   Numbers of anaerobic fermentative bacteria (AFB), denitrifying bacteria
   (DNB) and hydrogen-producing acetogenic bacteria (HPAB) were numerated
   by three-tube anaerobic most-probable-number (MPN) methods with
   anaerobic liquid enrichment media. The number of methanogenic bacteria
   (MB) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) was determined by the rolling
   tube method in triplicate. Soil respiration was monitored by a 1026-type
   gas chromatography with a stainless steel column filled with GDX-104 and
   a thermal conductivity detector. Results Quinclorac concentration was an
   important factor affecting the populations of various culturable
   microorganisms. There were some significant differences in the aerobic
   heterotrophic bacteria. AFB and DNB between soils were supplemented with
   quinclorac and non-quinclorac at the early stage of incubation, but none
   of them was persistent. The number of fungi and DNB was increased in
   soil samples treated by lower than 1.33 mug.g(-1) dried soil, while the
   CFU of fungi and HPAB was inhibited in soil samples treated by higher
   than 1.33 mug.g(-1) dried soil. The population of actinomycete declined
   in negative proportion to the concentrations of quinclorac applied after
   4 days. However, application of quinclorac greatly stimulated the growth
   of AFB and NFB. MB was more sensitive to quinclorac than the others, and
   the three soil samples with concentrations higher than 1 mug.g(-1) dried
   soil declined significantly to less than 40\% of that in the control,
   but the number of samples with lower concentrations of quinclorac was
   nearly equal to that in the control at the end of experiments.
   Conclusion Quinclorac is safe to the soil microorganisms when applied at
   normal concentrations (0.67 mug.g(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{Mean cladoceran body length of 59 northeastern U.S. lakes was estimated
   from functional groups that broadly define taxonomic, body size, and
   grazing potential. Multiple regression of body length, color, and
   chlorophyll a or total phosphorus against Secchi disk transparency
   explained 72\% and 83\% of the variation across lakes, respectively.
   Analysis that included body length, color, and particulate carbon, a
   proxy for light backscattering and absorption by suspended organic
   particles, explained 85\% of the variance in transparency. Body length
   was as important a predictor of water clarity as chemical factors.
   Furthermore, body length was significantly correlated to temporal
   variation in transparency within lakes. Because cladocerans primarily
   filter organic particles in size ranges having high light attenuation
   efficiencies, body length was consistently more strongly correlated to
   transparency than to chlorophyll a. Monitoring cladoceran body length
   should help to distinguish changes in lake transparency due to nutrient
   loading from changes that reflect fish population size structure and
   predation intensity on zooplankton. This simple size index can greatly
   increase the interpretative value of Secchi transparency observations to
   lake managers.}},

Abstract = {{Vestigial first toes (dewclaws) on the hind legs are common in large dog
   (Canis lupus familiaris) breeds but are absent in wild canids, including
   wolves (Canis lupus). Based on observational criteria, dewclaws in
   wolves have been generally regarded as a clue of hybridization with
   dogs, although this was not substantiated by molecular evidence. By
   means of population assignment and genetic admixture analysis, we
   investigated individual genotypes of three dewclawed wolves from Tuscany
   (central Italy, 1993-2001). Based on 18 microsatellite markers,
   dewelawed wolves were not uniquely assigned to the Italian wolf
   population but appeared to be second or later generation backcrosses of
   wolf-dog hybrids. Alleles uniquely shared with dogs, and mitochondrial
   DNA and Y haplotypes identical to those of Italian wolves, further
   supported their admixed ancestry. Although patterns of dewclaw
   inheritance in wolfdog hybrids and backcrosses have not been
   ascertained, we concluoe that dewclaws in wolves, when present, are a
   clue of admixed ancestry, probably originating in areas where. large dog
   breeds are involved in cross-matings. Other ``atypical{''} morphological
   traits (e.g., white nails, atypical color patterns or body proportions,
   dental anomalies) as well might be reliable clues of admixed ancestry,
   and they deserve careful monitoring and molecular investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Most large carnivore species are in global decline. Conflict with local
   people, particularly over depredation on livestock, is a major cause of
   this decline, affecting both nominally protected populations and those
   outside protected areas. For this reason, techniques that can resolve
   conflicts between large carnivores and livestock farmers may make
   important contributions to conservation. We monitored rates of livestock
   depredation by lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus),
   cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and spotted hyenas(Crocuta crocuta), and
   retributive killing of these species by farmers in livestock-producing
   areas of Laikipia District, Kenya. Farmers killed more lions, leopards,
   and spotted hyenas where these predators killed more livestock.
   Livestock husbandry had a clear effect on rates of depredation and hence
   on the numbers of predators killed. Cattle, sheep, and goats experienced
   the lowest predation rates when attentively herded by day and enclosed
   in traditional corrals (bomas) by night. Construction of the boma, the
   presence of watchdogs, and high levels of human activity around the boma
   were all associated with lower losses to predators. Although most of
   this work was carried out on commercial ranches, local Maasai and
   Samburu pastoralists have practiced nearly identical forms of husbandry
   for generations. Our study shows that traditional, low-tech husbandry
   approaches can make an important contribution to the conservation of
   large carnivores.}},

Title = {{Demographic viability of a relict population of the critically
   endangered plant Borderea chouardii}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{In addition to human-caused changes in the environment, natural
   stochasticity may threaten species persistence, and its impact must be
   taken into account when priorities are established and management plans
   are designed. Borderea chouardii is a Tertiary relict at risk of
   extinction that occurs in only one location in the world, where the
   probability of human disturbance is low. Its persistence, therefore, is
   mainly linked to its response to natural threats such as stochasticity.
   Over 8 years I monitored up to 25\% of this rupicolous small geophyte.
   The population had an unbalanced size structure and 90\% failure in seed
   arrival at appropriate microhabitats, which suggests a problem with
   recruitment. I used matrix models to describe its population dynamics,
   conducted hand sowings, and performed stochastic simulations to
   investigate the effect of environmental stochasticity on population
   trend and viability. I modeled several scenarios to represent a variety
   of ecological situations, such as population reduction, episodic or
   persistent disease, and enhancement or decrease of recruitment.
   Population growth rate (lambda) was never significantly different from
   unity over the study period. The risk of extinction was null over the
   next five centuries under current conditions. Increase of mortality and
   decrease of recruitment reduced stochastic population growth rate, but
   no factor except a persistent increase of 10\% mortality resulted in
   extinction. These results are the consequence of the plant's extremely
   long life span (over 300 years) and low temporal variability of key
   vital rates. Even though hand sowing significantly increased the
   stochastic population growth rate, other approaches may be more
   important for the persistence of this species. The extremely slow
   capacity for recovery following disturbances renders habitat
   preservation essential. In addition, the founding of new populations
   would reduce the risk associated with habitat destruction.}},

Abstract = {{A delayed response to change is often a characteristic of long-lived
   species and presents a major challenge to monitoring their status.
   However, rapid shifts in age structure can occur even while population
   size remains relatively static. We used time-varying matrix models to
   study age-structure information as a tool for improving detection of
   survivorship and fecundity change and status. We applied the methods to
   Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), a long-lived endangered marine
   mammal found throughout the North Pacific Rim. Population and newborn
   counts were supplemented with information on the fraction of the
   population that was juvenile, obtained by measuring animals in aerial
   photographs taken during range-wide censuses. By fitting the model to
   1976-1998 data, we obtained maximum-likelihood estimates and 95\%
   confidence intervals for juvenile survivorship, adult survivorship, and
   adult fecundity in the mid-1980s, late 1980s, and 1990s. We used a
   series of nested models to test whether the data were best fit by a
   model with one, two, or three temporal changes in demographic rates, and
   we fit the models to different lengths of data to test the number of
   years of data needed to detect a demographic change. The declines in the
   early 1980s were associated with severely low juvenile survivorship,
   whereas declines in the 1990s were associated with disproportionately
   low fecundity. We repeated these analyses, fitting only to the count
   data without the juvenile-fraction information, to determine whether the
   age-structure information changed the conclusions and/or changed the
   certainty and speed with which demographic-rate changes could be
   detected. The juvenile-fraction data substantially improved the degree
   to which estimates from the model were consistent with field data and
   significantly improved the speed and certainty with which changes in
   demographic rates were detected.}},

Abstract = {{Although deforestation and habitat loss are considered the main causes
   of wildlife depletion, the bushmeat trade is one of the foremost threats
   to biodiversity conservation in central Africa. In 1997 and 1998, we set
   up a bushmeat trade monitoring program in the town of Gamba to assess
   the pressure exerted on wildlife by the human population attracted by
   the oil industry in the Gamba Protected Areas Complex. During 279 days
   of observations, we recorded 19 mammal species, 4 bird species, and 7
   reptile taxa, for a total of 2845 animal carcasses with an estimated
   weight of 189,728 kg. Even though the bushmeat trade is illegal in
   protected areas, calculation of annual production levels and hunting
   yields showed that this trade is not sustainable for some species. We
   calculated the ratio of bushmeat found in the markets of Gamba to the
   human population. Compared with other Gabonese towns, Gamba had the
   highest ratio in the country. We suggest that the oil industry is
   another contributor to the bushmeat crisis in central Africa. It is
   important to recognize the role of oil companies in the current crisis
   in order to heighten the awareness of the public and of oil companies
   and to seek ways of lessening the impact of the oil industry on the
   bushmeat trade in central Africa.}},

Abstract = {{We used data from a statewide frog monitoring network to investigate
   population turnover and synchrony in eight wetland-breeding species. We
   found that subpopulations at many sites turn over frequently, with
   breeding choruses absent or undetectable in most years. Frequencies of
   detection across sites were significantly associated with the density of
   wetland patches (all species) and the areal extent of several
   terrestrial land cover categories (seven species) within 1 km.
   Intraspecific population fluctuations were statistically synchronized
   between survey sites separated by up to 50-100 km, but synchrony was not
   strong. Anuran abundances were significantly correlated with rainfall
   1-4 years earlier, indicating that rainfall influences population
   fluctuations. However, population synchrony was much weaker than
   rainfall synchrony. Managers attempting to maintain amphibian
   populations regionally should focus on maintaining landscapes with high
   densities of wetlands and sufficient upland habitat resources. The
   dynamic nature of amphibian populations at individual wetlands is well
   known, and our results suggest that species distributions at the
   landscape level are similarly dynamic.}},

Abstract = {{American Peregrine Falcons in California (Falco peregrinus anatum) have
   been managed in one of the largest reintroduction programs in the
   history of endangered species management. However, as for most other
   widespread natural populations, the spatial and temporal dynamics of
   California Peregrines have remained poorly understood. Longterm
   monitoring data on this highly managed species present a unique
   opportunity for retrospective analysis of the factors contributing to
   the successful recovery of Peregrine Falcons in California, as well as
   demographic differences between habitat types. We used a newly developed
   mark-recapture model (the Barker model), which allows the simultaneous
   use of recaptures, dead recoveries, and live resightings, to provide
   estimates of first-year, second-year, and adult survival of Peregrine
   Falcons in the mid- and south-coast regions of California. Annual
   survival rates for second-year and adult Peregrines were estimated at
   86\%. Through model fitting, we show positive effects of urban habitats
   on first-year survival. In our best-fit models, first-year birds fledged
   in urban areas had a survival rate of 65\%, whereas rural (non-urban)
   first-year survival was only 28\%. The introduction method also
   influenced first-year survival after dispersal; in rural areas,
   estimated survival of hacked young (after independence) was lower than
   estimated survival of wild-reared young. We also show that birds in
   urban habitats have significantly higher fecundity rates than birds in
   rural habitats, even though the fecundity of rural breeders has
   increased significantly over the last two decades. We argue that the
   strong habitat differences in first-year survival combined with lower
   fecundity rates in rural habitats (due to slower improvement in eggshell
   thinning rates) facilitates spatial structuring of the California
   Peregrine population. Matrix population models constructed for both
   rural and urban habitats support this assessment. The temporally
   averaged population growth rate in urban habitats was estimated as
   lambda = 1.28, compared to lambda = 0.99 in rural habitats. Yearly
   analytical lambda values in rural habitat predict declining population
   growth (lambda < 1) throughout the 1980s and increasing population
   growth (lambda > 1) in the 1990s due to improved reproductive
   performance. These results indicate that the introduction effort was
   pivotal in recovering the rural, population in this portion of. its
   former habitat, because intrinsic growth rates alone would have been
   insufficient to yield the observed population recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Social and density-dependent life history processes may differ according
   to age and the reproductive history of individuals. Arvicoline rodents
   have a typical, season-dependent, bimodal, age distribution of breeding
   individuals within a population. This distribution may influence
   population fluctuations. In this study, we measured effects of
   interspecific competition from field voles (Microtus agrestis) on
   various fitness components of female bank voles (Clethrionomys
   glareolus) in an age-structured breeding population in large (0.25 ha)
   outdoor enclosures. We monitored survival, reproduction, and space use
   of experimental bank vole populations with females from two different
   age groups. Within the enclosures we manipulated the presence and
   absence of field voles. When coexisting with field voles, the year-born
   bank vole females had lower survival rates than the over-wintered ones
   did. Home ranges of bank voles were smaller in the presence of field
   voles than in their absence. Characteristics of litters of breeding
   females were not affected by the competition treatment. Reproduction of
   the youngest of the year-born females stopped earlier in the season than
   for over-wintered females although both age groups had reproduced prior
   to the trial. We did not observe indications of senescence, such as
   lower reproduction or survival of the over-wintered females in late
   summer. An earlier cessation of breeding in the younger females suggests
   an age-specific trade-off of summer reproduction and winter. survival
   for parous females. Inter- and intraspecific competition seemed to work
   additively on the year-born, females through direct interference. By
   selectively reducing survival of younger breeders, interspecific
   competition could influence age distribution and population growth of
   breeders toward the end of the breeding season. Because old,
   over-wintered females are not surviving to the next noribreeding season,
   the lower survival of young breeders through interspecific competition
   might impact greatly the structure of the breeding population at the
   start of the next breeding season, thus altering population growth
   patterns.}},

Title = {{Temporal variation in survival of mammals: A case of environmental
   canalization?}},

Abstract = {{In an age- or stage- structured population, a given change on a
   proportional scale of different fitness components has different effects
   on the population growth rate. Because earlier studies have shown that
   variability is selectively disadvantageous for long-lived iteroparous
   species, fitness components whose variation has greatest impact on the
   population growth rate are expected to be canalized against temporal
   variability. We present here a test for such a canalization of fitness
   components most influential for population growth. If canalization
   occurs, (1) within a given population the variance of canalized fitness
   components should be less than that of noncanalized components, and (2)
   among populations an inverse relationship should occur between the
   potential demographic impact of fitness components and their temporal
   variability. We tested these hypotheses using data on age-dependent
   survival of ungulates. As expected for long-lived vertebrates,
   elasticities and sensitivities of adult survival were consistently
   higher than for juvenile survival. In support of the canalization
   hypothesis, the variance of juvenile survival with low potential
   demographic impact on fitness was consistently higher than the variance
   of adult survival with high potential demographic impact on fitness, in
   all of 22 ungulate populations for which long-term demographic
   monitoring data were available. However, a negative co-variation between
   potential impact on fitness and temporal variation could also be
   accounted for by alternative hypotheses, the lower resistance of growing
   individuals to environmental ``insults,{''} or reduced adult phenotypic
   variability due to selective mortality of juveniles. To differentiate
   between canalization of adult survival and frailty/selective mortality
   of juveniles, we included five populations of small mammals. We then
   found a negative relationship between the relative potential impact of
   age-dependent survival on fitness and the relative variability of
   age-dependent survival, especially for populations faced with high
   environmental variation. This remained true after correcting for
   differences in mean survival of juveniles and adults and was independent
   of phylogeny. Although more data are required to extend the hypothesis
   to other taxonomic groups, we conclude that available data support the

Abstract = {{Technological advances in the biological sciences have led to a growing
   realization of the inherent complexity of the toxic actions of man-made
   chemicals and industrial compounds. An organism's response to toxic
   exposure is often a complex summation of the individual responses of
   various different cell types, tissues, and organs within an individual.
   Furthermore, within a population, various factors including gender, age,
   fitness, exposure history, genetic variation, and developmental stage
   significantly affect how each individual will react following exposure.
   Because of this complexity, characterizing the responses of organisms to
   environmental toxin exposure is an area of research well suited to the
   utilization of the gene-expression profiling capability of DNA
   microarrays. Microarrays are capable of screening large numbers of genes
   for response to environmental exposure, with the resulting genesets
   comprising de facto biomarkers for such exposures. In many cases, the
   genesets described contain response transcripts anticipated from known
   mechanistic pathways, but in other cases, equally indicative biomarkers
   may be found that are unexpected. We investigated the response of
   zebrafish embryos exposed in vitro to the environmental contaminant
   4-nonylphenol (4NP). Nonylphenol is one of several alkylphenol
   ethoxylate compounds widely used in agricultural and industrial
   processes that have become ubiquitous environmental contaminants. By
   combining data from differing levels of exposure, we have identified a
   group of genes that appear indicative of embryo exposure to 4NP at
   concentrations ranging from high near-lethal levels to lower, more
   environmentally relevant levels. These biomarker sets can be further
   expanded and adapted for use in environmental monitoring as well as in
   mechanistic studies of complex toxicological mechanisms during both
   early and adult developmental stages.}},

Abstract = {{Feral swine (Sus scrofa) adversely affect the environment in many of the
   places where they have been introduced. Such is the case in Florida, but
   quantification and economic evaluation of the damage can provide
   objective bases for developing strategies to protect habitats. Swine
   damage to native wet pine-flatwoods at three state parks in Florida was
   monitored from winter 2002 to winter 2003. Economic valuations of damage
   were based on the US dollar amounts that wetland regulators have allowed
   permit applicants to spend in attempts to replace lost resources. The
   parks had different swine management histories and the damage patterns
   differed among them over time. Swine were intensively removed in 2000
   from the first park, and it initially had the lowest habitat damage at
   1.3\%, but as a result of natural and artificial population growth this
   damage rose to 5.4\% by the conclusion of the study, and was valued at
   USS 19 193-36 498 ha(-1). The second park had no history of swine
   harvest and, over the monitoring period, damage escalated from
   2.6\%-6.4\%, with an associated value of US\$ 22 747-43 257 ha(-1).
   Swine were managed as game animals in the third park prior to its
   inclusion into the state parks system in 2000. Within this park, the
   proportion of area damaged decreased from 4.3\%-1.5\%, valued at
   US\$5331-10138 ha(-1). This decrease may be a result of human activities
   associated with development of the park's infrastructure causing
   dispersal of animals conditioned to avoid humans by hunting. Damage was
   highly scattered in each park, as evidenced by a much higher proportion
   of sampling sites showing damage than the actual proportion of land area
   damaged. The dispersed nature of small amounts of damage would increase
   the effort required to recover habitat and thus damage value estimates
   are probably conservative. It was also impossible to incorporate values
   for such contingencies as swine impact to state and federally listed
   endangered plants in the parks, some of which are found nowhere else in
   the world.}},

Abstract = {{We measured significant variation in the instantaneous growth rates for
   varroa mites, Varroa destructor (Anderson \& Trueman) from 1993 to 2002
   in Baton Rouge, LA. Mite population growth was monitored in colonies of
   honey bees, Apis mellifera L., with queens from miscellaneous U.S.
   sources that had not been selectively bred for varroa resistance. Mite
   populations were measured at the beginning and end of short field tests
   that started in the late spring of each year. Analyses of multiple
   regression showed that only the first two of the following regressors
   were linear predictors of r, the instantaneous growth rate: 1)
   percentage of reproducing female mites, 2) proportion of total mites in
   capped brood, 3) mortality of mites in brood cells, 4) growth of the bee
   population, 5) capped brood area at the end of a test, and 6) duration
   of the test. Analysis of commonality indicated that the percentage of
   reproducing female mites explained approximate to26\% of the total
   variation in r, and the proportion of total mites in capped brood
   explained 6\%. The joint expression of both variables accounted for
   another 4\%. Thus, residual error reflected most of the total variation
   in r, which suggested possible climatic or environmental effects on mite
   growth. The lowest growth rates occurred in three consecutive years of
   drought in Louisiana. Measures of ambient temperature and relative
   humidity correlated to growth of mite populations among different years.
   Reduced growth rates were probably the result of diminished reproductive
   rates by varroa mites during periods of hot and dry weather.}},

Abstract = {{The capital city of Botswana, Gaborone, has seen unprecedented
   population, economic, and industrial growth in recent years. In order to
   assess how this rapid urbanisation process impacts the environment, 106
   silt and clay (particle size < 0.053 mm) samples, separated from
   Gaborone surface soil samples representing urban, agricultural and rural
   sites, were investigated. The concentrations of nine heavy metals (Sc,
   Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Nb, Cd, and Pb) were measured using ICPMS and GFAAS,
   and the resulting patterns were correlated to the bedrock composition
   and anthropogenic activities. As expected, we found that samples from
   soils on top of dolerites show higher levels of Cr, Ni, and Cu than
   those on top of granites and rhyolites. However, our studies also show
   that Gaborone city centre soils are moderately polluted by Pb (up to 222
   mg/kg, i.e. 5.7-fold the concentration in comparable rural soils), as a
   result of heavy traffic. Furthermore, Cr and Ni pollution originating
   from agrochemicals were shown to be accumulating in Gaborone crop soils.
   Our studies also showed moderate levels of Zn pollution and low level,
   dot-shaped pollution of Cr, Co, Ni, Cu detected in Gaborone residential
   and industrial soils that are correlated to waste disposal.
   Interestingly, the highest levels of Sc, Cr, Co, Ni and Zn pollution are
   found near two abandoned sewage works. The results of sequential
   extraction indicate that the polluting Co and Ni exist in all
   speciations; the polluting Cu mainly exists in the residue of the
   sequential extraction, whereas the polluting Pb is mostly bound to
   organic matters and Fe- and Mn-oxides. These results highlight the need
   for instituting a systematic and continuous monitoring of heavy metals
   and other forms of pollutants in Gaborone to ensure that pollution does
   not become a serious problem in the future.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a larger survey on cumulative effects within the Saint John
   River basin (Canada), a fish survey was conducted near Edmundston (NB,
   Canada) in the fall of 1999 using slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) and
   white Sucker (Catostomus commersoni). The discharge environment receives
   effluent from the Pulp mill. a paper mill, three sewage discharges, and
   tributaries receiving agricultural runoff. Sculpin collected downstream
   of the sewage discharges and pulp mill effluent had greater growth,
   condition, and liver size but no significant differences in gonad size.
   Stable isotope data indicated slimy sculpin did not move between sites.
   Female Sculpin collected downstream of the paper mill showed no
   significant differences in length, body weight, age, condition factor.
   liver size, and gonad size compared to fish from reference sites. Female
   white sucker collected downstream of the pulp mill did not differ
   significantly in any measured parameter compared to reference fish.
   Liver sizes of white sucker from the Saint John River were Outside the
   range considered to be indicative of uncontaminated riverine sites. In
   2000. sculpin collected downstream from a poultry-processing facility
   had larger livers and lower condition factors. suggesting that the site
   is contaminated. We found no significant differences in sculpin length.
   weight. condition (except for males), and liver size in sculpin
   collected downstream from the pulp mill in October 2001. The responses
   of slimy sculpin and white sucker differed, perhaps in relation to
   differences in life history characteristics. Results from this study
   indicate the slimy sculpin is a suitable fish species for monitoring
   rivers that receive multiple industrial and municipal effluents.}},

Abstract = {{Yellow perch captured downstream of a bleached sulfite mill had reduced
   gonad size and fecundity, and circulating steroid levels declined in
   goldfish exposed to final effluent for 21 d. To assess bleached sulfite
   mill (BSM) effluent, long-term fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)
   growth and reproduction tests were carried Out in a flow-through
   bioassay trailer at the mill secondary treatment lagoons. Fertilized P.
   promelas eggs were hatched in effluent (0, 1, 3.2, 10. 32, 50, and 100\%
   final effluent with 10 ng/L ethinylestradiol as a positive control
   compound) and monitored through to 30, 60, and 125 d posthatch. The
   effluent caused a significant increase in the growth of fish this effect
   was evident within 30 d. Fish had changes in secondary sex
   characteristics at Maturity: Male fish had ovipositors in effluent
   concentrations as low as 3.2\%. Higher effluent concentrations
   (32-100\%) resulted in a majority of fish that looked externally like
   females. Changes in external sex characteristics were the most sensitive
   endocrine disruption-specific endpoints and required four months of
   exposure. Exposure to low BSM effluent concentrations (3.2\%) resulted
   in female fish that had male sex characteristics (tubercles and dorsal
   fin dots). This masculinization of female fish was statistically
   significant at 10\% effluent and was not seen in control fish.
   Concentrations of final effluent in the Saint John River (Canada) range
   from less than 1\% to 15\%, depending on the season and river flow. The
   research assesses some of the changes seen in fathead minnows exposed to
   this complex effluent, and demonstrates a threshold of <10\% BSM
   effluent for the most sensitive effects.}},

Abstract = {{Caging and a mark-recapture design were used to estimate the growth rate
   of the brittle, infaunal bivalve Soletellina alba in the Hopkins River
   estuary. The growth of both caged and uncaged individuals was monitored
   at three sites near the mouth of the estuary over 180 days. Growth rates
   did not differ for caged and uncaged bivalves, or for bivalves subject
   to different amounts of handling, or between sites. Growth did differ
   between consecutive time intervals, which was attributable to negligible
   growth occurring during the colder months of autumn/winter. Comparisons
   of the condition (as indicated by total mass for length) of S. alba were
   inconsistent between sites for caged and uncaged bivalves and for those
   subject to different amounts of handling. Soletellina alba is a rapidly
   growing bivalve with mean growth rates for the three time intervals
   being 0.04 +/- 0.002 mm day(-1) in summer, 0.02 +/- 0.001 mm day(-1) in
   autumn and 0.03 +/- 0.001 mm day(-1) from summer to winter. Using
   existing literature, it was shown that a significant relationship exists
   between maximum shell length and onset of sexual maturity in bivalve
   molluscs. This relationship predicts that S. alba should reach the onset
   of sexual maturity at 15.8 mm length. Therefore, it appears that it may
   be possible for juvenile S. alba (<1 mm) to grow, reach sexual maturity
   and reproduce in between annual mass-mortality events caused by winter
   flooding. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several laboratory studies of malaria parasites (Plasmodium sp.) and
   some field observations suggest that parasite virulence, defined as the
   harm a parasite causes to its vertebrate host, is positively correlated
   with transmission. Given this advantage, what limits the continual
   evolution of higher parasite virulence? One possibility is that while
   more virulent strains are more infectious, they are also more lethal to
   mosquitoes. In this study, we tested whether the virulence of the rodent
   malaria parasite P. chabaudi in the laboratory mouse was correlated with
   the fitness of mosquitoes it subsequently infected. Mice were infected
   with one of seven genetically distinct clones of P. chabaudi that differ
   in virulence. Weight loss and anemia in infected mice were monitored for
   16-17 days before Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were allowed to take a
   blood meat from them. Infection virulence in mice was positively
   correlated with transmission to mosquitoes (infection rate) and weakly
   associated with parasite burden (number of oocysts). Mosquito survival
   fell with increasing oocyst burden, but there was no overall
   statistically significant relationship between virulence in mice and
   mosquito mortality. Thus, there was no evidence that more virulent
   strains are more lethal to mosquitoes. Both vector survival and
   fecundity depended on parasite clone, and contrary to expectations,
   mosquitoes fed on infections more virulent to mice were more fecund. The
   strong parasite genetic effects associated with both fecundity and
   survival suggests that vector fitness could be an important selective
   agent shaping malaria population genetics and the evolution of
   phenotypes such as virulence in the vector.}},

Abstract = {{Haliotid (abalone) fisheries are comprised of small-scale (<5 km(2))
   stocks and serve as a model for many such fisheries. Extremely valuable
   to local fishing communities in aggregate, these micro-stocks are myriad
   and complex to study, monitor, assess and manage. Micro-stocks need
   assessment and management at local scales to prevent small components
   from suffering the tragedy of commons. This paper asks how can we ever
   hope to address the research and management needs of so many small
   resources? Community-based and territorial rights-based systems may help
   in sustaining these resources, but servicing the technical needs of many
   small communities of stakeholders raises problems. A new generation of
   `barefoot ecologists' is envisaged to perform this task.}},

Abstract = {{The European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.), has a complex life history and
   many aspects of the biology and population dynamics of this species
   remain unknown or, at best, poorly understood. Relatively little is also
   known about the status of the stocks and fisheries, but available data
   suggest that recruitment of glass eels has been falling for the last 20
   years and is at historically low levels. Yellow and silver eel catches
   have also been falling in many parts of the species range over a similar
   time-scale. Re-examination of the principles applied to fisheries
   management over recent years has resulted in the adoption of a
   `precautionary approach' to the conservation, management and
   exploitation of fish stocks, and in an explicit need to take account of
   uncertainties in management to reduce risks to stocks and their
   environment. Such an approach is highly relevant to the management of
   the European eel and requires that urgent consideration is given to
   harvest strategies and decision structures for the national and
   international management of stocks and fisheries. Provisional biological
   reference levels should be established to provide an equable assessment
   of the status of stocks in all parts of Europe and to evaluate the need
   for management measures in all fisheries. These will need to be reviewed
   as further information comes available. Monitoring and research on eel
   stocks should therefore be enhanced and co-ordinated to improve our
   understanding of the status of stocks throughout Europe and the biology
   of the species.}},

Abstract = {{GBR-prawn is a ``mass-balance{''} trophic-based ecosystem model (ECOPATH
   II) of the Great Barrier Reef, which combines a model template of a
   generalised coral reef ecosystem with results from extensive cross-shelf
   surveys of the far northern Great Barrier Reef. The enhanced model
   includes both the trawl and line fisheries, but focuses on the effect of
   trawling on the penaeid prawn community in the lagoon and inter-reef
   habitat. Trawl and line-fishing by-catch is specified and monitored, as
   is the biomass of seabirds and endangered sea turtles. Network analysis
   of the mixed trophic impacts predicted by the model showed only a minor
   negative impact on prawn populations by trawling. The balance of
   positive effects, such as removal of predators or competitors as
   by-catch, and the negative effects of direct harvest resulted in the
   apparent minor impact. The impact was also reduced by positive feedback
   from the discarded trawl by-catch, currently a 6:1 ratio by weight,
   which either made up a proportion of the prawn diet or was consumed by
   animals that made up a proportion of the diet of the prawns being
   harvested. Dynamic and spatial simulations of the model showed that
   species of prawn were effected differentially, with P esculentus (tiger
   prawn) a dominant at low levels of trawling effort and M. endeavouri
   (endeavour prawn) a better per-former at higher levels of trawling.
   Penaeus longistylus (reef-associated, red-spot king prawn) did poorly
   when trawled unless a refugia was available. The management strategy of
   gradual reduction in trawl 25 effort to 50\% of current levels resulted
   in a 59\% reduction in P esculentus and a 64\% reduction in M.
   endeavouri catch. Catch of P longistylus was also lower than expected
   due to a spatial concentration of the reduced effort in the more
   economically attractive inshore lagoon. The effect on by-catch species
   of reduced trawl effort included increases in sea turtles and small fish
   omnivores (the latter comprising most of the discards), but also
   resulted in a decrease in species that feed on discards such as
   seabirds, groupers, and sharks/rays. Spatial analysis of trawling
   effort, which included the de-facto provision of refugia areas, showed a
   marked buffering of the impacts of trawling on by-catch species,
   particularly sea turtles. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) has become an invasive pest of Opuntia spp.
   along the coastal areas of southeastern United States from the panhandle
   of Florida to South Carolina. Spread of this insect into cactus
   dominated natural areas of the United States and Mexico and into
   agricultural opuntia fields of Mexico is raising concerns within
   international governments and conservation organizations. Interest is
   growing in using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) to manage C.
   cactorum populations. Information on courtship and mating behaviors of
   this insect is important in the development and application of SIT. We
   conducted mating table studies and determined that this moth exhibits
   simple rather than elaborate mating behaviors and that courtship and
   mating take place briefly during morning twilight. Typically, females
   initiate calling, males respond to females, and copulation are complete
   before sunrise. Successfully mated females attract males within a short
   period (mean of 5.2 min), while unsuccessful females continue calling
   for about 40 minutes. Mating pairs remain in copula for a mean of 31.8
   min. Generally, mated females are busy ovipositing the first few nights
   after mating, not exhibiting additional mating behaviors. A release of
   marked males revealed that males stay near the release site and can be
   recovered and identified for subsequent population estimate studies.
   This study on courtship/mating behavior is helpful to the ongoing C.
   cactorum research to develop a successful SIT program, identify the
   female calling pheromone, improve monitoring traps, and develop a
   technique to estimate adult moth population abundance.}},

Abstract = {{1. The timing of reproduction was investigated in six Scottish
   freshwater pearl mussel populations from 1993 to 2002. Gravid females
   were examined and the release of mussel larvae (glochidia) was
   monitored.
   2. Annual spawning (oviposition) and spat (glochidial release) events
   occurred during June to July and June to September, respectively.
   3. Between-river differences in timing seem to be related to water
   temperature. Mussels in the warmest rivers tend to spawn and spat first,
   and vice-versa.
   4. Thermal variations also seem to influence the timing of reproduction
   within rivers, which can be delayed by several weeks during cold years.
   At least 3000degrees-days occur between annual episodes of glochidial
   release.
   5. The timing of spawning is determined gradually, probably by a thermal
   summation effect.
   6. The release stage occurs as a sudden, synchronised event, with most
   of the glochidia spat over 1-2 days, indicating that it is triggered by
   an environmental cue. Sudden changes in water temperature and/or river
   level often result in spats, and the underlying mechanism may be
   respiratory.}},

Abstract = {{1. The pattern of responses of adult trees of Mountain Birch (Betula
   pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) to an outbreak of a folivorous insect
   (Epirrita autumnata) causing approximate to90\% defoliation was studied
   over 8 years in a subarctic area in northern Sweden.
   2. Tree recovery was monitored in terms of the numbers, area, mass and
   nitrogen content of leaves, the numbers of leaf-carrying long and short
   shoots, and the widths of annual tree rings in stems.
   3. The most prominent characteristic of defoliated trees was a threefold
   increase in the proportion of long shoots 1 year after defoliation.
   These shoots subsequently produced many new leaf-carrying short shoots,
   resulting in shoot populations approximate to50\% larger than those of
   control trees. Thereafter the most strongly defoliated trees showed
   decreasing leaf area.
   4. Defoliated trees produced more female catkins but fewer male catkins
   than control trees.
   5. Released apical dominance did not result in any overcompensation in
   terms of growth or leaf area production. However, it presumably
   increased the rate of recovery from herbivory. For the most strongly
   defoliated trees, the benefits from increased production of long shoots
   was not sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale ecological surveillance data were analysed to determine the
   locations of apparent eutrophication effects across common British
   vegetation types between 1990 and 1998. Plant species composition was
   recorded from a total of 9514 fixed plots located in a stratified,
   random sample of 501 1 km squares across Britain. Changes in plant
   species composition along a gradient of substrate fertility were
   inferred from statistical tests of change in mean Ellenberg fertility
   value calculated for each fixed plot. Plots were grouped by eight
   vegetation types, five landscape features (hedges, road verges,
   watercourse banks, small biotopes, larger units in fields and unenclosed
   land) and six environmental zones. Tests of change in mean Ellenberg
   value were carried out on all combinations of these strata. Decision
   tree modelling was used to identify groups of test outcomes sharing the
   same direction of change and where each group was defined by a minimum
   number of strata. Post hoc power analysis was used to select
   statistically non-significant test outcomes that could be used to infer
   stability in the sampled sub-population.
   Out of a total of 142 tests of change in fertility value, 67\% were
   increases, 8\% were reductions and 25\% indicated stability. The best
   overall predictor of increases in fertility value, and therefore of
   shifts in favour of plants suited to higher substrate fertility, was
   vegetation type. Irrespective of landscape feature and environmental
   zone, increased means were associated with infertile grasslands,
   moorland, upland woodlands and heath/bog. Already highly fertile
   grasslands and woodland assemblages in lowland Britain remained largely
   stable. The small number of decreasing test outcomes were associated
   with arable land in Scotland, Wales and western England. These patterns
   of change are hypothesized to reflect pervasive land-use drivers
   combined with the inherent responsiveness of the vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to estimate the daily exposure to lead due
   to food ingestion, air inhalation, and soil ingestion in the Republic of
   Korea's general population, and to evaluate the level of risk associated
   with the current lead exposure level using the proportional daily dose
   (3-4 mug/kg body weight/day) corresponding to the Provisional Tolerable
   Weekly Intake (PTWI) suggested by the Joint FAO/WFIO Expert Committee on
   Food Additives as the toxicological tolerance level. The estimation of
   the daily exposure to lead via three pathways including food, soil
   ingestion and air inhalation was conducted as a chronic exposure
   assessment. For the lead exposure assessment through dietary intake,
   1,389 lead residue data for 45 commodities investigated by the Korea
   Food and Drug Administration during the period 19952000 were utilized
   (KFDA 1996,1997,1998). Six hundred seventy-two air monitoring data from
   7 major cities during the period 1993-2000 and 4,500 soil residue data
   at 1,500 sites during the period 1999-2001 were considered for the lead
   exposure assessment involving air inhalation and soil ingestion,
   respectively. The total daily exposure to lead was estimated by
   combining dietary intake, inhaled amount and soil intake corresponding
   to the typical activity of the general population, which was treated as
   a group of adults with a body weight of 60 kg. For risk
   characterization, the daily exposure to lead was compared with the
   toxicological tolerance level. The level of risk due to lead exposure
   was calculated using the hazard ratio (HR). The dietary intake of lead
   was 9.71 x 10(-4) mg/kg/day and the total daily exposure level,
   including air inhalation and soil ingestion, was 9.97 x 10(-4)
   mg/kg/day. The exposure contributions of foods, air and soil induced
   from the percentage of each media to the total daily exposure were
   97.4\%, 2.1\% and 0.5\%, respectively. Of the different commodity
   groups, the highest contribution to the total exposure came from grain,
   which represented 47.7\% of the total. Additional exposure to lead
   occurs in certain population groups due to the use of tobacco, alcoholic
   beverages, and the intake of other foods, all factors not considered in
   this study. Through the comparison of the daily exposure to lead with
   the tolerance level based on the PTWI, the hazard ratio was estimated as
   being 0.25-0.33. This value implies that no increase in blood lead level
   is to be expected in the general population at the current lead exposure
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{The fish rotan (Perccottus glenii Dybowski) was accidentally introduced
   into European Russia from the Amur River basin. Rotan is capable of
   colonising small waterbodies - favourable breeding sites of native
   amphibians. To reveal its influence on the native aquatic fauna,
   monitoring of small waterbodies has been carried out since 1994 in the
   region of Lake Glubokoe Reserve (Moscow Province, Russia). The fish's
   diet includes a wide range of animal species of all trophic levels.
   Rotan considerably decreases the species richness of aquatic macro
   invertebrates and larval amphibians. As a rule, most amphibian species
   (Triturus cristatus, T vulgaris, Rana temporaria, R. arvalis, R.
   lessonae) and the fish Carassius carassius failed to breed successfully
   in ponds inhabited by rotan. In contrast, the toad Bufo bufo bred
   successfully in such sites because its larvae are distasteful to rotan.
   Rotan-amphibian interactions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We present an application of Bayesian hierarchical modelling of
   stock-recruitment (SR) relationships aiming at estimating Biological
   Reference Points (BRP) for European Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   stocks. The structure of the hierarchical SR model developed
   distinguishes two nested levels of randomness, within-river and between
   rivers. It is an extension of the classical Ricker model, where the
   parameters of the Ricker function are assumed to be different between
   rivers, but drawn from a common probability distribution conditionally
   on two covariates: river size and latitude. The output of ultimate
   interest is the posterior predictive distribution of the SR parameters
   and their associated BRP for a new river with no SR data.
   The flexible framework of the Bayesian hierarchical SR analysis is a
   step towards making the most comprehensive use of detailed stock
   monitoring programs for improving management advice. Posterior
   predictive inferences may be imprecise due to the relative paucity of
   information introduced in the analysis compared to the variability of
   the stochastic process modeled. Even in such cases, direct extrapolation
   of results from local data-rich stocks should be dismissed as it can
   lead to a major underestimation of our uncertainty about management
   parameters in sparse-data situations. The aggregation of several stocks
   under a regional complex improves the precision of the posterior
   predictive inferences. When several stocks are managed jointly, even
   imprecise knowledge about each component of the aggregate can be
   valuable. The introduction of covariates to explain between stock
   variations provides a significant gain in the precision of the posterior
   predictive inferences. Because we must be able to measure the covariates
   for all the stocks of interest, i.e. mostly sparse-data cases, the
   number of covariates which can be used in practice is limited. The
   definition of the assemblage of stocks which we model as exchangeable
   units, conditionally on the covariates, remains the most influential
   choice to be made when attempting to transfer information from data-rich
   to sparse-data situations. (C) 2003 International Council for the

Abstract = {{Grey seal pup production on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, has been
   monitored since the early 1960s. We estimated pup production on Sable
   Island in 1997 using aerial photography with a correction for detection
   of pups on the imagery and a statistical model to account for the
   proportion of pups not born at the time of the survey. A total of 20 863
   pups were counted on the colour positives. When corrected for the
   proportion of pups seen on the imagery (0.96) and the proportion of pups
   born before the survey (east colony 0.94, west colony 0.66), estimated
   total pup production was 25 400 with approximate 95\% confidence limits
   of 23 500 and 26 900. The 1997 estimate indicates that pup production in
   this population, now the largest grey seal colony in the world, has been
   increasing exponentially at an annual rate of 12.8\% for four decades in
   the face of considerable environmental variability. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effect of bacterial physiology, such as
   physiological age and stress, on the performance of the ultraviolet
   aerodynamic particle sizer (UV-APS, model 3312, TSI Inc., St. Paul,
   NfN). Intensity of the fluorescent signals was measured for three
   bacteria having various sensitivities to environmental stresses,
   Bacillus subtilus (spores and vegetative cells), Pseudomonas
   fluorescens, and Micrococcus luteus. The performance of the UVAPS was
   found to depend on the type of airborne bacteria. In addition, the
   fluorescence signals for stationary-phase bacteria were generally
   stronger than for their log-phase counterparts. These results indicated
   that bacterial injury due to environmental stresses has a strong
   influence on the measured fluorescence signals. This hypothesis was
   confirmed by obtaining a linear relationship between the percentage of
   fluorescent particles and the proportion of injured bacteria in the
   total population of cultivable bacteria in samples simultaneously
   collected with the AGI-30 impingers. This indicates that the amount of
   fluorophors (specifically NADH) within injured bacteria is below the
   UVAPS sensitivity level. The practical implications of these findings
   are discussed in the paper. The reported results contribute to
   broadening our understanding of the method and may assist in developing
   sampling strategies for the application of the UVAPS to various
   bioaerosol studies. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Predicting the response of farmland bird populations to changing food

Abstract = {{1. Agricultural developments over recent decades have had significant
   negative effects on wildlife. Modern European agriculture faces many
   further developments in technology, finances and climate. A framework
   for predicting the consequences of these developments and for informing
   management that mitigates previous depredation of wildlife is essential.
   2. Field trials, monitoring and experimental approaches are all
   invaluable tools for predicting the consequences of proposed
   agricultural practices. However, such trials are time-consuming and
   expensive, with limited spatial and temporal scope. Increasingly, it is
   recognized that predictive modelling using computer simulations is
   essential for assessing the likely impacts of novel management
   practices.
   3. Many agricultural developments are likely to have impacts on the
   availability of food for farmland wildlife. In this paper, we review
   modelling techniques that are available for predicting the consequences
   of changing food supplies for farmland birds, a group already shown to
   be sensitive to agricultural management.
   4. We focus on two broad types of simulation modelling: phenomenological
   approaches (using aggregative responses or full population models), and
   behavioural depletion models (including daily ration and functional
   response approaches). We assess the strengths and weaknesses of each,
   particularly with regard to available data.
   5. We conclude that given the constraints on current information, daily
   ration models probably represent the most useful form of simulation
   modelling for farmland birds. Few phenomenological population models
   link demography explicitly to food supply and collecting data on these
   links should be a priority of autecological studies. More empirical data
   on aggregative and functional responses is needed to identify the
   generality of these functions, and to confront uncertainties in their
   use.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Modelling techniques available for
   predicting the consequences of changing food supply for farmland birds
   have largely outstripped the availability of data required to
   parameterize them. We recommend the best available techniques given
   current constraints on data. Predictive models of biodiversity response
   should be more widely used when considering proposals for agricultural
   developments or agri-environment schemes. Models will provide a basis
   for selecting between competing proposals, whilst their widespread usage
   will both permit more frequent model validation and aid in model
   development.}},

Abstract = {{1. Environmental assessments of coastal aquaculture are concerned mostly
   with direct impacts on natural assemblages in the vicinity of shellfish
   or fin-fish farms. As the size and density of farmed sea space
   increases, there is greater potential for indirect effects on food webs
   beyond the immediate culture area.
   2. We investigated the potential indirect effects of long-line mussel
   Perna canaliculus farms on the demography of an important benthic
   predator, the sea star Coscinasterias muricata. Surveys beneath four
   active farms, an abandoned farm and three unfarmed areas of seabed in
   Pelorus Sound, New Zealand, described the direct effects of mussel
   culture on the distribution and abundance of sea stars and other benthic
   consumers. These data were used to calibrate a model that simulated the
   fertilization success of sea star populations in farmed and unfarmed
   areas of the bays.
   3. Deposits of living mussels and mussel shells covered up to 55\% of
   the seafloor beneath farm sites, but were absent from soft sediments at
   unfarmed sites. Mean densities of sea stars were up to 39 times larger
   at active farm sites than in unfarmed areas and were correlated with the
   abundance of living mussels on the seafloor.
   4. Within individual farms, the distribution of sea stars was highly
   aggregated at small spatial scales, with most (63\%) individuals
   occurring within 2 m of their nearest neighbour. In unfarmed areas, sea
   stars were widely dispersed (< 1 80 m(-2)).
   5. Our simulations indicate that, because of the extremely clumped
   distributions of sea stars, spawning individuals at farm sites would on
   average have substantially greater fertilization success (c. 90\% of
   eggs) than those foraging in areas where farms are absent (<< 2\% of
   eggs), and total zygote production could be as much as 1500 times
   greater than in unfarmed areas.
   6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the potential for
   significant bottom-up effects of aquaculture on surrounding ecological
   assemblages. If, as has been suggested, sperm limitation is a major
   constraint on recruitment of asteroids and other invertebrate predators,
   supplemental provisioning from increased farm development could result
   in occasional outbreaks of populations, over a broader area than the
   farmed location. Without appropriate monitoring such events are likely
   to be dismissed as rare, natural phenomena rather than a consequence of
   shellfish culture.}},

Abstract = {{1. The debate over the interaction between shellfishing and shorebirds
   is long-running. Behaviour-based models predict how animal populations
   are influenced by environmental change from the behavioural responses of
   individual animals to this change. These models are a potential tool for
   addressing shellfishery problems, but to be of value they must produce
   reliable predictions using data that are readily available or can be
   collected relatively quickly.
   2. We parameterized a behaviour-based model for the oystercatcher
   population of the Wash, UK, for 1990-99 using data from shellfishery
   (mussels and cockles), shorebird and climate monitoring schemes. During
   the 1990s the overwinter mortality rates of Wash oystercatchers varied
   widely. The model correctly identified the years in which the observed
   overwinter mortality was either low (1-2\%) or high (10-26\%) from
   annual variation in the food supply, oystercatcher population size and
   temperature.
   3. Many oystercatchers were observed and predicted to die when only a
   fraction of the available food was consumed. Within the model at least,
   this was because interference competition excluded the least dominant
   birds from part of the food supply and the least efficient foragers died
   before the food supply was fully depleted. A simplified model, which
   excluded interference and individual variation, incorrectly predicted
   that all birds survived in all years. Models that exclude these two
   components of behaviour will tend to underestimate the effect of mussel
   and cockle food shortage on oystercatchers. Shellfishery management
   based on such predictions may cause high oystercatcher mortality rates
   even though enough food would appear to be reserved for the birds.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This study shows how a behaviour-based
   model can be parameterized and predict annual variation in oystercatcher
   mortality using data routinely collected from the Wash. The principle on
   which the model is based, that animals behave in order to maximize their
   chances of survival and reproduction, applies to any system, and the
   shellfishery, bird and climate data used to parameterize the model are
   widely available. The model can be used to advise how to manage
   shellfisheries, by predicting the proportion of the stock that needs to
   remain unfished in order to maintain low oystercatcher mortality rates.}},

Title = {{Dung and nest surveys: estimating decay rates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1102-1111}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Wildlife managers often require estimates of abundance. Direct
   methods of estimation are often impractical, especially in closed-forest
   environments, so indirect methods such as dung or nest surveys are
   increasingly popular.
   2. Dung and nest surveys typically have three elements: surveys to
   estimate abundance of the dung or nests; experiments to estimate the
   production (defecation or nest construction) rate; and experiments to
   estimate the decay or disappearance rate. The last of these is usually
   the most problematic, and was the subject of this study.
   3. The design of experiments to allow robust estimation of mean time to
   decay was addressed. In most studies to date, dung or nests have been
   monitored until they disappear. Instead, we advocate that fresh dung or
   nests are located, with a single follow-up visit to establish whether
   the dung or nest is still present or has decayed.
   4. Logistic regression was used to estimate probability of decay as a
   function of time, and possibly of other covariates. Mean time to decay
   was estimated from this function.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Effective management of mammal
   populations usually requires reliable abundance estimates. The
   difficulty in estimating abundance of mammals in forest environments has
   increasingly led to the use of indirect survey methods, in which
   abundance of sign, usually dung (e.g. deer, antelope and elephants) or
   nests (e.g. apes), is estimated. Given estimated rates of sign
   production and decay, sign abundance estimates can be converted to
   estimates of animal abundance. Decay rates typically vary according to
   season, weather, habitat, diet and many other factors, making reliable
   estimation of mean time to decay of signs present at the time of the
   survey problematic. We emphasize the need for retrospective rather than
   prospective rates, propose a strategy for survey design, and provide
   analysis methods for estimating retrospective rates.}},

Abstract = {{Three introduced predators, the dingo (Canis lupus dingo), the fox
   (Vulpes vulpes) and the feral cat (Felis catus) are widespread
   throughout the and interior of Western Australia. While the dingo has
   been present for an estimated 3500-4000 years, the fox and the feral cat
   are relatively recent arrivals and have been implicated in the modern
   decline and in some cases extinction of and zone fauna, especially
   medium size mammals. This paper reports on a long-term, large-scale
   project aimed at developing control strategies for these introduced
   predators. Broad area control of foxes and dingoes in the Gibson Desert
   using 40-60g dried meat baits impregnated with the poison sodium
   monofluoroacetate (1080) and delivered by aircraft at a density of 5
   baits km(-2) proved to be highly effective. Following a single aerial
   baiting of some 1600 km(2), foxes and dingoes were virtually eradicated
   from a core area for up to 15 months, but feral cats appeared to
   increase in abundance. Two aerial baitings (each 400 km(2)) carried out
   during periods of below average rainfall using a small (about 30 g)
   fresh meat bait developed to be attractive to feral cats reduced their
   abundance by an estimated 75\% and 100\% when baits were delivered at a
   density of 10 and 22 km(-2), respectively. A third aerial baiting at a
   density of I I baits km(-2) carried out during a period of above average
   rainfall reduced feral cat density by only 25\% when surveyed 3 months
   after baiting. Baiting density, frequency and season are key factors
   likely to affect the impact of baiting on feral cat populations.
   Preliminary studies reveal that the home range of feral cats in this
   environment varies from about 700 to 1200 ha. Reptiles and small native
   mammals form the major dietary items of feral cats and the seasonal
   variation in abundance of these items is likely to affect bait uptake.
   These observations have important implications for control strategies.

Abstract = {{Variation in coloration with a strong underlying genetic basis is
   frequently found in birds, insects, anurans, molluscs and plants.
   Although such a variation can be large, little is known about its
   functional value. Correlative data, however, can help suggest testable
   hypotheses about potential covariation between reproductive parameters
   and a colour polymorphism displayed by individuals belonging to a single
   population. In this context, we studied two Swiss populations of tawny
   owls Strix aluco, a polymorphic species that varies in coloration from
   reddish-brown to grey. Observations in the first population showed that
   although greyer females had shorter tarsi, they produced heavier
   offspring in two of three years. Pairing with respect to plumage
   coloration was not significantly disassortative, indicating that these
   correlations were probably not inflated by plumage coloration of the
   mate. In the second population, where breeding females had been
   monitored for 14 years, the proportion of all breeding females that were
   reddish-brown was greater in years when the breeding density was lower.
   Capture-recapture analyses show that the latter result is explained by
   the fact that greyish females bred less often than reddish-brown
   females, although their survival probability was similar. The number of
   greyer breeding females was greater when spring/summer temperatures were
   lower. When combined, the results from the two populations lend support
   to the hypothesis that grey females do not breed every year, but produce
   offspring of higher quality. Whatever the mechanism underlying the
   correlations reported in this study, colour polymorphism in female tawny
   owls appears to reflect some components of individual quality.}},

Abstract = {{The assumption that males and females are equally tolerant to pesticides
   in haplodiploid arthropods led to the prediction that the evolution of
   resistance is faster in haplodiploid than in diploid arthropods.
   However, in this review, it was found that the ratio of male to female
   tolerance is substantially smaller in haplodiploid than in diploid
   arthropods, indicating that resistance alleles are not strongly
   up-regulated in haploid males. in addition, males were generally less
   tolerant than females in both haplodiploid and diploid arthropods.
   Factors such as sexual size dimorphism and sex-dependent selection may
   account for the lower tolerance in males than in females. Little
   among-population variation in the ratio of male to female tolerance was
   found in three species. Moreover, the tolerance ratio generally remained
   unchanged by selection for resistance to pesticides, although
   significant among-species variation was present within arthropod orders.
   This indicates that sexual dimorphism in pesticide tolerance evolves at
   a slower rate than resistance to pesticides. Simulations considering
   between-sex differences in pesticide tolerance showed that resistance
   evolution can be slower in haplodiploids than in diploids. Recessive
   resistance, low male tolerance to pesticides, fitness costs expressed in
   males, and the use of refuges contributed in substantially delaying the
   evolution of resistance in haplodiploid arthropods. These findings cast
   a new perspective on the evolution of pesticide resistance in
   haplodiploid herbivores and natural enemies.}},

Abstract = {{Activity patterns of Phyllophaga crinita (Burmeister), Phyllophaga
   congrua (LeConte), Phyllophaga crassissima (Blanchard), and Cyclocephala
   lurida (Bland) grubs were monitored with acoustic sensors in small pots
   of bluegrass, Poa arachnifera Torr, at varying and constant temperatures
   over multiple-day periods. Experienced listeners readily distinguished
   three types of sound with distinct differences in frequency and temporal
   patterns, intensities, and durations. Of approximate to3,000 sounds
   detected from P. crinita larvae, 7\% were identifiable as snaps, with
   large amplitudes and short durations typically associated with root
   breakage or clipping activity. Approximately 60\% were identifiable as
   rustles, suggestive of surfaces sliding or rubbing past each other
   during general movement activity. Another 2\% of sounds contained
   patterns of repeated pulses suggestive of surfaces scraping across a
   pointed ridge. The remaining 31\% bad spectral or temporal patterns that
   fell outside the ranges of easily recognizable sound types. Because the
   behavioral significance of the different sound types has not yet been
   fully established, the classified and unclassified sounds were pooled
   together in analyses of the effects of species, temperature, weight, and
   time of day. Grubs of all four species produced detectable sounds at
   rates that increased with temperature {[}0.45 sounds/((min)(degreesC))]
   and larval weight {[}6.3 sounds/((min)(g))]. Mean sound rates were
   independent of species and time of day. At temperatures <9degreesC, mean
   sound rates fell below the typical levels of background noise observed
   under field conditions. This reduced activity at low temperatures is
   likely to reduce the effectiveness of acoustic monitoring in the field
   in cold weather. The consistency of results obtained in these tests over
   multiple-day periods suggests that acoustic systems have potential as
   tools for nondestructive monitoring of the efficacy of insect management
   treatments as well as for biological and ecological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variability data were used
   to study infestations of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata
   (Wiedemann) in Florida in 1997 and 1998. A total of 132 flies collected
   in monitoring traps or as larvae removed from fruit were examined at
   three polymorphic mtDNA restriction sites and two microsatellite loci.
   All of the flies sampled in Florida in 1997 displayed the mitochondrial
   AAB haplotype and represent a novel introduction of Mediterranean fruit
   flies into the state. All flies collected in central Florida in 1998
   also displayed the AAB haplotype. Microsatellite analysis of these
   specimens from 1998 detected only alleles that were present in 1997.
   These results strongly indicate that the 1998 Florida outbreaks were
   derived from the Florida populations from the previous year. According
   to our analyses, the Mediterranean region is the most likely source for
   the 1997 Florida infestation. Flies from a small outbreak in Miami
   Springs, Dade County, FL, early in 1998 bad a different mtDNA haplotype,
   characterized by the AAC restriction pattern. Microsatellites of these
   specimens showed significant differences in their allelic distribution
   from AAB flies, indicating an origin from a separate source population.
   South America is the most likely source for the Miami Springs flies.}},

Abstract = {{Incidental sounds produced by Phyllophaga crinita (Burmeister) and
   Cyclocephala lurida (Bland) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) white grubs were
   monitored with single- and multiple-sensor acoustic detection systems in
   turf fields and golf course fairways in Texas. The maximum detection
   range of an individual acoustic sensor was measured in a greenhouse as
   approximately the area enclosed in a 26.5-cm-diameter perimeter (552
   cm(2)). A single-sensor acoustic system was used to rate the likelihood
   of white grub infestation at monitored sites, and a four-sensor array
   was used to count the numbers of white grubs at sites where infestations
   were identified. White grub population densities were acoustically
   estimated by dividing the estimated numbers of white grubs by the area
   of the detection range. For comparisons with acoustic monitoring
   methods, infestations were assessed also by examining 10-cm-diameter
   soil cores collected with a standard golf cup-cutter. Both acoustic and
   cup-cutter assessments of infestation and estimates of white grub
   population densities were verified by excavation and sifting of the soil
   around the sensors after each site was monitored. The single-sensor
   acoustic method was more successful in assessing infestations at a
   recording site than was the cup-cutter method, possibly because the
   detection range was larger than the area of the soil core. White grubs
   were recovered from >90\% of monitored sites rated at medium or high
   likelihood of infestation. Infestations were successfully identified at
   23 of the 24 sites where white grubs were recovered at densities
   >50/m(2), the threshold for economic damage. The four-sensor array
   yielded the most accurate estimates of the numbers of white grubs in the
   detection range, enabling reliable, nondestructive estimation of white
   grub population densities. However, tests with the array took longer and
   were more difficult to perform than tests with the single sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies were conducted in southeastern Minnesota from 2000 to 2002
   to determine the phenology of Lygus lineolaris in various habitats and
   to compare yellow and white sticky traps as a sampling method for adult
   L. lineolaris. Strawberry fields were sampled for L. lineolaris adults
   using yellow sticky traps, and nymphs were sampled using the standard
   white pan beat method. Adult L. lineolaris abundance in alfalfa, an
   adjacent fence-row, and a wooded habitat were also compared. The
   nonlinear relationship between cumulative trap catch and cumulative
   degree-days was modeled with a two-parameter cumulative Weibull function
   to predict early-season adult capture using yellow sticky traps. Adult
   L. lineolaris were detected in bearing-year strawberries at the onset of
   vegetative growth in all years. Yellow sticky traps caught significantly
   higher densities of adult L. lineolaris than white sticky traps. The
   Weibull model predicted 50\% capture at 10 DD (>12.4degreesC), which
   corresponds to the vegetative strawberry growth stage. L. lineolaris
   nymphs were not detected until the blossom stage. Alfalfa harbored
   significantly higher densities of L. lineolaris than other habitats
   during early-season sampling (i.e., March-June). Late-season sampling
   (July-September) revealed significantly higher densities in bearing-year
   strawberries. These results suggest that monitoring at the onset of
   vegetative growth, using yellow sticky traps, will be an efficient
   method for detecting early L. lineolaris adult activity.}},

Abstract = {{Two aspects of the Exterra Termite Interception and Baiting System
   (Ensystex, Fayetteville, NC) were evaluated in a field experiment using
   13 termite mounds near Townsville, Australia. First, a cellulose-acetate
   powder containing either 0.05\% wt:wt or 0.25\% wt:wt chlorfluazuron
   (Requiem, Ensystex, Fayetteville, NC) was tested for its efficacy in
   eliminating colonies of the xylophagous mound-building subterranean
   termite Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). The moist bait matrix was
   replenished during the first inspection of 10 mounds (five mounds by two
   treatments) used in the experiment. Second, a single application of the
   moist bait matrix was used on three additional mounds to test termite
   responses and the effectiveness of 0.25\% wt:wt chlorfluazuron. Although
   there was no evidence of repellence, there was little removal of
   replenished bait. Five colonies were eliminated by 0.05\% wt:wt
   chlorfluazuron and five colonies by 0.25\% wt:wt chlorfluazuron: another
   colony was moribund, and elimination appeared imminent. Colony decline
   was first suspected some 12 wk after bait application, and colony
   elimination was confirmed, by destructive sampling, about 5 wk later.
   Colony elimination may have occurred within 12 wk. One colony was an
   anomaly and did not succumb to the effects of the toxicant. Another
   colony was not eliminated because of invasion of the baiting system by
   ants. Ants, principally Iridomyrmex purpureus (F. Smith) group and
   Papyrius nitidus (Mayr) group, occurred commonly in the stations during
   the experiment. Microcerotermes sp. was found in five of the C.
   acinaciformis mounds, after colony elimination. Inspections of small
   sections of mounds and wooden dowels inserted into mounds were reliable
   methods for monitoring colony health.}},

   principal vector of several plant pathogenic diseases, particularly
   Pierce's Disease in grapevines, and oleander leaf scorch. A
   microplate-based assay is described that measures the sensitivity of
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity to inhibition by organophyosphorus
   (OP) insecticides in this important pest. The technique provides users
   with an accurate measure of the efficacy of OP binding to this target
   site, and is a valuable too] for monitoring field populations of the
   insect to determine whether the use of OP insecticides has selected for
   resistant individuals. The technique will also measure AChE sensitivity
   in the smoke-tree sharpshooter, H. lacerta Fowler. This species is
   native to California and is regarded only as a minor pest. Both
   inhibition and kinetic measurements for the AChE enzymes in these
   sharpshooters demonstrate the close phylogenetic relationships between
   the two species.}},

Abstract = {{Twelve polymorphic allozyme loci were employed to assess the genetic
   change in a captive breeding population of the endangered killifish
   Aphanius baeticus in the Donana National Park, south-western Spain. The
   initial founder event did not significantly reduce the allelic richness
   or the expected heterozygosity. No genetic bottleneck signature was
   detected by tests for deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium. The
   F-ST between the wild source and captive population, however, was
   relatively high (0(.)053 or 0(.)122 when excluding or including the
   locus IDHP-1{*} respectively), after just two to three generations in
   captivity. Two generations after the incorporation of 68 new wild
   specimens (greater than five generations after founding) decreased the
   genetic differences and the FST (0(.)041 excluding IDHP-1{*}). The
   restoration efforts appeared to be helpful and the study of 12
   polymorphic loci and a sensitive parameter such as FST were useful for
   monitoring genetic changes in captivity. Nonetheless, future monitoring
   should include additional highly polymorphic loci (microsatellites) to
   achieve higher power to detect genetic change. Such restoration and
   monitoring efforts should help to avoid rapid inbreeding, adaptation to
   captivity, and to maintain the long-term evolutionary potential in small
   isolated populations. (C) 2003 The Fisheries Society of the British

Abstract = {{Community-based comprehensive primary healthcare programmes are a
   widely-promoted strategy for improving child survival in less-developed
   countries, but limited documentation exists concerning their
   effectiveness in actually reducing child mortality. This study examined
   the impact of a community-based comprehensive primary healthcare
   programme on child survival in Bolivia. Mortality rates from two
   intervention areas where Andean Rural Health Care (ARHC) had been
   conducting child-survival activities for 5-9 years were compared with
   those from two geographically-adjacent comparison areas that lacked such
   activities and that were virtually identical to the intervention areas
   in socioeconomic characteristics. Vital events were registered at the
   time of regular visit to all homes. In the comparison areas, limited
   services were available which reached only a small percentage of the
   population, while in the intervention areas, prenatal care,
   immunizations, growth monitoring, nutrition rehabilitation, and acute
   curative services were readily available to the entire population. In
   1992-1993, the annual rates of mortality of children, aged less than
   five years, were 205.5 per 1,000 and 98.5 per 1,000 in the comparison
   and intervention areas respectively. The absolute difference in
   mortality of 107.0 deaths per 1,000 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   72.7-141.3 per 1,000) represented 52.1\% (95\% CI, 35.2-68.8\%) lower
   mortality of children aged less than five years in the intervention
   areas compared to the control communities. These results suggest that
   the provision of community-based, integrated health services can
   significantly improve child survival in poor countries. Better-designed
   and larger field trials of community-based comprehensive primary
   healthcare programmes in multiple regions of the world are needed to
   provide a stronger scientific basis for developing this approach further
   in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{Osmoderma eremita is a threatened scarab beetle living in the hollows of
   old deciduous trees and is regarded as an umbrella species of the beetle
   fauna associated with this habitat. Several methods like pitfall
   trapping and wood mould sampling have been used to monitor the
   occurrence of O. eremita, but these methods cannot be applied for trees
   with certain characteristics. Recently, (R)-(+)-gamma-decalactone was
   identified as a male-produced sex pheromone of the species. Here, we
   show that gamma-decalactone can be detected in hollow trees by air
   sampling and that the presence of the compound is strongly correlated
   with the occurrence of living male beetles in the same trees. Air was
   sampled from tree cavities and extracts analysed using gas
   chromatography-and mass spectrometry. There was a 89\% match between the
   detection of gamma-decalactone in extracts and the occurrence of male O.
   eremita +/- 2 days from the sampling event. In the absence of males,
   samples never contained gamma-decalactone, and the presence of this
   compound in a tree cavity appears to be a good predictor of O. eremita
   occupancy. Air sampling can be a useful complement to other methods when
   trying to detect as many trees housing this beetle as possible, which is
   crucial when estimating populations sizes and developing conservation

Abstract = {{Palmaria palmata (Linnaeus) O. Kuntze (Rhodophyta, Palmariaceae) is a
   seaweed commercially harvested for human consumption. Its population
   density, size structure, and frond dynamics were investigated from May
   1999 to May 2001 at one intertidal locality in the northern coast of
   Spain, which is within the southern distributional boundary of the
   species in the eastern Atlantic coasts. The effect of size, age, and the
   life-history phase (haploid vs. diploid) on frond growth and mortality
   were also evaluated. The study was carried out by mapping and monitoring
   fronds in the field. New fronds (macroscopic recruits or sprouts)
   appeared in spring, but subsequent mortality of these young fronds and
   detachment of the host plant led to lower density values in January.
   Palmaria palmata exhibited a distinctive seasonal growth cycle, with
   positive net growth from March to August and breakage from August to
   March. Interannual differences were also detected, with higher net
   growth in 2000 than in 1999. Net growth was apparently independent of
   age, reproductive status (fertile vs. reproductive), and life-history
   phase (haploid vs. diploid) but was dependent on size, as longer fronds
   showed minor growth or greater breakage than small ones. Mortality, on
   the other hand, was more dependent on age than on size in the period
   analyzed (March-May 2000). Results of the study indicate that both size
   and age should be included as state variables and temporal changes in
   transition probabilities considered in the development of demographic
   models of the species.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to characterize the extracellular
   polysaccharides (EPS) released by a freshwater Thalassiosira sp.
   (Bacillariophyceae) and evaluate their degradation by heterotrophic
   microbial populations from the same habitat of Thalassiosira sp., a
   tropical eutrophic reservoir. The EPS were purified by anion exchange
   column chromatography, the monosaccharide composition was determined by
   GC, and the linkages of the monosaccharides by GC-MS. The EPS is a
   mannose-rich heteropolysaccharide composed of two different acidic
   fractions. Both of these fractions are composed of mannose, rhamnose,
   fucose, xylose, galactose, glucose, glucuronic acid, and N-acetyl
   glucosamine but with different proportions. N-acetyl galactosamine
   occurs only in fraction 1 and galacturonic acid only in fraction 2. We
   monitored the concentrations of the monosaccharides in the EPS during
   its degradation using pulse amperometric detection in an HPLC. The decay
   patterns of the monosaccharides were varied and the deoxy sugars, fucose
   and rhamnose, were degraded at a slower rate than the other components,
   increasing their relative concentrations and the hydrophobic feature of
   the EPS. The possibility of a selective degradation, which enhances the
   stickiness of the EPS, promoting transparent exopolymeric particles and
   aggregate formation, is discussed based on the literature data.}},

Abstract = {{The radon concentration in Jordanian drinking water and hot springs has
   been measured using the electret-passive environmental radon monitoring
   method. This study maps out Jordanian water sources from the north to
   the south as well as the area around the capital Amman and the Jordan
   valley. Samples from 30 sources were collected and analysed during the
   period from November 2001 to June 2002. We have found that 60\% of the
   drinking water sources have radon concentrations above the proposed US
   Environmental Protection Agency limit of 11 Bq l(-1); these are mostly
   situated in the northern region of the country. Fortunately, these
   sources supplied only a small number of people since they were mainly
   located in rural areas. Tap water in the capital Amman, where
   approximately 35\% of the population live, has a very low radon
   concentration, 3.9 Bq l(-1). However, the isolated northern drinking
   water wells did show a radon level as high as 117 Bq l(-1). Hot springs
   in Jordan have a radon level ranging between 63 and 81 Bq l(-1), again
   mainly in the northern region. In general we conclude that Jordanian
   drinking water is safe as far as radon concentration is concerned with
   the exception of a few isolated local drinking water wells.}},

Abstract = {{Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) populations were monitored extensively in the
   Kawartha Lakes region of Ontario, Canada, from 1978-2000, and
   intensively monitored in a subsample of these lakes, particularly
   Sturgeon Lake, (1991-2001). The number of occupied nests within the
   Kawartha Lakes region increased from 18 nests in 1978 to 89 nests in
   1992 following the ban of organochlorine pesticides and the provision of
   artificial nesting structures. Surveys in 1996 and 2000, however,
   revealed 78 and 66 occupied nests, respectively, indicating a recent
   population decline or stabilization. The Osprey breeding colony at
   Sturgeon Lake followed very similar trends in nest numbers, peaking in
   the mid-1990s, followed by a decline and apparent population
   stabilization by 2001. The mean annual productivity in this colony
   between 1986 and 2001 was 1.17 chicks per occupied nest, and exceeded
   the reported replacement level of 0.8 chicks per nest. Population
   fluctuations and trends in overall annual production of fledglings were
   similar between the Sturgeon Lake breeding colony and birds breeding at
   lower densities in neighboring lakes. Estimated potential recruitment to
   the Sturgeon Lake colony, based on the number of fledglings produced 3-5
   years previously, was positively related to population size in a given
   year (r(2) = 0.65); but very few banded nestlings returned to the colony
   as breeders. Factors affecting productivity and population trends seem
   to operate similarly at local and regional scales. As very few fledged
   juveniles returned to the Sturgeon Lake colony as breeders, yet the
   population was maintained, we suggest there was probably considerable
   dispersal of juveniles among local natal sites throughout the region.}},

Abstract = {{In 1997, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revised the National
   Ambient Air Quality Standard governing ozone (O-3), adding an 8-hr
   standard of 0.08 ppm and phasing out the 1-hr requirement of 0.12 ppm.
   The 8-hr standard is intended to provide greater protection for human
   health. This research examines spatial and temporal patterns of
   exceedances of the standards using monitoring data and modeled
   estimates. The Penn State/ National Center for Atmospheric Research
   Mesoscale Model and Models-3 framework were used to estimate hourly O-3
   concentrations for 4-km resolution in the Maryland/
   Virginia/Delaware/Washington, DC, and northern Georgia domains.
   Results reveal that the spatial and temporal nature of compliance is
   considerably different under the 8-hr standard. In the modeling
   simulations, the 8-hr standard was exceeded 2-5.2 times more often and
   in a 1.8-16.2 times larger area than the 1-hr standard. The 8-hr
   standard was exceeded in, areas that generally comply with the 1-hr
   standard and are not well covered by the monitoring network.
   These results imply that a larger population resides in areas with
   unhealthy 0, levels than noncompliance with the original 1-hr standard
   suggests. For the MD/VA/ DE/DC domains, 80 and 98\% of the total
   population live in areas with 8-hr National Ambient Air Quality
   Standards (NAAQS) exceedances for the 1990 and 1995 episodes,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A written document was developed to clarify the District's adult
   mosquito-management tactics to other interested individuals and
   agencies. The program described consists of 7 discrete components: 1)
   initiation criteria, 2) treatment area delineation, 3) agricultural and
   land-use practices, 4) meteorological conditions, 5) continuance
   criteria, 6) termination criteria, and 7) factors influencing
   implementation. The guidelines were adopted as policy by the District's
   Board of Trustees in 1998 and have been implemented in each of the last
   5 years. The adult mosquito population is monitored with 6 Mosquito
   Magnet(TM) traps strategically located in the rice culture areas.
   Samples are collected daily and laboratory technicians notify the
   Adulticide/Airplane Coordinator of collection results before 1:00 p.m.}},

Abstract = {{From June 1995 to August 2002 we assessed green turtle (Chelonia mydas)
   population structure and survival, and identified human impact, at Bahia
   de los Angeles, a large bay that was once the site of the greatest sea
   turtle harvest rates in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Turtles were
   captured live with entanglement nets and mortality was quantified
   through stranding surveys and flipper tag recoveries. A total of 14,820
   netting hours (617.5 d) resulted in 255 captures of 200 green turtles.
   Straight-carapace length and mass ranged from 46.0-100.0 cm (mean = 74.3
   +/- 0.7 cm) and 14.5-145.0 kg (mean = 61.5 +/- 1.7 kg), respectively.
   The size-frequency distribution remained stable during all years and
   among all capture locations. Anthropogenic-derived injuries ranging from
   missing flippers to boat propeller scars were present in 4\% of captured
   turtles. Remains of 18 turtles were found at dumpsites, nine stranded
   turtles were encountered in the study area, and flipper tags from seven
   turtles were recovered. Survival was estimated at 0.58 for juveniles and
   0.97 for adults using a joint live-recapture and dead-recovery model
   (Burnham model). Low survival among juveniles, declining annual catch
   per unit effort, and the presence of butchered carcasses indicated human
   activities continue to impact green turtles at this foraging area.}},

Abstract = {{With increased concern over the status of reptile populations globally,
   contaminant studies should be part of species evaluations. We analyzed
   eggs of western pond turtles from Fern Ridge Reservoir in western Oregon
   for 20 organochlorine (OC) pesticides or metabolites, 42
   congener-specific polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 16 trace
   elements or metals. These eggs represent the first of this species
   analyzed. The OC pesticides and PCB residue concentrations in the
   western pond turtle eggs were generally low and similar to those found
   in eggs of snapping turtles from a remote site in Ontario, Canada.
   Western pond turtle eggs also contained mercury and chromium, which are
   metals of special concern. Although few reptilian eggs have been
   analyzed for metals, the 44.9 mug/g dry weight chromium in a western
   pond turtle egg in this study may be the highest reported in a reptilian
   egg. We found no significant difference in contaminant concentrations in
   eggs from nests in Oregon, where all turtle eggs failed to hatch
   compared to those where some eggs hatched. During this initial project,
   however, we were unable to assess fully the role of OCs, PCBs and other
   contaminants in the western pond turtle decline. Factors other than
   contaminants may be involved. In another study, snapping turtle eggs
   near the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin were much more
   contaminated with evidence reported of effects on sex differentiation
   and reproductive endocrine function. Egg hatchability, the only
   reproductive parameter monitored, may not be the most sensitive
   endpoint. Other endpoints, including endocrine function, deformity
   rates, growth rates, and sex determination need study.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed variation in age in a fluctuating population of the common
   vole (Microtus arvalis) in southern Moravia, Czech Republic, to test the
   assumption of the senescence hypothesis that the age of voles increases
   with increasing population density. Between 1996 and 1998, we monitored
   the demographic changes by snap-trapping and live-trapping in a field
   population passing through the increase, peak and decline phase of the
   population cycle. We used the eye lens mass method to determine the age
   of snap-trapped animals and those that died in live-traps. The average
   age of winter males was clearly higher after the peak phase breeding
   season than before it. No such phase-dependent shift in age, however,
   was observed in the female component. Male age continued to increase
   from autumn to spring over the pre-peak winter, and the highest age was
   in spring of the peak phase year. However, after the peak phase breeding
   season the highest age was achieved in winter, with the decline phase
   males during the next spring tending to be younger. The average age of
   females in spring populations was always lower than in winter
   populations. The average age of voles from live-traps was always higher
   than voles from snap-traps, particularly in winter and spring
   populations, suggesting the presence of senescent animals. Although the
   density-dependent changes in age are consistent with those observed for
   other voles, they provide only weak evidence that population cycles in
   the common vole are accompanied by pronounced shifts in individual age,
   particularly in female voles.}},

Abstract = {{The decision how to allocate marginal resources to reproduction and
   growth can have important effects on associated life-history parameters
   as well as on population dynamics. In addition to showing variation
   among individuals in a population, such allocation rules may be either
   condition-dependent or fixed in different individuals. While many
   studies on anuran amphibians have focused on egg numbers and egg sizes
   in females of different sizes, virtually no data exist on the relative
   allocation of marginal resources to growth versus reproduction. In the
   laboratory, we therefore offered female common frogs (Rana temporaria)
   low versus high food rations for a full reproductive cycle, and
   monitored their growth and later reproductive investment (egg number and
   egg size the following breeding season). Feeding rates had an effect
   both on female growth and on egg number and size. There was no trade-off
   found between the two forms of investment. A flexible allocation rule
   could not be supported as there was no significant effect of feeding
   rate on the relative allocation of resources to growth versus
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that underlie colonization success is crucial
   both for ecological theory and conservation practices. The most
   effective way to assess colonization ability is to introduce
   experimentally different sets of individuals in empty patches of
   suitable habitat and to monitor the outcome. We translocated mated
   female waterstriders, Aquarius najas, into 90 streams that were not
   currently inhabited by the species. We manipulated sizes of propagules
   (from 2 to 16 mated females) and numbers of origin populations (one or
   two). Three origin populations were genetically different from each
   other, but they were less than 150 km from the streams of translocation.
   The results demonstrate clearly that both the larger propagule size and
   the high number of source populations have positive effects on the
   probability of colonizing a new stream. Thus, in addition to the
   stochastic factors related to the propagule size it may be essential to
   consider also the diversity of genetic origin for colonization success.}},

Abstract = {{Many terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by intermittent production
   of abundant resources for consumers, termed pulsed resources. The impact
   of resource pulses on populations downwind of the initial pulse are only
   beginning to be characterized, while the relationship between the
   frequencies of pulses and the long-term growth rate of affected species
   is unknown. I monitored the reproductive success of veeries (Catharus
   fuscescens) breeding in oak-dominated forest in southeastern New York
   State from 1998 to 2002. During this time veeries experienced high
   interannual variability in growth rates as a consequence of trophic
   cascades stemming from pulsed production of acorns. Rodent populations
   that benefited from acorns also depreciated veery nests, while raptors
   that increased in response to rodent outbreaks are major predators on
   adult and juvenile birds. Veeries may recoup losses following low to
   moderate acorn crops that lead to rodent population declines. Thus,
   veeries fluctuate between years of positive and negative growth rate,
   however, long-term population trends, and thus true source-sink
   designation, cannot be made until the frequency of various year types is
   characterized. I simulated long-term growth rates using reproductive
   parameters estimated from field studies and survivorship data from the
   literature. Simulations suggest that variability in the frequency of
   masting events in oaks can lead to similar to 10\% fluctuation in
   long-term growth rates in veeries. These studies suggest that temporal
   variability in masting dynamics has the potential to substantially
   influence songbird population trends. Furthermore, spatial variability
   in masting characteristics (e.g. the frequency of masting events and/or
   the size of seed crops) may greatly contribute to regional differences
   in songbird population trends. Because even less is known about the
   relationship between sizes of acorn crops and songbird populations, the
   influence of pulses in seed production on songbird population dynamics
   is likely to be underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial pattern of Sharka disease, caused by Plum pox virus (PPV)
   strain M, was investigated in 18 peach plots located in two areas of
   southern France. PPV infections were monitored visually for each
   individual tree during one to three consecutive years. Point pattern and
   correlation-type approaches were undertaken using the binary data
   directly or after parsing them in contiguous quadrats of 4, 9, and 16
   trees. Ordinary runs generally revealed a low but variable proportion of
   rows with adjacent symptomatic trees. Aggregation of disease incidence
   was indicated by the theta parameter of the beta-binomial distribution
   and related indices in 15 of the 18 plots tested for at least one
   assessment date of each. When aggregation was detected, it was indicated
   at all quadrat sizes and tended to be a function of disease incidence,
   as shown by the binary form of Taylor's power law. Spatial analysis by
   distance indices (SADIE) showed a nonrandom arrangement of quadrats with
   infected trees in 14 plots. The detection of patch clusters enclosing
   quadrats with above-average density of symptomatic trees, ellipsoidal in
   shape and generally extending from 4 to 14 trees within rows and from 4
   to 10 trees perpendicular to the rows, could be interpreted as local
   areas of influence of PPV spread. Spatial patterns at the plot scale
   were often characterized by the occurrence of several clusters of
   infected trees located up to 90 m apart in the direction of the rows.
   When several time assessments were available, increasing clustering over
   time was generally evidenced by stronger values of the clustering index
   and by increasing patch cluster size. The combination of the different
   approaches revealed a wide range of spatial patterns of PPV-M, from no
   aggregation to high aggregation of symptomatic trees at all spatial
   scales investigated. Such patterns suggested that aphid transmission to
   neighboring trees occurred frequently but was not systematic. The
   mechanism of primary virus introduction, the age and structure of the
   orchards when infected, and the diversity of vector species probably had
   a strong influence on the secondary spread of the disease. This study
   provides a more complete understanding of PPV-M patterns which could
   help to improve targeting of removal of PPV-infected trees for more
   effective disease control.}},

Abstract = {{Random amplified polymorphic DNAs and atp9-related sequences were
   amplified in cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) and maintainer lines drawn
   from a backcross programme to represent all five known cytoplasm types
   in chives. From these PCR amplifications, markers associated with
   CMS-inducing cytoplasm types, (S-1) and (S-2), and for two of the three
   known normal cytoplasm types, (N-2) and (N-3), were developed. These
   newly developed PCR markers were used to determine the cytoplasm types
   in 126 plants representing 12 German chive varieties. The dependability
   of these PCR markers was confirmed by analysis with previously described
   and marker-trait linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Two
   to five cytoplasm types were found in each of the 12 German chive
   varieties investigated. While the (S-1) cytoplasm occurred, on average,
   at a frequency of 5\% and the (S-2) cytoplasm at 12\%, the three normal
   cytoplasms (N-1), (N-2) and (N-3) were present at 30, 29 and 24\%,
   respectively. Thus, the prospects of finding maintainers for both CMS
   systems are relatively high in this population, if the frequency of
   non-restoring alleles for the nuclear genes involved is also high
   enough.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) in Iowa counties was conducted
   and the virus was found throughout the state. A long-term monitoring
   study (1989 to 2002) of the main BPMV vector, the bean leaf beetle,
   Cerotoma trifurcata, indicated that, in 2002, populations reached the
   highest abundance recorded in 14 years. Three potential sources for an
   early season primary inoculum source were found: (i) soybean (Glycine
   max) seed, (ii) overwintered bean leaf beetles, and (iii) alternate BPMV
   host plants. Examination of 5,804 and 8,064 soybean seedlings of two
   cultivars yielded 0 and 3 seedlings, respectively, infected with BPMV.
   In a separate test, BPMV was detected in mottled and nonmottled soybean
   seed. Some mottled seed did not contain BPMV, indicating that soybean
   seed coat mottling is an unreliable indicator for presence of the virus
   in seed. Of 194 naturally overwintered bean leaf beetles, only I
   transmitted BPMV to soybean. BPMV was detected serologically only in I
   alternate host, Desmodium canadense, out of 23 naturally occurring plant
   species collected from the field. The three inoculum sources discovered
   in Iowa in this study could be important primary sources when vector
   populations are high and indicate starting points for future
   epidemiological investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Isolates of Colletotrichum graminicola were collected from annual
   bluegrass or bent grass turf in Japan and the United States, and their
   sensitivities to QoI fungicides (QoIs) as well as their cytochrome b
   sequences were characterized. Five isolates sampled from turf treated
   repeated y with azoxystrobin were highly QoI resistant under both in
   vivo and in vitro test conditions. The nucleotide sequences of a large
   cytochrome b gene segment involving the binding site of QoIs were fully
   homologous for all resistant isolates and contained the G143A target
   site mutation known to confer QoI resistance in other pathogens.
   QoI-sensitive isolates collected prior to treatments with QoIs were more
   diverse with regard to their cytochrome b gene sequences and their
   phenotype responses to QoIs. All wild-type isolates retained a glycine
   in position 143 of cytochrome b. Three of the four QoI-sensitive
   isolates were, in addition, distinguished by leucines in positions 95,
   130, and 141, which were exchanged to threonine in all resistant but
   also in one of the sensitive isolates. In addition to a more pronounced
   divergence of cytochrome b sequences, the sensitive wild-type isolates
   also were diverse with regard to the induction of alternative
   respiration in response to QoI action, as indicated by comparisons of
   QoI sensitivities displayed in the absence or presence of the
   alternative oxidase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid. These different
   phenotype responses expressed under in vitro test conditions had no or
   only a slight impact on anthracnose control in protective applications
   of azoxystrobin. Isolate responses in vitro were very similar for
   trifloxystrobin, indicating cross-resistance among the class of QoIs.
   Our results imply that C graminicola falls into the class of pathogens
   with a potential for rapid selection of highly QoI-resistant phenotypes.
   Frequent monitoring of population sensitivities will be required to
   determine the status of population responses toward practical QoI
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Boating activities are an increasing source of physical damage to coral
   reefs worldwide. The damage caused by ship groundings can be significant
   and may result in a shift in reef structure and function. In this study
   we evaluate the status of two restoration projects established in 1995,
   6 years after two freighters, the M/V Maitland and the M/V Elpis, ran
   aground on reefs of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Our
   approach includes field monitoring in support of simulation model
   development to assess the effectiveness of the restoration efforts. A
   population model was developed for the coral Porites astreoides to
   project the convergence rates of coral abundance and population size
   structure between the restored and surrounding reference habitats. Coral
   communities are developing rapidly on the restoration structures.
   Species richness and abundance of the dominant coral, P. astreoides,
   were nearly indistinguishable between the restoration structures and
   reference habitats after only 6 years. However, although abundance and
   size structure of P. astreoides populations are rapidly approaching
   those of the reference habitats (a convergence in size structure within
   10 years was simulated), maximum coral size will take twice as long to
   converge for this species. The sensitivity of the model to maximum
   recruitment rates highlights the importance of recruitment on the
   recovery rates of restored habitats, suggesting that special attention
   should be afforded to provide coral recruits with appropriate
   recruitment substrate at the time of restoration. Finally, the rates of
   convergence and, hence, the level of success of a restoration effort
   were shown to be influenced not only by the recruitment and survivorship
   rates of corals on the restoration structures but by the characteristics
   of the reference population as well. Accordingly, reference populations
   ought to be considered a ``moving target{''} against which restoration
   success has to be measured dynamically. The simple, cost-effective,
   monitoring-modeling approach presented here can provide the necessary
   tools to assess the current status of a restoration effort and to
   project the time required for coral populations to resemble those found
   on undamaged reference habitats}},

Abstract = {{Daily growth rates were estimated from larval anchovy (Engraulis
   encrasicolus) sampled in their main nursery grounds off the Bay of
   Malaga (SW Mediterranean) during the 2000 and 2001 spawning seasons.
   Significantly higher growth rates were observed in the 2001 larval
   population, representing a 20\% increase through the larval size classes
   analysed. The decimated SW Mediterranean anchovy population experienced
   a successful anchovy recruitment during this year estimated at 13,000
   tons for the Bay of Malaga by the acoustic evaluation of small pelagic
   resources. The size distribution of the recruited anchovy juveniles
   during 2000 and 2001 showed an increase of approximately 2 cm. Their
   corresponding anchovy spawning seasonality agrees with the estimates
   from the growth model fits of each year. Data on the environmental
   back.-round for the two years sampled are provided by a historical
   quarterly monitoring project. Zooplankton showed a two-fold significant
   increase during July 2001, coastwise as well as offshore. No significant
   changes in surface temperature were observed between years. Instead of
   the usual summer spawning peak, anchovy peak spawning shifted towards
   early spring during the 2001 spawning season. The study provides
   evidence from field data on the relationships of larval growth
   variability and recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial dispersal of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, was
   monitored with an Allison-Pike(R) insect suction trap at the Texas
   Agricultural Experiment Station, Lubbock, Texas in 1989, 1992, 1993 and
   1994. This suction trap collected a single male A. gossypii on 2
   December 1992, the first confirmed report of the male form of A.
   gossypii in the Texas High Plains. A combined total of 13 male morphs
   were collected by the suction trap and from cotton plants near the trap
   site. In an effort to establish a method of predicting infestations in
   cotton, cotton aphid suction trap collections were compared to field
   densities in a nearby cotton field. Results indicated that suction trap
   collections during the growing season were not predictive of cotton
   aphid field population densities. However, numbers of cotton aphids
   collected by suction trap in November may be predictive of spring field
   population densities.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) populations have
   been associated in part with habitat loss and degradation, including
   that resulting from urbanization. We monitored the productivity and
   examined nesting habitat of loggerhead shrikes nesting in an urban
   environment in Tucson, Arizona. We located 22 breeding pairs in 1997 and
   26 breeding pairs in 1998, with a 72\% breeding area reoccupancy between
   years. Mean fledgling numbers were 2.28/nesting attempt and
   3.11/successful nest. Although some pairs initially failed and renested,
   91\% and 73\% of shrike pairs successfully fledged young in 1997 and
   1998, respectively. Mayfield estimates of nesting success were 78\% in
   1997 and 65\% in 1998. Nest sites were characterized by more trees >3 in
   in height, taller nest trees than those randomly available, and a
   greater proportion of bare ground surface than at random sites. Shrike
   breeding territories had lower proportions of residential and commercial
   development and greater proportions of open areas with low-growing
   vegetation than randomly available. Some shrikes nested in school
   playgrounds, residential front yards, and parking lots, if adjacent open
   space was available.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, very little is known about the normal dynamics of microbial
   populations in wastewater treatment systems and the relationship between
   population dynamics and functional stability of treatment systems. We
   monitored the bacterial community in an oxygen activated sludge system
   at a pulp and paper mill during a 55-day period that included normal
   operation as well as an 11-day shutdown of the system and the subsequent
   start-up. Ribosomal intergenic spacer (RIS) length polymorphism
   fingerprints were very similar (57-88\% similar) throughout the study
   period. Analysis of clone libraries of RIS-rRNA gene amplicons indicated
   that Proteobacteria affiliated with the genera Paracraurococcus and
   Acidovorax as well as a Green Nonsulfur Bacterium affiliated with the
   genus Roseiflexus were consistently among predominant members of the
   community. By comparison, wastewater treatment systems from different
   pulp mills yielded dissimilar fingerprints (9-17\% similar), and their
   clone libraries had distinct predominant phylotypes. Our analysis
   strongly suggests that the composition of the bacterial community in the
   former treatment system was stable during normal operation as well as
   the shutdown and start-up. This stability coincided with functional
   stability, including consistent and nearly complete removal of
   biological oxygen demand. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A census of the Grand Manan Archipelago, New Brunswick, Canada, found
   nine seabird species nesting at 22 sites. Herring Gull (Larus
   argentatus) and Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) were the most widely
   distributed species, with a combined 89\% of all breeding seabirds in
   the region. Although fewer, the Great Blackbacked Gull (Larus marinus)
   and Black Guillemot (Cepphus grylle) were widely distributed. Other
   seabirds had more limited distributions; one Common Tern (Sterna
   hirundo) colony, three Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus)
   colonies and one mixed colony of Razorbill (Alca torda) and Common Murre
   (Uria aalge). Leach's Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) numbers were
   not determined, but were found nesting on three islands and were
   suspected to be nesting on two others. Comparisons with historical data
   showed increases in gulls, Razorbill and Common Murre, whereas eiders
   had remained relatively stable over the past two decades, but had
   decreased in recent years. Insufficient data are available to assess
   trends of other seabird species nesting around Grand Manan. Fluctuations
   in cormorant numbers may be a result of moving breeding sites. The
   recent decrease in eider numbers may be a consequence of low survival
   rates of young and increasing numbers of predatory gulls. Considerable
   discrepancies were observed between recent and historical gull numbers
   which may have resulted from 1) differences in survey methodology, and
   2) survey timing. This study provides estimates of breeding seabirds,
   which can be used as baseline data for future monitoring in the Grand
   Manan Archipelago.}},

Abstract = {{Although amphibians are increasingly being used to assess ecosystem
   function of compensatory wetlands, there are almost no long-term studies
   of responses to ecological restoration. Consequently, much uncertainty
   exists about the appropriate timeframes and best criteria for evaluating
   responses to wetland restoration. We studied aspects of pond
   colonization and long-term community dynamics in ponds created at a
   mitigation site in western North Carolina. We examined whether landscape
   variables influenced the initial colonization of 22 constructed ponds
   and conducted a long-term study of changes in species richness and
   community composition in ten constructed and ten reference ponds over
   seven breeding seasons. During the first year of pond filling, species
   richness and the number of egg masses of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica)
   and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) were positively correlated
   with pond size, depth, and hydroperiod but independent of distance to
   the nearest forest, paved road, or source pond. The ten constructed
   ponds in the long-term study first filled in 1996 and were larger,
   deeper, warmer, more oxygen-rich, and of longer seasonal hydroperiod
   than reference ponds. Seven species bred in the constructed ponds during
   the first year of filling, and species richness reached equilibrium
   within two years of initial pond filling. Most species colonized
   constructed ponds rapidly, but frequency of use by eastern newts
   (Notophthalmus viridescens) increased slowly over five years.
   Constructed ponds supported significantly more species than reference
   ponds, and the annual turnover rate of breeding populations was
   approximately 25\% for both pond types. Our data suggest that
   post-restoration monitoring for 2-3 years may be sufficient to
   characterize species and communities that will utilize ponds for the
   first decade or so after pond creation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on breeding site fidelity for a small,
   localized population of greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus
   inhabiting a highly altered and fragmented landscape in north-central
   Washington, USA. One hundred sixteen greater sage-grouse were captured,
   fitted with radio transmitters and monitored during 1992-1998. Of 19
   males captured as adults and nine captured as yearlings, one and four,
   respectively, were observed visiting two different leks. Of 78 females,
   24 were observed visiting at least two leks, and eight visited at least
   three leks. Although the incidence of multiple lek visitation was
   similar to what has been reported for other regions, the average of 10.2
   km distance between neighbouring leks was substantially further in
   north-central Washington. Average distance between a female's first nest
   and her renest was higher for yearlings (6.3 km) than for adults (2.0
   km). Successful females moved an average of 1.6 km and unsuccessful
   females moved 5.2 km to nest in subsequent years. Most distances between
   consecutive nests were < 3.0 km, but some females, including adults,
   moved > 20 km. These data suggest that fidelity of greater sage-grouse
   to nesting areas in north-central Washington is substantially lower than
   has been found for other populations. Although the relationship between
   behaviour of greater sage-grouse and regional habitat fragmentation is a
   possible explanation for these observations, we were not able to detect
   a correlation between fidelity and local habitat availability.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the response of greater sage-grouse Centrocercus
   urophasianus populations to different levels of exploitation. From 1995
   through 2002 we monitored breeding populations in areas closed to
   hunting, open to limited hunting (1-bird daily bag limit; 7-day season),
   and open to moderate hunting (2-bird daily bag limit; 23-day season). We
   used three approaches to assess the effects of hunting on sage-grouse
   populations. Results were consistent regardless of the method used and
   indicated that overall, areas closed to hunting had greater rates of
   increase for breeding populations than areas open to hunting (P =
   0.018). Limited or moderate rates of exploitation apparently slowed
   population recovery for sage-grouse. These effects may have been more
   pronounced for grouse occupying relatively xeric habitats close to human
   population centers or highly fragmented habitats. Our results suggest
   that hunting seasons for sage-grouse should generally be conservative
   and reflect both sage-grouse population trend and quality of habitat
   occupied by the population.}},

Abstract = {{Non-invasive genetic sampling of animal populations provides many
   potential benefits to wildlife biologists over traditional field methods
   that require trapping, handling, and repeated visits to the same study
   site. Non-invasive genetic methods can be time- and cost-effective and
   are pertinent to the study of rare, elusive, and threatened or
   endangered species. We evaluated the utility of fecal mtDNA analysis as
   a method to inventory the range of New England cottontails (Sylvilagus
   transitionalis), a species of conservation concern. We were able to
   consistently extract high-quality DNA from the fecal pellets of 3
   species of lagomorphs: New England cottontails, eastern cottontails (S.
   floridanus), and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). We found that
   season, sample age, and source species influenced extraction success. We
   amplified a 565 base portion of the mitochondrial genome, using the
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and identified species-specific
   restriction sites. We used this technique in a pilot field study to
   distinguish among 140 fecal samples of the 3 sympatric lagomorphs.
   Unequivocal species identification was possible for 98\% of the 133
   samples that amplified successfully. Therefore, we conclude that mtDNA
   analysis of fecal pellets is an efficient and reliable method to
   inventory and monitor lagomorph populations during the winter. Our
   approach can easily be extended, with minor modifications, to the
   monitoring of other herbivore species.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimates of pregnancy rate and litter size are essential to
   many studies of population dynamics. We examined the use of ultrasound
   for estimating pregnancy rate (the proportion of pregnant females in a
   population) and litter size and for monitoring fetal development and
   survival in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). We compared
   ultrasound-based estimates of fetal number in 16 females to either
   radiographic estimates of fetal number for the same females or to the
   number of newborn hares counted after parturition. With ultrasound we
   detected fetuses as small as 4 mm and at least 25 days before
   parturition. Ultrasound-based estimates of fetal number were correct for
   8 hares, low by I fetus for 6 hares, and high by 1 fetus for 2 hares.
   Sequential ultrasound examinations detected change in fetal size and
   position, and detected ceased or abnormal fetal development in 2 hares.
   Ultrasonography is an effective, minimally invasive tool to monitor
   fetal number and pregnancy rate. Application of the technique to other
   species would require familiarity with internal anatomy and training in
   operation of the ultrasound machine.}},

Abstract = {{Brood-parasitic cowbirds (Molothrus spp.) can severely impact host
   populations. Cowbird removal is the primary means of reducing
   parasitism. As an alternative to removal, we evaluated the reduction of
   cattle stocking rate as a tool to shift cowbird-breeding activity away
   from a breeding area of a sensitive host. Activity of radiotagged,
   female brown-headed cowbirds (M. ater) breeding on Fort Hood, Texas, a
   United States Army installation that contains a large population of
   federally endangered black-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla), was
   monitored 2 years before and 2 years after a reduction in cattle
   stocking rate. We predicted that cowbirds would respond to the reduction
   by shifting both foraging and breeding activities toward more distant
   herds of cattle. Reduction in stocking rate did not have the desired
   effect of shifting cowbird breeding areas off the study area, though
   parasitism rates were lower following the reduction. Following the
   reduction, cowbirds eventually shifted foraging activity off the study
   area to sites where more cattle were present and tended to commute
   greater distances between breeding and foraging sites. Assuming that
   commute distance between breeding and foraging sites was energetically
   limiting, the cost of the increased commute may have reduced the number
   of eggs produced by female cowbirds over the breeding season, thus
   reducing parasitism. Effectiveness of our stocking rate reduction, even
   when applied at a large scale (9,622 ha), was reduced by the presence of
   alternative foraging sites within distances that cowbirds were willing
   to commute. Removal of cowbirds by trapping likely will remain the most
   effective means of maintaining a sustainable black-capped vireo
   population on Fort Hood.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of the size or density of wildlife populations are essential
   for effective management. Aerial surveys often are the only practical
   way of obtaining these estimates for large mammals ranging over a large
   area. Different aerial survey techniques are available. This paper
   reports on a study that estimated abundance and population density of
   wild horses (Equus caballus) in the Australian Alps using helicopter
   aerial surveys. Three frequently used techniques were compared
   simultaneously: strip counts, mark-recapture, and line transect. Using
   data on horse groups over a strip width of 200 m, estimates of horse
   abundance from mark-recapture analyses were higher ((N) over cap =3,045
   modified Petersen and (N) over cap =3,298 Huggins estimators,
   respectively) than from strip counts ((N) over cap =1,814 and (N) over
   cap =2,242 for observers 1 and 2, respectively). Use of line-transect
   analysis yielded the highest estimates of abundance ((N) over cap
   =5,200-5,830, population density (D) over cap =1.86-2.09 km(-2)). The
   coefficient of variation (CV) of estimates varied from 22\% for strip
   counts (0-50 m) to 28\% for mark-recapture analysis (0-50 m) and 31-32\%
   for line-transect analysis (0-200 m). Mark-recapture estimates of horse
   abundance from the modified Petersen estimator were substantially lower
   when the strip width was 200 m ((N) over cap =2,061) compared with a
   strip width of 50 m ((N) over cap =4,345). These results suggested that
   in aerial surveys using strip or mark-recapture analyses, the effect of
   wide strip width should be examined; otherwise estimates may be strongly
   negatively biased. Observer I estimated mean group size of 4.91+/-0.61
   SE horses and observer 2 estimated mean group size as 3.79+/-0.57 SE
   horses. Mean group size observed from the ground was 5.65+/-0.51 SE. We
   recommend that aerial surveys be implemented periodically using
   line-transect methodology to monitor trends in wild horse abundance in
   the Australian Alps.}},

Abstract = {{The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem contains the rare combination of an
   intact guild of native large carnivores, their prey, and differing land
   management policies (National Park versus National Forest; no hunting
   versus hunting). Concurrent field studies on large carnivores allowed us
   to investigate activities of humans and carnivores on Yellowstone
   National Park's (YNP) northern boundary. Prior to and during the
   backcountry big-game hunting season, we monitored movements of grizzly
   bears (Ursus arctos), wolves (Canis lupus), and cougars (Puma concolor)
   on the northern boundary of YNP. Daily aerial telemetry locations
   (September 1999), augmented with weekly telemetry locations (August and
   October 1999), were obtained for 3 grizzly bears, 7 wolves in 2 groups
   of I pack, and 3 cougars in 1 family group. Grizzly bears were more
   likely located inside the YNP boundary during the pre-hunt period and
   north of the boundary once hunting began. The cougar family tended to be
   found outside YNP during the pre-hunt period and moved inside YNP when
   hunting began. Wolves did not significantly change their movement
   patterns during the pre-hunt and hunting periods. Qualitative
   information on elk (Cervus elaphus) indicated they moved into YNP once
   hunting started, suggesting that cougars followed living prey or
   responded to hunting activity, grizzly bears focused on dead prey (e.g.,
   gut piles, crippled elk), and wolves may have taken advantage of both.
   Measures of association (Jacob's Index) were positive within carnivore
   species but inconclusive among species. Further collaborative research
   and the use of new technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS)
   telemetry collars will advance our ability to understand these species,
   the carnivore community and its interactions, and human influences on
   carnivores.}},

Abstract = {{After an extreme flood in Lake Constance in 1999 the Phragmites
   australis belt showed a severe decline in area and vitality. A three
   year monitoring project was installed in 2000 to document the die-back
   and rehabilitation process immediately afterwards, to identify the
   co-factors of the damage, and to find out significant stressors that may
   impede the recovery of the reeds. The monitoring is based on CIR aerial
   photo interpretation, quantitative GIS analyses and field investigations
   on shoot density, stand structure and biomass production in 50
   monitoring plots, grouped in five degrees of damage. In result we found
   that c. 0.306 km(2) of aquatic reed bed area died back at Lake
   Constance-Untersee (i.e. 23\% of the former area in 1998). Among the
   stands which had survived the severely damaged stands were mainly
   composed of secondary shoots, whereas primary and insect infested shoots
   dominated in less damaged stands. The development from 2000 to 2001 was
   characterized by an overall decrease in shoot density, a change in the
   composition of the shoot population in favour of primary shoots, and in
   a recovery in culm stature. All variables depended on the degree of
   initial damage by the extreme flood. A conceptual model is proposed to
   assess the future development of Lake Constance reeds.}},

   respectively. Interestingly, in winter, W-Zp and B-Zp/B-Phyt are also
   significantly larger for L. Peipsi compared with L. Vortsjarv: W-Zp 1.2
   and 0.7 mug, B-Zp/B-Phyt 0.4 and 0.1, respectively. This difference is
   caused by E. gracilis (Sars) and Cyclops kolensis Lilljeborg which are
   still living in L. Peipsi, but have disappeared from L. Vortsjarv. From
   the 1960s up to the present W-Zp has decreased appreciably. Correlation
   analysis showed the weak relationship between the studied
   characteristics and nutrient content, while the relationship between
   mean weight and water nutrient content is more pronounced in the
   strongly eutrophic L. Vortsjarv than in L. Peipsi. There was a positive
   correlation between W-Zp and the biomass of the genus Daphnia in L.
   Peipsi, while in L. Vortsjarv W-Zp was positively correlated with the
   biomass of Chydorus sphaericus. In L. Vortsjarv, W-Zp was negatively
   correlated with the abundance and biomass of rotifers, as well as with
   the abundance of zooplankton comprised primarily of rotifers. A clear
   difference in both characteristics was revealed in the comparison of
   Lakes Peipsi and Vortsjarv with ANOVA (p-level 0.002-<0.0001 for the
   years 1997-2001). W-Zp and B-Zp/B-Phyt characterize both the trophy and
   the whole ecosystem of a body of water. Indirectly, they characterize
   dominating groups in phytoplankton and zooplankton, feeding
   relationships between phyto- and zooplankton and between zooplankton and
   fish, as well as the pressure of fish on zooplankton. The W-Zp and
   B-Zp/B-Phyt can be used as marker characteristics in the evaluation of
   the trophy of a body of water and its ecosystem and, particularly, in
   permanent monitoring of bodies of water.}},

Abstract = {{The suite of birds associated with naturally occurring shrublands and
   early successional forests in the northeastern US accounts for about
   15\% of the total species diversity of the breeding avifauna of the
   region. Most of the species in this habitat suite are common to abundant
   in occurrence with moderate to high relative abundance in the region.
   The shrubland suite of birds contributes a relatively large number of
   individuals but a relatively small proportion ( 15\%) of the total bird
   species to the avian diversity of the region. The primary risks to
   long-term persistence of this suite of birds in the northeastern US
   include long-term population declines associated with long-term declines
   in amounts of early successional forest and naturally occurring
   shrubland habitats in the region (currently <15\% of the land area).
   Many shrubland birds also have relatively high proportions of their
   total breeding populations occurring in the region, indicating the
   importance of the northeastern US to maintaining source populations of
   these species. Partners in Flight (PIF), a cooperative bird conservation
   organization seeking to maintain populations of North American landbirds
   has developed bird conservation plans for 12 geographic planning units,
   called physiographic areas, in the northeastern US. In 10 of these 12
   physiographic areas, the shrubland suite of birds is considered either a
   high or moderate priority for conservation action. Most shrubland birds
   can be considered species of conservation responsibility rather than
   species of immediate concern. Species of conservation responsibility
   require long-term conservation planning and population monitoring to
   ensure that adequate habitat will be maintained and long-term threats
   eliminated. Fifteen shrubland bird species (45\% of the habitat suite)
   were identified as species of conservation responsibility in the region.
   In comparison, 40\% of the grassland suite and 34\% of the forest suite
   of birds were identified through the PIF plans as species of
   conservation responsibility in the region. Therefore, the PIF plans
   indicate that the suite of shrubland birds should receive a high degree
   of conservation attention within the northeastern US. Using the concept
   of historic range of variation, managing 10-15\% of the landscape for
   early successional habitat might provide adequate habitat for
   maintaining minimal populations of shrubland birds in the region, but a
   greater percentage will be needed if population increases are desired
   for birds associated with early successional habitats. Published by
   Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The light response of starburst amacrine cells is initiated by glutamate
   released from bipolar cells. To identify the receptors that mediate this
   response, we used a combination of anatomical and physiological
   techniques. An in vivo, rabbit eyecup was preloaded with
   {[}H-3]-choline, and the {[}H-3]-acetylcholine (ACh) released into the
   superfusate was monitored. A photopic, 3 Hz flashing light increased ACh
   release, and the selective AMPA receptor antagonist, GYKI 53655, blocked
   this light-evoked response. Nonselective AMPA/kainate agonists increased
   the release of ACh, but the specific kainate receptor agonist, SYM 2081,
   did not increase ACh release. Selective AMPA receptor antagonists, GYKI
   53655 or GYKI 52466, also blocked the responses to agonists. We conclude
   that the predominant excitatory input to starburst amacrine cells is
   mediated by AMPA receptors. We also labeled lightly fixed rabbit retinas
   with antisera to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), AMPA receptor
   subunits GluR1, GluR2/3, or GluR4, and kainate receptor subunits GluR6/7
   and KA2. Labeled puncta were observed in the inner plexiform layer with
   each of these antisera to glutamate receptors, but only GluR2/3-IR
   puncta and GluR4-IR puncta were found on the ChAT-IR processes. The same
   was true of starburst cells injected intracellularly with Neurobiotin,
   and these AMPA receptor subunits were localized to two populations of
   puncta. The AMPA receptors are expected to desensitize rapidly,
   enhancing the sensitivity of starburst amacrine cells to moving or other
   rapidly changing stimuli. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Title = {{Effect of varying monoterpene concentrations on the response of Ips pini
   (Coleoptera : Scolytidae) to its aggregation pheromone: implications for
   pest management and ecology of bark beetles}},

Abstract = {{1 Host plant terpenes can influence attraction of conifer bark beetles
   to their aggregation pheromones: both synergistic and inhibitory
   compounds have been reported. However, we know little about how varying
   concentrations of individual monoterpenes affect responses.
   2 We tested a gradient of ratios of alpha-pinene, the predominant
   monoterpene in host pines in the Great Lakes region of North America, to
   Ips pini's pheromone, racemic ipsdienol plus lanierone.
   3 Ips pini demonstrated a parabolic response, in which low
   concentrations of alpha-pinene had no effect on attraction to its
   pheromone, intermediate concentrations were synergistic and high
   concentrations were inhibitory. These results suggest optimal release
   rates for population monitoring and suppression programmes.
   4 Inhibition of bark beetle attraction to pheromones may be an important
   component of conifer defences. At terpene to pheromone ratios emulating
   emissions from trees actively responding to a first attack, arrival of
   flying beetles was low. This may constitute an additional defensive role
   of terpenes, which are also toxic to bark beetles at high
   concentrations.
   5 Reduced attraction to a low ratio of alpha-pinene to pheromone, as
   occurs when colonization densities become high and the tree's resin is
   largely depleted, might reflect a mechanism for preventing excessive
   crowding.
   6 Thanasimus dubius, the predominant predator of I. pini, was also
   attracted to ipsdienol plus lanierone, but its response differed from
   that of its prey. Attraction increased across all concentrations of
   alpha-pinene. This indicates that separate lures are needed to sample
   both predators and bark beetles effectively. It also provides an
   opportunity for maximizing pest removal while reducing adverse effects
   on beneficial species. This disparity further illustrates the complexity
   confronting natural enemies that track chemical signals to locate
   herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes extinction patterns for two species of orb spiders
   monitored annually on 77 islands over a continuous 20-yr period. One
   species, Argiope argentata, has large populations sometimes crashing
   quickly to extinction and a much weaker relation of extinction
   likelihood to population size than does the other species, Metepeira
   datona. Demographic models were built for both species and matched
   against observations. Differences between the species in life-history
   traits - estimated with measurements from the field together with
   incorporation of demographic stochasticity, a population ceiling, and
   environmental stochasticity, were necessary to fit the observed
   extinction curves. As predicted from life-history patterns, long-term
   population growth rates ( and hence predicted extinction probabilities)
   are relatively very sensitive to values of juvenile survivorship. Models
   are also sensitive to variation in the population ceiling and
   environmental noise, which tend to act in a complementary manner. A
   simple model with no age structure was able to fit the data on large
   initial population sizes but not on small initial population sizes,
   showing that life cycle characteristics interact with the various
   sources of stochasticity and hence have to be taken into account to
   produce a precise model of the extinction process.}},

Abstract = {{The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) breeds in Sicily and, in 22
   years of monitoring, has shown a decline followed by a slight recovery.
   We used Generalised Linear Models to predict: (1) the distribution
   range, (2) the habitat selection within the range, (3) the quality
   (i.e., occupation rate, breeding success) of breeding sites. Some 60\%
   of Sicily proved to be unsuitable, being either too densely forested and
   without cliffs for nesting, or too densely populated, along with
   intensive agriculture. The models converged, indicating that the pairs
   select a precise upland habitat where low cliffs, distant from urban
   areas, are surrounded by arboreal crops and Mediterranean vegetation.
   The variables predicting the quality of a site are also related to human
   disturbance, including the distance from a road or the presence of heavy
   traffic. Natural restocking, in the last 3 years, is occurring in quiet
   sites and in proximity to extensive grazing land rich in sheep and goat
   herds. These results focused on short-term programmes for local
   management of the species aimed at protracting the natural restocking:
   namely, the activation of (1) a stable system of artificial feeding
   stations, (2) nest site protection with joint activities for increasing
   public awareness, (3) a reintroduction project, by hacking, of juveniles
   born in captivity in Italian and European breeding centres.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation are main causes for Asian elephant
   population declines. We mapped wildlands - large, unfragmented and
   undeveloped areas - asking: (1) Where are the largest wildlands that
   constitute elephant habitats? (2) What proportion of these wildlands is
   protected? (3) What is their potential for elephant conservation? Our
   study demonstrates that wildlands constitute only 51\% of the Asian
   elephant range. Myanmar has the largest wildland (similar to170,000
   km(2)), followed by Thailand and India. In Principal Components Analysis
   (PCA), the first two components explained 73\% of the variation in
   fragmentation among ranges. We identified three fragmentation clusters
   from the PCA. Cluster A contains large ranges with unfragmented
   wildlands; cluster B includes ranges with well-developed transportation
   networks and large human populations; and cluster C contains ranges with
   severely fragmented wildlands. In cluster A, we identified four ranges
   with elephant populations >1000 animals: ARYO, MYTJC, BNMH and BITE.
   Together with ranges that support >1000 elephants in cluster B, these A
   ranges have great potential for long-term elephant conservation. We
   propose that fragmentation clusters and population size can be used to
   identify different elephant monitoring and management zones.}},

Abstract = {{Acetamiprid resistance in the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella
   (L.) from cabbage fields of Iwaoka-cho, Kobe City, where acetamiprid is
   the primary insecticide for DBM control, was monitored from 1999-2001.
   The results showed only a slight change in the susceptibility of the
   population over the monitoring period, considering the LC50 values and
   their corresponding resistance ratios (RRs). However, the LC95 values
   showed a significant shift towards acetamiprid resistance, suggesting
   that the population could develop higher levels of resistance to the
   insecticide in the future. To retard the progress of acetamiprid
   resistance, growers rotate acetamiprid with other insecticides. We thus
   evaluated the efficacy of five other insecticides to identify
   efficacious products to be used with acetamiprid. Results indicated that
   the population was moderately resistant to esfenvalerate and phenthoate,
   and tolerant to cartap. The population was, however, susceptible to
   chlorfluazuron and a preparation of Bacillus thuringiensis (btk).
   Incorporating chlorfluazuron and btk into the resistance management
   tactic adopted in Iwaoka-cho is thus a sound option.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{The probabilistic ecological risk assessment-toxic equivalent (PERA-TE)
   combination approach was recently introduced in response to the
   increased demand for risk assessment approaches that can accommodate
   mixtures. The effectiveness and validity of the PERA-TE approach was
   assessed using two types of pesticide mixtures tested in outdoor
   microcosms. The first type of mixture consisted of pesticides with
   similar modes of action (the organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos
   and diazinon) and the second of pesticides with different modes of
   action (chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and trifluralin). To assess the
   toxicity of, and potential interaction within, each type of mixture,
   theoretically equitoxic TE mixtures were prepared in different
   proportional ratios. The TE mixtures were based on the 10(th) centile of
   acute toxicity effects distributions (data obtained from the literature)
   and a factor of the sum of the 90(th) centile field concentrations
   extrapolated from exposure distributions based on North American surface
   water monitoring data. Changes in zooplankton population abundances were
   used as the effect measure. The binary organophosphorus mixtures were
   equitoxic and conformed to the concentration addition model. The
   observed response trends of zooplankton exposed to the mixture of
   chemicals with different modes of action were a result of the
   susceptibility of individual taxa to the dominating pesticide in each
   mixture. Overall, the PERA-TE approach was not effective in predicting
   the toxicity and interaction of all mixture types and should be limited
   to assessing mixtures of chemicals with similar modes of action.}},

   in Washington. Parasitism of AEM increased 4- to 5-fold over that
   produced by preexisting natural enemies between 1989 and 1994 at 22
   monitored sites. Subsequently, the wasp dispersed up to 20 km from
   release sites. A. fuscicollis also parasitized the cherry ermine moth,
   Yponomeuta padellus (L.), which was discovered in the Pacific Northwest
   in 1993. A total of 1813 individuals of Herpestomus brunnicornis
   (Gravenhorst) from France, Korea, and Japan were released in 1989-1991,
   and 26 wasps were recovered in 1994-1995. From 1989 to 1991, 2647
   Diadegma armillata (Gravenhorst) individuals from France were released.
   D. armillata was recovered at one site in 1991 two months following
   release, but no other recoveries have been made. A total of 8274
   Eurystheae scutellaris (Robineau-Desvoidy) individuals were released in
   1989 to 1991. However, this tachinid has not been recovered. A
   consistent decline of AEM populations occurred in 1989-1995, including
   at sites where A. fuscicollis was not recovered, suggesting other
   factors also contributed to this pest's decline. Now well established in
   western Washington, A. fuscicollis may help suppress future outbreaks of
   Y. malinellus and its congener, Y. padellus. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Capsule A comparison between North American and European ornithology
   shows many differences between the two.
   Summary While local knowledge was developed over millennia in Europe, in
   North America much was originally learned from the indigenous people.
   Knowing the food value of wild game was essential to survival and led to
   a strong tradition of wildlife management in North America. However,
   there was also systematic exploration of the local avifauna by
   museum-based collectors. This dual origin of ornithology is still
   detectable today. North American ornithology, particularly through the
   introduction of the Migratory Birds Convention Act of 1917, is strongly
   influenced by federal, state and provincial governments who have a
   statutory responsibility for the protection of wild birds. Because the
   USA and Canada, and more recently Mexico, are responsible for the
   administration of the Act, many initiatives in bird conservation involve
   international co-operation, starting initially with the North American
   Waterfowl Management Plan, but now extended to all species of birds.
   Many partnerships involving government, professional and amateur
   ornithologists (e.g. Bird Studies Canada) have resulted in monitoring of
   bird populations similar to that done by the BTO. However, there still
   seems to be a paucity of population studies and survey information in
   the mainstream ornithological journals in North America.}},

Abstract = {{Capsule A review of its methodology, analytical procedures and uses.
   Aims To provide a comprehensive review of the UK Nest Record Scheme
   (NRS), its methodology and value to science and conservation.
   \textbackslash{}Methods We reviewed the history of the development and
   current methodology used in the analysis of NRS data in the scientific
   literature and unpublished documents and from our personal knowledge.
   Results The British Trust for Ornithology's (BTO's) NRS is the largest,
   longest running and most highly computerized such scheme in the world.
   Advanced and efficient techniques of data gathering, data capture and
   analysis are used. It was founded in 1939 to provide information on the
   breeding biology of birds, but has since developed into a key component
   of the overall monitoring strategy for birds in the UK. A range of
   specialized analytical methods is available for NRS data and potential
   biases need careful treatment. More than 250 scientific publications
   have used NRS data to describe aspects of basic breeding biology and
   performance, to study the population dynamics of bird populations and to
   investigate the demographic causes of bird population declines in the
   UK.
   Conclusions Extensive long-term monitoring schemes, such as the NRS,
   that collate large historical data sets will become increasingly
   valuable for monitoring the impact of environmental change. While
   aspects of the NRS, its recording methods, data capture and analysis can
   be developed further, the scheme will continue to advance our
   understanding of both the impacts of new environmental stresses in the
   UK and the effectiveness of new conservation measures in the wider
   countryside. This has been amply demonstrated by its use for exploring
   the impacts of global climate change on the UK's avifauna.}},

Abstract = {{Capsule Extinction of ancient frugivores during the Quaternary has led
   to a depauperated seed disperser community for Laurus nobilis and a
   tight mutualism between the plant and the Blackbird Turdus merula.
   Aims To describe a present-day frugivore assemblage of natural Laurel
   populations in southern Spain.
   Methods Eight fruiting trees of different size were monitored with
   binoculars during 52 hours spread across one ripening season, and the
   identify and behaviour of foraging birds were recorded. Additional point
   counts were used to record the avifauna of the surroundings.
   Results Despite a diverse frugivore community being present, Laurel
   fruits are almost exclusively (99\%) consumed by Blackbird and rarely
   (1\%) by Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla. Blackbirds concentrate at fruiting
   trees and individuals may remain there for several days. Birds usually
   forage in small groups and return at intervals of 12-14 minutes.
   Conclusion The Blackbird population of the study area forages
   extensively on the energy-rich Laurel fruits, while the plants depend
   exclusively on this bird species for seed dispersal. Consequences of the
   depauperate frugivore community and the fight mutualism between
   Blackbirds and Laurels on plant recruitment and conservation are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the elevation of seawater temperature on the
   relationship between growth and viability of corals and various
   physiological parameters of their symbiotic zooxanthellar populations
   was examined for two hermatypic species, the scleractinian coral
   Stylophora pistillata (Esper) and the hydrocoral Millepora dichotoma
   (Forskal). Elucidation of this linkage between seawater temperature and
   the physiological status of these reef-building organisms was
   facilitated by a combination of our unique, high-resolution,
   computer-controlled set up and direct monitoring techniques. At
   34degreesC, zooxanthellar densities in M. dichotoma colonies decreased
   significantly; whereas, those in S. pistillata colonies increased. These
   different responses of the two species are probably an expression of
   their different tolerance mechanisms to elevated temperatures. For both
   species, chlorophyll a concentrations increased at 34degreesC, while
   those of chlorophyll c decreased. Elevation of seawater temperature
   above 26degreesC caused decrease in calcification rates. Our study
   indicates that 31.1degreesC is the critical point for the
   zooxanthellae-host association, and further temperature elevation may
   bring the animal host into the lethal range of survival.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium (Cd) is a ubquitous element and a significant inorganic
   pollutant that has previously been found to bioaccumulate in
   reproductive organs of fish and disrupt important endocrine processes,
   especially those involved in synthesis, release and metabolism of
   hormones. Clearly, there is potential for reproductive effects in fish
   populations exposed to Cd, however, few studies have investigated the
   non-lethal consequences of Cd in fish. To this extent, adult male and
   female Japanese medaka were exposed to 0-10 ppb Cd for 7 weeks.
   Reproductive endpoints, were monitored during weeks 6 and 7 of exposure
   and compared to physiological responses along the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, including plasma vitellogenin
   (VTG), hepatic estrogen receptor (ER), plasma steroids, gonadal-somatic
   indices (GSI), and gonadal steroid release. There were no observed
   effects on VTG and ER by long-term Cd exposure. However, gonadal steroid
   release was significantly decreased in males and females at all exposure
   concentrations and female plasma estradiol levels were significantly
   altered at concentrations higher than 5 ppb Cd. Overall, responses along
   the HPG axis were more sensitive to Cd exposure than the reproductive
   and developmental endpoints, which were not affected in this study,
   indicating that higher level impairment in fish might be relatively
   protected. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation, fragmentation, and loss of native sagebrush (Artemisia
   spp.) landscapes have imperiled these habitats and their associated
   avifauna. Historically, this vast piece of the Western landscape has
   been undervalued: even though more than 70\% of all remaining sagebrush
   habitat in the United States is publicly owned, <3\% of it is protected
   as federal reserves or national parks. We review the threats facing
   birds in sagebrush habitats to emphasize the urgency for conservation
   and research actions, and synthesize existing information that forms the
   foundation for recommended research directions. Management and
   conservation of birds in sagebrush habitats will require more research
   into four major topics: (1) identification of primary land-use practices
   and their influence on sagebrush habitats and birds, (2) better
   understanding of bird responses to habitat components and disturbance
   processes of sagebrush ecosystems, (3) improved hierarchical designs for
   surveying and monitoring programs, and (4) linking bird movements and
   population changes during migration and wintering periods to dynamics on
   the sagebrush breeding grounds. This research is essential because we
   already have seen that sagebrush habitats can be altered by land use,
   spread of invasive plants, and disrupted disturbance regimes beyond a
   threshold at which natural recovery is unlikely. Research on these
   issues should be instituted on lands managed by state or federal
   agencies because most lands still dominated by sagebrush are owned
   publicly. In addition to the challenge of understanding shrubsteppe
   bird-habitat dynamics, conservation of sagebrush landscapes depends on
   our ability to recognize and communicate their intrinsic value and on
   our resolve to conserve them.}},

Abstract = {{Fecal glucocorticoid assays provide a potentially useful, noninvasive
   means to study physiological responses of wildlife to various stressors.
   The objective of our study was to validate a method for measuring
   glucocorticoid metabolites in Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura) feces. We
   validated the assay using standard procedures (e.g., parallelism,
   recovery of exogenous corticosterone) to demonstrate that the assay
   accurately and precisely measured glucocorticoid metabolites in Mourning
   Dove fecal extracts. We conducted adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) challenge
   experiments to validate the assay's ability to determine biologically
   important changes in fecal glucocorticoids. Fecal glucocorticoid levels
   increased significantly approximately 2-3 hr after administration of
   ACTH at 50 IU per kg body mass to wild Mourning Doves held in captivity.
   In contrast, fecal glucocorticoid metabolites did not increase in
   control birds, birds that received saline injections, or a lower dose of
   ACTH (1 IU per kg body mass). Variation in overall fecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite levels may have been influenced by season and the length of
   time birds were held in captivity. Noninvasive fecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite analyses, in combination with demographic information, may
   have considerable utility for monitoring the effects of natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances on Mourning Dove populations.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed population trends from a constant-effort mist-netting study
   conducted in central coastal California during the autumns of 1979-1999.
   Of 31 taxa captured in sufficient numbers, 16 underwent statistically
   significant declines and none increased. Twice as many species declined
   from 1989-1999 as compared to 1979-1989. Overall, our results were
   similar to those of regional Breeding Bird Surveys determined for the
   same species during the same period. In an attempt to identify possible
   causes for trends, we grouped species by various life-history categories
   including nest height, nest type, likelihood of cowbird parasitism,
   wintering location, winter food preference, and tolerance for human
   presence on the breeding grounds. All groups underwent significant
   declines, although high nesters, common cowbird hosts, and Neotropical
   migrants declined faster than their respective counterparts. While
   life-history attributes explained differences in trends between groups,
   there was significant heterogeneity of trends within groups. Capture
   rates of certain species and groups appeared to be affected by various
   climate variables, and accelerating declines since 1990 may reflect
   effects of large-scale climate cycles, particularly on long-distance
   migrants. We suggest that long-term population trajectories of songbird
   populations across North America may be better understood in the context
   of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Interpretation of our results is, in
   some cases, problematic due to the complex interaction of methodological
   limitations and environmental variables, especially habitat change on
   the study site. We recommend the use of multiple methods and multiple
   sites for monitoring trends in songbird population abundance during fall
   migration.}},

Abstract = {{We studied a specialist parasitoid (Coccobius fulvus Compere et Annecke;
   Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), its host (the arrowhead scale, Unaspis
   yanonensis Kuwana; Hemiptera: Diaspididae) and the host plant (Citrus
   unshiu Marc; Rutaceae) to examine the indirect effects, via
   host-parasitoid interactions, of the parasitoid on plant biomass. We
   compared plant biomass and herbivore abundance in a system of two
   trophic levels (plants and herbivores) with a system of three trophic
   levels (plants, herbivores and parasitoids) using enclosure experiments
   in an agricultural setting. Each of eight young Citrus trees was
   infested with 40 scales and placed in an enclosure. We introduced three
   female parasitoids into half of the enclosures and monitored temporal
   changes in scale density and cumulative parasitism for the subsequent 11
   months. Plant biomass was then compared between treatment groups
   (parasitoids added) and controls (parasitoids excluded). During the
   experiment, cumulative parasitism increased rapidly in the
   parasitoid-addition enclosures to a maximum of 89\%, and the number of
   live scales in the control enclosures was approximately 10-fold that in
   the treatment enclosures. At the end of the experiment, plant biomass
   was threefold higher in the parasitoid-addition enclosures than in the
   control enclosures. These results have two implications for terrestrial
   communities. First, specialist parasitoids, which are the principal
   natural enemies of most herbivorous insects, can trigger trophic
   cascades in the same way that generalist predators can. Second,
   cascading effects can be detected by observing changes in plant biomass.
   The latter finding is contrary to recent conclusions about top-down
   cascades (i.e. that trophic cascades are less likely to be observed when
   plant biomass, rather than plant damage, is considered as the
   plant-response variable).}},

Abstract = {{Environmental pollution that renders waters along the coastline and
   beaches unsatisfactory for use by the general public has become a global
   health problem. This study was conducted to examine the effects of
   pollution of beach waters and sediment at seven selected locations
   receiving land drainage along a 45-km stretch of the east coast near
   Visakhapatnam, India. Pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard
   methods of culturing on selective media. The Pollution Index (PI) was
   determined as the ratio of fecal coliform/fecal streptococci. Protozoan
   cysts and helminth ova were also identified by microscopic examination
   of water after appropriate staining. The results suggested that the
   beach waters in Visakhapatnam are hygienically poor. A high PI of the
   water in Lawson's Bay indicated that the water was unsuitable even for
   noncontact recreation (boating, etc.). Pathogen densities dissipated
   considerably from the source to the low tide mark. Sediments had
   significantly higher bacteria] and protozoan populations but pathogen
   concentrations were low except in heavily used areas. The general
   distribution pattern suggests that the nature of the sediment has a
   significant role in the retention of bacteria, protozoan cysts, and
   soil-transmitted helminths. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the fungicide copper oxychloride on a field population of
   the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa were investigated. Changes were
   monitored in earthworm numbers and biomass, copper concentrations in
   soil and earthworms, and neutral red retention times (NRRTs) of
   coelomocytes. The aim was to establish whether the cellular responses
   could be linked to changes at the population level. Results indicated
   that there was a significant (P<0.05) impact on worm density and biomass
   on the treated plots 6 months after spraying with the fungicide stopped.
   NRRTs of treated earthworms were significantly lower after one spraying
   when earthworms had elevated concentrations of copper in their body
   tissues. Six months after spraying stopped, copper levels in both soil
   and earthworm tissues declined significantly, but the earthworm numbers
   and biomass were still significantly lower in the treated plots. This
   indicated that the effects of the copper oxychloride exposure manifested
   at a much later stage at the population level, than on NRRT. We conclude
   that the decrease in NRRTs, which preceded the decrease in both
   earthworm biomass and numbers, may have predictive value as a biomarker
   of impending population changes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All

Abstract = {{No previous reports exist on polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE)
   congeners in human milk from individual U.S. mothers. This article on
   PBDEs is an extension of our previous studies on concentrations of
   dioxins, dibenzofurans, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other chlorinated
   organic compounds in human milk in a number of countries. PBDE
   commercial products are used as flame retardants in flexible
   polyurethane foam (penta-BDE), in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resins
   (octa-BDE), and in high-impact polystyrene resins (deca-BDE). Their use
   is permitted in the United States but is banned in some European
   countries because of presumed toxicity, demonstrated persistence, and
   bioaccumulation. Different commercial products can be found in various
   consumer products such as television sets, computers, computer monitors
   and printers, carpets, and upholstery. Analyses of human levels of these
   compounds suggest low but rising levels in European human milk, which
   may have peaked, at least in Sweden, in the late 1990s. Very few data
   exist on levels of PBDEs in humans in the United States, and none from
   milk from individual nursing mothers. To address this issue, we analyzed
   47 individual milk samples from nursing mothers, 20-41 years of age,
   from a milk bank in Austin, Texas, and a community women's health clinic
   in Dallas, Texas. Up to 13 PBDE congeners were measured. The
   concentrations of the sum of PBDE congeners varied from 6.2 to 419 ng/g
   (or parts per billion) lipid, with a median of 34 ng/g and a mean of
   73.9 ng/g lipid. The PBDE levels in breast milk from Texas were similar
   to levels found in U.S. blood and adipose tissue lipid from California
   and Indiana and are 10-100 times greater than human tissue levels in
   Europe. Their detection in breast milk raises concern for potential
   toxicity to nursing infants, given the persistence and bioaccumulative
   nature of some of the PBDE congeners. These results indicate a need for
   more detailed investigation of the levels of PBDE in people and food, as
   well as determining if animal fat in food is the major route of exposure
   of the general U.S. population. Other routes of intake may also be
   significant.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of
   naturally Occurring oil sands-related compounds (OSRC) on reproductive
   function in fish in order to assess the impacts of anthropogenic
   point-source inputs. The health of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) and
   pearl dace (Semotilus margarita) collected from the Alberta Athabasca
   Oil Sands (Canada) watershed were examined. Two rivers were selected for
   study: the Steepbank and the Ells. These rivers originate outside the
   oil sands formation, where fish are unexposed (Ref), exposed to
   naturally Occurring oil sands-related compounds (Nat), or exposed to
   naturally occurring compounds as well as adjacent to surface mining
   activity (Dev). Assessment endpoints included gonadosomatic indices
   (GSI). fecundity, and in vitro gonadal steroid production. In vitro
   gonadal incubations demonstrated lower levels of steroid Production at
   sites along the Steepbank River within the oil sands deposit. Hepatic
   7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, an indicator of exposure
   to OSRC, was elevated twofold at the site with natural compounds and up
   to 10-fold Lit the site adjacent to development compared to EROD
   activity in fish from the reference site. Fish collected in the Ells
   River had a threefold induction in EROD activity but no significant
   reduction in steroid production when compared to reference fish. No
   consistent alterations in gonadal development were seen in fish
   collected from sites within the oil sands deposit. This research in the
   Athabasca River basin provides baseline information of the health of
   fish populations within the oil sands deposit prior to further
   development in the area.}},

Abstract = {{American robins (Turdus migratorius) breeding in the Housatonic River
   (MA, USA) watershed were studied in the field in 2001 to determine
   whether productivity was adversely affected by exposure to
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as Would be suggested by extrapolation
   from laboratory studies on other avian species. The Study involved
   identifying nests within the Housatonic River floodplain (target area)
   and in reference areas beyond foraging distance of the floodplain,
   monitoring clutch size and number hatched and fledged, collecting eggs
   and nestlings for analysis for PCBs, and testing for differences in
   productivity between populations. One hundred and six active robin nests
   were monitored. Although concentrations of PCBs in target specimens were
   more than two orders of magnitude greater than in reference specimens,
   the only statistically significant differences in productivity were
   inconsistent with an exposure-related effect. First-generation
   productivity of exposed robins was within the range of natural
   background variation. Bioequivalence tests confirmed that
   first-generation productivity was statistically and biologically
   equivalent in target and reference robins. These findings contrast with
   extrapolations from laboratory studies of other avian species.}},

   Well-fed pups from the Baltic Sea had concentrations of DDT, PCBs. and
   HCHs that were 2 to 10 times higher than in corresponding pups from
   populations in the Atlantic Ocean. The OC pattern in the Baltic seals
   differed significantly from that of their Atlantic relatives. reflecting
   the predominance of regional point Source inputs into file Baltic Sea
   and long-range atmospheric inputs into the Atlantic Ocean. The
   difference, in the pattern of the compounds also indicated an enhanced
   metabolism of the more metabolizable Compounds in the more contaminated
   Baltic seals. Surprisingly, the proportions of the high chlorinated and
   low-volatile PCB congeners (>6 Cl atoms) were comparable of lower in the
   Baltic pups as compared to the Atlantic pups. This difference might be
   due to Baltic seals occupying a lower trophic level than Atlantic seals
   and/or to the eutrophication Situation in the Baltic Sea, which causes
   sedimentation of these PCB congeners. Significantly higher OC
   concentrations were found in starved and/or abandoned Baltic pups as
   compared to well-fed pups. The most contaminated Baltic seal Pups in the
   present study had PCB concentrations that are comparable or higher than
   those reported to impair the immune systems and vitamin A dynamics in

Title = {{Experimental manipulation of habitat structure: a retrogression of the
   small mammal succession}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1. The habitat accommodation model for animal succession proposed that
   animal species enter a succession when changes in the vegetation
   succession reach a threshold of habitat suitable to that species. As the
   vegetation succession moves on, the habitat becomes less suited to that
   species and it is competitively excluded by species better suited to the
   habitat.
   2. The main species in the mammalian succession following fire for wet
   heath in eastern Australia are rodents, with Pseudomys gracilicaudatus
   (eastern chestnut mouse) being followed by Rattus lutreolus (swamp rat)
   which becomes dominant with increasing time since fire. The abundance of
   both species has been shown to correlate with vegetation density, but in
   markedly different ways, and asymmetric interspecific competition has
   been demonstrated using controlled, replicated removal experiments in
   the field.
   3. We used this system to examine if vegetation density is causal,
   manipulating the habitat by clipping to remove 60-70\% of the vegetative
   cover from the 10 m x 10 m area surrounding each of six trapping
   stations on each grid. There were four experimental plots clipped, each
   with two abutting grids, one clipped and one unclipped, and a further
   four control plots each with two abutting grids that remained
   undisturbed.
   4. We monitored the effects on each species with three censuses in
   January 1993 (summer) before clipping in early February, and on five
   further censuses, three in February (late summer) to assess immediate,
   short-term effects, one in August (winter) and one in December 1993
   (early summer).
   5. The abundance of Rattus lutreolus was significantly reduced by
   clipping the vegetation, while the abundance of Pseudomys
   gracilicaudatus remained relatively unchanged by the clipping.
   6. Two species that are abundant on early succession stages in dry heath
   succession, but occurred at very low abundance on these wet heath
   habitats before clipping, P. novaehollandiae (New Holland mouse) and Mus
   domesticus (house mouse), showed marked increases in abundance on
   clipped and control plots soon after clipping.
   7. An abundance index based on the standardized difference between
   clipped and control plots, was used to assess responses to habitat
   manipulation. Rattus lutreolus demonstrated significant negative index
   values, Pseudomys gracilicaudatus had index values close to zero until
   the winter census, P. novaehollandiae and Mus domesticus showed positive
   abundance indices soon after clipping. The order of significant
   responses to the habitat manipulation was revealed as: Mus
   domesticus-->Pseudomys novaehollandiae--> P. gracilicaudatus--> Rattus
   lutreolus.
   8. The impact of a habitat manipulation experiment on these four species
   of rodents produced a retrogression of the small-mammal succession. This
   demonstrated a causal role for vegetation density, which provided
   insight into the mechanisms that operate during the succession following
   fire, and supported the habitat accommodation model for animal
   succession.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for sampling western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis
   (Pergande) (Thysan., Thripidae) in strawberry flowers were evaluated in
   three commercial plots by monitoring the population densities of adult
   and immature thrips throughout the growing season. Three types of
   flowers were sampled: open, senescent and petal fall, and three
   procedures were compared: a visual examination of flowers, a
   turpentine-funnel method and a shake method. Open flowers showed higher
   population densities of adults, whereas senescent or petal fall flowers
   had a higher number of eggs and more damage symptoms. Seasonal changes
   in population density were similar for the three sampling procedures,
   although the turpentine method recovered more insects, especially
   larvae, than the other two methods. The turpentine procedure was the
   most efficient as it extracted almost 100\% of adults and, in plots with
   no chemical sprays, nearly 100\% of second instars and 50\% of first
   instars. Regular control of thrips with pesticides reduced the
   percentage of larvae recovered with this procedure. The visual method
   spotted 80\% of adults and 33\% of larvae. The shake method extracted
   nearly 80\% of adults but only 18\% of larvae. The visual method is
   recommended for routine field samplings, especially for sampling adults
   and in plots regularly sprayed with pesticides, as it constitutes a
   cost-effective method when time and efficiency are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use by members of a wild population of American mink (Mustela
   vison) was evaluated by continuous monitoring of individuals that were
   live trapped and radiotracked year round in the Upper Thames region,
   United Kingdom. Spatially lagged autoregressive models were used to
   investigate the relationship between population abundance and measured
   habitat variables. Resident mink were found in places characterized by
   rich tree cover, plenty of scrub, rank grasses, and especially abundant
   rabbits, and they avoided open habitat characterized by farming
   activities. These trends were not detected, however, in either transient
   adults or juveniles. The presence of the opposite sex did not appear to
   influence the presence of resident mink of the other sex. The single
   most important feature influencing the presence of resident mink was the
   size of rabbit warrens. Warrens were, overall, the most important den
   sites for mink, especially for breeding females. Because the
   distribution of rabbit warrens seemed to be strongly affected by
   riverside farmland management, this might eventually determine the
   distribution and local population growth of feral mink in the Upper
   Thames region.}},

Abstract = {{A field survey was conducted in 2001 to evaluate resistance to
   pyrethroid and organophosphate (OP) insecticides on horn flies,
   Hematobia irritans irritans (L.), from seven ranches in the state of
   Tamaulipas, Mexico, and from three locations in central Texas. Filter
   papers impregnated with either technical permethrin or diazinon were
   used to measure the levels of resistance to pyrethroids and OPs. A
   multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used on individual
   horn flies from these field populations to detect the presence of the
   kdr and super-kdr alleles associated with pyrethroid resistance, and a
   mutated alphaE7 esterase allele associated with OP resistance. Relative
   to a susceptible laboratory (Kerrville) strain, born flies from Mexico
   exhibited 5.1- to 28.3-fold resistance to permethrin at the LC50, and
   23.8- to 136-fold resistance at the LC90. Horn flies from Texas ranches
   exhibited only two- to five-fold resistance. All field populations of
   the horn fly were highly susceptible to diazinon, and no mutant alphaE7
   esterase alleles were detected. The super-kdr allele was found only in a
   single fly from a ranch in Mexico. Results of PCR assays showed that the
   kdr allele was present at various frequencies in field populations of
   horn flies. A gender-related bias in distribution of kdr genotypes was
   found in horn flies from Mexico, but not in horn flies from Texas. The
   overall kdr allelic frequencies in horn flies from Mexico were
   23.2-37.8\% higher in females than in males. Regression analysis
   revealed a significant correlation between kdr allelic frequencies and
   the levels of knockdown resistance to permethrin among the horn fly
   populations studied. The results validate the role of the PCR-based
   molecular assay as a diagnostic tool in monitoring resistance to
   pyrethroids and also provide useful information on population genetics
   of horn fly resistance to pyrethroids and OPs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence associates the persistence of invasive plant species
   with disturbance and fluctuations in distinct forms of mineral N in
   soils. We conducted soil and hydroponic experiments to investigate the
   influence of N form and availability on germination and seedling
   development of 2 invasive annual grasses, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)
   and medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae) and 6 perennial grasses,
   blue-bunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), crested wheatgrass
   (Agropyron cristatum x A. desertorum), Sand Hollow and Seaman's Gulch
   big squirreltail (Elymus multisetus), and Little Camas and Little Wood
   bottlebrush squirreltail (E. elymoides ssp. brevifolius and E. elymoides
   ssp. elymoides, respectively). Seeds were sown in soils with no soil
   additions, barley straw (1 mg kg(-1)), NH4+ = 10 mg N kg(-1), NH4+ + I
   (nitrification inhibitor) = 10 mg N kg(-1) + 37 ml nitrapyrin, or NO3- =
   10 mg N kg(-1) to evaluate cumulative germination percentage for 20 days
   in an incubator. For the hydroponic experiment, grass seedlings were
   exposed to distinct forms and uniform concentrations of mineral N to
   monitor root and shoot growth for 21 days. Treatments were no N added,
   NH4+ (1 mM), NO3- (1 mM), and NH4NO3 (0.5 mM). Treatments did not alter
   germination in the soil experiment. Lack of soil N effect on seed
   germination is attributed to the absence of seed dormancy in the
   populations of grasses we evaluated. Initial root length and overall
   shoot growth of grasses were greater in the NO3- than in the NH4+
   treatment more frequently for perennial grasses. Root and shoot growth
   of medusahead and cheatgrass generally exceeded that of the other
   grasses except crested wheatgrass. However, relative decreases in root
   dry mass for the no N treatment were greater for the invasive annual
   grasses than the perennial grasses when compared to the N-addition
   treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial population changes were monitored immediately after the
   Nakhodka oil spill accident in January 1997 at the heavily
   oil-contaminated Mikuni coast along the Sea of Japan. The total cell
   number was almost stable for one year at 2-5 X 10(5) Cells mL(-1), while
   the relative occurrence of culturable heterotrophs and degraders of oil
   components such as C-heavy oil, kerosene, and n-tetradecane varied,
   showing a maximum (>50\% of the total) immediately following the
   accident. Gene amplification and phylogenetic analysis of a dilution
   culture using C-heavy oil as the sole carbon and energy source revealed
   that one of the predominant oil degraders at the oil-contaminated coast
   in 2 weeks after the accident closely resembled the aromatic hydrocarbon
   decomposer Cycloclasticus pugetii. Microbial community composition in
   oil-contaminated seawater was estimated at the molecular level using
   newly developed oligonucleotide probes, probe wash-off curve estimation,
   and quantitative fluorescence dot-blot hybridization techniques. At two
   different oil-polluted sites, harbor and intertidal regions, the C.
   pugetii group was estimated to make up 23-25\% of the total Bacteria
   population, followed by the aliphatic hydrocarbon decomposer Alcanivorax
   borkumensis, which formed 4-7\% of the Bacteria. In incubation
   experiments using floated oil slick and indigenous microbes collected at
   the harbor, oil degradation activities were enhanced by the addition of
   both organic and inorganic nutrients. Significant decreases were found
   in aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon fractions: 54-60\% and 22-24\% in
   2 weeks to 68-77\% and 23-32\% in 2 months, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Different experiments have estimated that the contribution of biological
   nitrogen fixation (BNF) is largely variable among sugarcane cultivars.
   Which bacteria are the most important in sugarcane-associated BNF is
   unknown. However, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus has been suggested as
   a strong candidate responsible for the BNF observed. In the present
   study, bacteria-free micropropagated plantlets of five sugarcane
   cultivars were inoculated with three G. diazotrophicus strains belonging
   to different genotypes. Bacterial colonization was monitored under
   different nitrogen fertilization levels and at different stages of plant
   growth. Analysis of the population dynamics of G. diazotrophicus strains
   in the different sugarcane varieties showed that the bacterial
   populations decreased drastically in relation to plant age, regardless
   of the nitrogen fertilization level, bacterial genotype or sugarcane
   cultivars. However, the persistence of the three strains was
   significantly longer in some cultivars (e.g., MEX 57-473) than in others
   (e.g., MY 55-14). In addition, some strains (e.g., PAl 5(T)) persisted
   for longer periods in higher numbers than other strains (e.g., PAl 3)
   inside plants of all the cultivars tested. Indeed, the study showed that
   the inoculation of G. diazotrophicus may be beneficial for sugarcane
   plant growth, but this response is dependent both on the G.
   diazotrophicus genotype and the sugarcane variety. The most positive
   response to inoculation was observed with the combination of strain PAl
   5(T) and the variety MEX 57-473. Although the positive effect on
   sugarcane growth apparently occurred by mechanisms other than nitrogen
   fixation, the results show the importance of the sugarcane variety for
   the persistence of the plant-bacteria interaction, and it could explain
   the different rates of BNF estimated among sugarcane cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the potential for using biological performance indicators
   (BPIs) to detect the overexploitation of populations of walleye Sander
   vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum) in Minnesota's large lakes. We
   developed equations to predict growth (i.e., the von Bertalanffy growth
   parameter and total length at age 3) and female age at 50\% maturity
   from growing season length and female total length at 50\% maturity from
   growth. Indices of spawning stock age diversity and the variation of
   population abundance were characterized by means of summary statistics.
   Thresholds for BPIs were determined by adding a measure of variability
   to the predicted and mean values. We evaluated the sensitivity of each
   BPI by comparing observed values with the thresholds for an
   overexploited population in Upper Red Lake. All six BPIs for Upper Red
   Lake exceeded the thresholds, demonstrating their potential use for
   monitoring walleye exploitation. However, the magnitude by which each
   threshold was exceeded differed by BPI, indicating that some may be more
   sensitive than others. Managers should integrate the performance of a
   suite of BPIs with time series analysis to identify the onset of
   overexploitation of large-lake walleye fisheries.}},

Abstract = {{Plant genomic resources harbouring gain-of-function mutations remain
   rare, even though this type of mutation is believed to be one of the
   most useful for elucidating the function of unknown genes that have
   redundant partners in the genome. An activation-tagging T-DNA was
   introduced into the genome of Arabidopsis creating 55 431 independent
   transformed lines. Of these T1 lines, 1262 showed phenotypes different
   from those of wild-type plants. We called these lines `AT1Ps'
   (activation T1 putants). The phenotypes observed include abnormalities
   in morphology, growth rate, plant colour, flowering time and fertility.
   Similar phenotypes re-appeared either in dominant or semi-dominant
   fashion in 17\% of 177 AT2P plants tested. Plasmid rescue or an
   adaptor-PCR method was used to identify 1172 independent genomic loci of
   T-DNA integration sites in the AT1P plants. Mapping of the integration
   sites revealed that the chromosomal distribution of these sites is
   similar to that observed in conventional T-DNA knock-out lines, except
   that the intragenic type of integration is slightly lower (27\%) in the
   AT1P plants compared to that observed in other random knock-out
   populations (30-35\%). Ten AT2P lines that showed dominant phenotypes
   were chosen to monitor expression levels of genes adjacent to the T-DNA
   integration sites by RT-PCR. Activation was observed in 7 out of 17 of
   the adjacent genes detected. Genes located up to 8.2 kb away from the
   enhancer sequence were activated. One of the seven activated genes was
   located close to the left-border sequence of the T-DNA, having an
   estimated distance of 5.7 kb from the enhancer. Surprisingly, one gene,
   the first ATG of which is located 12 kb away from the enhancer, showed
   reduced mRNA accumulation in the tagged line. Application of the
   database generated to Arabidopsis functional genomics research is
   discussed. The sequence database of the 1172 loci from the AT1P plants
   is available (http://pfgweb.gsc.riken.go.jp/index.html).}},

Abstract = {{The potato R locus is necessary for the production of red
   pelargonidin-based anthocyanin pigments in any tissue of the plant,
   including tuber skin and flower petals. The production of pelargonidins
   in plants requires the activity of dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) to
   catalyze the reduction of dihydrokaempferol into leucopelargonidin. To
   test the hypothesis that potato R encodes DFR, portions of both dfr
   alleles were sequenced from a diploid potato clone known to be
   heterozygous Rr. Sequence comparison revealed a polymorphic BamHI
   restriction site. The presence or absence of this site was monitored in
   three diploid populations that segregated for R, as well as in a wide
   range of tetraploid breeding clones and cultivars, by amplifying a
   fragment of dfr and digesting the products with BamHI. An identically
   sized dfr restriction fragment lacking the BamHI site was present in all
   potato clones that produced red anthocyanin pigments, while the same
   fragment was absent in many potato clones with white tuber skin and
   flowers. An independent RFLP test using DraI to detect sequence
   polymorphism was performed on a subset of the potato clones. This test
   also revealed dfr-derived bands that were present in all red-colored
   potatoes and absent in several white clones. The presence of shared
   restriction fragments in all red-colored potatoes provides strong
   evidence that R does indeed code for DFR. The data are also consistent
   with a 48 year-old hypothesis by Dodds and Long, that R was selected
   just once during the domestication of potato. A cDNA clone corresponding
   to the red allele of dfr was sequenced and compared to two other
   alleles. The red allele is predicted to encode a 382 amino acid protein
   that differs at ten amino acid positions from the gene products of the
   two alternative alleles. Several of these differences map in a region
   known to influence DFR substrate specificity in Gerbera.}},

Abstract = {{Diets of salmonines in Lake Michigan have been dominated by alewives
   Alosa pseudoharengus since the 1960s, and information on alewife
   population dynamics is critical to the management of salmonine
   fisheries. We monitored alewife size at age and condition (K) at several
   different locations in Lake Michigan during fall 1984-2001. Alewives
   were aged by enumerating annuli on otoliths. The results indicated that
   alewife length at age did not trend upward or downward between 1984 and
   the late 1990s but decreased from the late 1990s to 2001. Alewife weight
   at age was relatively constant between 1984 and the mid-1990s but
   decreased from the mid-1990s to 2001. Mean condition for a given alewife
   age was, on average, 13.7\% higher during 1984-1994 than during
   1995-2001. This decline in alewife condition was not a density-dependent
   response by the alewife population because alewife abundance trended
   neither upward nor downward during 1984-2001. The decline in alewife
   condition was possibly due to the lakewide decrease in the abundance of
   Diporeia spp. during the 1990s. Apparently, the availability of the
   large-bodied invertebrates Diporeia and Mysis spp. was an important
   regulator of adult alewife growth because alewives attained a
   substantially larger size in Lake Michigan, where these invertebrates
   were relatively important constituents of the adult alewife diet, than
   in Lake Ontario, where these invertebrates were not readily eaten by
   adult alewives. For age-2 or older females, mean length was 2-9 mm
   greater than for males. Alewife size at age and condition were slightly
   higher on the eastern side of Lake Michigan than on the western side.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms regulating bird populations are poorly understood and
   controversial. We provide evidence that a migratory songbird, the
   black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), is regulated by
   multiple density-dependence mechanisms in its breeding quarters.
   Evidence of regulation includes: stability in population density during
   1969-2002, strong density dependence in time-series analyses of this
   period, an inverse relationship between warbler density and annual
   fecundity, and a positive relationship between annual fecundity and
   recruitment of yearlings in the subsequent breeding season. Tests of the
   mechanisms causing regulation were carried out within the Hubbard Brook
   Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, during 1997-1999. When individuals
   from abutting territories were experimentally removed in a homogeneous
   patch of high-quality habitat, the fecundity of focal pairs nearly
   doubled, revealing a locally operating crowding mechanism. A
   site-dependence mechanism was indicated by an inverse relationship
   between population size and mean territory quality, as well as by
   greater annual fecundity on the sites that were most frequently occupied
   and of highest quality. These site-dependence relationships were
   revealed by intensive monitoring of territory quality and demography at
   the landscape spatial scale. Crowding and site-dependence mechanisms,
   therefore, acted simultaneously but at different spatial scales to
   regulate local abundance of this migratory bird population.}},

Abstract = {{Significant land-use changes have occurred in Western European rural
   regions since the 1950s, leading to standardisation of the landscape,
   and to the decline of the richness in terms of habitat for fauna and
   flora. This paper reports on a study of the dynamics of a typical
   landscape for these regions (North-Western part of Switzerland) at five
   periods of time (the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s) and its
   relation with the decrease of the population of the brown hare (Lepus
   europaeus). The socio-economical, ecological, climatic and
   geomorphologic states of 936 communes were described with 40 variables,
   obtained mostly from communal statistics, using a Geographical
   Information System (MapInfo). An Index of the Abundance of Hares (IAH)
   was calculated on 125 of these communes. Statistical analyses and PEGASE
   (a multivariate hierarchical divisive analysis method) were performed,
   using IAH as target variable, to identify the key-variables of the
   landscape for the hare. On basis of these key-variables, two scenarios
   for the future were constructed, leading both to negative consequences
   for the hare. Our procedure for analysing the landscape dynamics in
   relation to the population of brown hare proves to be original and
   useful. The result is a base of discussion for building a platform for
   the monitoring of the landscape and its capacity to be a suitable
   habitat for an animal. The brown hare was shown to be an appropriate
   part of a set of indicators to measure the intensification of the
   agriculture, the extension of urbanisation and the development of the
   road and rail networks. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A review of current research shows insufficient monitoring and testing
   have been conducted to reliably assess the degree of environmental risks
   posed by transgenic crops. The major risks include increased resistance
   to particular pesticides, gene flow into related plant species, and
   negative effects on non-target organisms. Significant gaps in knowledge,
   often stemming from missing markets for ecological services, warrant a
   cautious environmental regulatory approach for transgenic crops. The
   objective of this paper is to identify the types of ecological systems
   public research to implement effective biosafety controls. US biosafety
   regulatory processes tend to focus on controlling type I error, i.e.
   restricting the release of the crops when significant environmental
   risks do not exist, because the economic losses from denying
   commercialization can be estimated. However, the precautionary
   principle, which focuses on controlling type II errors, i.e. releasing
   the crops when serious ecosystem damage will occur, adds a necessary
   criterion given the current deficit in ecological science. The key
   challenge facing regulators is to find the appropriate balance of
   controlling type I versus type II errors. The research program should
   embed the lessons of evolutionary biology and ecological sciences.
   Viewing the plant as a production machine that can be ``brute-force{''}
   reengineered for more efficiency is a poor analogy. Unanticipated and
   unintended results, positive and negative, will emerge from such
   engineering because plants are complex systems embedded in poorly
   understood, complex, and interacting ecosystems.
   An ideal public research program should capture the interconnectedness
   of ecological systems, the essential roles of ecosystem services,
   nonlinear and threshold responses to accumulating stresses, and global
   expansion of the technology. Basic elements of such a program include
   long-term studies of cumulative and synergistic pesticide resistance
   effects, potential gene flow problems for those transgenic crop
   trait-weed complexes with high probabilities of outcrossing and
   ecological disruption, and scientific protocols for assessing
   deleterious effects on non-target organisms. For all three effects,
   expanded ecosystem monitoring of the commercialized crops in varied
   settings is needed for improved type II error definitions and estimates.
   The development of improved risk analysis methodologies and protocols
   should also be a priority. Finally, scientific effort to stimulate
   precautionary research, such as the development of transgenic crops that
   mimic ecological systems functioning, could avert many risks. Creating
   information to avoid significant ecological damages and foster
   precautionary research and development for transgenic crops are
   neglected roles of public biotechnology research. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Rangelands are among the most important agricultural ecosystems in the
   United States and the world. The rangelands of the western United States
   are fundamental to the rural economy. In order to maintain the quality
   of these rangelands, they must be monitored over time and space. The
   ecological condition of rangelands is a major factor in their
   environmental quality, in their overall performance as watersheds, and
   in wildlife and livestock production. The monitoring system must be
   science-based and take into account topography, climate, soils, plant
   communities, and animal populations that go to make up the western
   range. An information storage, processing, interpretation, and retrieval
   system must be included if the monitoring data are to be assessed in a
   timely manner. This report outlines a research program for the
   development of a new approach to monitoring rangelands. It includes the
   principle variables (climate, soils, plants, and grazing animals)
   involved in determining rangeland condition and trend as an indication

Abstract = {{The capability of agricultural producers to monitor the condition and
   trend of the rangelands on which they operate should not be limited to
   plant communities. The purpose of this article is to underscore the
   importance of monitoring wildlife populations and their critical
   habitats. Agricultural producers should be aware of the many wildlife
   species that inhabit public and private rangelands. Wildlife species
   should be part of their range monitoring program. Agricultural producers
   and their employees are present on specific rangelands more often than
   the state and federal employees that are mandated to manage the variety
   of resources on those rangelands. This presence, along with the
   observations and development of good note taking skills and
   documentation, will lead to a better understanding of the condition and
   trend of wildlife populations on various habitats. Such knowledge will
   benefit the resource as well as the agricultural operation. The
   objective of this monitoring program is to communicate with the various
   entities (state, federal, special interest) what you have learned and to
   help better understand the complexity associated with wildlife species
   and their habitats. This will improve the chances of making better
   management decisions on rangelands and integrated agricultural

Abstract = {{Ecological concepts serve as a foundation for developing a monitoring
   program to evaluate water quality and associated riparian systems.
   Ecological concepts used for developing a monitoring plan must be
   supported by scientific literature and related to streamflow dynamics
   and channel interactions. These interactions help determine natural or
   background habitat quality within and along river longitudinal and
   environmental gradients from mountains through basins in the western
   United States. In addition stream size, position in the watershed, and
   flow are related to sediment sorting, channel bank strength, and channel
   configuration. These relationships determine channel substrate habitat
   for aquatic organisms and population diversity. These habitat features
   may be modified by a channel's ability to store and transport sediment
   and associated pollutants within a watershed's drainage pattern.
   Sediment supply, delivery, and timing are altered by differences in
   snowmelt along elevation gradients, runoff from convective storms, water
   development history, and stream channel succession. Potential impairment
   of reference or background aquatic habitat in the western United States
   is generally sediment related and should be greater in basin river
   segments and during base flow conditions. Impairment sources can be
   shown to originate in the steep and first order tributaries of foothill
   and basin watersheds, and not from valley slopes where supply must cross
   established riparian zones. Water column, substrate disturbance, and
   channel bank disturbances may alter amount of sediment and bacteria
   pollution measured in basins and during base flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Nest predation is the primary cause of nest failure among birds. As
   such, it has large consequences on avian populations and is believed to
   be an important force in the evolution of avian life-history traits.
   Therefore, using a combination of laboratory and field research, we
   investigated the potential of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys
   sabrinus) and two species of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P.
   keeni) to be predators on eggs and nestlings of birds, particularly the
   threatened, canopy nesting Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus).
   In captivity, both mice and squirrels attempted to prey on eggs and live
   nestlings of various sizes. Mice attempted to prey on eggs more than
   nestlings, were more likely to attack nestlings when hungry than when
   sated, and were more likely to attack small than large nestlings.
   Individual flying squirrels varied in their propensity to attack but
   generally were more likely to attempt to open eggs when hungry than when
   sated. Opening of eggs by both mice and squirrels was limited by egg
   size. Video monitoring of artificial nests containing live nestlings
   confirmed that mice prey on large nestlings at canopy nests in
   Washington State's temperate rainforest. We conclude that mice and
   flying squirrels are predators of canopy nesting passerines, and their
   potential as nest predators must be considered to understand the
   consequences of nest predation. Received 1 April 2003, accepted 12 June

Abstract = {{The fundamental conservation focus for Hobe Sound National Wildlife
   Refuge (HSNWR), Florida is to provide protected nesting habitat for
   three threatened or endangered marine turtle species. Turtle nesting and
   hatching spans from early spring to fall each year. Left unchecked, nest
   predation by raccoons and armadillos would destroy most turtle nests.
   Predators are removed to protect nests, primarily with a one
   person-month contract using control specialists. We maximized the
   efficiency of predator removal by using a passive tracking index to: (1)
   optimize the timing and strategy for predator removal, (2) minimize
   labor by identifying areas where predator removal would have maximal
   effect, (3) examine beach invasion patterns of predators, (4) assess
   efficacy of removal efforts, (5) provide anticipatory information for
   future turtle nesting seasons, and (6) serve as a detection method for
   invasion by additional species known to depredate turtle nests. An
   overall nest predation rate of 28\% resulted, whereas the rate for the
   previous year was 42\% when the same level of contracted predator
   removal was applied, but without monitoring predators. One year before
   that, predator removal was done without contracts with specialists and
   predation was 48\%. Up to 95\% of the nests were destroyed in the years
   prior to predator removal. Using 2000 data on numbers of nests, clutch
   sizes, and emergence rates, we estimated the number of hatchlings that
   would have been lost assuming that the predation rates observed from
   four predator removal scenarios at HSNWR would have occurred in 2000.
   Historical predation of 95\% would have resulted in 120,597 hatchlings
   lost in 2000. Predator removal as part of regular refuge operations
   would have reduced this number to 62,481. Addition of a contract with
   control specialists would have further reduced the number lost to
   53,778. Addition of temporal and spatial monitoring for predator removal
   reduced losses to 36,637. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Many conservation organisations rely heavily on volunteers, and the
   government often relies on them to achieve tasks for which funding is
   insufficient-for example, the monitoring of trends in biodiversity on a
   national scale. Thus, it is critical to deploy nonprofessionals
   effectively. In this study we validated and calibrated the data
   collected by 155 volunteers, assisting with mammal monitoring at Wytham
   Woods, Oxfordshire, between April 2000 and December 2001. Tasks included
   small mammal trapping and handling, surveying and censusing for badgers,
   estimating deer population sizes from dropping counts, and transect
   surveys for mammal field signs. We analysed the effects of age, gender,
   previous experience, physical fitness and aptitude on volunteer
   performance using quantitative measures and qualitative scores. We found
   that (1) techniques that could be taught to volunteers without lengthy
   or specialist training were sufficiently accurate to yield reliable
   data, (2) with approximately half a day of training in each task,
   volunteers could produce reliable data, verified by professionals, and
   (3) volunteer teams brought considerable time savings to many tasks,
   compared with a single professional researcher. Our analyses show that
   physical fitness was a significant predictor of a volunteer's ability to
   perform tasks well and, in our particular sample, a male-bias in
   volunteer aptitude was apparent in some tasks. Previous experience as a
   conservation volunteer did not enhance performance over that of novices
   nor did age have any effect on volunteers' ability. The overall veracity
   of volunteer data compared well with data collected using more
   specialist methods or collected by professional researchers using the
   same method. Volunteers required more time per task and, while they
   showed a tendency to underestimate population sizes, their results were
   consistent. Additionally, the programme helped to raise the
   environmental awareness of volunteers and their understanding of
   woodland ecology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The western pond turtle Emys (formerly Clemmys) marmorata is declining
   throughout its range, primarily due to loss of habitat via urbanization
   and conversion to agriculture. Urban waterways present several important
   challenges to freshwater turtle populations, but they also present an
   opportunity to maintain declining species in a ubiquitous habitat that
   has high public visibility. The arboretum waterway on the University of
   California, Davis campus is an example of an extensively altered urban
   habitat that supports a relatively large E. marmorata population. Over
   the last 6 years, we monitored the turtle population inhabiting the
   arboretum waterway to determine the demographic health of the
   population, and the challenges and opportunities that urban environments
   pose for pond turtles. Since 1993, the naturally existing arboretum pond
   turtle population has declined by approximately 40\% and has shown
   little natural recruitment. During this time, we also introduced 31
   headstarted turtles into the arboretum. Headstarting is the process of
   raising juveniles in captivity until they have outgrown their period of
   greatest vulnerability to predators, and then releasing them into the
   wild. Our headstarting results demonstrate that this contentious
   strategy is a viable option for adding young turtles to the population,
   although it does not address the causes of decline. Over the course of
   our study, we encountered nine species of non-native turtles in the
   waterway, and these appear to be a serious threat to the native species.
   As more habitat becomes urbanized, it is increasingly important to
   understand how freshwater turtles, such as E. marmorata, adapt to urban
   waterways and the impact of non-native turtles on native turtle species.
   Our strong feeling is that urban waterways can provide habitat for
   viable populations of freshwater turtles and showcase them to the
   public, but both the aquatic and terrestrial habitat must be managed
   according to the biological requirements of individual species. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{We summarize the problems that populations of formerly common plants may
   encounter when habitat fragmentation isolates them and reduces
   population size. Genetic erosion, inbreeding depression, Allee-effects
   on reproductive success, catastrophes and environmental stochasticity
   are illustrated with studies on species that have recently become rare
   in The Netherlands due to habitat fragmentation. These clearly indicate
   that population viability is negatively affected. We also show that in
   the recent literature (since 1980), most studies on the conservation of
   rare plants have addressed population genetic structure and
   relationships between genetic variation and population size. Though
   important, these studies are not suitable for assessing the importance
   of genetics for population viability. In turn, demographic studies can
   detect changes in vital rates in small populations, but cannot reveal
   underlying genetic causes. Fitness and demographic studies are also
   well-represented in the literature, but remarkably few studies have
   attempted to integrate empirical demographic and genetic studies. We
   discuss two approaches to fill this very important lacuna in our
   knowledge. One of these constructs matrix-projection models on the basis
   of demographic censuses of-if possible-large and viable populations, and
   combines these with the results. of experiments to determine inbreeding
   effects on demographic transitions and, subsequently, population growth
   and extinction. The other approach is to demographically monitor
   experimentally created small and large populations with low and high
   genetic variation and measure their actual growth rates and
   probabilities of extinction. We conclude that demography and
   demographic-genetic experiments should play a central role in plant
   conservation genetics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The transfer of legal responsibilities from the Central Government to
   the Autonomous Communities ended a tradition of paying little attention
   to endangered Spanish flora. The studies undertaken to implement the
   European Natura. 2000 network, and to prepare regional `Red Data Books'
   and lists of protected flora offered a much better view of which species
   were really at risk. As a consequence, a growing number of botanists is
   now involved in different aspects of conservation biology. The recent
   publication of a new Spanish Red List of vascular flora has provided the
   groundwork for the so-called `Threatened Flora Atlas' project, which
   will update and homogenise the information on 500 taxa at risk. This
   project will produce a new Spanish Red Book and monitor the status of 40
   selected species. The Spanish strategy for plant conservation is
   discussed, pointing out some deficiencies, such as the neglect of
   non-vascular taxa, the uneven and sometimes uncoordinated local policies
   and the uncertain future of some current initiatives. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Populations of many phloem-feeding aphid species in temperate regions
   increase exponentially in early summer and then `disappear', usually
   over a time-scale of a few days, in July To understand these dynamics,
   empirical investigation of the causes and modelling of the processes
   underlying population change are required. Numbers of the aphids Myzus
   persicae (Sulzer) and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas), monitored over
   three years in commercial potato fields in the UK, increased to a
   maximum of 2-2.5 per leaflet on 16 July in 1999 and 2001, and then
   declined to < 0.25 per leaflet by 26 July. In 2000, aphid numbers
   remained very low (< 0.25 per leaflet) throughout the season. The onset
   of the crash in aphid numbers (16-19 July in 1999 and 2001) was
   consistently associated with changes in the phloem amino acid
   composition of potato leaflets. Natural enemies, including syrphids,
   parasitoids, coccinellids, chrysopids and entomopathogenic fungi,
   increased in abundance throughout the sampling period. The incidence of
   winged emigrant aphids prior to the crash was low (< 10\%). Experimental
   manipulation during 2001 demonstrated that, during the crash period, the
   fecundity of aphids (caged on leaves to exclude natural enemies) was
   depressed by 25-45\% relative to earlier in the season, and that
   presence of natural enemies reduced aphid numbers by up to 68\%. Using
   these data, an excitable medium model was constructed, which provided a
   robust description of aphid population dynamics in terms of plant
   development-induced changes in aphid fecundity and temporal change in
   natural enemy pressure.}},

Abstract = {{We constructed a database for the Southern California commercial
   passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fleet for the years 1959-1998 using the
   daily fish reports from the Los Angeles Times. This database includes
   information on number of fish caught by species, landing port, landing
   date, and number of anglers. Comparison of this database to the logbook
   database maintained by the California Department of Fish and Game shows
   high correlation.
   Angler effort has been consistent throughout the time series at about
   620,000 passengers per year. The annual fish catch averaged 4.25 million
   fish from 1963 to 1991 but has declined since 1992 to 2.5 million fish
   in 1998. The data show a decided decline in the CPFV catch of rockfish
   species since the early 1980s; a possible consequence of this decline
   appears to be a shift in effort toward less utilized species over the
   past decade, most notably ocean whitefish, California scorpionfish,
   cabezon, and more recently sanddabs.
   The CPFV fishery not only provides a recreational opportunity to
   residents and visitors to southern California but also contributes to
   local economies. This fleet's catches, combined with those of private
   recreational anglers, are substantial enough to impact fish populations,
   particularly in regional areas. The database, which will be available on
   the NOAA-NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center Web site and updated
   regularly, provides a means of monitoring fisheries trends in real time.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in stream water temperatures created by local influx of
   cooler subsurface waters into geomorphically complex stream channels was
   associated with increased abundance of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in northeastern
   Oregon. The addition of cold water patch frequency and area as
   explanatory variables in salmonid habitat models indicated that doubling
   of cold water patch frequency was associated with increases in rainbow
   trout and chinook salmon abundances of 31\% and 59\%, respectively.
   Doubling of cold water patch area was associated with changes of 10\% in
   rainbow trout abundance but was not associated with chinook abundance
   after accounting for other habitat factors. The physiognomy,
   distribution, and connectivity of cold water patches, important
   attributes determining the effectiveness of these habitats as thermal
   refuges for stream fishes, were associated with channel bedform and
   riparian features. Monitoring of thermal heterogeneity and salmonid
   populations in response to ongoing habitat restoration efforts will
   provide additional insights into causal relationships among these
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain reproductive synchrony
   exhibited by many species of large herbivores: the predation hypothesis
   and the seasonality hypothesis. Although examples supporting both
   hypotheses have been presented, no study has compared the intraseasonal
   progression of parturition and plant phenology in depredated and
   non-depredated populations of large herbivores. We monitored, on a daily
   or near-daily basis, the progression of the caribou (Rangifer tarandus)
   calving seasons in two populations: the Caribou River population in
   Alaska, U.S.A., where predators of caribou are present and the
   Kangerlussuaq-Sisimiut population in West Greenland where such predators
   have been absent for approximately 4000 years. Simultaneously, we
   quantified directly the phenological progression of caribou forage
   plants on spatially replicated plots in both study sites. Parturition
   was significantly more synchronous in the West Greenland (predator-free)
   population than in the Alaskan (depredated) population. Progression of
   the calving seasons in both populations was highly synchronized to the
   progression of forage plant phenology, and the slopes of these
   relationships were statistically indistinguishable, with 50\% of births
   having occurred when approximately 60\%-70\% of forage plant species
   were emergent. These results document clear synchronization of the
   timing of parturition by caribou to plant phenology, regardless of
   predation pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The time course of ambient benzene level and benzene discharge was
   investigated. Data obtained by continuous monitoring and monthly
   monitoring showed a decreasing trend of ambient benzene level. The rate
   of decrease was around 22-25\% per two years from FY 1997 to FY 1999.
   The discharge data of benzene reported by several organizations were
   collected and re-arranged to estimate the total discharge in Japan. The
   total amount of benzene discharged decreased by 25\% from 1997 to 1999.

Abstract = {{A global market in seafood disperses many live organisms to distant
   locations. These organisms can be released into environments of the new
   locations, where they can establish reproductive populations. The risks
   of such introductions remain poorly resolved. We therefore surveyed
   bivalves (oysters, mussels, and clams) that are commercially available
   as seafood in the western United States. Twenty-four of the 37 available
   marine and estuarine bivalve species are nonindigenous. Eleven of these
   24 nonindigenous species have established, self-sustaining populations
   in northeast Pacific environments. Three of the remaining 13
   nonindigenous species have been introduced outside their natural ranges
   elsewhere in the world. We estimated the risks of some of these species
   being introduced by performing binomial probability analyses on these
   data. Our results suggest that there is a significant risk of
   introducing live seafood species into northeast Pacific ecosystems.
   Efforts to warn distributors and consumers to screen imported seafood
   species for invasiveness, to monitor estuaries and coastal ecosystems
   for early detection, and to develop rapid-response plans for containing
   new invaders are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Surface waterblooms of toxic cyanobacteria (scums) interfere with the
   use of lakes, for instance in the production of drinking water or for
   recreation. Routine monitoring data are not sufficient for early warning
   due to the large temporal and spatial variability in the occurrence of
   surface waterblooms, and the time lag between the formation of the scum
   and the availability of relevant information for risk management. We
   combined a ``traditional{''} dynamic simulation model based upon
   differential equations with fuzzy logic to describe the three main
   conditions governing surface waterbloom formation: (1) a preexisting
   population of cyanobacteria, (2) buoyancy of the cells, and (3)
   stability of the water column. The attributes and membership functions
   of the fuzzy model were based on earlier field studies of diel changes
   in buoyancy and vertical distribution of cyanobacteria. The model was
   applied without further calibration to the large lake IJsselmeer (1200
   km(2)) in the Netherlands, and we validated the model output using 12
   years of NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers) satellite
   images on which surface blooms are discernible as an enhanced vegetation
   index or increased surface water temperature. Existing surface blooms
   were predicted with high accuracy, but additional blooms were also
   predicted. A statistical test (Cohen's Kappa) showed that correct
   predictions of the absence or presence of surface blooms were highly
   unlikely to have occurred by chance only. The model can be used to
   predict the occurrence of surface waterblooms in advance on the basis of
   the long-term weather forecast, leaving time for appropriate management
   of the problem. The lake management has expressed interest in converting
   the present model into a fully operational-online-early warning system.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the attention that has been focused on the importance of
   traditional, shade coffee production for biodiversity, little is known
   about the relative conservation value of different systems of managing
   the shade canopy. We surveyed fruit-feeding butterfly species richness
   and vegetation structure on different shade coffee management systems in
   Chiapas, Mexico, that ranged from intensive commercial to traditional,
   rustic systems. The impact, of management on the diversity and structure
   of the shade canopy in each coffee production system was quantified and
   compared using a Management Index. This Management Index revealed
   statistically significant differences between management systems that
   previously were distinguished by researchers using qualitative,
   ``gestalt{''} categories. Butterfly species richness was found to
   decline as management intensity increased, but a significant drop was
   found between the rustic system and the other more intensive systems,
   corroborating the importance of preserving rustic, shade coffee
   production for the conservation of biodiversity. Fruit-feeding
   butterflies were found to be very sensitive to the intensification of
   management of the shade canopy, so they may be an effective way to
   monitor ecological changes that accompany intensification within the
   coffee agroecosystem. Additionally, the vegetation Management Index may
   prove useful for quantifying management practices to evaluate
   certification criteria for conservation benefits.}},

Title = {{Do frugivores respond to fruit harvest? An experimental study of
   short-term responses}},

Abstract = {{Many nonexperimental studies have shown positive correlations between
   resource abundance and vertebrate abundance. These relationships,
   however, are difficult to interpret because of confounding factors that
   may independently determine the abundance of vertebrates and their
   resources. Moreover, verifying links between vertebrate and resource
   abundance is complex because human perception of resource abundance may
   differ from that of nonhuman vertebrates and because manipulating
   resource abundance on an ecologically meaningful scale is difficult.
   We studied the dependency of frugivores on fruit abundance in eastern
   Amazonian floodplain forests dominated by one species of palm tree
   (Euterpe oleracea) from which people harvest fruit. We first compared
   spatial and temporal use by frugivorous parrots of four sites dominated
   by E. oleracea and four sites with no E. oleracea. Parrots spent 48-92\%
   more time in the former, where their activity over the fruiting season
   mirrored the abundance of fruits. To test whether fruit abundance was
   the mechanism underlying these patterns, we removed fruit at two
   intensities in replicated 1.8-ha plots, and then monitored responses of
   frugivorous birds and mammals. High-intensity removal (75\% of ripe
   fruit harvested) significantly reduced the number of frugivorous bird
   individuals by 29\% and the length of frugivorous bird visits by 68\%,
   relative to controls. In contrast, low-intensity removal (41\% of ripe
   fruit removed) had no impact on these metrics. Frugivore species
   richness did not differ among treatments and controls, but the
   composition of the frugivore community was altered by harvest, with the
   presence of 11 species being linked to fruit abundance. Nonfrugivorous
   birds did not respond to either intensity of fruit harvest. The number
   of fruit-eating mammal species was 58\% lower in both the low- and
   high-removal treatments, relative to control plots.
   These results verify that fruit abundance influences the species
   composition of frugivore communities and the abundance and foraging
   behavior of individual species. They also document short-term dependency
   of fruit-eating mammals on fruit abundance. Harvest of fruit from forest
   systems, a common practice in tropical forests, therefore can affect
   populations of fruit-eating animals.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitism rates of the normative tachinid fly, Compsilura concinnata

   (Actias luna (L.)) were determined in central Virginia, where both C.
   concinnata and the gypsy moth, its biocontrol target, have become
   established in the past few decades. In a forest that has not yet had
   gypsy moth damage, we placed cohorts of second through fifth instar
   Actias luna caterpillars on understory hickory trees. At the end of each
   instar, surviving caterpillars were collected and reared. Four
   parasitoid species and two hyperparasitoid species emerged from the
   caterpillars and pupae. C. concinnata was the most common parasitoid,
   attacking 0\% to 62\% of the caterpillars recovered in each instar.
   Hyperparasitism of C. concinnata by trigonalid wasps was high: 47\% and
   16\% in the two generations. UV light census data indicate that current
   saturniid populations in this area of central Virginia are robust, but
   the long-term effects of C. concinnata introductions on populations of
   these and other native macrolepidoptera should be monitored.}},

Abstract = {{Field sampling plans are proposed for monitoring Helicoverpa armigera
   (Hubner) populations on cotton and for threshold insecticide treatment
   in sub-Saharan Africa. The geostatistical analysis of the spatial
   distribution of bollworms validates systematic sampling (along a
   diagonal for example); systematic sampling is easier to perform than
   random sampling. The same negative binomial distribution was observed in
   Burkina Faso and Cameroon under controlled conditions, with or without
   insecticide treatment. The low infestation levels prevented the use of
   the approximate methods of Iwao or Kuno. Hence, exact confidence
   intervals not available in the literature are presented in graph form.
   Sequential and fixed size sampling methods are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Colony and population genetic structure was determined for
   Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) and Reticulitermes virginicus (Banks)
   collected from Sentricon Termite Colony Elimination System monitoring
   stations at an apartment complex in Raleigh, NC. Once in each of 2000,
   2001, and 2002, samples of termites were collected from monitoring
   stations just before the installation of bait tubes containing 0.5\%
   hexaflumuron. Twenty workers from each sample were genotyped at five
   microsatellite loci. Comparison of worker genotypes among samples
   provided unambiguous colony associations. Analysis of worker genotypes
   within colonies coupled with estimates of F-statistics and nestmate
   relatedness showed that three fourths (30) of the 41 R. flavipes
   colonies and all three of the R. virginicus colonies were simple
   families headed by pairs of outbred monogamous reproductives. The
   remaining R. flavipes colonies were extended families, apparently headed
   by a few neotenic reproductives. Most colonies appeared to be localized,
   occupying only a single monitoring station. Termite pressure was
   initially heavy, with up to five colonies present around a single
   building simultaneously, but it progressively decreased over time. Of 35
   R. flavipes colonies and I R. virginicus colony baited in 2000 or 2001,
   only a single R. flavipes colony was found again 1 yr later, but this
   colony was not detected the following year. These results suggest that
   although treatment with hexaflumuron bait successfully suppresses or
   eliminates Reticulitermes spp. colonies, new colonies can quickly move
   into areas vacated by treated colonies, but over time continuous baiting
   can reduce termite pressure and effectively protect structures.}},

   PCB-153, and PCB-180 in juvenile foxes relative to adult animals.
   Further data analysis demonstrated that the observed difference was
   attributable to an age-dependent reduction of PCB concentrations in
   females, whereas male foxes retained approximately the same PCB burden
   throughout their life span. A similar sex-related bias between
   population members has been observed, primarily in marine mammals.
   Interestingly, the reduction of organochlorine contents with progressive
   age is reminiscent of human studies, where an extensive maternal
   transfer of xenobiotics to the offspring has been shown to result in
   increased exposure levels of infants relative to adults. To our
   knowledge, this is the first example of an urban wildlife species that
   faithfully reflects the dynamic distribution of toxic contaminants in
   the corresponding human population. Suburban and urban foxes occupy
   habitats in close proximity to humans, depend on anthropogenic food
   supplies, are relatively long-lived and readily available for sampling,
   can be easily aged and sexed, have a limited home range, and, therefore,
   meet several important requirements to serve as a surrogate species for
   the assessment of toxic health hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in marine ecosystems can be manifested in many different ways,
   on different temporal and spatial scales. Seabirds are top consumers in
   marine foodwebs and offer opportunities to detect and assess the
   biological effects of changes in physical parameters (sea-surface
   temperature {[}SST], salinity, depth of thermocline etc.) of the marine
   ecosystem. We compare six-eight years' of data on the biology ( diet,
   and breeding success) of four species of seabird ( arctic tern Sterna
   paradisaea and common tern S. hirundo, which feed at the sea surface;
   and Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica and razorbill Alca torda, which
   dive 30 - 60 m for their prey) breeding on Machias Seal Island (MSI) in
   the Bay of Fundy with both our own meteorological and oceanographic
   measurements, and with standard measurements from conventional sources.
   These are compared with fisheries data on changes in the main prey of
   all the seabirds concerned ( juvenile or `0-group' herring Clupea
   harengus) which are the most direct link between the seabirds and the
   physical properties of the marine system. We explore relationships
   between seabird productivity and diet, and other aspects of both herring
   biology ( larval surveys, and fat content) and oceanography ( SST data
   from the island, and remotely sensed data from the entrance to the Bay
   of Fundy). Timing of laying by puffins followed SST variation at neither
   the local ( MSI) nor regional scales, but at the scale of the North
   Atlantic, following the trend of populations breeding off northern
   Norway. The proportion of herring in the diet of terns over 6 years
   varied inversely with herring larval abundance the previous fall; this
   relationship was not statistically significant in the puffin and
   razorbill. A major new finding is the considerable (similar to50\%)
   inter-annual variation in the energy density ( fat content) of juvenile
   herring that are the main seabird prey; breeding success of both species
   of tern varied in parallel with the energy density of juvenile herring
   in the diet until the last two years of the study, when sandlance
   (Ammodytes sp.) and euphausid shrimp predominated in the diet. Our
   long-term research approach combines traditional population monitoring (
   of numbers of breeding birds) with demographic, behavioural and
   environmental monitoring, to provide new understanding of the marine
   ecosystem as well as of seabirds.}},

   - determination of secondary and primary phthalate monoester metabolites

Abstract = {{A number of phthalates and their metabolites are suspected of having
   teratogenic and endocrine disrupting effects. Especially the
   developmental and reproductive effects of di(2-ethythexyl)phthalate
   (DEHP) are under scrutiny. In this study we determined the
   concentrations of the secondary, chain oxidized monoester metabolites of
   DEHP, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)phthalate (5OH-MEHP) and
   mono(2-ethyl-5-oxo-hexyl)phthalate (5oxo-MEHP) in urine samples from the
   general population. The utilization of the secondary metabolites
   minimized any risk of contamination by the ubiquitously present
   phthalate parent compounds. Included in the method were also the simple
   monoester metabolites of DEHP, dioctylphthalate (DOP),
   di-n-butylphthalate (DnBuP), butylbenzylphthalate (BBzP) and
   diethylphthalate (DEP). Automated sample preparation was performed
   applying a column switching liquid chromatography system enabling online
   extraction of the urine on a restricted access material (RAM) and
   separation on a reversed phase analytical column. Detection was
   performed by negative ESI-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction
   monitoring mode and quantification by isotope dilution. The excretion of
   DEHP and the other phthalates was studied by analyzing first morning
   urine samples from 53 women and 32 men aged 7-64 years (median: 34.2
   years) living in northern Bavaria (Germany) who were not occupationally
   exposed to phthalates. Phthalate metabolites, secondary and primary
   ones, were detected in all specimens. Concentrations were found to vary
   strongly from phthalate to phthalate and subject to subject with
   differences spanning more than three orders of magnitude. Median
   concentrations for excretion of DEHP metabolites were 46.8 mug/L for
   5OH-MEHP (range 0.5-818 mug/L), 36.5 mug/L for 5oxo-MEHP (range 0.5-544
   mug/L), and 10.3 mug/L for MEHP (range:<0.5 (limit of quantification,
   LOQ) to 177 mug/L). A strong correlation was found between the excretion
   of 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.991,
   indicating close metabolic proximity of those two parameters but also
   the absence of any contaminating interference. Median concentrations for
   the other monoester metabolites were for mono-n-butylphthalate (MnBuP)
   181 mug/L, for monobenzylphthalate (MBzP) 21.0 mug/L, for
   monoethylphthalate, (MEP) 90.2 mug/L and for mono-n-octylphthalate (MOP)
   < 1.0 mug/L (LOQ). These results will help to perform health risk
   assessments for the phthalate exposure of the general population. (C)

Abstract = {{A two-compartment one-toxin model was fitted to data of the toxin level
   of Pacific oysters contaminated by Alexandrium tamarense in Hiroshima
   Bay, Japan. The model contained state variables for the viscera and
   non-viscera components of the oyster and was run using data for A.
   tamarense cell numbers with and without water temperature. It was tuned
   against toxicity data collected for the oyster. The fit of the predicted
   oyster toxicity to real data was best when there was no temperature link
   to cellular toxicity. Risk-assessment analysis suggests that the present
   model provides a robust indicator of the toxic status of the Pacific
   oyster in Hiroshima Bay. The model prediction of the toxin levels with
   routine monitoring of the toxic phytoplankton cell number could
   complement the monitoring of the toxin levels in shellfish by currently
   used time-consuming bioassays.}},

Abstract = {{Byeatch studies have largely ignored population level effects on fish
   species of little commercial interest. Here we analyze bycatch of the
   lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) in the bait-shrimp trawl fishery in
   Hernando Beach, Florida, providing the first fisheries data for this
   species. Based on catch per unit of effort (CPUE), size, sex, and
   reproductive status of trawled H. erectus, 1) approximately 72,000
   seahorses were caught annually by this fleet, from a population of
   unknown size, 2) trawling affected population cohorts differentially
   because of temporal and spatial variation in CPUE and population size,
   and 3) a greater proportion of females than males was removed in
   trawling. Our findings suggest that trawling may affect seahorse
   populations through direct mortality, social disruption, and habitat
   damage. However, the lack of specific abundance or catchability
   estimates for H. erectus means that the precise impact of trawling on
   this fish remains uncertain. This paper focuses attention on the need
   for research and monitoring of small fishes that are caught incidentally
   in nonselective gear.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly believed that Nantucket pine tip moth (Rhyacionia
   frustrana {[}Comstock]) feeding damage on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.)
   increases in relation to the intensity of silvicultural practices. Some
   studies have produced contrary or inconclusive data regarding this
   issue. This study was designed to examine the relationships between tree
   growth rates and tip moth development by enhancing growth with nitrogen
   (N) fertilizer and herbicide applications. The four treatments were N
   fertilizer, herbicide, herbicide+fertilizer, and untreated control.
   These treatments were monitored for tip moth damage levels, tip moth
   pupal numbers per pine shoot, insect population dynamics, and tree
   growth. Pine growth was significantly greater in the herbicide
   treatments than in the other treatments. There was a significant
   increase in diameter related to the fertilizer treatments, but no
   differences in tree height or volume were detected. Pupal weight was
   significantly lower in the herbicide treatment in the second year. Tip
   moth population fluctuations were greater in the herbicide treated plots
   than in the untreated control, and there were significant linear
   relationships between these fluctuations in the treatments versus
   percent parasitism, pupal weight, and diameter growth. This study shows
   that tip moth populations are not necessarily increased or decreased by
   intensive management practices, but can be less stable due to these
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{1. Total species richness for an assemblage or site is a valuable
   measure in conservation monitoring and assessment, but protocols for
   sampling and species richness determination in wetland habitats such as
   ponds, bogs or mires remain largely unrefined.
   2. Techniques for estimation of total richness of an assemblage based
   upon replicated sampling offer the opportunity to derive useful
   estimates of total richness based upon small numbers of samples, and
   limit sampling- derived disturbance which can be particularly
   problematic in small aquatic habitats.
   3. We quantified the performance of eight of the most commonly
   encountered estimators of species richness for a variety of littoral
   zone macrofauna from ponds, comparing estimated richness to maximum
   richness derived from sampling.
   4. Estimates using non-parametric techniques based on species incidence
   provided the most accurate and precise estimates. The estimators Chao 2
   and incidence-based coverage estimator ( ICE) from this category were
   reliable and consistent slight over-estimators; the abundance- based
   estimator Chao1 also performed well.
   5. Species inventory based on relatively small numbers of samples might
   be significantly improved by use of non-parametric estimators for
   quantification of species richness.
   6. Use of non-parametric estimators of species richness can assist
   biodiversity inventory by preventing erroneous rankings of habitat
   richness based upon observed species numbers from limited sampling.}},

Title = {{Effects of climatic change on the phenology of butterflies in the

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Phenological changes in response to climatic warming have been detected
   across a wide range of organisms. Butterflies stand out as one of the
   most popular groups of indicators of climatic change, given that,
   firstly, they are poikilothermic and, secondly, have been the subject of
   thorough monitoring programmes in several countries for a number of
   decades. Here we provide for the first time strong evidence of
   phenological change as a consequence of recent climatic warming in
   butterflies at a Spanish site in the northwest Mediterranean Basin. By
   means of the widely used Butterfly Monitoring Scheme methodology, three
   different phenological parameters were analysed for the most common
   species to test for trends over time and relationships with temperature
   and precipitation. Between 1988 and 2002, there was a tendency for
   earlier first appearance dates in all 17 butterfly species tested, and
   significant advances in mean flight dates in 8 out of 19 species. On the
   other hand, the shape of the curve of adult emergence did not show any
   regular pattern. These changes paralleled an increase of 1 - 1.5
   degreesC in mean February, March and June temperatures. Likewise, a
   correlation analysis indicated the strong negative effect of spring
   temperature on phenological parameters (i.e. higher temperatures tended
   to produce phenological advances), and the opposite effect of
   precipitation in certain months. In addition, there was some evidence to
   indicate that phenological responses may differ between taxonomic
   lineages or species with similar diets. We discuss the consequences that
   these changes may have on species' population abundances, especially
   given the expected increase in aridity in the Mediterranean Basin caused
   by current climatic warming. We predict that varying degrees of
   phenological flexibility may account for differences in species'
   responses and, for multivoltine species, predict strong selection
   favouring local seasonal adaptations such as diapause phenomena or
   migratory behaviour.}},

   bio-indicators. Over a period of 6 years, parasites from 30 different
   taxa were identified, but only 7 taxa of the parasite community occurred
   regularly at all locations and in sufficient abundance that they could
   be considered as potential indicator species. These species were the
   ciliophoran Trichodina spp., the copepods Acanthochondria cornuta,
   Lepeophtheirus pectoralis and Lernaeocera branchialis, the helminths
   Zoogonoides viviparus and Cucullanus heterochrous and metacercaria of an
   unidentified digenean species. Infection characteristics of these
   parasites are presented, with a comparison of the results from
   individual sampling periods and those of the long-term data set. Natural
   influences on the infection levels, such as temporal variations, habitat
   conditions and host-related factors, were evaluated. All of these
   parasite species showed significant differences in their infection
   levels between the Elbe estuary, as the most polluted site, and the less
   polluted coastal and marine locations: Helgoland, Outer Eider estuary
   and Spiekeroog, especially in the long-term data set. Gradual
   differences between the Elbe, the Outer Eider and Helgoland, which were
   not detected in individual sampling periods, also became evident in the
   pooled-data set. These were found in the prevalence of Trichodina spp.,
   A. cornuta, Z viviparus and C. heterochrous. Although salinity is
   considered as the most important natural factor, influencing the
   distribution pattern of the majority of the potential indicator species,
   infection levels of most of these species differed between locations
   with similar salinity conditions. Infection levels corresponded to a
   contamination gradient (Elbe > Inner Eider, Outer Eider > Helgoland)
   established across the locations. Seasonal variation in the infection
   parameters affected the spatial distribution of the copepod species
   Lepeophtheirus pectoralis and Lernaeocera branchialis. Annual variations
   are considered to occur in the range of natural variability, so no trend
   of increasing or decreasing infection levels of the parasites was found
   during the course of the study. This study underlined the idea that an
   analysis of fish-parasite fauna is very useful in ecosystem monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a statistical analysis of ecological data collected in the
   MARS project from marine environments of the Red and Mediterranean Seas
   in Israel, and the North Sea in Germany. In the study of fish parasite
   data, we examine the basic premise that the complex host lifecycles of
   heteroxenous (h) parasites make them more sensitive to pollution than
   monoxenous (m) parasites which have only one host. Unlike results from
   analyses of earlier survey data, we find that the pooled h/m index for a
   community is not a clear indicator of environmental stress as originally
   hypothesized. This is due to the relatively large seasonal variability
   at the sampling sites over the course of the 3-year survey. Other
   possible indicators for water pollution gradients are checked, including
   species richness, diversity and prevalence of parasite populations. A
   theoretical model of host-parasite population dynamics that makes the
   presence of ecological thresholds transparent is offered to help explain
   the abrupt transitions prominent in the distributions of parasites at
   different sites under different pollution loadings. Heavy metal and
   chlorinated hydrocarbon data collected from fish tissue samples and
   molluscs of the three seas are assessed as bioindicators for pollution
   monitoring. The xenobiotic loads and indices of defence system activity
   and tissue damage are shown to have great potential as monitoring
   bioindicators.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for assessing risk to wildlife from exposure to environmental
   contaminants remain highly uncertain as empirical data required for
   accurate estimates of exposure or determination of toxicity thresholds
   are lacking. Some practitioners have advocated an ecological approach
   (i.e., ``top down{''}) to wildlife assessments to account directly for
   the uncertainties inherent in aggregating direct toxicological effects
   to individuals when estimating population risk (i.e., ``bottom up{''}
   techniques). This paper suggests a methodology for conducting wildlife
   risk assessments that incorporates both the ``bottom up{''} and ``top
   down{''} techniques by taking into account multiple lines of evidence
   that are gathered by proceeding through a tiered approach including: 1)
   concentration of chemicals in relation to levels reported to be harmful;
   2) bioassays or toxicity studies to define dose-response relationships;
   and 3) field studies of population or community responses. A step wise
   process progressing through these three tiers is a cost-effective method
   for developing the necessary information. This method is analogous to
   standard epidemiological approaches. Incorporation of continued
   monitoring and directed field studies into risk management is suggested
   as a means to move forward with environmental management decisions in
   the face of the significant uncertainties that will continue to be
   associated with wildlife risk assessments.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of weather on the population dynamics of Oebalus poecilus,
   the principal insect pest of rice in South and Central America, is
   examined. Light trapping was used for one year, but was soon discarded
   in favour of the more reliable sweep netting which was utilised to
   monitor populations in fields and non-cropped habitats from autumn 1999
   to spring 2002. The results indicate that O. poecilus feeds on
   alternative host grasses on levees surrounding the rice fields. Adult
   bugs move into the fields in mid-January and mid-August of each year. In
   fields there are typically four generations per season, which are
   approximately four weeks apart. Adults move off the crop in April and
   October. Data presented here indicate that rainfall is critical to the
   `off-season' survival of O. poecilus, and high rainfall during April to
   July and November to January causes increases in O. poecilus
   populations. This is particularly important given the recent extreme
   perturbations in the normal bimodal rainfall patterns caused by El Nino
   and La Nina events. The ability to predict the severity of O. poecilus
   populations from weekly rainfall data will provide a significant input
   into the development of IPM programme for O. poecilus.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of several early-season insecticides on genetically
   modified, herbicide-tolerant Roundup Ready(R) cotton was evaluated
   during 1999 and 2000 by monitoring densities of larval and adult thrips
   (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) populations and selected plant growth
   characteristics. Thrips densities and plant growth characteristics were
   not affected by glyphosate or conventional herbicides. In 1999,
   conventional herbicides caused a delay in crop maturity by producing
   higher nodes of first position fruiting square. Densities of larval and
   adult thrips were lower in aldicarb-treated plots compared with other
   treatments, and insecticide treatments protected plants from thrips
   feeding. Thrips species composition was also determined for each year of
   the study. Frankliniella fusca (Hinds) was the most abundant species
   detected both years. Insecticide-treated plants had more leaf area than
   untreated plants. During both years, phorate-treated plants had
   significantly fewer (Pless than or equal to0.05) flowers than other
   insecticide-treated or untreated plants. Lint yields in 1999 were not
   affected by insecticide treatment. However, in 2000, six of the
   treatments did not differ in the first harvest yield produced and only
   aldicarb-treated plots had significantly higher first harvest yields
   than either phorate-treated or untreated plots. Only plots treated with
   aldicarb produced significantly higher total lint yields than untreated
   plots.}},

Abstract = {{1. The hunting of wild animals for consumption by people currently
   threatens many species with extinction. In the tropics, where the threat
   is most acute, hunting frequently targets many prey species
   simultaneously, yet our understanding of the dynamics of hunting in such
   multi-prey systems is limited. This study addressed this issue by
   modelling the effects of human hunters on prey population dynamics in a
   multi-species prey community. Both pursuit hunting (in which offtake
   depends partly on hunters' prey preferences) and trap hunting (in which
   the offtake is determined solely by random processes) were considered as
   submodels.
   2. The pursuit hunting submodel was validated against studies of
   subsistence hunting in tropical forests, while the trap hunting submodel
   was validated against data from five studies of offtake rates by snare
   hunters in subSaharan Africa. In all cases, observed prey removal rates
   were predicted well by the model.
   3. Simulations demonstrated the emergence of distinctive prey profiles
   at different intensities of hunting, related to sequences of
   overexploitation dependent on species' vulnerabilities to exploitation.
   4. Synthesis and applications. A model is developed to explore the
   impacts of harvesting on multi-species prey communities. Model
   predictions can be used to aid the interpretation of incomplete
   monitoring data, such as snapshots of the species taken by hunters. This
   will improve our ability to assess the sustainability of multi-species
   hunting systems using the limited information typically available in
   these cases.}},

Abstract = {{1 Established individuals removed at random from populations of 11
   long-lived herbaceous species coexisting in a local area of ancient
   limestone pasture at Cress-brookdale in North Derbyshire were subjected
   to clonal propagation to produce stocks of genetically identical
   individuals sufficient to create 36 model communities identical in
   species composition but widely contrasted in genetic diversity.
   2 Three levels of genetic diversity were imposed. In one treatment, all
   individuals of each species were genetically unique. The second
   contained four randomly selected genotypes of each species. In the
   third, there was no genetic diversity in any of the species but each
   community contained a unique combination of genotypes.
   3 Over a period of 5 years the communities were allowed to develop in
   microcosms containing natural rendzina soil and exposed to a
   standardized regime of simulated grazing and trampling. The treatments
   were maintained by the removal of flowers, immature seed-heads and
   seedlings originating from the seed-bank and seed rain. Point quadrat
   surveys were used to monitor changes in species composition and
   diversity in the three experimental treatments.
   4 During the experiment a distinction rapidly developed between five
   canopy dominants and five subordinates, a process that caused the
   vegetation structure to closely resemble that occurring at
   Cressbrookdale.
   5 A gradual loss of species diversity occurred in all three treatments
   but by the end of the fifth growing season species diversity was higher
   in the most genetically diverse communities.
   6 Ordination of the 36 communities at intervals over a 5-year period
   revealed a gradual convergence in the species composition of the
   4-genotype and 16-genotype communities and this effect was more strongly
   developed in the latter. A comparable process was not observed in the
   1-genotype communities, suggesting that interaction between particular
   genotypes of different species in local neighbourhoods may be an
   essential part of the mechanism that determines the predictable
   composition of a mature pasture community.
   7 It is concluded that, under the conditions of this experiment, genetic
   diversity within component species reduced the rate at which species
   diversity declined. The relative importance in this effect of factors
   such as greater disease resistance and moderated competitive
   interactions remains uncertain.}},

Title = {{Tree species differentiation in growth, recruitment and allometry in
   relation to maximum height in a Bornean mixed dipterocarp forest}},

Abstract = {{1 Maximum attainable height varies greatly between tree species in
   tropical rain forests and covaries with demographic and allometric
   traits. We examined these relationships in 27 abundant tree species in a
   mixed dipterocarp forest. These species were monitored over 3 years in
   two 1-ha plots in western Borneo. A 95-percentile upper height limit was
   used to represent maximum height, to avoid sample size differences among
   populations.
   2 Average growth rate in trunk diameter was regressed against trunk
   diameter using a maximum likelihood model and assuming that growth rates
   were exponentially distributed around the average. Estimated average
   growth rate at small trunk diameters ( up to 11 cm) was independent of
   maximum height among the 27 species, while the degree of growth
   reduction at larger diameters was larger for species with smaller
   maximum height.
   3 The recruitment rate efficiency of saplings was negatively correlated
   with maximum height, regardless of the measure used to assess species
   abundance. In particular, sapling recruitment per unit basal area
   declined greatly with increasing maximum height, consistent with model
   predictions of the traits required for the stable coexistence of species
   at different heights within the canopy.
   4 Allometric analyses showed that understorey species had shorter
   heights at the same trunk diameter, and deeper crowns at the same tree
   height, than canopy species. Therefore, understorey species showed
   adaptive morphology to deep shade.
   5 The regressed size-dependent pattern of average growth rate and an
   assumption that the population was in a steady state readily explained
   the observed trunk diameter distributions for 21 species among 27
   examined. These species, for which the projected size distribution
   hardly changed when the natural increase or decrease of the population
   was set at gamma = +/- 0.005 year(-1), had mortality rates of more than
   four times the value of gamma.}},

Abstract = {{Crop monitoring for adult corn rootworms, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera
   LeConte and Diabrotica barberi Smith and Lawrence, remains the best
   means to assess fields at risk from this pest if replanted to corn, Zea
   mays (L.). Improvements in sampling methodology, including the
   development of a sequential sampling plan, have reduced the minimum
   sampling time required to make a management decision to 20 min or less
   per field per visit. However, many growers and crop consultants still
   find this time commitment a constraint to repeated scouting. A common
   currently used sampling method involves systematically covering most of
   the field following a ``W{''} pattern. The feasibility of replacing the
   current sampling pattern with a simpler and less time-consuming transect
   (straight line) pattern was assessed. When sampling methods were
   compared, computer simulations demonstrated that treatment decisions
   based on transect sampling would have an acceptably low error rate
   averaging 10\% over a range of realistic corn rootworm densities (0-2
   adults per plant). This error rate represented a decrease in accuracy of
   <1\% compared with systematic sampling. Field trials using transect,
   systematic, and random sampling in each field were used to compare the
   categorization of adult corn rootworm densities into ``above{''} or
   ``below{''} threshold with a sequential sampling plan. Efficiency
   measured in time to reach a decision, number of corn plants evaluated,
   and time divided by plants observed were compared between sampling
   methods. The three methods did not differ significantly in the number of
   plants evaluated or in the categorization of corn rootworm populations.
   Transect sampling resulted in a significantly shorter time divided by
   plants observed (38 s), than either systematic (78 s), or random
   sampling methods (166 s). Based on these results transect sampling
   reduces sampling time 51\% compared with systematic sampling and thus
   could be used to reduce total sampling times substantially.}},

Abstract = {{Beginning in 1992, the Slow The Spread (STS) pilot project was initiated
   to target gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) spread rate reduction by
   controlling populations in the transition zone. The project uses
   intensive monitoring techniques, with pheromone-baited sticky moth
   traps, to detect low-level populations and target them for eradication.
   The primary objective of the pilot project was to evaluate the
   feasibility of using integrated pest management techniques to slow the
   spread of gypsy moths over a large geographical area. In this study, the
   cost of STS pilot project activities in 1993-1995 was investigated. A
   cost accounting system was developed and used as a framework to collect
   the cost data and to investigate cost patterns and characteristics.
   Total expenditures of STS activities for 1993-1995 were \$7,685.2
   million. Per unit cost was \$49.67 per trap with the direct cost
   component being \$35.03 per trap. Trapper labor and vehicle expense
   accounted for approximate to90\% of this direct cost. Per unit cost for
   treatment activities was found to average \$27.86 per treated acre. In
   general, the STS pilot project is labor intensive, specifically the
   trapping component. From 1993-1995, 59\% of total project expenditures
   were spent on trapping activities, 28\% on pesticide treatments, and
   13\% on data management. A trapper productivity rate regression model is
   described.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge about the impact of human activity on the behavior of wolves
   (Cams lupus) is important to predict habitats suitable for wolf
   recolonization and for planning management zones. We tested the
   hypothesis that wolves live spatiotemporally segregated from humans.
   From 1994 to 1999, we radiotracked 11 wolves in 4 packs and monitored
   human activity in the Bialowieza Forest, Poland. Wolves avoided
   permanent human-made structures (settlements, forest. edge to arable
   land, roads, tourist trails) more in the day than at night. Wolf
   avoidance increased with increasing human use. Particularly large
   settlements and intensively used public roads reduced the area used by
   wolves. Wolves avoided human presence in the forest (traffic, forestry
   operations) by temporarily selecting areas where people were absent. One
   of the wolf packs selected a national park zone with restriced access
   (50 km(2)) as the core area of its home range in both day and night.
   Conversely, wolf packs living in a commercial forest with small nature
   reserves (less than or equal to4 km(2)) did not select. reserves in the
   day or night. We concluded that spatiotemporal segregation is an
   adaptation of wolves to coexist with humans while keeping their activity
   pattern optimized toward food acquisition. The distribution of areas
   with restricted human access, forest, settlements, and intensively used
   public roads are important factors determining the suitability of an
   area for wolves.}},

Abstract = {{Although extreme weather events-such as hurricanes-cause obvious changes
   in landscape and tree cover, the impact of such events on population
   dynamics of ungulates has not yet been measured accurately. We report a
   first quantification of the demographic consequences on roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) of the strongest hurricane (Lothar) that France
   has suffered in centuries. Based on long-term monitoring (>20 yr) of
   known-age individuals in 2 populations, We found that Lothar had no
   detectable negative effect on age-and sex-specific survival rates,
   except perhaps for old females. Likewise, although Lothar occurred
   during the time in the roe deer reproductive cycle when embryos are
   implanted, we found no evidence of a decrease in either the pregnancy
   rate or litter size. Our results show that roe deer populations are
   resistant to this kind of extreme weather event. The consequences for
   wildlife management are direct and important: (1) the hunting bag was
   low in 2000 due to restricted hunter access, and (2) the main effect of
   hurricane Lothar was to create openings within large forests that are
   good habitat for roe deer. We suggest that Lothar will paradoxally have
   a positive effect on roe deer population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The Indian house crow (Corvus splendens) has successfully invaded
   tropical and subtropical regions well beyond its native range, reaching
   pest proportions in many areas. The invasive population of house crows
   in Singapore (Southeast Asia) has increased at least 30-fold since 1985
   and now numbers in excess of 130,000 birds. To understand the population
   ecology and behavior of the house crow in Singapore, we undertook
   regular population size and roost surveys, dissections of birds shot (to
   provide age structure and breeding status), detailed nestsite
   observations, and monitoring of coastal dispersal. Using a
   discrete-time, density-dependent population model to synthesize this
   information, we demonstrated that at least 41,000 crows will need to be
   culled in the first year of a control program, and equivalent effort
   committed each year thereafter, to be confident of suppressing the
   Singapore population from its 2001 density of 190 birds/km(2) to the
   management target of <10 birds/km(2) within a 10-year period. This
   figure drops to 32,000 if culling is combined with other management
   strategies such as resource limitation and nest destruction. Complete
   eradication of the house crow from Singapore may be an unrealistic goal
   due to potential difficulties in detecting crows at IOW population
   densities and influx of migrants from neighboring Malaysia. Our study
   has implications for pest-bird management in other cities in Asia,
   Africa, and the Middle East, and presents it surrogate
   population-dynamics management tool for use in regions where the house
   crow has become established as a pest species, but where limited local
   field data is available.}},

Abstract = {{The potentially important ecology of subterranean predators of soil
   ecosystem engineers is poorly understood. This is especially true of
   caecilian amphibians (Gymnophiona) for which there are virtually no
   quantitative data. Results of the first field trials of permanent
   marking in caecilians are presented. A preliminary assessment is made of
   the efficacy of mark-recapture studies for estimating population size of
   Gegeneophis ramaswamii Taylor in 100 m(2) of low intensity agriculture
   in Kerala, India. Over three sampling occasions spanning 58 days of the
   monsoon season, 114 individuals were captured, 104 marked and released,
   and 21 recaptured. Models estimate an open population of 60 individuals
   (95\% confidence interval of 45.2 to 151.3), and a closed population of
   236 (95\% confidence interval of 174 to 351). A census interpretation of
   the raw capture data gives densities of about 0.31 to 0.48 m(-2).
   Results suggest large movement in and out of the sampled area during the
   study. Despite caveats associated with these data, progress is made in
   identifying potential limitations and improvements in the methods used.
   This study highlights the paucity of knowledge of caecilian ecology, and
   the need for long-term studies to elucidate further ecological
   information and to monitor populations.}},

Abstract = {{Larval behaviors are increasingly recognized as determining factors in
   the water column distribution and subsequent settlement patterns of
   marine invertebrates. In particular, larvae within one or two body
   lengths of the seafloor (= interaction zone) may be better able to
   control their settlement location or respond to settlement cues. Here we
   examine temporal changes the behavior of larval oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica) swimming in the bottom 1 cm of a flume boundary layer. In
   addition, we present a novel behavior, called `dive-bombing', that
   consists of an abrupt downward acceleration and subsequent contact with
   the bottom. Larvae were divided into two arbitrarily chosen size classes
   (those retained on a 153 mum screen and those retained on a 202 mum
   screen) to separate those that developed eyespots from those that did
   not develop eyespots. Behavior in a flume boundary layer was monitored
   from day 15 to day 21 post-fertilization. In the larger size class, the
   percentage of oyster larvae within close proximity (1 to 2 body lengths)
   of the flume bed steadily increased from 6\% to 28\% with larval age. In
   contrast, if larvae were restricted from reaching larger sizes through
   sieving this proportion remained constant at 12\%. Dive-bombing was
   exhibited by a constant 4\% of the larval population regardless of age
   or size. Kinematic analysis of swimming paths shows dive-bombing to be
   distinct from other swimming behaviors and from the passive sinking of
   dead larvae. For example, vertical acceleration at the initiation of
   dive-bombing is some 30-400 times that measured for other live or dead
   larvae. Our results indicate that larvae are capable of rapid
   acceleration and that they may be able to control their approach to the
   bottom under a much wider range of conditions than had previously been
   suspected.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the impacts of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus
   Zimmerman) on the herbaceous vegetation at Beall Woods Nature Preserve
   in southern Illinois, USA, from 1999 to 2001 using 30 1-m(2) exclosures
   and 60 1-m(2) open plots. A deer removal program was implemented
   following the first year of the study, giving us the opportunity to
   compare the impact of grazing between years of high and low deer
   densities. Weekly monitoring was conducted from February through June
   each year to assess species richness, abundance, number and heights of
   grazed plants, and the number of individuals flowering and producing
   seed in each plot. Species that were heavily grazed before the deer
   population was reduced included Jacob's ladder (Polemonium reptans L.),
   goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis L.), red trillium (Trillium recurvatum
   Beck), false Solomon's seal (Smilacina racemosa {[}L.] Desf.), and dwarf
   larkspur (Delphinium tricorne Michx.). After the herd was reduced,
   grazing decreased on most species but some such as dwarf larkspur
   continued to be used heavily. Wildflowers such as Jack-in-the-pulpit
   (Arisaema triphyllum {[}L.] Schott) and toothwort (Dentaria laciniata
   Muhl.) were lightly impacted throughout the study. Plants protected by
   exclosures were more likely to flower. The percentage of red trillium
   that flowered increased from 1\% to 18\%, and dwarf larkspur flowering
   increased from 58\% to 93\% after 3 y of protection. Similarly, the
   average height of protected trillium rose from 12.7 to 17.6 cm, and
   larkspur height increased from 12.4 to 33.8 cm. Trillium plants that
   were grazed repeatedly had smaller rhizomes and growth rings than
   ungrazed plants. The mean height and percentage of individuals flowering
   in species such as red trillium, false Solomon's seal, dwarf larkspur,
   and Jacob's ladder appear to be useful indicators for assessing the
   impact of deer on herbaceous vegetation in midwestern U.S. forests.}},

Abstract = {{Festuca idahoensis (Idaho fescue) is a perennial caespitose grass,
   common in semi-arid rangelands of the Intermountain West. To determine
   how individuals are recruited into a population, we studied two
   long-term monitoring plots that were established in 1937 at the Northern
   Great Basin Experimental Range in southeastern Oregon. The plots
   measured 3.05x3.05 m, and were located approximately 30 m apart. One
   plot was ungrazed, the other was subject to moderate levels of cattle
   grazing. The number of F. idahoensis plants in both plots increased
   ten-fold between 1937 and 1996, but whether this was due primarily to
   reproduction by seed or clonal fragmentation was unknown. In 1996, we
   mapped and sampled 160 plants of F. idahoensis. We used dominant
   inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers and codominant allozyme
   markers in order to identify genetic individuals and measure genetic
   diversity. Both plots were characterized by high levels of genetic and
   clonal diversity. When information from ISSRs, allozymes and sample
   location were combined, 126 genets were recognized, each consisting of
   one to four samples (ramets). By measuring the diameter of clones
   surrounding plants that were present in 1937, we estimated that clonal
   spread occurred at a rate of approximately 3.7 cm per decade, and thus
   was of secondary importance in the maintenance and increase of F.
   idahoensis stands. Sexual reproduction, rather than clonal
   fragmentation, accounted for most of the recruitment of new plants into
   these plots. The grazed plot had fewer ramets, genotypes, and clones
   than the ungrazed plot, but the ramets were significantly larger. Levels
   of genetic diversity did not differ in the grazed and ungrazed plots,
   but there was some evidence for a small, but significant level of
   genetic differentiation between the two. The results also indicate that
   F. idahoensis has the potential to be a long-lived species with some
   individuals persisting in excess of 60 years. This study demonstrates
   how long-term monitoring can be supplemented by genetic analysis to
   obtain detailed information on the population dynamics of plants. In the
   case of this community dominant species, this provides essential
   information for understanding succession and developing management and
   restoration strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) damage to winter cereals and population
   dynamics of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi during fall were monitored in
   fields during 10 years at various locations in the northern half of
   France. Logistic regression was used to examine whether a simple risk
   probability algorithm based only on the autumnal population dynamic.,,
   of R. padi can accurately predict yield losses caused by BYDV and,
   therefore, the need for insecticide treatment. Results showed that the
   area under the curve of the percentage of plants infested by R. padi
   during autumn was highly significantly related to BYDV yield losses.
   Then, a cost/benefit analysis was performed to estimate the optimal
   decision threshold resulting in the lowest annual average costs of BYDV
   damage and control. A ``model use{''} strategy allowed a reduction in
   the annual average costs of BYDV disease and control of up to 36\% when
   compared with a ``prophylactic spraying{''} strategy. The optimal
   decision threshold was highly sensitive to variation in disease
   prevalence. This property was used to propose an easy way to adapt the
   model to any production situation through the determination of the most
   accurate decision threshold.}},

Abstract = {{The agronomic impact of genetically tagged azospirilla ( Azospirillum
   brasilense) was assessed in open field and their fluctuation were
   monitored in the soil/rhizosphere. Strain performance, upon inoculation
   of sorghum, was evaluated over a two-years period; agronomic treatments
   included nitrogen application (0, 80, 160 kg ha(-1)), and types of
   inoculant (Sp245 lacZ, Sp6 gusA, Sp6 IAA++ gusA). Grain yield was higher
   for inoculated seed plots than in non-inoculated ones, whereas nitrogen
   content, biomass of plant residues and nitrogen in plant residues gave
   values that were not statistically different. Root length density (RLD)
   of sorghum at the end of the stem elongation stage was affected only by
   the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) overproducer Azospirillum strain ( A.
   brasilense Sp6 IAA++ gusA) with respect to the normal IAA producer ( A.
   brasilense Sp6 gusA), being higher in the first 40 cm of depth,
   notwithstanding the level of nitrogen fertilization. The traceability of
   the released genetically modified strains enabled to monitor their
   ability to colonise soil and roots. Moreover, the genetic modification
   per se vs. the non-modified counterpart, did not affect the culturable
   aerobic population in soil, microfungi, streptomycetes, fluorescent
   pseudomonads, soil microbial biomass, or some microbial activities, all
   selected as important indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Three nurseries produced apple rootstocks (M9) and budwood (cv. Royal
   Gala), which they exchanged at the end of the first year. Each nursery
   then budded its own budwood onto the rootstocks it had produced and that
   from the other two nurseries. Budded trees were grown on for a further
   year before being planted at HRI, East Malling in southern England;
   NIHPBS, Loughgall in Northern Ireland; and ADAS, Rosemaund in the West
   Midlands of England. Canker development was monitored twice a year. The
   position of the infected trees within the orchard was recorded, as was
   the position of the canker on each tree (main-stem or peripheral).
   Nectria galligena was isolated from representative cankers and analysed
   using molecular techniques. At the sites in Northern Ireland and HRI
   there was a strong positional effect, especially of peripheral cankers,
   indicating that most of the inoculum was external and had been spread
   from neighbouring orchards. There was little or no positional effect on
   main-stem cankers at any of the three sites. The proportions of
   different isolates taken from peripheral cankers was different in
   Northern Ireland from that in England, suggesting different populations
   associated with the geographic areas. In contrast, the populations of N.
   galligena obtained from main-stem cankers were very similar in England
   and Northern Ireland. It was concluded that a small proportion of trees
   developing canker were infected during propagation, with no symptom
   development until after planting. In a second trial it was demonstrated
   that trees infected during the propagation phase, and particularly at
   budding and heading back, could develop canker up to 3 years later.
   While it is clear that some canker developing in the orchard can be
   associated with the nursery of production, in climatic conditions
   conducive to the formation and dissemination of conidia, inoculum from
   surrounding infected orchards is the primary source of the pathogen.
   Aerial spread is therefore an essential element of the epidemiology of
   N. galligena, and its control is a crucial part of any canker-control
   programme.}},

Abstract = {{Stream water concentrations of the faecal coliform group of sanitary
   indicator bacteria were monitored in the Newmills Burn, a small
   agriculturally intensive tributary of the River Don in Aberdeenshire.
   The results indicated that during its passage through the catchment,
   stream water became significantly contaminated with faecal coliform
   bacteria from the main agricultural land use inputs of livestock grazing
   and organic waste applications. Point sources of faecal coliform
   bacteria in terms of farmyard runoff, however, also appeared to be
   important in contributing to the spatial pattern of contamination.
   Significant temporal variation was observed in response to the
   hydrological behaviour of the catchment. Higher flows and more frequent
   washout of stored bacteria in winter and spring months led to lower
   faecal coliform concentrations than were detected during the summer.
   Maximum faecal coliform concentrations were measured during rainfall
   events and the varying responses associated with these helped to
   identify the importance of different sources of bacteria in the
   catchment and the mechanisms transferring them. The overall impact on
   the water quality of the Newmills Burn was considered as having a
   potentially serious threat to the health of downstream recreational
   users of the River Don, as well as to the large proportion of the local
   population who rely on private water supplies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Captive breeding of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) has had limited success
   because a high percentage of captive females exhibit a lack of ovarian
   activity. This study examined concentrations of ovarian and adrenal
   hormones in wild-caught cheetahs (n = 3) housed in large outdoor
   enclosures on private game ranches in Namibia. Cheetahs were monitored
   for a 16-month period to investigate the effect of season on ovarian and
   adrenal function. Secretory profiles of oestradiol, progestagen, and
   cortisol metabolites were quantified non-invasively using faecal steroid
   analysis. All three cheetahs exhibited ovarian activity; however, none
   cycled continuously. Periods of anoestrus occurred during overlapping
   periods between August and December 1994, but not during the same time
   period in 1995. Mean duration of the oestrous cycle, oestrus period and
   baseline concentrations of reproductive hormones were consistent with
   those observed in other captive cheetah populations. Concentrations of
   faecal corticoids were lower than those from captive cheetahs in North
   America. There was no correlation between adrenal activity and ovarian
   function. Spontaneous ovulation was documented in one cheetah. These
   findings support those of earlier studies that even under natural and,
   therefore, presumably ideal environmental conditions, reproductive
   activity in captive cheetahs is not continuous.}},

Abstract = {{Antelope populations in Coleford Nature Reserve (1272 ha) in the
   southern Drakensberg were monitored on average 5.4 times per annum from
   1986 to 2001. Population sizes of reedbuck (Redunca arundinum), mountain
   reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula), grey rhebuck (Pelea capreolus), and
   oribi (Ourebia ourebi) varied monthly because they utilized adjoining
   properties, but all first increased synchronously between 1986 and 1988
   and then decreased synchronously until 1993. By 2002, oribi were no
   longer resident, while population levels of reedbuck, mountain reedbuck
   and grey rhebuck had stabilized at a lower level although the latter two
   were considered vulnerable to extirpation. The sudden, synchronous
   increase of the four species was attributed to compression of
   populations from adjoining properties as a result of an increase in
   hunting by dogs. Their precipitous, synchronous decline was attributed
   mainly to poaching and a succession of long, dry winters. Population
   recovery after 1993 was probably constrained by a reduction in habitat
   on adjoining properties and, for reedbuck and oribi, by increased
   competition from increasing populations of blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas
   phillipsii) and wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou). Population declines were
   associated with reduced calving success, and in some years failure to
   calve. Healthy reedbuck populations occur on agricultural land in the
   region. However as the reserve is too small for the persistence of
   mountain reedbuck, grey rhebuck, and oribi they appear to depend on the
   maintenance of indigenous grassland through livestock ranching under
   private tenure.}},

Abstract = {{The femoral chordotonal organ (FCO) in orthopteran insects comprises
   several hundred sensory neurons, making it one of the most complex
   insect proprioceptors. The sensory neurons are suspended from the
   proximal femur, connecting distally to ligaments and to a needle-like
   apodeme extending from the proximal tibia. They monitor the position and
   movement of the tibia. To address how this complexity depends on
   evolutionary status and function, the morphology of the FCO neurons in
   the primitive orthopteran Hemideina femorata was investigated by
   staining small populations of identified afferents. As in crickets, the
   FCOs in all legs of the weta comprise partly fused ventral and dorsal
   scoloparia, with the former containing two groups of somata, the ventral
   group (VG) and the dorsal group (DG). However, the dendrites of the DG
   insert into thin connective tissue attached to the ventral side of the
   dorsal ligament, forming a ``third scoloparium.{''} The VG afferents
   terminate mainly in the motor association neuropils, whereas afferents
   from the dorsal scoloparium neurons terminate exclusively in the
   vibratory neuropil as do the afferents from the sub-genual organ, a
   substrate vibration detector. Several afferents originating in the DG
   have extensive terminations in the motor association-, vibratory-, and
   auditory-processing neuropils, indicating lesser functional
   specialization than in the other groups. The evolutionary development of
   the FCO is discussed from a comparative viewpoint. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Concern about gene flow from crops to wild relatives has become
   widespread with the increasing cultivation of transgenic crops. Possible
   consequences of such gene flow include genetic assimilation, wherein
   crop genes replace wild ones, and demographic swamping, wherein hybrids
   are less fertile than their wild parents, and wild populations shrink.
   Using mathematical models of a wild population recurrently receiving
   pollen from a genetically fixed crop, we find that the conditions for
   genetic assimilation are not stringent, and progress towards replacement
   can be fast, even for disfavoured crop genes. Demographic swamping and
   genetic drift relax the conditions for genetic assimilation and speed
   progress towards replacement. Genetic assimilation can involve
   thresholds and hysteresis, such that a small increase in immigration can
   lead to fixation of a disfavoured crop gene that had been maintained at
   a moderate frequency, even if the increase in immigration is cancelled
   before the gene fixes. Demographic swamping can give rise to
   `migrational meltdown', such that a small increase in immigration can
   lead to not only fixation of a disfavoured crop gene but also drastic
   shrinkage of the wild population. These findings suggest that the spread
   of crop genes in wild populations should be monitored more closely.}},

Abstract = {{Canola, Brassica napus L. (Brassicaceae), is a relatively new crop in
   South Africa. Several insect pests, including diamondback moth, Plutella
   xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), that attack cruciferous
   vegetables, also attack canola. The aims of this study were to determine
   the seasonal phenology of R xylostella populations on canola, and the
   composition, relative abundance and seasonal phenology of parasitoids
   attacking R xylostella on this crop. Diamondback moth adults were
   monitored with synthetic sex-pheromone traps. Larval and pupal
   populations of R xylostella were monitored weekly for three years at
   Bapsfontein and Rietondale in Gauteng province. Samples of diamondback
   moth larvae, pupae and parasitoid cocoons were collected and transported
   to the laboratory. Parasitoids that emerged were identified and their
   incidence recorded. Berlese funnel catches were used as an indicator of
   the accuracy of the visual counts. The infestation level of R Xylostella
   larvae was high from May to August at Rietondale, while at Bapsfontein
   it was high from September to December. There was a high correlation (r
   = 0.79, P < 0.001) between pheromone trap catches and subsequent larval
   infestations at Bapsfontein. The pheromone traps indicated that
   diamondback moth adults were present throughout the year. Berlese funnel
   catches indicated that a large number of larvae, especially first
   instars, were overlooked during visual plant scouting. Parasitism rates
   were often very high, reaching 90-100 \%. The following parasitoids were
   recorded from field-collected R xylostella: the larval parasitoids
   Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Apanteles
   halfordi Ullyett (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), the larval/pupal parasitoids
   Diadegma niollipla (Holmgren) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) and Oomyzus
   sokolowskii (Kurdjumov) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), the pupal parasitoid
   Diadromus collaris (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), and the
   hyperparasitoids Mesochorus sp. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) and
   Pteromalus sp. (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). Cotesia plutellae was the
   most abundant parasitoid throughout the study.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological traits of plants often vary considerably in response to
   different environmental conditions, which may render them suitable as
   sensible indicators for conservation purpose.
   To compare the plasticity of morphological traits of species of
   calcareous grassland under different environmental conditions (stands of
   different structure with respect to litter and vegetation height),
   morphometric investigations were carried out on calcareous grasslands
   differing in grazing regime. Populations of the calcareous grassland
   species Plantago media and Scabiosa columbaria subject to different
   grazing regimes showed considerable plasticity.
   There were, e.g. relationships between shoot height, biomass, and
   fertility of individuals. Shoot height and the number of diaspores per
   inflorescence increased significantly with increasing cover of litter.
   Simultaneously there were considerable changes in the reproductive mode,
   from generative only to a combination of generative and vegetative
   reproduction.
   The analysis of morphological plasticity showed that different
   environmental conditions could accurately and easily be monitored
   through the species-specific growth response.
   Especially shoot height appears to play a central role, since the study
   species can vary this growth parameter to escape light deficiency of
   tall stands rich in litter. Due to its large variability, shoot height
   can be used as an indicator of growth conditions of the studied
   populations that are closely linked to land use and conservation
   management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation randomly sampled a fluorochemical manufacturing
   employee population to determine the distribution of serum
   fluorochemical levels according to employees' jobs and work areas.
   Previous analyses of medical surveillance data have not shown
   significant associations between fluorochemical production employees'
   clinical chemistry and hematology tests and their serum PFOS and
   perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, C7F15COO-) concentrations, but may have been
   subject to nonparticipation bias. A random sample of the on-site film
   plant employee population, where fluorochemicals are not produced,
   determined their serum concentrations also. Of the 232 employees
   randomly selected for serum sampling, 186 (80\%) employees participated
   (n=126 chemical plant; n=60 film plant). Sera samples were extracted
   using an ion-pairing extraction procedure and were quantitatively
   analyzed for seven fluorochemicals using high-pressure liquid
   chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry methods. Geometric
   means (in parts per million) and 95\% confidence intervals (in
   parentheses) of the random sample of 126 chemical plant employees were:
   PFOS 0.941 (0.787-1.126); PFOA 0.899 (0.722-1.120);
   perfluorohexanesulfonate 0.180 (0.145-0.223); N-ethyl
   perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate 0.008 (0.006-0.011); N-methyl
   perfluoroctanesulfonamidoacetate 0.081 (0.067-0.098);
   perfluorooctanesulfonamide 0.013 (0.009-0.018); and
   perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate 0.022 (0.018-0.029). These geometric
   means were approximately one order of magnitude higher than those
   observed for the film plant employees.}},

Abstract = {{The Lapwing Vanellus vanellus has experienced population declines and
   contractions in range in the UK over the past three decades. Nest
   monitoring data from the period 1962-99 were analysed to see if the
   decline could be explained by changes in aspects of reproductive
   performance described by clutch size, clutch failure rate and lay date.
   Mean clutch size increased significantly between 1962 and 1999. There
   was no significant trend in lay date. Clutch failure rates were lowest
   in the mid- 1970s, but have increased since. These measures of
   reproductive performance were analysed in relation to four regions:
   arable, pastoral, marginal upland and upland. Marginal upland had the
   lowest overall reproductive performance (low clutch sizes and high
   clutch failure rates) and arable the highest. There were no significant
   differences in reproductive performance between different nesting
   habitats (e.g. crop types, unimproved and rough grazing) at a local
   scale, but grazed grass had higher failure rates and lower clutch sizes
   than ungrazed grass. Failure rates peaked in the early 1980s in marginal
   upland regions. Nest destruction as a cause of nest failure was highest
   during this period. The most common cause of recent nest failure was
   predation. These results suggest that recent changes in population size
   may have been influenced by changes in clutch failure rates. This may
   have been mediated via an increase in grazing intensity in marginal
   uplands and increased predation rates, possibly associated with habitat
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is routinely used to improve grazing in Pyrenean
   rangelands affected by an overall trend of land abandonment. This study
   considers the environmental variables influencing habitat occupancy by
   birds and the consequences of the use of fire in range management for
   bird conservation. Bird use and habitat structure of 11 cover types, the
   result of specific management regimes, were monitored for two breeding
   seasons in a mosaic landscape. Three main gradients of avian
   composition, corresponding to tree cover, shrub volume and grazing
   intensity, were identified from canonical correspondence analysis. The
   structure of the bird community seemed more intensely affected by
   species-specific selection of cover types than by the birds' use of
   multiple patches. Out of a total of 10 bird species analysed by a
   simultaneous confidence intervals procedure, four species with an
   unfavourable conservation status in Europe (Emberiza cia, Lullula
   arborea, Saxicola torquata and Lanius collurio) preferred managed
   grassland. Three types of grassland with shrubs (derived from single or
   repeated burning) had the highest bird conservation index (taking into
   account specific status and abundance of the bird assemblage), whereas
   forests showed middle or low values. The relation (P = 0.054) of this
   index to the logarithm of the pastoral value (which includes density and
   grazing quality of grasses) in currently managed cover types suggests
   that the objectives of grassland recovery by appropriate management
   practices and those of bird conservation coincide in our study area.}},

Abstract = {{Isozyme electrophoresis was used to evaluate levels of genetic diversity
   and population genetic structure of the critically endangered (CR)
   perennial larkspur, Delphinium pentagynum subsp. formenteranum
   (Ranunculaceae), endemic to the island of Formentera (Balearic Islands,
   Spain). There is only one known population for this taxon, containing
   only 480 individuals. Moderate values of diversity were detected (P =
   40.7\%, A = 1.6 and H-e = 0.180), within the range observed in other
   surveyed larkspurs, but higher than most island endemics. Moderate
   levels of inbreeding were detected, probably as a consequence of the
   population's genetic structuring (biparental inbreeding). Threats to
   this taxon are mainly anthropogenic (fires, grazing, pathway works, and
   building pressures), although given that only one population exists,
   stochastic risks cannot be ignored. Conservation of D. pentagynum subsp.
   formenteranum requires in situ strategies, such as implementing a
   monitoring program and establishing a `botanical reserve', and ex situ
   strategies, such as collection and long-term storage of seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Gough Island is a remote Southern Ocean Island that, despite having no
   permanent human population, is under substantial conservation threat as
   a result of human activity. A considerable proportion of the flora and
   fauna has been accidentally introduced, and new data are presented
   showing that ca. 70\% of the free-living pterygote insect species are
   introductions. We describe how endangered seabirds that breed on the
   island may suffer from human fisheries activities and present new
   evidence showing that local temperatures have risen significantly since
   1963, threatening to alter the architecture and composition of species
   communities. These observations are an indication that the terrestrial
   ecosystems of other remote islands in the Southern Oceans may be under
   greater conservation threat than previously thought. In light of the
   threats described, we discuss conservation management priorities for
   Gough Island. To facilitate conservation of the indigenous biota, and
   that of similar islands elsewhere, we suggest that a combination of
   proactive measures designed to maintain the integrity of island
   communities, and monitoring programs designed rapidly to identify new
   conservation threats, should be implemented conscientiously. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria L. (Lythraceae) is an invasive
   wetland perennial plant of Eurasian origin that is widely established in
   North America and is considered a threat to native wetland flora and
   fauna. Two European beetles, Galerucella calmariensis L. and Galerucella
   pusilla Duft. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) have been introduced and
   widely distributed in North America for biological control of Lythrum
   salicaria. Experimental releases of Galerucella spp. beetles were made
   in three locations in Michigan in 1994. In 1997 we initiated a project
   to rear, redistribute, and evaluate the impacts of Galerucella
   calmariensis in 19 additional sites throughout Michigan. G. calmariensis
   became established at 100\% of the 24 release locations monitored in
   these studies and have persisted for up to seven years while G. pusilla
   apparently failed to establish. Large populations of G. calmariensis
   developed from each of the 1994 releases and caused 100\% defoliation of
   L. salicaria. From 1995 to 2000, L. salicaria stem height was reduced
   73-85\%, percent plant cover was reduced 61-95\%, and richness of
   nontarget plant species increased significantly at four out of five
   sites. By 2001, L. salicaria stem height and percent cover were reduced
   38-81\% and 32-74\%, respectively, and nontarget plant species richness
   increased significantly at all five sites in contrast to the situation
   in 1995. Beetles have spread 3-10 km from these original release sites.
   Of the 19 additional sites monitored for 3-5 years post-release, 50\%
   (4/8) of the 1997 releases have developed into large G. calmariensis
   populations and produced severe damage to L. salicaria. Thirty-three
   percent (2/6) of the 1998 releases have generated moderate impacts while
   all 1999 releases (515) remain without clear impacts. The successful
   establishment, spread, and impacts of G. calmariensis indicate the
   critical need for additional research on its role in the restoration of
   desirable plant communities in areas formerly dominated by L. salicaria.

Title = {{Correlates of hornbill distribution and abundance in rainforest

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance patterns of Malabar Grey Hornbill
   Ocyceros griseus and Great Hornbill Buceros bicornis were studied in one
   undisturbed and one heavily altered rainforest landscape in the southern
   Western Ghats, India. The Agasthyamalai hills (Kalakad-Mundanthurai
   Tiger Reserve, KMTR) contained over 400 km(2) of continuous rainforest,
   whereas the Anamalai hills (now Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary, IGWS)
   contained fragments of rainforest in a matrix of tea and coffee
   plantations. A comparison of point-count and line transect census
   techniques for Malabar Grey Hornbill at one site indicated much higher
   density estimates in point-counts (118.4/km(2)) than in line transects
   (51.5/km(2)), probably due to cumulative count over time in the former
   technique. Although line transects appeared more suitable for long-term
   monitoring of hornbill populations, point-counts may be useful for
   large-scale surveys, especially where forests are fragmented and terrain
   is unsuitable for line transects. A standard fixed radius point-count
   method was used to sample different altitude zones (600-1,500 m) in the
   undisturbed site (342 point-counts) and fragments ranging in size from
   0.5 to 2,500 ha in the Anamalais (389 point-counts). In the fragmented
   landscape, Malabar Grey Hornbill was found in higher altitudes than in
   KMTR, extending to nearly all the disturbed fragments at mid-elevations
   (1,000-1,200 m). Great Hornbill persisted in the fragmented landscape
   using all three large fragments (> 200 ha). It was also recorded in four
   of five medium-sized fragments (25-200 ha) and one of five small
   fragments (< 25 ha), which was adjacent to shade coffee plantations.
   Abundance of Malabar Grey Hornbill declined with altitude and increased
   with food-tree species richness. Great Hornbill abundance increased with
   food-tree species richness, suggesting that maintenance of high
   diversity of hornbill food species in fragments is important for their
   persistence. It is likely that the smaller and less specialized Malabar
   Grey Hornbill will survive in disturbed and fragmented forest
   landscapes, while Great Hornbill is more vulnerable to habitat
   alteration. Protection and restoration of rainforest fragments and
   food-tree resources, besides protection of existing large fragments,
   will aid the conservation of hornbills in the region.}},

Abstract = {{The Kilum-Ijim forest is an excellent example of the ornithological
   riches of the Cameroon montane forest biome. The forest is also
   important to over 200,000 people who exert enormous pressure on the
   ecosystem. In 1995, the Kilum-Ijim Forest Project began systematic
   monitoring of birds, with the intention of using them as indicators of
   the overall condition of the forest, as well as monitoring the status of
   individual species. Analyses of data collected in 1999-2000 demonstrated
   some clear differences in habitat use, suggesting suites of bird species
   may be indicators of changes in vegetation. However, beyond this, little
   is known about the response of birds to habitat modifications, or the
   relationship between bird abundance and diversity of other organisms at
   Kilum-Ijim. It is argued that the objective of assessing changes in
   vegetation could be more satisfactorily pursued through direct
   measurement of structural changes in habitats. We highlight the
   necessity for a shift in the programme objectives to place greater
   emphasis on monitoring endemic and threatened bird species for their own
   status and on assessing changes in the bird community as a function of
   changes in the vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Being stationary, seagrass populations respond markedly and cumulatively
   to continued eutrophication over both time and space. Six seagrass
   meadows located within and near the eutrophic Kingston Harbour were
   investigated from October 1995 to June 1996 to determine the effects of
   increased eutrophication on seagrass population dynamics. The stations
   were sited at Fort Augusta, Old Coal Wharf (eutrophic, harbor sites),
   Hellshire coast (mesotrophic) and Port Royal Cays (oligotrophic). Aerial
   productivity, leaf turnover rate, leaf area, shoot density and total
   biomass of Thalassia testudinum were assessed during the period. In
   addition, the water quality at all the sites was monitored, using
   phytoplankton biomass as the primary index of water quality. These data
   were supplemented with water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen
   content, nutrients (nitrates + nitrites and phosphates), and light
   extinction coefficient data at these sites. Although there were no
   significant differences in labile nutrient data at the six sites, the
   significant difference in phytoplankton biomass confirmed previous
   observations of a range of water qualities. Water quality ranged from
   the eutrophic Kingston Harbour (>2.0 mg m(-3) chl a), to mesotrophic
   Hellshire Bays (0.57 +/- 0.02 mg m(-3) chl a), and the oligotrophic Port
   Royal Cays (0.21 +/- 0.01 mg m(-3) chl a). Thalassia testudinum
   populations exhibited an increase in leaf productivity rates (3.64 +/-
   0.39 g dwt m(-2) d(-1) at South East Cay to 5.46 +/- 1.11 g dwt m(-2)
   d(-1) at Old Coal Wharf) and an increase in leaf area (11.64 +/- 1.2
   cm(2) at South East Cay to 22.85 +/- 2.87 cm(2) at Fort Augusta) with
   increasing eutrophication. Conversely, there was a reduction in shoot
   density (917.25 +/- 199.92 m(-2) at South East Cay to 459.62 +/- 65.35
   m(-2) at Old Coal Wharf) and total biomass (972.68 +/- 88.39 g dwt m(-2)
   at Rackhams Cay to 406.24 +/- 62.16 g dwt m(-2) at Fort Augusta) with
   increasing eutrophication stress. Comparisons with previous studies from
   ten years before indicated that Thalassia testudinum shoot biomass and
   density decreased at all sites, while leaf productivity rates increased
   at oligotrophic sites and decreased at eutrophic sites during this
   period.}},

Title = {{Biology, ecology, and management of dogwood borer in eastern apple
   orchards}},

Abstract = {{The dogwood borer, Synanthedon scitula (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae),
   has the broadest host range of the clearwing moths and is considered to
   be an economically important pest of many ornamental, fruit, and nut
   trees. Since the 1980s, dogwood borer has been recognized as an
   increasingly important, indirect pest of apple, Malus domestica Borkh.
   (Rosaceae), in eastern North America, owing mainly to increased
   plantings of apple on size-controlling rootstocks that promote the
   formation of adventitious root initials (burr knots) on the rootstock
   and scion. Burr knots appear to be preferred oviposition sites for
   dogwood borer females, although infestations can also be initiated in
   wounds, pruning cuts, and crotches on the branches and trunk. Larval
   feeding in burr knots does not adversely affect the growth and vigor of
   apple trees, but their mining outward from burr knots into vascular
   tissue can ultimately cause tree decline and death. Chlorpyrifos is the
   most effective insecticide for controlling dogwood borer. A supplemental
   label in the United States permits post-bloom, trunk drench applications
   of chlorpyrifos specifically for control of borers in apple, with
   several restrictions that preclude control of infestations higher in the
   tree. The ongoing review of pesticide tolerances dictated by the 1996
   Food Quality Protection Act of the United States of America makes the
   long-term availability of this chemical uncertain. Cultural practices,
   such as deeper planting or berming, can reduce the likelihood of
   infestation of new apple plantings by dogwood borer, although they do
   not preclude infestations from developing above the graft union. This
   review and discussion is based on our contention that research toward
   the development of alternative, behaviorally based management strategies
   for dogwood borer in apple and other economically important host plants
   is warranted. Our review and synthesis of the dogwood borer literature
   revealed important gaps in knowledge about basic aspects of its biology
   that pertain directly to the development of alternative control tactics
   based on behavioral manipulation. There is considerable confusion
   surrounding the sex pheromone of dogwood borer and conflicting results
   on the response of males to isomers and blends of isomers of its
   purported pheromone. Studies using sex attractants to monitor its
   phenology in apple and non-apple habitats have yielded discrepant
   results and conclusions. Differences in the effectiveness of
   commercially available pheromone lures for trapping dogwood borer have
   been reported and the ability of pheromone traps to accurately reflect
   emergence or population density remains in question. Regardless of
   pronounced differences in the duration and modality of the seasonal
   flight of dogwood borer among different geographical regions within its
   range, the conclusion of univoltinism across most of its range has been
   perpetuated, based on extremely limited developmental data collected
   exclusively from individuals that developed on dogwood.}},

Abstract = {{The introduced red turpentine beetle, Dendroctonus valens LeConte, is
   one of the most economically important forest pests in the People's
   Republic of China, having killed more than 6 million pines in recent
   years. There is an urgent need to develop effective behavioral chemicals
   to monitor and control D. valens in the People's Republic of China, as
   well as in its native range in North America. We tested host kairomones
   as a 1:1:1 blend of alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and Delta-3-carene
   (releasing in the same proportions) for monitoring D. valens populations
   in the People's Republic of China. We also tested two release systems of
   verbenone for protection of Pinus tabuliformis Lawson from D. valens
   attack: (1) polyethylene bubblecaps (BCs) filled with 800 mg of nearly
   pure verbenone (releasing 18 mg/tree per day) and (2) a sprayable water
   suspension of microencapsulated (MEC) verbenone (releasing about 100
   mg/tree per day). The host-volatile blend trapped substantial numbers of
   both sexes of adult beetles, up to 15 beetles per day, proving its
   potential for monitoring. Both of the verbenone release systems
   significantly reduced D. valens trap catch, and there was no difference
   between the BC treatment and the MEC treatment. Both release systems
   also reduced beetle attack on trees to the same level as unbaited
   controls, from a mean of 5.1 per tree to a mean of 0.7 per tree (for
   both release systems), suggesting that the treatments may also reduce
   tree mortality.}},

Abstract = {{The proportion of wild fish in 12 mixed populations of hatchery and wild
   steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was evaluated for its relationship to
   mean and intrinsic measures of population productivity. The population
   mean of ln(recruits/spawner) was used to represent mean productivity.
   Intrinsic productivity was represented by values for the Ricker a
   parameter as estimated from fits of spawner and recruit data.
   Significant regressions (p < 0.001) were found between both measures of
   productivity and the proportion of wild fish in the spawning population
   (P-w). The slopes of the two regressions were not significantly
   different (p = 0.55) and defined a relationship suggesting that a
   spawning population comprised of equal numbers of hatchery and wild fish
   would produce 63\% fewer recruits per spawner than one comprised
   entirely of wild fish. Study findings were not sensitive to likely
   levels of data error or confounded by extraneous habitat correlation
   with P-w. Population status assessments and conservation monitoring
   efforts should include P-w as a critical variable. For natural
   populations, removal rather than addition of hatchery fish may be the
   most effective strategy to improve productivity and resilience.}},

Title = {{Temporal variation of fluoride concentration in antlers of roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) living in an area exposed to emissions from iron
   and steel industry, 1948-2000}},

Abstract = {{Temporal changes of environmental fluoride concentration in the
   industrialized area of Siegen, western Germany were assessed by studying
   the fluoride content of antlers (n = 116) collected between 1948 and
   2000 from the resident roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population. During
   the analyzed period, major fluoride emission sources in the study area
   have been iron- and steelworks. Fluoride concentrations in the antlers
   ranged between 118 and 5428 mg/kg of bone ash. There was an overall
   increase in antler fluoride content from the late 1940s/early 1950s to
   the late 1950s/mid-1960s. Thereafter, antler fluoride levels overall
   steadily declined. For statistical analysis, the data were grouped into
   five periods (1948-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1979, 1980-1989, and
   1990-2000). Geometric mean fluoride concentrations of the samples ranged
   from 323 (period 1990-2000) to 2096 mg/kg of bone ash (period
   1960-1969). Sample means for the periods 1980-1989 and 1990-2000,
   respectively, were always significantly lower than those of older
   samples. The decrease in antler fluoride concentrations during recent
   decades suggests a drop of ambient fluoride levels, that is
   hypothetically attributed to a reduction in the number of emission
   sources in the area and a decline of fluoride discharges from both local
   and more distant sources due to improved emission control measures.
   Comparison with antler fluoride data for other roe deer populations from
   western Germany further suggests that the roe deer from the Siegen area
   were recently exposed to an only moderate additional fluoride load from
   industrial sources. Studying antler fluoride concentrations is a
   convenient and cost-effective method of monitoring temporal changes in
   ambient fluoride levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the ontogeny of NK cells in control and
   early-thymectomized (Tx) Xenopus laevis through phenotypic analysis of
   cells expressing the NK cell antigen 1F8 and by performing in vitro
   cytotoxic assays. Dual color flow cytometry reveals that a few
   1F8positive splenocytes first emerge in late larval life, at similar to
   7-weeks post-fertilization. This is about 2-weeks after the time when
   surface MHC class la expression can first be detected. The proportion of
   splenocytes expressing 1F8 remains very low in 3-4 month-old froglets,
   but by 1 year there is a sizeable 1F8positive population, which is
   proportionally elevated in Tx frogs. The ontogeny of NK cell function is
   monitored by a 5 It DNA fragmentation (JAM) assay. Control and Tx larval
   splenocytes (from either 5- or 7-week-old tadpoles) fail to kill
   MHC-deficient thymus-derived tumor cell targets. Such in vitro killing
   is still relatively poor in 3-4 month froglets, compared with high
   levels of tumor cell cytotoxicity mediated by splenocytes from older
   frogs. Immunoprecipitation studies identify that the major ligand for
   the 1F8 mAb is a 55 kDa polypeptide. Finally, further evidence is
   provided that 1F8positive lymphocytes are indeed bona fide NK cells,
   distinct from T cells, since purified 1F8positive splenocytes from Tx
   Xenopus fail to express fully rearranged TCRP V region transcripts. We
   conclude that NK cells fail to develop prior to MHC class I protein
   expression and, therefore, do not contribute to the larval immune
   system, whereas they do provide an important backup for T cells in the
   adult frog by contributing to anti-tumor immunity. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This article analyzes landscape pattern in the Western Ghats mountain
   ranges in southwestern India at two scales, comparing small-scale,
   detailed studies of landscape pattern, with broader, regional-scale
   assessments of the Western Ghats. Due in large part to their
   inaccessibility, relatively little is known about the landscapes of this
   biodiverse region, which also supports some of the highest population
   densities in the world. A broad-scale NDVI-based IRS 1B satellite image
   classification is used to analyze north-south and east-west trends
   across the entire Western Ghats and western coast of India, an area over
   170 000 km(2). Northern and eastern landscapes are more fragmented
   compared to the southern and western slopes. Western slopes also have
   greater landscape diversity with land cover types more interspersed
   compared to the eastern slopes. These differences can be related to
   north-south and east-west variations in rainfall and plant distribution.
   Data from thirteen landscapes 10-50 km(2) in area, are further utilized
   to analyze trends in landscape pattern, and describe the geographical
   distribution of major natural and managed ecotope types. At this scale,
   very high levels of intra-ecotope type variability in landscape pattern
   are encountered for all land cover types. Results at these two scales
   are integrated to suggest a hierarchical stratified approach for
   monitoring land cover and biodiversity in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the stability of microbial community structures may be useful
   in advanced biological wastewater treatment system design and operation.
   In this research, a monitoring method using fatty acid profiles was
   evaluated for detecting changes in microbial community structures. For
   the evaluation, the operating parameters such as pH, organic loading,
   and chlorine addition were varied in two identical laboratory scale
   conventional activated sludge systems. A similarity index based on
   microbial fatty acid analysis was used to express the stability of
   microbial community structures in the systems. Experiments using a model
   microbial community showed that microbial compositions changed daily
   even under constant operating conditions and that the rate of change
   increased under dynamic operating conditions. Substrate changes brought
   about a relatively large change in a microbial community structure,
   eventually resulting in a very different microbial community. After only
   7 days following a substrate change in a lab-scale bioreactor, the
   biomass exhibited only 45\% similarity to the original structure. The
   analysis of microbial fatty acids conveys additional information, in
   that it could be used for the calculation of biomass concentrations in a
   wastewater treatment system if microbial fatty acid analyses are
   executed on a routine basis as a monitoring tool for biological
   wastewater treatment systems. The total fatty acid concentrations were
   about 0.61\% of the biomass concentration as mixed liquor volatile
   suspended solid concentrations in this research.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between individual growth and acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE).activity was evaluated for Daphnia magna. Analysis on the
   influence of two different culture media on baseline AChE activity was
   performed with Daphnia similis. The results indicated an inverse
   relationship between D. magna body length and AChE activity. An increase
   in total protein, which was not proportional to an increase in the rate
   of the substrate hydrolysis (Delta absorbance/min), seems to be the
   reason for this inverse size versus AChE activity relationship.
   Therefore, toxicants such as phenobarbital, which affect protein and
   size but not AChE activity directly, have an overall affect on AChE
   activity. In contrast, the AChE inhibitor parathion altered AChE
   activity but not protein. Culture medium also had a significant affect
   on AChE activity in D. similis. Changes in total protein seem to be the
   main reason for the variations in baseline AChE activity in Daphnia
   observed in the different evaluations performed in this work. Therefore,
   AChE activity in Daphnia must be interpreted carefully, and variations
   related to changes in total protein must be taken into account when
   applying this enzyme as a biomarker in biological monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of a natural resource is an important
   consideration in designing an efficient survey or monitoring program for
   the resource. We review a unified strategy for designing probability
   samples of discrete, finite resource populations, such as lakes within
   some geographical region; linear populations, such as a stream network
   in a drainage basin, and continuous, two-dimensional populations, such
   as forests. The strategy can be viewed as a generalization of spatial
   stratification. In this article, we develop a local neighborhood
   variance estimator based on that perspective, and examine its behavior
   via simulation. The simulations indicate that the local neighborhood
   estimator is unbiased and stable. The Horvitz-Thompson variance
   estimator based on assuming independent random sampling (IRS) may be two
   times the magnitude of the local neighborhood estimate. An example using
   data from a generalized random-tessellation stratified design on the
   Oahe Reservoir resulted in local variance estimates being 22 to 58
   percent smaller than Horvitz-Thompson IRS variance estimates. Variables
   with stronger spatial patterns had greater reductions in variance, as
   expected. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm formed on plexiglass panels in an Indian estuary was studied by
   monitoring its physical, chemical, biochemical and biological
   parameters. Time series investigation showed both temporal and spatial
   variations of various parameters assayed. Biofilm thickness and biomass
   showed similar trends in distribution. During an exposure period of 7
   days, the biofilm thickness ranged from 65 to 270 mum. Nutrient levels
   in the biofilm were 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher when compared to
   ambient water. Significant correlations were observed between biofilm
   thickness and biomass (r = 0.95 and p = 0.0001), diatom counts and
   hexose sugar levels (r = 0.95 and p = 0.0001) and nitrate reducers and
   ammonia production (r = 0.97 and p = 0.0001). The various bacterial
   types assayed showed a population range of 10(2) to 10(6) cfu cm(-2).
   Facultative anaerobic bacteria such as nitrate reducers (NRB) were
   observed after 24 h of biofilm growth. Although, nitrate reduction was
   observed in the biofilm up to 96 h, by the end of 168 h the estuarine
   biofilm showed significant levels of nitrate. Ammonia oxidising bacteria
   (AOB) were noticed after 96 h of biofilm growth. The biofilm was
   initially dominated by bacteria, and then followed by diatoms.
   Infestation by bacteriovores altered the biofilm community and
   architecture after 72 h of biofilm growth. The final community after 168
   h was composed of heterotrophic bacteria, NRB, AOB, diatoms, barnacle
   cyprids and oyster larvae. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   graminearum is the major pathogen worldwide, while F. culmorum, F.
   avenaceum and F. poae are also associated with this disease. In addition
   to the true Fusarium species, Microdochium nivale may also cause head
   blight and is particularly prevalent where cooler, wetter conditions
   prevail. Other species such as F. sporotrichioides, F. equiseti and even
   F. verticillioides may also be of significance in particular situations.
   FHB is of particular concern because of the ability of the Fusarium
   species to produce mycotoxins in the grain that are harmful to human and
   animal consumers. The predominant mycotoxins within cereals are the
   trichothecenes, chiefly deoxynivalenol, nivalenol and their acetylated
   derivatives, along with T-2, HT-2, diacetoxyscirpenol and neosolaniol.
   This paper reviews the use of molecular techniques to identify the
   individual causal agents and to quantify their relative amounts within
   plant tissue. Diagnostic and quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   assays have been developed to detect and quantify individual fungal
   species within the disease complex and, where relevant, to differentiate
   between chemotypes within a single species. Assays to determine the type
   of toxin produced, or monitor the regulation of toxin production also
   provide valuable tools for understanding this disease. These techniques
   are being used to dissect the disease complex into its component parts
   in order to study interactions between the pathogens and their host and
   between the pathogens themselves as well as to determine the influence
   of environmental factors on the disease and the toxins produced by these
   fungi.}},

   transmission of microsporidial gill disease caused by L. salmonae in
   rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Fish were experimentally infected
   with L. salmonae via a cohabitation exposure model and monitored for the
   development of branchial xenomas. On any given day, fish held at
   11degreesC and 15degreesC had a hazard ratio equal to 0.80 and 0.68,
   respectively, for the development of branchial xenomas compared with
   fish held at 19degreesC. From the flow rate trial, fish housed in a low
   flow tank (0.83 L/min) had an increased chance of developing branchial
   xenomas when compared to fish in tanks at normal (1.67 L/min) and high
   (2.5 L/min) flow rates with hazard ratios reported as 0.69.}},

   The lowest number of moths was found in the hills located in the eastern
   region of the state. An annual profile of beet armyworm populations in
   the western section of the Mississippi Delta also revealed that
   wide-scale immigration of this pest typically begins at 200 Julian days

   on turf grass in South Africa}},

Abstract = {{Very little information on the ecology and pest status of the fossorial
   rove beetle, Neosorius brevipennis Fagel is available (Smetana 1985).
   These beetles tunnel underground and lay their eggs in clusters of three
   to ten in the blind ends of tunnels. It was found by sampling and
   observation that N brevipennis were responsible for casting mounds on
   golf course putting greens in Johannesburg and Pretoria (Schoeman 1997).
   Soil castings may damage mowing equipment, interfere with play by
   deflecting putts, and are objectionable for aesthetic reasons. A study
   of a fossorial rove beetle (Osorius planifrons Leconte), responsible for
   casting mounds on greens at the Tucson Country Club, Tuscon, AZ, USA,
   was conducted in the late 1970s. That study included ecological and
   behavioral analysis and concluded that O. planifrons requires high soil
   moisture and probably feeds on soil microbes (Smith et al. 1978). The
   authors discussed cultural control but no chemical or biological control
   methods were addressed.
   The objectives of this study were to determine the annual population
   densities and soil profile distributions of N brevipennis on bent grass
   (Agrostis stolonifera L.) and kikuyu grass (Penisetum clandestinum
   Hochst. ex. Chiov.). The efficacy of chemical controls for N.
   brevipennis was also investigated. Neosorius brevipennis was sampled at
   the Wingate Park Country Club (WPCC) in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa
   (25degrees44'S, 28degrees15'E). Chemical trials were conducted at
   Kensington golf course in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa
   (28degrees40'S, 25degrees10'E). The study was conducted from November
   1999 to October 2000.
   Five random samples were taken with a putting green hole cutter
   (diameter: 110 mm and depth: 100 mm) on a green (bent grass) and on a
   fairway (kikuyu grass), respectively, to examine the distribution and
   population densities of adult and immature rove beetles in the soil
   profile. Eggs were not included in the study. Soil cores were examined
   in 25 mm thick sections and all stages found at each depth were
   recorded. The 10 samples were collected and analyzed monthly from
   November 1999 to October 2000 to determine the population density of N.
   brevipennis throughout the year. The distribution of N. brevipennis
   between the upper 50 mm. and 51-100 mm of the soil profile and between
   green (bent grass) and fairway (kikuyu grass) samples were compared
   using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test.
   Ten random plots of 0.25 m(2) (0.5 m x 0.5 m) were sampled to determine
   the mean number of casting mounds per 0.25 m(2). After assessments were
   made, 100 individual mounds were collected in poly-top-containers and
   the average dry mass per mound was measured in the laboratory with a
   Sartorius scale. Data were collected mid-day on putting green 9 at WPCC
   in mid April 2000, at an average surface temperature of 25.9degreesC.
   The chemical trials were conducted at the beginning of 2000 (8 January-3
   March). The infested putting green 12 on Kensington golf course was
   divided into six blocks of 28 m(2) (3.00 m x 9.33 m). Five chemicals
   (carbaryl, fipronil, imidacloprid, isofenphos and azinphos-methyl),
   formulated as a WP, SC, SC, EC and EC, respectively, were tested. Blocks
   were randomly allocated to each chemical and a control (untreated) area.
   Insecticides were applied to the turf surface with a backpack sprayer at
   the typical turf rate (Table 1). Application was followed by irrigation
   (using the golf course irrigation system) for 9 min (equivalent of 10 mm
   precipitation) to water the insecticides into the soil. The control
   block was also watered with the same volume. The treated and untreated
   blocks were monitored weekly (at mid-day) for soil mounds or
   ``push-ups{''} for eight consecutive weeks, starting 5 d after the
   single chemical application. Five randomly selected 0.11 m(2) (a circle
   with a diameter of 375 mm) areas in each block were used to count the
   number of soil mounds present each week (to test the temporal efficiency
   of the different chemicals). A MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of
   Variance) and post hoe Tukey HSD (Honest Significant Difference) test
   was used to separate means. The statistical analysis of all the data was
   conducted on the software program ``Statistica{''}, Version: 5 (1995)

Abstract = {{The endemic New Zealand red alga Gigartina atropurpurea has been
   identified as a candidate for aquaculture because of its high quality
   and value carrageenan and its broad-bladed morphology. As G.
   atropurpurea has not so far been exploited commercially, trials were
   conducted to investigate the effect of timing and frequency of pruning
   on the growth of plants in the wild and explants on ropes, in spring,
   and autumn. Plants were monitored monthly by measuring the length of the
   two longest blades (a proxy for biomass) and wet weights of all plant
   material retrieved. The results suggested five broad conclusions: (1)
   spring growth was much greater than autumn growth; (2) regardless of
   season, maximal growth rates were achieved 4-6 weeks post pruning; (3)
   pruning accelerated growth; (4) pruning plants twice during spring
   generated up to four times more biomass than when plants were pruned
   only once, and (5) there was no difference in the response of farmed and
   wild plants to pruning treatments. Based upon these preliminary trials,
   plant material from wild tetrasporic and female G. atropurpurea could be
   `harvested' up to three times during the growth period
   (August-December). However, further research on the feasibility of G.
   atropurpurea aquaculture is justified.}},

Abstract = {{Great tits Parus major have generally much poorer breeding success in
   northern Finland than in mid- and western Europe. The aim of this study
   is to find out whether the poor success is linked to foraging behaviour.
   This was studied by monitoring great tits' foraging behaviour and food
   abundance in different substrates during the breeding cycle in two
   populations, N Finland (65degreesN) and Latvia (56degreesN). It was
   shown that breeding success, from eggs to fledglings, was significantly
   poorer (56\% vs. 93\%) and caterpillar abundance considerably lower in
   the northern population. The general patterns in foraging behaviour were
   the same in N Finland and Latvia (especially the preference of birches
   Betula spp.) indicating that great tits used basically the same
   species-typical foraging strategy in both populations. However, thin
   branches of birch were preferred in the north but avoided in Latvia,
   which may suggest that northern great tits have changed their foraging
   niche towards the outer parts of canopy, a niche typically occupied by
   the blue tit. This shift is theoretically advantageous, since the outer
   parts of the canopy are the richest caterpillar source. In practice,
   however, the poorer success of great tits indicates that this is not a
   beneficial strategy. Primarily, great tits in the northern population
   seem to be food limited since they lay too large clutches in relation to
   accessible food resources. This may be because great tits are not
   adapted to lower caterpillar production in the northern margins of their
   distribution and cannot change their narrow diet (3/4 caterpillars),
   like e.g. willow tits can. In search for caterpillars, food
   accessibility is further limited because the great tits' normal foraging
   behaviour, with wide search radius, may not function properly in the
   denser, outer parts of the canopy. Great tits may also be too heavy to
   forage efficiently on leafed twigs.}},

Abstract = {{Aim This study documents the effects of multiple fires and drought on
   the woody structure of a north Australian savanna never grazed by
   domestic stock.
   Location The study was conducted in a 500 ha pocket of
   Eucalyptus-dominated savanna surrounded by a late Quaternary lava flow.
   The flow is known as the Great Basalt Wall, located c. 50 km northeast
   of Charters Towers in semi-arid north-eastern Australia. This region was
   exposed to the largest 5-year rainfall deficit on record between 1992
   and 1996.
   Methods All individual woody plants were tagged within a 1.56 ha plot.
   Species were segregated into their habitat affinities (rain forest,
   ecotone, savanna) and regeneration strategy (resprouter, seeder). The
   survivorship of plants within these categories was analysed in relation
   to fire intensity from the first fire, and to each of four fires lit
   between 1996 and 2001.
   Results Before the first fire, the plot contained thirty-one tree
   species including twenty-one typical of the surrounding dry rain forest.
   These rain forest species were represented by small individuals and
   constituted <1\% of the total basal area of woody plants. The basal area
   of savanna trees was 7.5 m(2) ha(-1) at the commencement of monitoring,
   although 31\% had recently died and others had major crown damage.
   Further death of the drought debilitated savanna trees was substantial
   during the first year of monitoring and the basal area of live savanna
   trees declined to 1.1 m(-2) ha(-1) after 5 years. Most species from both
   rain forest and savanna were classified as resprouters and are capable
   of regenerating from underground organs after fire. Species without this
   ability (rain forest seeders and ecotone seeders) were mostly eliminated
   after the first two consecutive fires. Among resprouters, survivorship
   declined as fire intensity increased and this was more pronounced for
   rain forest than for savanna species. Repeated burning produced a
   cumulative effect of decreasing survivorship for rain forest resprouters
   relative to savanna resprouters.
   Main conclusions The study provides evidence that savanna and rain
   forest trees differ in fire susceptibility and that recurrent fire can
   explain the restricted distribution of rain forest in the seasonally
   arid Australian tropics. The time of death of the savanna trees is
   consistent with the regional pattern after severe drought, and
   highlights the importance of medium term climate cycles for the
   population dynamics of savanna tree species and structure of Australian
   savannas.}},

Abstract = {{Chromium has become an important soil contaminant at many sites, and
   facilitating in situ reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to nontoxic Cr(III) is
   becoming an attractive remediation strategy. Acceleration of Cr(VI)
   reduction in soils by addition of organic carbon was tested in columns
   pretreated with solutions containing 1000 and 10 000 mg L-1 Cr(VI) to
   evaluate potential in situ remediation of highly contaminated soils.
   Solutions containing 0, 800, or 4000 mg L-1 organic carbon in the form
   of tryptic soy broth or lactate were diffused into the
   Cr(VI)contaminated soils. Changes in Cr oxidation state were monitored
   through periodic micro-XANES analyses of soil columns. Effective
   first-order reduction rate constants ranged from 1.4 x 10(-8) to 1.5 x
   10(-7) s(-1), with higher values obtained for lower levels of initial
   Cr(VI) and higher levels of organic carbon. Comparisons with sterile
   soils showed that microbially dependent processes were largely
   responsible for Cr(VI) reduction, except in the soils initially exposed
   to 10 000 mg L-1 Cr(VI) solutions that receive little (800 mg L-1) or no
   organic carbon. However, the microbial populations (less than or equal
   to2.1 x 10(5) g(-1)) in the viable soils are probably too low for direct
   enzymatic Cr(VI) reduction to be important. Thus, synergistic effects
   sustained in whole soil systems may have accounted for most of the
   observed reduction. These results show that acceleration of in situ
   Cr(VI) reduction with addition of organic carbon is possible in even
   heavily contaminated soils and suggest that microbially dependent
   reduction pathways can be dominant.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of time of season on the accuracy of species
   number estimation from point-count data collected at 28 oases from
   southern Tunisia. Each oasis was visited at the beginning of the
   breeding season and two months later, which allowed us to conduct counts
   on five points per oasis per visit. For each oasis, we considered the
   observed species number as the total number of species recorded during
   each visit, and we used a capture-recapture approach to estimate species
   number from patterns of presence and absence of species over the five
   points. We found that birds were more detectable at the beginning of the
   breeding season than two months later, and the observed species number
   showed a significant decrease between the two periods. However, when a
   capture-recapture approach accounting for heterogeneity in species
   detectability was used, similar estimates were obtained from data
   collected during both periods. Nonetheless, the estimates obtained at
   the beginning of the breeding season were more precise than those
   obtained later. Overall, our results illustrate once more the need of
   taking into account time of season as an important source of bias when
   attempting to determine species richness from count data, and stress the
   need for using probabilistic approaches in such an investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Arrays of wood cover boards are useful tools for studying and monitoring
   plethodontid salamander populations. However, little is known about the
   biases inherent in monitoring data collected from such arrays. We used
   Red-Backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, to test for two potential
   biases associated with use of wood cover board arrays. First, we tested
   whether frequent sampling of arrays can cause reduced counts of
   salamanders, resulting in the appearance of population declines where
   none exist. Second, we tested whether salamanders found under wood cover
   boards differed from salamanders found under natural cover objects in
   terms of sex ratios, stage class ratios, and snout-vent length. We found
   that sampling cover boards daily substantially reduced salamander counts
   under cover objects and that this result was pronounced for adults but
   not for juveniles. We found no decrease in counts with sampling cover
   boards weekly as compared to sampling every three weeks. With respect to
   differences between salamanders found underneath cover boards versus
   natural cover objects, we found that samples from under cover boards
   contained higher proportions of adults and lower proportions of
   juveniles and hatchlings than did natural cover objects. This was true
   in both the spring and fall. There were no differences in sex ratios or
   in snout-vent length within stage classes for salamanders in cover
   boards versus natural cover objects. These results suggest that cover
   boards used for monitoring or for studies of ecology and behavior should
   be sampled no more than once per week if natural levels of movement and
   territoriality are desired. Additionally, although cover board arrays
   may be suitable for tracking relative changes in overall population
   size, bias among size classes may make cover boards less than ideal
   tools for studies of salamander demography.}},

Abstract = {{We studied Diamondback Terrapins, Malaclemys terrapin, at Gateway
   National Recreation Area, New York. We found evidence of nesting
   terrapins at three locations within the Recreation Area and focused our
   research on the islands of Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. Female terrapins
   nested from early June through early August and oviposited at least two
   clutches per year. Mean clutch size was 10.9 eggs. Nesting activity
   increased with daily high temperature and high tide. The greatest number
   of terrapin nests was found in shrubland, dune, and mixed-grassland
   habitats, but nest densities were higher on a human-made sandy trail and
   on sandy beaches. We estimate that approximately 2053 nests were
   oviposited on the largest island in the refuge in 1999. In 1998 and
   1999, we counted 1319 and 1840 depredated nests, respectively,
   throughout the refuge. Raccoons were introduced into Jamaica Bay
   Wildlife Refuge approximately 20 yr prior to this study. Raccoons
   depreciated 92.2\% of nests monitored on the largest island during the
   1999 nesting season. We also found the carcasses of adult female
   terrapins that apparently were killed by raccoons as they came on land
   to nest. This terrapin population may be undergoing demographic changes
   as a result of the introduction of raccoons.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the response of Mountain Yellow-Legged Frogs to short
   distance translocations, I placed transmitters on 20 adult frogs and
   moved them short distances from 144-630 m and monitored their responses
   for up to 30 days. Of the 20 translocated frogs, seven frogs returned to
   their original capture site, four frogs moved in the direction of their
   capture site but had not returned by the end of the study, and nine
   frogs did not return and were found at the translocation site.
   Apparently, displacing frogs was stressful, and translocated frogs lost
   body mass during the study period. Eighteen translocated frogs that were
   weighed at the beginning and end of the study lost body mass (mean loss
   was -1.2 g) compared to a group of 18 randomly selected PIT tagged frogs
   also weighed during the same tracking period (mean gain in body mass =
   2.5 g) at our Kings Canyon study site. Translocation of adult Rana
   muscosa as a conservation toot may not be effective because some would
   simply attempt to return to their original capture site, and their
   homing may be stressful to an already declining frog population.}},

Abstract = {{The development of Anabaena ucrainica blooms in a small agricultural
   reservoir was monitored in 1998 and 1999. In the reservoir, numerous
   Anabaena akinetes were found in all regions of the sediment analyzed,
   with an average cell density in the uppermost layer (0-2 cm) of 1.5 x
   10(4) cm(-3). Anabaena ucrainica filament numbers began to increase
   exponentially in mid-May 1998 and in late April 1999, when the water
   temperature exceeded 15degreesC. The average in situ net growth rate was
   0.18 day(-1) as measured by filament numbers. The effect of temperature
   on germination of the akinetes was investigated using Anabaena akinetes
   taken from the reservoir sediment. High germination percentages were
   observed at temperatures between 14 and 23degreesC; however, the
   Anabaena akinetes did not germinate without irradiance. Growth
   experiments using an axenic culture of A. ucrainica isolated from the
   reservoir showed that an increase in incubation temperature to
   26degreesC resulted in a rise in the specific growth rate. Consequently,
   it was hypothesized that temperature increases could similarly enhance
   the growth rate of A. ucrainica during bloom development. Furthermore,
   judging from the in situ growth rate of A. ucrainica, initial inocula
   arising from dense akinete populations in the sediment would advance
   bloom formation and could enhance the relative probability of Anabaena
   bloom formation.}},

Abstract = {{Eastern Newfoundland contains a large breeding population of Bald Eagles
   (Haliaeetus leucocelihalus). Our objectives were to determine the
   reproductive success, contaminant levels, and trophic statis of Bald
   Eagles in eastern Newfoundland, and to compare contaminant levels of
   eagles in industrialized and noninclustrialized coastal bays (Placentia
   and Bonavista bays, respectively). Bald Eagle breeding density in
   eastern Newfoundland was 0.09 occupied nests/km shoreline, and
   reproductive success suggested a healthy population (1.1 young/occupied
   nest). Geometric mean concentrations of PCBs and DDE in nestling plasma
   were significantly higher in Placentia Bay (PCBs = 30.0 ng/g {[}wet wt];
   DDE = 9.0 ng/g) than in Bonavista Bay (PCBs - 10.0 ng/g; DDE - 2.0
   ng/g). Within Placentia Bay, concentrations of PCBs and DDE in nestlings
   were negatively related to the nest distance from the former U.S. naval
   base at Argentia. Geometric mean concentration of mercury in whole blood
   of eagle nestlings was 87 ng/g (wet wt). Analysis of prey remains
   collected at nests and of stable-carbon (C-13/ C-12) and nitrogen
   (N-15/N-14) isotope ratios in nestling blood indicated some differences
   between nests in food sources, but not in relative trophic level. Prey
   remains collected at 30 Bald Eagle nests were composed of 64\% birds,
   29\% fish, and 7\% mammals. Contaminant burdens in Bald Eagles in
   eastern Newfoundland were lower than those in populations from more
   industrialized areas of North America and were below thresholds for
   reproductive impairment. These results provide all essential baseline
   for future monitoring of the eagle population as industrial development
   increases in Placentia Bay.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the dynamics of phytoplankton communities has been
   limited by the space and timescales associated with traditional
   monitoring approaches. To overcome some of these limitations, we have
   developed a submersible flow cytometer (FlowCytobot) that is designed
   for extended autonomous monitoring of phytoplankton abundance, cell
   size, and pigmentation. FlowCytobot was moored on the seafloor from late
   July to October 2001 at the Long-term Environmental Observatory study
   site off the coast of New Jersey, and water samples from 5 m depth were
   pumped continuously through the instrument. Analysis of cells' optical
   properties revealed distinct populations of Synechococcus and
   cryptophytes, as well as an assemblage of other pico- and
   nanophytoplankton of mixed taxonomy. For each of these groups, dramatic
   variations in cell concentration were observed within the sampling
   period. Diel variations in cell scattering, which are indicative of
   changes in cell size, were consistent with patterns of cell growth
   during the light period and cell division late in the day. We developed
   a size-structured matrix population model that accommodates simultaneous
   growth and division and then used the model and size distribution data
   from FlowCytobot to estimate daily specific growth rates for
   Synechococcus; these estimates are independent of cell concentration and
   do not include mortality. The results show that a dramatic autumn
   decline in the concentration of Synechococcus can be attributed to a
   decrease in the specific growth rate rather than to effects of physical
   transport processes or trophic interactions.}},

Title = {{Ecology, status and conservation of short-beaked common dolphins
   Delphinus delphis in the Mediterranean Sea}},
Journal = {{MAMMAL REVIEW}},

Abstract = {{1. The recent decline in the Mediterranean population of short-beaked
   common dolphins Delphinus delphis has been the subject of scientific
   controversy and political indifference. Research on these animals has
   been very limited and there has been no large-scale, systematic effort
   to assess and monitor their abundance and distribution. The consequent
   lack of data has prevented a good understanding of historical and
   ongoing trends.
   2. Nonetheless, literature and osteological collections confirm that
   common dolphins were widespread and abundant in much of the
   Mediterranean Sea until the late 1960s and that their decline occurred
   relatively quickly. Today, common dolphins remain relatively abundant
   only in the westernmost portion of the basin (Alboran Sea), with sparse
   records off Algeria and Tunisia, concentrations around the Maltese
   islands and in parts of the Aegean Sea, and relict groups in the
   south-eastern Tyrrhenian and eastern Ionian Seas. Otherwise, these
   dolphins are rare in, or completely absent from, Mediterranean areas
   where information is available.
   3. Circumstantial evidence and qualitative judgements by the authors
   suggest that the following factors may have contributed to the decline
   of common dolphins: reduced availability of prey caused by overfishing
   and habitat degradation; contamination by xenobiotic chemicals resulting
   in immunosuppression and reproductive impairment; environmental changes
   such as increased water temperatures affecting ecosystem dynamics; and
   incidental mortality in fishing gear, especially gillnets. The
   cumulative importance of these factors is poorly understood, and as a
   result, few conservation measures have been implemented.
   4. This paper reviews current knowledge and suggests priorities for
   action aimed at identifying and mitigating the main threats to common
   dolphins in the Mediterranean, with the ultimate goal of restoring the
   species' favourable conservation status in the region.}},

Abstract = {{The invasive oriental mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse)
   (Diptera: Culicidae) was detected on Bioko Island for the first time in
   November 2001. It was found to be well established breeding in
   artificial containers at Planta, near Malabo, the capital of Equatorial
   Guinea. Associated species of mosquito larvae were Aedes aegypti (L.),
   Ae. africanus (Theobald), Culex near decens Theobald, Cx. duttoni
   Theobald, Cx. quinquefasciatus Say, Cx. tigripes De Grandpre \& De
   Charmoy, Eretmapodites quinquevittatus Theobald and Mansonia africana
   (Theobald). This is the third tropical African country to be invaded by
   Ae. albopictus, which has recently spread to many parts of the Americas
   and Europe - with vector competence for dengue, yellow fever and other
   arboviruses. In the Afro-tropical environment, it will be interesting to
   monitor the ecological balance and/or displacement between introduced
   Ae. albopictus and indigenous Ae. aegpyti (domestic, peri-domestic and
   sylvatic populations).}},

Abstract = {{The shortjaw kokopu (Galaxias postvectis), although widely distributed
   throughout New Zealand, is only known from a few sites and generally
   with extremely low population numbers. Two sites in Taranaki (Katikara
   Stream and Stony River tributary) were found to contain relatively high
   densities of shortjaw kokopu. These sites were monitored at 6-monthly
   intervals over 3(1)/(2) years to gather site fidelity and growth rate
   data. Half-way through the sampling period the riparian vegetation
   alongside the Katikara Stream site was destroyed. Although this was
   unfortunate, it allowed examination of the impact of a disturbance event
   of this nature on shortjaw kokopu growth and behaviour. The density of
   shortjaw kokopu in Katikara Stream was about twice that in the Stony
   River tributary, whose population was characterised by fewer but larger
   individuals. Growth rate was significantly greater for smaller fish, and
   varied between the two sites. Fish in the Katikara Stream were generally
   site loyal with only a small percentage of mobile fish; however, greater
   movement from sites was noted immediately after the disturbance event.}},

Abstract = {{In cassava fields, two species of predatory mites, Typhlodromalus aripo
   and T. manihoti, co-occur at the plant level and feed on Mononychellus
   tanajoa, a herbivorous mite. The two predator species are spatially
   segregated within the plant: T. manihoti dwells on the middle leaves,
   while T. aripo occurs in the apices of the plant during the day and
   moves to the first leaves below the apex at night.
   To monitor the prey densities experienced by the two predator species in
   their micro-environment, we assessed prey and predator populations in
   apices and on the leaves of cassava plants in the field. Prey densities
   peaked from November to January and reached the lowest levels in July.
   They were higher on leaves than in the apices. To test whether the life
   histories of the two predator species are tuned to the prey density they
   experience, we measured age-specific fecundity and survival of the two
   predators under three prey density regimes (I prey female/72 h, I prey
   female/24 h and above the predators level of satiation). T. manihoti had
   a higher growth rate than T. aripo at high prey densities, mainly due to
   its higher fecundity. T. aripo had a higher growth rate at low prey
   density regimes, due to its late fecundity and survival. Thus, each of
   the two species perform better under the prey density that characterizes
   their micro-habitat within the plant.}},

Abstract = {{The damson hop aphid, Phorodon humuli (Schrank) (Hemiptera: Aphididae),
   is one of the most important sucking pests of many hop-growing areas
   world-wide. In this study we determined the efficacy of several
   insecticides against strains collected throughout the year 2001. All
   strains were collected in different hop gardens in the Hallertau
   (Bavaria), Germany, the largest hop-growing area of the world. First of
   all we established a leaf dip bioassay, carried out using six-well
   tissue culture plates and appropriate for monitoring susceptibility
   against imidacloprid, oxydemeton-methyl, cyfluthrin, amitraz,
   pymetrozine and pirimicarb. Four of these compounds, imidacloprid,
   cyfluthrin, pymetrozine and amitraz, are currently registered for the
   control of sucking pests in German hop gardens and are useful against P
   humuli. The leaf-dip bioassay system turned out to be very reliable and
   robust. Ten P. humuli strains were collected in May 2001 and maintained
   in the laboratory to assess their resistance to the different
   insecticides in comparison with two laboratory reference strains (H2 and
   H5). Using diagnostic concentrations, resistance monitoring for
   imidacloprid and cyfluthrin was investigated during July and August 2001
   on 53 populations from 30 sites around the Hallertau, an area of ca
   2500km(2). Resistance to diagnostic concentrations (LC95 for reference
   strains) of imidacloprid, amitraz and pymetrozine was not detected in
   any strain received in 2001, but late-season (August) populations seemed
   to respond more heterogeneously than those collected mid-season (July).
   Overall composite mean mortalities to diagnostic concentrations of
   imidacloprid (13 mg litre(-1)) in collections from May, July and August
   were 95 (+/-2.5), 98 (+/-2.3) and 87 (+/-5.9)\%, respectively. Moderate
   resistance to pyrethroids was observed in all strains collected in May
   and August using a diagnostic concentrations of 10 mg litre(-1)
   cyfluthrin (LC95 of the susceptible reference strain 115). Slight to
   moderate resistance to diagnostic concentrations of oxydemeton-methyl
   and pirimicarb was observed in some, but not all, strains collected
   early season. The results are discussed in terms of the implemention of
   hop aphid resistance management strategies in German hop-cultivation
   areas. (C) 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Among all organisms, the dinoflagellates display the highest diversity
   in their plastids, indicating multiple plastid origins from a broad
   variety of algae by replacing the common peridinin-containing plastid.
   One such replacement seems to have taken place in the genus Dinophysis,
   where the plastids show characteristics of a cryptomonad. Natural
   populations of D. acuminata, D. acuta and D. norvegica were collected
   from the Baltic Sea, North Sea and northern Atlantic Ocean. We sequenced
   a 430 bp fragment of the psbA gene from 16 thoroughly washed single
   cells of three Dinophysis species from different regions to monitor the
   variation between species and regions. There wits no sequence variation
   between species or regions, indicating either slow evolution or the
   highly specific engulfment of a narrow range of cryptomonad species. A
   larger region (799 bp) of the psbA gene was sequenced from D. norvegica
   cells and four cryptomonads to determine the phylogenetic position of
   the plastid sequence. In the resulting phylogeny the psbA sequence of D.
   norvegica appeared as a sister to those from Chroomonas sp. M1312,
   Cryptomonas sp. M1094 and Rhodomonas sp. KAC 30 with Guillardia theta as
   the most ancestral sequence.}},

Abstract = {{In order to establish a model system for comparative studies of C-3 and
   C-3-C-4 intermediate photosynthesis, the development of efficient
   transformation systems and the monitoring of transgene behaviour and
   stability were carried out in two closely related Moricandia species
   (Brassicaceae): the C-3-C-4 photosynthetic intermediate species M.
   arvensis and the C3 species M. moricandioides. In this study the green
   fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter gene was used as a vital marker gene
   while the use of the beta-glucuronidase (gusA) gene was based on the
   highly sensitive detection of its activity. For Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation of leaf explants, a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S
   promoter-driven, modified version of gfp, the mgfp5-ER gene and the gusA
   gene, respectively, were introduced into the new dual binary
   transformation vector system pGreen/pSoup (Hellens et al. 2000, Plant
   Mol Bio 42: 819-832). GFP5 produced bright-green fluorescence in
   transformed tissues that was distinctly detected 5-12 days following
   transformation in developing calli of the two species. Visual screening,
   combined with antibiotic selection, enabled early and easy
   identification of transformation events and contributed to improvements
   in the transformation strategies. Transgene integration studies
   demonstrated that mgfp5-ER was inserted with low copy number in the M.
   arvensis plant lines and the transgene was transmitted in a Mendelian
   fashion to T-1 and T-2 progenies. GFP5 expression levels in a population
   of 100 independent primary transformed M. arvensis plant lines (T-0)
   showed great variation between transformation events ( coefficient of
   variation of 108\%). The mgfp5-ER or gusA reporter genes were expressed
   in 90-95\% of the kanamycin-resistant M. arvensis plant lines and in up
   to 98\% of the independent M. moricandioides plant lines.}},

Abstract = {{Peat moss-based potting mix was amended with either of two composted
   swine wastes, CSW1 and CSW2. at rates from 4 to 20\% (vol/vol) to
   evaluate suppression of pre-emergence damping-off of impatiens
   (Impatiens balsamina) caused by Rhizoctonia solani (anastomosis
   group-4). A cucumber bioassay was used prior to each impatiens
   experiment to monitor maturity of compost as the compost aged in a
   curing pile by evaluating, disease suppression toward both Pythium
   ultimum and R. solani. At 16,24,32, and 37 weeks after composting, plug
   trays filled with compost-amended potting mix were seeded with impatiens
   and infested with R. solani to determine suppression of damping-off.
   Pre-emergence damping-off was lower for impatiens gown in potting mix
   amended with 20\% CSW1 than in CSW2-amended and nonamended mixes. To
   identify relationships between disease suppression and microbial
   parameters, samples of mixes were collected to determine microbial
   activity, biomass carbon and nitrogen, functional diversity, and
   population density. Higher rates of microbial activity were observed
   with increasing rates of CSW1 amendment than with CSW2 amendments.
   Microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen also were higher in CSW1-amended
   mixes than in CSW2-amended potting mixes 1 day prior to seeding and 5
   weeks after seeding. Principal component analysis of Biolog-GN2 profiles
   showed different functional diversities between CSW1- and CSW2-amended
   mixes. Furthermore, mixes amended with CSW1 had higher colony forming
   units of fungi, endospore-forming bacteria, and oligotrophic bacteria.
   Our results suggest that enhanced microbial activity, functional and
   population diversity of stable compost-amended mix were associated with
   suppressiveness to Rhizoctonia damping-off in impatiens.}},

Abstract = {{The population density of the reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus
   reniformis, was monitored at depths of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 90, and
   90 to 120 cm in a tillage and crop sequence trial in south Texas in 2000
   and 2001. Main plots were subjected to three different tillage systems:
   conventional tillage (moldboard plowing and disking), ridge tillage, and
   notillage. Subplots were planted with three different crop sequences:
   spring cotton and fall corn every year; spring cotton and fall corn in
   one year, followed by corn for two years; and cotton followed by corn
   and then grain sorghum, one spring crop per year. The population density
   of R. reniformis on corn and grain sorghum was low throughout the soil
   profile. In plots planted with spring cotton and fall corn every year,
   fewer nematodes were found at depths of 60 to 120 cm in the no-tillage
   and ridge tillage systems than in the conventional tillage system.
   Population densities were lower at depths of 0 to 60 cm than at 60 to
   120 cm. Soil moisture and cotton root length did not affect nematode
   population densities in the field. When soil was placed in pots and
   planted with cotton in the greenhouse, lower population densities
   developed in soil taken from depths of 0 to 60 cm than in soil from
   depths of 60 to 120 cm. Final nematode populations were similar in size
   in soil from the different tillage systems, but reproductive factors
   were higher in soil from plots with reduced-tillage systems than in soil
   from plots with conventional tillage. Reduced-tillage practices lowered
   the risk of increases in R. reniformis populations and reduced
   population densities following 2 years of nonhosts throughout soil
   depths, but population densities resurged to the same high levels as in
   soil planted with cotton every year during one season of cotton.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to test whether or not cyclization recombination
   (CRE), the P1 phage site-specific recombinase,induces genome
   rearrangements in plastids. Testing was carried out in tobacco plants in
   which a DNA sequence, located between two inversely oriented locus of
   X-over of P1 (loxP) sites, underwent repeated cycles of inversions as a
   means of monitoring CRE activity. We report here that CRE mediates
   deletions between loxP sites and plastid DNA sequences in the 3'rps12
   gene leader (lox-rps12) or in the psbA promoter core (lox-psbA). We also
   observed deletions between two directly oriented lox-psbA sites, but not
   between lox-rps12 sites. Deletion via duplicated rRNA operon promoter
   (Prm) sequences was also frequent in CRE-active plants. However,
   CRE-mediated recombination is probably not directly involved, as no
   recombination junction between loxP and Prrn could be observed. Tobacco
   plants carrying deleted genomes as a minor fraction of the plastid
   genome population were fertile and phenotypically normal, suggesting
   that the absence of deleted genome segments was compensated by gene
   expression from wild-type copies. The deleted plastid genomes
   disappeared in the seed progeny lacking CRE. Observed plastid genome
   rearrangements are specific to engineered plastid genomes, which contain
   at least one loxP site or duplicated psbA promoter sequences. The
   wild-type plastid genome is expected to be stable, even if CRE is
   present in the plastid.}},

Abstract = {{Cades Cove, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, U.S.A. was historically
   cleared largely for pastoral purposes; it is now comprised of recently
   abandoned pastures dominated by non-native pasture species. To
   investigate the potential for reducing non-native species relative to
   native species, park managers initiated an experiment in 1995 that
   included mowing, herbicide application, planting of seed, and burning of
   replicate 20 x 50-m plots at each of two sites within Cades Cove.
   Between 1995 and 2001 we evaluated the response of the plant community
   (i.e., species-specific cover and frequency, biomass, diversity) to this
   suite of treatments and compared it with unmanipulated control plots at
   each site. Four years after treatment initiation abundance measures of
   Plantago lanceolata , Setaria geniculata , and Trifolium spp. averaged
   one-third lower in treated than control plots. Frequency of Festuca
   pratensis was lower in treated than in control plots for 2 years, but
   after 4 years its frequency, cover, and biomass did not differ between
   treated and control plots. By 2000 the cover of Sorghastrum nutans in
   treated plots increased to 23-47\%, depending on the site. Total biomass
   and diversity increased in treated plots. The dominance of Lespedeza
   cuneata at one site apparently reduced planting success, biomass
   production, and diversity and evenness. Post-treatment lags in response
   for several species, coupled with interannual variation in response to
   environmental conditions, suggest that evaluations of treatment success
   would differ greatly depending on when the evaluation was conducted.}},

Abstract = {{The real impact on downstream fish populations of a change in management
   of a hydropower installation, in particular, the impact of an increase
   in instream minimum flow, can be difficult to assess. Other factors, in
   addition to the simple habitat limitations in low-flow periods, can
   influence the evolution of a fish population over time. It has often
   observed in French streams that the 0+ individuals appear limited by
   strong discharge in the first months after their emergence (March to
   May). A dynamic model of a trout populations (MODYPOP) has been applied
   to the river Roizonne in the French Alps, upstream and downstream of a
   hydropower station, in order to estimate the effect of different
   discharge time series on trout population dynamics. Trout populations
   were monitored by means of annual inventories at two study sites, one
   with minimum flow and the other with natural flow. At each site,
   available habitat was described and simulated as it changed with
   discharge, according to the `microhabitat' method (EVHA, derived from
   PHABSIM). Habitat time series were built on the basis of discharge time
   series. MODYPOP simulations, integrating habitat and discharge time
   series, were compared with observed fish numbers. Results indicated that
   fluctuations in discharge during the post-emergence period played a
   major role in the dynamics of the total population. Predictions were
   significantly improved when the impact of strong discharge on emerging
   fry was integrated in the model. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{A behaviourally based fish protection system was installed in a power
   canal at a hydroelectric facility on the Exploits River, Grand
   Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland, Canada. The river contains an anadromous
   wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) population in the order of 30 000
   returning adults annually. A floating louvre and bypass was installed to
   protect downstream migrating smolt from entering penstocks and turbines
   at the end of a power canal at the generating facility. The efficiency
   and effectiveness of this protection system has been evaluated since
   1997 through a combination of conventional tagging (passive integrated
   transponder, Floy and streamer tags) and use of radio telemetry.
   Detailed velocity profiling was also conducted along the louvre array,
   bypass, and throughout the canal to assess the hydraulic performance of
   the protection system. Initial monitoring in 1997 and 1998 indicated low
   fish guidance efficiencies (FGEs) for smolt of 25 and 24.3\%,
   respectively. In 1998, a digital spectrum processing (DSP) telemetry
   system, with multiple antennae, was installed along the louvre array to
   assist in identification of problem areas where fish were bypassing the
   louvre. Integration of DSP results with hydraulic monitoring suggested
   fish loss was associated with hydraulic turbulence and irregularities in
   the guidance velocities. In 1999, a `to scale' physical model of the
   power canal, louvre and bypass system was constructed at a hydraulic
   laboratory to evaluate structural and operational improvements to the
   system. Field results and hydraulic scale modelling resulted in changes
   to the canal, louvre angle and bypass entrance, prior to operation in
   1999 and 2000. Subsequent monitoring of smolt out-migration in 1999,
   2000 and 2001 indicated substantial improvement in unadjusted FGEs to
   54.0, 65.3, and 73.3\%, respectively. The paper demonstrates application
   of the results of detailed monitoring studies, including use of
   sophisticated telemetry and laboratory hydraulic modelling, for
   evaluation and optimization of effectiveness of a fish protection
   system. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific crossing of the African indigenous rice Oryza glaberrima
   with Oryza sativa cultivars is hindered by crossing barriers causing
   100\% spikelet sterility in F, hybrids. Since hybrids are partially
   female fertile, fertility can be restored by back crossing (BC) to a
   recurrent male parent. Distinct genetic models on spikelet sterility
   have been developed predicting, e.g., the existence of a gamete
   eliminator and/or a pollen killer. Linkage of sterility to the waxy
   starch synthase gene and the chromogen gene C, both located on
   chromosome 6, have been demonstrated. We selected a segregating BC2F3
   population of semi-sterile O. glaberrima x O. sativa indica hybrid
   progenies for analyses with PCR markers located at the respective
   chromosome-6 region. These analyses revealed that semi-sterile plants
   were heterozygous for a marker (OSR25) located in the waxy promoter,
   whereas fertile progenies were homozygous for the O. glaberrima allele.
   Adjacent markers showed no linkage to spikelet sterility. Semi-sterility
   of hybrid progenies was maintained at least until the F-4 progeny
   generation, suggesting the existence of a pollen killer in this plant
   material. Monitoring of reproductive plant development showed that
   spikelet sterility was at least partially due to an arrest of pollen
   development at the microspore stage. In order to address the question
   whether genes responsible for F-1 sterility in intraspecific hybrids (O.
   sativa indica x japonica) also cause spikelet sterility in interspecific
   hybrids, crossings with wide compatibility varieties (WCV) were
   performed. WCV accessions possess ``neutral{''} S-loci (S-n) improving
   fertility in intraspecific hybrids. This experiment showed that the
   tested S-n-loci had no fertility restoring effect in F, interspecific
   hybrids. Pollen development was completely arrested at the microspore
   stage and grains were never obtained after selfing. This suggests that
   distinct or additional S-loci are responsible for sterility of O.
   glaberrima x O. sativa hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{Potential fecal contamination of sand in the wave-washed zone of public
   bathing beaches is overlooked in beach monitoring programs. Activity in
   this zone can bring pathogens to the sand surface or into the water,
   presenting a health risk to sensitive populations. On a unit weight
   basis (colony forming units per 100g), the mean summer abundance of the
   fecal indicator bacteria enterococci and Escherichia coli was 3-38 times
   higher in the top 20 cm of wet-sand cores than in the water column at
   six freshwater bathing beaches. E coli were 4 times more abundant than
   enterococci in water but counts were similar in the sand. A correlation
   (r = 0.60) existed between E coli counts in the water and in the top 5
   cm of sand only, whereas no relationship existed between enterococci
   abundance in water and sand. In general, enterococci were most numerous
   in the 5-10 cm sand stratum and E coli in the 0-5 cm stratum. These
   preliminary data show that wet freshwater beach sand is a reservoir of
   fecal indicator bacteria. Enteric pathogens may also be present in beach
   sand. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal emergence characteristics and seedbank ecology of annual
   bluegrass were evaluated in a vegetable field in the central coast of
   California. The emergence and germinability of annual bluegrass were
   monitored continuously for over 3 yr to detect seasonal variation in
   weed emergence. Weed emergence and seedbank densities were measured
   every 45 d for 41 mo. Weed emergence was monitored simultaneously in the
   field and in a growth chamber that was adjusted seasonally for day
   length and temperature. Samples were incubated in the growth chamber for
   45 d and then elutriated to measure remaining viable ungerminated
   caryopses and relative germination potential. Seedbank densities ranged
   from 2,000 to 20,000 caryopses m(-2) during the study period. Weed
   emergence and germinability were highest from October to November and
   lowest from March to July. Emergence from soils collected in the spring
   and fall and incubated under both spring and fall conditions in the
   growth chamber indicated that seed dormancy state determines
   germinability rather than environmental conditions during incubation.
   Soil samples collected in the spring had no emergence (< 1\%) when
   incubated under spring or fall conditions, whereas samples collected in
   the fall had high emergence (> 95\%) under both spring and fall
   conditions. A waveform regression fit the repeated emergence pattern
   with a cycle length of 364 d (365 d for the growth chamber). This model
   predicted that weed emergence would peak on November 5 and be lowest on
   June 20. A survey of organic vegetable fields found that caryopses were
   more common in soils with higher clay content than in lighter soils (R-2
   = 0.77, P = 0.02). Our data suggest that annual bluegrass is more likely
   to emerge when the soil is wet during winter. The timing and location of
   annual bluegrass emergence may increase the probability of reproductive
   success during periods when seasonal rains and wet conditions limit
   tillage, weeding activities, and competition with other weeds.}},

Pages = {{663-684}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers (SWANCC), the U.S. Supreme Court held that isolated,
   intrastate, non-navigable waters could not be protected under the Clean
   Water Act based solely on their use by migratory birds. The SWANCC
   decision has created a need to compile and make available scientific
   information for post-SWANCC policy development. In response, this
   article reviews the state of our scientific understanding of isolated
   wetlands, based on the major findings of papers contributed to this
   special issue of Wetlands. Because the term ``isolated wetland{''} has
   not been used consistently in the scientific literature, we recommend
   that geographically isolated wetlands be defined as ``wetlands that are
   completely surrounded by upland,{''} as proposed by Tiner, for the
   purposes of scientific studies. Geographically isolated wetlands are not
   homogeneous but have a broad range of functional response, partly due to
   their occurrence over a wide range of climatic and geologic settings.
   One major question addressed through this special issue is the role that
   isolation plays in the function of geographically isolated wetlands. It
   appears that isolation is not a primary factor and that many of the
   functions performed by isolated wetlands are also performed by
   non-isolated wetlands and non-wetland ecosystems. Variability in
   moisture conditions plays an important role in the function of many
   geographically isolated wetlands. However, hydrologic isolation may
   affect moisture conditions, and biotic isolation could be important for
   certain populations. Depending on the factor being considered,
   geographically isolated wetlands are not entirely isolated but are
   better viewed as occurring within an isolation-connectivity continuum
   that has both hydrologic and biotic expressions. The juxtaposition of
   isolation and connectivity occurring in geographically isolated wetlands
   may represent a semi-isolated state that uniquely shapes these wetlands
   and their functions. Comprehensive data, designating the number, total
   area, and functional classification of isolated wetlands, would provide
   the foundation for monitoring impacts to isolated wetlands. Studies are
   needed to examine and quantify how isolated wetlands, wetland complexes,
   and other potentially impacted waters contribute hydrologically,
   chemically, and biologically to waters of the U.S. Methods to assess and
   map the degree of connectivity between geographically isolated wetlands
   and waters of the U.S., based on ground-water travel time, recurrence
   frequency of intermittent surface-water connections, and home ranges of
   species that require both types of waters, could be useful for
   regulators. Whatever policies are developed, scientific input and
   technical information will continue to play a crucial role in the policy
   and regulatory arena. Maintaining and enhancing the dialogue among
   wetland scientists, policy-makers, and regulators will ensure that
   critical information is developed and communicated and also continue to
   invigorate wetland science.}},

Abstract = {{The Michigan Frog and Toad Survey (MFTS) is an annual volunteer-based
   anuran census. One major concern with data collected by volunteers is
   the information's quality and consistency. The goal of this study was to
   evaluate the effect of observer experience on data quality.
   Questionnaires and an audio CD with a simulated anuran survey route were
   mailed to all active volunteers. We were able to determine volunteer
   demographics and commitment to program; species characteristically
   missed, misidentified, over- or underestimated; and influence of
   volunteer background on data quality. Volunteers were reasonably
   reliable in their abilities to determine species presence, but there was
   extensive variability in abundance estimation. Some species were
   characteristically confused by volunteers, and additional species
   frequently were recorded even when absent from a site. Prior experience
   and background had little influence on the ability to identify or
   estimate abundance of calling anurans. Our results indicate that such
   survey approaches are easy for volunteers to learn and provide
   reasonable estimates for species' presence, but do not necessarily
   estimate abundance well. These results will be used to improve
   data-collection protocols for the MFTS and better analyze and interpret
   data collected, and also could be beneficial for other regional
   amphibian monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Hutto and Young (2002) advocate an approach for regional-scale landbird
   monitoring that is based on convenience sampling and index values. We
   take issue with their methods and argue that convenience sampling and
   index values do not provide credible data from which to make inference
   about population dynamics. We clarify misconceptions of distance
   sampling from Hutto and Young used to dismiss the utility of the method.
   instead we propose that monitoring programs must address the issues of
   variable detectability and sound survey design, emphasizing rigor in all
   steps of the planning process.}},

Abstract = {{Fusarium semitectum, which occurs frequently among the fungal microflora
   associated with seedling disease of cotton, was examined using
   traditional mycological characteristics and molecular methods. The 29
   Fusarium semitectum isolates from different cotton-producing areas and
   different host genotypes in Egypt could be divided undoubtedly into five
   groups based on cultural characteristics or DNA fingerprinting methods.
   The isolates showed a high level of variability in aerial mycelia
   growth, mycelia colour and radial mycelia growth (colony diameter) on
   potato dextrose agar. The intra-specific genomic relatedness of F.
   semitectum isolates was detected by AFLP and RAPD-PCR fingerprinting
   methods and no particular difference was found between the results with
   the two fingerprint techniques.
   Five genomic groups were obtained with both RAPD-PCR and AFLP
   techniques. A good correlation of the five genomics groups and cultural
   characteristics were found, but no correlation between the results of
   the genetic analysis with the host genotype and geographic origin could
   be observed. The results indicate the utility of RAPD-PCR and AFLP for
   identifying and monitoring intra-specific genetic variability for E
   semitectum isolates.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer demand for fish and shellfish has led to an increase in aquatic
   species movement for aquaculture purposes. One potential drawback to the
   successful transplantation of animals for aquaculture is unpredictable
   performance due to local adaptation effects. This study used a common
   environment experiment to examine the potential for local adaptation in
   Mytilus trossulus (Lamark) on the cast coast of Vancouver Island,
   British Columbia (BC). Newly settled mussels were collected from two
   sites, Chemainus and Quadra Island (approximately 150 km apart), reared
   in cages at the Quadra collection site, and mortality and shell length
   were monitored. Mussels were cage-reared for 384 days with an overall
   survival of 59\% (Quadra) and 39\% (Chemainus). The Quadra mussels were
   initially smaller (5.07 mm) than the Chemainus mussels (5.90 mm), but
   the two were similar at the end of the experiment (23.5 and 23.6 mm).
   Transplanted mussels had a significantly higher mortality over the
   course of the experiment, primarily due to a severe episode in the early
   summer, and had significantly lower relative growth rates at three of 11
   measurement dates. Overall, the local mussels performed better than the
   transplanted mussels. This study demonstrates the potential for local
   adaptation effects between populations of mussels separated by only a
   relatively small geographic distance.}},

Abstract = {{The transmission of Perkinsus marinus in eastern oysters Crassostrea
   virginica in relation to water temperature, host oyster mortality, and
   water-column abundance of anti-P. marinus antibody-labeled cells was
   systematically examined for 20 mo at a site in the lower York River,
   Virginia, USA. Uninfected sentinel oysters were naturally exposed to the
   parasite at 2 wk intervals throughout the course of the study to
   determine the periodicity and rates of parasite transmission. The timing
   and magnitude of disease-associated oyster mortalities in a local P.
   marinus-infected oyster population were estimated by monitoring a
   captive subset of the local oyster population. Flow cytometric
   immunodetection methods were employed to estimate the abundance of P.
   marinus cells in water samples collected 3 times each week. The
   acquisition of P. marinus infections by naive sentinel oysters occurred
   sporadically at all times of the year; however, the highest incidence of
   infection occurred during the months of August and September. This
   window of maximum parasite transmission coincided with the death of
   infected hosts within the captive local oyster population. Counts of
   antibody-labeled cells ranged from 10 to 11900 cells l(-1), with the
   highest abundances in July and August coincident with maximum summer
   temperatures. A statistically significant relationship between
   water-column parasite abundance and infection-acquisition rate was not
   observed; however, highest parasite-transmission rates in both years
   occurred during periods of elevated water-column abundance of parasite
   cells. These results support the prevailing model of R marinus
   transmission dynamics by which maximum transmission rates are observed
   during periods of maximum P. marinus-associated host mortality. However,
   our results also indicate that transmission can occur when host
   mortality is low or absent, so alternative mortality-independent
   dissemination mechanisms are likely. The results also suggest that
   atypically early-summer oyster mortality from Haplosporidium nelsoni
   infection, at a time when infections of P. marinus are light, has a
   significant indirect influence on P. marinus transmission dynamics.
   Elimination of these hosts prior to late-summer R marinus
   infection-intensification effectively reduces the overall number of P.
   marinus cells disseminated.}},

Abstract = {{The southeastern United States (SE-US) has undergone one of the highest
   rates of landscape changes in the country due to changing demographics
   and land use practices over the last few decades. Increasing evidence
   indicates that these changes have impacted mesoscale weather patterns,
   biodiversity and water resources. Since the Southeast has one of the
   highest rates of land productivity in the nation, it is important to
   monitor the effects of such changes regularly. Here, we propose a remote
   sensing based methodology to estimate regional impacts of urban land
   development on ecosystem structure and function. As an indicator of
   ecosystem functioning, we chose net primary productivity (NPP), which is
   now routinely estimated from the MODerate resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We used the MODIS data, a 1992
   Landsat-based land cover map and nighttime data derived from the Defense
   Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System
   (DMSP/OLS) for the years 1992/1993 and 2000 to estimate the extent of
   urban development and its impact on NPP. The analysis based on the
   nighttime data indicated that in 1992/1993, urban areas amounted to
   4.5\% of the total land surface of the region. In the year 2000, the
   nighttime data showed an increase in urban development for the
   southeastern United States of 1.9\%. Estimates derived from the MODIS
   data indicated that land cover changes due to urban development that
   took place during the 1992-2000 period reduced annual NPP of the
   southeastern United States by 0.4\%. Despite the uncertainties in sensor
   fusion and the coarse resolution of the data used in this study, results
   show that the combination of MODIS products such as NPP with nighttime
   data could provide rapid assessment of urban land cover changes and
   their impacts on regional ecosystem resources. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Forest dynamics and ungulate herbivory: from leaf to landscape}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{181}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Due primarily to anthropogenic influences such as land use change,
   exotic species introductions, livestock grazing, altered hunting
   regimes, and predator control, wild ungulate populations have undergone
   tremendous shifts in recent decades. Although the result has been
   endangerment or extirpation in some regions, ungulate numbers have
   increased to locally or regionally high levels in other areas, causing
   shifts in plant species composition, problems for forest regeneration,
   and conflict with humans and domestic livestock. Our ability to find
   solutions to these problems is limited because we lack sufficient
   understanding of how ungulate species interact with predators, habitat,
   forage, competing species, and humans at multiple scales from small
   foraging patches to large regions.
   To bring together new findings in this area, encompassing various scales
   and foci of investigation, an international conference on ``Forest
   Dynamics and Ungulate Herbivory{''} was held from 3 to 6 October 2001 in
   Davos, Switzerland. We provide a synthetic overview of the papers
   contained in this Special Issue, arising from that conference. A
   companion Special Issue of the Journal for Nature Conservation is
   devoted to the more management-oriented aspects of forest-ungulate
   interactions, entitled ``Forest-Ungulate Interactions: Monitoring,
   Modeling and Management.{''}
   From the papers in this issue, a number of important generalizations
   emerge to guide our understanding and further research. Our predictive
   understanding of foraging ecology needs to be generalized and scaled up,
   if it is to become useful for predicting the consequences of herbivory
   for broad-scale vegetation dynamics. Further, it is important to move
   beyond single-factor studies, to embrace the complexity of
   ungulate-vegetation interactions. The direction and magnitude of
   ungulate influences can be difficult to gauge because of complex
   interactions among species, structural units of vegetation or
   landscapes, ecosystem processes, and natural disturbances. Researchers
   need to look beyond the simplistic concept of ``game damage{''}, and
   comprehensively address the direct and indirect effects of ungulates on
   communities, ecosystems and landscapes. This may require a more
   systems-oriented, and less species-oriented approach.
   Ungulate-vegetation interactions need to be better understood over
   multiple scales, and particularly at the coarser scales that are of
   interest to managers and policy-makers. Finally, a long-term view of
   ungulate-vegetation interactions, where past, present, and future
   effects are considered in their appropriate temporal context, is
   absolutely essential. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Forest ungulates affect woody plant species in many ways, e.g. by
   removing shoots and leaves, stripping bark, fraying, trampling,
   defecation and urination. High densities of ungulates can have a
   profound impact on plant populations, forest structure and ecosystem
   processes. We focus here on plant responses at two levels of population
   organisation in woody plants: modules and genets. Modules are defined as
   leaves and winter shoots, and genets as the original zygotes. Our main
   concern is with boreal and temperate deciduous forests, but examples
   from other systems are included where appropriate.
   Our aims are: (1) to describe and evaluate the effect of ungulate
   browsers on the number and other characteristics of plant population
   units (modules and genets), and (2) to identify consequences of the
   resulting changes in module and genet populations for woody plants, the
   browser and the forest ecosystems.
   At the module level, the ungulate browsers can easily change not only
   the number, but also the size and quality of modules. The browser-module
   system is more dynamic than we commonly believe, and there is a strong
   seasonal effect of browsing. At medium to high ungulate densities we can
   expect different food selection processes and food intake rates of
   ungulates compared to those found at low densities.
   At the genet level, browsers affect the number of genets of preferred
   plant species, as well as their size and other qualities. Reductions in
   the abundance of one plant species can lead to increases in other
   species, followed by cascading effects involving many different biota.
   If species increasing in abundance differ in important respects from
   those being replaced (e.g. if nitrogen-fixing or deciduous trees replace
   non-fixing or coniferous species, respectively) there may be dramatic
   long-term changes in ecosystem function.
   Both module and genet populations respond to ungulate activities, but
   over somewhat different time scales: the module responses being more
   short-term, with apparently more dynamic components. We need to better
   understand the dynamics of trees at both the module and genet levels,
   especially at high ungulate densities, and to monitor the responses of
   the woody plants as well as the ungulates. A better understanding of the
   interactions between population dynamics of ungulates and woody plants
   is also required. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Socioecological models for small mammals attempt to explain the causal
   relations between the spatiotemporal distributions of food resources,
   females and males. We tested their predictions for a wild population of
   Cavia magna, a grazing, precocial rodent, by analysing spacing behaviour
   in relation to various demographic features. Between May 1999 and
   January 2001 we collected capture-recapture data on 309 individuals and
   monitored 55 females and 49 males by radiotelemetry in periodically
   inundated wetland in Uruguay. Cavies showed a nonstationary use of
   space: monthly home ranges drifted over the whole study site. Female
   home ranges overlapped with those of several others. Females were
   randomly distributed and we found no evidence for socially mediated
   reproductive synchrony. Males ranged over larger areas than females,
   showing even less site fidelity, and also overlapped with several
   rivals. This basic spacing system remained stable over a wide range of
   densities and sex ratios. Independent of sex, animals used overlap zones
   randomly with respect to each other. Significant dynamic
   (spatiotemporal) interaction was most frequent between males and
   females. However, interaction analyses revealed no evidence for stable
   social bonds between animals, regardless of sex. We suggest that
   unpredictable female locations prevent males monopolizing females
   spatially. Because females are solitary, males could monopolize only one
   female by maintaining close proximity, rendering a roaming mating tactic
   more successful. Our findings point to a solitary `social' system and
   overlap promiscuity as the likely mating system for the C. magna
   population studied. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The

Abstract = {{For small mammals that are vulnerable to predation, the protection
   provided by physical structuring within the habitat is important in
   determining suitable nest or resting sites but little is known about how
   different aspects of structure affect use of the habitat more generally.
   We examined the effects of ground-level structure (open/complex),
   overhead cover (present/absent) and the distribution of protected nest
   sites and food (clumped together/scattered) on activity and use of space
   among house mice, Mus domesticus, in enclosures. Adult pairs were housed
   in eight habitat types differing in arrangement of nestboxes, bricks and
   cover sheets, and their location was monitored under infrared light
   every 0.5 s over 4 h during the dark period. The mice spent much more
   time within protected nest sites and were more restricted in use of
   different sites within habitats that had little ground-level structure
   and no overhead cover. Much wider use was made of structurally complex
   habitats. Complex ground-level structure had the greatest impact on
   emergence from protected nest sites and use of space, since mice
   preferred to stay close to, or on top of, walls and other objects when
   undisturbed. The influence of overhead cover on normal activity depended
   on the extent of ground-level structure and origin of the mice, but,
   when disturbed by an experimenter, mice sheltered under overhead cover
   or in enclosed nest sites. Preference between nest sites depended on
   accessibility from under overhead cover and proximity to enclosure
   walls. We found almost no sex differences in activity or use of space.

Abstract = {{Eastern collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris collaris) on the Ozark
   Plateau of southern Missouri are restricted to islands of rocky glade
   habitat located throughout the oak-hickory forests of the region. Human
   mediated suppression of fire negatively impacts collared lizard
   populations by permitting the overgrowth and consequent disappearance of
   this glade habitat and also leads to a dense forest understorey that
   impedes movement of lizards between glades. We present data examining
   the effects of a fire management regime on collared lizard populations
   we monitored via mark/recapture from 1998 to 2001. We demonstrate
   increased glade-to-glade dispersal, colonization of previously
   unoccupied glades, and a significant increase in population size in the
   burned area. In addition, we show that populations within burned areas
   exhibit body sizes similar to those reported for populations living on
   healthy habitat as compared to those living on habitat that has
   deteriorated because of fire suppression. We conclude that managed
   forest fires positively impact collared lizard populations in the
   Ozarks, promoting factors that increase the long-term sustainability of
   the species.}},

Abstract = {{The development and evaluation of time-resolved (minutes) measurement
   technologies to characterize the physical and chemical make up of
   ambient aerosols/particulate matter in the atmosphere are essential to
   our improved understanding of aerosol process science, source
   attribution, and population exposure. During the PMTACS-NY summer 2001
   campaign in Queens/New York, a wide variety of on-line aerosol analysis
   instruments were deployed together with gas-phase and filter sampling
   techniques. Here, we report on the intercomparison of four
   semi-continuous PM2.5 sulfate instruments and evaluation of these
   instruments with one set of 6h and three sets of 24-h filter
   measurements, collected at the same site. The semi-continuous
   instruments were an aerosol mass spectrometer, a particle-into-liquid
   sampler coupled with ion chromatograph, a Rupprecht \& Patashnick
   Sulfate Monitor (R\&P 8400S), and a continuous sulfate monitor developed
   by George Allen at Harvard School of Public Health and built in the
   field by one of us (J.J.S.). We found an excellent almost one-to-one
   correlation between the four semi-continuous instruments with typical
   multiple R-squared values >0.9. In addition, the correlations of the
   semi-continuous data with the filter measurements are also highly linear
   (R-2 0.86-0.98) but the semi-continuous instruments recover only about
   85\% of the sulfate mass collected by the filter techniques. The most
   likely explanation for this deviation is a combination of positive
   sampling artifacts on the filters (collection of particles with diameter
   greater then 2.5 mum, oxidation/condensation processes on the filters)
   with negative biases of the semi-continuous measurements (inlet line
   losses, limited collection efficiency for small particles below ca. 0.1
   mum). (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The intake fraction is defined for a specific species and emission
   source as the ratio of attributable population intake to total
   emissions. Focusing on California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) as a
   case study, we combine ambient monitoring data with time-activity
   patterns to estimate the population intake of carbon monoxide and
   benzene emitted from motor vehicles during 1996-1999. In addition to
   exposures to ambient concentrations, three microenvironments are
   considered in which the exposure concentration of motor vehicle
   emissions is higher than in ambient air: in and near vehicles, inside a
   building that is near a freeway, and inside a residence with an attached
   garage. Incorporating data on motor vehicle emissions estimated by the
   EMFAC2000 model, we estimate that the 15 million people in the SoCAB
   inhale 0.003-0.009\% (34 85 per million, with a best estimate of 47 per
   million) of primary, nonreactive compounds emitted into the basin by
   motor vehicles. This population intake of primary motor vehicle
   emissions is approximately 50\% higher than the average ambient
   concentration times the average breathing rate, owing to higher
   concentrations in the three microenviromments and also to the temporal
   and spatial correlation among breathing rates, concentrations, and
   population densities. The approach demonstrated here can inform policy
   decisions requiring a metric of population exposure to airborne
   pollutants. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainable use of wildlife resources within community-based
   programmes is considered as a valuable option to enhance development and
   conservation objectives. The application of such a concept in communal
   lands requires the strong support of local communities through their
   active involvement in wildlife management. Precise and regular
   information on wildlife abundance is also essential for effective
   conservation. In this paper, we present an innovative participatory
   monitoring method based on bicycle counts developed within the framework
   of an integrated conservation and development project in the Zambezi
   Valley, Zimbabwe. Results from the 1999 count of population density and
   structure of common species as well as diversity of large to medium size
   species are presented. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method,
   which allowed a high census intensity with efficient animal detection,
   and hence appeared appropriate for use in a non-protected area. The
   method gave high levels of precision for the density estimates obtained
   (10-30\% cv) and is therefore useful as a repeatable monitoring tool. In
   addition, this method is inexpensive to run and is easy to implement for
   local people. We emphasise the technical and financial autonomy offered
   by the bicycle counts for communities to monitor their wildlife
   resources, and we discuss the contribution of this method to the
   wildlife management process.}},

Abstract = {{Great Britain's wintering coastal wader populations have been estimated
   for the period 1994/1995-1998/1999 from data provided from two sources:
   the Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) and the Non-estuarine Coastal Waterfowl
   Survey (UK-NEWS). New methodology for estimating the number of wintering
   waders is applied. It imputes (fills in) the value of missing counts
   before estimating the population size of each species as being the mean
   of the largest annual count made between November and March over the
   relevant 5-year period. This methodology has led to an 11\% larger
   estimate of the number of waders present on Great Britain's coasts than
   the traditional approach based on averaging just January counts over a
   5-year period, and it suggests that Great Britain's coastline supports
   ca.2.1 million waders. Updated values are presented from which site
   evaluations based on 1\% of the national population can be derived.
   Great Britain is of considerable international importance for waders. It
   holds > 25 and > 50\% of the flyway populations of nine and four species
   of wader, respectively, but for the first time since the start of
   monitoring in the early 1970s, the historical increase in the number of
   predominantly coastal waders wintering in Great Britain is coming to an
   end. Seven of the 14 species that have shown population changes of > 5\%
   since the last set of 1987/1988-1991/1992 population estimates have
   declined in numbers. The possible causes of the fluctuations in wader
   populations, such as climate change and changing nutrient inputs to
   coastal waters are discussed. There is an urgent need to identify the
   causative factors leading to these declines, and to use the new
   population estimates to identify new sites that should be afforded legal
   protection, an action that should help Great Britain maintain its
   internationally important wader populations. The decrease in the updated
   population estimate of Eurasian oystercatcher, for example, has made it
   possible to determine that 19 rather than 17 sites in Great Britain are
   worthy of statutory protection on the basis of holding 1\% or more of
   its national population. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Monitoring is essential to evaluate the success of translocations, but
   is frequently neglected. One exception has been the reinforcement of the
   otter (Lutra lutra) population in the Derwent and Esk catchments in
   North East England, UK, between 1990 and 1993. Here, we use data on
   otter sprainting activity collected before, during and after
   translocations to identify relationships with vegetation, food resources
   and physical river characteristics. Sprainting activity increased
   significantly with trout density, stream order, and surrounding cover by
   woodland and semi-natural grassland vegetation, and decreased
   significantly with stream gradient. The form of these relationships was
   unimodal, sprainting activity peaking at intermediate levels of
   environmental variables. A logistic regression model including variables
   relating to fish density, the physical characteristics of the river and
   surrounding vegetation cover was able to predict the presence or absence
   of otter sprainting at different survey sites with an accuracy of 92\%.
   Fish density and the physical characteristics of the river were the most
   important factors in the model. Models such as this are of practical use
   for assessing the likely success of future otter translocations, both in
   North East England and other regions of the UK and Europe. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Albatross movements and foraging grounds during the post-breeding
   dispersal are poorly understood, despite their important conservation
   implications. We tracked four female black-footed albatrosses
   (Phoebastria nigripes) for 100 days during their summer (July-September,
   1997-1999) post-breeding dispersal off California, and compared their
   movements to the distribution of fishing effort from the Japanese
   Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) longline fishery. The tracked birds foraged
   largely along the transition zone between the California Current and the
   Central Pacific Gyre, and spent 25, 24, and 51\% of their time at sea
   within the 200-mile exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the USA and
   Mexico, and the high seas (international waters) respectively. The
   satellite-tracked birds occupied subtropical waters (18-20 degreesC)
   targeted by longline fisheries for tuna (Thunnus spp.) and broad-bill
   swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and ranged disproportionately farther
   during daylight hours, when tuna fisheries operate. The available data
   suggest that albatrosses overlap temporally and spatially with longline
   fisheries in the northeast Pacific Ocean. However, this research cannot
   directly evaluate whether black-footed albatross bycatch occurs in these
   fisheries. The coarse temporal (monthly) and spatial (1degrees x
   1degrees) resolution of the fisheries data, and the dynamic nature of
   the fishing effort inhibited a fine-scale analysis of albatross overlap
   with longline fisheries. While we documented substantial spatial overlap
   between albatross distributions and the Japanese EPO longline fishing
   effort during the 1980s, we found no co-occurrence during the 1990s.
   This study illustrates the value of satellite telemetry to assess
   national conservation responsibilities, and to identify potential
   interactions of protected species with fisheries not currently monitored
   by observer programs. Furthermore, our results underscore the need to
   exercise caution when interpreting satellite telemetry data for
   conservation purposes, because of the highly dynamic nature of pelagic
   fisheries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied survival and demography of black bears, Ursus americanus, in
   Banff National Park (BNP) from 1994 to 2000 to test the efficacy of
   National Park protection. We monitored 25 radiocollared bears an average
   of 1.9 years each for a total of 51.8 bear-years. Eighty-two percent of
   all mortality (n = 11) was human-caused, composed of highway mortality
   (36\%), management mortality (27\%) and management relocation (18\%).
   Survival was influenced by season and management status. Once bears
   became a management problem, survival (0.66) was lower than several
   hunted populations. Adult (0.84) survival was comparable to other
   unprotected or partly protected populations. Cub (0.64) and yearling
   (0.67) survival, and reproductive rate (m(x) = 0.47 female
   cubs/inter-birth interval), was slightly lower than other populations in
   western North America. We combined survival and reproductive rates in a
   preliminary post-birth pulse age-class Leslie matrix model and estimated
   population growth rate as 0.95 (95\% simulated C.I. 0.79-1.10).
   Sensitivity analyses showed X was most sensitive to changes in adult
   female survival. Responsible management agencies should reduce adult
   female highway mortality and the likelihood of becoming a management
   problem, while continuing monitoring to refine demographic analyses to
   adequately protect this population. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We tested predictions associated with three widely used hypotheses for
   facultative sex-ratio adjustment of vertebrates using eight enclosed
   populations of gray-tailed voles, Microtus canicaudus. These were (i)
   the population sex ratio hypothesis, which predicts that recruitment sex
   ratios should oppose adult sex-ratio skews, (ii) the local resource
   competition hypothesis, which predicts female-biased recruitment at low
   adult population density and male-biased recruitment at high population
   density, and (iii) the first cohort advantage hypothesis, which predicts
   that recruitment sex ratios should be female biased in the spring and
   male biased in the autumn. We monitored naturally increasing population
   densities with approximately equal adult sex ratios through the spring
   and summer and manipulated adult sex ratios in the autumn and measured
   subsequent sex ratios of recruits. We did not observe any significant
   sex-ratio adjustment in response to adult sex ratio or high population
   density; we did detect an influence of time within the breeding season,
   with more female offspring observed in the spring and more male
   offspring observed in the autumn. Significant seasonal increases in
   recruitment sex ratios indicate the capacity of female gray-tailed voles
   to manipulate their offspring sex ratios and suggest seasonal variation
   in the relative reproductive value of male and female offspring to be a
   regular phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Trained observers counted migrating raptors and vultures from ridgetops
   at six sites in the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain Flyways of western
   North America: Goshute Mountains, Nevada (autumn 1983-2001); Wellsville
   Mountains, Utah (autumn 1977-1979 and 1987-2001); Bridger Mountains,
   Montana (autumn 1992-2001); Manzano Mountains, New Mexico (autumn
   1985-2001); Sandia Mountains, New Mexico (spring 1985-2001); and Lipan
   Point, Arizona (autumn 1991-2001). We analyzed site-specific trends in
   annual passage rates (raptors per 100 hr of observation), conducting
   species-level analyses for 13 species and age-specific analyses for
   Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) and Golden Eagles (Aquila
   chrysaetos). Our findings suggest that, until the late 1990s when
   possibly drought-related downturns began, Intermountain-Rocky Mountain
   populations of Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura), Ospreys (Pandion
   haliaetus), Broad-winged Hawks (Buteo platypterus), Red-tailed Hawks (B.
   jamaicensis), Merlins (Falco columbarius), and Peregrine Falcons (F.
   peregrinus) were increasing for diverse reasons. In contrast, our
   migration data and other sources indicate concern over the status of
   western Golden Eagles and Ferruginous Hawks (B. regalis), and
   uncertainty about the status of western Northern Goshawks and American
   Kestrels (F. sparverius). Breeding Bird Survey and Christmas Bird Count
   trends generally corroborated our results. The migration data reveal
   regional variation in the status of some species, give new insight
   concerning Golden Eagle and Northern Goshawk migrations, and suggest
   effects of an ongoing, widespread drought. Our analyses demonstrate the
   value of standardized, long-term migration counts for monitoring the
   regional status and trends of migratory raptors in western North
   America.}},

Abstract = {{The Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross (Thalassarche chlororhynchos) breeds
   only at the Tristan da Cunha archipelago and Gough Island in the central
   South Atlantic Ocean, and is threatened by mortality from longline
   fisheries operating in the South Atlantic. Demographic data have been
   collected from two study colonies on Gough Island and Tristan da Cunha
   for 20 years. Annual variation in the number of breeding birds was
   strongly correlated between the two islands, and over the whole study
   period both study populations have trended downward at around 1.2\% per
   year. The number of established breeders on Gough Island has declined
   more rapidly, and significantly, at an annual rate of 2.3\%. Monitoring
   established breeders may be a sensitive means of detecting population
   trends. Average breeding success (67-69\%) and breeding frequency
   (66-65\%) were very similar on the two islands. On Gough Island immature
   and adult annual apparent survival averaged 88 +/- 3\% and 92 +/- 1\%,
   respectively, and apparent survival from fledging to age 5 has averaged
   31 +/- 8\%. Apparent adult survival on Tristan da Cunha averaged only 84
   +/- 2\%. Annual survival of Tristan birds was negatively correlated with
   longline fishing effort in the South Atlantic Ocean. Population modeling
   predicts annual rates of decrease of 1.5-2.8\% on Gough Island and 5.5\%
   on Tristan da Cunha. Comparison with congeners suggests that the
   observed and predicted decreases are most likely to be caused by low
   adult and immature survival. The conservation status of Atlantic
   Yellow-nosed Albatrosses should be changed from Near Threatened to
   Endangered.}},

Abstract = {{The Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network has been monitoring turtle
   strandings for more than 20 years in the United States. High numbers of
   strandings in the early to mid-1980s prompted regulations to require
   turtle excluder devices (TEDs) on shrimping vessels (trawlers).
   Following year-round TED implementation in 1991, however, stranding
   levels in the Gulf of Mexico increased. We evaluated the efficacy of
   TEDs and other management actions (e.g., fisheries closures) on
   loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempii)
   turtle populations by analyzing a long-term, stranding data set from the
   western Gulf of Mexico. Our analyses suggest that both sea turtle
   population growth and shrimping activity have contributed to the
   observed increase in strandings. Compliance with regulations requiring
   turtle excluder devices was a significant factor in accounting for
   annual stranding variability: low compliance was correlated with high
   levels of strandings. Our projections suggest that improved compliance
   with TED regulations will reduce strandings to levels that, in
   conjunction with other protective measures, should promote population
   recoveries for loggerhead and Kemp's ridley turtles. Local, seasonal
   fisheries closures, concurrent with TED enforcement, could reduce
   strandings to even lower levels. A seasonal closure adjacent to a
   recently established Kemp's ridley nesting beach may also reduce
   mortality of nesting adults and thus promote long-term population
   persistence by fostering the establishment of a robust secondary nesting
   site.}},

Abstract = {{Animals are expected to distribute themselves in a heterogeneous
   environment in such a way that they maximize their reproductive output.
   When the environment is profoundly changed by human pressure, however,
   cues used for habitat selection in the past may no longer provide
   reliable information about habitat quality. I monitored the nesting
   success of Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) in two types of forest in
   southern Moravia in the Czech Republic. I assessed their breeding
   density and territory size using a territory mapping method and the
   minimum convex polygon method. I determined spring arrival through
   direct observations and measured vegetation characteristics and pattern
   of spring leafing of shrubs in both forests. I show that Blackcaps
   preferentially settled in a plantation of introduced black locust
   (Robinia pseudoacacia) upon their return from spring migration. In this
   plantation, they reached twice the density as that observed in a natural
   floodplain forest nearby. However, they had significantly lower nesting
   success (15.5\%) than in the floodplain forest (59\%). Returning migrant
   Blackcaps may be lured by early-leafing shrubs in the exotic plantation
   to settle earlier and at higher densities in the reproductively inferior
   habitat. My results show that (1) it is not possible to assess habitat
   quality based solely on breeding densities, (2) human-modified habitats
   can function as ecological traps by luring settling birds into
   unsuitable habitats, and (3) by replacing exotic plant species with
   native ones we can restore native communities and increase the breeding
   productivity of bird populations.}},

Abstract = {{What drives community change on large spatial scales? An opportunity to
   address this fundamental question was provided by a massive subtidal
   recruitment of the mussel, Mytilus edulis, across the southwest Gulf of
   Maine (GOM), USA, in 1995. Since M. edulis is consumed by many predator
   species, we hypothesized that the episodic increase in food resources
   had a bottom-up effect on populations of mussel consumers. The mussel
   recruitment event was unprecedented in its large spatial extent, high
   coverage of the sea floor, and depth of penetration into the rocky
   subtidal zone. During 1995-1997 we tracked mussels and their consumer
   populations in the area to document what happened. Surveys across a
   120-km marine landscape revealed that juvenile mussels covered 33-91\%
   of the bottom (8-12 m depth) at 13 of 17 sites between October 1995 and
   June 1996. The cover of mussel prey in June 1996 explained significant
   variation in the density and biomass of mussel predators, the sea stars
   Asterias spp. and rock crabs Cancer spp., at 16-17 sites 10, 13, and 23
   months after mussel recruitment. These results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that the extensive mussel recruitment had a bottom-up effect
   on the subtidal food web. Levels of Asterias spp. recruitment, biomass,
   and density following mussel recruitment were the highest recorded at
   two monitored sites in 16-18 years. One year after the large pulse of
   mussel food resources, Asterias spp. recruitment was positively related
   to the percent cover of mussels, suggesting a feedback between food
   supply and consumer recruitment on a large spatial scale. Crab
   size-structure data supported the interpretation that recruitment
   contributed to the high densities of rock crabs recorded in July 1997.
   We suggest that the bottom-up effects observed in consumer populations
   were produced by increased growth, elevated reproduction and
   recruitment, and possibly by immigration.
   Coupling between bottom-up and top-down control was observed after a lag
   of 12-14 months post-mussel recruitment when predation by sea stars,
   rock crabs, and sea urchins eliminated extensive beds of juvenile
   mussels across the study region. The elimination of Mytilus prey
   triggered cannibalism in the sea star Asterias vulgaris, which
   contributed to density-dependent population declines in sea stars
   between 1996 and 1997. A key assumption of a consumer reproduction and
   recruitment response-that some of the larvae produced by local adult
   stocks of consumers could be retained in the study region-was tested by
   investigating the potential larval dispersal of sea stars and crabs in a
   simulated three-dimensional flow field of the southwest GOM. The
   simulation supported the assumption as 15-75\% of particles released
   below 1-m depth were retained in the region over 2-5 week periods
   approximating the larval life-span of the consumers. Furthermore, the
   degree of retention increased dramatically between the surface (1 m) and
   15-m depth, implying that the extent of large-scale connectivity by
   passive larval dispersal is highly dependent on depth. In this study,
   massive prey recruitment stimulated coupling between bottom-up and
   top-down forces, resulting in broad-scale changes in local consumer
   populations that persisted after the prey-recruitment signal was
   removed, underscoring the importance of episodic events in marine
   community dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be
   defected when present: Failing to allow for the possibility that a
   target species was present, but undetected at a site will lead to biased
   estimates of site occupancy, colonization,and local extinction
   probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in
   long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a
   model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the
   probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not
   require any assumptions-of process stationarity, as do some previous
   methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in
   a-manner similar to. Pollock's robust design as used-in mark-recapture
   studies. Via simulation, we,show that the model provides good estimates
   of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method
   with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix
   occidentalis caurina) in northern California and tiger salamanders
   (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Minnesota, USA.}},

Abstract = {{Selection imposed by mating disruption could lead. to changes in the
   pest insect's chemical communication system if there is genetically
   based variation in signal and/or response characteristics. Ultimately,
   this evolution, in the absence of courteracting selection, could lead to
   resistance to this control tactic. For this reason, the effects of
   mating disruption on the reproductive success of two pheromone strains
   of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), were examined in
   field-cage experiments in which we could monitor mating success. The
   first experiment evaluated mating disruption using the major component
   of the cabbage looper pheromone {[}(Z)-7-dodecenyl acetate: Z7-12:Ac],
   and the complete pheromone blend emitted by females. The second
   experiment focused on disruption with the compound that is often most
   abundant in the pheromone blend of mutant females {[}(Z)-9-tetradecenyl
   acetate: Z9-14:Ac], and the complete pheromone blend emitted by mutant
   females. In the first experiment, mutant males tended to have greater
   mating success than normal males in the presence of the full normal
   blend, as they do in the absence of disruptants. By itself, this result
   would indicate that the mutant alleles would spread through a
   population. However, normal females had greater mating success than
   mutant females in the presence of the normal blend disruptant (and
   Z7-12:Ac). This directional selection on females would tend to counter
   the selection on males, and dampen or eliminated any change in allelic
   frequency in the next generation. In the second experiment, the full
   mutant blend decreased male and female mating frequency relative to,.
   control, but did not influence the relative mating success of the two
   strains. Results of these experiments demonstrate for the first time
   that the effects of a mating disruptant on mating success of T ni can be
   complex, with the pheromone blend having sometimes counteracting
   effects. on. pheromone strains and sexes.}},

Abstract = {{The casuarina moth, Lymantria xylina Swinhoe, is a serious defoliator of
   hardwood and fruit trees in Taiwan. Currently, overwintering egg mass
   density is the primary criterion used to monitor the population size of
   the casuarina moth. We assessed the relationship between casuarina moth
   egg mass size and the number of eggs per egg mass from two heavily
   infested sites in central Taiwan. Size parameters (length, width, area,
   and weight) were measured for each egg mass, and the egg number,in each
   egg mass was counted. Results indicated substantial geographic variation
   in egg mass size. Regression analyses revealed a positive relationship
   between mass size (length, width, area, and weight) and the number of
   eggs per mass, and that weight explains approximate to98\% of the
   variation in the number of eggs per egg mass. The use of weight and
   other egg mass density measurements may provide forest and orchard
   managers with increased accuracy in estimating casuarina moth population
   size.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to assess the location and the seasonal
   variation in physicochemical parameters of springs (outlets of
   underground water channels) of Bhetagad watershed of Uttaranchal hills,
   India. Traditionally, spring water is used for multiple purposes in this
   region. The average population density of the watershed is 366 persons
   km(-2), distributed within an altitudinal range of 1,090-2,060 m
   a.m.s.l. and 23.52 km(2) area. Twelve springs, in three different land
   uses e.g. pine forest, rainfed agriculture near settlements and
   irrigated agriculture near settlements were monitored in the winter
   (January), summer (June) and monsoon (August) during 1998 and 1999. The
   water quality parameters selected, in the present study are pH, EC, TDS,
   DO, free CO2, total hardness, Ca2+, Mg2+, CO32-, HCO3-, Cl-, NO3- and
   SO42- ions. Some springs in pine forests exhibit lower pH values than
   the permissible limit. Springs, with their location in agriculture and
   settlement, show slightly higher EC than the springs in pine forests.
   All the springs, near the irrigated agricultural land recorded higher
   nitrate ion concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Biomagnification of organochlorine compounds (pesticides and
   polychlorinated biphenyls) through the marine aquaculture food chain is
   investigated. From first-feeding, specimens of sea bass were exposed to
   commercial fish feed (that contained DDTs and PCBs residues) for ca. 24
   months, and selected tissues (white and red muscle, liver, and visceral
   fat) were analyzed after 6 and 24 months of diet exposure. Data obtained
   showed that experimental fish tissues presented a similar contamination
   pattern to that of fish feed, and biomagnification processes of these
   compounds were proved. Additionally, commercial sea bass cultured in
   farms from the western Mediterranean were analyzed, their organochlorine
   concentrations being significantly lower than those of the 24 month old
   experimental fish. Thus, the exposition of human population to Us
   through consumption of cultured fish would be lower than expected from
   experimental biomagnification studies, although red muscle presented
   similar OC levels in both cases, which were much higher than those of
   white muscle. Although levels of organochlorine compounds were found to
   be low, the persistence, ubiquity, and toxicity of these compounds,
   together with their presence in fish feed, make it necessary to monitor
   OC residues in the routine quality assurance programs of aquaculture
   activities, as this food chain is a source of these toxic compounds for
   human consumers. The development of sensitive analytical methodology
   based on GC-MS/MS has allowed for the reaching of low detection limits
   required to carry out the present study.}},

Journal = {{ESTUARIES}},

Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{866-877}},

Abstract = {{A large data set, collected under the national Danish monitoring
   program, was used to evaluate the importance of photon flux density
   (PFD), relative wave exposure (REI), littoral slope, and salinity in
   regulating eelgrass cover at different depth intervals in Danish coastal
   waters. Average eelgrass cover exhibited a bell-shaped pattern with
   depth, reflecting that different factors regulate eelgrass cover at
   shallow- and deep-water sites. The multiple logistic regression analysis
   was used to identify regulating factors and determine their role in
   relation to eelgrass cover at different depth intervals. PFD, REI, and
   salinity were main factors affecting eelgrass cover while littoral slope
   had no significant effect. Eelgrass cover increased with increasing PFD
   at water depths of more than 2 m, while cover was inversely related to
   REI in shallow water. This pattern favored eelgrass cover at
   intermediate depths where levels of PFD and REI were moderate. Salinity
   had a minor, but significant, effect on eelgrass cover that is most
   likely related to the varying costs of osmoregulation with changing
   salinity. The analysis provided a useful conceptual framework for
   understanding the factors that regulate eelgrass abundance with depth.
   Although the regression model was statistically significant and included
   the factors generally considered most important in regulating eelgrass
   cover, its explanatory power was low, especially in shallow water. The
   largest discrepancies between predicted and observed values of cover
   appeared in cases where no eelgrass occurred despite sufficient light
   and moderate levels of exposure (almost 50\% of all observations). These
   discrepancies suggest that population losses due to stochastic
   phenomena, such as extreme wind events played an important regulating
   role that is not adequately described by average exposure levels. A more
   thorough knowledge of the importance of such loss processes and the time
   scales involved in recovery of seagrass populations after a severe
   disturbance are necessary if we are to understand the regulation of
   seagrass distribution in shallow coastal areas more fully.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated sources of inter-annual variability in larval supply to
   crab and sea urchin populations at Bodega Head and Point Reyes in
   northern California. During the spring and summer upwelling seasons of
   the years 1992 through 1997 we monitored the weekly settlement rates of
   nine species of crabs and two species of sea urchins. As observed in
   previous studies, daily values of alongshore Nvindstress, temperature
   and salinity provided evidence for the poleward flow of relatively warm,
   low salinity water from south of Point Reyes, an apparent retention
   zone, during upwelling relaxation events. In years dominated by these
   events (1992, 1993, 1995 and 1996) we observed that alongshore
   windstress, temperature and salinity were coherent and temperature was
   significantly correlated with cancrid crab settlement. During these
   years the magnitude of cancrid crab settlement and the fraction of
   cancrid crabs relative to other crab species settling were high. Over
   four years of concurrent sampling there was consistently greater cancrid
   crab settlement at the Point Reyes site, within the retention zone, than
   at Bodega Head. Settlement of non-cancrid crabs (porcellanids, grapsids,
   pagurids and majids) was not as closely linked to intra-annual patterns
   of upwelling and relaxation, possibly due to the shorter seasonal
   availability of larvae allowing for the influence of fewer relaxation
   events. Settlement of this group among years was positively correlated
   with environmental indicators of strong seasonal upwelling; high
   salinity, Bakun upwelling index and low temperature. Sea urchin
   settlement events were observed in June and July of 1992, 1994 and 1997
   during warming periods when salinity and temperature were increasing and
   alongshore windstress was low. Across the six years of the study, we
   found that cancrid crab larvae had a more even seasonal availability
   than larvae of non-cancrid species, which settled in greatest numbers
   during the early portion of the upwelling season. Sea urchins settled in
   greatest numbers during the later part of the upwelling season. Together
   these patterns demonstrate the taxon-specific way that inter-annual
   variability in larval supply is forced by the coincidence of larval
   availability with favorable physical transport mechanisms. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Divergence of dispersal regimens has been suggested to be the selective
   basis for the evolutionary differentiation of agonistic phenotypes found
   in natural populations of house mice. Dispersal propensity may,
   therefore, be expected to exhibit heritable variation in wild house
   mice, ultimately related to motivational differences causing observable
   differences in agonistic behaviour. To test for heritable components in
   dispersal propensity in wild house mice, father-offspring regressions of
   dispersal latencies from residential social groups were determined in
   standardized seminatural social settings. To evaluate potential
   motivational causes of phenotypic variation in dispersal behaviour, all
   test animals (fathers, sons, and daughters) were scored prior to the
   dispersal experiment in a standardized behavioural test, at 60 d of age.
   Activities were monitored in a 1 m(2) square test arena during 10-min
   observation periods. Test arenas exhibited four equidistant openings
   leading to cages containing fresh, own, sibling, or foreign bedding
   material. The apparatus allowed for scoring anxiety, exploratory
   activity, and kin preference. Subsequently, test animals were exposed to
   a resident population in a semi-natural enclosure providing a dispersal
   opportunity. Father-son regressions of dispersal latencies were
   significantly positive, but no significant relationship was found for
   daughters. Dispersal latency decreased with increasing exploratory
   activity scores in males, but increased in females. Anxiety as well as
   kin preferences did not affect dispersal propensity. Hence sex-linked,
   motivational components reflect heritable social behaviour variation in
   male house mice that may ultimately be caused by diverging dispersal
   regimens.}},

Abstract = {{Biologists have long debated the speed, uniformity, and predictability
   of evolutionary change. However, evaluating such patterns on a
   geographic scale requires time-series data on replicate sets of natural
   populations. Drosophila subobscura has proven an ideal model system for
   such studies. This fly is broadly distributed in the Old World, but was
   introduced into both North and South America just over two decades ago
   and then spread rapidly. Rapid, uniform, and predictable evolution would
   be demonstrated if the invading flies evolved latitudinal clines that
   progressively converged on those of the native populations. Evolutionary
   geneticists quickly capitalized on this opportunity to monitor
   evolutionary dynamics. Just a few years after the introduction, they
   surveyed chromosomal inversion frequencies in both North and South
   America. On both continents they detected incipient latitudinal clines
   in chromosome inversion frequencies that almost always had the same sign
   with latitude as in the Old World. Thus the initial evolution of
   chromosomal polymorphisms on a continental scale was remarkably rapid
   and consistent. Here we report newer samples of inversion frequencies
   for the colonizing populations: the time series now spans almost one
   decade for North America and almost two decades for South America.
   Almost all inversions in the New World continue to show the same sign of
   frequency with latitude as in the Old World. Nevertheless, inversion
   clines have not consistently increased in steepness over time; nor have
   they consistently continued to converge on the Old World baseline.
   However, five arrangements in South America show directional,
   continentwide shifts in frequency. Overall, the initial consistency of
   clinal evolutionary trajectories seen in the first surveys seems not to
   have been maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins from the bacterium
   Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) grew on >62 million ha worldwide from 1996
   to 2002. Despite expectations that pests would rapidly evolve resistance
   to such Bt crops, increases in the frequency of resistance caused by
   exposure to Bt crops in the field have not yet been documented. in
   laboratory and greenhouse tests, however, at least seven resistant
   laboratory strains of three pests (Plutella xylostella {[}L.],
   Pectinophora gossypiella {[}Saunders], and Helicoverpa armigera
   {[}Hubner]) have completed development on Bt crops. In contrast, several
   other laboratory strains with 70- to 10,100-fold resistance to Bt toxins
   in diet did not survive on Bt crops. Monitoring of field populations in
   regions with high adoption of Bt crops has not yet detected increases in
   resistance frequency. Resistance monitoring examples include Ostrinia
   nubilalis (Hubner) in the United States (6 yr), P. gossypiella in
   Arizona (5 yr), H. armigera in northern China (3 yr), and Helicoverpa
   zea (Boddie) in North Carolina (2 yr). Key factors delaying resistance
   to Bt crops are probably refuges of non-Bt host plants that enable
   survival of susceptible pests, low initial resistance allele
   frequencies, recessive inheritance of resistance to Bt crops, costs
   associated with resistance that reduce fitness of resistant individuals
   relative to susceptible individuals on non-Bt hosts ({''}fitness
   costs{''}), and disadvantages suffered by resistant strains on Bt hosts
   relative to their performance on non-Bt hosts ({''}incomplete
   resistance{''}). The relative importance of these factors varies among
   pest-Bt crop systems, and violations of key assumptions of the refuge
   strategy (low resistance allele frequency and recessive inheritance) may
   occur in some cases. The success of Bt crops exceeds expectations of
   many, but does not preclude resistance problems in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of banner-tailed kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spectabilis, have
   declined sharply in some but not all populations monitored in
   southeastern Arizona over the past 20 years. We describe concurrent
   changes in vegetation and report the results of microhabitat
   manipulation experiments in which we removed broom snakeweed,
   Gutierrezia sarothrae, from 1.00-ha (pilot) or 0.56-ha (replicate
   follow-up) plots. D. spectabilis became extinct on control plots, but
   populations remained stable on plots where snakeweed was removed. On a
   larger scale, declines in numbers of kangaroo rats coincided with
   increases in density of woody plants. The data substantiate the
   preferences of this species for structurally open microhabitats and
   document that survival rates are higher in areas that are more open.
   Large kangaroo rat species like D. spectabilis are often regarded as
   keystone species, and our results indicate that they are vulnerable to
   grassland degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The photosynthetic performance, pigmentation, and growth of a Halimeda
   community were studied over a depth gradient on Conch Reef, Florida
   Keys, USA during summer-fall periods of 5 consecutive years. The
   physiology and growth of H. tuna (Ellis \& Solander) Lamouroux and H.
   opuntia (L.) Lamouroux on this algal dominated reef were highly
   variable. Maximum rate of net photosynthesis (P-max ), respiration rate,
   and quantum efficiency (alpha) did not differ between populations of
   either species at 7 versus 21 m, even though the 21-m site received a
   66\% lower photon flux density (PFD). Physiological parameters, as well
   as levels of photosynthetic pigments, varied temporally. P-max ,
   saturation irradiance, compensation irradiance, and growth were greatest
   in summer months, whereas alpha, chl a , chl b , and carotenoid
   concentrations were elevated each fall. Halimeda tuna growth rates were
   higher at 7 m compared with 21 m for only two of five growth trials.
   This may have arisen from variability in light and nutrient
   availability. Individuals growing at 7 m received a 29\% greater PFD in
   August 2001 than in 1999. In August 1999 and 2001 seawater temperatures
   were uniform over the 14-m gradient, whereas in August 2000 cold water
   regularly intruded upon the 21-m but not the 7-m site. These results
   illustrate the potentially dynamic relationship between nutrients,
   irradiance, and algal productivity. This suggests the necessity of
   long-term monitoring over spatial and temporal gradients to accurately
   characterize factors that impact productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The American Cancer Society (ACS) Study and its reanalysis are built
   upon in order to examine the impact of scale on the observed
   relationship between sulfates and mortality. The limitations of the
   original ACS Study (Pope et al., 1995) and the reanalysis of this study
   (Krewski et al., 2000) are discussed; while the latter dealt with some
   issues in using ecological data, it did not address scale. Next, the
   article outlines the county-scale study, the methods used to aggregate
   data, and the two-stage analysis used to derive relative risk (RR).
   Finally, the results of working at the county scale are compared with
   those obtained by the reanalysis team using larger metropolitan areas.
   Less than half of the cohort used in the metropolitan study were used at
   the county scale because of the limited availability of sulfate monitors
   and because five-digit ZIP codes more accurately assigned individuals to
   geographical areas. Therefore, the county data should be considered as
   new and not as a reorganization of the original data set. The reanalysis
   and the county studies should be considered as two separate studies that
   took different scales as their basic organizing principle. The RR of
   all-cause mortality from sulfate exposure at the county scale was 1.50
   (1.30, 1.73) compared with 1.25 (1.13, 1.37) at the metropolitan scale;
   for cardiopulmonary mortality, the RR was 1.75 (1.48, 2.08) at the
   county scale compared with 1.29 (1.15, 1.46) at the metropolitan scale.
   Because lung cancer mortality was low in some counties, the two-stage
   random effects model became unstable. At the county scale, the RR from
   sulfates was more robust to the inclusion of ecologic covariates. Other
   place-specific ecologic covariates; were either insignificant or barely
   significant (with a lower 95\% confidence limit near 0.99 or 1.00) when
   included in the two-stage regression model for all-cause mortality with
   sulfates. Moreover, no ecologic covariate changed the RR of all-cause
   mortality from sulfates by 25\% or more. Both population change and
   unemployment rate affected the RR for cardiopulmonary mortality from
   sulfate exposure by 25\% or more in the county-scale analysis. However,
   when these two variables were entered into a multiple covariate
   analysis, the RR from sulfates decreased but remained strongly
   significant. Sulfur dioxide was not an important covariate at the county
   scale. Thus, at the county scale, long-term exposure to sulfates appears
   to be more strongly associated with increased risk of all-cause and
   cardiopulmonary mortality than previously indicated by the ACS study and
   its reanalysis.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean Sea, top predators, and particularly cetacean
   odontocetes, accumulate high concentrations of organochlorine
   contaminants and toxic metals, incurring high toxicological risk. In
   this paper we investigate the use of the skin biopsies as a non-lethal
   tool for evaluating toxicological hazard of organochlorines in
   Mediterranean cetaceans, presenting new data 10 years after the paper
   published by Fossi and co-workers {[}Mar. Poll. Bull. 24 (9) (1992) 459]
   in which this new methodology was first presented. Some organochlorine
   compounds, now with worldwide distribution, are known as endocrine
   disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Here the unexplored hypothesis that
   Mediterranean cetaceans are potentially at risk due to organochlorines
   with endocrine disrupting capacity is investigated. High concentrations
   of DDT metabolites and PCB congeners (known as EDCs) were found in the
   different Mediterranean species (Stenella coeruleoalba, Delphinus
   delphis, Tursiops truncatus and Balaenoptera physalus). In this paper we
   also propose benzo(a)pyrene monooxygenase (BPMO) activity in marine
   mammal skin biopsies (non-lethal biomarker) as a potential indicator of
   exposure to organochlorines, with special reference to the compounds
   with endocrine disrupting capacity. A statistically significant
   correlation was found between BPMO activity and organochlorine levels
   (DDTs, pp'DDT, op'DDT, PCBs and PCB99) in skin biopsies of males of B.
   physalus. Moreover a statistical correlation was also found between BPMO
   activity and DDT levels in skin biopsies of the endangered Mediterranean
   population of D. delphis. These results suggest that BPMO induction may
   be an early sign of exposure to organochlorine EDCs and can be used for
   periodic monitoring of Mediterranean marine mammal toxicological status.

Abstract = {{A set of microcosm experiments was performed to assess different
   bioremediation strategies, i.e., biostimulation. and bioaugmentation,
   for groundwater contaminated with chlorobenzenes. The biodegradative
   potential was stimulated either by the supply of electron acceptors
   (air, (NO3-), to increase the activity of the indigenous bacterial
   community, or by the addition of aerobic chlorobenzene-degrading
   bacteria (Pseudomonas putida GJ31, Pseudomonas aeruginosa RHO1,
   Pseudomonas putida F1DeltaCC). Experiments were performed with natural
   groundwater of the aquifer of Bitterfeld, which had been contaminated
   with 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB), and
   chlorobenzene (CB). The microcosms consisted of airtight glass bottles
   with 800 mL of natural groundwater and were incubated under in situ
   temperature (13degreesC). Behavior of the introduced strains within the
   indigenous bacterial community was monitored by fluorescent in situ
   hybridization (FISH) with species-specific oligonucleotides. Dynamics of
   the indigenous community and the introduced strains within the
   microcosms were followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism
   (SSCP) analysis of 16S rDNA amplicons obtained from total DNA of the
   microbial community. An indigenous biodegradation potential under
   aerobic as well as anaerobic denitrifying conditions was observed
   accompanied by fast and specific changes in the natural bacterial
   community composition. Augmentation with P. aeruginosa RHO1 did not
   enhance bio-degradation. In contrast, both P. putida GJ31 as well as P.
   putida F1DeltaCC were capable of growing in groundwater, even in the
   presence of the natural microbial community, and thereby stimulating
   chlorobenzene depletion. P. putida GJ31 disappeared when the xenobiotics
   were depleted and P. putida F1DeltaCC persisted even in the absence of
   CB. Detailed statistical analyses revealed that community dynamics of
   the groundwater microbiota were highly reproducible but specific to the
   introduced strain, its inoculum size, and the imposed physicochemical
   conditions. These findings could contribute to the design of better in
   situ bioremediation strategies for contaminated groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{The US Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) Red Wolf Recovery Program
   recognizes hybridization with coyotes as the primary threat to red wolf
   recovery. Efforts to curb or stop hybridization are hampered in two
   ways. First, hybrid individuals are difficult to identify based solely
   on morphology. Second, managers need to effectively search 6000 km(2)
   for the presence of coyotes and hybrids. We develop a noninvasive method
   to screen large geographical areas for coyotes and hybrids with maternal
   coyote ancestry by combining mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis of
   faeces (scat) and geographic information system (GIS) technology. This
   method was implemented on the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge
   (1000 km(2) ) in northeastern North Carolina. A total of 956 scats were
   collected in the spring of 2000 and 2001 and global positioning system
   (GPS) coordinates were recorded. Seventy-five percent of the scats were
   assigned to species and five coyote/hybrid scats were detected.
   Placement of scat location coordinates on a map of the experimental
   population area revealed that four of the coyote/hybrid scats were
   detected within the home ranges of sterilized hybrids. The other
   coyote/hybrid scat indicated the presence of a previously unknown
   individual. We suggest this method be expanded to include more of the
   experimental population area and be optimized for use with nuclear
   markers to improve detection of hybrid and back-crossed individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment failures of stocked kokanees (lacustrine sockeye salmon
   Oncorhynchus nerka) in Lake Roosevelt have led to examination of various
   limiting factors. We evaluated the predatory impacts of piscivores on
   hatchery-released and net-pen-released kokanees and rainbow trout O.
   mykiss from the Sherman Creek Hatchery in 1999 and 2000. We used an
   angler tournament to mark walleyes Stizostedion vitreum for an abundance
   estimate, and then used gillnetting and electrofishing to collect
   recaptures and monitor the diet of walleyes. A bioenergetics model was
   used to quantify consumption, and estimates were extrapolated to walleye
   abundance to determine a percent loss of hatchery fish. Kokanees
   averaged 22-100\% of the diet contents of walleyes (>300 mm total
   length), whereas rainbow trout averaged 0-25\%, depending on location
   and timing following release. In 1999, we estimated that 16,610 walleyes
   consumed 15\% of the hatchery kokanees within 41 d of release; however,
   our diet information did not correspond spatially with our population
   estimate. In 2000, we corrected our spatial bias and estimated that the
   population of 12,233 walleyes consumed 9.4\% of the hatchery kokanees
   and 7.3\% of the hatchery rainbow trout within 41 d of release. We
   conclude that the walleye population in northern Lake Roosevelt was
   effectively ``swamped{''} by the biomass of salmonids released at the
   Sherman Creek Hatchery. However, piscivores may still limit kokanee
   recruitment, depending on long-term predation rates for the
   reservoir-wide walleye population.}},

Abstract = {{Milltown Dam annually impedes the migration of 11 fish species, and data
   suggest that fish that migrate to the dam do not spawn once their
   migration is impeded. Densities of westslope cutthroat trout
   Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi and bull trout Salvelinus confluentus are low
   near Milltown Dam, but their annual presence at the dam suggests the
   potential to reestablish fluvial life history forms and enhance local or
   upriver populations. Operating a fish trap at Milltown Dam in 2000 and
   2001, 1 captured westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout, implanted 42
   with radio transmitters, and transported them upstream of Milltown Dam.
   I monitored the implanted fish to determine posttransport movements and
   spawning. Most of the fish captured continued upstream to spawn, and
   many migrations exceeded 100 kin after transport. Several fish
   encountered pre- or postspawning problems, including entrainment in
   irrigation ditches, predation by normative northern pike Esox lucius,
   angler harvest, and fallback over Milltown Dam. These movements
   elucidate the need for comprehensive watershed-level restoration and
   measures to mitigate the continued effects of Milltown Dam. Whereas
   habitat restoration may contribute to the long-term recovery of
   depressed populations, adding spawning adults provides immediate
   benefits to the upriver populations. Because bull trout numbers in the
   Clark Fork River system are very low, the addition of a few individuals
   could significantly enhance recruitment and aid recovery. The success of
   capture, transport, and spawning suggests that this is an effective,
   albeit labor-intensive way to enhance or restore spawning individuals to
   populations of westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout that have been
   fragmented by Milltown Dam until permanent fish passage is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Stream restoration has accelerated in the Midwestern United States
   during the past decade, but the effects of restoration on stream biota
   are rarely evaluated. From 1997 to 2000, we studied the responses in
   fish communities to the attempted restoration of two channelized streams
   (Juday Creek and Potato Creek) in northwestern Indiana, each of which
   received two new meanders to a 1-km reach of stream length. The restored
   meanders of Juday Creek also received major improvement to instream
   habitat, bank stabilization, and silt control. In contrast, Potato Creek
   received only reconnection of the stream to historical meanders. Fish
   were monitored for 3 years after reconstruction by use of
   electroshocking and salmonid redd surveys. In Juday Creek, trout
   size-class distribution broadened and redd construction increased in the
   restored reaches. However, most fish metrics for reconstructed reaches
   did not surpass the levels in the channelized reaches after 3 years.
   Continued sedimentation from upstream sources, which reduced habitat
   quality, likely counteracted the positive effects of the restoration. In
   contrast, unanticipated geomorphic changes in Potato Creek led to
   decreased current velocity and highly altered fish community structure.
   The American brook lamprey Lampetra appendix, a sensitive species, was
   not collected after restoration, and the fish community changed from
   rheophilic species to highly tolerant, slow-water species. Overall,
   changes in fish community structure revealed strengths and weaknesses in
   contemporary stream restoration approaches, findings that will aid
   future restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The development of resistance in the Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita
   molesta (Busck) to organophosphorus (OP) insecticides (azinphos-methyl
   and phosmet) is a serious threat to the tender fruit industry in Ontario
   (50\% crop losses in 1994). Resistance to carbamate insecticides and
   increased survival of field-collected moths at diagnostic concentrations
   of pyrethroids were widespread. As a result, four different treatment
   regimes were tested to manage resistance in G molesta, and the changes
   in resistance frequencies under each treatment regime were monitored
   from 1996 to 1999. The data indicated that the levels of resistance were
   significantly influenced by the various treatment regimes. The seasonal
   pattern of resistance was similar for all treatment regimes, in that
   resistance peaked in mid-season and declined in the late season. Levels
   of resistance in G molesta to OPs decreased from 55\% to 14\% and that
   to pyrethroids declined from 30\% to 10\% from 1996 to 1999 under a
   treatment regime consisting of endosulfan-organophosphate-pyrethroid
   rotation. Similarly, under a treatment regime implemented in commercial
   orchards (organophosphate-pyrethroid rotation), resistance to OP
   insecticides declined from 50\% to 12\% and resistance to pyrethroids
   evolved to around 16\%. The overall data indicated that resistance was
   unstable; a strategy based on rotation of insecticides by class for each
   generation of G molesta was successful in managing resistance to both OP
   and pyrethroid insecticides. The rotational strategy has been widely
   adopted by growers and is applied to ca 85\% of the acreage. For the

Abstract = {{Single-lesion isolates of Cercospora beticola (n=150) were collected in
   1998 from sugar beet fields in the area of Serres, N. Greece. In this
   area, sterol demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicides have been used
   for almost 20 years to control sugar beet leaf spot. The sensitivity of
   these isolates to the DMI fungicides flutriafol and difenoconazole (EC50
   values) was determined on the basis of inhibition of mycelial growth at
   several fungicide concentrations. The relative growth (RG) of isolates
   was correlated at all tested concentrations with the respective EC50
   values, indicating that RG provides a reliable estimate for the
   sensitivity of the isolates. The highest correlation coefficients were
   obtained for concentrations of 1 mug ml(-1) flutriafol and of 0.05 mug
   ml(-1) difenoconazole, respectively. Consequently, they are proposed for
   monitoring of DMI sensitivity in C. beticola populations, as single
   discriminatory concentrations in a simplified test method. Based on the
   RG values at the discriminatory concentration of 1 mug ml(-1)
   flutriafol, C beticola isolates were classified as either resistant or
   sensitive. The efficacy of flutriafol, applied at the commercially
   recommended dose, in controlling Cercospora leaf spot was examined in
   field experiments conducted during 1999 and 2000. Disease incidence in
   plots artificially inoculated with resistant isolates and treated with
   flutriafol was significantly higher than in similar plots inoculated
   with sensitive strains. These results suggest that poor disease control
   after application of flutriafol may be based on the presence of
   resistant strains within the pathogen population in northern Greece.
   This emphasizes the risk of the development of practical resistance if
   there is increased frequency of such strains within the population.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrification by soil nitrifiers may result in substantial losses of
   applied nitrogen through NO3- leaching and N2O emission. The biological
   inhibition of nitrification by crop plants or pasture species is not
   well known. This study was conducted to evaluate the ability of three
   pasture species, Brachiaria humidicola, B. decumbens and Melinis
   minutiflora to inhibit nitrification. Plants were grown in a growth
   chamber for sixty days, fertilized with (NH4)(2)SO4. After harvesting,
   the soil was incubated with (NH4)(2)SO4 for 24 days. Ammonium oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB), NH4-N levels, and N2O emission were monitored at 4 d
   intervals. Among the species studied, B. humidicola inhibited
   nitrification and maintained NH4-N in soil to a much greater extent than
   the other two species. This nitrification inhibition lasted for 12 days
   after initiation of soil incubation study (i.e. from 60 DAS when the
   plants were harvested). The AOB populations and N2O emission from the
   soil were significantly lower in the soils where B. humidicola has been
   grown compared to the other two species. Root exudates and soil extracts
   of B. humidicola suppressed AOB populations, whereas those of B.
   decumbens and M. minutiflora did not. The results are in consistence
   with the hypothesis that B. humidicola suppressed nitrification and N2O
   emissions through an inhibitory effect on the AOB population.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the response of a clonal herb, Prunella vulgaris, to its
   position in a gap, the identity of neighbouring graminoid species, and
   simulation of competition for light. The growth characteristics, such as
   stolon length, internode length and number of stolons were recorded in
   competitive environments with graminoid bunches of Molinia caerulea,
   Juncus effusus and Nardus stricta and in different types of gaps in a
   manipulative field experiment. Two pot experiments studied the effect of
   reduced light and of low red/far red ratio (R/FR) on the plant growth
   characteristics. In both field and pot experiments we monitored stolon
   orientation in a treatment divided into two parts (competition/shaded or
   gap/unshaded). Methods of circular statistics were used to evaluate
   stolon orientation. The graminoid bunches had equivalent effects on
   plant vegetative growth-plants had longer stolons and internodes than
   plants growing in gaps. The effects of treatments on other
   characteristics (amounts of stolons and leaves) were not significant. In
   divided treatment, plants responded by accumulation of stolons and
   leaves in vegetation removed part, and avoided the vegetated part. In
   the pot experiments the plant biomass and stolon number decreased in low
   R/FR and in low irradiance treatments, but the internodes in low R/FR
   were 26\% longer compared to the control. Centroids were uniformly
   distributed in divided low R/FR treatment contrary to low irradiance
   treatment where they showed preference for unshaded part. No dependency
   of stolon length on its orientation was found in divided treatments of
   both experiments. Prunella vulgaris in heterogeneous environment
   distinguished favourable and less favourable conditions and produced
   more stolons with shorter internodes under favourable conditions. This
   resulted in concentration of resource acquiring structures in favourable
   patches.}},

Abstract = {{The movements of two adult female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in East
   Greenland and the Greenland Sea area were studied by use of satellite
   telemetry between the fall of 1994 and the summer of 1998. One female
   was tracked for 621 days, the other for 1,415 days. During this time the
   females used maternity dens on land. If denning periods on land were
   excluded, the two females used between 73\% and 100\% of the tracking
   time offshore where they were able to navigate in the dynamic pack ice
   and counteract the fast southward movement of the ice (up to 30 km/h) in
   the East Greenland Current. Mean monthly movement rates varied between
   0.32 and 0.76km/h. Both bears had very large home ranges (242,000 and
   468,000 km(2)) within the dynamic pack ice of the Greenland Sea. The
   facts that the bears made extensive use of the offshore sea ice and that
   there is a marked reduction of the Greenland Sea ice call for a closer
   monitoring of the effects of this change on the East Greenland polar
   bear population.}},

Abstract = {{Anurans have been the subject of numerous experimental and monitoring
   studies, yet their autecology under natural conditions remains poorly
   understood. Previous work has focussed on the pre-metamorphic life
   stages, with data suitable for estimating demographic parameters for all
   life stages collected in few species. This deficiency has almost
   certainly confounded current views of amphibian autecology and
   understanding of which mechanisms of decline represent the greatest
   threats to the persistence of amphibian species. We used a
   stage-structured metapopulation model, parameterised with comprehensive
   field data, to explore the sensitivity of two species of myobatrachid
   frogs from the southwest of Australia, Geocrinia alba and G. vitellina,
   to changes in demographic parameters at all life stages. The simulation
   modelling indicated that the population dynamics of both species were
   consistently most sensitive to changes in juvenile survival, then to
   fecundity, and third to both adult survival and standard deviation of
   survival to about equal extent. In practical terms, this indicates that
   management interventions which attempt to mitigate reductions in
   juvenile survival are likely to be most successful in arresting anuran
   metapopulation declines.}},

Abstract = {{To provide an assessment of the current status of populations of the
   lesser prairie chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) in southeastern New
   Mexico, this study monitored 4,368 sites along 3,428 km of transects,

   during April 2000 and 2001. Of 249 monitoring sites along 195 km of
   transects north of US380, vocalizations originating at active leks were
   heard at 46 sites on 31,232 hectares surveyed. Of 4,119 monitoring sites
   along 3,233 km of transects south of US380, one prairie chicken was
   observed at one site and vocalizations from one active lek were heard at
   two sites on 517,376 hectares surveyed. As has been documented in other
   parts of its range, the lesser prairie chicken in extreme southeastern
   New Mexico (area south of US380) appears to have experienced a

Abstract = {{After nearly 3 decades of decline, the western stock of Steller sea
   lions (SSL; Eumetopias jubatus) was listed as an endangered species in
   1997. While the cause of the decline in the 1970s and 1980s has been
   attributed to nutritional stress, recent declines are unexplained and
   may result from other factors including the presence of environmental
   contaminants. SSL tissues show accumulation of butyltins, mercury, PCBs,
   DDTs, chlordanes and hexachlorobenzene. SSL habitats and prey are
   contaminated with additional chemicals including mirex, endrin,
   dieldrin. hexachlorocyclohexanes, tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and
   related compounds, cadmium and lead. In addition, many SSL haulouts and
   rookeries are located near other hazards including radioactivity,
   solvents, ordnance and chemical weapon dumps. PCB and DDT concentrations
   measured in a few SSL during the 1980s were the highest recorded for any
   Alaskan pinniped. Some contaminant exposures in SSL appear to be
   elevated in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea compared to southeast
   Alaska, but there are insufficient data to evaluate geospatial
   relationships with any certainty. Based on very limited blubber data,
   current levels of PCBs may not pose a risk to SSL based on comparison to
   immunotoxicity tissue benchmarks, but SSL may have been at risk from
   pre-1990 PCB exposures. While exposure to PCBs and DDTs may be
   declining, SSL are likely exposed to a multitude of other contaminants
   that have not been monitored. The impacts of these exposures on SSL
   remain unknown because causal effects have not been established. Field
   studies with SSL have been limited in scope and have not yet linked
   contaminant exposures to adverse animal health or population effects.
   Several biomarkers may prove useful for monitoring exposure and
   additional research is needed to evaluate their utility in SSL. We
   conclude that there are insufficient data to reject the hypothesis that
   contaminants play a role in the continued decline of SSL, and suggest
   that a coordinated monitoring program be developed which can be related
   to key biological, ecological and laboratory toxicity data. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Hinge-back tortoises are actively hunted by human populations in
   sub-Saharan Africa, and are currently threatened in wide areas of their
   ranges. The wide wetlands and moist rainforests of the Niger Delta
   (southeastern Nigeria, west Africa) house three sympatric species of
   hinge-back tortoises: Kinixys erosa, K. homeana, and K. belliana
   nogueyi. These tortoises are subjected to strong hunting pressure for
   several reasons (mainly domestic consumption), but in a few places in
   Bayelsa and Rivers States (eastern axis of the Niger Delta), they are
   traditionally venerated as ``holy animals{''} bringing happiness. These
   few places may represent ideal laboratories for monitoring the effects
   of hundreds of years of ``traditional conservation{''} on the wild
   populations of a tropical reptile. Here, I compare the apparent
   abundance, sex ratio, body sizes, microhabitats, and seasonal occurrence
   of free-ranging Kinixys populations inhabiting three of these
   ``traditional sanctuaries{''} with the same ecological aspects of
   conspecifics from three neighbouring areas where the tortoises are
   actively hunted. K. homeana was the most common species at all sites,
   followed by K. erosa, whereas K. belliana was extremely rare. Adult sex
   ratio did not depart significantly from equality both in K. erosa and in
   K. homeana, and was not influenced by locality or by type of
   ``management{''} (veneration or harvesting). The frequency of juveniles
   of K. homeana was significantly higher in areas with traditional
   veneration than in areas of harvesting, but the same pattern was not
   observed in K. erosa. There was a significant decrease in terms of the
   number of observed specimens between areas of traditional protection and
   areas of usual harvesting in all species, and this trend was more
   obvious in K. homeana than in K. erosa. The ratio ``number of observed
   erosa/number of observed homeana{''} was not dependent on the presence
   of traditional veneration. Mean body sizes were not different in harvest
   areas and in veneration areas in K. homeana, but the same comparisons
   were not done for K. erosa because sample sizes were too small.
   Tortoises in veneration areas inhabited a wider range of microhabitats
   than in harvest areas, where they were found almost only in dense
   bushes. Specimens of both K. erosa and K. homeana were observed mainly
   during the wet season, and this excess of observed specimens was
   significantly affected both by locality and by type of management, i.e.,
   the frequency of observed specimens of both species during the dry
   season was significantly higher in areas with traditional veneration
   than in areas with local harvesting. The conservation implications of
   the ecological patterns observed are discussed. (C) 2003 Editions

Abstract = {{Nitrification potential is the maximum capacity of a soil's population
   of nitrifying bacteria to transform NH4+-N to NO3--N. Time of season and
   the effect of several management practices on nitrification potentials
   were measured via an amended slurry method, shaken for 24 h at 25
   degreesC. Management strategies that reduce potential nitrification
   rates without limiting plant N uptake may increase the ratio of plant
   biomass to plant N content (PB:N), the aboveground net primary
   production (ANPP) per unit of N in ANPP, and decrease the amount of NO3-
   available for leaching, and/or conversion to N2O. Sites were located in
   Hickory Corners, MI, USA, on Haplic Luvisols. Management practices
   included: substitution of compost for N fertilizer, use of a rotation in
   place of continuous maize and the addition of cover crops. A previously
   tilled, successional grassland was used as a contrast to agricultural
   managements. Where N fertilizer was applied, nitrification potential
   increased in late May and again in late August-October. The seasonal
   pattern was similar but less pronounced where compost was applied.
   Nitrification rates were 4.2 times greater than that of the successional
   site when N fertilizer was applied. Use of N fertilizer increased
   nitrification potentials 1.5 times above treatments where compost was
   applied during 1998 and 1999 in the 6th and 7th years of the rotation.
   In some instances, nitrification potentials could be correlated with in
   situ NO3--N measurements. Average PB:Ns in the fertilizer management
   were greater or equivalent to the successional grassland site. Compost
   increased PB:N above that of N fertilizer. Utilization of compost
   decreased nitrification potentials, maintained yields, and increased
   PB:N. The crop N content was lower when compost was applied. Thus, grain
   and stover quality may be lowered and need to be monitored. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Movements and dispersal distances are. fundamental aspects of ecology
   and evolutionary biology. Northern bobwhites (Cations virginianus)
   generally are considered the least mobile of all gallinaceous species,
   but dispersal events of bobwhites (commonly referred to as
   ``shuffling{''}) are well known. Although dispersal may be a key
   component in regulating population densities and inbreeding avoidance,
   few studies have attempted to explain relationships between dispersal,
   mortality and nest success in northern bobwhites. To examine these
   relationships, we monitored 957 radio-marked bobwhite from 1991 to 1996.
   Mean dispersal distance did not differ between sexes (P = 0.699). Mean
   dispersal distances of adults (2821 m) were shorter than those of
   juveniles (3411 m; P = 0.042). We found no sex-or age-related
   differences in survival rates among dispersers and non-dispersers.
   Despite associated risks with increased movement activity in unfamiliar
   areas, survival rate was 1.5-times greater for dispersers(S = 0.72) than
   non-dispersers (S = 0.50). Further, we found no relationships between
   nest success and dispersal distance, suggesting that dispersal distance
   had little influence on reproductive output of bobwhites. Thus,
   dispersers may play a key role in bobwhite population dynamics whereby
   declining populations escape extinction through recruitment from
   productive populations.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in amphibian species have become a worldwide concern. This
   concern is heightened by predicted global climatic changes that may
   result in shifts in current patterns of local precipitation. Because of
   the potential dependence of successful breeding by amphibians on
   rainfall patterns, we tested the relationship between breeding by the
   rare gopher frog (Rana capito) and rainfall. We used data collected from
   long-term (1988-2000) monitoring of breeding activity at two ponds (one
   ephemeral, one semi-permanent) located in the Lower Coastal Plain of
   Alabama. Egg-mass counts at both ponds showed a significant positive
   relationship between reproductive effort and rainfall during the
   breeding season. Individuals of X capito disperse for considerable
   distances across a xeric landscape and wet conditions allow greater
   access to breeding sites for more distantly dispersed frogs. We did not
   find a significant trend in the number of egg masses laid over time at
   the ephemeral pond; however, there was a significant increase in egg
   masses deposited at the semipermanent pond during the course of this
   study. Understanding the importance of environmental variables such as
   rainfall will hopefully lead to the successful conservation of this and
   other species of amphibians with similar environmental requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A monitoring programme was developed from July 1992 to June 1993 using
   light traps in a plantation of Eucalyptus urophylla in the municipality
   of Tres Marias, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A total of 437 species of
   the Lepidoptera order was collected and divided into the following
   groups: primary pests: 11; secondary pests: 18; species without defined
   importance to eucalyptus culture: 65 and non-identified species: 343.
   These four groups had 1295.35, 24.40, 127.20 and 1030.55 individuals per
   light trap, respectively, with a total of 2477.50 Lepidoptera
   individuals collected per light trap during this period. Most frequent
   primary pests were Psorocampa denticulata (Notodontidae), Stenalcidia
   grosica (Geometridae) and Eupseudosoma aberrans (Arctiidae) which were
   constant species (present in more than 50\% of the collections) with a
   higher number of individuals during the driest and coldest periods,
   except P. denticulata, which showed more individuals during the hottest
   and most humid periods of the year. Faunistic analysis of this area
   showed a possibility of outbreaks of these primary pests, and mainly of
   R denticulata.}},

Abstract = {{Male-biased sex ratios in populations of parasitic wasps used in
   biological control are undesirable, because a low proportion of females
   can prevent the establishment of introduced species or hinder commercial
   production of species used for augmentative control. Studies were
   conducted on potential factors contributing to male-biased sex ratios
   that have been encountered in laboratory rearings of the braconid
   endoparasitoid Glyptapanteles flavicoxis (Marsh) using the gypsy moth,
   Lymantria dispar (L.), as a host. Sex determination in this wasp is
   arrhenotokous (haplodiploid). In the first experiment, we stored adults
   at 13 or 16degreesC and allowed them to mate at 20 or 25degreesC and
   found that sex ratios (expressed as percentage females) did not differ
   among progeny of parents; many females produced all male progeny,
   suggesting that they had not been fertilized. In the second experiment,
   females were exposed to hosts soon (0 - 60 min) after mating or 23-25 It
   later. Sex ratios were higher (less male-biased) in progenies of females
   provided with the rest period than in those which were not. In a third
   experiment, females were allowed to mate from one to four times with a
   given male. Although differences between these groupings were not
   statistically significant, the data suggested that more than two matings
   might depress sex ratios of progeny. An alternative analysis with only
   two groupings (1-2 matings and 3-4 matings) suggested that more than two
   matings might increase male bias of progeny. Therefore, we suggest that
   matings of this species be monitored in sleeve cages so that paired
   females can be removed and separated after copulation to diminish the
   likelihood of excessive matings, then given a rest period before they
   are offered hosts for parasitization.}},

Abstract = {{In a honey bee population of 150 colonies, the development of an
   introduced Varroa destructor mite population was monitored in swarming
   and non-swarming colonies for two years in a Nordic climate. The results
   demonstrated a reduced mite population as a result of swarming only for
   the first swarm season studied. In the second swarm season, there were
   much higher mite levels (based on debris counts of mites) and fewer
   colonies swarmed, but there was no significant difference in infestation
   levels of adult bees in the fall between swarming and non-swarming
   colonies. This result was interpreted as an effect of host-parasite
   interactions, where the detrimental influence from the infestation
   prohibited growth (and swarming) in some colonies, but allowed better
   mite reproduction opportunities (and swarming) in others. Surprisingly,
   the mite infestation levels of swarms in the late fall were not
   significantly different from those of swarming colonies the same year,
   indicating that swarm survival may be almost as much affected by V.
   destructor, as intact, swarming colonies. No horizontal mite transfer
   through robbing was observed. The results suggest that, horizontal mite
   transfer may not be as important in a Nordic climate where many bee
   colonies die over winter along with their mites, as it is in warmer
   climates.}},

Abstract = {{The fisheries of Lake Victoria in East Africa must be managed
   effectively to ensure sustainable food supplies. This has been
   impossible in the past due to inadequate knowledge of commercially
   important fish stocks. Here we present the first acoustic abundance
   estimates of fish in Lake Victoria. Five lakewide acoustic surveys were
   conducted between 1999 and 2001, using the Simrad EY500 echo-integrator
   with a 120 kHz split-beam transducer. There are many species of fish in
   Lake Victoria, however, only limited identification of targets can be
   achieved by present methods. Broad categories were distinguished by
   visual examination of echo-traces. The echo-integrals were partitioned
   between four target groups: (1) the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a top
   predator, (2) small pelagics comprising mainly the dagaa Rastrineobola
   argentea together with mixed species of haplochromines, (3) the
   crustacean Caridina nilotica and (4) other species. Spatial and temporal
   differences in the Standing Crop were observed between north and south,
   and between shallow and deep water. Most fish were found inshore but the
   spatial distribution varied between seasons. Mid-lake fish densities
   were higher in August compared to February. In August, the water column
   is well mixed while in February it is stratified with a low-oxygen layer
   inhospitable to fish near the bottom. There are consequent changes in
   the characteristics of observed echo-traces. Over the survey series,
   Nile perch biomass showed a consistent decline, while the stocks of
   small pelagic species increased. We emphasize the need for simple rules
   to identify species, and hydrographic monitoring to assist echo-trace
   classification. In the absence of any other source of comprehensive
   biomass estimates, the value of acoustic surveying in Lake Victoria is
   demonstrated. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS

Abstract = {{In populations of herring (Clupea harengus) or sprat (Sprattus
   sprattus), one typically observes a pattern of schools forming at dawn
   and dispersing at dusk, usually combined with vertical migration. This
   behaviour influences interactions with other species; hence a better
   understanding of the processes could contribute to deeper insight into
   ecosystem dynamics. This paper reports field measurements of the
   dispersal at dusk and examines two hypotheses through statistical
   modelling: that the vertical migration and the dissolution of schools is
   determined by decrease in light intensity, and that the dissolution of
   schools can be modelled by diffusion, i.e. active repulsion is not
   required. The field measurements were obtained during 3 days in March at
   one location in the Baltic Sea and included continuous hydroacoustical
   monitoring, trawl samples, and hydrographical CTD data. Echogram
   patterns were analysed using the school detection module in Echoview(R)
   and local light intensities were calculated using a model for surface
   illuminance. The data and the analysis support that schools migrate
   upwards during dusk, possibly trying to remain aggregated by keeping the
   local light intensities above a critical threshold, that schools
   initiate their dissolution when ambient light intensity drops below this
   critical threshold, and that fish subsequently swim in an uncorrelated
   random walk pattern. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is increasingly being used to restore and maintain
   oak-dominated (Quercus spp.) forests in the eastern United States. We
   assessed effects of prescribed burning on the nesting ecology of the
   Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Recent declines in Wood Thrush
   populations have prompted concern about their conservation status.
   Low-intensity surface fires in mixed-oak forests resulted in reductions
   in midstory vegetation, a documented habitat requirement for Wood
   Thrushes, but local population levels of Wood Thrushes did not differ
   between burned and unburned areas. Wood Thrushes inhabiting recently
   burned areas selected nest sites where leaf litter cover, fern cover,
   densities of shrubs and saplings, and moisture levels were higher and
   where fire intensity was lower in comparison to random sites. Wood
   Thrushes also placed their nests higher off the ground, and in taller
   and larger-diameter trees and shrubs, in burned than in unburned areas.
   Reproductive success did not differ between burned and unburned areas.
   However, successful nests were placed higher off the ground and in areas
   with lower densities of shrubs and saplings than unsuccessful nests in
   both burned and unburned areas. Prescribed burning appeared to have
   minimal effects on nesting ecology of Wood Thrushes, given their
   flexibility in nest placement, with no adverse consequences in terms of
   reproductive success. Local variation in fire intensity and moisture
   levels also maintained availability of suitable nesting habitat within
   burned areas. Continued monitoring would be appropriate to further
   assess the response of Wood Thrushes to prescribed burning, particularly
   in consideration of their conservation status and the uncertainty
   associated with potential long-term effects of habitat change.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved
   nitrate-N, Total-N (TN), dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP), total
   phosphorus (TP), dissolved silicate-Si (DSi) and their ratios in the
   world's largest rivers are examined using a global data base that
   includes 37\% of the earth's watershed area and half its population.
   These data were compared to water quality in 42 subbasins of the
   relatively well-monitored Mississippi River basin (MRB) and of 82 small
   watersheds of the United States. The average total nitrogen
   concentration varies over three orders of magnitude among both world
   river watersheds and the MRB, and is primarily dependent on variations
   in dissolved nitrate concentration, rather than particulate or dissolved
   organic matter or ammonium. There is also a direct relationship between
   the DIN: DIP ratio and nitrate concentration. When nitrate-N exceeds 100
   mug-at l(-1), the DIN: DIP ratio is generally above the Redfield ratio
   (16:1), which implies phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton growth.
   Compared to nitrate, the among river variation in the DSi concentration
   is relatively small so that the DSi loading (mass/area/time) is largely
   controlled by runoff volume. The well-documented influence of human
   activities on dissolved inorganic nitrogen loading thus exceeds the
   influences arising from the great variability in soil types, climate and
   geography among these watersheds. The DSi: nitrate-N ratio is controlled
   primarily by nitrogen loading and is shown to be inversely correlated
   with an index of landscape development-the ``City Lights{''} nighttime
   imagery. Increased nitrogen loading is thus driving the world's largest
   rivers towards a higher DIN: DIP ratio and a lower DSi: DIN ratio. About
   7.3 and 21\% of the world's population lives in watersheds with a DSi:
   nitrate-N ratio near a 1:1 and 2:1 ratio, respectively. The empirical
   evidence is that this percentage will increase with further economic
   development. When the DSi: nitrate-N atomic ratio is near 1:1, aquatic
   food webs leading from diatoms (which require silicate) to fish may be
   compromised and the frequency or size of harmful or noxious algal blooms
   may increase. Used together, the DSi: nitrate-N ratio and nitrate-N
   concentration are useful and robust comparative indicators of
   eutrophication in large rivers. Finally, we estimate the riverine
   loading to the ocean for nitrate-N, TN, DIP, TP and DSi to be 16.2, 21,
   2.6, 3.7 to 5.6, and 194 Tg yr(-1), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Mite populations, in particular those belonging to the Phytoseiidae
   family were monitored in a commercial vineyard comprising two varieties
   (Prosecco and Pinot gris). On Prosecco, densities of Amblyseius
   andersoni, and to a lesser extent of Typhlodromus pyri increased when
   downy mildew symptoms occurred on a high number of leaves. On Pinot, A.
   andersoni was the dominant species and its densities markedly increased
   when downy mildew spread. A. andersoni populations were significantly
   larger on leaves with downy mildew symptoms than on leaves without
   symptoms and their densities were positively correlated to the extent of
   leaf surface showing symptoms. The effect of downy mildew on T pyri
   populations was less marked. There were no relationships between downy
   mildew spread and spider mite abundance (Panonychus ulmi). Untreated
   plots or plots treated with folpet to control downy mildew were
   monitored in an experimental vineyard colonized by A. andersoni. A.
   andersoni populations increased when downy mildew symptoms spread and
   their densities were significantly higher in the control than on folpet
   plots. In another experimental vineyard, T pyri densities were
   significantly higher in the control (severely infected by downy mildew)
   than on copper hydroxide plots. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis
   (IEF) was employed to detect downy mildew in mites and glucose phosphate
   isomerase (GPI) was selected from among different enzymes. A stain
   corresponding to downy mildew in addition to the phytoseiid intrinsic
   stains was detected in a high proportion of A. andersoni and T pyri
   collected from infected leaves. Downy mildew stains were not detected in
   P. ulmi females collected from infected leaves. Most A. andersoni and T
   pyri females confined on symptomatic leaves became positive to IEF a few
   hours later. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Capsule Few positive responses by birds were observed in the first two
   years of this new agri-environment scheme.
   Aims To determine whether the pilot Arable Stewardship Scheme delivered
   increased populations of either breeding or wintering birds.
   Methods Birds were surveyed on both scheme and control sites. In the
   breeding season, a modified Breeding Bird Survey methodology was
   employed. Complete counts of all birds on each site were conducted in
   winter. Differences in numbers, or in the change in numbers between the
   first and second years, between scheme and control sites were assessed
   by multiple log-linear regression.
   Results Most species or guilds did not show significant responses to the
   scheme, although there were statistically significant positive effects
   on some key target groups, including breeding Lapwing Vanellus vanellus
   and wintering granivorous passerines.
   Conclusion The potential reasons for the lack of significant results,
   including the short length of the monitoring programme, are discussed.
   Future studies aimed at evaluating the effects of land management
   prescriptions on birds should be mindful of the time-scale over which
   monitoring is conducted.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that infection by larvae of the trematode
   Ribeiroia ondatrae accounts for a significant proportion of limb
   malformations currently observed in amphibian populations of North
   America. However, the effects of R. ondatrae infection on northern
   leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), one of the species most frequently
   reported with malformations, have not been adequately explored.
   Moreover, the risk factors associated with R. ondatrae-induced
   malformations have not been clearly identified. We examined the effects
   of timing of infection on tadpole survival and limb development. Rana
   pipiens tadpoles were individually exposed to R. ondatrae cercariae at
   the pre-limb-bud (Gosner stages 24 and 25), limb-bud (Gosner stages 27
   and 28), or paddle (Gosner stages 31-33) stages of development and
   monitored through metamorphosis. The effects of infection were
   stage-specific. Infections acquired at the pre-limb-bud stage resulted
   in a high mortality rate (47.5-97.5\%), whereas tadpoles infected at the
   limb-bud stage displayed a high malformation rate (16\% overall), and
   the magnitude of effects increased with the level of exposure to
   cercariae. In contrast, infections acquired at the paddle stage bad no
   effect on limb development or tadpole survival, which suggests that the
   timing of R. ondatrae infection in relation to the stage structure of
   tadpole populations in the wild is an important determinant of the
   degree to which populations are affected by R. ondatrae.}},

Abstract = {{Foliar phenol concentrations (total and simple phenols) were determined
   in Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) needles collected in June 2000,
   from 6 sites affected by various forms of atmospheric pollutants (NO,
   NO2, NOx, O-3 and SOD monitored during two months. Results show an
   increase in total phenol content with exposure to sulphur dioxide and a
   reduction with exposure to nitrogen oxide pollution. p-Coumaric acid,
   syringic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid concentrations increase with
   exposure to nitrogen oxide pollution, whereas gallic acid and vanillin
   decrease in the presence respectively of sulphur dioxide and ozone. This
   in situ work confirms the major interest of using total and simple
   phenolic compounds of P. halepensis as biological indicators of air
   quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a complexing agent and has
   the ability to form stable water-soluble complexes with metal ions. It
   is used in a variety of industrial applications including pulp and
   paper, metal, textile, leather rubber, pharmaceuticals, food, polymer
   production and others. Most of these applications are water based and
   lead to emissions into the waste water and reach sewage treatment
   plants. Industrial sources and municipal waste waters were monitored
   simultaneously. Mixed samples were taken over periods of one week at
   nine sample sites. The concentrations of EDTA were measured in waste
   water samples by gas chromatography using N-selective detection. The
   results showed that, although, the concentrations and loads were
   variable the paper manufacturing industry was the major EDTA contributor
   to the influent of the waste water treatment plant and contributed more
   than 98\% of the total load. All the other sources including two
   household areas, were comparably low. In waste water of households
   concentrations between 10 and 70 mug/l EDTA could be detected.
   Concentrations of EDTA from different industrial waste water sources
   ranged from 28 up to 3980 mug/1. Influent and effluent concentrations of
   the WWTP were usually high in the range of 500-940 and 390-760 mug/l;
   respectively. Elimination rates averaged 15\%, the calculation is based
   on emission loads. Specific emission factors were calculated based on
   population equivalents. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper we examine the content of farm animal biodiversity
   conservation measures currently under implementation in the European
   Union (EU), as a result of the application of EC Regulations 1257/99 and
   1750/99. We surveyed 69 Rural Development Plans (RDPs) set up in EU
   Member States. Our analysis focuses on six livestock mammalian species:
   asses, cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep. The starting point for
   our investigation is the Domestic Animals Diversity-Information System
   (DAD-IS) FAO database which monitors the status of breeds in the world.
   We compare breeds included in the DAD-IS FAO database with breeds
   covered by the various RDPs. The analysis highlights that many breeds at
   risk of extinction according the FAO are not included in the RDPs. The
   analysis also indicates that the main efforts of the RDPs are devoted to
   preserving local cattle and sheep breeds. As concerns the financial
   aspects of livestock biodiversity measures, we note that the payments
   offered to farmers do not take into account the different probabilities
   of extinction associated with each breed in each country. Furthermore,
   we observe that payments do not meet all of the relevant criteria stated
   in the EEC Regulations. In many cases, we observe that, in spite of the
   Union's support to farmers, it still remains unprofitable to rear local
   breeds. These anomalies suggest the need for a revision of the current
   EU supporting measures related to the conservation of livestock
   biodiversity. Finally, by using FAO indicators on the current population
   size of each breed, we estimate the level of expected public expenditure
   necessary to ensure the upgrading of breeds from their `at-risk' status
   to a `not-at-risk' status during the period 2000-2006. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This research used a model experimental system to explore the joint
   effects of resource fragmentation and resource deterioration on
   population dynamics. The system provides a rapid test of conservation
   theory and can aid in planning for large and expensive studies. The
   investigation subjected the sawtooth grain beetle, Oryzaephilus
   surinamensis (L.), to five experiments in which population abundance was
   monitored over time. Metapopulations were created by connecting adjacent
   vials of flour. with rubber tubes. The metapopulations were arranged in
   rings, and food was replenished at two-week, intervals. The experiments
   examined populations in (1) habitats becoming increasingly fragmented,
   (2) dynamically fragmenting structure with concurrent loss of resources
   over time, (3) static structure, dynamic resource loss and differing
   numbers of patches, (4) static structural arrangements with dynamic
   resource loss that mimic resource deterioration and destruction, and (5)
   static arrangements of connected fragments with an equal total amount of
   food in a few large patches or several Small patches. Time series of
   stage-specific abundances were compared in repeated.-measures ANOVA. The
   results show that populations respond in nonlinear ways to both the
   amount of food and area provided. Within a confined area, when food is
   plentiful, individual interaction limits population abundance. When the
   amount of food is reduced,. population abundance becomes food dependent.
   Immediate increase in immature abundance was a characteristic. of
   fragmentation while a delayed reduction of adults was characteristic of
   food reduction. The stage-specific interaction at intermediate food
   levels shows birth and death processes that control this system, and
   elucidates the relationship between area and food that is, integral to
   the dynamics of patchy populations.}},

Abstract = {{Demographically open communities are often viewed as stochastically
   structured assemblages because most colonizing juveniles arrive via
   unpredictable dispersal mechanisms. However, interactions between
   established residents and incoming juveniles may affect juvenile
   persistence in species-specific ways and could therefore impose a degree
   of determinism on future Community structure.
   Using 16 spatially isolated communities of, coral reef fishes, I
   conducted two experiments to determine how prior residency by two guilds
   of fishes affected juvenile recruitment. Each experiment factorially
   manipulated the presence and absence of two guilds: resident piscivores
   (groupers and moray eels) and interference competitors (territorial
   damselfishes).
   In the first experiment, guilds were manipulated via selective removals,
   and subsequent recruitment (larval settlement minus mortality) was
   monitored for 44 days. In the second experiment, guilds Were placed
   within large cages to prevent direct resident-juvenile interactions,
   while allowing for any cues produced by enclosed fishes, thereby testing
   whether incoming larvae used resident-derived cues to select or reject
   settlement sites. Colonizing juveniles were collected from each reef
   over 42 days to prevent confounding resident- and recruit-derived cues.
   In the first experiment, piscivores inhibited recruitment of a
   damselfish (Pomacentridae) and a surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), and
   enhanced recruitment of a wrasse (Labridae). In contrast, territorial
   damselfishes inhibited recruitment of the damselfish and the wrasse, and
   enhanced recruitment of the surgeonfish. Observations of early
   recruitment patterns suggested that recruitment differences were
   established rapidly during the night or dawn periods shortly after
   settlement and before each daily census. In the second experiment, there
   was no evidence that larvae used resident-derived cues to select
   settlement sites, suggesting that recruitment differences in the first
   experiment resulted from differential mortality caused by direct
   resident-recruit interactions rather than differential larval
   settlement.
   These results demonstrate that interactions between established
   residents and newly arrived juveniles can have a strong influence on
   juvenile persistence, and that such interactions appear to be strongest
   within hours of larval, settlement. Furthermore, because resident
   effects were species specific, the present composition of these
   communities may impose a previously undocumented degree of determinism
   on their future structure.}},

Abstract = {{Vernal pools are vulnerable to loss through development and agricultural
   and forestry practices owing to their isolation from open water bodies
   and their small size. Some vernal pool-dependent species are already
   listed in New England as Endangered, Threatened, or Species of Special
   Concern. Vernal pool creation is becoming more common in compensatory
   mitigation as open water ponds, in general, may be easier to create than
   wooded wetlands. However, research on vernal pool creation is limited, A
   recent National Research Council study (2001) cites vernal pools as
   ``challenging to recreate.{''} We reviewed documentation on 15 vernal
   pool creation projects in New England that were required by federal
   regulatory action. Our purpose was to determine whether vernal pool
   creation for compensatory mitigation in New England replaced key vernal
   pool functions by assessing project goals and documentation (including
   mitigation plans, pool design criteria, monitoring protocols, and
   performance standards). Our results indicate that creation attempts
   often fail to replicate lost pool functions. Pool design specifications
   are often based on conjecture rather than on reference wetlands or
   created pools that function successfully. Project monitoring lacks
   consistency and reliability, and record keeping by regulatory agencies
   is inadequate. Strengthening of protection of isolated wetlands in
   general, and standardization across all aspects of vernal pool creation,
   is needed to ensure success and to promote conservation of the long-term
   landscape functions of vernal pools.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade and a half, environmental monitoring programs
   have increased in number and importance. Large scale environmental
   monitoring programs often present design difficulties because they tend
   to measure many ( sometimes hundreds) of parameters through space and
   time. This paper reviewed and summarized one important component of
   environmental monitoring programs, the statistical survey design. Survey
   designs used for long-term monitoring programs lasting multiple (greater
   than or equal to3) occasions were reviewed, paying special attention to
   those published after 1985. During this review, two key components of
   the overall survey design were identified. The first key component was
   the membership design. Groups of population units sampled the same
   occasion were called panels here, and the membership design specified
   which units were members of which panels. The second component was the
   revisit design that specified when panels were to be revisited.
   Membership designs varied, but some form of simple random or systematic
   design was popular. Among revisit designs, four basic patterns were
   found in the literature and their relative strengths and weaknesses were
   summarized. To efficiently discuss revisit designs, a new unified
   short-hand notation was proposed and adopted.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient benzene measurements were conducted for the first time at four
   air monitoring sites in the Bangkok metropolitan region (BMR), from
   January to December 2001. Analytical results show that the mean benzene
   concentrations range from 42.4 mug/m(3) at the Din Daeng urban site to
   15.1 mug/m(3) at the Chaeng Wattana suburban site. The monitoring
   results show that at a larger distance from the roadside or a higher
   level from the street surface, the level of benzene decreases. Analysis
   of the ambient benzene concentrations was carried out with reference to
   meteorological influences and traffic density. In traffic analysis, the
   combined effects of street topography and traffic flows established high
   impact on the overall benzene concentration in Bangkok. Statistical
   analysis shows good correlations of blood benzene levels and trans,
   trans-muconic acid with ambient benzene and demonstrated substantial
   exposure from traffic. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights

Abstract = {{A field monitoring campaign investigating the suitability of (Cd,
   Zn)-metallothionein concentrations (MTs) in different tissues of the
   gudgeon as a biomarker for metal contamination in the aquatic
   environment was conducted. Gudgeons were captured at 10 sampling sites
   on a river system in Flanders (Belgium). Nine sampling sites were
   situated along a Cd and Zn gradient with a nearby tributary as the
   reference site. Cadmium, Cu, and Zn concentrations were measured in the
   water and sediments. Concentrations of (Cd, Zn)-MT were measured in
   different organs (gill, liver, kidney) of gudgeon (Gobio gobio). The
   hepatic and gill Cd and Zn concentrations, as well as the hepatic (Cd,
   Zn)-MT concentrations, reflected the polymetallic contamination
   gradient. Moreover, the hepatic Cd and Zn concentrations could describe
   72\% of the variance in the (Cd, Zn)-MT concentrations in the liver,
   illustrating the possible use of hepatic MT concentrations as a
   biomarker for environmental metal contamination. In this way a
   dose-response relationship could be established under natural
   conditions. However, a poor negative relation between the Cd and Zn
   concentrations in the gills and the corresponding (Cd, Zn)-MT
   concentrations was found. No relation between the Cd and Zn
   concentrations in the kidney tissue and the corresponding (Cd, Zn)-MT
   concentrations could be established. These results clearly illustrate
   the tissue-specificity of the MT concentrations, thus for monitoring
   purposes MT concentrations should be measured in liver tissues, rather
   than in kidney or gill tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Galveston Bay sediments exhibit substantial spatial and seasonal
   variability in rates of nitrification and aerobic methane oxidation. We
   examined the biogeochemical and microbiological controls on these
   processes using aerobic enrichment slurries. Potential aerobic methane
   and ammonia oxidation rates from unamended control slurries were
   compared to rates in slurries amended with methane, ammonium, or methane
   + ammonium. Bacterial community composition was monitored using
   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR amplified
   ribosomal and functional gene DNA. Potential methane and ammonia
   oxidation rates increased over time in sediments amended with methane
   and ammonium, respectively. The highest potential methane oxidation
   rates occurred in treatments receiving both ammonium and methane
   suggesting that methanotrophs in the enrichment cultures were nitrogen
   limited. The highest ammonia oxidation rates occurred in treatments
   amended with ammonium only. Treatments receiving both ammonium and
   methane exhibited ammonia oxidation rates and porewater ammonium
   concentrations similar to those measured in the unamended control
   suggesting that methanotrophs may have inhibited ammonia oxidation by
   sequestering available ammonia. Sequence analysis revealed a decrease in
   general bacterial community diversity over time and a shift in
   ammonia-oxidizing bacterial composition corresponding with methane
   availability. However, methanotroph community composition similarities
   between treatments with different relative methane oxidation rates
   suggest that changes in physiological activity, as well as shifts in
   community composition, contributed to the observed patterns in potential
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in high throughput analysis of mRNA expression have made it
   possible to establish gene expression profiles for different cells,
   tissues, diseases and exposure states. For instance, recent studies have
   demonstrated the utility of such an approach to classify sub-types of
   cancers with more detail than was previously possible. In addition, gene
   expression studies of ionizing radiation exposure both in vitro and in
   vivo are affording insight into the molecular mechanisms of mammalian
   radiation response. We have demonstrated that radiation expression
   profiles are a good predictor of p53 function in cell lines, and such
   profiles also indicate a major role for p53-regulated genes in the in
   vivo radiation response. Gene expression can be a sensitive indicator of
   radiation response as we have shown linear dose-responses for induction
   of several genes down to doses as low as 2 cGy. As profiles are
   established from radiation studies, it is hoped that they may be useful
   for identifying individuals with specific exposures or predisposition to
   negative outcome of exposure. Although this technology holds great
   promise, some obstacles remain to be overcome before it can be
   successfully applied to population studies.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation is considered to be one of three or four major hazards for
   personnel in space and has emerged as the most critical issue to be
   resolved for long-term missions, both orbital and interplanetary. Space
   habitats are stressful and dangerous environments. Health and medical
   consequences arising from microgravity, stress, and trauma include
   weakened immune systems, increased viral activity, and loss of bone
   mass. The greatest risks from radiation are generally assumed to be
   cancers and possibly damage to the central nervous system. Synergistic
   effects arising from the other environmental hazards along with abscopal
   and exogenic factors are likely. Space programs represent an exceptional
   opportunity for examining the biological consequences of low-dose
   exposures of humans to radiation at every level of progression. Although
   astronauts are a relatively small population, they are healthy,
   physically active volunteers who undergo extensive testing and medical
   examinations before, during, and after protracted exposures with
   periodic follow-up examinations. The radiation environments along with
   other hazards are likewise monitored and documented. Extensive
   international research programs are in progress. Seven years ago the
   U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration established the
   National Space Biomedical Research Institute through a cooperative
   agreement with a consortium of research and academic institutions in
   order to address radiation issues through a concerted, programmatic
   effort. Advanced technologies are rapidly being incorporated into these
   programs to determine the significance of new biological data and to
   evaluate the interplay among the different medical hazards. Programmatic
   in vivo and in vitro studies of the processes leading to carcinogenesis
   are in progress. Drugs and dietary supplements are being examined at the
   cellular and in vivo levels to assess their potential as dose-modifying
   agents. The infrastructure of this new approach, recent results, and
   research in progress are reviewed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Growth, survivorship, recruitment, and reproduction of Halimeda tuna, a
   dominant green alga in many reef systems of the Florida Keys, were
   monitored at a shallow back reef ( 4 - 7m) and deep reef slope ( 15 - 22
   m) on Conch Reef. Despite lower light intensities and similar grazing
   pressures, amphipod infestations, and epiphyte loads at both sites, the
   deeper site exhibited significantly higher growth rates in summer months
   over a 4-year period than found for the shallow population, possibly
   because of higher nutrient levels at depth and photoinhibition of
   shallow plants. Sexual reproductive events occurred simultaneously
   across the entire reef, with up to 5\% of the population at both sites
   developing gametangia. New upright axes formed from zygotes, asexual
   fragmentation, or vegetative runners. Plants appear to have persistent
   basal stumps that survive harsh environmental conditions, even if
   upright, photosynthetic axes are removed. Sexual reproduction and
   `smothering' by epiphyte overgrowth are hypothesized to be two causes of
   death for individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the spring arrival dates of migrant birds, particularly
   passerines, have been -reported from a range of locations. In this paper
   we take the opportunity provided by a -detailed monitoring scheme to
   examine several features of the timing and arrival pattern of White
   Storks (Ciconia ciconia) in Poznan province, western Poland during the
   period 1983 - 2002. In doing so, we address several criticisms
   associated with the use of first -arrival dates. We found no evidence of
   a weekend bias to phenological recording and, unlike in some other
   species, found no effect of population size on recorded arrival date.
   Some aspects of the arrival pattern got earlier over time and first
   arrival appears to have been about 10 days earlier in the last 20 years
   than in the previous century. Earlier arrival was associated with warmer
   spring weather and with a protracted arrival period. From our experience
   with this study, we suggest how the general public can be used to
   collect high quality phenological data.}},

Title = {{Transience, dispersal and survival rates in newt patchy populations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{72}},

Pages = {{567-575}},

Abstract = {{1. This work aims to illustrating how it is possible to measure
   different modalities of adult dispersal in two subdivided populations of
   the alpine newt (Triturus alpestris ). Recent developments in
   capture-mark-recapture methods make it possible to estimate transience
   rates from individuals captured only once. In the context of subdivided
   newt populations, transience is assumed to express nomadic behaviour
   that contribute to breeding dispersal. Skeletochronology and recaptures
   within each pond system also made it possible to estimate emigration
   rates and local dispersal.
   2. Two subdivided populations of alpine newts were monitored over 4 and
   5 years, respectively. Whereas population A is suspected to have been
   established for more than 100 years, population B was monitored when
   colonizing a newly created archipelago of ponds.
   3. Transience was detected in each population at similar rates (37\% in
   population A and 35\% in the population B). Annual apparent survival
   rates were estimated as 82\% in population A vs. 33\% in population B.
   Similarity of age structures between populations leads us to consider
   such low survival rates in population B as resulting from emigration.
   Emigration was thus negligible in population A and was estimated to
   reach 57.3\% in population B. Conversely, high local dispersal
   (movements within a pond system) was detected in population A, but not
   in population B.
   4. Even though the causation of dispersal in newts (genetic polymorphism
   vs. phenotypic plasticity) remains unexplored, our study succeeded in
   identifying several dispersal components that could result from
   different selective pressures (habitat heterogeneity at different
   temporal scales). Experimental approaches are needed to investigate the
   causative bases of these traits.}},

Abstract = {{Stipe lengths of sporophytes of Ecklonia cava Kjellman have been
   reported to be longer along the southeast than southwest coast of the
   Izu Peninsula, central Japan. Two bays in this region that have natural
   populations of E. cava, but with different stipe lengths, were chosen
   for transplant experiments to examine if stipe length was an
   environmentally controlled trait. Transplant experiments were carried
   out in order to determine whether large-type sporophytes of E. cava with
   long stipes growing in Nabeta Bay (southeast Izu Peninsula, Japan) would
   turn into small-type sporophytes with short stipes when transplanted to
   Nakagi Bay (southwest Izu Peninsula). Ten juvenile sporophytes of E.
   cava (stipe length <5 cm) were collected from Nabeta Bay (large-type
   habitat) and transplanted to Nakagi Bay (short-type habitat) in December
   1995. As a transplant control, ten juvenile sporophytes of E. cava
   growing in Nakagi Bay were also transplanted to the same artificial
   reefs. Growth and survival rates of the sporophytes were monitored
   monthly for 3 y until December 1998. The transplanted sporophytes showed
   an increase in their stipe length and diameter from winter to spring,
   whereas almost no increase was observed from summer to autumn. However,
   the elongation was greater in Nabeta sporophytes than in Nakagi
   sporophytes. The primary blade length increased mainly from winter to
   early spring and decreased largely in autumn. Average primary blade
   lengths were similar in both Nabeta and Nakagi sporophytes from the end
   of the first year of transplanting. Although ca. 70\% of both Nabeta and
   Nakagi sporophytes survived during the first 2 y after transplantation,
   no Nakagi sporophytes and only two Nabeta sporophytes survived to the
   end of the 3 y study period. Despite transplantation to Nakagi Bay,
   where short sitpes are naturally present, the sporophytes from Nabeta
   Bay persisted in having longer stipes, which suggests that stipe length
   is genetically, rather than environmentally, controlled.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes one of the first well-documented field examples of
   natural attenuation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in groundwater in a
   fractured shale bedrock. The study was carried out adjacent to a former
   waste burial site in Waste Area Grouping 5 (WAG5) on the Oak Ridge
   Reservation, Oak Ridge, TN. A contaminant plume containing TCE and its
   daughter products were detected downgradient from the buried waste pits,
   with most of the contamination occurring in the upper 6 in of the
   bedrock. The monitoring well array consists of a 35-m-long transect of
   multilevel sampling wells, situated along a line between the waste pits
   and a seep which discharges into a small stream. Concentrations of
   volatile organic carbons (VOCs) were highest in the waste trenches and
   decreased with distance downgradient towards the seep. Sampling wells
   indicated the presence of overlapping plumes of TCE,
   cis-dichloroethylene (cDCE), vinyl chloride (VC), ethylene, ethane, and
   methane, with the daughter products extending further downgradient than
   the parent (TCE). This type of distribution suggests anaerobic
   biodegradation. Measurements of redox potential at the site indicated
   that iron-reduction, sulfate reduction, and potentially methanogensis
   were occurring and are conducive to dechlorination of TCE. Bacteria
   enrichment of groundwater samples revealed the presence of
   methanotrophs, methanogens, iron-reducing bacteria and sulfate-reducing
   bacteria, all of which have previously been implicated in anaerobic
   biodegradation of TCE. 16S rDNA sequence from DNA extracted from two
   wells were similar to sequences of organisms previously implicated in
   the anaerobic biodegradation of chlorinated solvents. The combined data
   strongly suggest that anaerobic biodegradation of the highly chlorinated
   compounds is occurring. Aerobic biodegradation may also be occurring in
   oxygenated zones, including near a seep where groundwater exits the
   site, or in the upper bedrock during seasonal fluctuations in water
   table elevation and oxygen levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All

Abstract = {{`Attribute' sweet corn containing a cry1Ab gene (Bt11 Event) from
   Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner was registered for commercial use in
   1998. A requirement of registration was to conduct baseline
   susceptibility studies to Cry1Ab toxin in fall armyworm populations
   collected from sweet corn growing areas in south Texas and south
   Florida. In addition, fall arnnyworm populations collected in sweet corn
   growing areas must be annually monitored for changes in susceptibility
   to the Cry1Ab protein. Fall armyworm larvae were collected near Belle
   Glade, FL, Homestead, FL, Weslaco, TX, and Corpus Christi, TX, in 1998
   through 2000 and evaluated for susceptibility to Cry1Ab toxin. The
   Tifton Laboratory colony of fall armyworm that has been in culture for
   more than 10 yrs was used as the susceptible control. Comparison of the
   calculated LC(50)s for the various colonies did not indicate an
   appreciable change in susceptibility during the period 1998-2000. These
   data provide baseline information as to the susceptibility of the fall
   arnnyworm to Cry1Ab protein produced in insect-resistant transgenic
   corn.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring processes that affect plant population dynamics and determine
   community structure is central in forest restoration ecology. To study
   effects of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus elaphus) on
   buckbrush (Ceanothus fendleri Gray), we built exclosures around 90
   plant-centered plots in 3 ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forest
   restoration management units and compared vegetative and flowering
   characteristics with unprotected plots for 2 years. On unprotected
   plots, 69\% of the current-year branches were browsed during the first
   year and 44\% were browsed the second year. There was no difference in
   number of aerial stems or current-year branches in the first year, yet
   stems on protected plots were longer (24.1 cm; P < 0.01) and retained
   more than 4 times the current-year biomass (1.4 g stem(-1); P < 0.01)
   than those on unprotected plots (12.9 cm and 0.3 g stem(-1),
   respectively). Stem number, length and diameter, number of current-year
   branches, and current-year biomass on protected plots were all greater
   (P < 0.01) than on unprotected plots in the second year. Stems on
   protected plots had significantly higher (P < 0.01) length-diameter
   ratios and had fewer current-year branches per unit length (P < 0.05)
   than unprotected stems. Flowering stems were found on significantly (P <
   0.05) more protected plots (55\%) than unprotected plots (8\%) in the
   second year. Effects of ungulate herbivores on buckbrush size, stem
   recruitment, morphology, and flowering represent important constraints
   to early understory development and restoration in this Southwest
   ponderosa pine forest.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology and behavior of many nocturnal arthropods render it
   difficult to create identifying marks on individuals that are visible
   and recognizable under natural conditions. Effective monitoring of
   organisms in their natural habitats is essential to understanding
   several aspects of population biology, ethology, and social
   interactions. Several marking techniques have been developed for both
   individual and mass mark-release-recapture studies. However, unique
   recognition of night-active individuals remains a problem. Here we
   present an apparatus and technique to accurately deposit fluorescent
   powders to create distinct marking patterns on small nocturnal
   arthropods. This system was evaluated using three genera of spiders
   (Achaearanea and Anelosimus: Theridiidae, and Pholcus: Pholcidae) and a
   pyralid moth (Achroia grisella: Pyralidae). Laboratory experiments were
   conducted to test the applicability of this marking device and method
   under controlled conditions, as well as test the effectiveness and
   efficiency of this device. The device was then used in the field on
   natural populations. This precision powder application device and
   marking technique allowed us to document behaviors and interactions that
   were not possible with other marking techniques. This technique provided
   a means of studying groups of organisms that have proven to be a
   challenge for researchers to effectively mark and monitor.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature-induced pH changes in white muscle tissue of three eelpout
   populations with different levels of eurythermy (the cold stenothermal
   Antarctic species Pachycara brachycephalum and the temperate eelpout
   Zoarces viviparus from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea) were monitored
   online by use of in vivo P-31-NMR in unrestrained, unanaesthetized fish.
   An intracellular pH (pH(i)) change of around -0.015pH units/degreesC was
   observed in all eelpout populations in accordance-with the alpha-stat
   hypothesis. The pH change was completed earlier (within 4h) in the
   stenothermal Antarctic eelpout than in the Baltic population (within 8
   h) and latest (not within 12 h) in the eurythermal North Sea population.
   These findings confirm the hypothesis that the kinetics of
   temperature-dependent pHi regulation is reflected by the relative
   contribution of active and passive processes to a temperature-induced pH
   change. The extent of passively induced pHi changes is in line with the
   general hypothesis that the temperature-dependent adjustment of pHi
   occurs mostly by active mechanisms in eurythermal animals, whereas in
   stenothermal animals pH changes are largely elicited by passive
   processes. Temperature changes had no influence on high-energy
   phosphates like phosphocreatine and ATP or on the Gibbs free energy
   change-of ATP hydrolysis (DeltaG/Deltaxi). (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Lake Victoria, East Africa, has been the site of many recent studies
   measuring mercury (Hg) concentrations in water, fish, sediment, soil,
   and humans. Most of these studies were motivated by concerns about Hg
   contamination from processing of gold ore on the southern shores. Total
   Hg (THg) concentrations in fish were usually below permissible World
   Health Organization ( WHO) concentrations and international marketing
   limits and do not threaten the lucrative export industry. Nile perch 3 -
   10 kg and most > 10 kg had THg concentrations above the WHO threshold
   concentrations for at-risk groups ( 200 ng/g). Elevated THg
   concentrations in large Nile perch are not of major concern because Nile
   perch are rarely consumed by the people living on Lake Victoria and very
   large Nile perch are becoming increasingly rare in catches. Water THg
   concentrations were below Canadian drinking water guidelines but were
   elevated relative to those in the northern Great Lakes. Sediment and
   soil THg concentrations were within international guidelines and are
   comparable to those in northern latitudes but are lower than those in
   the Amazon basin. Biomass burnings and soil erosion are estimated to be
   the major sources of THg for the lake and probably constitute a larger
   source of THg than gold mining in Tanzania. THg concentrations in urine
   and hair from human volunteers indicate that while gold miners and
   frequent skin-bleaching cream users are at risk of inorganic mercury
   poisoning, the rest of the population, including fishermen, is not.
   Human exposure assessments demonstrated that fish consumption and soil
   geophagy constitute major sources of THg for humans, but the total
   estimated daily intake of THg was below the Health Canada tolerable
   daily intake (TDI) limits. The use of beauty creams containing high
   inorganic Hg concentrations, however, caused the estimated THg exposure
   to exceed the TDI. The high THg content in the hair of regular cream
   users supports this assessment. The nutritional benefits of fish and
   soil geophagy outweigh the risk of THg poisoning. Still, due to the
   importance of those natural items as a THg source to humans, as well as
   the changing nature of Lake Victoria, regular monitoring and risk
   assessments need to be carried out in the Lake Victoria catchment.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed 23 years of monitoring data from a bighorn sheep (Ovis
   canadensis) population to determine whether fecal nitrogen (FN),
   expected to reflect diet quality, can be used to track population
   nutritional status over the long term. We considered 3 measures of FN:
   its maximum value each spring (FN peak), the date of the peak, and the
   area under the curve relating julian date to summer FN (FN-total). We
   first determined the sources of variation in these 3 measures.
   Population density had a strong negative effect on FN-total while summer
   precipitation was positively related to FN-total, suggesting that diet
   quality declined with increasing density and improved with
   precipitation. Most sheep were recaptured every year, allowing us to
   assess FN as an indicator of nutritional condition by examining the
   relationships between summer mass gain and both FN peak and FN-total.
   The value of FN peak was not related to summer mass gain for any sex-age
   class, but FN-total was positively related to Summer mass gain of
   nonlactating females and yearling females. Our results suggest that FN
   can be used as an index of forage quality over several years. Over
   several years, FN also reflects aspects of bighorn sheep body growth and
   is correlated with changes in density that may ultimately affect
   population performance. Short-term monitoring of FN, however, may not
   provide much useful information.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea)
   appear to have declined in many portions of their range. A standardized
   survey and monitoring program is not available to quantity changes in
   abundance or distribution. Before a standardized survey method is
   selected for long-term, continent-wide burrowing owl monitoring,
   potential survey protocols should be rigorously tested. We evaluated 3
   potential burrowing owl survey methods: line transect, roadside
   point-count, and driving surveys. We also examined the effectiveness of
   using call-broadcasts on point-count surveys to increase detection
   probability. We conducted 3 replicate burrowing owl surveys (either
   point-count or driving surveys) along 1,350 kin of roads (114 survey
   routes) in eastern Wyoming, USA, between June and August 2000. Detection
   probability varied among observers for both point-count and driving
   surveys. Detection probability was higher on point-count surveys ((x)
   over bar = 64.3\%) compared to driving surveys ((x) over bar = 37.5\%),
   and point-count surveys sampled a larger effective area away from the
   road. Walking line-transect Surveys proved ineffective and inefficient
   for monitoring burrowing owls at large (statewide) scales. Nest-site
   detection probability was 47\% during driving detection trials and 79\%
   during point-count detection trials. We detected over twice as many owls
   per unit distance on our point-count routes (0.038 owls/km) compared to
   our driving routes (0.016 owls/km), but detected more owls per unit Lime
   on our driving routes (0.339 owls/hr vs. 0.229 owls/hr on point-count
   routes). We detected 22\% more Owls using call-broadcast even though all
   of our detections on point-count surveys were visual rather than aural.
   Estimates of breeding density were fairly similar based on our driving
   and point-count surveys (0.110 and 0.074 nest sites/km(2),
   respectively). Standardized point-counts using call-broadcast along
   roadsides offer the best approach for monitoring population trends of
   burrowing owls at large (statewide) spatial scales. Based on our
   results, we developed a standardized survey protocol for monitoring
   burrowing owls at large spatial scales. Implementation of these
   monitoring protocols would provide more precise estimates of population
   trends of burrowing owls in North America.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Extensive research into the decline of the endangered burrowing owl
   (Athene cunicularia) has focused on breeding biology, but has largely
   ignored the post-fledging period. To determine whether post-fledging
   survival was an important factor in the decline, we used radiotelemetry
   to monitor post-fledging,juveniles in a migratory population of
   burrowing owls in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, during 1997-2000. As
   part of a concurrent study, 92\% of the owl pairs nested in artificial
   nest boxes, and 64\% received Supplemental food from hatch until
   fledging. Survival of juvenile owls during the 3-month, post-fledging
   period was significantly higher in 1997 (1.00, n = 12) than 1998-2000
   (0.55 {[}95\% CI: 0.44 to 0.70], n = 64; P = 0.02). Unusually high
   survival during 1997 may have been related to the unusually high
   abundance of voles (Microtus spp.) that year. From 1998 to 2000, 27 of
   64 radiomarked owls died. Predators caused the majority of post-fledging
   mortality (15 of 27), with juveniles at greatest risk the first 14 days
   after fledging. Other sources of mortality were related to anthropogenic
   factors (5 of 27) and starvation (5 of 27). Following each of 3 years
   with moderate juvenile post-fledging survival, the breeding population
   of burrowing owls declined 11-48\% and contained correspondingly few
   yearling recruits ((x) over bar = 2.1\%). However, following the year of

Abstract = {{Waterfowl biologists need reliable predictors of brood and duckling
   survival to accurately estimate recruitment rates. We examined 30-day
   survival rates of gadwall (Anas strepera) broods (1992-1994) and
   ducklings (1990-1994) in eastern North Dakota, USA, during years when
   water conditions ranged from extremely dry to extremely wet. We
   evaluated effects of several variables on brood survival: (1) percent of
   seasonal wetland basins containing water, (2) Occurrence of rain on the
   current or 2 previous exposure days, (3) minimum ambient temperature
   averaged over the current and 2 previous exposure days, (4) hatch date,
   (5) duckling age, and (6) brood size. Only 9 of 58 radiomarked females
   lost. their entire broods; Kaplan-Meier 30-day survival rate for broods
   was 0.84. Brood size (adjusted for hatch date) was a better
   blood-survival predictor than were any of the environmental variables.
   Risk of total brood loss decreased by 24\% for each additional duckling
   in the brood. We monitored fates of 212 radiomarked ducklings from 94
   broods. Daily risk of death for ducklings was twice as high when
   seasonal ponds were scarce its when ponds were abundant. Duckling
   survival rate was lower during the first 7 days of life whether it
   rained or not; survival rate was greater for 8- to 30-day-old ducklings,
   but was reduced by rain. Thirty-day duckling survival was greatest when
   minimum daily temperatures exceeded 10 degreesC and no rain occurred. We
   attributed 86\% of 87 deaths of radiomarked ducklings to predation;
   American mink (Mustela. vison) accounted for greater than or equal
   to68\% of the 40 deaths for which predator type could be ascertained.
   Despite apparent resilience of gadwall populations during drought, our
   study documented a positive effect of seasonal wetland availability on
   gadwall duckling survival. Management efforts to improve recruitment
   will be more effective in years when most seasonal basins contain water.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the actual abundance of 12 confined populations of wild
   house mice (Mus musculus) with closed population estimates based on
   mark-recapture data. Goodness-of-tit tests consistently detected
   individual heterogeneity in capture probability. Estimators designed to
   take such heterogeneity into account were expected to perform best, and
   generally did. However, of the 9 abundance estimators we considered,
   only Chao's modified moment estimator had no obvious bias and produced
   confidence intervals that always included the actual population size.
   The reliability of the 9 estimators and minimum number known alive
   (MNA), as indices of abundance, was quantified by (1) linear regression,
   and (2) calculating a Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the
   ranking obtained using the index and the true ranking. We found Petersen
   estimates to provide the most accurate ranking, and MNA also performed
   well. Since Chao's modified moment estimator was designed for
   populations with high levels of heterogeneity and low average capture
   probability, we concluded that this is an accurate description of trap
   response for confined mice Populations. Body-length frequency
   distributions and sex ratios for mice caught once, more than once, and
   not at all revealed that body length and sex could explain some of the
   observed individual heterogeneity. Males were more likely to enter traps
   than females, and large juice were more likely to be trapped than small
   mice. Field populations of house mice are monitored regularly throughout
   southeastern Australia because high densities cause considerable damage
   to wheat crops and place Substantial stress oil farming communities. We
   found that field populations trapped during the breeding season exhibit
   heterogeneity in capture probability similar to that for confined
   populations, with the same relationships between capture probability
   sex, and body length. However, these relationships did not hold for the
   same field population later in the season when breeding and recruitment
   had ceased. Chao's modified moment estimator was applied to field data
   and found to be stable when populations were trapped for greater than or
   equal to5 nights, but unreliable trapped for <5 nights.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to enhance recovery of endangered Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus
   schauinslandi) require an understanding of factors influencing
   population dynamics. This study examines relationships between body
   condition and survival of monk seal pups at French Frigate Shoals and
   Laysan Island and El Nino events. Girth measurements and mass estimates
   were used as indicators of pup body condition, and survival was
   evaluated from weaning to age 2. Linear models and logistic regression
   analysis were used to evaluate El Nino effects. Temporal trends in mean
   girth, mass, and survival were identified at both study sites. After
   accounting for temporal trends, girths were 3.7 cm and 2.7 cm greater
   during El Nino years at French Frigate Shoals and Laysan Island,
   respectively. Average mass estimates were significantly greater during
   El Nino years at French Frigate Shoals (2.6 kg increase), but were not
   significantly different at Laysan Island (1.8 kg increase). Weaned pups
   born at French Frigate Shoals during El Nino years survived
   significantly better, but this effect was not detected at Laysan Island.
   El Nino events probably affect pup condition and survival, but these
   parameters need to be monitored during future El Nino events to clarify
   these relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial biota of a methanol-fed denitrification reactor used to
   treat seawater at the Montreal Biodome were investigated using
   culture-dependent and molecular biology methods. The microbiota
   extracted from the reactor carriers were cultivated on three media.
   Three isolate types were recovered and their 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
   genes were determined. The analysis showed that the isolate types were
   related to alpha-Proteobacteria. They are members of the Hyphomicrobium
   and Paracoccus genera and the Phyllobacteriaceae family. Uncultured
   bacteria were identified through a 16S rDNA library generated from total
   DNA extracted from the microbiota. Clones were screened for different
   restriction profiles and for different DGGE (denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis) migration profiles. More than 70\% of clones have the
   same restriction profile, and the sequence of representative clones
   showed a relation with the Methylophaga members of the Piscirickettsia
   family (7-Proteobacteria). Sequences from other profiles were related to
   bacterial species involved in denitrification. The number of species in
   the denitrification reactor was estimated at 15. Bacterial colonization
   on newly added carriers in the denitrification reactor was monitored by
   PCR-DGGE. The DGGE migration profiles evolved during the first 5 weeks
   and then remained essentially unchanged. PCR-DGGE was also used to
   monitor the microbial profiles in various aquarium locations. As
   expected, bacterial populations differed from one location to another,
   except for the sand and trickling filters which presented similar DGGE
   migration profiles.}},

Abstract = {{The interrelation of heterotrophic bacteria with bacterivorous protists
   has been widely studied in pelagic environments, but data on benthic
   habitats, especially in freshwater systems, are still scarce. We present
   a seasonal study focusing on bacterivory by heterotrophic
   nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates in the silty sediment of a temperate
   macrophyte-dominated oxbow lake. From January 2001 to February 2002 we
   monitored the standing stock of bacteria and protozoa, bacterial
   secondary production (BSP, H-3-thymidine, and C-14-leucine
   incorporation), and grazing rates of HNF and ciliates on bacteria (FLB
   uptake) in the oxic sediment of the investigated system. BSP ranged from
   470 to 4050 mug C L-1 wet sediment h(-1). The bacterial compartment
   turned out to be highly dynamic, indicated by population doubling times
   (0.6-10.0 d), which were comparable to those in the water column of the
   investigated system. Yet, the control mechanisms acting upon the
   bacterial population led to a relative constancy of bacterial standing
   stock during a year. Ingestion rates of protozoan grazers were 0-20.0
   bacteria HNF-1 h(-1) and 097.6 bacteria ciliate(-1) h(-1). HNF and
   ciliates together cropped 0-14 (mean 4)\% of BSP, indicating that they
   did not significantly contribute to benthic bacterial mortality during
   any period of the year. The low impact of protozoan grazing was due to
   the low numbers of HNF and ciliates in relation to bacteria (1.8-3.5 x
   10(4) bacteria HNF-1, 0.9-3.1 x 10(6) bacteria ciliate(-1)). Thus,
   grazing by HNF and ciliates could be ruled out as a parameter regulating
   bacterial standing stock or production in the sediment of the
   investigated system, but the factors responsible for the limitation of
   benthic protistan densities and the fate of benthic BSP remained
   unclear.}},

Abstract = {{New Zealand's native avifauna is threatened by introduced mammalian
   predators. Native species are often not the primary prey of these
   predators, which depend on introduced mice and rabbits as their primary
   food source. Theoretical models predict that predation risk for a
   subsidiary, or ``secondary{''} prey species is inversely proportional to
   its population size. This prediction was tested by a quasi-natural
   experiment in which four different sized prey ``colonies{''} were
   constructed at four existing sooty shearwater breeding sites. Domestic
   hens' eggs were placed in shearwater burrows immediately following the
   shearwater breeding season and egg predation rates monitored at five,
   ten and fifteen days. Treatments were switched between sites and the
   experiment run for a second time after a two-week stand-down period. The
   net effect of increasing colony size was to lower individual risk of
   predation. The larger number of individuals present served to
   effectively ``buffer,{''} or dilute, per-capita predation risk from
   predators whose numbers are fixed by extraneous factors: chiefly the
   abundance of their primary prey. Although eggs were removed more slowly
   from smaller colonies than from larger ones, each loss had a greater
   per-capita effect on individual mortality risk. The inverse density
   dependent relationship found between colony size and predation risk
   implies that predator population dynamics are largely independent of
   secondary prey numbers. Abundant introduced predators can therefore
   easily drive a small secondary prey population to extinction. Control of
   primary prey populations may be an important management tool in these
   circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{We studied a fluctuating population of the long-tail rice rat
   (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), the main Hantavirus vector in southern
   Chile, and spanning 19 years of monitoring. We determined that a
   first-order feedback structure and non-linear effects of Antarctic
   Oscillation Index (AAOI) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) explain
   96\% of the variation in annual per capita population growth rates. One
   important result of this study is that first-order feedback structure
   captures the essential features of population dynamics of long-tailed
   rice rats. This regulatory structure suggests that rice rats are limited
   by food, space or predators and regulated by intra-specific competition.
   The first-order dynamics observed in long-tailed rice rats strongly
   suggests that Hantavirus have no harmful effects on survival or
   reproductive processes. Besides the non-linear climatic signature in
   population dynamics, the periodic event of bamboo-flowering and mast
   seeding strongly influence rice rats population growth rates. Because of
   this, bamboo flowering may be used as a signal for forecasting long-tail
   rice rats outbreaks and for implementing information and health policies
   to avoid human-rodent contacts in specific areas. The observed effects
   of the two large-scale climatic indexes that influence climatic
   variability along southern Pacific Ocean, the AAOI and the SOI,
   emphasizes the role of considering non-linear feedback structures and
   climatic forces for understanding small rodent population dynamics.
   Because long-tailed rice rats represent the major Hantavirus reservoir
   in southern Chile and Argentina, we need to gain an in-depth
   understanding of the structure and functioning of these small rodent
   populations in face of the potential consequences of global change and
   climatic fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Post-release monitoring, including abundance estimation, is an important
   part of reintroductions, providing a basis for management intervention
   designed to achieve long-term persistence. The Arabian oryx Oryx
   leucoryx became extinct in the wild in 1972, surviving as captive
   populations. Since 1982 reintroductions of Arabian oryx have taken place
   in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Modelling of oryx population dynamics has
   highlighted the importance of precise estimation of population size (N).
   Between 1990 and 2000 three methods of estimating N have been applied in
   Mahazat as-Sayd protected area in Saudi Arabia: derived population
   estimates (DPE) based on known births and deaths, distance sampling, and
   mark-resighting (MR). This study assesses the feasibility and precision
   of these methods. Inability to assess precision, interdependence of
   consecutive estimates, and the assumption that all gains and losses are
   recorded, make DPE of limited value. At current densities, distance
   sampling along 455 km of driven transects yields too few detections to
   derive precise estimates of N. To achieve a coefficient of variation of
   20\% it would be necessary to drive up to c. 2,900 km of transect; this
   amount of survey effort could be achieved through pooling of data across
   repeat surveys of established transects. MR estimates, based on
   re-sighting of collared oryx, have the potential to yield the most
   precise estimates of N when the proportion of marked animals reaches
   30\% of the total population. The most reliable MR estimates available
   indicate the Mahazat as-Sayd Arabian oryx population had grown to > 400
   animals by 2000.}},

Abstract = {{Small populations are particularly susceptible to disturbance. Routine
   censusing to monitor changes is important for understanding both
   population dynamics and the effectiveness of conservation strategies.
   Mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei in the Virunga Volcanoes
   region of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have been
   censused five times since 1970. However, due to war and political unrest
   in the region since 1990, no census had been conducted since 1989, when
   the population was thought to number 324 gorillas. In 2000 we estimated
   population size using repeated observations of 17 habituated groups and
   information on 15 unhabituated groups obtained during patrols. The
   minimum population was 359 gorillas, and a best-case scenario correcting
   for groups that might not have been counted was 395. Using the minimum
   population and best-case scenario respectively, this represents a 0.9\%
   or 1.8\% annual growth rate over the last decade and 1.0\% or 1.3\%
   annual growth rate since 1972. This is lower than growth estimates made
   in several population viability analyses, but approximately 5\% of the
   1989 population is known to have died due to military activity over the
   last decade. Different subsets of the population exhibited different
   responses to disturbance caused by war. We discuss conservation
   strategies that are likely to have contributed to an increase in the
   gorilla population during this time of turmoil. While the population has
   grown, the results should be viewed with caution, not only because all
   known growth during the last decade can be attributed to one subset of
   the population, but also because the region is still plagued by
   political unrest.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread concern over the state of the environment and the impacts of
   anthropogenic activities on ecosystem services and functions has
   highlighted the need for high-quality, long-term datasets for detecting
   and understanding environmental change. In July 2001, an international
   conference reviewed progress in the field of long-term ecosystem
   research and monitoring (LTERM). Examples are given which demonstrate
   the need for long-term environmental monitoring and research, for
   palaeoecological reconstructions of past environments and for applied
   use of historical records that inform us of past environmental
   conditions. LTERM approaches are needed to provide measures of baseline
   conditions and for informing decisions on ecosystem management and
   environmental policy formulation. They are also valuable in aiding the
   understanding of the processes of environmental change, including the
   integrated effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers and pressures,
   recovery from stress and resilience of species, populations, communities
   and ecosystems. The authors argue that, in order to realise the full
   potential of LTERM approaches, progress must be made in four key areas:
   (i) increase the number, variety and scope of LTERM activities to help
   define the operational range of ecosystems; (ii) greater integration of
   research, monitoring, modelling, palaeoecological reconstruction and
   remote sensing to create a broad-scale early warning system of
   environmental change; (iii) development of inter-disciplinary approaches
   which draw upon social and environmental science expertise to understand
   the factors determining the vulnerability and resilience of the
   nature-society system to change; and (iv) more and better use of LTERM
   data and information to inform the public and policymakers and to
   provide guidance on sustainable development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{For almost four decades the British Trust for Ornithology has monitored
   populations of the commoner 35-50\% of species of British breeding
   birds. The monitoring involves surveillance of numbers, breeding output
   and survival rates across the whole of the United Kingdom. A formal
   alert system allows serious declines to be identified and brought to the
   attention not only of conservationists and those responsible for
   countryside policy but also the general public. Demographic modelling,
   the gathering of ancillary information and linked research programmes
   allow the causes of declines to be identified. The paper details the
   operation of the programme, illustrated by examples. The system has
   resulted in the widespread declines in farmland birds that occurred in
   the last quarter of the 20th century being brought to the attention of
   conservation scientists, campaigners, policy-makers, politicians and the
   public. From this (and from the associated understanding of the causes
   of the declines) have stemmed policies aimed at reducing the problems
   and a commitment by government to halt the declines. The success of the
   programme rests on scientifically rigorous design and analysis, on a
   partnership between volunteer birdwatchers (who do most of the
   fieldwork) and professional ecologists (responsible for design and
   analysis) and on effective interaction between scientists and policy
   makers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},
